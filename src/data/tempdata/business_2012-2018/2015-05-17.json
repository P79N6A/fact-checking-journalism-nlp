      "bodyText": "Asset managers that invest trillions of savers\u2019 money too often fail to challenge companies on excessive pay and bonuses, shareholder activist group ShareAction has said. Blue-chip City firms, including BlackRock, HSBC\u2019s global asset management division and Schroders, were found to have mostly sided with company management on controversial decisions over pay, which showed they were \u201cnot exercising their stewardship responsibilities\u201d the NGO said. The survey of the UK\u2019s 33 largest asset management firms, which look after \u00a313.8tn for pension savers, charities, universities, also singled out six investment managers for failing to be transparent. ShareAction studied some of the biggest shareholder rebellions of the 2014 annual general meeting season, a total of eight occasions when companies faced dissent from more than 30% of investors. The biggest corporate revolt was at trenchcoat maker Burberry, when just over half of investors voted against the company\u2019s remuneration report, after it came to light that its chief executive, Christopher Bailey, had been awarded a \u00a315m share award during his tenure as chief creative officer. Standard Chartered bank, the consumer goods conglomerate Reckitt Benckiser and drug company AstraZeneca, also faced rebellions, when a large minority of shareholders voted against executive pay deals. The AGM is one of the main ways investors can hold to account the chief executive and board of listed companies, although until the \u201cshareholder spring\u201d of 2012, most meetings were sleepy affairs with little dissent. Some asset managers, including Aberdeen Asset Management, Hermes and M&amp;G, continued this non-dissenting tradition at AGMs; the ShareAction report showed they sided with company boards on most controversial votes. In contrast, Threadneedle Asset Management, Aviva and Goldman Sachs were among the firms that more often voted against contentious pay awards. The same group of activist investors also tended to support resolutions on environmental and social issues, such as a target for ExxonMobil to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or an obligation on National Express to improve oversight of bus drivers\u2019 conditions. Other asset managers consistently voted against environmental and social resolutions, including Aberdeen Asset Management and the fund management arms of JP Morgan and UBS. Catherine Howarth, the chief executive of ShareAction, said: \u201cOur survey suggests a wide range of big names in asset management aren\u2019t exercising their stewardship responsibilities at some of the world\u2019s biggest companies.\u201d \u201cWhile the detail of any one vote may not be indicative of an approach, there does seem to be a pattern for some managers across the votes we looked at with significant shareholder dissent.

    "webTitle": "JCB boss says EU exit could lift burden of bureaucracy on UK businesses", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The top executives of JCB, one of the UK\u2019s biggest manufacturing companies, have said Britain should vote to leave the European Union if David Cameron fails to negotiate reductions to bureaucracy that weighs down UK businesses. Graeme MacDonald, who runs JCB for its billionaire owners, the Bamford family, said the EU was an important market for JCB, but he dismissed concerns about the impact on business if Britain voted to leave the single market. Asked if it would be better for the UK to quit an unreformed EU, he said: \u201cI think it would be, because I really don\u2019t think it would make a blind bit of difference to trade with Europe. There has been far too much scaremongering about things like jobs. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in anyone\u2019s interest to stop trade. I don\u2019t think we or Brussels will put up trade barriers.\u201d Meanwhile, chairman Lord Bamford told the BBC that the UK \u201ccould negotiate as our own country rather than being one of 28 nations in Brussels as we are today\u201d. JCB, the world\u2019s third biggest maker of construction equipment, has strong links to the Conservatives. Lord Bamford has given \u00a32.6m to the party in the past five years and was made a Tory peer in 2013. Bamford has been vociferous in calling for the government to promote UK manufacturers. He produced a report for Cameron in 2012 calling for a German-style long-term strategy to support manufacturing and exports. MacDonald said Britain was too important an export market for the EU to make drastic changes to trading conditions. For example, the UK is the fourth-biggest market for German cars, he said. JCB is building a new \u00a318m headquarters in Germany. \u201cWhat is needed is a lot less red tape and bureaucracy. Some of it is costly for us and quite frankly ridiculous. Whether that means renegotiating or exiting, I don\u2019t think it can carry on as it is. It\u2019s a burden on our business and it\u2019s easier selling to North America than to Europe sometimes.\u201d He said reducing red tape for business was Cameron\u2019s most important task when seeking concessions from other EU leaders. JCB\u2019s view is at odds with the views of other UK business leaders such as Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, the world\u2019s biggest advertising company, and Sir Michael Rake, BT\u2019s chairman. They have echoed Tony Blair\u2019s warning during the election campaign that Britain would suffer damaging instability before the referendum and after a vote to leave the EU. Cameron has promised to hold an in-out referendum by 2017 after seeking to renegotiate how the EU operates. His demands include an opt-out for Britain from the goal of an \u201cever closer union\u201d and greater powers for national parliaments to block EU legislation. Cameron\u2019s team is understood to be drawing up plans to bring the referendum forward to next year to avoid a clash with French and German elections in 2017. Amid growing talk of a possible \u201cBrexit\u201d in the wake of the election, MacDonald\u2019s comments are likely to be seized upon by Eurosceptic MPs such as Peter Bone and David Davis, already encouraged by Cameron\u2019s referendum promise. Many businesses are also keen for EU reform. A recent survey by the IoD, the business organisation representing a range of large and medium-sized companies across the UK, found 60% of their members said staying in the EU depended on successful reform in key areas, notably employment regulations. However Lucy Thomas, campaign director for Business for New Europe, which supports the UK staying in a reformed EU, said MacDonald was right to call for a reduction in EU bureaucracy but said a Brexit would damage Britain: if it left the EU it would have no say in the rules and would still have to accept them. \u201cOf course JCB and others could still sell their goods to Europe, but they would still have to meet EU standards whatever they happened to be. Surely a seat at the table when rules are decided is better than no say at all? She added: \u201cThere is also no guarantee of what \u2018out\u2019 would look like: British businesses could potentially see tariffs and other barriers imposed on their goods and services, making them far less competitive. \u201cWe also benefit from free trade deals with over 50 countries all over the world and outside the EU we would lose all of those. Renegotiating would take years and why would global powers listen to the UK with 65 million consumers more than the EU as a bloc with 500 million?\u201d \u201cCompanies who say they would reconsider their presence in the UK really mean it. They will go wherever makes business sense and if the UK is no longer competitive, they will not stay.\u201d The prospect of the UK leaving the EU was cited by banking group HSBC as one reason why it was considering moving its headquarters from London to the Far East. HSBC chairman Douglas Flint said at last month\u2019s annual meeting: \u201cIn February we published a major research study which concluded that working to complete the single market in services and reforming the EU to make it more competitive were far less risky than going it alone, given the importance of EU markets to British trade.\u201d The JCB chief executive was speaking as the firm revealed that it had made a profit of \u00a3303m last year, down from \u00a3313m in the previous year. Sales fell from \u00a32.7bn to \u00a32.5bn. JCB\u2019s UK business had been boosted by increased housebuilding and big infrastructure projects such as the Crossrail transport link in London. \u201cOur customers see this going on for another two years or more,\u201d he said.MacDonald also called on the Conservative government to make quicker decisions on big building projects now that it no longer needed to do deals with the Liberal Democrats. \u201cWith the coalition there was always an element of compromise. We\u2019ve been discussing for a long time HS2 or whether we should have an extra runway at Heathrow. The government needs to get on with it. We look at other economies around the world and they have built new airports while we\u2019ve been deciding whether to build a runway or not.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 May 2015. It originally said JCB made a profit of \u00a3313m last year; the figure should have been \u00a3303m. This has been corrected.",

The film project is being developed in partnership with US-based online ad agency Zooppa, and, according to a leaked email, was to be pitched at platforms such as Vice, the online news service. An email between Zooppa staff discussing the Shell brief makes it clear \u201cyou should NOT mention on your storyboard Arctic Oil\u201d. Environmentalists say Shell\u2019s involvement in exploiting reserves in the Arctic undermines its attempt to portray itself as a responsible oil and gas company keen to tackle global warming. While references to the Arctic are ruled out, the memo says \u201cyou can mention instead oil, gas, wind, nuclear energy\u201d. Greenpeace \u2013 which received the leaked email \u2013 believes the competition is being run in a bid to influence younger people in the runup to critical climate change talks convened by the United Nations in Paris in December. The email appears to be written by one Zooppa staffer to another giving advice about how to approach the project after \u201cI met on Monday with the Shell team\u201d. While the Anglo-Dutch group has insisted it needs to drill off Alaska this summer as part of an effort to see whether it can find oil and replenish the world\u2019s reserves, the email suggests Shell realises its operations in the Chukchi Sea could lose it support.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "What happens to video startups that make millions on Kickstarter", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Crowdfunding has been quite literally a game changer for many video technology startups and small companies, for which the prospect of millions in seed money might otherwise be unimaginable. Sites such as Kickstarter and Indigogo have given small video game developers the chance to compete with behemoths like Sony and Nintendo. Since its launch in 2009, Kickstarter \u2013 the largest crowdfunding site - says it has helped 1,408 video game projects reach or surpass funding goals to the tune of some $115m. But while the fundraising often has been remarkable, the end game hasn\u2019t always panned out. Ouya, a gaming company that grew from one of Kickstarter\u2019s most successful projects, is reportedly in trouble. The startup, which makes an Android-based home video game console, raised more than $8m through Kickstarter in 2012, wildly surpassing its $950,000 goal. Ouya went on to raise an additional $15m in funding from venture investors. But late last month, Fortune revealed the company was desperately seeking a buyer after failing to restructure its debt. In a confidential email obtained by the magazine, Ouya CEO Julie Uhrman wrote that the company\u2019s focus \u201cis trying to recover as much investor capital as possible\u201d. From the start, critics panned Ouya\u2019s product, claiming the console was poorly designed when early review units were released in April 2013. In a bid to stay afloat, the company recently secured venture debt estimated at more than $10m from TriplePoint Capital, which provides loans and leases to venture-backed companies, according to Fortune. Ouya declined to comment. Ouya is not the only gaming company to run into trouble following a triumphant crowdfunding campaign. Code Hero, an educational video game that aimed to help students in grades K-12 write code, raised $170,000 on Kickstarter in 2012. Yet the company that makes the game, Primer Labs, is accused of using the money too quickly and failing to communicate with backers, who have taken to the Kickstarter comments section to threaten lawsuits. The Code Hero website is now offline and Primer Labs\u2019 founder, Alex Peake, has admitted the project \u201cran out of money\u201d. Experts say the problem isn\u2019t getting people excited about games \u2013 it\u2019s that crowdfunding doesn\u2019t always translate into a viable business. \u201cWhen a game company can raise a huge chunk of money through crowdfunding, and isn\u2019t required to provide a detailed long-term plan, and isn\u2019t held accountable when they overspend or overschedule, well, let\u2019s just say failure isn\u2019t a big surprise to me,\u201d says Rick Hall, production director at the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy at the University of Central Florida. In one sense, Ouya has been a victim of its own success. It raised a tremendous amount of money in the initial phase, but experts say it failed to take steps to ensure that the console would generate enough revenue to keep the rest of the business breaking even. Additionally, its success at crowdfunding showed bigger, more established companies that there was a market for a budget video game console \u2013 and that raised the competitive stakes. \u201cTo work properly, the entrepreneur must have a hyperdeveloped sense of financial discipline,\u201d Hall says. \u201cThey have to treat the money as if it\u2019s their life\u2019s savings, rather than something they got for free off the internet.\u201d Financial planning is key to the long term success of a project, says game developer Christian Allen. His company, Serellan, developed Takedown: Red Sabre, an old-school tactical shooter game, after a Kickstarter campaign that beat its $200,000 goal to raise $221,000 in March 2012. Despite that initial success, Allen says the game is still widely viewed as a failure, in part due to technical issues at launch. Although he and his team fixed most of the glitches and released free content, Allen says they were unable to overcome the initial poor reviews. In hindsight, he says, the crowdfunding campaign taught him valuable lessons. \u201cBackers should have a real budget for their project,\u201d Allen says. \u201cWe ended up spending about 7% of our Kickstarter budget just on rewards, and another big chunk on taxes.\u201d Another kink, experts say, is that while crowdfunding offers a platform for exposure and easy funding, there\u2019s no guarantee that the product will be well-designed. \u201cThe real problem is that the product is not really tried out, as no experts in the relevant technology have tested the product and written reviews,\u201d says Cameron Tousi, a managing partner at IP Law Leaders who specializes in technology and IP law. \u201cThe result is a certain amount of lemmings marching off the cliff together.\u201d Despite recent, high-profile blunders, the numbers do seem to be on the side of the developers. According to a recent study from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, more than 90% of design, technology and video game projects that had reached their Kickstarter goal still existed one to four years after their campaign. Of these businesses, 32% reported revenues of more than $100,000 a year. \u201cWe\u2019re very clear about the fact that there is always risk involved in backing a project,\u201d says Luke Crane, games lead at Kickstarter. \u201cBut with the vast majority of projects, that risk turns out to have been worth taking.\u201d This is certainly the hope for the developers at Virtuix Omni, a virtual reality platform that looks a bit like a treadmill, allowing people to essentially walk and run within a game. Without a developed product, Virtuix would have had difficulty raising money from seasoned investors, CEO Jan Goetgeluk says, so Kickstarter seemed like a good choice. The developers reached their $150,000 funding goal in the first three and a half hours, and ended up with a total of $1.1m, making it one of the top 10 biggest technology Kickstarter campaigns at the time. Since then, the company has raised $8m from other institutional and private investors. The virtual treadmill has seen delays in shipping, but Goetgeluk says he hopes to ship around 4,000 units to his backers and preorder customers later this year. A lot of products do well on Kickstarter because of their \u201ccool factor\u201d, says Goetgeluk, but if no problem is solved or need fulfilled, the novelty wears off quickly. The treadmill will solve a problem that has been around for decades, he claims. \u201cVirtual reality is about to take off,\u201d Goetgeluk says. \u201cConsumers will want to walk and run naturally in the virtual world instead of sitting down and pushing buttons on a gamepad or keyboard.\u201d The trick, experts say, is to realize that crowdfunding is just the beginning. And in a market as diverse and complex as gaming, every last detail has to be considered. \u201cGamers have wild imaginations, and can make amazing games, but that\u2019s simply not enough to sustain a business for the long term,\u201d Hall says. \u201cThere is a machine that surrounds game development. It encompasses everything from publishing to R&amp;D, packaging and sales, accounting, distribution, and long-term business planning. Unlike the movies, you cannot simply \u2018build it, and they will come.\u2019\u201d Ultimately, making a video game is a complex artistic endeavor. With or without crowdfunding, the most successful games are still likely to be the ones made by experienced developers. Feargus Urquhart, CEO of Obsidian Entertainment and an industry veteran, created Pillars of Eternity, a video game that raised more than $4m on Kickstarter in 2012. The game was released to much critical acclaim, with an impressive score of 90/100 on Metacritic, a site that aggregates reviews. \u201cWe know all the stuff that needs to go in there,\u201d Urquhart says. \u201cThat\u2019s why people trusted that we could do this.\u201d Still, Urquhart encourages small companies to keep innovating, even if they fail. \u201cPeople are given this opportunity to try things they wouldn\u2019t normally be able to try,\u201d Urquhart says. \u201cThe side effect is failure but I don\u2019t think that failure is bad \u2013 it keeps the industry moving forward.\u201d",

The startup, which makes an Android-based home video game console, raised more than $8m through Kickstarter in 2012, wildly surpassing its $950,000 goal. Ouya went on to raise an additional $15m in funding from venture investors. But late last month, <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/04/28/exclusive-gaming-startup-ouya-needs-to-find-a-buyer-quickly/\">Fortune revealed the company was desperately seeking a buyer</a> after failing to restructure its debt. In a confidential email obtained by the magazine, Ouya CEO Julie Uhrman wrote that the company\u2019s focus \u201cis trying to recover as much investor capital as possible\u201d.</p> <p>From the start, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/04/07/ouya-early-reviews-trickle-in-and-theyre-not-pretty/\">critics panned Ouya\u2019s product</a>, claiming the <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review\">console was poorly designed</a> when early review units were released in April 2013. In a bid to stay afloat, the company recently secured <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/04/28/exclusive-gaming-startup-ouya-needs-to-find-a-buyer-quickly/\">venture debt estimated at more than $10m from TriplePoint Capital</a>, which provides loans and leases to venture-backed companies, according to Fortune. Ouya declined to comment.</p> <p>Ouya is not the only gaming company to run into trouble following a triumphant crowdfunding campaign. Code Hero, an educational video game that aimed to help students in grades K-12 write code, raised $170,000 on Kickstarter in 2012. Yet the company that makes the game, Primer Labs, is accused of using the money too quickly and failing to communicate with backers, who have taken to the Kickstarter comments section to threaten lawsuits. The Code Hero website is now offline and Primer Labs\u2019 founder, Alex Peake, has admitted the project <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/08/15/code-hero-one-year-later-money-lawsuits-and-poker/\">\u201cran out of money\u201d</a>. </p> <p>Experts say the problem isn\u2019t getting people excited about games \u2013 it\u2019s that crowdfunding doesn\u2019t always translate into a viable business. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/14/sega-saturn-how-one-decision-destroyed-playstations-greatest-rival\">Sega Saturn: how one decision destroyed PlayStation's greatest rival</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen a game company can raise a huge chunk of money through crowdfunding, and isn\u2019t required to provide a detailed long-term plan, and isn\u2019t held accountable when they overspend or overschedule, well, let\u2019s just say failure isn\u2019t a big surprise to me,\u201d says Rick Hall, production director at the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy at the University of Central Florida. </p> <p>In one sense, Ouya has been a victim of its own success. It raised a tremendous amount of money in the initial phase, but experts say it failed to take steps to ensure that the console would generate enough revenue to keep the rest of the business breaking even. Additionally, its success at crowdfunding showed bigger, more established companies that there was a market for a budget video game console \u2013 and that raised the competitive stakes.</p> <p>\u201cTo work properly, the entrepreneur must have a hyperdeveloped sense of financial discipline,\u201d Hall says. \u201cThey have to treat the money as if it\u2019s their life\u2019s savings, rather than something they got for free off the internet.\u201d</p> <p>Financial planning is key to the long term success of a project, says game developer Christian Allen. His company, Serellan, developed Takedown: Red Sabre, an old-school tactical shooter game, after a Kickstarter campaign that beat its $200,000 goal to raise $221,000 in March 2012. </p> <p>Despite that initial success, Allen says the game is still widely viewed as a failure, in part due to technical issues at launch. Although he and his team fixed most of the glitches and released free content, Allen says they were unable to overcome the initial poor reviews. In hindsight, he says, the crowdfunding campaign taught him valuable lessons. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/26/kickstarter-crowdfunding-booming-britain\">Kickstarter: how crowdfunding is booming in Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBackers should have a real budget for their project,\u201d Allen says. \u201cWe ended up spending about 7% of our Kickstarter budget just on rewards, and another big chunk on taxes.\u201d</p> <p>Another kink, experts say, is that while crowdfunding offers a platform for exposure and easy funding, there\u2019s no guarantee that the product will be well-designed. </p> <p>\u201cThe real problem is that the product is not really tried out, as no experts in the relevant technology have tested the product and written reviews,\u201d says Cameron Tousi, a managing partner at IP Law Leaders who specializes in technology and IP law. \u201cThe result is a certain amount of lemmings marching off the cliff together.\u201d</p> <p>Despite recent, high-profile blunders, the numbers do seem to be on the side of the developers. According to a recent study from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, more than 90% of design, technology and video game projects that had <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2376997\">reached their Kickstarter goal still existed one to four years after their campaign</a>. Of these businesses, 32% reported revenues of more than $100,000 a year. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re very clear about the fact that there is always risk involved in backing a project,\u201d says Luke Crane, games lead at Kickstarter. \u201cBut with the vast majority of projects, that risk turns out to have been worth taking.\u201d</p> <p>This is certainly the hope for the developers at Virtuix Omni, a virtual reality platform that looks a bit like a treadmill, allowing people to essentially walk and run within a game.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fb5ea51d051a26d89b325e5a01576d6314ff58f4\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431708879709/06b8e52c-2021-4105-98ae-f99d890819c1-460x382.jpeg\" alt=\"Skyrim virtual reality game\" width=\"460\" height=\"382\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Virtuix Omni</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Virtuix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Without a developed product, Virtuix would have had difficulty raising money from seasoned investors, CEO Jan Goetgeluk says, so Kickstarter seemed like a good choice. The developers reached their $150,000 funding goal in the first three and a half hours, and ended up with a total of $1.1m, making it one of the top 10 biggest technology Kickstarter campaigns at the time. Since then, the company has raised $8m from other institutional and private investors.</p> <p>The virtual treadmill has seen delays in shipping, but Goetgeluk says he hopes to ship around 4,000 units to his backers and preorder customers later this year. </p> <p>A lot of products do well on Kickstarter because of their \u201ccool factor\u201d, says Goetgeluk, but if no problem is solved or need fulfilled, the novelty wears off quickly. The treadmill will solve a problem that has been around for decades, he claims.</p> <p>\u201cVirtual reality is about to take off,\u201d Goetgeluk says. \u201cConsumers will want to walk and run naturally in the virtual world instead of sitting down and pushing buttons on a gamepad or keyboard.\u201d</p> <p> The trick, experts say, is to realize that crowdfunding is just the beginning. And in a market as diverse and complex as gaming, every last detail has to be considered. </p> <p>\u201cGamers have wild imaginations, and can make amazing games, but that\u2019s simply not enough to sustain a business for the long term,\u201d Hall says. \u201cThere is a machine that surrounds game development. It encompasses everything from publishing to R&amp;D, packaging and sales, accounting, distribution, and long-term business planning.

Speaking at the Co-op\u2019s annual general meeting, Richard Pennycook, the chief executive, said a series of pilot programmes would begin around the country during the summer with a view to making customers want to take out membership. The Co-op \u2013 which plunged to a record \u00a32.5bn loss in 2013 amid a scandal in its banking arm \u2013 is owned by its 7 million members and also by independent societies, which together control 22% of its operations. Pennycook, whose \u00a32.5m pay deal was criticised by members at the AGM on Saturday, said \u201cright now the majority of customers don\u2019t see the point\u201d of taking out membership. \u201cGetting our proposition right is the challenge we are working on right now,\u201d he said. The supermarket sector is undergoing intense pressure because of customers\u2019 changing shopping habits and the rise of discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Co-op has stepped back from a rapid expansion into supermarkets to focus more on convenience stores. The pay of Pennycook and former directors of the Co-op came under sustained criticism during the AGM, the first to be held under a one-member-one-vote system that replaced the block vote process used in the past. Anout 2.5 million members met the criteria to vote and around 90,000 did so on a range of topics, such as remuneration, boardroom elections and whether to keep subscribing to the Co-op party, which is aligned to Labour. Pennycook became chief executive after Euan Sutherland walked out last year in a row over his \u00a36.6m pay deal over two years. Pennycook said the Co-op was becoming a role-model for how to turn around businesses but said it would be some time before the dividend \u2013 known as the divi \u2013 could be restored. \u201cThere are no quick fixes. Wouldn\u2019t it be lovely if there were. The damage has been too great and too deep,\u201d Pennycook said. The four hour AGM was chaired by Allan Leighton, the former Royal Mail chair who is best known for turning around Asda, and was constantly interrupted by hecklers raising subjects from pay to the process used to name three new member nominated directors to the board. Protests were registered against Leighton\u2019s re-election to the board, as well as Pennycook\u2019s. Some 17% voted against Leighton and the dissent rose towards 30% when deliberate abstentions were included. Some 35% of members voted against Hazel Blears, the former Labour MP, taking up one of the member-nominated directors seats. Leighton has pledged to hold an election for a fourth member-nominated director in six months and make efforts to hold contested elections for the roles in the future after the Midcountries threatened the Co-op with an injunction over the process this year. There were two motions on political donations. The one brought by the board failed but the one brought by members, to keep giving \u00a31m a year to the Co-op, passed with a narrow margin.",

      "bodyText": "A Swedish firm believes that it can take away the frustration of bringing home shoes that don\u2019t fit by using spatial awareness cameras to provide a 3D scan of exactly what each person\u2019s foot looks like. Volumental, based in Stockholm, has developed software to take a lifelike image of the foot, which can then be used to make either shoes to fit exactly or find ones which are more suitablefrom the shelves. \u201cOur vision is that the system of going around the stores, trying on lots of shoes or jeans and different products and having a problem of not knowing whether you are medium or large ... I think that system will be completely gone in 10 years. Instead it will be size me,\u201d co-founder Caroline Walerud says. \u201cYou will only be given products that fit your body shape. We are going to create that standard for how to size people. In the first, for shoes and then for other products.\u201d The technology emerged from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm where researchers were working on trying to make robots \u201csee\u201d by using cameras used for gaming consoles in 2012. They started by filming around objects like a table or a sofa so they could draw up a 3D image. They then looked at how to commercialise the technology and settled on shoes. \u201cThe concept was to 3D scan anything, we can digitise the world. The \u2018YouTube of 3D\u2019. That was a very wide vision and it didn\u2019t really solve a problem, it was just the technology basically looking for a solution,\u201d Walerud says. \u201c I would say we have done a huge shift there in really thinking about the market and the customers.\u201d The software uses depth cameras such as Microsoft\u2019s Kinect or Intel\u2019s RealSense, which are connected to computers and then moved around the foot in order to build the 3D image. \u201cYou film around your face or your foot and you get a direct 3D model of your foot with all of the measurements. We analyse it and output the measurements you need to create a custom product,\u201d she says. \u201cIt uses both the intelligence from the sensor as well as previous intelligence we have gathered about feet in the background. When the 3D image is stored in the computer, it can then be used to make custom products which fit exactly instead of being slightly outsized. In footwear, the company has found an area where the 3D scanning would reach a need, said Walerud, as many people find there are inconsistencies in size due to the shape \u2013 not the length \u2013 of the foot. A typical complaint is that brands have different sizings. \u201cIt is very hard for people to describe the shape of a foot however you do it,\u201d she said. Volumental aims to commercialise their software in two ways. Firstly brands will have hardware in the store where the exact profile of someone\u2019s foot can be drawn up. The stage after that is to develop a consumer product where people will be able to use a laptop or phone to put together a 3D image from home. As well as being able to create personally customisable shoes, the software would also be able to find a shoe that is a better fit for the customer, said Walerud. The company is currently working with Italian shoe producer Scarosso on a system where people will be able to scan their feet and is expected to announce link-ups with other firms in the future. The most immediate problem to face the company is one of hardware. Without depth cameras becoming standard in mobile phones and laptops, the software appears ahead of its time. Walerud estimates that the cameras will become typical in mobile phones by 2017 when they will also be used for enhanced security and the ability to navigate screens without actually touching the device. Another concern is that customisable shoes may be seen as something for specialist shoemakers and not for mass market brands. Walerud says that new manufacturing techniques will allow for specially designed shoes to be made at cheaper prices in the future. \u201cThe biggest mountain here is we are creating something new. We are trying to change how people design, manufacture, buy and sell products. All those things that are trying to change that paradigm means that there is a lot of unknowns there still,\u201d she says. The company has 20 staff in its Stockholm headquarters and has received $5m (\u00a33.18m) in funding so far. How it intends to make money through the software is by licensing it out. When a consumer product comes out, retailers who make shoes for people who scan their details via the application will be charged and not the customer, said Walerud. A bespoke world While they are starting with feet, Volumental also work on 3D scanning the face with the view to make glasses, helmets and earphones bespoke to the individual body. Personalised shoes could also be aided with 3D weaving, a concept where the exact profile of a person\u2019s shoe sole can be created in a new technique made by Nigerian American designer Oluwaseyi Susanna. \u2022 You can read our archive of The innovators columns here or on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

      "body": "<p>A Swedish firm believes that it can take away the frustration of bringing home shoes that don\u2019t fit by using spatial awareness cameras to provide a 3D scan of exactly what each person\u2019s foot looks like.</p> <p>Volumental, based in Stockholm, has developed software to take a lifelike image of the foot, which can then be used to make either shoes to fit exactly or find ones which are more suitablefrom the shelves.</p> <p>\u201cOur vision is that the system of going around the stores, trying on lots of shoes or jeans and different products and having a problem of not knowing whether you are medium or large ... I think that system will be completely gone in 10 years. Instead it will be size <em>me</em>,\u201d co-founder Caroline Walerud says.</p> <p>\u201cYou will only be given products that fit your body shape. We are going to create that standard for how to size people. In the first, for shoes and then for other products.\u201d</p> <p>The technology emerged from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm where researchers were working on trying to make robots \u201csee\u201d by using cameras used for gaming consoles in 2012.</p> <p>They started by filming around objects like a table or a sofa so they could draw up a 3D image. They then looked at how to commercialise the technology and settled on shoes.</p> <p>\u201cThe concept was to 3D scan anything, we can digitise the world. The \u2018YouTube of 3D\u2019. That was a very wide vision and it didn\u2019t really solve a problem, it was just the technology basically looking for a solution,\u201d Walerud says.</p> <p>\u201c I would say we have done a huge shift there in really thinking about the market and the customers.\u201d</p> <p>The software uses depth cameras such as Microsoft\u2019s Kinect or Intel\u2019s RealSense, which are connected to computers and then moved around the foot in order to build the 3D image.</p> <p>\u201cYou film around your face or your foot and you get a direct 3D model of your foot with all of the measurements. We analyse it and output the measurements you need to create a custom product,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIt uses both the intelligence from the sensor as well as previous intelligence we have gathered about feet in the background.</p> <p>When the 3D image is stored in the computer, it can then be used to make custom products which fit exactly instead of being slightly outsized. </p> <p>In footwear, the company has found an area where the 3D scanning would reach a need, said Walerud, as many people find there are inconsistencies in size due to the shape \u2013 not the length \u2013 of the foot. A typical complaint is that brands have different sizings. \u201cIt is very hard for people to describe the shape of a foot however you do it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Volumental aims to commercialise their software in two ways. Firstly brands will have hardware in the store where the exact profile of someone\u2019s foot can be drawn up. The stage after that is to develop a consumer product where people will be able to use a laptop or phone to put together a 3D image from home. </p> <p>As well as being able to create personally customisable shoes, the software would also be able to find a shoe that is a better fit for the customer, said Walerud. The company is currently working with Italian shoe producer Scarosso on a system where people will be able to scan their feet and is expected to announce link-ups with other firms in the future.</p> <p>The most immediate problem to face the company is one of hardware. Without depth cameras becoming standard in mobile phones and laptops, the software appears ahead of its time.</p> <p>Walerud estimates that the cameras will become typical in mobile phones by 2017 when they will also be used for enhanced security and the ability to navigate screens without actually touching the device.</p> <p>Another concern is that customisable shoes may be seen as something for specialist shoemakers and not for mass market brands. Walerud says that new manufacturing techniques will allow for specially designed shoes to be made at cheaper prices in the future.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest mountain here is we are creating something new. We are trying to change how people design, manufacture, buy and sell products. All those things that are trying to change that paradigm means that there is a lot of unknowns there still,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The company has 20 staff in its Stockholm headquarters and has received $5m (\u00a33.18m) in funding so far. How it intends to make money through the software is by licensing it out. When a consumer product comes out, retailers who make shoes for people who scan their details via the application will be charged and not the customer, said Walerud.<br></p> <h2>A bespoke world</h2> <p>While they are starting with feet, Volumental also work on 3D scanning the face with the view to make glasses, helmets and earphones bespoke to the individual body. Personalised shoes could also be aided with 3D weaving, a concept where the exact profile of a person\u2019s shoe sole can be created in a new technique made by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/03/the-innovators-the-3d-weaving-machine-putting-new-heart-into-soles\">Nigerian American designer Oluwaseyi Susanna</a>.<br></p> <p>\u2022 You can read our archive of The innovators columns <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/series/the-innovators\">here </a>or <a href=\"http://www.biginnovationcentre.com/the-innovators-column\">on the Big Innovation Centre website</a> where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Yanis Varoufakis rues the day when Greece joined the euro. The Greek finance minister says his country would be better off if it was still using the drachma. Deep down, he says, all 18 countries using the single currency wish that the idea had been strangled at birth but understand that once you are in you don\u2019t get out without a catastrophe. All of that is true, and explains why Greece is involved in a game of chicken with all the other players in this drama: the International Monetary Fund, the European commission, the European Central Bank and the German government. Varoufakis wants more financial help but not if it means sending the Greek economy into a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d. Greece\u2019s creditors will not stump up any more cash until Athens sticks to bailout conditions that Varoufakis says would do just that. Things will come to a head this summer because it is clear Greece cannot make all the debt repayments that are coming up. It has to find \u20ac10bn (\u00a37.3bn) in redemptions to the IMF, the ECB and other bondholders before the end of August and the money is not there. Greece\u2019s creditors know that and are prepared to let the government in Athens stew. They know that Greece really has only two choices: surrender or leave the euro, and since it has said it wants to stay inside the single currency, they expect the white flag to be fluttering any time soon. Greece\u2019s willingness to go ahead with the privatisation of its largest port, Piraeus, will be seen as evidence by the hardliners in Brussels and Berlin that they have been right to take a tough approach in negotiations with the Syriza-led government. But before he admits he has lost the game of chicken, Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, should think hard about Varoufakis\u2019s analysis. Was it a mistake for Greece to join the euro? Clearly, the answer is yes. Would Greece be better off with the drachma? Given that the economy has shrunk by 25% in the past five years and is still shrinking, again the answer is yes. Can you leave the euro and return to the drachma without a catastrophe? Undoubtedly there would be massive costs from doing so, including credit controls to prevent currency flight, and a profound shock to business and consumer confidence . There are also the practical difficulties involved in substituting one currency for another. In a way, though, this is not the question the Greek government should be asking itself. Greece has been suffering an economic catastrophe since 2010. It is suffering from an economic catastrophe now and will continue to suffer from an economic catastrophe if it stays in the euro without generous debt forgiveness and policies that facilitate, rather than impede, growth. So the real question is not whether leaving the euro would be a catastrophe, because it would. The real question is whether it would be more of a catastrophe than staying in. There are both political and economic dimensions to this question. Politically, Tsipras has a real dilemma: the Greek people voted for less austerity, Greece\u2019s creditors want no let-up in austerity. He can please one or the other but not both. Bowing the knee to Angela Merkel would allow Greece to get access to the short-term finance that will allow it to pay its debts, but it will be political suicide for Syriza. Sooner or later, Tsipras has to decide what he wants to do: continue with a populist approach that is incompatible with euro membership or return reluctantly to the policies that have been pursued by the centre-left and centre-right governments since the crisis erupted. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany\u2019s finance minister, has suggested that one solution would be for Greece to hold a referendum on whether it wants to go or stay. The message coming out of Berlin is that Germany doesn\u2019t care much either way. If Greece wants to knuckle down to structural reform, that\u2019s fine. If Greece wants to return to the drachma, that\u2019s also fine. Sch\u00e4uble strongly suspects that faced with the choice, Greece would vote to remain a member of the single currency. But plebiscites are funny things, and the question asked would matter. The answer to the question \u201cdo you want Greece to continue using the euro?\u201d, would be different to \u201cdo you want Greece to continue using the euro if it means cuts in wages and pensions?\u201d. Germany should also not underestimate how strongly resentment still burns in Greece about how the country suffered when it was occupied during the second world war and how many Greeks feel they are being deliberately punished for choosing the sort of government that doesn\u2019t suit the rest of the eurozone. When it comes to the economics, the question is whether Greece would get the pain over more quickly by having control over its own affairs. Roger Bootle and Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics think that might be the case, and say Iceland\u2019s experience after the country\u2019s severe banking crisis in 2008 is worth looking at. No question, Iceland had a very tough time. There were massive capital outflows from its over-extended banking sector, and its currency, the krona, depreciated by 40%. The economy contracted sharply, the IMF was called in and capital controls were introduced. But, as Bootle and Hinds note, Iceland has bounced back. It has grown in every year since 2011 and national output is just about back to pre-crisis levels. The inflation caused by the depreciation of the krona has been tame and growth prospects are rosy. The fall in the krona was important, since it made exports cheaper and provided a boost to tourism, where the number of visitors has risen by 60% to 800,000 a year between 2008 and 2014. \u201cThe fall in the krona boosted net trade by enough to kick-start Iceland\u2019s economic recovery without the need for the aggressive wage and price adjustments that have occurred in the eurozone periphery. Iceland was also able to tighten fiscal policy less aggressively than the periphery. Iceland\u2019s fall in GDP of about 12% was around half as short as that seen in Greece since 2008.\u201d Bootle and Hinds say that Greece, too, would see tourism benefit from a cheaper currency, while the vast amount of unused capacity in the economy would limit the extent of the increase in inflation caused by the devaluation that would follow euro exit. Capital controls would harm the economy, as they have in Iceland, but might be needed even if Greece stays inside the single currency. The weaker currency that would result from leaving the euro is not a get out of jail free card, far from it. But after five years of hard labour, staying in looks like a life sentence without remission.",

      "body": "<p>It is a heart-warming sight that deserves to be bottled. On a sunny May morning in east Suffolk as far as the eye can see, the flat but gently rolling fields are a vibrant shade of yellow. Bees and butterflies are flitting around the blooming rape flowers which will gradually die off, leaving the seedpods to be harvested in July and August.</p> <p>This scene of expanding fields of gold is being replicated across the UK as farmers turn more of their land over to growing rapeseed. Retail experts report it is now the fastest growing vegetable oil in the UK, with supermarkets expanding their ranges to meet shoppers\u2019 appetite for a cheaper, healthier alternative to olive oil. Rapeseed oil has the lowest saturated fat content of any edible oil \u2013 just 6% compared with 14% in olive oil and 51% in butter \u2013is rich in Omega 3 \u2013 which is good for blood circulation and young brains \u2013 and contains Omega 6 and 9.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s biggest brand is Farrington\u2019s Mellow Yellow, which Nigella Lawson described in her cookbook Kitchen as her rapeseed oil of choice. More recently, the company was chosen to become a partner of Michel Roux Jr\u2019s London cookery school where the chefs have been using the oil since the enterprise opened in 2013.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a01d1a9b81db3ad20abf334db13975d8b80b7071\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431685770771/09648473-1bbb-4e7e-8ccc-b95a0759f686-460x301.jpeg\" alt=\"Production of Mellow Yellow rapeseed oil, Nigella Lawson\u2019s favourite, at Bottom Farm, Northamptonshire.\" width=\"460\" height=\"301\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Production of Mellow Yellow rapeseed oil, Nigella Lawson\u2019s favourite, at Bottom Farm, Northamptonshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rose/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Galton Blackiston, owner of the Michelin-starred Morston Hall restaurant in north Norfolk, said his kitchens now used 99% cold-pressed rapeseed oil because of its improved flavour, consistency and versatility.</p> <p>\u201cI was first introduced to rapeseed oil about 18 years ago when a lady came to the door of my hotel and asked me to taste it,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt was \u2018cabbagey\u2019 and unrefined. But the oil has improved in leaps and bounds through better production and filtering.\u201d</p> <p>For Morston Hall\u2019s menu, Blackiston has devised a lemon-flavoured rapeseed oil ice-cream, barbecued asparagus drizzled with rapeseed oil, and almond and orange cake in which rapeseed oil provides a low-saturated-fat substitute for butter. </p> <p>\u201cIt has a distinctive and subtle flavour that is earthy and nutty rather than fruity, and is fantastic for pan frying, deep frying and even baking.

      "bodyText": "It is a heart-warming sight that deserves to be bottled. On a sunny May morning in east Suffolk as far as the eye can see, the flat but gently rolling fields are a vibrant shade of yellow. Bees and butterflies are flitting around the blooming rape flowers which will gradually die off, leaving the seedpods to be harvested in July and August. This scene of expanding fields of gold is being replicated across the UK as farmers turn more of their land over to growing rapeseed. Retail experts report it is now the fastest growing vegetable oil in the UK, with supermarkets expanding their ranges to meet shoppers\u2019 appetite for a cheaper, healthier alternative to olive oil. Rapeseed oil has the lowest saturated fat content of any edible oil \u2013 just 6% compared with 14% in olive oil and 51% in butter \u2013is rich in Omega 3 \u2013 which is good for blood circulation and young brains \u2013 and contains Omega 6 and 9. The UK\u2019s biggest brand is Farrington\u2019s Mellow Yellow, which Nigella Lawson described in her cookbook Kitchen as her rapeseed oil of choice. More recently, the company was chosen to become a partner of Michel Roux Jr\u2019s London cookery school where the chefs have been using the oil since the enterprise opened in 2013. Galton Blackiston, owner of the Michelin-starred Morston Hall restaurant in north Norfolk, said his kitchens now used 99% cold-pressed rapeseed oil because of its improved flavour, consistency and versatility. \u201cI was first introduced to rapeseed oil about 18 years ago when a lady came to the door of my hotel and asked me to taste it,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt was \u2018cabbagey\u2019 and unrefined. But the oil has improved in leaps and bounds through better production and filtering.\u201d For Morston Hall\u2019s menu, Blackiston has devised a lemon-flavoured rapeseed oil ice-cream, barbecued asparagus drizzled with rapeseed oil, and almond and orange cake in which rapeseed oil provides a low-saturated-fat substitute for butter. \u201cIt has a distinctive and subtle flavour that is earthy and nutty rather than fruity, and is fantastic for pan frying, deep frying and even baking. Importantly, I love using it because I know where it comes from,\u201d Blackiston said.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u2018Doing more with less\u201d: that was how Bank of England governor Mark Carney described productivity growth, at his quarterly press briefing last Wednesday. It\u2019s not as controversial as migration, or as politically explosive as the prospect of Brexit, but Carney made it clear that he believes Britain\u2019s productivity record will be the key to sustaining our economic recovery. \u201cIn the medium term, productivity growth \u2013 doing more with less \u2013 is the key determinant of income growth. Our shared prosperity depends on it.\u201d So far, as the monetary policy committee\u2019s analysis made clear, the recovery has been underpinned by a rapid growth in the size of Britain\u2019s workforce \u2013 through increased net migration, the growing number of over-65s still in employment and the extra hours many existing employees have been willing to work. But the availability of this reserve army of workers has helped to keep growth in pay \u2013 and living standards \u2013 weak. Pay levels do now seem to be to picking up: labour market data published last week showed that average weekly wages in March were 3.3% higher than a year ago, which is almost twice the 1.7% growth rate seen in the same month last year. For workers, that should mean the benefits of recovery are finally starting to be felt, easing the long-term squeeze on living standards. But the wage recovery will only be sustainable \u2013 which means affordable for Britain\u2019s businesses \u2013 if it is reflected in rising productivity; and as yet this has failed to materialise. The MPC has repeatedly forecast an improvement in productivity growth over the past five years; each time its hopes have been dashed. In Wednesday\u2019s inflation report, the committee offered three possible explanations. First, the growing proportion of lower-skilled employees in the workforce has been bad for output per hour, as these workers tend to be less productive. Second, rock-bottom interest rates, and \u201cforbearance\u201d by lenders reluctant to crystallise their losses by calling in loans may have allowed inefficient businesses to survive when it might have been better \u2013 for the country\u2019s productivity record at least \u2013 if they had been swept away by the crisis. Third, chronically weak business investment is likely to have slowed technological progress, and made firms less productive. Whizzy new kit can allow the same workforce to produce more output. The Bank now believes that as demand continues to pick up, these factors will prove to be transitory: firms will start hiring higher-skilled workers \u2013 and retraining their existing ones. Investors will back the most promising and innovative new ventures, instead of propping up zombie companies. And this rising business investment will deliver innovation. George Osborne believes he can help, too. He has long been keen on Thatcher-style \u201csupply-side\u201d reforms, aimed at boosting the economy\u2019s potential growth rate. The \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, which will include devolving economic decision-making to cities and improving transport links, is partly conceived as a bid to improve productivity. Planning reforms and increased investment in apprenticeships are in the same category; a rapid decision on runway expansion following the report from the Davies commission could also help. Many of these measures should be welcomed, but they won\u2019t fix our productivity problems overnight. And some economists believe other factors, including the hangover of debt from the crisis years, may also be at work. Meanwhile, in the short term, anxiety about the looming Brexit referendum, and a fresh round of austerity, could restrain business investment, bear down on demand, and hold back Britain\u2019s ability to \u201cdo more with less\u201d. Economists have struggled to explain our parlous productivity performance over the past five years, which means it\u2019s very hard to be confident that a turnaround is here at last. As Carney put it: \u201cAmong the many uncertainties we face, the timing and extent of any prospective pick-up in productivity growth remains our most difficult judgment.\u201d If living standards are to improve, we have to hope this time, finally, the Bank is right. Pay squeeze goes on Most company boards want to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d on pay and conditions for their workers, according to the amply remunerated Lord Rose, chairman of Ocado. If that\u2019s true, then they seem to be going about it in an unusual way. Only about a quarter of FTSE 100 companies have signed up to the living wage, a measure of the amount required for people to live with dignity, based on research by the respected Joseph Rowntree Foundation. The Guardian and Observer are in the process of applying to be accredited. Some of the UK\u2019s most respected companies are missing from that list, including all the major retailers. Sports Direct has been vilified for its treatment of staff, the majority of whom are on zero-hours contracts. But others are involved in practices which should make their boards blush. Next \u2013 a company led by a man compassionate enough to have handed his bonus over to staff more than once \u2013 is one of them. Ten staff at the retailer are holding out against its decision to scrap extra pay for Sunday working \u2013 a move that hit about 800 people. The company deems those numbers a measure of how happy staff are to accept new contracts. But more than one worker affected by the change described how they were persuaded to give up their extra pay: they were taken into a \u201cforced change\u201d meeting and told that if they did not accept the new conditions, they were effectively resigning. All have worked at Next for at least seven years. Campaigners say that many retailers are now ditching traditional benefits, such as extra evening or bank holiday pay, as companies try to reduce costs in the face of a still-tough consumer market. With no collective bargaining in companies such as Next, staff have little support. The costs and career risks of challenging the company at a tribunal mean few take that route. Low-wage activists will be touring annual shareholder meetings over the next few months asking companies to improve life for their lowest-paid workers. Those boards that want to show their customers they really care about their workers will be listening carefully. It is not just an issue for do-gooders. An estimated \u00a311bn of taxpayers\u2019 money goes towards \u201cin-work benefits\u201d to top up the wages of those on low pay. You don\u2019t need to be an economist to realise that doesn\u2019t add up any more. Get ready for another banking whinge On 8 July, George Osborne will deliver his first budget as chancellor of a government with a Conservative majority. That will be a month after Stuart Gulliver, the boss of HSBC, has presided over a \u201cstrategy day\u201d at which he has promised to spell out the criteria the bank will use for its decision on whether to move its headquarters outside London. Gulliver has already blamed Osborne\u2019s bank levy for making his life difficult. He argues the levy makes it harder for him to fulfil his promise to keep increasing the dividend to shareholders \u2013 and he will be able to deliver a new whinge just a few weeks before Osborne sets out his new budget. In his last one, Osborne raised the levy for the ninth time. In his next one, he must resist any pressure from HSBC \u2013 or Standard Chartered for that matter \u2013 for a reduction or a rethink.",

      "bodyText": "As fans of Postman Pat know well, usurping a regular postie and delivering letters to people\u2019s homes is trickier than it looks. This was a lesson learned repeatedly during series two of the children\u2019s animated television show \u2013 especially episodes 26 and 27, where first Pat\u2019s wife Sara tried to do his round for him, and then the rabid capitalists of Greendale attempted to modernise the workplace and send out a robot instead. Spoiler alert: Pat returned to work in episode 28. Anyway, it is also a lesson now learned by upstart operators who supposedly fancied cherry-picking Royal Mail\u2019s more lucrative markets by delivering mail to our doors. Last week, Royal Mail\u2019s only real rival in this market, the ridiculously named Whistl, effectively abandoned plans to deliver to doorsteps after it couldn\u2019t find anybody to fund its service. The announcement was terrible news for 2,000 or so Whistl employees now facing the axe but, conversely, rather welcome for Royal Mail workers worried about their jobs, and for the firm\u2019s owners, with the shares shooting up by 3.9%. It was also nicely timed for the postal service\u2019s annual meeting this week, although it all comes too late for Pat: he was dropped from Royal Mail marketing campaigns in 2000, as he no longer fitted its \u201ccorporate image\u201d. Extra-curricular activities If you are the type who employs a City broker, and have sometimes wondered exactly how hard they\u2019re grafting on your behalf for those chunky fees, here\u2019s a fun game to play. Give them a call to see if they\u2019re in the office this week. Repeat the exercise on 5 June, any time between 16 and 20 June, then again for a couple of weeks from the end of June. The chances are you might keep missing your broker, who will be extremely busy having meetings with other clients, none of whom could make it into the City. In case you\u2019re curious, those meetings will probably be taking place this week at the Chelsea Flower Show, the Lord\u2019s Test match and (possibly) Wentworth, where the PGA golf is teeing off. Your broker will then be dragged over to Epsom for the Investec Oaks on 5 June, followed by Royal Ascot (16-20 June) and Wimbledon (29 June-12 July) \u2013 which should have ensured that everybody is in peak bubbly-quaffing form to return to St John\u2019s Wood for more crucial negotiations, which will need to take place during the Ashes Test in the middle of July. Life is grand, isn\u2019t it? Frozen in In the peerless 1983 comedy film Trading Places, Eddie Murphy\u2019s character, loudmouthed down-and-out Billy Ray Valentine, is banged up in a police cell after being accused of attempted robbery. An officer suddenly arrives and tells him: \u201cMove it: you made bail,\u201d to which a startled Valentine replies: \u201cI did?\u201d This seems like the polar opposite to the situation of Navinder Singh Sarao, the British trader fighting extradition to the US after being arrested last month for allegedly spoofing financial markets and supposedly contributing to the 2010 \u201cflash crash\u201d. Unlike Valentine, he seems to be incredibly rich and discreet, having allegedly made \u00a327m but still being the sort who waits for a supermarket to mark down its sandwiches before buying lunch. So you can imagine that when Singh was told he hadn\u2019t made bail, he might have responded: \u201cI didn\u2019t?\u201d \u2013 seeing as he thought he had \u00a35m in a trading account for that purpose. But it transpired that those monies, along with all the rest of Sarao\u2019s funds, have been frozen by the US authorities, making it an offence to touch them. Lawyers explained this to the magistrate, to no avail, meaning Sarao\u2019s been in custody for almost four weeks. He goes to the high court this week to get the conditions altered.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Abbott has signalled his intention to press ahead with a parliamentary inquiry into the price of iron ore but has stressed that his government isn\u2019t one \u201cthat interferes with free markets\u201d. Mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto have been accused of flooding the market with iron ore, thus lowering its price, in order to hurt smaller rivals. Iron ore is Australia\u2019s largest commodity export but its price per tonne has dropped dramatically from $120 just two years ago. The government\u2019s latest budget bases its forecasts of iron ore at $48 a tonne. Andrew Forrest, the billionaire founder and chairman of the Fortescue Metals Group, has said the drop in the iron ore price is due to \u201cthe nauseatingly repetitive statements made by these two companies that they are going to flood the market with iron ore, that they are going to be the last man standing and that their friendly competitors are going to disappear\u201d. Abbott told journalists in Perth on Sunday that it is \u201cimportant that we get to the facts\u201d over the drop in iron ore prices. \u201cThere are all sorts of claim claims floating around, the important thing is that we have a dynamic, productive, creative iron ore industry for the future,\u201d he said. \u201cIron ore is incredible important commodity for this country and for the wider world, so we want to ensure that the market is operating as it should.\u201d The prime minister said that he doesn\u2019t see any \u201cheroes and villains\u201d in the dispute and rejected the suggestion that the big miners may think the government is interfering in the free market. \u201cThis is not a government that interferes with free markets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe iron ore market has never been subsidised or supported by government. We aren\u2019t in the business of holding them back, we\u2019re not in the business of holding their hands. This government will never do that.\u201d The Minerals Council of Australia has ridiculed Forrest\u2019s claims over BHP and Rio\u2019s activities and any inquiry would highlight the \u201cdangers of interventions in favour of selected producers\u201d. Rod Sims, chairman of the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission, has warned against cartel-like behaviour among iron ore producers but has said the accusations against BHP and Rio are \u201cmisguided.\u201d The treasurer, Joe Hockey, said no final decision on an inquiry had been made, but denied that Sims has had the final say in the matter. \u201cRod Sims is an independent umpire, he has had a look at that but obviously the parliament is able to look at issues as it sees fit,\u201d Hockey told ABC\u2019s Insiders program. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should in any way stop the parliament from looking at a range of different issues, do you?\u201d Hockey added that any inquiry, which will reportedly be headed by Liberal MP Angus Taylor, would not be aimed at BHP or Rio. \u201cThey are huge taxpayers, enormous contributors to Australia and big employers and we are not anti-Australian,\u201d Hockey said. \u201cRemember Kevin Rudd said they were big multinationals. Frankly, they\u2019re great Australian companies and Australian-based companies in many ways making a massive contribution to the nation.\u201d",
