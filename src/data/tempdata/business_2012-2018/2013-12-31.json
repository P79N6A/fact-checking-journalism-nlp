      "bodyText": "Shares in Debenhams dived more than 12% , knocking \u00a3125m off the value of the department store group, after it warned that first-half profits had been hit by unprecedented high street discounting in the runup to Christmas. In its second profits warning in less than a year, the department store group said it expected to make a pre-tax profit of \u00a385m in the first six months of its financial year, 26% less than last year, after hopes were dashed for a late surge in sales in the week before 28 December. Analysts now expect Debenhams' profits to come in around 20% below forecasts, which had already been cut before Christmas when it emerged that trading was not going well. Its house broker, Oriel, reduced its expectations for the full year by 13% to \u00a3135m on 18 December but the company is now expected to make just \u00a3115m for that period. Michael Sharp, the chief executive, said: \"The market was highly promotional in the runup to Christmas and we responded to these conditions to ensure our offer was competitive. However, this extremely difficult environment has inevitably had an impact on both our sales and profitability.\" Sharp was also gloomy about the outlook for 2014. \"I think there is nothing on the horizon to give us any confidence that consumer sentiment is going to improve. When you talk to customers clearly they have less disposable income. Although they can see positive news about the economy, the reality is it doesn't feel any better,\" he said. The company also said the disappointment on profits meant it would be halting its share buyback programme, after buying about \u00a340m of shares last year. Debenhams' profits warning is the first concrete sign of a tough festive season for clothing retailers which have been hit by a combination of relatively mild weather, pressure on household incomes and competition from this year's expensive must-have electronic gadgets such as tablet computers and gaming consoles. Shares in rivals Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury's and Next were hit by worries that Debenhams was not the only clothing retailer to suffer. M&amp;S was the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 on Tuesday, down 2.3% to 432p on fears that its profit margins had also taken a hit from a week of discounting on its top selling knitwear and other clothing in the runup to Christmas. There were also signs that M&amp;S had lost some of its share of the women's clothing market in the 24 weeks to 13 November compared with the same period a year before, according to market analysts Kantar. In contrast, Next, Primark and New Look all gained share in the year according to the data, as did Debenhams. However, Debenhams' profit warning showed it paid a heavy price for keeping sales moving. Next, which will report on its Christmas trading performance on Friday, held off from offering any discounts until Boxing Day. \"The mid-market struggled, that was pretty obvious from the discounting in the high street pre-Christmas and not all of it looked pre-planned,\" said Kate Calvert, an analyst at Investec. \"There will be a slight miss on sales but the bigger hit will be on gross margins.\" At Debenhams, underlying sales rose by 0.1% in the 17 weeks to 28 December, despite a 27% rise in sales online. The figure suggests sales in stores open more than a year fell back. But the biggest obstacle to profits came from a higher level of discounting as the retailer struggled to attract shoppers \u2013 cutting gross profit margins by up to 1%. The latest problems at Debenhams will pile pressure on its finance director, Simon Herrick, who was already seen as likely to exit the company after a series of nasty surprises for investors on profits. He was also the author of a widely criticised letter to suppliers in which he demanded a discount days before Christmas. Sharp would not comment on Herrick. Asked if he was under pressure himself, Sharp said: \"What we've witnessed here is a tough trading season, not a challenge to our credibility or strategy.\" Sharp blamed Debenhams' troubles on issues affecting the entire high street rather than its own mistakes. \"The high street stores were a sea of red before Christmas and clothing has been the problem because of unseasonal weather,\" he said, adding that shops clearly had lots of coats and knitwear to clear after Christmas.",

Endorsing attempts by Jenkins to clean up Barclays following the bank's \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor rates 18 months ago, Welby lambasted other unidentified bankers for refusing to acknowledge the need for changes to their culture and pay packets in the wake of the 2008 banking crisis. \"I don't want to name names but I came across some people recently \u2013 senior members of the City from foreign organisations \u2013 who were very clearly still absolutely in denial about what happened in 2008,\" Welby said.

Herbalife, which was rashly chosen as a short sell \u2013 in the hope of profiting from a falling price. In the event it gained ground, as accusations that it was a pyramid scheme \u2013 denied by the slimming powder company \u2013 failed to stick. In the calculations, this is shown as a 165% loss. My own choice, Chemring, dropped 2%.

The latest data from the Land Registry underscore regional differences, says my colleague<strong> Rupert Jones</strong>.</p> <p>He writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>The widening north-south divide in the housing market is laid bare by new official figures showing that average prices are up 10% in London over the last year but down by as much at 10% in parts of north-east England such as Hartlepool.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/67805/HPIReport20131223_Final.pdf\">November data issued by the Land Registry (pdf)</a>, the average house price in England and Wales now stands at \u00a3165,411 \u2013 some 3.2% higher than a year earlier. However, these figures disguise wide regional variations.</p> <p>Of the 10 regions, London saw the largest annual price rise \u2013 10.6% \u2013 which lifted the typical price-tag to \u00a3396,646. That is more than four times the typical cost of a home in the north-east, which was the only region where prices were down (by 1.6%) on an annual basis. There, the average home costs \u00a396,227.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Full story: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/31/november-house-prices-london-rise\">November house prices highlight wide regional differences</a></h2> <p><strong>Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight</strong> has been looking at what the numbers - and other surveys - mean for those fearing a housing market bubble is building in the UK. He comments:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the face of it, an increase of just 0.1% month-on-month in house prices in November reported by the Land Registry suggests that concerns of a developing housing market bubble are overdone, at this stage at least. Even an annual increase of 3.2% in November hardly points to house prices roaring ahead.</p> <p>However, it should be borne in mind that the Land Registry provides lagging evidence on house prices as its index is based on completed house transactions. Furthermore, most surveys are consistently reporting&#xa0;markedly strengthening house prices with the gains becoming more widespread. In particular, latest data from the Halifax puts house price growth at 1.1% month-on-month in November and a 6-year high of 7.7% year-on-year in the three months to November, while the Nationwide puts house price growth at 0.6% month-on-month and a 40-month high of 6.5% year-on-year in November.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-31T13:05:42.427Z\">at 1.05pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52c2ba0fe4b053cde70cfb94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-31T12:35:37.398Z\">12.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bad year for Bankia</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCWorld/statuses/417995416475402240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Worst performing stock in Europe this year?

Thanks for all the comments and for reading. GW &amp; KA At midnight an 18th member joins the eurozone. Latvia is ditching its lats currency for the euro, with it taking the number of Europeans using the single currency to 333 million. Graeme Wearden has been looking at the move and what the year ahead holds for the eurozone. He writes: The eurozone will gain an extra member at midnight on Tuesday as Latvia becomes the 18th country to join the single currency union, despite little obvious public enthusiasm for the move. Latvia's arrival gives eurocrats in Brussels an extra reason to toast in the new year. Eighteen months after the threat of Greece quitting the euro gripped financial markets, the eurozone is marking its 15th anniversary by expanding, not fracturing. With final preparations completed, outgoing prime minister Valdis Dombrovskis will ceremonially withdraw the first euro note from an ATM shortly after midnight. European commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso offered his \"sincere congratulations\" to Latvia on Tuesday as households and businesses prepared to wave goodbye to their currency, the lats. Full story: Latvia joins eurozone at midnight despite little public enthusiasm For a quick look at how Latvia compares to its neighbours, the The Latvian Institute has made this infographic. Click here to explore. And finally, I have compiled a few facts about the eurozone's newest member Latvia for beginners Latvia has a coastline along the Baltic Sea and borders with Estonia, Russia, Belarus and Lithuania. The capital is Riga, where more than a third of the population lives. Some 44% of the country is forest. Latvia has a population of 2,041,763 and after it joins the eurozone 333 million Europeans will share the same currency Latvia's old currency, the lats (LVL), can be exchanged as of 1 January at an official conversion rate of 1 euro = 0.702804 LVL.

GDP growth in third quarter: 1.2% on the quarter (eurozone: 0.1%, EU: 0.2%, UK:0.8%) GDP per capita, expressed in purchasing power standards is 36% below the EU average, putting Latvia ahead of Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria but below the rest of the EU.

But it comes against the backdrop of Greek antipathy towards Germany and mounting hostility towards the EU more generally, according to our correspondent Helena Smith in Athens. She writes: Greece's assumption of the role \u2013 which comes with the ability to regulate policy in the 28-nation bloc \u2013 marks a major milestone for a state whose continued EU membership appeared far from assured a year ago. Even now, four years after triggering the debt drama that would become Europe's worst crisis since the second world war, there is scepticism over whether Athens will last the course. Monday's pre-dawn drive-by shooting attack at the home of Germany's ambassador to Greece underlined the volatile mood. The bullet casings found at the scene embodied the sentiments of a nation that blames Berlin for years of grinding austerity \u2013 the price of receiving more than \u20ac240bn (\u00a3200bn) in emergency loans from the EU and IMF. The fear of social unrest is never far away. None of this is lost on Greece's deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Evangelos Venizelos, who was quick to describe the shooting as an \"attempt to tarnish Greece's image\" before the EU presidency. Full story: Greece assumes EU presidency as anger towards Brussels grows The Guardian's share tips for 2014 are in and include a broad range of stocks from the UK and the US too, including big names like Vodafone and Lloyds Banking Group as well as some lesser known stocks. Our market reporter Nick Fletcher takes a look at how last year's tips fared and says the Guardian's business team managed a \"credible\" performance with an average 11.8% gain over 2014. He writes: Asos, chosen by Terry Macalister, was the star performer, while also worthy of mention were Betfair and Home Retail Group. However there was one choice in particular which let us down. Herbalife, which was rashly chosen as a short sell \u2013 in the hope of profiting from a falling price. In the event it gained ground, as accusations that it was a pyramid scheme \u2013 denied by the slimming powder company \u2013 failed to stick. In the calculations, this is shown as a 165% loss. My own choice, Chemring, dropped 2%. It started brightly but October's US government shutdown hit its defence orders while it also ran into production problems. Full story and all the tips for 2014 Remember that big stake that UK taxpayers own in Royal Bank of Scotland? Well, the losses on it are not pretty. My colleague Jill Treanor has been doing the maths as 2013 comes to a close. She also highlights an announcement revealing a package of shares worth \u00a31.5m for new chief executive, Ross McEwan. She writes: Taxpayers end 2013 with a \u00a314.5bn loss from their stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, five years after the Edinburgh-based bank received a record-breaking government bailout. While shares in the bank are languishing below the 502p average price at which 82% taxpayers' stake was bought, there is a \u00a31bn profit \u2013 on paper at least \u2013 for their share in Lloyds Banking Group at the end of 2013. Full story: RBS leaves taxpayers \u00a314.5bn out of pocket five years on from bailout You can see how the latest losses compare with previous years in the stories here: 2012: Bank bailout loses taxpayers \u00a323bn 2011: Taxpayers' loss in RBS and Lloyds bank stakes stands at \u00a340bn 2010: Taxpayers lose \u00a312.8bn on RBS and Lloyds 2009: Taxpayers make \u00a326bn loss on stakes in Lloyds Banking Group and RBS Stock markets in the US are on course for a positive finish to the year. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.1% at 1843, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.2% at 16537 and the Nasdaq is up 0.3% at 4165. The S&amp;P 500 is on track for its best year since 1997 and the Dow Jones is on course for the best year since 1996. In the UK, as reported earlier, the FTSE 100 gained more than 14% over 2013 in its best year since 2009. Elsewhere in Europe, the annual gains were also the highest in several years. Reuters has the details: European shares rose on Tuesday to mark a positive end to 2013, with pan-European indexes posting their best annual gains since 2009 and many investors forecasting more progress next year. Although the stock market rally still faces risks from factors such as a possible spike in bond yields or a rise in the oil price from civil unrest in the Middle East and Africa, traders expect the gradual recovery in the world economy to continue to support equities in 2014. Trading volumes were low on Tuesday as many European markets including Germany, Italy and Switzerland had already closed. France's CAC-40 equity index closed up 0.5 percent at 4,295.95 points, bringing its gains for 2013 to 18 percent while Spain's IBEX rose 0.2 percent to 9,916.70 points, with the IBEX up around 21 percent since the start of 2013. Full story: European shares record best year since 2009 My colleague Simon Goodley suggests Barclays boss Antony Jenkins used his guest editing slot on BBC radio this morning to introduce a plug from the Lord himself \u2013 or at least one of his representatives on earth in the form of Justin Welby. He writes: It has become something of a Christmas tradition to criticise the BBC for airing repeats, but rarely does it get slammed for broadcasting commercials. Yet on Tuesday morning, Radio Four somehow managed both. The stage was the Today programme which, this week, is being guest-edited by various notables. Tuesday was the turn of the Barclays boss, Antony Jenkins, who modestly chose a story about himself to feature in the show's initial news run. Full story: Barclays manages to win endorsement from archbishop of Canterbury Should you have missed him earlier this morning, Jenkins' stint as guest editor on BBC Radio 4's Today programme is now available online. While you are listening why not vote in our poll? Poll: Was the BBC right to hand over the Today programme to Barclays boss? Spot gold has just hit a six-month low of $1,184.5 per ounce. The 1% loss today caps a poor year for gold and it is on track for its biggest annual loss in 32 years. Other commodities have fallen too this year as investors look to riskier assets. The London Stock Exchange also points out the FTSE 100 turns 30 next month and gives us a little trip down memory lane. The index of bluechip London-listed shares launched on 3 January 1984 and among its original constituents were Allied-Lyons, ICI, Cadbury Schweppes, Guest Keen &amp; Nettlefolds, Ferranti, Fisons, Trusthouse Forte, Midland Bank, Rowntree Mackintosh and THORN EMI. Of the original 100 stocks, 30 are still FTSE constituents. The include Associated British Foods, British American Tobacco, Barclays, GlaxoSmithKline, Marks &amp; Spencer, Pearson, J Sainsbury, Tesco, Royal Dutch Shell and Whitbread. The LSE says the current combined market capitalisation of the FTSE 100 constituents is \u00a31.87trn while in December 1985, the market capitalisation was \u00a3164bn, the first available data. The peak for the FTSE 100 was 6950.6 on 30 December 1999. The largest annual rise was in 1997, when the index rose 24.69% over the course of the year. The largest annual fall was in 2008, when the index fell -31.33% over the course of the year. Greece's stock exchange has also closed, after a strong rally this year as the threat of Grexit receded. The FTSE 100 began this year strongly, before a springtime wobble wiped out those gains. Most of the second half of 2013 was dominated by speculation about when the US Federal Reserve would begin to slow its bond buying programme. That decision finally came earlier this month, sparking a late rally. The FTSE 100's strongest annual gains since 2009 are echoed by a strong year on the wider FTSE 250 midcap index. The London Stock Exchange sends through these end of year numbers: As at 31 December 2013, FTSE 250 was at 15935.35 which is an end of day all-time high. It is up 28.77% over the course of the year. As at 31 December 2013, FTSE 100 was at 6749.09, which is up 851.28 basis points on 2012 value of 5897.81 (on 31/12/2012). This represents an increase of 14.43%. The biggest annual points increase for the FTSE 100 since 2009, when the index rose 978.71 basis points over the year, an increase of 22.07%. The highest end of day FTSE 100 close in 2013 was 6777.70 on 30 October. Hardly a day goes by in the UK without new house price numers and why should New Year's Eve be any different? The latest data from the Land Registry underscore regional differences, says my colleague Rupert Jones. He writes: The widening north-south divide in the housing market is laid bare by new official figures showing that average prices are up 10% in London over the last year but down by as much at 10% in parts of north-east England such as Hartlepool. According to the November data issued by the Land Registry (pdf), the average house price in England and Wales now stands at \u00a3165,411 \u2013 some 3.2% higher than a year earlier. However, these figures disguise wide regional variations. Of the 10 regions, London saw the largest annual price rise \u2013 10.6% \u2013 which lifted the typical price-tag to \u00a3396,646. That is more than four times the typical cost of a home in the north-east, which was the only region where prices were down (by 1.6%) on an annual basis. There, the average home costs \u00a396,227. Full story: November house prices highlight wide regional differences Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight has been looking at what the numbers - and other surveys - mean for those fearing a housing market bubble is building in the UK. He comments: On the face of it, an increase of just 0.1% month-on-month in house prices in November reported by the Land Registry suggests that concerns of a developing housing market bubble are overdone, at this stage at least. Even an annual increase of 3.2% in November hardly points to house prices roaring ahead. However, it should be borne in mind that the Land Registry provides lagging evidence on house prices as its index is based on completed house transactions. Furthermore, most surveys are consistently reporting markedly strengthening house prices with the gains becoming more widespread. In particular, latest data from the Halifax puts house price growth at 1.1% month-on-month in November and a 6-year high of 7.7% year-on-year in the three months to November, while the Nationwide puts house price growth at 0.6% month-on-month and a 40-month high of 6.5% year-on-year in November. The FTSE 100 has closed for the year after a shorter trading day and the gains for the year are 14.4%, marking the best performance since 2009 - as widely expected. The bluechip index's provisional closing level is 6,746.4, meaning it has only just ended the year with a daily gain - it is up 0.2% on Monday's close. Islington North MP Jeremy Corbyn has been in touch about our poll: Was the BBC right to hand over the Today programme to Barclays boss? So far the poll stands at NO 70% and YES 30% The Labour MP tweets: Our retail specialist Sarah Butler has been looking at that gloomy Debenhams trading statement from earlier this morning and says it brings bad news for rival clothes retailers too. She writes: Debenhams' second profits warning in less than a year is the first sign of a tough festive season for clothing retailers who have been hit by a combination of relatively mild weather, pressure on household incomes and competition from this year's expensive must-have electronic gadgets such as tablet computers and gaming consoles. Shares in rival retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury's and Next were also hit by worries that other clothing retailers had also suffered. \"The mid-market struggled, that was pretty obvious from the discounting in the high street pre-Christmas and not all of it looked pre-planned,\" said Kate Calvert, an analyst at Investec. \"There will be a slight miss on sales but the bigger hit will be on gross margins.\" Full story: Debenhams shares dive as poor Christmas prompts profit warning My colleague Angela Monaghan has been looking into this morning's update on the Church of England's stake in payday lender Wonga - an investment it has failed to sell off. She writes: The Church of England still owns an \u00a380,000 stake in Wonga, despite the Archbishop of Canterbury's criticism of the payday lender in the summer. Justin Welby was forced to admit on BBC Radio 4 that the C of E had failed to sell off its indirect investment in the company, which came to light in July a day after he questioned Wonga's ethics and vowed to bring it down. Welby told the Today programme the C of E had completed a review of its investment and was \"working out\" how to dispose of the stake responsibly, without making a loss for pensioners. Full story: Church of England still owns \u00a380,000 Wonga stake, Justin Welby admits Was the BBC right to hand over the Today programme to Barclays boss? You can vote now in our poll. The tradition of guest editors in the last week of the year is often unpopular with some listeners \u2013 giving Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins control of the show sparked a Twitter backlash. Let us know what you think in the poll. The Debenhams forecast for pre-tax profits in the first half of around \u00a385m is well below analysts' forecast for \u00a3112m, according to Reuters data. It would mark a 26% fall from profits made a year earlier. The shares are now down 12% at 73.4p. Elsewhere in the retail sector, Marks &amp; Spencer shares are down 1.5% at 436p and Next is down 0.6% at \u00a354.20. Shares in Debenhams are down almost 11% now at 74.4p - they started the year at 114p. Some reactions from Twitter: An extract from the Debehmans trading statement, available here in full: As widely documented, the retail sector as a whole has been highly competitive with an unprecedented level of promotional activity. This is largely due to declining high street footfall, as evidenced by the BRC/Springboard Footfall Monitor, continued pressure on household incomes and the impact of unseasonal weather on clothing and clothing-related sales. Against strong comparators from last year, we delivered Group gross transaction value growth of 0.7% and Group like-for-like sales growth of 0.1%. The better performing categories were beauty, home and gifting whilst clothing was weaker. Online sales continued to grow, increasing by 27.0% for the 17 week period and accounting for 15.6% of total sales compared with 12.4% for the same period last year. However, online delivery income was lower than anticipated. The company also says: \u2022 Gross margin declined \u2022 It did not experience the anticipated final surge in sales in the last week of the period and as a result expects the need for more markdowns to clear stock in January and February \u2022 Now expects pre-tax profit for the first half to be in the region of \u00a385m, compared with \u00a3114.7m in the first half of 2013 Chief executive Michael Sharp comments: \"As has been widely commented on in the media, the market was highly promotional in the run up to Christmas and we responded to these conditions to ensure our offer was competitive. However, this extremely difficult environment has inevitably had an impact on both our sales and profitability. \"Looking forward, I expect conditions to remain highly competitive as we enter 2014. Everyone in the organisation is focused on improving performance and growing the business, building on the four pillars of our strategy which I remain confident will lead to success over the longer term.\" Breaking: Debenhams has just put out a trading statement that makes worrying reading for all retailers. The department stores chain's shares are down 9.5%, or 8p, at 75.3p, after it highlighted \"competitive\" conditions that will persist in 2014. It reports like-for-like sales growth of just 0.1%. More details in a moment... So... what did we learn from the last three hours? \u2022 Barclays boss Antony Jenkins has nailed his leadership colours to the mast. Now he has to deliver. I lost count of the number of times leadership was mentioned during the Today programme (and that's not just because of the early start). Once you ally yourself with parish leaders and school teachers, not to mention nuns running AIDS charities, you've set the bar pretty high. Any future scandals on Jenkins' watch and critics will throw his bold talk of ethics and better business back in his face. \u2022 Fixing Barclays, and the rest of banking, will take years. Jenkins has indicated before that the clean-up job at Barclays will be a lengthy process, and the events of 2013 clearly haven't changed his mind. As he told London students: Trust is a very easy thing to lose, and a very hard thing to win back. In my view it will takes several years - probably five to ten - to rebuild trust in Barclays. \u2022 The Archbishop hasn't stopped criticising the City. Justin Welby used the Thought For The Day slot to preach the message of Hope -- but was pretty uncompromising later in the programme when he pointed to the 30 years of decline in British banking. He did credit Jenkins with trying to reverse the tide -- but didn't sound too convinced that the industry had changed, particularly when he cited those bankers who are still in 'denial'. John Kay's early morning comments about the industry's failings are also worth revisiting. \u2022 The Today programme should also cross its fingers that Jenkins lives up to his own promises. The tradition of guest-editors in the last week of the year is often unpopular with some listeners -- handing a top banker the keys to the show has guaranteed a backlash. Personally, I think it's worth giving Jenkins a fair hearing -- especially for the section where we heard the concerns of students in London. But I imagine Barclays are pretty chuffed about the amount of exposure their CEO has received this morning. Here's the full quote from Justin Welby about how some in the City are still in denial, via PA: I don't want to name names but I came across some people recently who were very clear - senior members of the City from foreign organisations - but who were very clearly still absolutely in denial about what happened in 2008. The show ended with Evan Davis giving Today's guest editor a mild going-over. He points out to Antony Jenkins that many comments on Twitter that today's show has been more PR than real progress. Jenkins concedes that listeners could be forgiven for thinking that the frequent talk about \"it's self-serving twaddle\". But it's not! (he says). And again insists that true leadership is vital to improving the world. It would have been easier not to take part, and to stay in my office, he adds. Reviewing the show, Jenkins cites the interview with South Africa's Trevor Manuel (see 6.57am) - arguing that the challenges identified in its 30-year plan would apply pretty well to the UK. Evan Davis suggests that Jenkins has been addressing his own staff as much as the wider group of Radio 4 listeners -- do the rest of Barclays really agree with his vision of a better-behaved bank? Jenkins says that his message is getting through. We've made huge progress in getting people to sign up, especially senior leaders. I spent a lot of last year making the case for change within Barclays, Jenkins adds. But what about the ongoing scandals, asks Davis? Some of these misdeeds have occurred recently -- Barclay's problems are hardly ancient history. Jenkins says it is \"Desperately disappointing\" that these issues are being uncovered. But he also reminds Davis of Archbishop Welby's remarks that today's bankers are tackling 30 years of problems. The leadership challenge is to get on and tackle them, not say the job's too hard. Summary to follow... Just to clarify -- Justin Welby's comments about some financiers refusing to face the reality of the 2008 crisis appear to relate to a foreign banker (not former, as I misheard) Justin Welby's decision to endorse Pope Francis as Time's Person of the Year has caught the eye: Scanning twitter, the hashtag #r4today (used to communicate with the Today team), is broadly critical of the decision to give Antony Jenkins control of the programme today (as have many of the comments below).... Justin Welby reveals that he has met a high-flying banker who still had their head in the sand over the causes of the biggest financial crisis in decades. Asked whether banks could actually regain trust, the Archbishop says that today's bosses are trying to clean up decades of harm: People like Antony are dealing with 30 years in which there was strong pressure to go in one direction... maximising shareholder return... and a progressive loss of vision of what banks were for. (updated quote via PA) Welby argues that economies don't exist for themselves, they exist for \"the common good\", for human beings. Fixing today's problems is a \"massive, massive challenge\" and it will take time. He gives Jenkins a modest blessing, saying that Barclays and other major bankers are working very hard. However, he adds that he recently had a meeting with a banker who was \"still in denial about 2008\". It's a private meeting, though, so he won't reveal the name . Antony Jenkins pops up again to bang the leadership drum -- and positioning himself on the same side as the Archbishop. If you have good leadership, in a church or a school or a business, you get success, the Barclays CEO argues. And in a defence of his own sector, he argues that without vibrant banks you can't get a vibrant economy - and without that you can't have a fair, growing and stable society. Any progress on the Church of England's stake in Wonga -- which caused Welby much embarrassment this year after he attacked pay-day lenders? The Archbishop says that the CofE's financial officers are working out how to sell the shares without incurring a loss. They've already had five months to sort this out -- clearly it's a tricky issue for the Church, caught between the moral case and the financial one. Justin Welby is back at the microphone -- a second chance to criticise bankers' pay and behaviour? Not immediately -- the Archbishop of Canterbury begins by fielding a question about the state of the Church of England. He denies that the CofE is in decline - saying there are signs of growth in many parishes. Do people see the church as better at politics than religion? Welby replies that he's \"really no idea\" -- but the Church need to focus on worship of God. We're better at religion than politics, he says. Does the church need to change in order to grow? Yes, Welby adds -- citing new theological programmes that have driven attendances up. It needs to be a focus on faith. And he pays tribute to Pope Francis's work on social justice, saying the Pope would be his Person of the Year (as Time Magazine has decided). He's extraordinary. Back on leadership, and nun Sister Mary Owens talks about her work in Nairobi. She runs a charity called Nyumbani, which cares for children who are infected and affected by HIV. Jenkins says Sister Mary is an example of the great work that people can achieve with so little resources. The prestigious ten past eight slot on Today is devoted to the deadlock in the Northern Ireland peace talks. Theresa Villiers, secretary of state for Northern Ireland, says it is \"obviously disappointing\" that these talks have not yet reached a final agreement, but adds that these are very complex issues. \"I don\u2019t think this is the end of the road\", she says -- indeed, it's important that it isn't. Evan Davis suggests that the situation might be different if Nelson Mandela was taking a role in the talks (a good reminder of what real leadership looks like). Villiers says that she's happy with the quality of leadership on display at the Haass talks -- her message to Northern Ireland is that it is important to mark the past, but also to make progress on sharing education, and boosting the economy. Our news story on the talks is here: Northern Ireland talks end in deadlock The talks covered a range of issues from Northern Ireland's history including unsolved murders from the Troubles, the route of loyalist parades and the flying of national flags \u2013 all matters that have repeatedly brought violence back to the surface of life in Northern Ireland despite the Good Friday Agreement that allowed the devolution of power to the assembly at Stormont. Here's our news story on Antony Jenkins' warning that it could take a decade to regain public trust after the scandals of recent years: Barclays boss admits it could take 10 years to rebuild public trust Antony Jenkins' claim that one needs to accept the salary levels in banking cost the Today programme at least one listener: (Jenkins is the Barclays CEO, of course, but the point stands...) Justin Welby threw his ecclesiastical weight behind the drive to clean up the City -- something Antony Jenkins has pledged today (but not, of course, delivered yet). Will banking \"revert to the bad old ways of the past\", or can it become a force for good, the Archbishop asks. The jury is out, of course, but Welby says he agrees with Jenkins that leadership is the issue. For actual change, you need: ...a vision based in justice and hope, so that everyone at every level is committed to change. Welby concludes by warning that the future is always tough and can be frightening, before wishing \"a happy and hopeful new year\" to all. Time for Thought for the Day -- with the Archbishop of Canterbury in the hot seat. Justin Welby does not take the chance to chastise Antony Jenkins -- season of goodwill and all that -- and instead makes 'Hope' the key theme. He begins by citing the terrorist attacks in the Russian city of Volgograd, and the violence in South Sudan, as major concerns as 2013 ends, before switching to economics. Is the UK economy rising like Lazarus, as some economists reckon, or do the debt levels mean we are heading into more troubled water? Whichever is right --the optimism or pessimism -- is one thing, hope is quite another, says Welby. Jenkins took a swing at the Shipping Forecast -- didn't do badly for a new boy, apparently, and then suggested a one-day job swap with the regular announcer. The key point in regaining trust, Jenkins adds, is that Barclays must be measured on \"what it does, not what it says\". And having taken control of Radio 4's flagship current affairs show, Jenkins has certainly had his say -- we need to now hold him to this bold talk of leadership and long-term planning in the years ahead. And now here's the question we flagged up earlier -- how can Jenkins regain trust in Barclays? He admits that it will be very long job, both for his bank and the rest. Trust is a very easy thing to lose, and a very hard thing to win back. In my view it will takes several years - probably five to ten - to rebuilt trust in Barclays. He adde that he hopes that what we do at Barclays can help rebuild confidence in the wider banking sector. Hasn't Barclays been implicated in tax evasion in the past? Jenkins responds that such actions are totally wrong. The huge pay levels in banking also concern the students in London -- why doesn't Barclays simply get rid of them and give the money to shareholders and customer? Jenkins suggests that \"if you want to be in a certain business\" you need to accept the pay that goes with it. If I'm in investment banking, I need to be prepared to accept the compensation that goes along with investment banking. For the record - Jenkins received a basic salary of \u00a31.1m in 2013 - with potential bonuses of several times as much. A student (apologies, they didn't all give their names), responds that top bankers are simply in it for the money. If you all stopped offering huge bonuses then people couldn't simply threaten to leave. \"You're exactly right, of course\", Jenkins replies -- before arguing that it simply wouldn't be legal for banks to conspire to keep pay low. An EXCELLENT question from one of the students in Clapton, who pulls Jenkins up about Barclays' own conduct. Raymond Edwards tells the bank boss that he has had personal experience of potential mis-selling: If your bank is now geared to customer service, how come when I went to open an account I was pressured to take out an overdraft that I didn\u2019t want? Jenkins suggests that the staffer may have thought they were \"doing you a favour\" by offering an overdraft that would come in handy one day (I really hope this isn't Barclay's official policy). Right -- it's time for Jenkins to face London students, through the Speakers for Schools programme (founded by Robert Peston). He met a group of A-level and BTEC business students at the BSix Sixth Form College in Clapton. Jenkins tells students they need to think about what changes they will make to the world in their lifetime. Lord Oakeshott, the Liberal Democrat peer (and major critic of the City) pins the blame for Barclay's damaged trust on Jenkins's predecessor, Bob Diamond -- who built up its investment banking arm before becoming CEO, only to fall on his sword after Barclays admitted some traders had rigged the Libor rate. City fund manager Helena Morrissey is fielding questions about what 'good businesses' actually means. She argues that firms who actually behave responsibly -- on issues like environmentalism, governance, and ethics, will actually deliver higher 'sustainable returns' over time. Simon Jack, the Today's business reporter, is sceptical - suggesting firms should focus on not mis-selling dodgy product and not abusing markets, rather than sponsoring the local football team ( ala Northern Rock) or fretting about picking up litter. More reaction -- showing the split between those who reckon Jenkins is on the right track.... ....and those who reckon it's impossible to steer banking back to public respect after the various scandals that have scarred the industry. Here's some reaction to Antony Jenkins's comments about the long-term challenge of regaining trust: The Today programme's actual editor, Jamie Angus, tweets a sneak preview of Justin Welby's Thought for the Day -- revealing that the Archbishop will focus on some of the most serious and worrying stories in the news today. We're also going to hear from Helena Morrissey, a big hitter in the City, shortly -- she's the CEO of Newton Investment Management. Heads-up: Antony Jenkins' grilling from London students, in which he admits regaining trust in Barclays will take years, will be broadcast at around 7.40am. Here's some highlights from the running order (online here): 0740: BBC Business editor Robert Peston and Antony Jenkins visit the Brooke House Sixth Form College in Clapton, East London, where Antony gave a lecture to students on what skills they needed for the future. 0742: Antony Jenkins meets the team that put together the shipping forecast, reads part of it himself, and talks to the people who use it. 0747: Thought for the day with The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. A reminder that you can hear the show here. One hour in, and Antony Jenkins has made Today's theme the importance of long-term thinking and planning, and proper leadership -- as he faces the 10-year challenge of regaining public trust. Wonder if Bob Diamond, who played a crucial role at Barclay's for many years before his 2012 resignation, is listening..... Responding to Trevor Manuel's comments on long-term thinking, Antony Jenkins argues that there's been a widespread erosion of trust across the UK in recent years. In banking, of course, but also in religious*, media and political institutions, he claims, adding; Trust is lost in weeks and months, and regained in years and decades. * - which reminds me that we'll be hearing from Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, later... Antony Jenkins (and BBC reporter Simon Jack) have met with South African politician Trevor Manuel to discuss the country's long-term National Development Plan. Manuel explains that the talks showed there was little difference between the main parties over the major long-term issues, making it possible to take big decisions in the national interest. It addresses \"fundamental issues\" such as how much debt to saddle the nation's young people with, says Manuel: If we only focus on the here and now, there is no thought of the future. Getting it right in practice, though, is more of an art than a science, he adds. Jack sounds unconvinced -- arguing that such planning only works in countries where one party dominates the political landscape. And how can leaders really predict the future with enough accuracy to make long-term plans? According to Manuel, though, it would be a dereliction of duty not to try... The main headline news on Today is that the latest Northern Ireland peace talks, chaired by former US diplomat Dr Richard Haass, have failed to reach a final deal. Responding to John Kay's indictment of banking, Antony Jenkins argues that a genuinely good business is a profitably one (apparently the most profitable Barclays branches are the ones with the most customer engagement). And Jenkins argues that the cure to a rotten culture is proper leadership from the top. Changing culture takes a long time, though. Another sign that Long-termism is one of Jenkins' big themes today, and at Barclays (especially as he admits it could take a decade to clean up its public image) Now British economist John Kay gives a damning assessment of the banking sector, for systematically destroying trust over the last two decades. He begins by remarking tersely that these days it's bankers, not religious leaders, who spend time assuring you that they're ethical -- after years in which the industry has acting anything but ethically. Kay pulled no punches, saying: Over the last 20 years banks have systematically destroyed their relationship with their customers. And how could they have avoided it? By treating customers respectfully, selling decent products, and firing those who didn't meet the highest standards. However, when an organisation is largely corrupt, Kay adds, with \"misaligned incentives at every level\", it's extremely hard to change. Are you optimistic that the situation will improve? Not very optimistic, Kay admits. Antony Jenkins takes his first turn at the microphone -- to argues that too much much attention to short-term factors like share prices. His point is not that short-term markets are bad, or inaccurate. \"They serve a very useful purpose\", but are prone to what he dubs \"lift, or elevator\" analysis (rather than detailed explanation of what's actually happening). When he steps down from Barclays, he plans to write a guide for new CEOs -- including a recommendation that they don't see their share price as the main measure of their success. Markets are a good tracker of sentiment, but not a measure of long-term sustainable return, he adds. News flash: Antony Jenkins has admitted that it could take a decade for Barclays to win back the public's trust. The Barclays boss has told students at Brooke House Sixth Form College in East London that he realises it will take a very long time to rebuild confidence, after the series of scandals (Libor, PPI, etc) that have rocked the sector. We get the full item later in Today, but they've played the key quote: Trust is a very easy thing to lose, and a very hard thing to win back. In my view it will takes several years - probably five to ten - to rebuilt trust in Barclays. The session was chaired by Robert Peston, the BBC's business editor, who has just written about it on his blog: In his chat with the students, to be broadcast in a special edition of the Today Programme this morning for which Jenkins is a guest editor, the Barclays chief executive said he was setting his bank a target of being more trusted than not by 2018. It is one of eight commitments Jenkins will make to staff, customers, shareholders and what he calls society in a few months. Mr Jenkins said that the bank would measure and monitor progress in a systematic way. Right now, Barclays - according to its own research - is more mistrusted than trusted, according to Mr Jenkins. Or to put it another way, on a trust scale of one to 10, its score is less than five (which is probably not a great surprise to you). Jenkins's target is for Barclays to be trusted to the tune of 6.5 out of 10 by 2018. That may not seem a particularly high mountain to climb, but it may well turn out to be more challenging than Everest, given that litigation and complaints against the banks show no sign of diminishing. Barclay's top PR man, Giles Croot, is tweeting photos from the studio: And we're off -- Today's being presented by Sarah Montague and Evan Davis. They say that Jenkins' stint will include a focus on bank pay --with Hackney students challenging the Barclays boss over the remuneration doled out to bankers. Antony Jenkins, who's been dubbed the \"nice man\" of British banking, took the top job at Barclays in August 2012, after the Libor scandal brought down his predecessor, Bob Diamond. Born and raised in Stoke-on-Trent, in what the media dub a \"working-class family\" (his father held down 2 jobs to pay the mortgage), Jenkins went to grammar school, then read PPE at Oxford. He joined Barclays after university, before a stint in the US with Citigroup. Unusually, he's not an investment banker -- Jenkins comes from the retail side; he's renown for emphasising the importance of the customer (that didn't stop Barclays being the most complained-about brand in Britain in 2011) And one of his first acts on becoming CEO was waiving his bonus, in the light of the Libor affair (in which financial traders conspired to fix the rate at which banks would lend to each other). Here's the official reason, from Jamie Angus, editor of Today: When we look for guest editors for Today, we are after people who have original and compelling ideas for the programme, and who can also give the audience some unusual insights into a world which otherwise might be hard for Today to reach.  OK, but what's in it for Jenkins (apart from the thrill of editing your own radio show)? In recent years Britain's banking sector has picked up more black marks than Santa after squeezing down a particularly sooty chimney. They include the Libor scandal (which swept Antony Jenkins to the top of Barclays); and the PPI misselling scandal, which incurred billions of pounds of compensation. By swapping the Barclays boardroom for a BBC studio, Antony Jenkins must hope to give the bank's reputation a polish. He also gets to promote issues close to his heart. They include leadership, the challenge of making long-term progress in a world fixated on short-termism, and technology. Good morning, and welcome to something a little different for the final Guardian business live blog of 2013. Every year around this time, a diverse bunch of the powerful, the influential and the interesting will guest-edit one of the UK's flagship programmes, Today on Radio 4. Today, the microphone goes to a top boss in one of Britain's most important, controversial and scandal-dogged industries -- Antony Jenkins, chief executive of Barclays. Jenkins be controlling half the show (don't worry, Today regulars, he won't replace the weather with the early morning share prices, or abolish the sport section). Topping the bill is the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, delivering Thought for the Day. Yes, Jenkins has invited one of the City's sternest critics -- with whom he's crossed swords over bank pay several times -- onto the show. Could be fascinating. The show is also expected to include a meeting with inner-city school children in London, and a discussion with Trevor Manuel, the South African politician on leadership. You can hear Radio 4 live here. And here's the Today web page. We'll be tracking the key points, along with other developments as 2013 slides to a close.",

Tuesday was the turn of the Barclays boss, Antony Jenkins, who modestly chose a story about himself to feature in the show's initial news run. So at a few minutes past 6am, Chris Aldridge obediently announced to a nation of banker-bashers that Jenkins reckons it will take \"up to a decade to rebuild people's trust in his bank following the financial crisis and a succession of scandals\". That line had been pretty well aired in February when Jenkins smoothed: \"I see becoming the 'go-to' bank as a five to 10-year journey,\" but no matter.

She asked Jenkins what he \"wanted to hear from the archbishop\" when he invited him on to the programme, and within seconds the banker's prayers were spectacularly answered. \"People like Antony are dealing with the impact of 30 years in which there was strong pressure to go in one direction,\" the archbishop mused, before explaining how reversing that culture was \"a massive, massive challenge\". \"They're doing it though?\" probed Montague obligingly. \"I think a number of them are doing it,\" Welby said. \"I think Barclays is working very hard at it\". The Today programme has form in this regard, having previously permitted the Barclays boss to explain how bankers need to restore the public's trust and be good citizens. The irksome point about that worthy sentiment, however, is that it was delivered in 2011 by Jenkins' predecessor, the subsequently disgraced Bob Diamond, when he was allowed the microphone for the inaugural BBC Today programme business lecture. So it was left to the some schoolchildren to ask the programme's only challenging questions of Jenkins (he ducked them), leaving the banker to depart from the studio no doubt congratulating himself and his PR handlers on a sermon skilfully delivered.",

    "webTitle": "Latvia joins eurozone at midnight despite little public enthusiasm", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The eurozone will gain an extra member at midnight on Tuesday as Latvia becomes the 18th country to join the single currency union, despite little obvious public enthusiasm for the move. Latvia's arrival gives eurocrats in Brussels an extra reason to toast in the new year. Eighteen months after the threat of Greece quitting the euro gripped financial markets, the eurozone is marking its 15th anniversary by expanding, not fracturing. With final preparations completed, outgoing prime minister Valdis Dombrovskis will ceremonially withdraw the first euro note from an ATM shortly after midnight. European commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso offered his congratulations to Latvia on Tuesday as households and businesses prepared to wave goodbye to their currency, the lats. \"This is a major event, not only for Latvia, but for the euro area itself, which remains stable, attractive and open to new members,\" Barroso said. \"For Latvia, it is the result of impressive efforts and the unwavering determination of the authorities and the Latvian people. Thanks to these efforts, undertaken in the aftermath of a deep economic crisis, Latvia will enter the euro area stronger than ever, sending an encouraging message to other countries undergoing a difficult economic adjustment.\" City analysts were less effusive. ING pointed out that the eurozone was still trying hard to repair the constructional mistakes of the past, and that the former Soviet state could bring its own problems. \"While some look forward to welcome another stability-oriented government, others fear that Latvia could become the next Cyprus,\" ING said. Mark Galeotti, a professor at New York University, has also predicted that suspect funds could flow westward into Latvian banks. \"Immediately after Latvia joins the eurozone I imagine we're going to see an actual spike in dubious money flowing in,\" Galeotti, who researches organised crime in the former Soviet Union, told AP. Within Latvia the eurozone crisis has left some people edgy about the move. Recent opinion polls have shown that a majority of Latvians oppose the move, with just a fifth strongly in favour. Andris Liepins, 51, a shop owner in the capital Riga, told Bloomberg he was \"convinced\" prices will rise under the new currency, and also fears paying for future eurozone bailouts. \"Why does a country have to pay other countries' debts?\" Liepins added. And in a village north-east of Riga, Leonara Timofejeva, who tends graves to earn the minimum wage of 200 lats (\u20ac284) per month, also predicts inflation. \"Everyone expects prices will go up in January,\" she told AFP. Raoul Ruparel, head of economic research at Open Europe, said Latvia would be an \"interesting test case\" as to whether a small country could join the euro region and thrive. He said Brussels would be monitoring the country closely for signs of instability, as \"they don't want a repeat of what happened before\". Latvia has already had a taste of eurozone-style austerity. Wages were slashed and unemployment soared after the 2008 financial crisis struck. After a long credit-fuelled boom, Latvia slumped into a deep recession. The economy is now growing again \u2013 more rapidly than any fellow EU state. \"While Latvia's switch to the euro comes just five years after an international rescue package, which saw its economy shrink by more than a fifth in 2008-2009, it appears to be on the fast track to recovery as their economy is growing at the fastest pace in the European Union this year,\" said analysts at City firm Clear Currency. The Latvian finance minister, Andris Vilks, has argued that Ukraine's recent tug-of-war between the EU and Russia shows the wisdom of making closer ties with Europe. Vilks said: \"Russia isn't going to change. We know our neighbour. There were before, and there will be, a lot of unpredictable conditions. It is very important for the countries to stick together, and with the EU.\" Latvia's own political future is unclear at present. Valdis Dombrovskis resigned as prime minister after 54 people were killed in a supermarket collapse in Riga last month, the country's worst disaster since winning independence in 1991. A new prime minister has not yet been appointed. Eurozone faces more challenges in 2014 Although the threat of eurozone breakup has receded, many experts warn that next year will be challenging. Open Europe's Ruparel says the European Central Bank's asset quality review \u2013 stress-testing the region's banks \u2013 will dominate 2014. It will put the spotlight on banks in France and Italy in particular, he predicts. Europe's economy remains weak, having struggled out of recession this summer, and the jobless rates are at record levels. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said: \"The nagging, never-ending fear is that policymakers like to tell us the crisis is over, but we still have falling bank lending, and we still have levels of unemployment, especially youth unemployment, that would in most countries and at most points in history, have caused a massive political backlash.\" In Latvia, the youth unemployment rate is almost 25%, slightly higher than the eurozone average. In Spain and Greece, the figure is over 50%. Latvia for beginners Here are a few key numbers and facts about Latvia and its adoption of the euro. Latvia has a coastline along the Baltic Sea and borders with Estonia, Russia, Belarus and Lithuania. The capital is Riga, where more than a third of the population lives. Some 44% of the country is forest. Latvia has a population of 2,041,763 and after it joins the eurozone 333 million Europeans will share the same currency Latvia's old currency, the lats (LVL), can be exchanged as of 1 January at an official conversion rate of 1 euro = 0.702804 LVL.

Eighteen months after the threat of Greece quitting the euro gripped financial markets, the eurozone is marking its 15th anniversary by expanding, not fracturing.</p> <p>With final preparations completed, outgoing prime minister Valdis Dombrovskis will ceremonially withdraw the first euro note from an ATM shortly after midnight.</p> <p><a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-1307_en.htm\" title=\"\">European commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso offered his congratulations to Latvia</a> on Tuesday as households and businesses prepared to wave goodbye to their currency, the lats.</p> <p>\"This is a major event, not only for Latvia, but for the euro area itself, which remains stable, attractive and open to new members,\" Barroso said. \"For Latvia, it is the result of impressive efforts and the unwavering determination of the authorities and the Latvian people. Thanks to these efforts, undertaken in the aftermath of a deep economic crisis, Latvia will enter the euro area stronger than ever, sending an encouraging message to other countries undergoing a difficult economic adjustment.\"</p> <p>City analysts were less effusive. ING pointed out that the eurozone was still trying hard to repair the constructional mistakes of the past, and that the former Soviet state could bring its own problems. \"While some look forward to welcome another stability-oriented government, others fear that Latvia could become the next Cyprus,\" ING said.</p> <p>Mark Galeotti, a professor at New York University, has also predicted that suspect funds could flow westward into Latvian banks. \"Immediately after Latvia joins the eurozone I imagine we're going to see an actual spike in dubious money flowing in,\" Galeotti, who researches organised crime in the former Soviet Union, told AP.</p> <p>Within Latvia the eurozone crisis has left some people edgy about the move. <a href=\"http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/latvia-eurozone.rk1\" title=\"\">Recent opinion polls have shown that a majority of Latvians oppose the move</a>, with just a fifth strongly in favour.</p> <p>Andris Liepins, 51, a shop owner in the capital Riga, told Bloomberg he was \"convinced\" prices will rise under the new currency, and also fears paying for future eurozone bailouts.</p> <p>\"Why does a country have to pay other countries' debts?\" Liepins added.</p> <p>And in a village north-east of Riga, Leonara Timofejeva, who tends graves to earn the minimum wage of 200 lats (\u20ac284) per month, also predicts inflation. \"Everyone expects prices will go up in January,\" <a href=\"http://www.rappler.com/business/economy-watch/46734-fireworks-but-no-joy-as-latvia-joins-eurozone\" title=\"\">she told AFP</a>.</p> <p>Raoul Ruparel, head of economic research at Open Europe, said Latvia would be an \"interesting test case\" as to whether a small country could join the euro region and thrive. He said Brussels would be monitoring the country closely for signs of instability, as \"they don't want a repeat of what happened before\".</p> <p>Latvia has already had a taste of eurozone-style austerity. Wages were slashed and unemployment soared after the 2008 financial crisis struck. After a long credit-fuelled boom, Latvia slumped into a deep recession.</p> <p>The economy is now growing again \u2013 more rapidly than any fellow EU state.</p> <p>\"While Latvia's switch to the euro comes just five years after an international rescue package, which saw its economy shrink by more than a fifth in 2008-2009, it appears to be on the fast track to recovery as their economy is growing at the fastest pace in the European Union this year,\" said analysts at City firm Clear Currency.</p> <p>The Latvian finance minister, Andris Vilks, has argued that Ukraine's recent tug-of-war between the EU and Russia shows the wisdom of making closer ties with Europe.</p> <p>Vilks said: \"Russia isn't going to change. We know our neighbour. There were before, and there will be, a lot of unpredictable conditions. It is very important for the countries to stick together, and with the EU.\"</p> <p>Latvia's own political future is unclear at present. Valdis Dombrovskis resigned as prime minister after 54 people were killed in a supermarket collapse in Riga last month, the country's worst disaster since winning independence in 1991. A new prime minister has not yet been appointed.</p> <h2>Eurozone faces more challenges in 2014</h2> <p>Although the threat of eurozone breakup has receded, many experts warn that next year will be challenging. Open Europe's Ruparel says the European Central Bank's asset quality review \u2013 stress-testing the region's banks \u2013 will dominate 2014. It will put the spotlight on banks in France and Italy in particular, he predicts.</p> <p>Europe's economy remains weak, having struggled out of recession this summer, and the jobless rates are at record levels.</p> <p>Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said: \"The nagging, never-ending fear is that policymakers like to tell us the crisis is over, but we still have falling bank lending, and we still have levels of unemployment, especially youth unemployment, that would in most countries and at most points in history, have caused a massive political backlash.\"</p> <p>In Latvia, the youth unemployment rate is almost 25%, slightly higher than the eurozone average. In Spain and Greece, the figure is over 50%.</p> <h2>Latvia for beginners<br></h2> <p>Here are a few key numbers and facts about Latvia and its adoption of the euro.</p> <p>Latvia has a coastline along the Baltic Sea and borders with Estonia, Russia, Belarus and Lithuania.

John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), warns that small businesses need a fair deal from big energy companies, which have faced criticism for complex charging structures that appear to have little resemblance to the price of energy. \"It is now accepted by all political parties that reform to the structure of the energy market is vital for fairness,\" Allan says. \"As well as reforming markets, the increasing recognition that small and especially micro businesses who behave like domestic consumers should be afforded similar levels of protection in the market is an important step in the right direction.\" Earlier this month the Treasury named the FSB as a \"super complainant\" with official powers to raise concerns about treatment of small businesses with the Financial Conduct Authority. \"This is a big challenge, but one we are ready for in order to stand up for small firms that have been treated unfairly,\" Allan says. The FSB is currently working with the British Chambers of Commerce on a survey of small business banking services. Allan says he is personally shocked by the high cost of business rates. \"In some cases small firms pay more in rates than rent. This cannot be right and the appeals process is often lengthy and unfair. \"Given the cost and unfair process, we are pleased the government has committed to address the appeals backlog, a key ask for the FSB in the Autumn statement. \"The extension of small business rate relief is another win for us too, however our work on business rates is not done. We will step up our pressure for a fundamental review of the system.\"",
