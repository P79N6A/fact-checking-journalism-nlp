      "bodyText": "The current strong pound is starting to bite into the profits of corporate Britain. Aircraft-engine maker Rolls-Royce, defence group BAE Systems, and contract caterer Compass were among the heavyweights who lined up last week to say that adverse currency movements were wiping millions off their balance sheets. Over the past year, sterling has risen 10% against a basket of currencies: it gained more than 10% against the euro, and 11% against the dollar. As a consequence, London-listed companies with divisions in Europe and the US are taking a hit when they translate their foreign earnings back into pounds. Adverse currency movements drove more than 20% of UK profit warnings in the first half of 2014, compared with just 3% last year, according to a recent report by accountancy group EY. Justin Cooper, chief executive of shareholder solutions at Capita Asset Services, said UK investors in Royal Dutch Shell paid the price of a stronger pound last week, when the oil company reported a 4% increase in its second quarter dividend. \"Shell declares its dividends in US dollars, so UK investors will actually feel a 4% cut after the strength of sterling is taken into account,\" he said. On the face of it, there is a lot to be said for a strong currency. British holidaymakers travelling abroad find their spending money goes further. And more broadly, a stronger currency usually reflects a stronger economy, and a better outlook compared with peers. The key factor behind sterling's rise over the past year is closely linked to the latter point. Britain's recovery is well-established now and the economy is widely expected to outperform its G7 peers this year. As a result, markets believe the UK will be the first to raise interest rates, and this is pushing the pound higher. It also reflects the relative positions of Britain's major trading partners \u2013 Europe and the US. Scotiabank economist Alan Clarke says: \"With the eurozone at risk of slipping into recession and the prospect of the European Central Bank embarking on quantitative easing, the euro should be weakening against the pound. Similarly, the US Federal Reserve is still loosening policy through QE, which typically weakens a currency.\" Aside from the negative impact being felt by some of Britain's largest companies when translating foreign earnings into sterling, there is a bigger fear that a strengthening pound will hurt the nation's exporters and, in so doing, derail one of the chancellor's key ambitions. Back in 2012, George Osborne set a target of doubling UK exports to \u00a31 trillion by 2020. In his March budget he prioritised the country's \"makers, doers and savers\", extending a long-running script in which a strong sustainable future depends on rebalancing the economy. A stronger pound is therefore far from ideal for an economy which is trying to reinvent itself as a manufacturing power \u2013 less reliant on the debt-fuelled consumer spending of the past and more reliant on exports. Business lobby groups are growing increasingly concerned about the plight of British manufacturers and exporters. \"The recent rises in sterling have made life more difficult for both new and experienced exporters, and further strengthens the case against a premature rise in interest rates,\" says John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. \"Early rate rises may limit the growth ambitions of the very firms we are counting on to drive the rebalancing of the economy.\" Part of the problem is that Britain did not capitalise on the weaker pound during the crisis years. Last March, one of his final speeches before retiring, former Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean said that any further rise in sterling would be unwelcome, damaging hopes of an export boost to the economy. He made the point that the 25% fall in the sterling between the middle of 2007 and the beginning of 2009 \u2013 making UK goods and services significantly cheaper abroad \u2013 should have been a major boost to exports, despite the slowdown in its main export markets. But this did not happen, and Osborne's march of the makers is trying to redress that missed opportunity. Longworth insists, however, that the weaker pound had been helpful to exporters: \"It mitigated other factors, such as difficulty finding access to finance and a general slowdown in global demand.\" Others believe the absence of a boost to exports when the pound was weak shows that the impact of currency fluctuations on exports is overplayed. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg, says recent signs of slowing growth in British manufacturing probably have more to do with poor global growth and an escalation of troubles in Ukraine than with the strong pound. \"The Channel is not wide enough to insulate British manufacturers from wobbles in their main trading partner,\" he said. \"Sterling is not likely to be the main explanation. If the post-2007 devaluation teaches us anything, it is that exports are not very sensitive to sterling.\" Nonetheless, fear of a resurgent pound wreaking havoc remains. Members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) have made it clear that they are closely watching the appreciation of the currency. UK interest rates have been at 0.5% since March 2009, in the wake of the Lehman Brothers collapse at the peak of the credit crisis. With the ensuing economic scars barely healed, policymakers are now left with the difficult dilemma of when to start normalising rates, given that markets, businesses and consumers have become hooked on cheap borrowing. The MPC is keenly aware that an early rate rise is likely to send the pound sharply higher, possibly doing further harm to UK export prospects. That \u2013along with a lack of wage growth and low inflation \u2013 is a factor being cited in the case against an increase. The precedent of Japan is another factor. The world's third-largest economy is a poster child for the way a strong currency can hurt a country's manufacturers. Along with the US dollar, the Japanese yen is considered a safe-haven currency. During the financial crisis, investors piled into the yen, stifling Japan's export-led economy. While forecasting exchange rate movements can be a dicey business, Scotiabank's Clarke believes sterling is likely to strengthen further in the coming months, at least against the euro. \"I think the pound will continue to strengthen against the euro as the first Bank of England rate rise approaches and the eurozone gets closer to deflation and quantitative easing. However, there is the risk of a setback against the dollar. Assumptions about the UK economy going from strength to strength are likely to be challenged. Business surveys have already suffered a little and that is likely to continue. Meanwhile US activity is looking perkier. So the pound could weaken a bit against the dollar, but it is unlikely to fall off a cliff.\" David Bloom, global head of foreign exchange strategy at HSBC, also said potential for a stronger dollar next year would provide some relief for those suffering under the strong pound. He cautions: \"You've got to be careful what you wish for. You can get a weaker currency for a range of reasons, including political and economic uncertainty. If you want a strong pound it has to be for the right reasons \u2013 because someone else's currency is stronger.\" Political uncertainty is not in short supply in the UK, which is facing a vote on Scottish independence, a general election next year, and a potential exit from the European Union thereafter. Next year, a weak pound could be no cause for celebration.",

      "bodyText": "Ask the Bank of England about the biggest threat to the recovery and the answer will most likely be the housing market. Since the governor, Mark Carney, warned in May about the risk of another big debt overhang, the housing market has shown signs of coming off the boil a little. No doubt this week's monthly meeting of the monetary policy committee will spend some time debating whether this is the start of a slowdown. But for anyone hoping to buy their first home, houses are becoming less affordable. What's more, the chronic lack of supply looks set to keep many people outside the property market for years to come. While the central bank rightly focuses on the economic risks this brings \u2013 from harm to the banking sector to depressed spending by debt-laden households \u2013 policymakers in government have been depressingly quiet about the deep social changes that are becoming entrenched as a consequence. Consider these recent trends: more young adults living with their parents; people starting families later; more young workers sharing homes; and a sharp rise in renting. In all four cases, housing affordability has been cited among the probable driving forces. On one of the simplest measures of affordability, UK house prices have risen to more than six times annual earnings in recent months. As the Bank notes, that is lower than the 2007 peak of more than seven times earnings, but higher than the average in the decade before 2007, of around five times. Against this backdrop, home ownership is falling, and for younger generations is increasingly out of reach. The proportion of 25-year-olds buying their own home has halved in 20 years, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The way things are going, owning a home risks becoming the privilege of the lucky few who inherit enough to join the gilded section of the population enriched by soaring house values. MPs show little sign of noticing, but these trends are having a marked impact on the way we live. Terms such as \"empty nest syndrome\" are being replaced with the \"clipped-wing generation\", in the words of housing charity Shelter, which finds almost two million young working adults still living with their parents. Revealing last month that the average age of mothers in England and Wales had risen to 30 for the first time, the Office for National Statistics cited housing as a possible factor. It also recently published figures showing a sharp rise in households of more than six people, and an increase in house-sharing. Its analysis of 2011 census data noted a rise in both multi-generational households \u2013 presumably those clipped-wingers in their childhood bedrooms \u2013 and in young working adults sharing accommodation. The problem of affordability is obviously most acute in the capital, and the housing data company Hometrack highlights a rise in tenants sharing in order to afford London rents. There are people for whom renting with friends is a happy choice. Also, from a labour mobility perspective, such flexible living arrangements can be helpful to the economy. Sadly, the survey shows these young adults are in large part not sharing homes through choice. To put it in television terms, this not so much the happy, harmonious world of Friends as the antagonism of the This Life flatshare. Whether people share or not, private renting is on the rise. The government's latest English housing survey showed that in 2012-13, the number of households in the private rented sector had overtaken the number in social housing for the first time. And those renting were least happy with that choice: just over half of private renters agreed that it was a good way of occupying a home, compared with 82% of social renters and 93% of owner-occupiers. The findings were even more downbeat in a separate poll by ComRes for campaign group Generation Rent. Two-thirds of private renters said the main reason they rented was because they could not afford to buy. Their prospects of scraping together a deposit look dim. The pitiful wage growth of recent years has made not just buying less affordable, but renting too. The English housing survey found tenants spent 40% of their income on rent, while owner-occupiers spent just 20% on mortgages. With such patterns condemning millions to private rentals, Generation Rent wants urgent changes to make renting fit for purpose. It is calling for the right to a five-year tenancy, to give nine million tenants more security. And so it should. More than half of UK homes will be rented by 2032 if current housing trends go unchecked, according to projections from the Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association. But protections for tenants are not keeping pace. Politicians must wake up and look beyond the homeowning voters they have wooed for so long. Ultimately, they have to get to grips with Britain's lack of housing supply. As long as it falls so far behind demand, the barriers between the haves and have-nots in the housing market will stand tall. Renting can be a financially sensible and happy choice, but our housing policies have made it a second-class option. With supply short for both rented and owned homes, the odds will always be skewed against tenants.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Richard Eiker has worked for McDonald's for 25 years. For the last 18 he has been at the same Kansas City restaurant working in maintenance, mopping floors, cleaning bathrooms, scrubbing grease out of the deep fat fryers. He has no illusions about who he works for: McDonald's. The burger chain begs to differ. Over the last 30 years fast food jobs have come to take an ever larger part of the US labour market. In 2013 3.6 million people worked for fast food restaurants in the US. But most \u2013 76% \u2013 worked for franchisees and not directly for the companies whose logos adorn the restaurants. Wages, hours, benefits \u2013 increasingly hot topics in this low-paying industry \u2013 have to be negotiated with the franchisee. That may be about to change. Last week the National Labour Relations Board (NLRB), which investigates unfair employment practices, ruled that McDonald's could be held jointly liable for employment and wage violations by its franchise operators. The ruling followed a flood of complaints about retaliation against workers after a series of strikes and protests over wages and conditions at McDonald's and its competitors. Eiker, who earns $11.05 (\u00a36.56) an hour, joined the nationwide day of protest for fast food workers on 15 May by going on strike. He doesn't blame the franchisee, he blames McDonald's. \"McDonald's says it's not a boss, but it certainly acts like one. Setting rules and controlling just about every aspect of its stores, so that the only thing that franchisees can skimp on is wages,\" he said after the ruling. He said the rules imposed by McDonald's made it impossible for the franchisee to increase wages. To him it's clear who is really in charge. McDonald's corporate representatives turn up at the restaurant where he works five or six times a year, counting the number of cars using the drive-though service, timing sales, making sure staff are preparing food according to McDonald's specifications, said Eiker. The company sends in secret shoppers to check how long it takes to get served, whether staff are smiling or not, how advertising is displayed. Once a month the manager gets a report from McDonald's on the secret shoppers' findings. \"There are repercussions if, for example, a drive order took too long to fill. People have been suspended for getting a negative review from the secret shoppers,\" he said. Eiker said a clear example of McDonald's involvement was the corporate computer system that gives up-to-the minute reports on employees and sales. \"Managers are pushing all the time to bring down costs,\" he said. \"I have heard comments that labour is too high, and when that happens people get sent home.\" Richard Griffin Jr, the NLRB's general counsel, agrees with Eiker that the company has too much say not to be counted as a \"joint employer\". But the argument will not stop there. McDonald's and the National Restaurant Association have made clear they would appeal. Griffin will have to argue his case before an administrative law judge, the NLRB will have to vote on it after that and, if it were approved as expected, opponents would inevitably take it back to court. Catherine Fisk, law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said there was a long road ahead for the case, and it might end up in the supreme court. Despite the difficulties ahead, Fisk said the decision marked a historic moment that could potentially change who had to come to the table to discuss labour issues. Franchisees asked to increase wages or hours could argue they have little room to manoeuvre on costs, as they have to pay McDonald's. They cannot increase food prices or make any other significant changes to their businesses without McDonald's consent. With McDonald's defined as a joint employer, unions could press for greater recognition instead of having to unionise one franchise at a time. The Service Employees International Union, a two million-strong union that represents healthcare and public service workers, has financed much of the backlash against the fast food firms as it has sought to unionise their workers. With McDonald's involved in wage negotiations, it would be impossible for the company to palm off the reason its workers receive such low wages to its franchisees, said Fisk. The business community is up in arms. Angelo Amador, vice-president of labour and workforce at the National Restaurant Association, said: \"This decision shakes the very basis of our industry and how we've created jobs.\" Amador said the decision overturned 30 years of law that a company was not responsible for the labour practices of its franchisees and that it threatened job growth across the US, not just in restaurants but in construction, manufacturing and any area where work is contracted out. He suggested that this was a political decision and said the NLRB had always been \"anything but impartial\". He added: \"It's always been semi-political but this is unprecedented.\" The dispute comes amid rising protests about the treatment of fast food workers and an increasingly heated debate over an increase in the federal minimum wage that has been championed by President Barack Obama and challenged by business and Republican opponents. For Fisk, the NLRB's move is a small step on the path to a wider debate about how the law adapts to \"the business structures that now dominate low-wage work\". As long as the companies can put their franchisees between them and their workers, that debate will be stifled, she said. \"We've all had those conversations with airline workers where they've been told: 'Gee, I'd like to help you, but I can't.' Well, that's no negotiation at all,\" said Fisk. \"What workers want is for McDonald's to be at the negotiation table.\"",
