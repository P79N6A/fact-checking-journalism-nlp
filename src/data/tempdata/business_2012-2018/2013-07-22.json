    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Federal Aviation Authority was due to order mandatory inspections of the emergency beacons aboard Boeing's ill-fated 787 Dreamliner as early as Monday after a fire broke out aboard one of the planes in London. The FAA \"airworthiness directive\" comes just two months after the 787 was certified to fly again following a global grounding triggered by problems with its lithium-ion battery system. A fire aboard an Ethiopian Airways jet at London's Heathrow airport earlier this month forced the closure of both runways for more than an hour. The UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) concluded that the fire started near the aircraft's emergency locator transmitter \u2013 a distress beacon used to help rescuers find a plane if, for example, it is forced to land on water or in polar regions. The focus of attention appears to be whether a pinched wire under the battery cover triggered a short circuit. The FAA spent the weekend telling other aviation safety regulators around the world of its concerns. It is expected to formally issue the directive early this week, possibly as early as Monday. The beacons, made by Honeywell, are powered by a lithium manganese battery, which could have suffered a short circuit. Last week the FAA said its inspections would call for operators to check \"proper wire routing and any signs of wire damage or pinching, as well as inspect the battery compartment for unusual signs of heating or moisture.\" Robert Mann, an aviation expert at consultant RW Mann, said it was unclear whether the latest issue was caused by installation, quality control issues or design issues specifically related to the 787. Honeywell had issues with its emergency locators in 2009 that led to the beacons failing to send out signals. But Mann said the issue could also be specific to the Dreamliner. The 787 is the world's most technologically advanced passenger jet. Its use of lightweight materials means its uses 20% less fuel than its peers. Aluminum wiring and Teflon coating are used to save weight. \"We got rid of aluminum wiring in the US in the 1980s because of the tendency of aluminum oxide to cause problems,\" said Mann. \"And there have been reports of fragility with Teflon insulation.\" So far there are just 68 Dreamliners in service and more teething issues are likely to worry passengers and delay orders. Boeing's shares dipped lower Monday morning even as the US stock markets rose. \"This plane need to get out of the headlines and get on with what it is supposed to be doing,\" said Mann.",

This despite the country's main political parties failing to agree the 'National Salvation' deal he had called for.</p> <p>Speaking to the nation last night, <strong>Cavaco Silva</strong> declared:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The best solution is to keep the current government in power....</p> <p>I think in the current context of national emergency, calling elections is not a solution for the problems Portugal is facing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is important to show our European partners that Portugal is a governable country.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Cavaco Silva</strong> adressed the Portuguese people after a week of talks between the centre-right coalition and the socialist opposition broke up without an agreement on Friday night. The Socialists, it seems, were not prepared to back Portugal's painful bailout programme.</p> <p>So having failed to whisk up a government of national salvation, <strong>Cavaco Silva</strong> has now thrown his support behind prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho.

      "bodyText": "That's all for the day. Here's a round-up of the main events. \u2022 Portugal's prime minister has pledged to stick to the terms of the country's bailout, after weeks of political turbulence. Pedro Passos Coelho told a press conference that he was committed to the current economic plan, and to rebuilding confidence with the rest of the world. Passos Coelho also confirmed that his junior coalition partner would take a prime role in negotiating with its troika of lenders. (see 12.03pm onwards). \u2022 There was general relief after Portugal's president announced last night that he would not seek an early general election, following the collapse of talks over a 'National Salvation' government. (see 7.59am) \u2022 Portugal's government bonds strengthened through the day, as traders calculated that its debt was less risky. Shares in Lisbon also rallied. (see 12.12pm for details of the bond rally, and 5pm for the closing market prices). \u2022 But despite the relief, many City experts believe Portugal may need a second aid deal when its bailout runs out. See 8.53am and 10.52am for the latest analysis. \u2022 Spain's prime minister bowed to pressure over its slush fund scandal. Mariano Rajoy said he would answer questiosn on the issue in the next few weeks. (see 4.22pm onwards) \u2022 In Greece, anger over public sector job cuts has not abated. Teachers held another protest in Athens (photos at 3.04pm), while medical staff are planning a strike on Wednesday (see 2.54pm). \u2022 And the eurozone's debt pile kept growing. Total government borrowing now equals 92.2% of GDP. Greece, Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus suffered the biggest increases. (See 10.27am onwards). I'll be back tomorrow. Until then, thanks all and goodnight. GW Portugal's stock market has posted strong gains today, on relief that the country is not lurching towards an early general election. The PSI index closed almost 2.5% higher, led by financial stocks, with two banks posting double-digit gains. And Portuguese government debt rallied through the day. The yield on 10-year bonds remains sharply lower tonight at 6.39%, from nearly 7% before trading began today. It was a quieter day in other markets, though, as the summer slowdown kicks in. Closing prices. \u2022 PSI 20: up 126 points at 5651, + 2.3% \u2022 FTSE 100: down 7.5 points at 6623, -0.1% \u2022 German DAX: down 0.5 points at 8331, - 0.01% \u2022 French CAC: up 14 points at 3939, +0.37% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 22 points at 7966, + 0.29% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 109 points at 16233, + 0.68% David Jones, chief market strategist at IG, sums up the situation in London: It has been a drowsy day on the market, with the FTSE 100 drifting aimlessly for most of the day, as London enjoys what might be the end of the current heatwave. Economic data has been a touch poorer, but not bad enough to inspire panic or change expectations about central bank policy. Overall, today\u2019s market has something of the 'coiled spring' about it, seeming to be waiting for an excuse to move higher. And here are the key quotes from Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy this afternoon (via Reuters) I have talked to the head of parliament and I have told him that I would ask to appear at the end of the month or at the beginning of August. I will appear before parliament in order to give full explanations because I believe that's where I should do it. Important developments in Spain. The prime minister has announced he will appear in parliament in the next few weeks to answer questions over the slush fund scandal that has dominated Spanish politics for months. Mariano Rajoy told a press conference this afternoon that he will answer questions over allegations that Luis Barcenas, former Popular Party treasurer, ran an illegal payments operation which benefitted top party officials, includign Rajoy himself. The session is likely to take place at the end of July, or the beginning of August. Rajoy announced the plan at a press confernence with the prime minister of Romania today, as journalist Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sardo explains: Rajoy has been under mounting pressure since new documents and text messages released this month appeared to move him closer to the scandal. The PM has repeatedly denied any involvement, while avoiding answering questions about the allegations. Many protests have taken place in Spain, with people calling for his resignation. And a poll published on Sunday found that almost 90% of Spaniards believe Rajoy should give a full account. Sounds like they may get their wish.... On a lighter note, former Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King has been enrolled into the House of Lords today. Lord King (in the middle of the ermine-clad trio in the tweet above) won't be gracing the red leather benches every day -- as he's also accepted a position of visiting professor at New York University's Stern School of Business and School of Law. Open Europe, the think tank, has blogged on the latest developments in Portugal, here: Beyond appearances, the recent political crisis has changed things in Portugal It argues that the promotion of junior coalition leader Paulo Portas to deputy PM (see 1.10pm) with responsibility for dealing with the troika, is an important change: Let's not forget Portas tendered his resignation from the government because he disagreed with Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho over the appointment of Maria Lu\u00eds Albuquerque as new Finance Minister. On that occasion, Portas made clear that he was hoping for a change in the country's economic policy approach (in substance, less austerity). That could mean further tensions between the coalition, with Portas's conservatives pushing for less austerity, while the prime minister's Social Democrats stick to the current policy. And here's a few photos from Athens of the protest held today by Greek schoolteachers (10.01am), against plans to move 2,000 staff in a mobility scheme, which could lead to being laid off. More industrial unrest in Greece. Kathimerini reports that heathcare workers will be striking on Wednesday, in protest at plans to transfer workers to the new 'labour pool' (part of the programme for cutting thousands of public sector jobs) It reports: Public hospitals, health centers and the ambulance service will operate with skeleton staff on Wednesday due to a strike by employees. Doctors and nurses have called the action to protest the government\u2019s plans to place 2,500 healthcare staff in a mobility scheme which will lead to them being transferred or dismissed. Meanwhile in the City, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has slapped a fine of nearly \u00a3600,000 on a high-frequency trader for manipulating the oil price. The City watchdog has announced this lunchtime that Michael Coscia had been penalised for running an \"abusive trading strategy\" in which he would place a small buy order, then flood the market with large sell orders to move the oil price. The instant the buy order was taken he'd cancel the large sell orders, then repeat the process in reverse to square out the position. That strategy yielded decent profits for Coscia, at the expense of the rest of the market. As the FCA explains (full details here): Between 6 September 2011 and 18 October 2011 Coscia used an algorithmic programme of his own design to instigate an abusive trading strategy known as \u201clayering\u201d. During this time, Coscia placed thousands of false orders for Brent Crude, Gas Oil and Western Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures from the US on the ICE Futures Europe exchange (ICE) in the UK. Taking advantage of the price movements generated by his layering strategy, Coscia made a profit of US $279,920 over the 6 week period of trading at the expense of other market participants - primarily other High Frequency Traders or traders using algorithmic and/or automated systems. This is the first time the FCA has taken enforcement action against a High Frequency Trader. American regulators are also imposing financial penalties, relating to trading on US oil exchanges. High-frequency trading uses high-powered computers, high-speed links and sophisticated algorithms to execute trades in fractions of a second. Supporters of HFT say it increases liquidity and means the gap between buy and sell orders is narrowed. However, it has been blamed for sparking wild swings in prices, such as in the Wall Street Flash Crash of 2010. Its critics include many MEPs, who voted last autumn to ban HFT in a clampdown on 'purely speculative' financial activity - even though it (unlike Coscia's activities) does not breach any rules. That ban has yet to come into law, and was opposed by the UK. Portugal's PM has now announced that Paulo Portas, his junior coalition partner will be given responsibility for \"co-ordinating\" negotiations with the Troika. Pedro Passos Coehlo also confirmed that Portas will become Portugal's new deputy prime minister -- proving that old adage that a well-timed resignation can do wonders for a career*. It was Portas's shock decision to quit on July 2 that inflamed the crisis, a day after former finance minister Vitor Gaspar threw in the towel. There's going to be a wider cabinet reshuffle too - but the details aren't available yet. Latest newsflashes: 12:40 - PORTUGAL PRIME MINISTER SAYS MY INTENTION REMAINS TO RESHUFFLE CABINET, TERMS TO BE DETAILED 12:41 - PORTUGAL PRIME MINISTER SAYS RESHUFFLE PROPOSAL IS FOR JUNIOR COALITION PARTNER PORTAS TO BE DEPUTY PM 12:43 - PORTUGAL PRIME MINISTER SAYS RESHUFFLE WOULD MAKE PORTAS COORDINATOR OF TALKS WITH LENDERS, SPENDING REFORM * - don't try this in the office, folks.... Portuguese bond yields have now fallen back to the levels seen at the start of July, before finance minister Vitor Gaspar sparked the crisis by resigning. Portuguese government bonds are on a roll this morning, leaping in value as investors welcome prime minister Passos Coelho's commitment to Portugal's bailout plan, and the news that early elections have been ruled out. The yield (interest rate) on its 10-year bonds has now tumbled to 6.4%, down from 6.92% on Friday night. Portugal's prime minister has vowed to stick to the country's bailout programme, and rebuild confidence in the country following the confusion and discord of the last fortnightthree weeks. Pedro Passos Coelho said that his government remained to delivering the targets agreed with its Troika of lenders. That includes exiting its bailout in 2014, he insisted. In his first speech since president Cavaco Silva ruled out early elections last night, Passos Coelho declared: We will rebuild the confidence without raising any doubts about the process we are carrying out, saying 'yes, we want to complete the assistance programme on the agreed date'. Passos Coelho also argued that Portugal's difficult circumstances means its auterity programme must continue, as flagged up at 11.34am. News flashes from Portugal: \u2022 11:27 - PORTUGAL PRIME MINISTER SAYS AUSTERITY IS IMPOSED BY COUNTRY'S DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES 22-Jul-2013 \u2022 11:30 - PORTUGAL PRIME MINISTER SAYS NEED PROFOUND REFORMS TO REBUILD CONFIDENCE \u2022 11:31 - PORTUGAL PRIME MINISTER SAYS POLITICAL CRISIS HAS DENTED CONFIDENCE 22-Jul-2013 \u202211:32 - PORTUGAL PRIME MINISTER SAYS WE WANT TO COMPLETE BAILOUT PROGRAMME AS AGREED IN MID-2014 More to follow.... Another point on today's eurozone government borrowing figures (see 10.27am onwards) -- the countries suffering the biggest rise in debt, as a percentage of GDP, are all in bailout programmes or trying desperately to avoid one. Over the last year, the highest increases in the GDP/debt ratios were recorded in Greece (+24.1 percentage points), Ireland (+18.3%), Spain (+15.25%), Portugal (+14.9%) and Cyprus (+12.6%). Across the EU, twenty-four Member States registered an increase in their debt to GDP ratio at the end of the first quarter of 2013. The three who achieved a decrease over the last 12 months were Latvia (-5.1%), Lithuania (-1.9%) and Denmark (-0.2%). [Germany posted a fall over the last three months, but not year-on-year]. The BBC's Gavin Hewitt agrees that today's eurozone debt levels (see 10.27am) shows how the region's austerity programmes have failed to lower the region's borrowing, as a percentage of national output. Both Greece and Italy's figures show the negative impact of those austerity programmes \u2013 it's hard to cut your debt-to-GDP ratio if your economy is shrinking. Back to Portugal. Mujtaba Rahman, Europe director at Eurasia Group, agrees that Pedro Passos Coelho's coalition government is unlikely to hang on until 2015. Rahman also warns that Portugal's chances of exiting its bailout next year are receding, following the collapse of the 'national salvation' talks on Friday night (see 7.59am). We'll get a clearer picture of the situation this autumn, when Portugal's lenders return to assess the situation, as Rahman explains: As a result of the political impasse over the course of the last month, the eighth Troika review will now most likely take place alongside the ninth review, at some point in late September/early October. As we've previously argued, there is implicit policy space within the program to account for the developments of recent days. The next big milestones are the passage of a number of bills related to state reform (for example, measures on voluntary dismissals; streamlining the expenditures of line ministries and pension reforms, among others) that are supposed to inform the draft budget for mid/late-October and, in so doing, the fiscal targets for 2014-15. As long as these bills are passed by the parliament by mid/late-October, the fiscal situation-at least in terms of government effort-should still be on track. Still, given the developments of the last several weeks, this is unlikely to improve the prospects for smooth program exit and follow-up next year. The collective national debt of the eurozone jumped to 92.2% of annual economic output in the first quarter of 2013, from 90.6% three months earlier. Only two euro-area countries cut their debt, as a percentage of GDP, over the last year \u2013 Germany and Estonia \u2013 according to new data released by Eurostat this morning. Across the wider European Union, the government debt pile rose to 85.9% in the first three months of 2013, up from 85.2% in the previous quarter. A year ago, the eurozone debt-to-GDP ratio was 88.2%, compared to 83.3% for the EU. So, after another year of austerity programmes and a recession, Europe's debt position has worsened. Eurostat's full release is online here, and explains: The highest ratios of government debt to GDP at the end of the first quarter of 2013 were recorded in Greece (160.5%), Italy (130.3%), Portugal (127.2%) and Ireland (125.1%), and the lowest in Estonia (10.0%), Bulgaria (18.0%) and Luxembourg (22.4%). Over in Greece, schoolteachers are planning another protest as the first wave of public sector job losses begins. The Federation of Secondary Schoolteachers (OLME) has called a demonstration for noon today (10am BST). It is unhappy that 2,000 teachers are being removed from their technical and vocational high schools, and transferred to the 'labour reserve'. They could be laid off early next year, if new positions have not been found for them. OLME is planning legal action to prevent the transfers going ahead, despite MPs approving the legislation to bring in public sector job cuts last week. Portuguese debt continues to rise in value... Several analysts, are suggesting today that Portugal will need a second aid programme, when its existing \u20ac78bn bailout ends in 2014. Jamie McGeever of Reuters sums up this morning's research notes: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets commented: With the next troika report delayed until after the German elections, both parties are expected to stagger on trying to implement the bailout agreement as the Portuguese president decides on what steps to take next. This failure to adopt consensus is becoming all too familiar in the politics of southern Europe and is likely to jeopardise any prospect of Portugal being able to return to the markets next year. What seems more likely is that the country will probably need another bailout. While David Buik of Panmure Gordon agrees that debt restructuring is inevitable, in Portugal and beyond: Even if an election is avoided, Portugal economically is still hanging in rags, as is Spain and Greece!... The sooner there is a realisation that Ireland, Portugal, Greece and probably Spain has no chance of repaying or sustaining its debt and that haircuts will need to be taken across the spectrum, the quicker we can all get on with our lives. Shares have also risen on the Lisbon stock market, although we've seen more vigorous relief rallies in our time. \u2022 The PSI 20 is up 31 points at 5556, +0.57% Most other European markets are sliding a little, but it's all rather tame: \u2022 FTSE 100: down 16 points at 6614, -0.25% \u2022 German DAX: down 6 points at 8325, - 0.1% \u2022 French CAC: down 5 points at 3920, -0.1% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 5 points at 7937, -0.07% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 16 points at 16141, + 0.1% There's little major economic news on the calendar, so it could be a quiet day in the City.... Portuguese government debt has risen in value this morning, as investors welcome the decision not to call early elections in Portugal. This has pushed the interest rate, or yield, on Portuguese 10-year bonds down to 6.84% (as measuresd by Tradeweb), from 6.92% on Friday. Further away from the 7% 'danger zone', where a country is priced out of the markets [Portugal's immediate borrowing needs are covered by its bailout, of course]. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. Like the thunder over London early this morning, Portugal's political crisis is rumbling on. After nearly three weeks of turmoil, Portuguese president Anibal Cavaco Silva has backed the present government and ruled out early elections. This despite the country's main political parties failing to agree the 'National Salvation' deal he had called for. Speaking to the nation last night, Cavaco Silva declared: The best solution is to keep the current government in power.... I think in the current context of national emergency, calling elections is not a solution for the problems Portugal is facing. Adding: It is important to show our European partners that Portugal is a governable country. Cavaco Silva adressed the Portuguese people after a week of talks between the centre-right coalition and the socialist opposition broke up without an agreement on Friday night. The Socialists, it seems, were not prepared to back Portugal's painful bailout programme. So having failed to whisk up a government of national salvation, Cavaco Silva has now thrown his support behind prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho. He'll continue to lead the coalition, alongside deputy leader Paulo Portas whose resignation 13 days ago ignited the tinderbox of austerity fatigue and economic gloom. By not calling for early elections, Cavaco Silva has dampened down fears over Portugal's immediate future. But its chances of returning to the financial markets in 2014 are looking thinner. Without a unity government, it will be harder to push through any further austerity measures that may be needed to keep Portugal's financial programme on track. Unlike lightning, eurozone bailouts certainly can strike twice. Will Portugal need another? I'll be tracking the situation in Portugal through the day, along with the latest developments across the eurozone and beyond...",

      "bodyText": "Britain's economy is being rapidly re-shaped by a digital revolution that is proving more far-reaching than government figures suggest, according to a new report. A study by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) \u2013 one of the UK's leading thinktanks \u2013 found that the digital economy was 40% bigger than previously believed. The report said that the 65-year-old system for classifying companies used by the Office for National Statistics had failed to detect how businesses in sectors such as manufacturing, engineering and architecture are embracing new digital technologies. Using data from Growth Intelligence, a company that tracks businesses, NIESR calculated that the UK had 270,000 digital companies, far higher than the ONS estimate of 188,000. The study found that the revenues of digital companies were growing 25% faster than non-digital companies and had employment levels above those of non-digital companies. While official figures show that 5% of Britons work in the digital sector, the NIESR report put the figure at 11%. The findings \u2013 disputed by the ONS \u2013 suggested that the traditional method of classifying companies had missed out a large number of enterprises such as those involved in business and domestic software and engineering-related scientfic and technical consulting. Max Nathan, senior research fellow at NIESR, said: \"Policymakers have identified the digital economy as one of the UK's key economic strengths. That means they need to be aware of the true numbers of digital businesses around the country. \"The old image of tech businesses as start-ups that make no money is out of date too: using big data we show a broad array of active businesses selling digital products and services.\" Tom Gatten, chief executive of Growth Intelligence, said: \"This research demonstrates the need for a new way of understanding the economy, both for government and for businesses. Rather than relying on outdated codes or static lists, our new technology and internet data reveals new opportunities and insights for growth.\" An ONS official said: \"We are confident ONS statistics reliably measure the size and shape of the economy according to best international practice.\"",

It said FTSE 350 companies should be forced into considering a range of firms because the task of auditing accounts is too important to be left undisturbed for more than five years. It added that current rules are too focused on satisfying management rather than shareholder needs. The proposal was part of the commission's provisional findings into competition in the audit market, which is dominated by Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Laura Carstensen, chairman of the commission's audit market investigation group, said: \"More frequent tendering will ensure that companies make regular and well informed assessments of whether their incumbent auditor is competitive and will open up more opportunities for other firms to compete. A more dynamic, contestable market will reduce the dangers that come with overfamiliarity and long, unchallenged tenures.\" The commission also concluded that companies should not be allowed to include clauses in documents that require the hiring of an auditor drawn from the ranks of the big four only. However, it stopped short of proposing that companies should be forced to switch auditors. \"We do not see a competition problem with audit firms retaining business if they do a good job \u2013 but they will have to demonstrate this on a regular basis,\" said Carstensen. The commission suggested that shareholders should be able to vote on whether audit committee reports in company annual reports contained sufficient information. It also indicated that the regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, could be handed greater responsibility over the accounting sector. A final report from the Commission is due by 20 October.",
