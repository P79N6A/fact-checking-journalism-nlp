      "bodyText": "US drugmaker Pfizer's \u00a360bn takeover approach for British rival AstraZeneca has caused a political storm, and the chances of it achieving a deal hang in the balance. Top British scientists, trade unions, opposition politicians and the Wellcome Trust have dented Pfizer's hopes of success by warning that a takeover could have disastrous consequences for British science. This week is crucial for Pfizer: its chief executive, Ian Read, will appear before MPs in Westminster to answer questions on the potential takeover. Pfizer is expected to sweeten its cash-and-shares proposal again and increase the cash element to bring AstraZeneca to the negotiating table. Some big shareholders told AstraZeneca last week that they wanted the board to engage with Pfizer, but two if its top 10 investors \u2013 Investor AB of Sweden and Aberdeen Asset Management \u2013 have backed the board's rejection of Pfizer's advances. Here are the five most likely scenarios in one of the most contentious takeover battles to involve a British company in recent years. 1. PFIZER TAKES OVER ASTRAZENECA IN AN AGREED DEAL Pfizer's preference is for a negotiated deal, which would also be an easier sell politically. Analysts believe Pfizer will have to increase its offer from \u00a350 a share to at least \u00a355 or even \u00a360. But there is a limit to how much cash Pfizer can offer. US rules dictate that if it wants to relocate to Britain for tax purposes, at least 20% of the enlarged company's shares must stay in the hands of AstraZeneca investors. Pfizer will also have to make stronger commitments on keeping research and development in the UK. For example, the Wellcome Trust has called on the government to ensure that Pfizer does not move AstraZeneca's promising cancer research to the US west coast. So far, Pfizer has pledged to complete AstraZeneca's planned scientific campus in Cambridge and to keep at least 20% of the combined R&amp;D workforce in the UK for a minimum of five years. David Cameron initially welcomed these \"robust assurances\" but now he wants more. And so do AstraZeneca's shareholders. 2. PFIZER GOES HOSTILE Under British takeover rules, Pfizer has to put a formal offer on the table by 26 May or it will have to walk away for six months. If the AstraZeneca board refuses to negotiate, the maker of Viagra and Lipitor could take its offer directly to shareholders. Several big investors have indicated that they would be open to a deal at the right price. Deutsche Bank analyst Mark Clark said: \"Pfizer has nailed its colours firmly to the mast and it is difficult to envisage it walking away if it can't negotiate an agreed deal.\" However, the complexity of this mega-deal, including the tax structure, makes it trickier for Pfizer to go hostile. 3. PFIZER WALKS AWAY Pfizer wants to shield tens of billions of dollars of overseas earnings from the higher US corporation tax rate and is attracted by other UK tax incentives, such as R&amp;D tax credits, and by AstraZeneca's cancer pipeline. It is under some time pressure to do a deal now. There are moves afoot in the US to make it harder for American companies to relocate overseas in order to avoid taxes. But New York-based Pfizer was probably not expecting such a political backlash in Britain. Business secretary Vince Cable has declared the government will show \"even-handed neutrality\" over Pfizer's approach. If the coalition changes its tune and turns hostile towards the takeover, Pfizer may well walk away. 4. ASTRAZENECA FINDS A WHITE KNIGHT OR BECOMES AN ACQUIRER Sir Andrew Witty, who runs GlaxoSmithKline, Britain's biggest drugmaker, has poured cold water on the idea of a white knight bid for AstraZeneca. He doesn't like mega-mergers, and in any case GSK has enough on its plate, having just announced a major asset swap with Switzerland's Novartis. Analysts at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale have suggested that AstraZeneca could launch a \u00a330bn bid for rival Shire to escape its predator, but chief executive Pascal Soriot is also not keen on big deals. 5. PFIZER SECURES A TAKEOVER BUT WESTMINSTER OR THE EU BLOCKS IT David Cameron wants Britain to be open to foreign investment, but will find it hard to ignore a growing number of opponents to the takeover within the British science community. Philip Rogers, a corporate transactions lawyer at Clyde &amp; Co, notes that the Enterprise Act contains a \"public interest test\", which is restricted to issues of national security but could be easily extended to other areas. The size of the merger also means that it is likely to be reviewed by the European commission. Corporate lawyers say the government could ask to intervene in the commission's review in order to \"protect legitimate interests\" while the commission reviews the impact of the merger on competition.",

      "bodyText": "What a difference three months make. As Mark Carney was gearing up in February for his third inflation report as Bank of England governor, life in his new city must have looked pretty overcast. Most of us feel that way after the long slog of a British winter and it is little different in Carney's native Canada. But for the man known back home as the \"rock-star central banker\", this particular February brought a daunting appointment with the press. A mere six months after introducing \"forward guidance\" \u2013 to great fanfare \u2013 Carney was preparing to admit to a throng of journalists that he would be watering down his key policy. Jump ahead three months to May and the skies are bluer. At this week's inflation report, Carney can claim with quite a bit more credibility that forward guidance, and an implicit vow to keep interest rates at their record low for a long time to come, have helped boost business confidence and supported the recovery. Unemployment fell below the 7% threshold that was enshrined in the first version of the policy far earlier than the Bank had predicted, but even as forward guidance phase one went out the window, expectations over the timing of the first rate rise shifted fairly little. The man picked by the chancellor to run Threadneedle Street can claim some small part in driving what looks like being the fastest growth of any advanced economy this year, as the Treasury never tires of reminding us. But for Carney and his colleagues on the monetary policy committee, new challenges are emerging and they are much trickier than a bit of awkwardness over the UK's falling jobless rate. The Bank's decision to leave borrowing costs at their record low of 0.5% last week \u2013 as predicted by everyone \u2013 was rightly eclipsed by far more interesting goings-on at the European Central Bank. Grappling with low eurozone inflation and a strengthening currency, ECB chief Mario Draghi was all but certain that policy in the eurozone would be loosened next month. The man who vowed in 2012 to do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro had more strong words for the markets. He asserted the ECB was \"comfortable\" with acting in June, barring any surprises in the inflation projections. At the same time, Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen reaffirmed that the US central bank would maintain its ultra-supportive policy for some time yet. So the ECB is getting ready to put its foot on the gas and the Fed is telling us it will be sticking in the fast lane while the Bank of England is being told to test the brakes. Against the backdrop of accelerating house prices and other assets taking off, some economists are predicting action from the Bank this year. Others disagree and look to the end of 2015. But they do concur on one thing: when the move comes, it will be upward. That leaves Britain with a strongly diverging interest rate outlook from its main trading partners and brings two big problems for UK policymakers. Firstly, the contrast could serve to inflate asset bubbles that monetary tightening would have been hoped to constrain. Expectations of negative interest rates in the euro area \u2013 which effectively means bondholders pay for the privilege of holding government debt \u2013 may well trigger capital flows into the UK, as investors search for better returns here that will further inflate asset prices across the board. The second problem is the likely boost to an already appreciating pound. Carney and George Osborne say they want to see a more balanced recovery, but a strong pound poses a threat to exports. Sterling climbed against the euro on Draghi's comments and against the dollar it was trading at around five-year highs last week. Carney and his colleagues will be reluctant to be seen to be moving significantly far ahead of the US. At the same time, they will have to navigate through the ECB's potential easing. Of course, Bank policymakers will stress when talking on the record that their mandate is to target inflation at 2% and that is how they set rates. But let's face it, in a small open economy, inflation is also heavily influenced by the exchange rate, import prices, and particularly global energy prices. After inflation hit a peak of 5.2% in September 2011, then governor Lord King was careful to highlight those forces at the time as he warned of an uncertain path ahead. \"Much of that uncertainty stems from events beyond our shores and over which the monetary policy committee has little influence. In such circumstances, there are limits to what domestic monetary policy can achieve,\" he said. But when it comes to popping bubbles, the Bank's powers are limited too. On house prices particularly, observers such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are wrong to look to the Bank for solutions. It is not a housing bubble, it is a housing crisis, and only building more homes will fix it, not changes to interest rates. The inconvenient truth for the MPC is that it is unable to prevent asset-price bubbles when other central banks are pumping the world full of liquidity. Osborne may have hired a rock-star banker, but Carney's ability to deliver is much more limited than we would like to think. Add in political uncertainties at home and rising tensions in Ukraine, and those blue skies look like they are clouding over again.",

    "webTitle": "Why global recovery could depend on China's taste for luxury", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China's looming coronation as the world's largest economy, years ahead of schedule, is probably not particularly surprising in one sleepy corner of Oxfordshire. Around half of the international visitors who flock to Bicester retail village are Chinese nationals, making the one-hour train trip from London, or using the fleet of special coaches that head there each day \u2013 to stock up on luxury goods. A World Bank-backed report has declared that the country's national currency, the yuan, will go further than previously thought in the hands of the Chinese consumer and that this supercharged purchasing power will push the world's second-largest economy ahead of the US this year. This could be the century of the Chinese consumer, now a figure of central importance for luxury goods companies including some of the biggest retail names in Britain. Gareth Leather, Asia economist at Capital Economics, says the UK stands to be benefit substantially from the spending power of the Chinese. \"China is a huge market for luxury goods, and there are high taxes on luxury goods in China, so there is a tendency to travel abroad. The UK has missed out on this to an extent, because visa issues have meant it is as open to Chinese tourists as other countries, but the government is looking to change that.\" Last October, George Osborne announced plans to simplify visa applications for Chinese tourists visiting the UK. According to a report by Barclays, the easing of restrictions will encourage shopaholic Chinese tourists to spend \u00a31bn a year in the UK by 2017 \u2013 an 84% increase from 2013. Chinese buyers are brand junkies, and the Bicester outlets of their favourite labels are heaving. A sprawling two-floor Burberry store is packed with Chinese visitors poring over the brand's trademark trench coats and accessories, while the Prada branch nearby is thronged too.And this is not just window shopping. To judge by the masses of shopping bags bearing luxury names such as Ralph Lauren and Gucci, as well as Burberry and Prada, some serious cash is being spent. The popularity of this outlet village among Chinese visitors has spurred owner Value Retail to open an outlet centre in China itself. Suzhou Village, near Shanghai, is scheduled to open on 15 May, targeting China's swelling middle class. The centre's 100 shops, restaurants and cafes will be within an hour's drive of 40 million people. And for the long-term health of the Chinese economy \u2013 and of the global financial system \u2013 it is a necessary development. If western economies such as the UK's are to tilt back towards export-driven growth, China's status as the world's factory floor has to change. The west needs China to open up as a market that consumes goods rather than just making them. And China itself needs to lessen its dependence on an economic model that fuels manufacturing and infrastructure growth with artificially low interest rates, as this punishes savers and has seen households take on a teetering edifice of debt. Rob Wood, economist at German bank Berenberg, says: \"So far China's growth has been based on strong investment growth, and you would expect that with a developing country. But China has bought a lot of machines now, and it needs domestic demand for the goods it is producing. It is going to be hard because it has relied on investment for so long, but that is the way countries move from being low-income to high- income, and it is potentially important for the UK.\" The scale of the challenge is huge but, Wood says, the authorities have demonstrated a determination to change the growth model. China's growing pains have had unintended consequences for a luxury goods sector that has benefited from the nation's rise so far, but finds itself exposed to the vagaries of the Chinese economy. A crackdown on corruption, announced by President Xi Jinping last year, has been an unexpected blow. At Diageo, the British drinks group, sales in China of the traditional white spirit baijiu have been hit in the ensuing drive against gift-giving. The backlash has also been painful for Diageo's French rival, R\u00e9my Cointreau, where sales of cognac fell 32% in the final quarter of the year to March, following a 30% drop in the third quarter. The attempt to unravel a culture of lavish gifts and extravagant spending among officials has also hit the restaurant trade and sales of other luxury goods, such as watches. Growth in China's luxury market slowed to about 2% in 2013 from 7% in 2012, according to consultancy Bain. Sales of watches, which make up more than a fifth of the total domestic luxury goods market in China, fell by 11%. \"The highly visible government campaign encouraging frugality and focusing on corruption had a large impact on gifting, which had been one of the major growth engines of the sector,\" Bain said. Brands with outlets at Bicester will be hoping that the corruption clampdown will not dampen Chinese appetites abroad. Bain estimates that around two-thirds of luxury shopping by Chinese consumers is done outside China. But the ascendancy of the Chinese consumer is predicated on more than just British retail villages and largesse directed at party officials. There is also the impact of people in China who are earning money honestly and want to spend it \u2013 and this can be felt 5,000 miles from Bicester. Beijing's upmarket Sanlitun shopping district consists of two outdoor malls joined by a 500m-long row of seedy bars and restaurants. South Sanlitun Village is stacked with mid-range chains such as Uniqlo, Nike and Starbucks. It is a thoroughfare of fashionable young Chinese and camera-wielding tourists. But to cross into the North Sanlitun Village is to enter a more rarefied world. Its flashy European boutiques \u2013 Balmain, Marni, Givenchy \u2013 stand grandiose and empty around a vast paved square. Looking at the window display in Emporio Armani, Shi Wen, a design student at the Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology, says luxury goods in China are caught in a bind. People have more money than ever, but ostentatious displays of wealth are increasingly taboo, considered the province of coal bosses and corrupt officials rather than a tasteful, cosmopolitan class. \"Chinese people only started making money in the 1980s,\" she says. \"They wanted to show it, but didn't have any taste. Now, people will still spend a lot of money on luxury goods, but they want to look subtle and sophisticated.\" Shi is wearing tight black jeans and a black leather jacket. She says her favourite brand is US leathergoods maker Coach. In a Sergio Rossi outlet across the square, \u00a3400 pairs of shoes sit in untouched rows in an empty, thickly carpeted atrium. \"Business is all right,\" says one saleswoman, who declines to give her name. \"I spend most of my time waiting around.\" Bill Dodson is a US-born writer of books on Chinese society and economy who lives in Suzhou and works in Shanghai. He says the crackdown appears to be having little impact on normal life: \"I don't see any effect on the daily purchasing habits of middle-income and rich Chinese as a direct result of the clampdown on government purchasing excesses. In the downtown Shanghai office in which I work, women coworkers are still turning over their wardrobes with abandon. They seem to have the same level of anxiety about falling behind the fashion times as ever.\" He says the reason Chinese nationals prefer to buy luxury goods abroad is because of a lack of trust in branding \u2013 and genuine safety issues with domestic products, from foodstuffs to cars, clothing and electrical goods \u2013 not because of any clampdown or general economic slowdown. The conversion of China to a consumption-driven model is taking place against a backdrop of slowing growth. China's economy grew by 7.4% in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the same period a year earlier, following 7.7% growth in the fourth quarter of 2013. It was the lowest rate of growth in 18 months, but markets nevertheless reacted positively to the data, because it beat expectations of a GDP increase of just 7.2%. The slowdown does, however, raise the prospect of the Chinese government missing its target for 7.5% growth in 2014, unless further stimulus measures are announced. Economists at Fathom Consulting believe the slowdown has much further to go. \"Our benchmark assumption is that China will slow to a rate of just 5% this year. In our worst-case scenario, that figure plunges to 2%.\" This has not dampened the attractiveness of Chinese consumers to western investors. The display of Chinese spending power in Bicester is merely an analogue indication of a 1.84 trillion-yuan online shopping market in China, one potential shareholders are keep to tap. Last week China's biggest online retailer, Alibaba, announced plans for an initial public offering in New York that could value the business at $200bn. Analysts believe this could be the biggest technology stock sale in history, dwarfing even that of Facebook, as investors bet on further stellar growth in what is already an enormous market. According to Alibaba's filing with US stock market regulator, its three main marketplaces \u2013 Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan \u2013 last year notched up 231 million active buyers and 8 million active sellers, and generated transactions totalling $248bn. It is numbers such as these that lie behind the appeal of the Chinese consumer market to investors. And there has been one telling bright spark in recent Chinese economic figures. Investment was weak in the first quarter and industrial production disappointing, but retail sales have been better than expected, boosting Beijing's hopes that consumption will continue to hold up. And that is key, not just to Bicester but to Suzhou Village \u2013 and the entire global economy.",

      "body": "<p>China's looming coronation as the world's largest economy, years ahead of schedule, is probably not particularly surprising in one sleepy corner of Oxfordshire. Around half of the international visitors who flock to Bicester retail village are Chinese nationals, making the one-hour train trip from London, or using the fleet of special coaches that head there each day \u2013 to stock up on luxury goods.</p> <p>A World Bank-backed report has declared that the country's national currency, the yuan, will go further than previously thought in the hands of the Chinese consumer and that this supercharged purchasing power will push the world's second-largest economy ahead of the US this year.</p> <p>This could be the century of the Chinese consumer, now a figure of central importance for luxury goods companies including some of the biggest retail names in Britain.</p> <p>Gareth Leather, Asia economist at Capital Economics, says the UK stands to be benefit substantially from the spending power of the Chinese. \"China is a huge market for luxury goods, and there are high taxes on luxury goods in China, so there is a tendency to travel abroad. The UK has missed out on this to an extent, because visa issues have meant it is as open to Chinese tourists as other countries, but the government is looking to change that.\"</p> <p>Last October, George Osborne announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/14/george-osborne-china-visa\" title=\"\">plans to simplify visa applications for Chinese tourists visiting the UK</a>. According to a report by Barclays, the easing of restrictions will encourage shopaholic Chinese tourists to spend \u00a31bn a year in the UK by 2017 \u2013 an 84% increase from 2013.</p> <p>Chinese buyers are brand junkies, and the Bicester outlets of their favourite labels are heaving. A sprawling two-floor Burberry store is packed with Chinese visitors poring over the brand's trademark trench coats and accessories, while the Prada branch nearby is thronged too.And this is not just window shopping. To judge by the masses of shopping bags bearing luxury names such as Ralph Lauren and Gucci, as well as Burberry and Prada, some serious cash is being spent.</p> <p>The popularity of this outlet village among Chinese visitors has spurred owner Value Retail to open an outlet centre in China itself. <a href=\"http://www.suzhouvillage.com/\" title=\"\">Suzhou Village</a>, near Shanghai, is scheduled to open on 15 May, targeting China's swelling middle class. The centre's 100 shops, restaurants and cafes will be within an hour's drive of 40 million people.</p> <p>And for the long-term health of the Chinese economy \u2013 and of the global financial system \u2013 it is a necessary development. If western economies such as the UK's are to tilt back towards export-driven growth, China's status as the world's factory floor has to change. The west needs China to open up as a market that consumes goods rather than just making them.</p> <p>And China itself needs to lessen its dependence on an economic model that fuels manufacturing and infrastructure growth with artificially low interest rates, as this punishes savers and has seen households take on a teetering edifice of debt.</p> <p>Rob Wood, economist at German bank Berenberg, says: \"So far China's growth has been based on strong investment growth, and you would expect that with a developing country. But China has bought a lot of machines now, and it needs domestic demand for the goods it is producing. It is going to be hard because it has relied on investment for so long, but that is the way countries move from being low-income to high- income, and it is potentially important for the UK.\"</p> <p>The scale of the challenge is huge but, Wood says, the authorities have demonstrated a determination to change the growth model.</p> <p>China's growing pains have had unintended consequences for a luxury goods sector that has benefited from the nation's rise so far, but finds itself exposed to the vagaries of the Chinese economy. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/22/xi-jinping-tigers-flies-corruption\" title=\"\">crackdown on corruption</a>, announced by President Xi Jinping last year, has been an unexpected blow.</p> <p>At Diageo, the British drinks group, sales in China of the traditional white spirit baijiu have been hit in the ensuing drive against gift-giving. The backlash has also been painful for Diageo's French rival, R\u00e9my Cointreau, where sales of cognac fell 32% in the final quarter of the year to March, following a 30% drop in the third quarter.</p> <p>The attempt to unravel a culture of lavish gifts and extravagant spending among officials has also hit the restaurant trade and sales of other luxury goods, such as watches. Growth in China's luxury market slowed to about 2% in 2013 from 7% in 2012, according to consultancy Bain. Sales of watches, which make up more than a fifth of the total domestic luxury goods market in China, fell by 11%.</p> <p>\"The highly visible government campaign encouraging frugality and focusing on corruption had a large impact on gifting, which had been one of the major growth engines of the sector,\" Bain said.</p> <p>Brands with outlets at Bicester will be hoping that the corruption clampdown will not dampen Chinese appetites abroad. Bain estimates that around two-thirds of luxury shopping by Chinese consumers is done outside China.</p> <p>But the ascendancy of the Chinese consumer is predicated on more than just British retail villages and largesse directed at party officials. There is also the impact of people in China who are earning money honestly and want to spend it \u2013 and this can be felt 5,000 miles from Bicester.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-436471566\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/4/1399213552701/Pedestrians-walk-through--011.jpg\" alt=\"Pedestrians walk through the Sanlitun Village shopping district in Beijing, China\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sanlitun shopping village in Beijing.

Mixed emotions over energy profits fall Big energy companies such as Centrica \u2013 the owner of British Gas \u2013 and power station operator Drax have been issuing profit warnings, and it is tempting to celebrate this news. Indeed, it should be good for the consumer that part of the reason for the lower earnings is that wholesale electricity prices are very low and this allows domestic suppliers to offer cheaper deals. British Gas's problems are compounded by the fact that its own domestic supply customers are fleeing for the exit as they can get better offers from Ovo Energy, Good Energy or another independent. But there is no cause for celebration: the shares are part of every pension fund.

But the two of us think our subject \u2013 economics \u2013 is truly unique.</p> <p>We do not take pride in saying this. On the contrary, we are ashamed. Because what makes economics so unique is the fact that it is the only academic discipline in which a significant and increasing number of students are in an open revolt against the content of their degree courses.</p> <p>The discontent has been brewing since the outbreak of the 2008 financial crisis, when students found out that their professors have little to offer in terms of explanation of the biggest financial crisis in three generations, not to speak of some of them having been cheerleaders of reckless financial expansion.</p> <p>But recently student economists in many UK universities \u2013 including Manchester, Cambridge, University College London, Essex, the London School of Economics, the School of Oriental and African Studies \u2013 have begun organised protest against the content of their degree courses. They argue that their degrees are not fit for purpose, whether that purpose is preparing students for their future careers in the \"real world\", or more broadly, equipping them with a good understanding of real world economies.</p> <p>This phenomenon is not unique to the UK. Similar movements are springing up in the United States, Germany, France, Brazil, Chile, India and other countries. Now there is even a global alliance between these student groups, under the banner of&#xa0;the International Student Initiative for Pluralist Economics.</p> <p>Complaints about the content of economics degrees do not just come from students, whose youthful arrogance and idealism might make them see every theory as wanting, and every economic policy a manifestation of some conspiracy. The students are increasingly being joined in this protest by leading employers of economics graduates, from the Bank of England, the civil service and the City.</p> <p>Employers complain that recent economics graduates, while being technically proficient, know very little about the real world. Lacking knowledge about the historical backgrounds, institutional details and political idioms of real-world economies, they end up being idiot savants \u2013 they can manipulate most complicated mathematical models but cannot translate their insights into business strategies and economic policies in the real world.</p> <p>Another complaint is that, when graduate economists do have something to say about the real-world economy, their advice is incomprehensible to noneconomists \u2013 and noneconomists make up almost all their audience. And, finally, there is the nagging doubt that the advice may simply be incorrect.</p> <p>It is no coincidence that employers of economists, who had been privately despairing about the direction of academic economics for years, started to express their concerns more publicly after the financial crisis hit in 2008.</p> <p>To summarise bluntly, students and many employers feel that the typical economics graduate today receives a training that is irrelevant to understanding real economies, incomprehensible to the target audiences for economic advice, and often just plain incorrect.</p> <h2>What needs to change? \u2013 'Back to the future'</h2> <p>Students, employers and many economists from outside academia are in broad agreement about necessary changes.</p> <p>Students need to learn more about the real world. They need to know about the current state of the world economy, the history of capitalism (including the history of finance), and some details about specific contemporary economies \u2013 why are the Chinese or the German economies so different from the UK one, for example?</p> <p>Many observers advocate \"economic pluralism\": students should be introduced to different approaches to economics. Free-market economics alone has three distinctive varieties \u2013 the Classical (Adam Smith and David Ricardo) and the Austrian (Friedrich Hayek) schools, as well as the Neoclassical school, which is today's \"mainstream\" economics. Beyond that, there are many other influential schools of economic thinking, including Keynesian, Marxist, Schumpeterian, Institutionalist, Developmentalist, and Behaviouralist. All these different modes of analysis have their strengths and weaknesses, so students need to know something about all of them, because a good analysis of complex real-world problems demands more than one analytical perspective.</p> <p>Another common suggestion is that students need a wider range of empirical skills. Nowadays students are just taught econometrics (application of sophisticated statistical techniques to large data sets). They should also be introduced to national accounts, company balance sheets, flow-of-funds accounts, surveys and interview techniques. These tools are routinely used in many jobs which economics students enter after their graduation.</p> <p>The striking thing about most of these proposals is that they are not radical departures, but \"back to the future\" \u2013 topics and skills that used to be routinely taught in undergraduate economics degrees. In the past, economics was taught as a series of interrelated debates about competing theories and the different policy recommendations of those theories. Imprecise, even messy, but useful. This approach to teaching economics could work well today \u2013 it is how other social sciences are taught and there are no good reasons for treating economics differently. But the modern economics degree is so unlike this picture that it is unrecognisable to other social scientists \u2013 and equally unrecognisable to anyone who was an undergraduate economist more than twenty years ago.</p> <p>Of course, undergraduates also need to be made aware of important new ideas and theories that did not feature on past courses. Behavioural economics is frequently mentioned, and now so established that it barely qualifies as \"new\", yet many undergraduate courses (such as the one in Cambridge) still completely ignore it. And even when mainstream economists do introduce behavioural economics to undergraduates, they mostly teach a watered-down version, stripped of the bits which contradict mainstream economic theory.</p> <p>The psychologist Daniel Kahneman, who won the Nobel prize for his work in this field, warned in his prize lecture that orthodox behavioural economics is hard to reconcile with his analysis (as in his book <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>) of how people actually make decisions.</p> <p>In recent years, when we meet people living outside the academic bubble, from taxi drivers to fund managers, and they learn that we are university economists, they often say the same thing: \"You must have had to rewrite the course.\"</p> <p>And they are always shocked when we explain that in Cambridge, like every other elite university, the undergraduate economics curriculum has remained almost the same. Effectively no change, not even marginal acknowledgement that something might be wrong with conventional economic theories that, among other things, failed to see the 2008 financial crisis coming and can't satisfactorily explain it even in hindsight.</p> <p>So here is the puzzle: why has the curriculum not changed, given that so many \"consumers\" \u2013 students and employers \u2013 are dissatisfied with economics education today, and that there is a broad and not-so-radical consensus on the changes required? The answer lies in the peculiar view of economics adopted by most mainstream economists.</p> <h2>Economics as the science of 'everything'</h2> <p>The most important thing about mainstream economics today \u2013 and a source of pride among many of its supporters \u2013 is that it is not limited to the study of anything in particular, including the economy. It is defined by its tools of analysis (mathematical models mostly involving optimisation and equilibrium), rather than the object of inquiry.</p> <p>The prevalence of this view is why so many popular economics books of recent years have claimed to be about \"everything\". Prominent examples include <em>Freakonomics</em> \u2013 probably the best-known economics book of our time \u2013 and the first volume in the <em>Economic Naturalist</em> book series by Robert Frank, the Cornell University professor and <em>New York Times</em> columnist, whose subtitle is Why Economics Explains Almost Everything (what modesty!)</p> <p>This strange definition of economics, in terms of tools rather than objects of inquiry, explains a lot about why mainstream economists resist curriculum reform. They have constructed a Kafkaesque world in which proposed reforms are rejected because they are redundant, as economics already has tools to analyse \"everything\". At the same time, if reforms involve issues that the existing theories cannot explain well, they are rejected because they would take the curriculum outside the domain of economics. Challenged, for example, to introduce to the economics syllabus the study of the actual behaviour of traders in financial markets, academics defending the status quo reply that, first, their models can already capture the behaviour of \"rational\" traders, and second, the descriptive study of the actual behaviour of traders is a subject for sociologists, historians or psychologists.</p> <p>In this world view, subjects such as economic and financial history, or the detailed empirical study of specific contemporary economies, are also topics best left outside the undergraduate course. Most (but not all) mainstream economists may recognise the value in studying these topics, but they are too peripheral to their understanding of what economics is for them to be given much space in the course. Students in Norway who asked to study real economies in their courses were told by their professors: \"Our task is to give you an analytical framework, you have the rest of your lives to learn about current affairs.\"</p> <p>Part of the self-image of most academic economists today is that the core of the subject is an established, settled science. At the frontiers of research, there may be controversy and even turmoil, but the undergraduate curriculum need not be disturbed, because it reflects the core of agreed theories \u2013 or at least an agreed mathematical toolkit \u2013 emerging from years of steady progress. This settled science can effectively be codified in textbooks, which include essentially everything that undergraduates need to know.</p> <p>From this perspective, teaching undergraduates economics as a series of interconnected debates at best risks needlessly confusing students and at worst actively misleading them by suggesting problems or gaps in the theories where there are none (well, at least none that impressionable young students need to worry about). This is unfortunately the view taken by a leading group of curriculum reformers among mainstream economists \u2013 the CORE project group, whose proposals were recently launched with prominent media coverage in a conference at the UK Treasury. Assuming that economics is a settled science, or at least insisting that it be presented as such to undergraduates so as not to confuse them, is a serious obstacle to meaningful reform.</p> <p>Academic economics, in any flavour or school of thought, is not characterised by steady scientific progress just because economists wish it were so. It is not hard to find evidence of mainstream economists being overconfident about their knowledge \u2013 think of all their declarations, in the years before the 2008 crisis, that the days of economic fluctuation and instability were over.</p> <p>Even after the crisis, some economists show a stubbornness bordering on arrogance in their refusal to acknowledge the flaws in core theory. In a 2010 interview in the depths of recession, Nobel laureate Tom Sargent refused to accept any of the by then standard criticisms of macroeconomics, insisting instead that the critics showed \"woeful ignorance or intentional disregard for what much of modern macroeconomics is about and what it has accomplished\". Sargent added: \"It is just wrong to say that this financial crisis caught modern macroeconomists by surprise.\"</p> <p>There is another kind of arrogance at work in the refusal to reform the curriculum, especially in response to proposals to strengthen its \"real world\" relevance.</p> <p>John Maynard Keynes famously said that economics should be like dentistry, by which he meant it should be a modest profession providing practical services to noneconomists, rather than indulging in grand theorising for its own sake. Unfortunately many academic economists seem to have an alternative, ivory-tower-centred view of the world: \"pure\" research is more prestigious than applied or policy-relevant research, and research is more important than teaching. So, the more detached from the real world your work is, the higher up in the intellectual hierarchy you are.</p> <p>As a result, undergraduate economics courses are designed to prepare students to do further study leading to an academic research career, when in fact less than 10% of them intend to pursue one. No wonder the students and their future employers find the economics course unfit for purpose.</p> <p>Given the definition of economics in terms of its toolkit and the importance accorded to \"pure\" research, the curriculum reform acceptable to most mainstream economists is that which proposes more maths \u2013 of the kind needed for an academic career.</p> <p>Among mainstream economists who accept the need for change, the most popular reform proposal is the introduction of mathematical models of complex nonlinear systems \u2013 the kinds of models which, at least with hindsight, might have predicted the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>There is no doubt that these models, and related research in \"econophysics\", represent a promising new research direction in macroeconomics. But that does not make them, even in simplified form, candidates for a new undergraduate curriculum. Most graduate economists will have no contact with these models in their careers; a few of them may need, at most, to understand their broad insights. A civil servant in the Government Economic Service expressed the requirements for the latter group pithily: government economists need to know how to drive the car, not build it.</p> <p>This point extends to the teaching of models in the undergraduate course more generally. The focus should be on teaching the underlying ideas and mechanisms which drive the models, rather than the ability to derive all the results mathematically. Training students how to do these mathematical manipulations takes an enormous share of teaching time: this could be reallocated to teaching the new topics and skills mentioned earlier.</p> <h2>Bad economics affects us all</h2> <p>Reform of economics teaching is resisted so strongly by mainstream economists because they find it threatening. It is like asking the medieval Catholic clergy to teach their new recruits different interpretations of Christianity, to stop teaching them exclusively in Latin and teach more in the local vernacular, and to encourage them to challenge the intellectual and the moral authority of the Holy See. No wonder it is so strongly resisted by most mainstream economists, even by those who claim to be interested in reform.</p> <p>But what does this have to do with everyone outside the academic bubble? Why does it matter that those nerds doing economics degrees are made to jump through one set of hoops rather than another?</p> <p>Reform of economics education is not just a matter for university economists. The current curriculum frustrates thousands of bright young students who started studying economics thinking that they would learn something useful for making the world a better place and find themselves learning an ersatz theory of \"everything\" instead. Cynicism about the purpose of economics leads some of the smartest students to careers in investment banking. For employers who recruit economists with first-class degrees, only to find that they possess very narrow skill sets, lack communication skills, and have little knowledge of real economies, the current curriculum hurts their bottom line.</p> <p>Above all, the future of economics education is ultimately a matter for all of us, because what economists learn in their degree influences what they do later when they make important policy decisions that fundamentally affect our lives \u2013 financial deregulation, welfare cuts, gas prices, and healthcare reform. It is time that everyone gets involved in this debate.</p> <p><em>Ha-Joon Chang and Jonathan Aldred teach economics at Cambridge University.

      "bodyText": "The embattled Co-op Group is heading for a showdown with its members over plans to boost its executives' salaries. A copy of the agenda prepared for the annual general meeting and leaked to the Observer, reveals that several of the Co-op's regional boards have proposed motions attacking the group executives' remuneration plans. However, the group board has rejected the motions, with the result that the two sides are likely to clash when they meet. The impending row will serve to further highlight the tensions between the Co-op's members, who sit on its regional boards, and the group executive which is trying to modernise an organisation that has been rocked by scandal and crippling debts and which is looking to make thousands of staff redundant. Last week the Rev Paul Flowers, former chairman of the group's bank, which racked up losses of \u00a31.9bn, pleaded guilty to drug possession. Earlier this year the new chief executive, Euan Sutherland, resigned after details of his \u00a33.6m pay packet were leaked to this newspaper. Sutherland subsequently branded the group \"ungovernable\", his departure plunging the organisation into further chaos. City grandee Paul Myners, who was until recently a senior independent director of the Co-op,, has echoed Sutherland's concerns. Last month he blamed the Co-op's structure for the \"horrendous\" losses and warned that its elected regional board members did not \"possess the requisite skills and experience\" to oversee the executive. But now those same boards are on a collision course with the new tranche of executives trying to turn the Co-op around. One motion, proposed by members from the Central and Eastern Region, says that \"in such times of austerity and potential redundancies, increases in remuneration, which further widen the gap between the executive and members of staff should not occur\". A motion from the Co-operative Group North Region \"recognises the need for the achievement of savings in operational and membership areas \u2026 but it is disappointing to note the lack of similar achievements in the area of corporate overheads and the Board and Executive are requested to rectify the situation as a matter of urgency.\" And the Co-operative Group Scotland and Northern Ireland Region says the \"development of an appropriate Co-operative pay ratio would \u2026 improve public perception, demonstrate that the whole workforce matters, and tackle wider inequality.\" But the board is adamant that a more generous remuneration package should be introduced for the Co-op's senior executives. \"In order to restore trust and confidence in the Co-operative Group, we must address the issues that have so badly damaged the group's reputation and led to the worst losses in our long history,\" the group executive explains. \"To do this, we need to rebuild, manage costs, reduce debt and demonstrate strong management capability.\" It said it needed to compete \"with the likes of Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Aviva etc for talent\" and that if it was to recover from the current crisis, \"we cannot compromise on leadership capability and will need to continue to attract the best people to be able to rebuild the organisation.\" These arguments are likely to be given short shrift by some Co-op members who fear the 150-year-old organisation is moving away from its mutualised ethos. Insiders suggest the various boards may band together to oppose the Co-op's remuneration report, a symbolic rejection of the executive's attempts at modernisation.",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of US drugs group Pfizer has tried to calm fears about his firm's proposed \u00a360bn takeover of AstraZeneca by posting a series of videos on his company website describing the deal as a \"win-win\" for society. In four short video messages, Ian Read compares AstraZeneca's planned Cambridge research centre to Pfizer's own in Cambridge, Massachusetts, saying he sees \"great similarities\" between the two. He also praises the \"good science\" being done in the UK. AstraZeneca has so far resisted approaches from its rival, but Pfizer has not given up hope of completing what could be the biggest foreign takeover of a UK company. Pfizer's move on AstraZeneca has come under fire on both sides of the Atlantic. It has provoked a political storm in Britain and prompted widespread criticism from scientists that the takeover is being pursued purely for tax advantages. One former AstraZeneca boss called Pfizer a \"praying mantis\". Last week US politicians also weighed in over Pfizer's plan to switch its tax base to Britain to avoid higher US taxes. This weekend's attempt to ease concerns over the company's intentions came as George Osborne said he would take a \"hard-nosed\" approach to any deal, but it would be \"extraordinary\" not to engage with Pfizer. \"My only interest in the potential bid \u2026 is securing good British jobs and good British science, and that is how I will judge any commercial arrangement. That is the public interest in this matter.\" The government has been criticised by Labour for being a \"cheerleader\" for the deal. The Observer understands that shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna has written to Vince Cable this weekend to insist that the business secretary examine the takeover under the government's public interest test powers, and take into consideration \"the maintenance of the strategic research and design and science base\". Pfizer's bosses have been summoned before MPs this week to explain their strategy as concern mounts over the US group slashing research spending here just as the government is trying to reinvent the UK as a knowledge economy with specialist science skills. In a bid to regain the initiative, Read talks on his videos of a \"compelling vision for putting these two companies together\". He says Pfizer's top priority is \"will it be good for patients?\" and that AstraZeneca's expertise fitted well with Pfizer's. He adds: \"Governments all around the world are pressurising the industry to produce products of higher value, with more productivity, at lower cost. One way of doing that is to consolidate and take out overlapping functions.\" He goes on to say: \"When we looked at AZ, we liked their science. We liked where their science is being done, which is in the UK, and we know we have good science in the UK in the Cambridge, Oxford, London and other universities.\" Read makes one reference to the tax benefits of the deal, saying that pharmaceutical companies are under pressure from governments to produce products at lower cost.Pfizer wants to relocate its tax base to the UK to benefit from its 21% corporate tax rate \u2013 which is due to be cut to 20% next year. It pays 27% in the US. Read attempts to explain why Pfizer had shut the bulk of its research operation in Kent, saying the decision was \"taken in light of the challenges we had\". He fails to give more guarantees on keeping research and investment in the UK, as demanded by David Cameron. The prime minister told the Commons last week that Pfizer's assurances \u2013 including retaining at least 20% of the combined R&amp;D workforce in the UK for five years and basing its European HQ in Britain \u2013 were \"encouraging\", but said he was \"not satisfied\" with them and wanted the firm to do more.",
