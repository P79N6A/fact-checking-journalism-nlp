      "bodyText": "James Meek\u2019s book on the privatisation of Britain, Private Island, highlights the perverse outcome of an energy industry sell-off that saw vast tracts of our power infrastructure fall under the ownership of the French government-owned EDF. \u201cFrance in effect renationalised the industry its neighbour had so painstakingly privatised. Renationalised it, that is, for France,\u201d he writes. If privatisation was designed to introduce the rigor and efficiency of the market to the operation and ownership of public infrastructure \u2013 with the private sector generating profit for its constituents in exchange \u2013 then the presence of EDF in our energy landscape is a rebuke to that notion. EDF is a state-owned business making money from an industry that started out under state control and is perhaps better off staying there given its strategic importance. A similar inversion has been taking place in the transport arena, which is now dotted with fiefdoms carved out by state-owned European bus and rail operators whose domestic governments lock up their own markets to outsiders while availing themselves of opportunities here. The latest example last week saw Abellio, a unit of the Dutch national rail operator, win the 10-year ScotRail franchise for running train services in Scotland. Arriva, which is owned by Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bahn, runs five UK rail contracts, including CrossCountry and Arriva Trains Wales, while Keolis, controlled by the French state rail company SNCF, is the joint operator of four franchises, including Southeastern and London Midland. The latter is also shortlisted for the London-to-Edinburgh east coast route in a joint bid with SNCF-backed Eurostar. For a snapshot of how a public asset has inadvertently transferred profit to taxpayers elsewhere, it is worth looking at a review of the industry\u2019s 2013 finances published by the Office of Rail Regulation. Northern Rail, a joint venture between Serco and Abellio, paid \u00a336m in dividends to its owners after receiving government subsidies totalling \u00a3713m. Transpennine returned \u00a321m in dividends to owners FirstGroup and Keolis, having received \u00a352m from the government, which also paid \u00a3145m in track grants. Since the railways were privatised in the early 1990s, punctuality and safety have improved from the chaos of the Railtrack era. That cannot be ascribed to the risk-taking and innovation of franchise operators, but to the billions of pounds invested by Network Rail, a government-controlled entity. London\u2019s world-class transport system is the consequence of a multibillion-pound investment programme funded by the government and carried out by the publicly owned Transport for London authority. Depending on where you stand on the privatisation issue, there can be a debate over how you describe a privatised rail system that has been renationalised by fellow EU states. Ironic is probably too generous. An ideological failure, certainly. The most tangible results achieved under rail privatisation \u2013 improved safety and punctuality \u2013 are down to a government-funded investment programme under the auspices of Network Rail. If we follow the logic of what is happening to the franchise system to its conclusion, then nationalised rail operators are the most efficient owners of rail routes. In that case, there is a solution already waiting. Directly Operated Railways, owned by the Department for Transport, has been running the east coast line since 2009 and has returned \u00a31bn to the taxpayer since then. It has not been entered for the auction of the new east coast franchise, unlike its close relative SNCF. If SNCF wins the east coast auction, then voters will be justified in asking whether, as with all the franchises awarded to Abellio, Keolis and Arriva, the government should not just hand the lot to DOR. From ScotRail to CrossCountry, the state evidently knows best. Banking regulators must stand firm Seven years on from the onset of the financial crisis, no one has gone to jail for the events that led to the banks needing multibillion-pound bailouts. The reason is simple. No one broke any laws. The court of public opinion may not like that, but it is the harsh reality. This frustration was seized on by Andrew Tyrie MP and the rest of his parliamentary commission on banking standards. The commission, set up in the wake of the Libor scandal, recommended the creation of a new offence of reckless misconduct, under which a banker could be jailed for seven years if it can be proved that they knew their decisions could cause the bank to fail. The City regulators \u2013 the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority \u2013 are aiming to bring in a new licensing regime next year that will require bankers to prove they had acted appropriately when things went wrong \u2013 in a reversal of the burden of proof duty. These are both sensible solutions to a problem that is still facing the City seven years on. Tyrie was right when he said last week: \u201cThe crisis showed that there must be much greater individual responsibility in banking. A buck that does not stop with an individual often stops nowhere.\u201d This came after it emerged that at least one director (and possibly two) on the UK board of HSBC \u2013 not its main board \u2013 was stepping aside in protest at the new regime. This was the right thing to do if they do not have the appetite to take a seat around the table of a banking operation. But their decisions should not be used by the banking industry as a bargaining chip to water down changes already in train. Regulators and politicians need to hold their ground. Now more than ever. The good times are returning to the City. The CBI reckons financial services are growing at their fastest rate since the crisis. At times like these the threat of severe sanctions might just keep any overexuberance in check. Progress on equality, but no cigar Hear that? It is the sound of backs being slapped by chaps congratulating each other on the appointment of a few women to the boardrooms of Britain\u2019s biggest companies. After all, as Vince Cable\u2019s Department for Innovation, Business and Skills announced last week, 22.8% of directors of FTSE 100 companies are female, which means the target of 25% by 2015 just might be reached. It is a much better picture than that pertaining in 2011, when Cable set businesses on their mission: then just 12.5% of the seats in boardrooms were held by women. Progress, it seems. But the total percentage hides a harsh reality: 61 of the companies in the FTSE 100 are still falling short of the 25% target. It was only in June that Glencore \u2013 the last bastion of the all-male board \u2013 gave a women a seat at its boardroom table. In the FTSE 250 more than one in 10 companies still do not have a single woman director. It really is too early to celebrate.",

      "bodyText": "The Nobel prize for economics will be awarded tomorrow and there are plenty of candidates in the running for the 8m Swedish krona (\u00a3775,000) award. Last year the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences shared the Sveriges Riksbank prize \u2013 the official name of the economics Nobel \u2013 between three men whose research into economic behaviour showed that markets can be distorted. Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago was rewarded for work showing that the market for financial advice is flawed and that stock picking is a mug\u2019s game, undermining the claims of investment managers that their services deserve extraordinary rewards. Robert Shiller of Yale University wrote Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism. He tracked property prices, showing that bubbles are not self-correcting, but continue to grow until they crash. The third economist to share the prize was the University of Chicago\u2019s Lars Peter Hansen, for his work on economic risk. This year\u2019s potential winners include: Marty Weitzman, Bill Nordhaus, William Baumol, Sir Partha Dasgupta Environmental economics Could environmental science be the flavour for 2014? It would give some momentum to next year\u2019s global climate change talks in Paris and emphasise the recent warnings by US secretary of state John Kerry that global warming is a huge threat. Harvard University\u2019s Weitzman has examined the effects of carbon pricing. Nordhaus is an economics professor at Yale\u2019s school of forestry and environmental studies while Baumol, who is 92, works at New York State University, where he has lobbied for the inclusion of environmental improvements in the national accounts. Dasgupta, an economics professor at Cambridge university, has examined the link between environmental improvements and wellbeing. William Baumol Health spending Baumol again, but this time for work on health costs, which are escalating as western populations age and are kept alive for long periods in poor health. Baumol\u2019s hypothesis in 1966 suggested that the costs of education and health care would continue to rise in relative terms, thereby creating significant economic problems. He could be considered visionary. Sir Anthony Atkinson and Angus Deaton Inequality, consumption and wellbeing A British duo. They are mentioned as possible winners because inequality is the subject du jour following publication of Thomas Piketty\u2019s hit book Capital earlier this year. Atkinson, A senior research fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford since 2005, Atkinson has an inequality index named after him. His book Public Economics in an Age of Austerity, was published this year. Deaton is known for his work on \u201chealth, wellbeing, and economic development\u201d. He is the Dwight D Eisenhower professor of economics and international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton. Deaton\u2019s best known paper of recent times is \u201cIncome, Health, and Well-Being around the World: Evidence from the Gallup World Poll\u201d in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, 2008. His most recent book, The Great Escape: health, wealth and the origins of inequality, was well-received when it was published last year. Steve Ross Financial pricing This is a more technical area and the kind of ivory-tower, mathematical topic that many believe blinded economists to the oncoming financial crash. Nevertheless, MIT professor Ross is well-regarded and was awarded the $200,000 Onassis prize for finance in 2012. The citation said professor Ross is best known for having invented \u201carbitrage pricing theory\u201d commonly used by traders. He is also celebrated as the co-discoverer of a method that reduces risk-taking when investing in derivatives. Jean Tirole and Ariel Pakes Corporate governance Tirole is scientific director of industrial economics at Toulouse University, from where he has developed ideas about the impact of regulation on industrial organisations using game theory. A former MIT student, his book The Theory of Corporate Finance attempts to develop a unified theory governing how corporations operate in the modern era. Pakes, Thomas professor of economics at Harvard, has focused his research on the way technological change affects markets and the break-up of oligopolies affects regulation Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart Financial crashes Rogoff and Reinhart are Harvard economics professors, much admired by George Osborne. Their major contribution since the financial crisis has been to trace the history of financial collapses over the last 800 years. Rogoff has made many public appearances to denounce the early withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimulus, especially by the EU. But a book by both that purported to show that large public-sector debt was a hindrance to growth was later found to be seriously flawed. They refined their research and came to the same conclusions, but the controversy tarnished their reputations. Heidi Williams Impact of technological change in healthcare markets A professor at MIT, Williams studied at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar and is one of the few women mentioned as a potential winner. Still in her thirties, she is likely to be too young for consideration. But she has spend much of the last decade looking at health economics, which is a big subject in the US following implementation of the president\u2019s Obamacare reforms.",

      "bodyText": "Six years ago, finance ministers and central bank governors gathered in Washington for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund with the global financial system teetering on the brink. It was less than a month since the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers and in the aftermath no institution, however big and powerful, looked safe. After staring into the abyss, they put together a co-ordinated plan to rescue ailing banks. This was followed by further joint moves when the drying up of credit flows plunged the world economy into recession. A second Great Depression was averted, but only just \u2013 and at a price. Last week, the IMF and World Bank celebrated their 70th birthdays, but there was a distinct lack of party atmosphere in Washington. While not as tense as during the dark days of October 2008, the mood was distinctly sombre as the two organisations \u2013created at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference \u2013 worked their way through a packed agenda that was dominated by six big themes. THE NEVER-ENDING CRISIS Ever since the global economy bottomed out in the spring of 2009, the hope has been that the world would return to the robust levels of growth seen in the years leading up to the financial crash. Time and again, the optimism has proved misplaced, with the IMF repeatedly revising down its forecasts. This year was no exception. \u201cThe recovery continues but it is weak and uneven,\u201d said the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, Olivier Blanchard, as he announced that at 3.3%, growth rates would be 0.4 points lower than anticipated in the spring. What concerns the IMF is that the slowdown \u2013 particularly in the advanced countries of the west \u2013 may be permanent. The phrase being bandied around in Washington was \u201csecular stagnation\u201d, the notion that there has been a structural decline in potential growth rates. Blanchard said it was entirely possible that developed countries would never return to their pre-crisis growth levels, and that even achieving the lower rates of expansion now expected would require interest rates to be maintained at historically low levels. Last week, the Bank of England announced that its official interest rate would be pegged at 0.5% \u2013 comfortably the lowest in its 320-year history \u2013 as it has been since March 2009. Although the City expects borrowing costs to start rising early next year, the peak is predicted to be far lower than the 5% average seen in the years since Gordon Brown gave the bank its independence in 1997. The message from the fund is that low interest rates, like low growth, are here to stay. BLOWING THE NEXT BUBBLE Having failed spectacularly to spot the last financial crisis coming, the IMF is now alert to the possibility that a long period of ultra-low interest rates is storing up problems for the future. Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, the IMF\u2019s financial counsellor, said: \u201cPolicymakers are facing a new global imbalance: not enough economic risk-taking in support of growth, but increasing excesses in financial risk-taking posing stability challenges.\u201d This is not what the central banks intended when they cut the cost of borrowing and cranked up the electronic-money printing presses in the process known as quantitative easing. They expected cheap and plentiful money to rouse the animal spirits of entrepreneurs, encouraging them to invest. Instead, they have provided the casino chips for speculators. The IMF has identified three main problems: \u25a0 First, while the traditional banks have been strengthened since the crisis by the injection of new capital, they are not really fit for purpose. The IMF conducted a survey of 300 banks in advanced economies and found that institutions accounting for almost 40% of total assets were not strong enough to supply adequate credit in support of the recovery. \u25a0 Second, risk is shifting from traditional banks to what is known as the shadow banking system \u2013 institutions such as hedge funds, investment banks and money market funds that do not take deposits directly from the public, but have grown in size and importance over the past decade. The fund thinks the next crisis could well stem from the shadow banks. \u25a0 Third, by guiding financial markets to expect only limited and slow increases in interest rates, the fund fears it has made investors complacent. Prices of a range of financial assets have risen; there has been little distinction between investments that are safe and those that are risky; and markets have been eerily free from volatility. Asked where the next sub-prime crisis was going to come from, Vi\u00f1als said he did not have a crystal ball. Clearly, though, the IMF fears there is something nasty lurking out there. EUROPE All the symptoms are there. An economy that staggers in and out of recession. An inflation rate that is barely above zero. An ageing and falling population. It was inevitable, therefore, that IMF managing director Christine Lagarde should be asked: Is Europe the new Japan? The answer from the IMF boss was that, yes, in some respects the eurozone was displaying some symptoms of \u201cJapanification\u201d. Her advice was that Europe should follow its own version of the three-arrow policy being pursued by Japan\u2019s prime minister Shinzo Abe. Abenomics, as it is known, involves more monetary stimulus in the form of quantitative easing, more fiscal stimulus in the form of higher public spending, and structural reform to make the economy more efficient. Lagarde suggested a similar package could help Europe avoid the risk of recession, which the IMF puts at 40%. \u201cThere is a serious risk of that [recession] happening,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if the right policies are decided, if both surplus and deficit countries do what they have to do, it is avoidable.\u201d Poor economic data from Germany allowed finance ministers from outside the eurozone to pile on the pressure. George Osborne said the slowdown across the Channel was affecting UK growth. Germany, though, was resisting pressure to run down its budget surplus to boost growth. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said writing cheques was not the answer. By the end of the week it was clear that the eurozone\u2019s two biggest economies were at loggerheads, with France saying it would not reduce its budget deficit to hit the 3% target set by Brussels until Germany did more, and Berlin arguing that it was up to Paris to move first. INFRASTRUCTURE One of the architects of the IMF at Bretton Woods was Britain\u2019s John Maynard Keynes, and there was a Keynesian tone to much of the IMF\u2019s analysis. Keynes argued that when monetary policy \u2013 interest rates and QE \u2013 were exhausted, the state should step in and boost activity, through either tax cuts or public works. The IMF has taken up this idea with relish, and says its member governments should be looking seriously at the option of increasing spending on infrastructure projects. With many countries needing to upgrade their roads, railways, energy supplies and water systems, the fund thinks infrastructure spending is what the former US treasury secretary Larry Summers last week called a \u201cfree lunch\u201d. Borrowing costs are currently extremely low, lower than the expected economic returns on the investment. In the short term, economies would enjoy higher levels of demand, as orders were placed and people were hired. In the longer term, the supply side of the economy would be improved, and this would raise underlying growth rates. Blanchard said it was \u201can irony\u201d, but that sometimes borrowing more was the right way. INEQUALITY It was hard to move in Washington without hearing the \u201cI\u201d word: inequality. There were seminars on making extractive industries work for the poor, there were seminars on the challenge of \u201cjob rich and inclusive growth\u201d, and there were seminars on building a coalition for youth employment. Both Lagarde and World Bank president Jim Kim have put inequality at the top of their personal agendas. The IMF has produced academic papers showing that tackling inequality is good for growth. Some observers have been impressed by the change of emphasis. Justin Wolfers of US thinktank the Brookings Institute said it was extraordinary \u201chow quickly this organisation [the IMF] has turned around. The answer to any question used to be austerity. Now it says the brutal trade-off between equality and growth simply doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Others are more sceptical, waiting for the lofty rhetoric to be turned into action. A group of Francophone low-income countries said the global tax system was loaded in favour of paying taxes in the countries where multinationals had their headquarters rather than in the countries where raw materials were produced. Nicolas Mombrial of Oxfam in the US said there was a mismatch between what IMF and World Bank leaders were saying in Washington and what their organisations were doing on the ground. EBOLA In many ways, the rush last week to put together an international response to Ebola was like a rerun of 2008. As then, the global community was woefully complacent about the problem. As then, the response was slow and inadequate. As then, the penny finally dropped when it became clear that Ebola \u2013 like the sub-prime mortgage crisis \u2013 was not a localised problem that could be easily contained in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, but a serious global threat. As the first cases appeared in Spain and the US, and as stock markets tumbled, policymakers at last decided it was time to get serious.",

    "webTitle": "Richard Branson\u2019s domestic airline dream dies, but BA rivalry lives on", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Standing in a brand new British Airways A380, at an altitude of 35,000ft over the Atlantic, Willie Walsh couldn\u2019t resist having a dig at an old rival. Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic airline had, he said, made a bad mistake launching a domestic service from Heathrow. \u201cIt\u2019s looking terrible. The fact is they are struggling \u2013 you can\u2019t make money flying planes that are less than half full. I said it would be a mistake \u2013 and am delighted to be proven correct.\u201d A few days later, last Monday, those words proved prophetic as Branson announced that he was grounding the Little Red carrier permanently. So that\u2019s a point to BA and its parent company, International Airlines Group, in a long-running corporate rivalry that has seen both sides notch up notable victories. The bad blood goes back to the 1980s, to the early years of Virgin Atlantic, and peaked with \u201cdirty tricks\u201d claims that eventually saw BA pay damages of more than \u00a3600,000 to Branson and Virgin Atlantic in 1993. From the beginning, the entrepreneur positioned his airline as the challenger upstart to the might of BA. Echoes of this persist in the latest chapter with the Little Red closure. The mini-airline, which started flights from Heathrow to Manchester and Scotland only last year, owed its existence to the same gambit that gained Virgin its first foothold in the UK\u2019s main hub back in 1991. Competition authorities then, as 22 years later, concurred with Branson\u2019s lawyers\u2019 view that BA had too much market power at Heathrow, and forced the flag carrier to give up prized slots to its competitor. But whereas Virgin Atlantic went on from that point to become an established long-haul competitor, Little Red struggled in a short-haul market dominated by BA at Heathrow, and easyJet and Ryanair elsewhere. Little wonder that Walsh, who had accurately forecast Little Red\u2019s financial trouble, expressed glee at its demise. But Virgin argued that the competition authorities had granted it a totally inadequate number of slots at Heathrow. The odds, Branson said, \u201cwere stacked against us\u201d. With the demise of Little Red, the Heathrow slots will revert to BA \u2013 unless another contender wishes to give it a go. So the local skirmish is over, but the real battle continues elsewhere. Virgin Atlantic\u2019s defeat in its attempt to compete domestically with BA may have wounded its pride, but the cold logic for Little Red was not to unite the peoples of south and north Britain, but to bring the corporate travellers of Scotland and Manchester on to the Virgin international network. That network is now pointed firmly towards the US, ever since Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines bought 49% of Virgin Atlantic at the end of 2012. The hope is that the Delta will restore Virgin to fighting weight in the industry\u2019s most lucrative swath of sky \u2013 above the Atlantic between Heathrow and the US. This is a significant month for Virgin Atlantic and BA: both are rolling out new planes on US routes: Branson\u2019s first Dreamliner will start a regular service to Boston; and BA\u2019s A380 will begin flying to Washington. Last week BA marked four years of collaboration across the Atlantic with American Airlines in a joint venture that now generates revenues of almost $10bn a year. It was approved by competition authorities in 2010, despite bitter opposition from Virgin Atlantic. The subsequent merger of US Airways and American has further fattened the BA/AA joint business: the number of routes has grown from 50 to 88, and combined revenues are up by 50%. The deal allows the two airlines to co-ordinate slots \u2013 a practice Virgin had argued would be bad for consumers. Walsh counters that customers have benefited, particularly from a wider route network and more frequent flights \u2013 the airlines now provide 17 flights a day between New York and Heathrow \u2013 and says fare increases are due solely to rising fuel costs. \u201cAll of the evidence says the customer is doing very well,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cWe have spent more money on our product in the past four years than we had in the previous 10, because we know they have a great choice.\u201d Virgin Atlantic, one of the last major long-haul carriers not to join an airline alliance, fell into the open arms of Delta, the US\u2019s second-largest carrier. Insiders say Branson was scanning for a partner for some time before the BA/AA tie-up, confirmed in 2010, turned up the pressure on him. With Delta, Virgin Atlantic now has nine flights a day on the world\u2019s key business-travel route \u2013 to New York from Heathrow. It is still smaller than BA/AA, but edging closer. Analysts say the tie-up improves Virgin Atlantic in terms of size, breadth of network and number of flights. The deal also helps Virgin Atlantic sell tickets in America\u2019s corporate market, where Delta is a household name. But those brought up on the Branson swashbuckle may feel this comes at a high cost. Sitting in his new Airbus at 35,000ft, Walsh also claimed that Branson\u2019s airline was \u201ccontrolled by Delta\u201d. This dig was a nod to a European commission investigation into the ownership of Virgin Atlantic by a non-EU carrier. Delta\u2019s 49% stake is at the limit of foreign ownership rules, but the shareholder is not exercising control. Virgin chief executive Craig Kreeger said he was not unduly concerned at this: \u201cWe are very confident that Virgin is run by us.\u201d Even so, the Delta culture appears to have permeated its partner. One analyst said: \u201cThey are aggressively managing the business for profitability rather than grand developments... It\u2019s not dots on the map, it\u2019s not sexy and it\u2019s not glamorous.\u201d Virgin\u2019s retrenchment has seen it not just grounding its domestic flights but pulling back from destinations such as Tokyo, Mumbai and Cape Town, under stiff competition from Gulf carriers. Ambitious deals such as an option for six A380s to match BA are back on ice, although the efficient Boeing Dreamliners can not come soon enough to cut its fuel bills. The 28 October inaugural flight for Virgin\u2019s first 787 Dreamliner \u2013 the first of 17 on order \u2013 will be to Delta\u2019s Atlanta hub. But with a typical Bransonian flourish, the flight will be all about the journey rather than the destination: UK electronic soul band Rudimental will play what Virgin Atlantic promises will the first ever gig to be streamed live from over the Atlantic. Branson may be pleased that Walsh feels there is sufficient rivalry to keep up the invective. But one industry observer suggests that hostility is waning, pointing to a world where few airlines can survive alone, and the deep pockets of Gulf players such as Emirates and Etihad are displacing the big beasts of old: \u201cThey are busy trying to make money, rather than beat the crap out of each other.\u201d And with conventional aviation losing its sense of adventure, Branson\u2019s space programme has become a bigger obsession. His eyes are on the stars, and his mind more on Galactic than Atlantic. AERIAL ASSAULTS 2008 Branson on Walsh\u2019s accusation that the entrepreneur had lied when claiming he had condemned price-fixing on the BBC\u2019s Money Programme: \u201cIt is no wonder that BA is in the state it is in if Willie Walsh has the time to watch past editions of the Money Programme.\u201d 2012 Walsh on Branson\u2019s offer of a \u00a31m bet over the success of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s Delta deal: \u201cIs Branson going to be the 51% owner of Virgin Atlantic in five years from now?

      "body": "<p>Standing in a brand new British Airways A380, at an altitude of 35,000ft over the Atlantic, Willie Walsh couldn\u2019t resist having a dig at an old rival. Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic airline had, he said, made a bad mistake launching a domestic service from Heathrow. \u201cIt\u2019s looking terrible. The fact is they are struggling \u2013 you can\u2019t make money flying planes that are less than half full. I said it would be a mistake \u2013 and am delighted to be proven correct.\u201d</p> <p>A few days later, last Monday, those words proved prophetic as Branson announced that he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/06/virgin-atlantic-scraps-little-red-service\" title=\"\">grounding the Little Red carrier permanently</a>. So that\u2019s a point to BA and its parent company, International Airlines Group, in a long-running corporate rivalry that has seen both sides notch up notable victories.</p> <p>The bad blood goes back to the 1980s, to the early years of Virgin Atlantic, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/02/theairlineindustry.britishairways\" title=\"\">peaked with \u201cdirty tricks\u201d claims</a> that eventually saw BA pay damages of more than \u00a3600,000 to Branson and Virgin Atlantic in 1993. From the beginning, the entrepreneur positioned his airline as the challenger upstart to the might of BA.</p> <p>Echoes of this persist in the latest chapter with the Little Red closure. The mini-airline, which started flights from Heathrow to Manchester and Scotland only last year, owed its existence to the same gambit that gained Virgin its first foothold in the UK\u2019s main hub back in 1991. Competition authorities then, as 22 years later, concurred with Branson\u2019s lawyers\u2019 view that BA had too much market power at Heathrow, and forced the flag carrier to give up prized slots to its competitor. But whereas Virgin Atlantic went on from that point to become an established long-haul competitor, Little Red struggled in a short-haul market dominated by BA at Heathrow, and easyJet and Ryanair elsewhere.</p> <p>Little wonder that Walsh, who had accurately forecast Little Red\u2019s financial trouble, expressed glee at its demise. But Virgin argued that the competition authorities had granted it a totally inadequate number of slots at Heathrow. The odds, Branson said, \u201cwere stacked against us\u201d. With the demise of Little Red, the Heathrow slots will revert to BA \u2013 unless another contender wishes to give it a go.</p> <p>So the local skirmish is over, but the real battle continues elsewhere. Virgin Atlantic\u2019s defeat in its attempt to compete domestically with BA may have wounded its pride, but the cold logic for Little Red was not to unite the peoples of south and north Britain, but to bring the corporate travellers of Scotland and Manchester on to the Virgin international network.</p> <p>That network is now pointed firmly towards the US, ever since Atlanta-based <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/11/delta-buys-stake-virgin-atlantic\" title=\"\">Delta Air Lines bought 49% of Virgin Atlantic</a> at the end of 2012. The hope is that the Delta will restore Virgin to fighting weight in the industry\u2019s most lucrative swath of sky \u2013 above the Atlantic between Heathrow and the US.</p> <p>This is a significant month for Virgin Atlantic and BA: both are rolling out new planes on US routes: Branson\u2019s first Dreamliner will start a regular service to Boston; and BA\u2019s A380 will begin flying to Washington.</p> <p>Last week BA marked four years of collaboration across the Atlantic with American Airlines in a joint venture that now generates revenues of almost $10bn a year. It was approved by competition authorities in 2010, despite bitter opposition from Virgin Atlantic. The subsequent merger of US Airways and American has further fattened the BA/AA joint business: the number of routes has grown from 50 to 88, and combined revenues are up by 50%.</p> <p>The deal allows the two airlines to co-ordinate slots \u2013 a practice Virgin had argued would be bad for consumers. Walsh counters that customers have benefited, particularly from a wider route network and more frequent flights \u2013 the airlines now provide 17 flights a day between New York and Heathrow \u2013 and says fare increases are due solely to rising fuel costs.</p> <p>\u201cAll of the evidence says the customer is doing very well,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cWe have spent more money on our product in the past four years than we had in the previous 10, because we know they have a great choice.\u201d</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic, one of the last major long-haul carriers not to join an airline alliance, fell into the open arms of Delta, the US\u2019s second-largest carrier. Insiders say Branson was scanning for a partner for some time before the BA/AA tie-up, confirmed in 2010, turned up the pressure on him. With Delta, Virgin Atlantic now has nine flights a day on the world\u2019s key business-travel route \u2013 to New York from Heathrow. It is still smaller than BA/AA, but edging closer.</p> <p>Analysts say the tie-up improves Virgin Atlantic in terms of size, breadth of network and number of flights. The deal also helps Virgin Atlantic sell tickets in America\u2019s corporate market, where Delta is a household name. But those brought up on the Branson swashbuckle may feel this comes at a high cost.</p> <p>Sitting in his new Airbus at 35,000ft, Walsh also claimed that Branson\u2019s airline was \u201ccontrolled by Delta\u201d. This dig was a nod to a European commission investigation into the ownership of Virgin Atlantic by a non-EU carrier. Delta\u2019s 49% stake is at the limit of foreign ownership rules, but the shareholder is not exercising control. Virgin chief executive Craig Kreeger said he was not unduly concerned at this: \u201cWe are very confident that Virgin is run by us.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, the Delta culture appears to have permeated its partner. One analyst said: \u201cThey are aggressively managing the business for profitability rather than grand developments... It\u2019s not dots on the map, it\u2019s not sexy and it\u2019s not glamorous.\u201d</p> <p>Virgin\u2019s retrenchment has seen it not just grounding its domestic flights but pulling back from destinations such as Tokyo, Mumbai and Cape Town, under stiff competition from Gulf carriers. Ambitious deals such as an option for six A380s to match BA are back on ice, although the efficient Boeing Dreamliners can not come soon enough to cut its fuel bills. The 28 October inaugural flight for Virgin\u2019s first 787 Dreamliner \u2013 the first of 17 on order \u2013 will be to Delta\u2019s Atlanta hub. But with a typical Bransonian flourish, the flight will be all about the journey rather than the destination: UK electronic soul band Rudimental will play what Virgin Atlantic promises will the first ever gig to be streamed live from over the Atlantic.</p> <p>Branson may be pleased that Walsh feels there is sufficient rivalry to keep up the invective. But one industry observer suggests that hostility is waning, pointing to a world where few airlines can survive alone, and the deep pockets of Gulf players such as Emirates and Etihad are displacing the big beasts of old: \u201cThey are busy trying to make money, rather than beat the crap out of each other.\u201d</p> <p>And with conventional aviation losing its sense of adventure, Branson\u2019s space programme has become a bigger obsession. His eyes are on the stars, and his mind more on Galactic than Atlantic.</p> <h2>AERIAL ASSAULTS</h2> <p><strong>2008</strong> Branson on Walsh\u2019s accusation that the entrepreneur had lied when claiming he had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/05/britishairways.theairlineindustry1\" title=\"\">condemned price-fixing on the BBC\u2019s <em>Money Programme</em></a>: \u201cIt is no wonder that BA is in the state it is in if Willie Walsh has the time to watch past editions of the <em>Money Programme</em>.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2012 </strong>Walsh on Branson\u2019s offer of a \u00a31m bet over the success of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s Delta deal: \u201cIs Branson going to be the 51% owner of Virgin Atlantic in five years from now?
