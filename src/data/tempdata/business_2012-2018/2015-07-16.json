      "bodyText": "Should BT be broken up? Should Openreach, the bit that owns and manages the copper-and-fibre network and sells its services not only to BT Retail but also to rivals, be liberated and run separately? The temptation to answer yes is strong. Read Sky\u2019s submission to the regulator Ofcom and be shocked by stories of Openreach\u2019s incompetence. The outfit changes the agreed installation date for Sky customers on average about 36,000 times a month, it is claimed. More than 500 appointments each month are missed. Almost one in 10 installations takes longer than 30 days. So it goes on. TalkTalk, the other corporate lobbyist for a breakup of BT, paints a similar picture and there is no reason to doubt these tales. Ofcom itself says: \u201cOpenreach\u2019s performance on behalf of providers has too often been poor.\u201d If that argument doesn\u2019t suffice, Sky and TalkTalk have others. A liberated Openreach might be easier to regulate if Ofcom had full sight of its costs within a BT behemoth that is about to get bigger with the purchase of EE. An independent business might be more inclined to invest harder and faster in new broadband services, and negotiate more joint ventures. Competition might be enhanced if Openreach were answerable to many masters. And surely a breakup can\u2019t be hard to execute since Openreach has been functionally separate within BT for a decade. Structural separation sounds easier to perform than, say, placing a ringfence around the retail units of Britain\u2019s big banks. That\u2019s the case for radical action and it is now formally on Ofcom\u2019s agenda as one of four possible regulatory approaches. Will it happen, though? Probably not \u2013 for three reasons. First, there is no guarantee that Openreach\u2019s service, which has been equally poor for BT Retail, would improve. The correct cure might be stiffer financial penalties. Second, Openreach\u2019s record for investing in infrastructure is not bad. Broadband coverage in the UK is high, and prices are low, by comparison with the rest of the European Union. An independently owned operation might invest more; on the other hand, it might veer towards under-investment if payback periods are as long as BT claims. Third, the case for boosting competition is weak. Only Virgin Media\u2019s cable network comes close to national coverage. As Ofcom\u2019s interim reports says, separation would \u201crequire ongoing regulation to guard against excess returns by the structurally separate upstream \u2018monopolist\u2019\u201d. The regulator might be exchanging one fiendish problem for another. BT\u2019s share price, standing at a 14-year high, betrays no worries among investors about a breakup, which in any case would have to be ordered by the Competition and Markets Authority. Ofcom may yet surprise us, but analysts at Jefferies have probably got it right: breakup is \u201ca last resort\u201d. Raking it in Barclays\u2019 announcement on Wednesday of the deputy chairman Sir Michael Rake\u2019s exit was amateurishly ambiguous as regards timing, as argued here. The Bank of England seems to agree. The regulator, we must assume, was responsible for forcing Thursday\u2019s clarification. Rake will now depart only when a new chief executive is in post and the new chairman, John McFarlane, standing in as day-to-day boss, has reverted to his normal role. \u201cThis is to ensure that the highest standards of corporate governance are maintained,\u201d says Barclays. Well, yes, but a bank like Barclays really shouldn\u2019t have to be reminded of these things. It was blindingly obvious that the Bank might think that Barclays was too light on senior operatives if McFarlane was performing two roles and Rake was halfway out of the door. Given that a new chief executive might not arrive until next spring, Wednesday\u2019s statement that Rake intended to stay until \u201cat least\u201d the end of the year was far too vague. The main point of interest now is whether the Bank will allow Rake to become chairman of Worldpay in September, as planned. A thumbs-up is likely but by no means certain. For a short period Rake is planning to be chairman of BT and deputy chairman of Barclays while preparing Worldpay for flotation \u2013 plus he has two other non-executive positions. He\u2019s a talented workaholic, no doubt, but five jobs seems a lot, particularly as Barclays is a place where events happen. One of these days, for instance, the Serious Fraud Office might announce the result of its long-running inquiry into the bank\u2019s arrangements with Qatar in a 2008 fundraising. No need to row over Rowe John Dixon will be a loss for Marks &amp; Spencer, assuming the retailer confirms he has quit. As head of M&amp;S Food, he saved the bacon of Marc Bolland, the chief executive, when the clothing side was in the depths of its struggles. Dixon is head of non-food these days and, according to the official script, that division is improving. The sales line is still sluggish but profit margins are getting fatter thanks to better buying of merchandise. It seems that Dixon is miffed that the current food boss, Steve Rowe, is the favourite to succeed Bolland. Fallouts can happen. But Bolland hasn\u2019t actually signalled he\u2019s off. If, in fact, he\u2019s staying for another year, it\u2019s very sloppy for M&amp;S to let a succession bust-up explode now. \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 17 July. An earlier version stated that 5,000 Sky installation appointments are missed each month. The correct figure is 500.",

      "bodyText": "Homebuyers can wave goodbye to mortgages at just 0.99%. Savers can say hello to better rates for the first time in seven years. Investors will wobble as bond funds dive. But it is estate agents who have most to fear. Even a small rise in base rate could send shockwaves through the property market, not because mortgages suddenly become unaffordable \u2013 they won\u2019t \u2013 but because the current extraordinary level of house prices rely on one factor above all: confidence. If homebuyers think rates are going to start marching up, confidence in the market may evaporate. Mortgage providers won\u2019t wait for the Bank of England to raise base rate early next year. They will start to reprice their mortgages almost immediately. Expect to see the best fixed-rate deals disappear from the shelves over the next few days, with their replacements looking pricier. Currently, the best two-year fixes are around 1.29%, with the best five-year deal pegged at an extraordinarily low 2.18%. These are rates that may never be seen again by today\u2019s generation of housebuyers. Should you hop over to these deals while they still last? Most recent buyers won\u2019t be able to, as the vast majority are locked into fixed-rate deals and can only move when they reach maturity. But there are the millions of households who were the winners from the credit crunch, as the cost of their tracker loans fell in line with base rate falls, who must now be eyeing the market nervously. At Nationwide alone there are 700,000 people on the society\u2019s base rate-linked deal, who during the financial crisis enjoyed a collapse in their monthly payments to just 2.5%, where they have stayed for seven years. They face a tough choice; stay and hope the \u201cnew normal\u201d is a base rate topping out at 3% (which alone will take their monthly rate to 5%) or switch now? Likewise, the HSBC 0.99% \u201chistoric low\u201d mortgage deal, which garnered so many headlines when launched nine months ago, has a sting in the tail that the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, only has to raise base rate to 1% and borrowers could swiftly see their rate shoot to 4.5%. One base rate rise of 0.5 points will only have a marginal impact on household finances: someone with a \u00a3150,000 mortgage currently on a 2.5% deal (2 percentage points above base rate) will see their repayments rise from \u00a3673 a month to \u00a3711. But a third of mortgage borrowers will struggle to meet their repayments if interest rates rise higher, with those in the south-east most exposed to an increase in their monthly loan bills. If base rates rise to 3%, then that \u00a3150,000 mortgage will cost \u00a3250 a month more. Consumer spending, always cited as the motor of economic recovery, will inevitably stall. Meanwhile, repossessions, the missing actor in the credit crunch drama, kept off stage by super-low mortgage rates and bank \u201cforbearance\u201d, must surely reappear. Those excluded from the housing market by silly prices may cheer if rate rises send the market back to Earth. But since the banking crisis, the Financial Conduct Authority has imposed tough affordability requirements. Buyers super-stretched to buy a one-bed flat on four times income today will face an impossible task if rates climb higher. It will be fascinating to see the response of Britain\u2019s new army of 2m-plus buy-to-let landlords. Last week, many were rocked by budget reforms that will slice the tax reliefs they enjoy. Will they take a rate rise as a signal to sell up, or try to raise the rent instead? This is new territory for Britain\u2019s property market. Savers, who outnumber borrowers by seven to one, should be in line for relief at last. But the banks will do their best to delay any rise in returns for savers. Meanwhile, older savers who have piled into bond funds as they pay a better yield could see them decline in value. There is one very sunny spot, however. The money markets love to park their zillions in currencies paying higher interest rates.

      "bodyText": "The Marks &amp; Spencer director in charge of the retailer\u2019s clothing and homewares business has quit after nearly 30 years with the business. John Dixon was until recently tipped as a top contender to replace the group chief executive, Marc Bolland. Dixon will be replaced as head of general merchandise by Steve Rowe, who was the head of food. M&amp;S revealed last week at its annual general meeting that its clothing and homeware sales had slipped again in the last three months. In April, Dixon\u2019s division unveiled its first rise in clothing sales for four years. Bolland, said sales of womenswear, menswear, childrenswear and home furnishings had all increased as shoppers perceived an improvement in style and quality at the chain. But just a few weeks later, as Bolland unveiled the chain\u2019s annual profits, he described the poor performance of Dixon\u2019s non-food business during the previous 12 months as \u201cnot good enough\u201d. At the AGM, Bolland had to unveil a new decline in sales, bringing what some analysts had believed was a long-awaited reversal in the retailer\u2019s fashion fortunes to an abrupt halt. And the decline could have been far worse but for buoyant sales online. Nick Bubb, a retail analyst, estimated that had it not been for the online boost, the underlying sales decline would have been up to 5%. Some speculated that Dixon had become frustrated with the company and that Rowe, a key internal rival, had overtaken him as a more likely future successor to Bolland. The new finance director, Helen Weir, and the store\u2019s online boss, Laura Wade-Gery, are also said to be keen to take the top job. Dixon, who is estimated by Bloomberg to be earning \u00a31m a year, has run the clothing and homewares business since 2012, when Kate Bostock left the post after a slump in sales. He had previously achieved a turnaround in the food business. Dixon, whose father also worked for M&amp;S, started on the bottom rung of the retailer\u2019s business, moving on to become a food buyer. By 2004 he had caught the eye of the then chief executive Stuart Rose, and was promoted to become his executive assistant. Dixon joined the board in September 2009 as head of food. There has been recent speculation that Bolland is preparing to move on. He was previously chief executive of Morrisons and before that one of the most senior executives at Heineken. At the recent shareholders\u2019 meeting he faced a verbal onslaught from shareholders including Muriel Conway, who spent 25 years designing womenswear for M&amp;S until the late 1990s. She said: \u201cI could weep at what I see in stores today. Where\u2019s the originality, flair, newness and good taste? The necklines are too low and the polos too high.\u201d In a statement on Thursday, Bolland thanked Dixon \u201cfor his contribution to the business\u201d and said he was \u201cdelighted to appoint Steve [Rowe] to the role of executive director, general merchandise.\u201d Dixon said: \u201cI have thoroughly enjoyed many happy and successful years at M&amp;S. I now have the opportunity to become a chief executive and have therefore resigned from this great company.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct, the booming high street chain controlled by Newcastle United\u2019s owner, Mike Ashley, is to hand 2,000 managers and other permanent staff share bonuses worth almost \u00a3155m. The majority of the group\u2019s 27,000 staff are agency workers, however, and will not be eligible for the bonus. Of these, 15,000 are thought to be British staff on zero-hours contracts, meaning Sports Direct can decide how much work to offer them and when. Many earn the minimum wage. Bonuses for the top 2,000 staff relate to a performance scheme started by Sports Direct in 2011 and are worth an average of \u00a377,000 based on Thursday\u2019s closing share price. The payout was triggered when the group beat targets for increasing its top-line operating profit every year for four years. The first tranche of the award, worth an average of \u00a318,000 per employee, will be released in September, with the balance paid out in 2017. A new four-year bonus scheme was set out last year, but Ashley said on Thursday that he planned to lower its performance target for the current year. The scheme had required top-line operating profit to reach \u00a3480m for the current year, but Ashley wants this to be cut to \u00a3420m. Many institutional shareholders object to directors tinkering with long-term performance criteria after they have been set. But as Ashley has a controlling interest in Sports Direct, any opposition they offer at the group\u2019s annual meeting in September is unlikely to derail the move. Ashley, who founded Sports Direct in 1982 and now acts as executive deputy chairman, believes the lower bar is fair because the previous target assumed that the group would make acquisitions, including House of Fraser, which had not materialised. Ashley does not receive pay from the company and is not part of any bonus scheme. His fast-expanding business operates more than 660 stores, including 440 in the UK, with sales of \u00a32.8bn. Underlying pretax profit for the year to 26 April rose 20% to \u00a3300m. One of the few areas in which Sports Direct lost ground was in its alternatively branded stores division, trading as Flannels, Van Mildert, Cruise and USC. This unit recorded a sales fall of 3% to \u00a3208m after a number of loss-making shops closed. In a statement to the stock exchange, Sports Direct\u2019s chief executive, Dave Forsey, said: \u201cThe success of the group has largely been created by our 27,000-strong workforce, whose dedication and commitment has been sustained over many years. \u201cTheir enthusiasm and \u2018one team\u2019 attitude has assisted the group to succeed where many other retailers have failed. The board are extremely grateful.\u201d Sports Direct\u2019s chairman, Keith Hellawell, a former chief constable of West Yorkshire police, hit back at critics of the group\u2019s extensive use of agency workers on zero-hours contracts. \u201cMuch of the comment regarding the group\u2019s use of zero-hour contracts has been unfounded and inaccurate,\u201d he said. The group last year found itself singled out by Ed Miliband when the then Labour leader attacked employers making extensive use of zero-hours contracts. \u201cFor too many of its employees, Sports Direct is a bad place to work,\u201d Miliband said. \u201cThis is not about exceptional use of zero-hours contracts for short-term or seasonal work which some employers and workers may find convenient. This is the way Sports Direct employs the vast majority of its workforce. These Victorian practices have no place in the 21st century. And under a Labour government, the exploitation of zero-hours contracts will be banned.\u201d Luke Primarolo, a regional officer for the trade union Unite, said: \u201cIf they are making these kinds of profits they need to show the proper responsibility to their workforce. That means taking them off precarious contracts and putting them on proper terms and pay the real living wage. \u201cThey should act as a responsible employer should rather than exploiting weak employment legislation.\u201d The company argues that the flexibility of zero-hours contracts is welcomed by students and working parents. This is disputed by union officials, who say their members feel under pressure to take work when it suits the company, often at short notice and regardless of their own circumstances. Forsey claimed George Osborne\u2019s plans to raise the minimum wage to \u00a39 an hour by 2020 would add just 1-2% to the group\u2019s labour bill. Before then City analysts are looking for a boost to business from restructuring at the group\u2019s main warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, as well as an expected fillip to trade from the European football championships next year and the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Around 700,000 sq ft is scheduled to be added to the Shirebrook warehouse and office facility later this year. City analysts at RBC Capital Markets said: \u201cPost the election we think concern over the use of zero-hours contracts has subsided.\u201d Elsewhere, analysts expect the group to make progress on long-promised acquisitions of rival businesses as it further expands, both internationally and in the UK. The company has missed out on a number of deals recently, and has lost the former investment banker Jeff Blue, who had been heavily involved in acquisition efforts as strategic development director.",

    "webTitle": "Greek debt crisis:  ECB raises emergency liquidity and pushes for debt relief - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Almost forgot. Here\u2019s the other news story of the night: That\u2019s probably all for today. An earlier finish than in recent weeks, as the Greek crisis becomes a little calmer....but nowhere near a resolution, of course. But for now, we\u2019ll take the early cut. Here\u2019s our news story covering the day\u2019s events: Back tomorrow to see how German MPs react to a third Greek bailout. Goodnight! GW Greece\u2019s banks will stay closed until the close of play on Sunday, the finance ministry just announced. That tees up the possibility of reopening on Monday, with limited services, if a bridge loan for Greece is signed and sealed on Friday (as seems likely). A couple of late photos: Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble at a meeting with their party MPs this afternoon, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s vote on whether to open talks on a third Greek bailout: Merkel apparently told MPs it was \u201cdefinitely right\u201d to have examined all scenarios, including a potential short-term Grexit. Over in Berlin, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has told German MPs that the International Monetary Fund won\u2019t be involved in the first bailout payment to Greece. He made the comments in a letter, ahead of Friday morning\u2019s Bundestag debate on the Greek deal. Over to Reuters: That tranche is due to be paid in mid-August 2015, according to the letter, seen by Reuters, in which Schaeuble requested that parliament agree to open talks on a third Greek bailout. The letter said the IMF would make its further involvement dependent on a successful conclusion of the first programme review in autumn 2015 and a confirmation of Greece\u2019s debt sustainability. The IMF cannot advance any more money while Greece is in arrears, and it has already made its views on debt sustainability very clear: As we flagged up yesterday, the UK government has succeeded in indemnifying itself against potential losses from Greece\u2019s bridging loan. Chancellor George Osborne declared: \u201cWe have today secured a significant victory and strengthened the protections for the UK in the latest Greek bailout and any future bailouts of Eurozone countries.\u201d However.... that victory was only needed because the EU tore up an agreement that the EFSM fund would never again be used for eurozone bailouts, due to Greece\u2019s urgent need for cash. European stock markets ended the day strongly, as investors reacted to signs that the Greek crisis was easing, for now at least. The main indices all finished higher, with European markets hitting their highest level since late May. The \u20ac900m increase in Greece\u2019s emergency liquidity levels raised hopes that Greece\u2019s banks will reopen on Monday, although capital controls will stay in place. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The ECB\u2019s willingness to raise the ceiling on the ELA puts to bed the immediate risk of a banking collapse and paves the path towards the reopening of Greek banks and the eventual end to capital controls. Mr Draghi saying that the need for debt relief in Greece is \u201cuncontroversial\u201d puts the ECB\u2019s stance on the issue alongside the IMF. It increases the odds of a more substantial haircut than has been admitted by Eurozone finance ministers. Last night\u2019s vote in the Athens parliament to accept the bailout (through gritted teeth) was also cheered by traders, as it means a bridge loan is also imminent. Over in Athens, Alexis Tsipras has been meeting with key aides this afternoon, plotting his next move. A government minister says that a reshuffle won\u2019t be announced on Thursday, though. So the up-and-coming stars of Greek politics should stay by their phones (and those who rebelled last night needn\u2019t rush to clear their desks) Hallo..... German tabloid Bild is reporting that senior social democrat Peer Steinbr\u00fcck will vote against the Greek bailout package on Friday morning. Steinbr\u00fcck ran against Merkel for the chancellorship in 2013, and was finance minister in her first coalition. It appears that he believes Greece would be better off outside the eurozone: Here\u2019s some required reading before tomorrow\u2019s vote in the Bundestag on the new Greek bailout package. J\u00fcrgen Habermas, one of Germany\u2019s leading intellectuals, has heavily criticised Angela Merkel for her handling of the Greek crisis. Rather than acting in Europe\u2019s best interests, he told the Guardian, Merkel gambled half a century of political capital to bring Alexis Tsipras into line. As Haberas puts it: \u201cForcing the Greek government to agree to an economically questionable, predominantly symbolic privatisation fund cannot be understood as anything other an act of punishment against a leftwing government.\u201d The ECB\u2019s decision to pump another \u20ac900m of emergency liquidity into the Greek banking sector means banks could open next week, after a three-week hiatus. One senior banker has told Reuters that: \u201cThey will open on Monday.\u201d A ministerial decision on the bank holiday could come later today. A vintage performance by the European Central Bank governor there. Mario Draghi deftly set the agenda for the next few weeks, while also stoutly defended his role in the crisis and putting his critics - at home and aboard - in their place. The top line news is that the ECB has accepted a request to provide an extra \u20ac900m to the Greek banking sector. That emergency liquidity will keep the cash machines churning out \u20ac60 per day for the next week. It\u2019s a relatively small rise, and it won\u2019t allow the banking sector to fully reopen. But it\u2019s a signal that Greece could be inching back to relative normality. Most of the questions at today\u2019s press conference focused on Greece. Draghi threw his considerable muscle behind calls for Greece to receive debt relief, echoing the IMF, the US Treasury, and Athens, of course. But the beautiful thing about Draghi\u2019s intervention, is that he made it sound like the most natural, obvious thing in the world: \u201cIt\u2019s uncontroversial that debt relief is necessary and I think that nobody has ever disputed that. The issue is what is the best form of debt relief within our framework, within our legal institutional framework. I think we should focus on this point in the coming weeks.\u201d Not, I suspect, what Angela Merkel wanted to hear a day before she asks a restless Bundestag to vote on the package. Draghi also calmly declared that he expects Greece to repay the ECB on Monday, suggesting that it will get a bridge loan (perhaps even today). Criticism of the ECB\u2019s actions were swept to the boundary, with Draghi insistent that the governing council has simply followed its mandate. The drip-drip-drip of criticism that he\u2019s been \u201casphyxiating\u201d the Greek banking sector may have hit home. Criticism has been \u201cquite unwarranted\u201d, he declared, explaining that the ECB had steered a sensible course between fuelling a bank run and crashing the whole system. Draghi dealt just as firmly with suggestions that he could be more skeptical of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government, and its ability to do its job. That is hardly the role of an independent central bank chief (indeed, Berlin has already got this role covered). There was mixed news for Greeks who can\u2019t access their banks. Capital controls are going to be around for a while, until the threat of a bank run has receded. But on a happier note, Draghi hinted that Greece could soon share in the ECB\u2019s QE programme, if it sticks with its latest bailout programme. In the meantime, we\u2019ll: \u201ccontinues to act on the assumption that Greece is and will ... remain a member of the euro area.\u201d And that won\u2019t be shaken by any talk of \u2018temporary Grexit\u2019 from the likes of Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. In short, it was a picture of a central banker dutifully following his mandate, and quietly steering the eurozone through a mess that is not of his making. Another tantalising development.... Draghi hints that Greece could soon benefit from the ECB\u2019s quantitative-easing scheme, if it delivers on what\u2019s been demanded. Draghi also gives Alexis Tsipras a nudge: How can the European Central Bank be so confident, given that prime minister Alexis Tsipras says he doesn\u2019t believe in the bailout deal? Draghi knocks this one out of the ground, in a manner that would have been applauded at the other ECB. Do you really want us taking decisions based on political uncertainty? Or raising doubts about a government\u2019s ability to implement its decisions? No, we follow our mandate. Was the decision to give Greece more emergency liquidity unanimous? Draghi claims that such decisions are never unanimous, as it takes a two-thirds majority to reject a request from a national bank. Hmmmm me thinks it was not unanimous at all. Draghi says the ECB didn\u2019t take a decision on the ELA haircut (which is applied to the assets provided on Greek banks when they get emergency liquidity). Draghi\u2019s confidence on getting repaid on Monday means he is certain that Greece will get its bridging loan in time. What will happen if Greece defaults on the ECB on 20 July? My information is that repayment will be met, and the IMF repayment too. So that is off the table, Draghi replies. He\u2019s getting positively insouciant now! Draghi also reveals that the ECB will change the way that ELA changes are announced. Currently they are not, but leak out to journalists. That\u2019s going to stop, now that we\u2019re dealing with a systemic, macroeconomic problem. When will the Greek banks reopen and operate normally? It would be good to reopen them soon, Draghi agrees. It\u2019s a decision for the Greek government. But we need to avoid a bank run, which would leave all the depositors being hit. Capital controls have protected depositors, who are generally now all \u201csmall depositors\u201d, says Draghi pointedly (a reference to the bank scamper in Greece this year) What\u2019s Draghi\u2019s take on Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s idea that Greece could temporarily leave the eurozone? I am not going to comment on politician\u2019s statements. I only know our mandate, says Draghi, which is to work on the assumption that Greece is and will remain a member of the eurozone. Is a \u20ac900m increase in ELA enough to help Greece? Will cash machine withdrawals remain at \u20ac60 per day? Draghi rejects the suggestion that he\u2019s being stingy with Greece - we have \u201ccompletely and fully\u201d satisfied the Bank of Greece\u2019s request (although adjusted to one-week, so the ECB can see how the situation develops) Debt relief for Greece is \u201cnecessary\u201d, Draghi continues. No-one has ever disputed that. But the question is how we do that in our institutional framework. (ie, do we do it through extending repayment dates, rather than up-front haircuts) What\u2019s Draghi\u2019s view of the Greek bailout deal? Draghi points to the structural reforms in the package - they could help Greece become a thriving member of eurozone over time. Have you let Greece down? Mario Drahghi says he finds such criticism quite \u201cunwarranted\u201d. He embarks on a long explanation of how the ECB has propped up the Greek banking sector for months, as savers withdrew their savings this year. We now have a total exposure of \u20ac130bn to Greece, that makes us the biggest depositor. We had to adjust the collateral haircuts when the quality of the assets held by Greek banks deteriorated. But we didn\u2019t cut the ELA off altogether, as some people pushed for. That would have been against our mandate. We have always acted on the assumption that Greece was, and would remain, a member of the eurozone. Draghi confirms, extremely casually, that the ECB has raised Greece\u2019s emergency liquidity limits by \u20ac900m. That\u2019s a small increase -- it won\u2019t allow capital controls to be lifted. But it should stop the cash machines running out in the next few days. And has talk of temporary Grexit opened the Pandora\u2019s Box? It\u2019s not up to us to decide who should be in the eurozone, Draghi replies. We work on the assumption that Greece is a member, and will continue to be. Onto questions....and the first one is about Greece (quite right too). Will the short-term bridging loan be enough to restore emergency liquidity to the Greek banking sector? ELA is provided to solvent banks with sufficient collateral, Draghi explains. We capped it once Greece exited its bailout programme without a deal. There were some who wanted us to terminate it - which would have crashed the banking sector. Things have changed now- we have a series of news, with the approval of the bridge package,. This restores the conditions to a raise in the ELA. Is he saying that the ECB has turned the liquidity pumps on again? Looks like it! Nothing about Greece yet... Draghi is taking some time to explain that Loan dynamics continued to improve, but are still subdued -- such as the flow of loans to companies. Draghi cites emerging markets as a threat to the eurozone economic outlook: But he suggests other risks (oil, foreign exchange rates) are under control. We would use \u201call instruments available\u201d if we saw that an \u201cunwarranted tightening of monetary policy\u201d was taking place, says Draghi firmly. That\u2019s a warning shot at the markets: Draghi runs through his introductory statement following today\u2019s meeting. He confirms that the ECB left rates unchanged. The ECB\u2019s asset-purchase scheme is running smoothly, and will keep running until September 2016, or at least until inflation is back on target. The evidence we\u2019ve received since our last meeting in June has been broadly in line with our assessment of the economic situation. It\u2019s a \u2018steady-as-she-goes\u2019 performance so far. After some toe-tapping hold music, Mairo Draghi has arrived. You can watch the ECB press conference live here. It\u2019s nearly time for the main event of the afternoon - Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference. We\u2019re hoping for a lot of questions about Greece - this is the first European Central Bank presser since capital controls were introduced. What will it take for Draghi to pump more emergency liquidity into the Greek banking system? What will happen if Greece \u20ac3.5bn repayment to the ECB on July 20? What\u2019s his take on last weekend\u2019s Euro summit (where he apparently had a blazing row with the German finance minister?) Plus the meat-and-drink of monetary policy: the state of the economy, the ECB\u2019s stimulus packages, etc etc. Despite last night\u2019s vote, the Economist Intelligence Unit reckon this latest bailout deal is domed: Here comes the European Central Bank\u2019s decisions.... And to no-one\u2019s huge surprise, they have left interest rates across the eurozone unchanged. That means the headline rate remains at a record low of 0.05%. The deposit rate stays at -0.2%, meaning banks will still face negative interest rates for leaving cash at the ECB. The marginal lending rate (charged to banks who borrow from the ECB) remains at 0.3%. Here\u2019s the Agence-France Presse report on the EU believing last night\u2019s vote met the bailout conditions: A Greek parliament vote satisfies the initial terms of a reforms-for-bailout deal between Greece and its EU creditors agreed at a 17-hour summit earlier this week, an EU spokeswoman said Thursday. \u201cThe authorities have legally implemented the first set of four measures agreed at the eurosummit in a timely and overall satisfactory manner,\u201d spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt told reporters. Meanwhile, more concerns from Germany: Despite the Greek vote avoiding an immediate default, there are still considerable risks ahead, according to ratings agency Moody\u2019s. It said Greece\u2019s fiscal strength was \u201clow\u201d and the potential to reduce its debt burden was uncertain: The Greek parliamentary vote averts an immediate disorderly default and potential exit from the euro area, but risks remains elevated given Greece\u2019s weak institutions and substantial political scepticism on the bailout conditions. The vote \u2013 following votes in other parliaments on Friday \u2013 should pave the way for the Greek government to receive much-needed liquidity to make its upcoming large external payment obligations for at least the next month. Considerable uncertainty remains regarding the ability of Greece and its official creditors to reach a final agreement on a third programme to receive sustained funding, especially given the short time frame within which the program has to be negotiated. Even if an agreement is found, judging by recent events and the deep economic problems and social divisions within society, it is highly uncertain whether the Greek authorities have the capacity to achieve agreed objectives and to abide by its creditor\u2019s conditions. We assess Greece\u2019s Fiscal Strength as `low\u2019, because of the country\u2019s high debt burden, which stood at around 177% of GDP at the end of 2014, one of the highest debt burdens in the universe of Moody\u2019s-rated countries. Moreover, the potential to meaningfully improve the debt trend over the next 3-5 years is highly uncertain given that the large-scale reforms that could spur growth are currently hampered by ongoing political uncertainty. Against the backdrop of considerable decline in economic activity in the last six months, and even with a support programme in place, we expect non-performing loan ratio to increase to 40-45% up from 35% of all outstanding loans in December 2014. Given that current provisioning levels are weak, higher provisioning charges are likely to raise further solvency issues for banks. Greece\u2019s interior minister Nikos Voutsis has said elections could come in September or October. Speaking on Kokkino radio station, he said that elections are highly likely. The station reports: \u201cIf it\u2019s not September it will be on October and it will be a product of an overall insight-not just of the Syriza government- on the broader developments\u201d he said. Asked what would be the main question for the next election, the minister of Interior said it would be a mandate to apply our program. A decision on a reshuffle would be made before 22 July, he added. The European Commission says it takes the Greek vote as a positive signal, and believes a compromise on a bridging loan for Greece is within reach. It added that short term funds could be disbursed rapidly, reports Reuters. The Eurogroup call has finished and more news is expected later today, according to its spokesman: Despite concerns from EU ministers about Greece\u2019s ability to implement the proposed reforms - Finland\u2019s Alexander Stubb for one - the EU reportedly believes that the vote last night satisfies the bailout terms: Austrian finance minister Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling has said he has heard from sources at the European Central Bank that the emergency liquidity assistance for Greece will be extended, Reuters is reporting. Schelling also said he expects an agreement on a bridging loan for Greece to be reached by late afternoon tomorrow. And here\u2019s the ECB (central bank) and ECB (cricket) confusion, as tweeted by the ECB\u2019s head of media: That leaves the German and Austrian parliaments to vote tomorrow. Meanwhile the European Stability Mechanism council will have a conference call tomorrow to decide whether to begin negotiations about a third Greek bailout: Finland has given its approval to start negotiations for a new bailout programme for Greece and for talks on bridging finance. The Grand Committee, which acts on behalf of the country\u2019s MPs, voted in favour of the request for talks (a day earlier than we had expected.) Finance minister Alexander Stubb said Finland would not accept a haircut on Greek debt, but was open to other options. He also said he was concerned about Greece implementing the reforms, given prime minister Alexis Tsipras said last night he did not believe in them. Secondly, film of violence that broke out at last night\u2019s protests: Meanwhile here are a couple of videos from last night. First the Greek parliament passing the bailout deal: The \u20ac7bn bridging loan for Greece has been agreed in principle and could be announced tomorrow, Bloomberg is reporting: After Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble raised the prospect once more of Greece leaving the eurozone temporarily, Greek deputy prime minister Yannis Dragasakis has dismissed the idea. In a Facebook post he said Sch\u00e4uble was offering the carrot of a temporary exit to relieve the debt burden, with the stick of the threat of bankruptcy. But he said there were ways within the existing framework to allieviate the debt burden (debt relief along the lines suggested by the IMF perhaps, with a 30 year grace period). Here is his conclusion, translated: Within the current framework there are technical capabilities that could alleviate the Greek economy and society from the excessive burden of debt, putting it on a sustainable path. These, with persistence and rigor, we try to make the most of defending the long term interests of Greece and of Europe. The Greek reshuffle may not happen today after all, it seems: More from the radio interview earlier with German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. Reuters reports: [Sch\u00e4uble] questioned whether Greece will ever get a third bailout programme on Thursday, a day after the Greek parliament passed a package of stringent measures required to open negotiations on financial aid. He said he would submit a request to Germany\u2019s parliament to vote on opening the talks and said passing the reforms was an \u201cimportant step\u201d, but it would be hard to make Greece\u2019s debt sustainable without writing some of it off, an idea Berlin considers to be illegal. \u201cWe will now see in the negotiations whether there is even a way to get to a new programme taking into account (Greece\u2019s) financing needs, which have risen incredibly,\u201d he told Deutschlandfunk radio on Thursday. Finland has to vote on the Greek bailout deal, and could prove tricky to get a mandate for a deal as our Europe editor Ian Traynor explained earlier in the week: And now: Finland, Austria and Germany all vote on Friday. Meanwhile the Greek bank holiday has been extended until 17 July, according to Greek news agency ANA-MPA, which is hardly a surprise. The banks cannot reopen without further support from the European Central Bank. Here\u2019s some bits of speculation about the European Central Bank and its emergency liquidity assistance for Greek banks: The ECB is currently meeting and will give a press conference later. After meeting ECB president Mario Draghi yesterday, US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has been in talks today with German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. Perhaps they were discussing swapping Greece for Puerto Rico. Last week Sch\u00e4uble said in Frankfurt: I offered to my friend Jack Lew that we would take Puerto Rico into the eurozone, if the USA took Greece into the dollar union. He thought I was joking. The chairman of Germany\u2019s CSU Horst Seehofer has welcomed the Greek vote to begin negotiations and said it was a sign of trust building. He called on his party to back the deal in the German parliament tomorrow. He told the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung: This is the beginning of a trust building, which is urgently needed after the last few weeks and months. I strongly recommend that the friends of my party and our group formally agree to start negotiations. Full story here (in German). In the middle of the financial crisis, Greeks have been buying big ticket electrical items such as large screen TVs, writes Shane Hickey. That is according to Dixons Carphone, whose Kotsovolos arm in Greece returned to profitability during the year. But the company said: We do however remain very mindful of the uncertain economic and political situation in the country and the effect this may have on our business. And here are his concerns, and they revolve around our old friend \u201cimplementation\u201d: And here comes the man who blamed the Greek situation on \u201cSyriza Spring\u201d to welcome last night\u2019s vote, in a rather downbeat way. Slovak finance minister Peter Kazimir tweets: More from the ESM\u2019s Klaus Regling on German radio, who said the emergency fund would provide around \u20ac50bn to the Greek bailout: European markets have opened higher after the Greek vote which opens the way for negotiations over a third bailout: Is the eurozone about to give Greece a break on debt relief? Christine Lagarde, the director of the International Monetary Fund, hinted as much when she said Greece\u2019s creditors were moving closer to easing the burden of Greece\u2019s debt. \u201cI have some hope because I understand as late as a couple of hours ago there were some more positive noises to that principle of debt restructuring,\u201d she told CNN in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cOne way has to be found in order to release that burden and allow that country to demonstrate, yes, it can be back on a sustainable path.\u201d She laid out several ways Greece\u2019s creditors could lessen the debt burden: giving Greece more time to pay back debt, extending the holiday on repayments, reducing interest rates or writing off a portion of the total - a haircut. But she made clear the latter is not acceptable to eurozone governments. \u201cHaircuts are not on the cards, not in these member states.\u201d The IMF thinks Athens should receive a 30-year grace period before it has to start paying off its debts. The fund made this recommendation in a devastating analysis on Greece\u2019s debts that ripped apart the idea the current bailout plan could work without much more generous debt relief. While the IMF report is comfort to Syriza, it is clear the fund are not exactly fans of Greece\u2019s leftist government. Lagarde is convinced Greece was \u201con the path to sustainability\u201d eighteen months ago. She blames the Syriza-led government for reversing austerity measures, as well as backsliding on reform promises under the previous government - led by Antonis Samaras of the centre-right New Democracy party. Despite the critical tone, the fund\u2019s intervention is likely to help Greece in the extremely difficult negotiations on the small print of the \u20ac86bn bailout that will take place over the next month. Lagarde made clear she saw two parts to those talks: more reforms from the Greek government and \u201ca significant debt restructuring that will actually keep everything together and put the country back on a sustainable track.\u201d It is yet another reminder that the Greek debt crisis is far from over. Ahead of the vote on the bailout tomorrow in the German parliament, the country\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is still persisting with his suggestion of a temporary exit from the eurozone by Greece. Reuters reports: Sch\u00e4uble said he would submit a request to Germany\u2019s parliament to reopen negotiations on Greece\u2019s third bailout with \u201cfull conviction\u201d, but still believes a temporary Grexit would perhaps be a better option. \u201cWe are a step further,\u201d Schaeuble told Germany\u2019s Deutschlandfunk radio on Thursday, after the Greek parliament passed a sweeping package of austerity measures demanded by European partners. \u201cThis is an important step,\u201d he said. He added, however, that many economists doubt that Greece\u2019s problems can be solved without a debt haircut. He said a haircut would be incompatible with a country\u2019s membership of the euro, meaning that a country would therefore have to leave the currency union temporarily. \u201cBut this would perhaps be the better way for Greece,\u201d Schaeuble said. Yields for Spanish, Portuguese and Italian bonds have dipped after the Greek vote, with investors showing some cautious optimism for the outlook. They fell up to 4 basis points to around six-week lows. Well it comes under the category of stating the obvious, but the head of the European Stability Mechanism has warned Greek banks could collapse without a third bailout. Klaus Regling, head of the agency which gives financial support to eurozone countries, told German broadcaster ARD: If everything should fail, then the Greek banking system would collapse. If the four biggest systemically relevant banks in a country no longer work, this has grave consequences not just for Greece... but also for the whole eurozone. Quotes courtesy Reuters. Asian markets edged higher after the news of the Greek vote, and European markets are expected to open in positive territory ahead of the ECB meeting: Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: European stocks are expected to rejoice higher at the market open on Thursday after parliamentary approval overnight in Athens makes the Greek bailout deal as good as done. A bridge financing arrangement to allow Greece to meet its July 20 payment to the ECB using European Union funds is also nearly in place after agreeing protection for non-Eurozone countries such as Britain. The 10,000 protestors outside parliament in Athens and the resignation of the deputy finance minister suggest the next risk for Greece\u2019s stability is political. PM Tsipras will try a cabinet reshuffle but if that fails to sure up confidence in Syriza, a worst case scenario would be snap elections. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek financial crisis. So, if this week\u2019s deal between Greece and its creditors was a Pyrrhic victory for Alexis Tsipras - given the bailout terms were worse than the previous offer - what then of last night\u2019s vote? The Greek prime minister succeeded in pushing the contentious measures through the Greek parliament last night, but the cost was high. In the 229 lawmakers voted in favour, 64 against and there were six abstentions. But 40 of Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party rejected the new terms, casting doubt on his authority and almost certain to lead to a reshuffle this morning, if not snap elections at a later point. One of them was former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, hardly a surprise he wrote after a scathing attack on the deal in a blogpost. At the same time there were scenes of violence on the streets of Athens for the first time this year, as riot police fired teargas and fought running battles with anti-austerity protesters armed with molotov cocktails. Here\u2019s our story wrapping up the night\u2019s events: Meanwhile there are still hurdles to overcome, with the German parliament set to vote on the deal on Friday and EU officials scrambling to put together a \u20ac7bn bridging loan to tide Greece through the next few weeks. Despite some resistance - including from the UK - it appears the EFSM stability mechanism will be used for the arrangement. Non-eurozone countries had wanted guarantees they would be protected if Greece did not repay the loans. The Eurogroup of finance ministers is due to hold a conference call to discuss the situation at 8.00 GMT (9.00 BST), as tweeted by its spokesman last night: There are also some doubts as to whether the bailout package will actually do the job intended, with little prospect of the Greek economy recovering using severe austerity measures without some form of debt relief and a plan for growth. Meanwhile the ECB will also be in the spotlight. [Not the English Cricket Board - there will be a separate live blog for the Test Match with Australia] The European Central Bank makes its normal policy statement and holds its normal press conference at lunchtime. But given these are not normal times, the questioning will be on what the Bank will do about its emergency liquidity assistance for Greek banks. It could increase the ELA, reducing the squeeze on the banks, and paving the way for them to reopen. Any move, however, is likely to be modest.",

It said Greece\u2019s fiscal strength was \u201clow\u201d and the potential to reduce its debt burden was uncertain:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Greek parliamentary vote averts an immediate disorderly default and potential exit from the euro area, but risks remains elevated given Greece\u2019s weak institutions and substantial political scepticism on the bailout conditions.</p> <p>The vote \u2013 following votes in other parliaments on Friday \u2013 should pave the way for the Greek government to receive much-needed liquidity to make its upcoming large external payment obligations for at least the next month.</p> <p>Considerable uncertainty remains regarding the ability of Greece and its official creditors to reach a final agreement on a third programme to receive sustained funding, especially given the short time frame within which the program has to be negotiated.</p> <p>Even if an agreement is found, judging by recent events and the deep economic problems and social divisions within society, it is highly uncertain whether the Greek authorities have the capacity to achieve agreed objectives and to abide by its creditor\u2019s conditions.</p> <p>We assess Greece\u2019s Fiscal Strength as `low\u2019, because of the country\u2019s high debt burden, which stood at around 177% of GDP at the end of 2014, one of the highest debt burdens in the universe of Moody\u2019s-rated countries. Moreover, the potential to meaningfully improve the debt trend over the next 3-5 years is highly uncertain given that the large-scale reforms that could spur growth are currently hampered by ongoing political uncertainty.</p> <p> Against the backdrop of considerable decline in economic activity in the last six months, and even with a support programme in place, we expect non-performing loan ratio to increase to 40-45% up from 35% of all outstanding loans in December 2014. Given that current provisioning levels are weak, higher provisioning charges are likely to raise further solvency issues for banks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55a79011e4b058cb5610fa2d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-16T11:07:59.559Z\">12.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek elections in September?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Greece\u2019s interior minister Nikos Voutsis has said elections could come in September or October.</p> <p>Speaking on Kokkino radio station, he said that elections are highly likely.

The yawning gap between the Chinese yuan and the US dollar, documented in the latest index, indicates that another round in the Sino-US currency war could be looming, although experts cautioned against taking the index as a stringent measurement of currency strength.

So the \u2018raw\u2019 Big Mac index says that the yuan was undervalued by 43% at that time.\u201d Currencies linked to China through local trade also enjoy cheap Big Macs, illustrating how much south-east Asian economies have felt the strain over the past year as the Chinese recovery has run out of steam. There are plenty of other factors that can undermine an index based on burger prices, which the Economist freely admits. In some parts of the world it is considered a premium food and priced accordingly. More importantly, it can reflect per capita incomes, which remain much lower in China and the developing world compared with Europe and the US. For example, the cheapest Big Macs can be found in Venezuala, where a mix of subsidies, low taxes and growing poverty have kept the price low. The Economist also publishes a chart showing the burger\u2019s price relative to individual incomes and unsurprisingly, the correlation is consistent; McDonald\u2019s commonly prices its burgers according to what people can afford.",

      "bodyText": "Slowly but surely, the demand for initial public offerings of shares in companies new to the US stock market is picking up \u2013 at least, if we\u2019re to judge by levels of activity. In the second quarter of 2015, 75 companies completed IPOs, raising more than $13bn, according to data from PwC. That\u2019s significantly higher than the 41 transactions in the first three months of the year, which raised a mere $6.2bn. Now, two weeks into the third quarter, the trend seems to be intact. Despite the stock market\u2019s turbulent performance, including triple-digit losses sparked by concerns about Greece and China, this week may see no fewer than eight IPOs hit the market, offering the chance to invest in everything from a cybersecurity firm to a boat manufacturer \u2013 and even a Chinese wealth management business. Some of this year\u2019s IPOs have done very well. Consider Fitbit, the darling of the wearable technology world, which went public at $20 a share last month after increasing both the size of its offering and its target price during the marketing process leading up to the final sale \u2013 a remarkable accomplishment. Even then, Fitbit couldn\u2019t satisfy demand for shares, which promptly soared 48% to trade at $29.68. As of this week, they are trading at about $47. Part of what made that Fitbit transaction work so well was the fact that the company had become a household name by the time it attempted to raise new capital from the general public. Legendary Fidelity investment manager Peter Lynch famously recommended that we should put our money into what we know: many investors have interpreted that as meaning we should buy stock in brand-name companies that we know and whose business models we understand. That has been relatively straightforward in the broader stock market, when picking between one \u201cseasoned\u201d company and another. It\u2019s less useful advice in a volatile market, and the increasingly active IPO climate of the kind that we encounter today, however. IPOs are a game that well-connected pros play, and individuals are at a disadvantage when trying to get a bit of the action. The question now is whether a new model like that of Loyal3, a San Francisco investment brokerage, will help to break up the cozy relationships between the big investment banks and their most lucrative clients, the big institutions who pay hefty trading commissions \u2013 fees that dwarf those paid by the likes of Fitbit. Logically enough, those clients feel entitled to get the biggest chunks of the most attractive deals, meaning that there is less left over for the rest of us. But if bankers have \u201cfriends and family\u201d (read: their best clients) to whom they like to distribute shares in prize IPO deals, well, so do companies. That\u2019s the thinking that lies behind Loyal3, founded in 2008, and led by CEO Barry Schneider, a former golf company executive. Schneider\u2019s team includes Bill Blais, a former investment banker with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. \u201cWe can help the company complete a skilled offering by making stock available to their network of employees, customers, fans and partners,\u201d Schneider says. He notes that studies have shown that investors who have a greater degree of engagement with the brand also tend to be more loyal investors, sticking around for longer after an IPO is completed than a big mutual fund manager might, for instance. Loyal3 helped GoPro attract some 16,000 small investors; GoPro\u2019s chief executive, Nick Woodman, described the decision to allocate some of the coveted IPO stock to its most rabid fans instead of the hedge funds and mutual funds as \u201cour way of saying thanks\u201d for the company\u2019s success. Loyal3 also worked with Virgin America, helping it offer members of its gold and silver elite loyalty programs access to shares at the same time and on the same terms as those available to Wall Street\u2019s best clients. The trick, of course, is that simply because you\u2019re loyal to a brand, you can\u2019t assume that its stock is equally worthy of your loyalty. Not every great product or great brand qualifies \u2013 at least, it should continue to demonstrate that it\u2019s earning that loyalty, each and every quarter or year. For instance, Blue Buffalo Pet Products is planning to raise as much as $501m from its IPO with the assistance of Loyal3, along with JP Morgan and Citigroup. My cats love Blue Buffalo\u2019s turkey cat food. They\u2019re fans, and so am I. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m ready to snap up stock in Blue Buffalo\u2019s IPO. There would be a lot more that I\u2019d want to know about its business \u2013 and its business risks. Net sales grew 28% in 2014 over 2013. But can Blue Buffalo keep up that pace, and what might happen in the competitive pet food business to stall its advance? How much will its valuation \u2013 the premium at which it is sold to the public \u2013 go up between now and the time it is priced? All such points would factor into my decision. Still, whether individual ideas are great ones for your 401k or for my investment portfolio, it\u2019s fair to say that the IPO process, one of the banking world\u2019s laggards, could do with a little disruption. Elsewhere in the financial world, new businesses have shaken up a lot of legacy businesses: peer-to-peer systems have transformed everything from lending to venture funding. New banking models are being tested. But even the woes of the 2012 Facebook IPO haven\u2019t led to any changes in the IPO process, much to the chagrin of market veterans like Bill Hambrecht, founder of a series of boutique San Francisco investment banks and a longtime and outspoken critic of the way the mainstream banks rig the game in their favor. \u201cIt\u2019s a dysfunctional system,\u201d he commented at the time of the Facebook snafu. Perhaps another San Francisco startup, Loyal3, will finally profit from the latest wave of investor enthusiasm for IPOs to create some change in the system of bringing them to market. Schneider says that companies find the model intriguing \u2013 \u201cWhat CEO doesn\u2019t want to say to his or her community, You matter so much that I am going to provide you access at the same price as Wall Street?\u201d \u2013 and that mainstream Wall Street banks often feel that they have to include him in their pitches to those potential underwriting clients, if only to seem innovative. None of them, says Schneider in an almost gleeful tone, want to be \u201cthe guy who doesn\u2019t introduce us\u201d to their client. And each of those introductions, regardless of the merits of the individual transaction, is one more tiny nail in the coffin of Wall Street\u2019s cozy little club \u2013 and one step closer to the democratization of finance. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 July 2015. An earlier version said that Barry Schneider founded Loyal3 in 2012. Schneider is CEO of the company, which was founded in 2008.",

    "webTitle": "Burberry investors approve chief executive's pay", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Burberry has avoided another embarrassing confrontation with shareholders over the multimillion-pound pay package of its chief executive, Christopher Bailey, after investors overwhelmingly backed his remuneration. Last year, the size and structure of his package was rejected by a majority of votes cast at the company\u2019s annual general meeting, promptingBurberry to mount a campaign explaining its pay structure to investors. Bailey is among the highest-paid bosses of companies listed on the FTSE 100 share index and his remuneration has highlighted investor disquiet about chief executives\u2019 high pay. Last month, it emerged that the fashion designer, who was put in charge of the luxury label last year, could be given shares worth up to \u00a350m from free handouts and stock awarded for bonuses over the coming years. For the 2014-15 financial year he received \u00a37.9m, comprising a salary of \u00a31m, an allowance of \u00a3424,000, \u00a3303,000 in pension payments, an annual bonus of \u00a31.8m and \u00a34.4m from a long-term incentive plan. The rejection of his pay package last year by 53% of the voters - which was awarded anyway as the vote was non-binding \u2013 left the company \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d, according to Sir John Peace, Burberry\u2019s chairman. Since the public rebuke from shareholders, the company has sought to be more explicit about the details of the pay package. \u201cThrough extensive engagement, we have sought to better explain the details behind his package,\u201d Peace said at the AGM on Thursday. Following last year\u2019s AGM, Burberry has discussed executive remuneration with the majority of its 50 largest investors. In a letter to shareholders last month, non-executive director Ian Carter, who chairs Burberry\u2019s remuneration committee, described Bailey\u2019s importance to the company in the 14 years before he was installed as chief executive. Bailey rose to prominence as Burberry\u2019s chief creative officer, a role he now combines with chief executive. \u201cOver that period, he led the creative side, overseeing everything the customer sees and touches including brand imagery, product design and development, creative marketing and architecture,\u201d said Carter. Bailey is credited as being instrumental in the company\u2019s success and was promoted to chief executive last year, succeeding Angela Ahrendts after she quit to join Apple. Of the votes cast at the AGM in London, 92.3% supported the firm\u2019s remuneration report, with 7.7% against. The company said its executives were subject to strict performance and value creation targets over time, and meeting them would benefit all shareholders, while share schemes rarely pay out in full. The endorsement from shareholders took the sting out of what was anticipated to be a contentious meeting. In the end, just a handful of shareholders asked questions, two of which were complaints that the 10am start time meant some attendees had difficulty getting to the meeting on time from outside London. On Wednesday, Burberry posted a slowdown in first quarter sales growth, partly reflecting a further deceleration in the Hong Kong market, sending its shares down by as much as 4%.

      "body": "<p>Burberry has avoided another embarrassing confrontation with shareholders over the multimillion-pound pay package of its chief executive, Christopher Bailey, after investors overwhelmingly backed his remuneration.</p> <p>Last year, the size and structure of his package was rejected by a majority of votes cast at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/11/burberry-shareholders-revolt-christian-bailey-pay-package\">company\u2019s annual general meeting</a>, promptingBurberry to mount a campaign explaining its pay structure to investors.</p> <p>Bailey is among the highest-paid bosses of companies listed on the FTSE 100 share index and his remuneration has highlighted investor disquiet about chief executives\u2019 high pay. </p> <p>Last month, it emerged that the fashion designer, who was put in charge of the luxury label last year, could be given shares <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jun/08/burberry-christopher-bailey-50m-shares-salary\">worth up to \u00a350m</a> from free handouts and stock awarded for bonuses over the coming years.<br></p> <p>For the 2014-15 financial year he received \u00a37.9m, comprising a salary of \u00a31m, an allowance of \u00a3424,000, \u00a3303,000 in pension payments, an annual bonus of \u00a31.8m and \u00a34.4m from a long-term incentive plan.</p> <p>The rejection of his pay package last year by 53% of the voters - which was awarded anyway as the vote was non-binding \u2013 left the company \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d, according to Sir John Peace, Burberry\u2019s chairman.</p> <p>Since the public rebuke from shareholders, the company has sought to be more explicit about the details of the pay package. \u201cThrough extensive engagement, we have sought to better explain the details behind his package,\u201d Peace said at the AGM on Thursday. Following last year\u2019s AGM, Burberry has discussed executive remuneration with the majority of its 50 largest investors. </p> <p>In a letter to shareholders last month, non-executive director Ian Carter, who chairs Burberry\u2019s remuneration committee, described Bailey\u2019s importance to the company in the 14 years before he was installed as chief executive. Bailey rose to prominence as Burberry\u2019s chief creative officer, a role he now combines with chief executive. </p> <p>\u201cOver that period, he led the creative side, overseeing everything the customer sees and touches including brand imagery, product design and development, creative marketing and architecture,\u201d said Carter.<br></p> <p>Bailey is credited as being instrumental in the company\u2019s success and was promoted to chief executive last year, succeeding Angela Ahrendts after she <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/15/burberry-angela-ahrendts-new-job-apple\">quit to join Apple</a>.</p> <p> Of the votes cast at the AGM in London, 92.3% supported the firm\u2019s remuneration report, with 7.7% against. </p> <p>The company said its executives were subject to strict performance and value creation targets over time, and meeting them would benefit all shareholders, while share schemes rarely pay out in full. <br></p> <p>The endorsement from shareholders took the sting out of what was anticipated to be a contentious meeting. In the end, just a handful of shareholders asked questions, two of which were complaints that the 10am start time meant some attendees had difficulty getting to the meeting on time from outside London.<br></p> <p>On Wednesday, Burberry posted a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/15/burberry-shares-drop-as-sales-in-hong-kong-continue-to-fall\">slowdown in first quarter sales growth</a>, partly reflecting a further deceleration in the Hong Kong market, sending its shares down by as much as 4%. Hong Kong makes up about 10% of Burberry\u2019s revenues and the group estimates that Chinese customers, including those travelling abroad, account for up to 40% of sales.</p> <p>Hong Kong sales had been hit by a drop in visitors from the Chinese mainland because of tensions over reforming how the China-controlled territory will elect its next leader.

      "bodyText": "Second-quarter earnings at Goldman Sachs have been almost cut in half after the bank set aside $1.45bn (\u00a3930m) for legal costs connected with the potential mis-selling of mortgage bonds. The New York-based financial giant reported net income of $1.05bn (\u00a3670m) \u2013 down from $2.04bn (\u00a31.3bn) for the same period last year \u2013 as it continues talks with the US Department of Justice over a possible settlement. Without the cash set aside for the mortgage problem, an issue which has also beset many of its competitors, Goldman would have easily beaten analysts\u2019 expectations with an earnings per share over the three-month period of $4.75. \u201cWe are pleased with our performance for the quarter,\u201d said Lloyd C Blankfein, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive. \u201cWhile uncertainty in the EU weighed on investors\u2019 level of conviction, many of our businesses continued to benefit from generally improving economic conditions and healthy client activity.\u201d Shares in Goldman rose slightly to $212.96 in New York in early trading after the figures were announced helping the company to consolidate a near 10% rise in its stock price this year. Goldman said its investment banking arm produced net revenues of $2.02bn, 13% higher than the second quarter of 2014 and 6% up on the first three months of this year. The investment management division reported net revenues of $1.65bn (\u00a31bn), its second highest quarterly performance. It now boasts that assets under its supervision are at record levels. Revenue from Goldman\u2019s trading division was $3.6bn (\u00a32.3bn) in the quarter, down 6% from $3.83bn (\u00a32.5bn) in the same period a year ago. Goldman said it had paid out $3.81bn over the quarter in pay and benefits including salaries and bonuses. Bankers at Goldman were paid an average of $373,265 (\u00a3245,500) in 2014 after profits at the highest profile firm on Wall Street rose 5%. The company now has just under 35,000 staff worldwide, roughly 2,500 more than this time last year. There has been mounting speculation that the bank is homing in on a final settlement over the alleged mortgage mis-selling in the run up to the financial crisis that could be as high as $3bn in total. Goldman had already set aside almost $1bn over the last 18 months.",

It is similar to the popular supermarkets\u2019 discounted wine offers which make it impossible to know the \u201creal\u201d price. The consumer group Which? has been slogging away for seven years to end the ubiquitous \u201cdodgy multi-buys, shrinking products and baffling offers\u201d, with help from eagle-eyed Guardian readers who, through our own campaign, have provided evidence of hundreds of bizarre deals. That culminated in it lodging a super-complaint in April with theCompetition and Markets Authority, which on Thursday published its long-awaited response. Ducking the opportunity to launch a full investigation into the issue - and not even naming and shaming the worst offenders - the CMA instead published a whitewash of a report which, while admitting there was evidence of \u201cpoor practice that could confuse or mislead shoppers\u201d, concluded this was not on a significant scale. However, it admitted more could be done to simplify the way individual items were priced, particularly with complex unit pricing. The unit price is the price by weight or volume that allows shoppers to compare the true cost of items, even if they come in different sizes. Its solution to the problem is limp-wristed, to say the least. The CMA will beef up compliance - fines are payable when consumer law is broken - improve clarity for shoppers and simplify regulations. Bafflingly, it seems to be relying on regional trading standards \u2013 services that have been slashed to ribbons as a result of local council funding cuts \u2013 to co-ordinate complaints and uphold consumer protection. We\u2019ve been here before, of course, in the days of regulation by the now defunct Office of Fair Trading. An invaluable opportunity to finally say \u201cbogof\u201d to dodgy pricing deals seems to have been missed.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "J\u00fcrgen Habermas, one of the intellectual figureheads of European integration, has launched a withering attack on the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, accusing her of \u201cgambling away\u201d the efforts of previous generations to rebuild the country\u2019s postwar reputation with her hardline stance on Greece. Speaking about the bailout deal for the first time since it was presented on Monday, the philosopher and sociologist said the German chancellor had effectively carried out \u201can act of punishment\u201d against the leftwing government of Alexis Tsipras. \u201cI fear that the German government, including its social democratic faction, have gambled away in one night all the political capital that a better Germany had accumulated in half a century,\u201d he told the Guardian. Previous German governments, he said, had displayed \u201cgreater political sensitivity and a post-national mentality\u201d. Habermas, widely considered one of the most influential contemporary European intellectuals, said that by threatening Greece with an exit from the eurozone over the course of the negotiations, Germany had \u201cunashamedly revealed itself as Europe\u2019s chief disciplinarian and for the first time openly made a claim for German hegemony in Europe.\u201d The outcome of the negotiations between Greece and the other eurozone member states, he said, did \u201cnot make sense in economic terms because of the toxic mixture of necessary structural reforms of state and economy with further neoliberal impositions that will completely discourage an exhausted Greek population and kill any impetus to growth.\u201d Habermas added: \u201cForcing the Greek government to agree to an economically questionable, predominantly symbolic privatisation fund cannot be understood as anything other an act of punishment against a leftwing government.\u201d The D\u00fcsseldorf-born philosopher, a former assistant of the prominent Frankfurt School theorist Theodor Adorno, rose to prominence during the student protests in the late 1960s. His works on the establishment of a pan-European political and cultural identity, such as Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, went on to influence and shape policy debate around the European Union. At the start of the millennium, Habermas was one of the leading drivers behind calls for a European constitution. Recently, the 86-year-old has aggressively criticised Merkel\u2019s leadership in Europe in books such as The Lure of Technocracy, while also coming under criticism himself. In 2013, Habermas clashed in a series of articles with another influential German leftwing intellectual, sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, who has identified the kind of European federalism espoused by Habermas as the root of the continent\u2019s crisis. Habermas told the Guardian that he agreed with many of his critics\u2019 main points. \u201cStreeck and I also share the view that this technocratic hollowing out of democracy is the result of a neoliberal pattern of market-deregulation policies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe balance between politics and the market has got out of sync, at the cost of the welfare state. \u201cWhere we differ is in terms of the consequences to be drawn from this predicament. I do not see how a return to nation states that have to be run like big corporations in a global market can counter the tendency towards de-democratisation and growing social inequality \u2013 something that we also see in Great Britain, by the way. \u201cSuch tendencies can only be countered, if at all, by a change in political direction, brought about by democratic majorities in a more strongly integrated \u2018core Europe\u2019. The currency union must gain the capacity to act at the supra-national level. In view of the chaotic political process triggered by the crisis in Greece, we can no longer afford to ignore the limits of the present method of intergovernmental compromise.\u201d Habermas argued that Europe was \u201cstuck in a political trap\u201d. \u201cWithout a common financial and economic policy, the national economies of pseudo-sovereign member states will continue to drift apart in terms of productivity. No political community can sustain such tension in the long run,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, by focusing on avoidance of open conflict, the EU\u2019s institutions are preventing necessary political initiatives for expanding the currency union into a political union. Only the government leaders assembled in the European council are in the position to act, but precisely they are the ones who are unable to act in the interest of a joint European community because they think mainly of their national electorate.\u201d",

In 2013, Habermas clashed in a series of articles with another influential German leftwing intellectual, sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, who has identified the kind of European federalism espoused by Habermas as the root of the continent\u2019s crisis.</p> <p>Habermas told the Guardian that he agreed with many of his critics\u2019 main points. \u201cStreeck and I also share the view that this technocratic hollowing out of democracy is the result of a neoliberal pattern of market-deregulation policies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe balance between politics and the market has got out of sync, at the cost of the welfare state.</p> <p>\u201cWhere we differ is in terms of the consequences to be drawn from this predicament. I do not see how a return to nation states that have to be run like big corporations in a global market can counter the tendency towards de-democratisation and growing social inequality \u2013 something that we also see in Great Britain, by the way. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/16/jurgen-habermas-eu-greece-debt-deal\">J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s verdict on the EU/Greece debt deal \u2013 full transcript | Philip Oltermann</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSuch tendencies can only be countered, if at all, by a change in political direction, brought about by democratic majorities in a more strongly integrated \u2018core Europe\u2019.

In view of the chaotic political process triggered by the crisis in Greece, we can no longer afford to ignore the limits of the present method of intergovernmental compromise.\u201d</p> <p>Habermas argued that Europe was \u201cstuck in a political trap\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWithout a common financial and economic policy, the national economies of pseudo-sovereign member states will continue to drift apart in terms of productivity. No political community can sustain such tension in the long run,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, by focusing on avoidance of open conflict, the EU\u2019s institutions are preventing necessary political initiatives for expanding the currency union into a political union. Only the government leaders assembled in the European council are in the position to act, but precisely they are the ones who are unable to act in the interest of a joint European community because they think mainly of their national electorate.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The competition regulator has criticised the UK\u2019s leading supermarkets over their pricing, after a three-month inquiry uncovered evidence of \u201cpoor practice that could confuse or mislead shoppers\u201d. The Competition and Markets Authority stopped short of a full-blown market investigation but has announced a series of recommendations to bring more clarity to pricing and promotions to the grocery sector. It plans to work with businesses to cut out potentially misleading promotional practices such as \u201cwas/now\u201d offers, where a product is on sale at a discounted price for longer than the higher price applied. It also wants guidelines to be issued to supermarkets and has published its own at-a-glance guidance for consumers. The investigation by the CMA was launched following a \u201csuper-complaint\u201d lodged by the consumer group Which? in April, which claimed supermarkets had duped shoppers out of hundreds of millions of pounds through misleading pricing tactics. Which? submitted a dossier setting out details of \u201cdodgy multi-buys, shrinking products and baffling sales offers\u201d to the authority, saying retailers were creating the illusion of savings, with 40% of groceries sold on promotion. Supermarkets were fooling shoppers into choosing products they might not have bought if they knew the full facts, it complained. The supermarket sector was worth an estimated \u00a3148bn - 178bn to the UK economy in 2014. In its formal response to the super-complaint, the CMA said the problems raised by the investigation were \u201cnot occurring in large numbers across the whole sector\u201d and that retailers were generally taking compliance seriously. But it admitted more could be done to reduce the complexity in the way individual items were priced, particularly with complex \u2018unit pricing\u2019. Nisha Arora, the CMA\u2019s senior director, consumer, said: \u201cWe welcomed the super-complaint, which presented us with information that demanded closer inspection. We have gathered and examined a great deal of further evidence over the past three months and are now announcing what further action we are taking and recommending others to take. \u201cWe have found that, whilst supermarkets want to comply with the law and shoppers enjoy a wide range of choices, with an estimated 40% of grocery spending being on items on promotion, there are still areas of poor practice that could confuse or mislead shoppers. So we are recommending further action to improve compliance and ensure that shoppers have clear, accurate information.\u201d Richard Lloyd, the executive director of Which?, said: \u201cThe CMA\u2019s report confirms what our research over many years has repeatedly highlighted: there are hundreds of misleading offers on the shelves every day that do not comply with the rules.This puts supermarkets on notice to clean up their pricing practices or face legal action. \u201cGiven the findings, we now expect to see urgent enforcement action from the CMA. The government must also quickly strengthen the rules so that retailers have no more excuses. As a result of our super-complaint, if all the changes are implemented widely, this will be good for consumers, competition and, ultimately, the economy.\u201d The CMA has been in close contact with retailers cited in the dossier, asking them for explanations for the misleading pricing and promotions. For the first time in its history, it has used social media including Twitter and Facebook to get more consumer and focus group feedback. The right to make a super-complaint to the CMA or an industry regulator is limited to a small number of consumer bodies such as Which? and Energywatch. After Which? submitted its dossier to the CMA, the regulator had 90 days in which to respond. Which? said more than 120,000 consumers had signed a petition supporting the super-complaint and urging the CMA to take action. This is only the sixth time Which? has used its super-complaint power since it was granted the right in 2002. It last issued a super-complaint in 2011 when it asked the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to investigate excessive credit and debit card surcharges. The OFT upheld its complaint. A decade ago Citizens Advice helped bring the payment protection insurance scandal to public attention by lodging a super-complaint with the now-defunct Office of Fair Trading.",

    "webTitle": "Australian dollar slumps to new six-year low as greenback strengthens", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Australian dollar has fallen to a new six-year low as the US greenback strengthened and continued uncertainty about the Chinese economy darkened the outlook for resource-led economies. The currency hit a daily low of 73.50 US cents on Thursday afternoon before recovering to US73.77, a steep fall from US74.72c 24 hours earlier. The Australian dollar came under pressure when upbeat Chinese growth data failed to prevent a slide on China\u2019s equity markets, renewing fears about the state of the world\u2019s second biggest economy and Australia\u2019s biggest export market. CommSec chief economist Craig James said the Aussie could fall even further. \u201cWe\u2019re now looking at US72c by the end of the year and US70c by March and June of next year,\u201d he said. The US dollar picked up overnight after the chair of the US Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, reiterated her forecast of an increase in interest rates by the end of 2015. \u201cIf the economy evolves as we expect, economic conditions likely would make it appropriate at some point this year to raise the federal funds rate,\u201d she told Congress. She said the Fed was watching the situation in Greece as well as the stock market turmoil in China. The goings-on in Greece and China \u201care not new\u201d, Yellen said on Wednesday, indicating that the situation abroad had yet to force the Federal Reserve to reconsider its plan to raise interest rates later this year. The Bank of Canada cut its benchmark rate, for the second time this year, by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.5%. In response, the Canadian dollar plunged to a post-recession low of 77.29 US cents. The bank said the economy had contracted in the first half of 2015. \u201cThe global economy remains fragile and is being dragged down by forces beyond our borders such as global oil prices, the European debt crisis and China\u2019s economic slowdown,\u201d a spokesman for the prime minister, Stephen Harper, said. The Canadian economy, which relies heavily on resource exports, is often compared to Australia\u2019s and the prospect of more monetary stimulus from Ottawa heaped pressure on the Australian dollar. The New Zealand dollar also suffered. The Australian stock market had a better day, however, closing up for the third day running with a collective sigh of relief from investors after the Greek parliament approved that nation\u2019s bail-out conditions.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m going to stop the liveblog now, although we\u2019ll be back if here are any major developments. Here\u2019s out latest news story: We\u2019ll launch a new one in a few hours. Good night! GW Another hint that Tsipras will shake up his government on Thursday: A late newsflash - a government spokesman has said that the priority is to complete the bailout, rather than worry about internal divisions. The scale of the rebellion tonight suggests that Greece could require a unity government soon. Writing before the vote,Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group predicted Tsipras would lose his majority: Although opposition parties have been signaling opposition to join such an administration, especially at the leadership level (no political leaders in Greece want to be responsible for implementing what is a very tough deal, even if they accept this was the only option to avoid GREXIT), this may prove to be the only way possible way forward if Greece is indeed to secure a third bailout. And while Tsipras has again reiterated the fact he does not want to head such an administration, our basecase for now, his premiership might be the only way to secure the support of Syriza MPs necessary to form it. News of the Greek vote helped to push shares higher in Asia. The main indices are all up in early trading, on relief that a bailout had moved another step closer. Although Syriza\u2019s MPs were divided over whether to back the bailout package, they were united by something else - fatigue. There were some tired faces as members exited the chamber: After voting no, energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis also indicated he would quit if Alexis Tsipras asked him to. He told reporters: \u201cIf at any point my resignation is sought it would be at the disposal of the (Prime Minister).\u201d \u201cWe are lawmakers of this government, we support it wholeheartedly. We support Syriza in government and we support the Prime Minister. We don\u2019t support the bailout.\u201d That also suggests Tsipras\u2019s government isn\u2019t in immediate peril. Energy minister Lafazanis insisted that he still supports Tsipras\u2019s government, as he left the Athens parliament tonight. We don\u2019t want snap elections, he added. In case you missed it, here\u2019s Alexis Tsipras addressing the Greek Parliament before tonight\u2019s vote. A government official is briefing that Alexis Tsipras will not resign, local media report. That suggests he believes he can shake up his government, and continue to govern - with support from opposition MPs where needed. Greece\u2019s parliament has taken a crucial step towards a third bailout, by approving the economic measures required by its lenders. With 229 MPs voting yes, and just 64 voting no, Athens has now given the green light to the plan -- even though the prime minister himself admitted many of the \u201charsh\u201d measures would hurt the Greek economy. This means that other European parliaments can now vote on the plan too. And it should encourage the eurozone to finalise a $7bn bridge loan later on Wednesday. Tsipras has also suffered a serious rebellion among his own ranks. Almost 40 MPs weren\u2019t prepared to support measures which ran counter to their election pledges in January. Prominent No voters included energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (cue uproar) and Parliamentary speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou. It\u2019s not immediately clear how Tsipras will handle this rebellion. It could have been worse, but it\u2019s certainly a challenge to his authority given his government only holds 162 out of 300 seats. Before the vote, Tsipras had urged MPs to fight Europe\u2019s attempt to mastermind a coup in Greece, and force it out of the eurozone. And at the start of the debate, anti-austerity protests were disrupted after a small group of anarchist protesters threw petrol bombs. This prompted the riot police to fire tear gas, sending people scattering Scrap that , it\u2019s actually 229 Ves Votes - the parliament did a recount..... (so I\u2019ve tweaked that last post) The Greek parliament has voted by a large majority to accept the tough package of tax rises, pension reforms, spending cuts and sweeping economic liberalisation which the eurozone demands before agreeing a third bailout. Despite the Syriza rebellion, 229 MPs voted \u2018yes\u2019 (or Nai), 64 voted \u2018no\u2019 (or Oxi), and 6 abstained. The voting is over, and it looks as if Alexis Tsipras has suffered a sizeable rebellion, with 32 or 33 (not immediately clear) voting no and 6 abstaining. This is a larger rebellion than last Friday, when MPs voted on whether to send Tsipras to Brussels to negotiate a third aid package. That\u2019s because the PM came home with a much more painful programme than hoped, which effectively makes Greece a ward of the eurozone. Another prominent Syriza MP, and energy minister, has voted to reject the deal - Panagiotis Lafazanis, the head of the Left Platform. The voting total is now: Yes: 168 No: 49 Present: 5 Around half the No votes are Syriza defectors; there are also Golden Dawn MPs. That\u2019s it! 151 MPs have voted Yes, agreeing to pass the \u2018prior actions\u2019 demanded by creditors before a third bailout can be agreed. We\u2019re now YES: 138 , NO: 42 It\u2019s all about the defections...... That\u2019s 100 votes for Yes, while the No side are lagging with 32. There have been a couple of abstentions too. Is Syriza splintering before our eyes? It looks like the Left Platform - the radical left-wing of the movement, are rejecting Tsipras\u2019s deal en masse. The junior coalition party, though, are following the line: The Yes side is leading, by 60 votes to 21 for No. But many of those Nos are Tsipras\u2019s own MPs..... Varoufakis\u2019s decision to vote NO caused quite a rumpus. Two big names have voted to reject the deal - including former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. Not a huge shock, given Varoufakis compared it to the Treaty of Versailles in a blog post today. But still, he\u2019s defied Alexis Tsipras in a crucial vote. As has house speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou - who earlier slammed the deal as a coup, that could cause social genocide. OK, finally, the parliament is starting to vote on the measures agreed with Greece\u2019s creditors, to open formal negotiations on a third bailout. So here\u2019s how it works. MPs will vote yes, or no, verbally. There are 300 MPs in the parliament (although some could be absent). The government has 162 MPs -- 149 Syriza, and 13 Independent Greeks. Tsipras should get a majority, given that three opposition parties - New Democracy, To Potami and Pasok, will back his measures. But how many of his own MPs will he lose? Tsipras responds -- the new bailout deal has a firmer commitment on discussing debt relief; just as soon as the first review is completed. And we also have pledges to consider grace periods and longer debt maturities. This is a really positive thing for the country. Despite the lateness of the hour, and the urgency of the moment, the debate continues -- New Democracy\u2019s Vangelis Meimarakis wants to know exactly what new commitments Tsipras has won on debt relief. There are some weary faces in the Athens parliament tonight.... this is their second late-night debate in five days, either side of the marathon summit meeting in Brussels. Tsipras repeats that he doesn\u2019t believe these measures on the table tonight will benefit the economy (that\u2019s hardly a contrarian view...) Alexis Tsipras is back on his feet to address a few points. He reminds MPs that he has managed to agree a deal that covers Greece\u2019s funding needs for the next three years, and which includes a commitment to debt relief. That\u2019s a positive development - we need debt restructuring to exit the crisis. The danger of Grexit hasn\u2019t completely lifted, warns New Democracy\u2019s leader. A bad agreement is better than no agreement - but it\u2019s your bad agreement, it has the signature of Alexis Tsipras on it, so you need to make it work. And in conclusion, Meimarakis reminds Tsipras that he\u2019d be in a worse position without New Democracy standing by him in this vote. New Democracy will vote in favour of the government\u2019s progamme, Meimarakis says. But that\u2019s not weakness, that\u2019s a sign of strength. It\u2019s now after 1am in Athens - this vote was meant to be wrapped up by midnight. But now Vangelis Meimarakis, interim leader of opposition New Democracy, is speaking. He tells Tsipras he wasted his opportunity to reach a deal, by messing up the negotiations. The banks are closed....because people voted for you, because of your false promises, Meimarakis adds. Tsipras concludes his speech by vowing not to run away from his responsibilities. IE - he\u2019s not about to resign. We will do whatever is possible to fight corruption, Alexis Tsipras pledges. And the Greek PM also admits that he doesn\u2019t believe in many of the measures on the table - but had to choose between accepting the deal, or a disorderly defauly. Despite this defiance, Tsipras can\u2019t get away from the fact that he came back from Brussels with a deal loaded with austerity and tough reforms. I won\u2019t try to make this deal appear better than it is, he says. It is a difficult plan, with \u201chard measures\u201d. Tsipras is arguing that the old politics is over -- the people appreciate the difference between those who fight against unfairness, and those who surrender. Tsipras admits that \u201clittle Greece\u201d may have lost the war but, he says, it has left behind something v precious: it has sown the seed of democracy and resistance to a system that no one had dared tackle before. \u201cThere was right on our side, there was economic might on theirs.\u201d (via Helena Smith) He goes on to say that in no way is the left going to be a \u201cparenthesis\u201d in Greek political life. Tsipras says his government were supported by left-wing parties, social democrats, Greens, across Europe. But it was centre-right, conservative parties who dealt such a blow to Greece (Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU, perhaps?) We faced an unfair fight, against financial powers. And we have left a heritage of dignity and democracy to Europe. This fight will bear fruit. More applause. Mystery solved! Alexis Tsipras has just arrived in the chamber, and is addressing MPs now. Colleagues, we are at a critical moment.... we are called on to take a decision with responsibility. I take full responsibility for everything, says Tsipras - and I feel proud of the fight we have fought over the last few years. \n<a> Parliament must resist this blackmail, continues Konstantopoulou -- which I guess means she\u2019s going to vote No. The people gave a clear \u201cNo\u201d in this month\u2019s referendum, says Konstantopoulou - we don\u2019t have the right to interpret it as a \u201cYes\u201d, or a \u201cNo with conditions\u201d. Getting into her stride, Konstantopoulou says the bailout deal is a coup, a crime against humanity which could lead to social genocide. Parliamentary speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou is now speaking -- criticising the way MPs were forced to vote through the measures so quickly (Not voted yet, though...) Konstantopoulou says creditors have forced destructive policies on Greece, and slams Greece\u2019s debt as odious. And a rumour is spreading that Alexis Tsipras may speak tonight -- meaning the vote will be even later. Currently Evi Christofilopou, MP for the opposition Pasok, is blasting the government for its handling of the crisis. Those who wish to see the drachma will not have their way. No to drachma, yes to euro. Here\u2019s a live-feed without a translation, for Greek speakers among you. Time for the vote? No, time for former deputy PM Evangelos Venizelos to speak -- and questioning whether correct processes are being followed. But first, MPs are hearing from Panos Kammenos, leader of the junior coalition party, Independent Greeks. He also argues that the eurozone attempted a coup, and MPs shouldn\u2019t stand for it. Eurozone finance ministers are due to sign off on the short-term loan to cover Greece\u2019s immediate needs in around 12 hours, assuming MPs approve the plan. Bong! It\u2019s midnight in Athens, and the vote hasn\u2019t taken place yet. One man is missing in tonight\u2019s parliamentary debate -- Alexis Tsipras himself, says our correspondent Helena Smith. The Greek prime minister has caused some commotion with his refusal to address the House tonight. Word has it that at this stage he believes silence is the wiser course. To say anything would be to rachet up tensions when the atmosphere is already electric, not least among MPs in his own Syriza party. But the great Athens rumour mill is also abuzz with speculation that Tsipras may see this vote as a vote of confidence - one that could trigger momentous developments if he suffers bigger losses than expected tonight. The leftist leader is reported to have put in a call to the country\u2019s head of state, president Prokopis Pavlopoulos this evening which has given added weight to speculation that he may regard the ballot as a confidence vote. Greek media are reporting that all scenarios should now be considered, including his possible resignation if a sizeable number of Syriza MPs refuse to back the measures. As midnight approaches in Athens, Syriza parliamentary spokesman Nikos Filis takes the stand. He\u2019s arguing that Greece faced a coup in Brussels last weekend, in those bailout talks. MPs must decide if they are taking part in it too. Another To Potami MP, Harry Theoharis, suggests rebel government MPs and ministers should resign. Now it\u2019s economy minister Giorgos Stathakis\u2019s turn. He admits that the agreement reached with lenders is difficult, but it will stabilise the Greek banking sector. New Democracy are promising to support the government to get the bailout measures into law, but after that Tsipras is on his own (assuming he lasts that long as leader) Another New Democracy MP, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, says Greece\u2019s bailout bill has jumped by \u20ac25bn because of the damage caused to its banks. He also acknowledges the role France played in the negotiations, by insisting that Greece should remain in the eurozone. Correction: I thought some of the explosions we heard from Athens earlier were stun grenades, but watching that video back, they all appear to be petrol bombs. Sorry for the error. Here\u2019s another video clip of Greek anti-establishment protesters clashing with riot police outside the parliament in Athens, Theodorakis also says that To Potami will NOT join a coalition government. We will remain as the \u201cuseful\u201d opposition, he insists. So Tsipras can give up any hopes of shoring up his government by bringing To Potami\u2019s 17 MPs into the fold. Back in the Athens parliament, the leader of the centrist To Potami party is speaking. Stavros Theodorakis says his party will vote in favour of the bailout measures tonight. He criticises Syriza MPs for trying to take Greece back to the drachma, and says Alexis Tsipras should expel them. Theodorakis also urges Greece\u2019s young people not to give up hope and leave: A column of anti-austerity protesters are currently marching in a loop through central Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second city, and its seafront. The mood is calm, and not everyone is in the streets \u2013 the marchers just passed a pirate-themed ship full of revellers. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s about a thousand here \u2013 with VAT,\u201d jokes one protester, in a reference to the huge VAT hikes that the new bail-out will precipitate, inflating the cost of daily living. There is a sense of anger, but also of disorientation \u2013 and uncertainty about what to do, and who to blame. \u201cI feel very confused about the situation,\u201d says Giorgos, a middle-aged pharmacist who lost his job two weeks ago. \u201cI feel very angry about the memorandum, but also I have no problem for the moment with Tsipras. He was under a lot of pressure, and this is a coup.\u201d Giorgos is resentful of the EU, whose leaders have shown no compassion to a family like his \u2013 a family whose two breadwinners have lost their jobs. But equally he doesn\u2019t want to leave the euro, not yet anyway.The feeling shared by other marchers. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that,\u201d says Varvara Kyrillidou, an Italian teacher and Syriza member protesting against her party leader\u2019s decision. \u201cTo leave Europe behind, we need a plan \u2013 without a plan it\u2019s very risky for our people. And at the moment we haven\u2019t got one.\u201d Greece ideally needs to sit down and have a rethink, says Kyrillidou \u2013 but she knows there isn\u2019t time. \u201cWe\u2019re between two walls that are closing in on us.\u201d A senior member of the right-wing New Democracy party (the largest opposition group) is now speaking; Fofi Gennimata, leader of the left-wing Pasok party, is speaking in parliament. She criticises Alexis Tsipras for not being in the chamber, and for failing to build on the efforts of the last few years. The situation does appear calmer. Here\u2019s a video clip of the moments when tonight\u2019s protests in Athens turned violent, just over an hour ago (scroll back here for rolling coverage of the demo) It was filmed by Emma Graham-Harrison. Some Syriza MPs are saying they will support the package, but they clearly don\u2019t welcome its measures: Communist Party leader Dimitris Koutsoumbas is now speaking in parliament. He says \u2018History is not repeating itself as tragedy but as a farce\u2019, as he criticises the government for signing up to such a harsh austerity package. Reminder, a vote is expected before midnight Athens time (10pm BST, 5pm if you\u2019re on the East Coast of the US) Back inside the parliament building, finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has been defending the bailout terms which Greece signed up to: He says that Monday was the hardest day of his life, and one that will weigh on him for the rest of his life. Tsakalotos still looks worn down from last weekend\u2019s all-night talks in Brussels: We should repeat that the demonstrations in Athens were peaceful, until a small group began throwing petrol bombs. The clashes do appear to have calmed down now. Here\u2019s Reuters latest report from Athens: Greek protesters clash with police at anti-austerity march Greek anti-establishment protesters threw dozens of petrol bombs at police in front of parliament on Wednesday ahead of a key vote on a bailout deal, in some of the most serious violence in over two years. Police responded with tear gas, sending hundreds of people fleeing in central Syntagma Square. Earlier, thousands took to the streets of Athens in a series of otherwise peaceful marches during the day to protest against the new bailout deal that saved Greece from bankruptcy but will impose more reforms on a country already deep in crisis. Once a common sight in protest marches in Greece, clashes with police had been very rare since the leftist Syriza party came to power in January. Just before the clashes, protesters marched waving banners reading \u201cCancel the bailout!\u201d and \u201cNo to the policies of the EU, the ECB and the IMF.\u201d The media van set alight in tonight\u2019s protests is now being dealt with: More photos from tonight\u2019s clashes are coming in: This is the first serious trouble at a Greek protest this year, I believe. On the streets, there is still lots of shouting and the odd explosion, and helicopters overhead. Reuters is reporting that the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has spoken by phone with the country\u2019s president tonight: Pitched running battles broke out after the Molotov cocktails were thrown, reports Helena Smith: At the top end of square opposite Grande Bretagne it is impossible to cross. There is a lot of tea gas in the air, and Molotov cocktails lobbed by protesters now burning in the streets. I\u2019m told the protesters were from anarchist groups, and the far-left anti-capitalist Antarsya. The tourist area in Athens is full of a lot of very bemused looking visitors, kids asking \u201cwhy does my throat sting\u201d and frustrated shopkeepers saying \u201cnow I can\u2019t do any business tonight. Apologies, that CNBC Periscope feed has just stopped. More photos from the Athens clashes: Syntagma Square, the site of the Athens parliament, was just ringing to the occasional sound of explosions [updated] The demonstrators (who were peacefully demonstrating a few minutes ago) have scattered, after riot police and a small group of anarchists clashed a few minutes ago. Scores of riot police are sited at key points across the square: Michelle Caruso-Cabrera , CNBC\u2019s chief international correspondent, is broadcasting live on Periscope here: Molotov cocktails in front of Greek parliament [Watching the video again, those explosions appear to all be petrol bombs] The clashes began just as MPs began to debate the bailout plan. The demonstration in Syntagma Square in the centre of Athens has suddenly turned violent. Motolov cocktails have been let off, and the police are now tear-gassing the crowd, Emma reports. Attending tonight\u2019s demonstration is Mikalis Simeakis, who used to work as a producer for TV and radio commercials but has been unemployed for nearly four years; he lost two jobs in succession at the start of the crisis. He tells Emma: \u201cWe feel there has been a coup in our country. Tsipras let down everyone. I didn\u2019t vote him but I supported him in the referendum two weeks ago.\u201d \u201cYou might not see that many people here, because the government has made people think that no matter what they do nothing will change, but it doesn\u2019t mean they want this\u201d \u201cIf English people want to leave the EU, we want to leave ten times more.\u201d Inside parliament, the debate is starting now. There\u2019s a livefeed here with an English translation. Helena Smith is also in the centre of Athens, and reports that there is a \u201cvery healthy turnout\u201d at the demo organised by Greece\u2019s Pame communist-affiliated union. They are chanting: \u201cNo to the new memorandum. The wealth belongs to workers\u201d There are also a lot of bemused tourists looking on! Emma reports from Athens: The protest tonight seems relatively small, perhaps a few thousand, but police and some protesters appear to have come prepared for clashes. There is a fairly small group of anarchists in black, many with their faces covered or carrying motorbike helmets, at the heart of the protest, and a much heavier riot police presence around the square than for previous protests I\u2019ve been to. Photographers have all come prepared with helmets and gas masks. Overall, there\u2019s a carnival atmosphere with music, lots of food stands, many old people as well as the young. The anarchists are a very small minority, she adds. Here is Melina Kotaki, 71, in front of the Greek parliament with a sign saying \u201cMerkel and Sch\u00e4uble never again will you fly the Nazi flag on the Acropolis\u201d. Kotaki explains: \u201cIt\u2019s an allegorical reference to what happened in the war. We have a government that doesn\u2019t understand Germany wants to destroy Europe again\u201d My colleague Emma Graham-Harrison is reporting from tonight\u2019s protests: Evi Linardi, an unemployed French teacher who thinks Greece should leave the EU, told her: \u201cOur life has changed 100 percent. We see poor people sleeping on our doorsteps, hungry and we don\u2019t even have money to help them. I haven\u2019t had the heating for four years in winter because I can\u2019t pay the bills. People who never saw any of Greece\u2019s original loans are now being forced to repay them, she adds. More opposition to the bailout deal in Athens tonight, via Omaira: Journalist Omaira Gill reports that some of tonight\u2019s protesters are ready, in case the riot police fire tear gas (a familiar sight in 2011 and 2012, but not this year) Update: a translation: The protest rally, organised by unions who also called a 24-hour strike today, is getting underway now.... Nearly six months ago, the centre of Athens was filled with triumphant Syriza supports after Alexis Tsipras was swept to victory, on a promise to end austerity and negotiate a better deal with creditors. 10 days ago, the centre of Athens was filled with triumphant No supporters after Greece gave a loud OXI to its lenders\u2019 demands. Tonight, the centre of Athens is home to protesters, and riot police, in a depressing reminder of dark days earlier in the debt crisis There\u2019s no sign of trouble yet, but there\u2019s still a hefty police presence. Meanwhile Greece\u2019s main opposition party, New Democracy, has confirmed in its own parliamentary group meeting this afternoon that it will be supporting the multi-bill in tonight\u2019s make or break vote. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports In what MPs described as their party\u2019s own therapy session today, a New Democracy parliamentary group meeting has concluded with lawmakers saying they will unanimously back the proposed reforms. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be unanimous. It\u2019s a bad deal but for Greece\u2019s sake, its future in Europe, it has to go through,\u201d said shadow finance minister Anna Asimakopoulou. \u201cThe reforms will definitely be passed but I don\u2019t think, even in the best case scenario, we\u2019ll be seeing a deal for several months yet. The European Commission is always off for around three weeks in August. There is going to be uncertainty for some time yet.\u201d The big hope is that at least a degree of normalcy will return with the re-opening of banks. But Asimakopoulou, echoing the view of most economists, said she did not foresee that happening until a deal was eventually struck. \u201cThey may open for businesses to make transactions but capital controls are not going to be lifted fully for fear of a run on the banks,\u201d she told me. Economists have expressed concerns of the Greek banking system collapsing overnight if re-opened in an atmosphere where uncertainty continues to prevail. \u201cTonight\u2019s vote is crucial for the re-opening of banks,\u201d said Athens University economics professor Panaghiotis Petrakis. \u201cIf it goes smoothly I believe banks could open quite soon for certain operations such as services to help enterprises, but not for unlimited withdrawals. There is no money for that.\u201d The latest word from Athens is that the vote will take place before midnight (or 10pm BST), despite attempts to delay until the morning. Here\u2019s a video clip of Greek deputy finance minister, Nadia Valavani, confirming her resignation - and saying she couldn\u2019t support the bailout programme: Reuters has confirmed that Alexis Tsipras warned his MPs that he\u2019d struggle to stay in power without their support (hard to argue with, really!). According to a government official, Tsipras said: \u201cI am prime minister because I have a parliamentary group that supports me. If I do not have its support, it will be difficult to be prime minister the day after.\u201d Members of Syriza\u2019s youth wing are taking part in the protest outside the Greek parliament tonight: Riot police are on the streets of Athens tonight, as a group of anti-austerity protesters call on MPs to reject the bailout terms. The French national assembly has voted overwhelmingly in favour of starting negotiations for a third Greek bailout programme: Alexis Tsipras has admitted it will be difficult for him to carry on as prime minister if his own MPs fail to back him: Greek banks can only re-open once they\u2019ve received fresh capital and central bank funding is guaranteed, according to the ECB\u2019s Andreas Dombret. Bloomberg reports: \u201cFirstly, it must be guaranteed that Greek banks will be sufficiently recapitalized within the framework of a new aid program,\u201d Dombret said according to the text of a speech in Munich Wednesday released by Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, where he\u2019s also a member of the board. \u201cSecondly, it must be ensured that there is enough available liquidity, should depositors want to withdraw more money after the opening of the recapitalized banks.\u201d Given that negotiations currently taking place in Brussels over the shape of interim financing for Greece have to be concluded before talks on a third bailout package can begin, Dombret\u2019s comments signal that the ECB doesn\u2019t think Greek lenders can re-open imminently. Full story here. The European Commissions assessment of Greece\u2019s bailout signalled the possibility of debt relief and also took a less dramatic view than the IMF of the country\u2019s debt profile. According to Reuters, the commission said Greece\u2019s debt to GDP ratio would be 150% in 2022 if Athens implemented reforms, compared to the 170% forecast by the IMF. The commission said an extension of maturities of existing and new loans could be possible - depending on reforms - but it ruled out any write-offs. Meanwhile more EU states appear to be seeking collateral for any \u20ac7bn loan from the EFSM stability fund: Germany\u2019s Green party apparently passed through Athens earlier to \u201cshow solidarity\u201d with Greece, says Emma Graham-Harrison. It is rare for German politicians to be welcome in Syntagma at the moment. Of course it is not just the Greek and German parliaments which must approve the deal: Investors were reluctant to take any chances as the Greek parliament prepared to vote on the bailout deal reached after the weekend\u2019s laborious summits. Better than expected Chinese economic growth and talk by US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen that US rates could well rise this year had little impact on sentiment. So much so the UK\u2019s leading index ended the day exactly where it started, a pretty unusual occurrence. although other European markets at least managed to edge a little higher. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 was unchanged at 6753.75 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.29% at 11,550.36 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.35% at 5050.25 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB jumped 1.28% to 23,392.75 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.72% at 11,339.9 Over on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 10 points or 0.06% higher. Although maybe not: And there may be an earlier than usual finish for the vote, given there is a deadline from Greece\u2019s lenders to adhere to: A deal on the bridging loan could be on the way, AFP has heard. Yanis Varoufakis, the former finance minister, is never one to remain in the background. Now he has annotated the Euro summit document with his own thoughts. Here\u2019s a flavour of what he thinks of the Terms of Greece\u2019s Surrender, as he calls the agreement (his annotations in italics): Given the need to rebuild trust with Greece, the Euro Summit welcomes the commitments of the Greek authorities to legislate without delay a first set of measures [i.e. Greece must subject itself to fiscal waterboarding, even before any financing is offered]. These measures, taken in full prior agreement with the Institutions, will include: the streamlining of the VAT system [i.e. making it more regressive, through rate rises that encourage more VAT evasion] and the broadening of the tax base to increase revenue [i.e. dealing a major blow at the only Greek growth industry \u2013 tourism]. full implementation of the relevant provisions of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, in particular by making the Fiscal Council operational before finalizing the MoU and introducing quasi-automatic spending cuts in case of deviations from ambitious primary surplus targets after seeking advice from the Fiscal Council and subject to prior approval of the Institutions [i.e. the Greek government, which knows that the imposed fiscal targets will never be achieved under the imposed austerity, must commit to further, automated austerity as a result of the troika\u2019s newest failures.] Labour market policies should be aligned with international and European best practices, and should not involve a return to past policy settings which are not compatible with the goals of promoting sustainable and inclusive growth [i.e. there should be no mechanisms that waged labour can use to extract better conditions from employers.] to develop a significantly scaled up privatisation programme with improved governance; valuable Greek assets will be transferred to an independent fund that will monetize the assets through privatisations and other means [i.e. an East German-like Treuhand is envisaged to sell off all public property but without the equivalent large investments that W. Germany put into E. Germany in compensation for the Treuhand disaster.] in line with the Greek government ambitions, to modernise and significantly strengthen the Greek administration, and to put in place a programme, under the auspices of the European Commission, for capacity-building and de-politicizing the Greek administration [i.e. Turning Greece into a democracy-free zone modelled on Brussels, a form of supposedly technocratic government, which is politically toxic and macro-economically inept] to fully normalize working methods with the Institutions, including the necessary work on the ground in Athens, to improve programme implementation and monitoring [i.e. The Troika strikes back and demands that the Greek government invite it to return to Athens as Conqueror \u2013 the Carthaginian Peace in all its glory.] The Euro Summit stresses that nominal haircuts on the debt cannot be undertaken [N.b. The Syriza government has been suggesting, since January, a moderate debt restructure, with no haircuts, maximizing the expected net present value of Greece\u2019s repayments to creditors\u2019 \u2013 which was rejected by the Troika because their aim was, simply, to humiliate Syriza.] Greek authorities reiterate their unequivocal commitment to honour their financial obligations to all their creditors fully and in a timely manner [N.b. Which can only happen after a substantial debt restrucuture.] The full piece is here: The Euro-Summit \u2018Agreement\u2019 on Greece \u2013 annotated by Yanis Varoufakis A reminder that the Eurogroup will tomorrow discuss whether Greece has met its commitments after the vote: And of course, the European Central Bank meets tomorrow, with a press conference at lunchtime. Here\u2019s something to listen to while we wait for the Greek parliamentary vote - our politics weekly podcast discusses the bailout agreement reached earlier this week. More from energy minister Panayiotis Lafazanis who will vote against the bailout plans: Which seems a little...confusing. Here\u2019s the embrace between house speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou and Alexis Tsipras which our correspondent Helena Smith referred to earlier. The European Central Bank meets today and tomorrow, and the question of emergency liquidity assistance to Greece\u2019s beleaguered banks is likely to be high on the agenda. But no decision on the ELA will be made until tomorrow, reports Bloomberg, once the outcome of the Greek parliamentary vote is known. Bloomberg says: The European Central Bank is awaiting a midnight signal from the Greek parliament before it can grant fresh liquidity to keep the country\u2019s lenders alive. At its regular two-day meeting in Frankfurt starting Wednesday, the Governing Council will discuss a Greek banking system that is in limbo after more than two weeks of closure and capital controls, and which the European Commission says is close to collapse. A decision on the level of Emergency Liquidity Assistance for lenders is planned for Thursday, a person familiar with the matter said. While the ECB could help by increasing the cap on ELA, it needs assurances that Greece will proceed with a planned bailout program, including repaying debt to the central bank on July 20. The Governing Council meets hours before Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras puts reform measures to his legislature that have sparked a rebellion in his party. Full report here: ECB Awaits Athens Signal as Greek Banks Held in Limbo As well as Athens and Germany, there are protests planned in Barcelona too: Alexis Tsipras has, it appears, thrown the gauntlet to his own parliamentary group, reports our correspondent Helena Smith. Addressing MPs ahead of tonight\u2019s crucial vote, the prime minister said: \u201cWhoever has an alternative [solution] should come and tell me.\u201d Tsipras was greeted with rousing applause by the Syriza party MPs in what could be a sign that his appeal for support is working. Tellingly, house speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou, one of the party\u2019s loudest critics of austerity, rushed to embrace him as the meeting began. The parliamentary session is expected to last several hours as MPs discuss the pros and cons of a deal that, if hard, will at least allow Greece to stand on its feet with secured mid-term financing and the promise of debt relief, government officials say. The 76-strong parliamentary group of New Democracy, the country\u2019s main opposition party, will also gather shortly. Although the party has said it will vote in favour of the deal there have been voices of dissent from MPs wondering whether the government is at all capable of enforcing the proposed reforms. More intrigue: And here is the resignation letter from finance ministry secretary general Manos Manousakis: Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy has said he will present the details of latest Greek bailout to Spanish parliament in order to seek approval for the country\u2019s multi-billion euro contribution, writes Ashifa Kassam. \u201cAlthough this step is not obligatory in our country, it is my intention to bring the deal before parliament for debate and possible approval... because it is a big sum that Spanish taxpayers are being asked to guarantee,\u201d Rajoy told the lower house of parliament on Wednesday. No date was given as to when the debate or vote would take place, but as Rajoy\u2019s conservative People\u2019s party holds a majority in the house, the move is largely symbolic. Rajoy has said that Spain would end up contributing about 12% of Greece\u2019s latest bailout package. His stance was a reversal from two years ago, when Rajoy refused to allow the Spanish bank bailout to be debated in congress, despite requests from the opposition. His readiness this time around could be rooted in the wide gap in how the agreement is being perceived by Spanish politicians. While Rajoy has praised the latest agreement with Greece and argued that it will create economic growth and employment, opposition parties in Spain have called it a financial coup against Athens and Syriza. On Wednesday, in a nod to this difference of opinion, Alberto Garz\u00f3n of the United Left party gifted Rajoy a copy of John Maynard Keynes\u2019 book \u201cThe Economic Consequences of the Peace\u201d during the parliamentary session. Published in 1919, Keynes argues that reparations imposed on Germany in the Treaty of Versailles would lead to Germany\u2019s financial collapse and send political and economic aftershocks across Europe. \u201cTo Mariano Rajoy,\u201d Garz\u00f3n wrote on the first page of the book. \u201cWith the hope that reason will assert itself in the face of market fundamentalism and give way to a world based on social justice as soon as possible.\u201d A positive sign for the chances of the deal passing in the Greek parliament later: Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has said if the US economy continues to recover as expected, interest rates are likely to rise some time this year. But in a long speech to Congress, she (briefly) mentions Greece as one of the possible problems which could affect the US economy: Foreign developments, in particular, pose some risks to U.S. growth. Most notably, although the recovery in the euro area appears to have gained a firmer footing, the situation in Greece remains difficult. And China continues to grapple with the challenges posed by high debt, weak property markets, and volatile financial conditions. Full speech here. Germany believes extending maturities for Greek debt to 30 years or so is an option as long as it does not \u201csignificantly\u201d reduce the value of the debt, Reuters is reporting. German finance ministry spokesman Martin Jaeger said: That is certainly an element that one can consider, but it will not be the solution if it leads to a significant reduction in the cash value (of the debt) as then we would in the end have nothing other than a debt haircut via the back door. He confirmed that the IMF assessment of Greece - which suggested a 30-year grace period before it has to start paying off its debts - was known by EU leaders at the weekend\u2019s summits. Another resignation: And confirmation of a Syriza no vote: Earlier EC vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis gave a breakdown of the \u20ac35bn in EU funds available to Greece under the proposed deal to help job creation and economic growth: \u20ac20 billion will come from the European Structural and Investment Funds A further \u20ac15 billion from the Common Agricultural Policy An additional \u20ac280 million is available for the most vulnerable And there is the Youth Guarantee and other forms of EU financing that are also available And he said that given there were currently no prospects for any bilateral help, the EFSM programme was the best method of providing Greece with short term funding: ...The Commission, responding to the request from the Greek authorities, has proposed to the Council to grant short-term emergency assistance, up to 3 months, from the EFSM and to build the bridge needed until the ESM programme is in place. The EFSM loans would then be repaid with the money from the ESM disbursements. This is not an easy option. We are aware of serious concerns of non-Euro area Member States. We are therefore working on arrangements to protect non-Euro area Member States from any negative financial consequences, should the EFSM loans not be re-paid. His full statement is here: New Start for Jobs and Growth in Greece Reportedly only around 15 of the Syriza central committee nay-sayers (who now amount to 109 according to the rednotebook link in the tweet below) are MPs. Even so, they are clearly not happy. A reminder, that 201 Syriza commitee members is not the same as the number of MPs. Here is our analysis from yesterday on the Greek parliament: More signs of possible trouble for Alexis Tsipras successfully getting the debt deal agreed by the Greek parliament: And the first part of the parliamentary process is over: Former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has been speaking in the Greek parliament and he is not happy. The UK prime minister has said the IMF is right to call for debt relief for Greece. At prime minister\u2019s question time, David Cameron said: The principle that there must be debt relief is right. It is in the UK\u2019s interest for the eurozone to resolve how it conducts itself. They need to resolve these issues, and quite fast. Opposition leader Harriet Harman says, with President Putin waiting in the wings, this has wider significance. This is not just about economics. Cameron says Harman is right. It is not for Britain to bail out eurozone countries. But if it left the euro and needed humanitarian assistance, he thinks the Commons would take a different view. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is live-blogging PMQs: It\u2019s official. Nadia Valavani, deputy finance minister, has resigned from Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government just hours before the parliament votes on the bailout package. As flagged earlier, Valavani has told Tsipras that it is \u201cimpossible\u201d for her to keep serving in his government, given the austerity measures he had agreed to. In a letter released by the finance ministry, Valavani warned that Greece faced a \u201ccrushing\u201d capitulation at the hands of its creditors in Brussels. The bailout terms were not a \u201cviable solution\u201d to Greece\u2019s problems, she insisted, warning: The solution imposed today in such a depressing way is not sustainable for the Greek people and for the country. And this appears to be Valavani\u2019s letter: Opposition to the bailout in Germany is growing, according to the Bild newspaper, especially among Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU and CSU MPs. In a report headlined \u201cNow let US say Oxi\u201d* it quotes a member of the CDU/CSU saying they expected some 50 votes against. It also speaks to a number of MPs who are against the deal. At the time of the German vote in February on whether to extend the second Greek bailout, 542 MPs voted in favour, 32 against and 13 abstained. The Bild report is here (in German): Jetzt sagen WIR mal OXI! *At the risk of stating the obvious, Oxi is of course Greek for No. Even if a bridging loan is agreed, it won\u2019t cover all Greece\u2019s funding needs. Back in Brussels, the Commission has confirmed that it is pushing for Greece\u2019s bridging loan to come from the EFSM: Back in Athens, deputy finance minister Nadia Valavani has resigned. According to reports, Valavani told Tsipras early on Monday that she couldn\u2019t accept the terms of the bailout. George Osborne has demanded that eurozone countries indemnify the Treasury against any losses if Britain is forced to contribute to the \u20ac7bn bridging loan for crisis-hit Greece. As explained earlier, the Commission plans to tap the EU-wide bailout mechanism, the European Financial Stability Mechanism, to meet part of the cost of the bridging loan, putting the UK on the hook for just over 15% of the cost. That breaks the promise made to David Cameron in 2011 that British taxpayers would not be forced to underwrite eurozone bailouts. So the Treasury\u2019s solution is to push for the \u20ac1.9bn of profits the European Central Bank has made on Greek bonds to be set aside in an account that could be used to compensate non-euro member countries for any losses. Greek\u2019s embattled Syriza government had previously hoped to tap into that pot of money itself, but it could now allow Britain to drop its objections, and argue that its pledge hadn\u2019t been broken. As a Treasury insider put it: \u201cthis would be strengthening that promise, by giving it legal form\u201d. Our data editor Alberto Nardelli has drawn out the key points from the IMF\u2019s latest Greek debt sustainability analysis: Protesters are marching in Athens against the new austerity measures which parliament will vote on tonight. The main public sector union ADEDY has also called a 24-hour strike today, to urge MPs not to back this third bailout: The European Commission is on a collision course with non-eurozone EU members, after proposing giving Greece a \u20ac7bn bridge loan to cover its financial obligations this month. A document seen by Reuters shows that the money would come from the EU-wide European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), despite strong lobbying yesterday by several countries including Britain. Prime minister David Cameron won a commitment in 2011 that the EFSM wouldn\u2019t be used for eurozone bailouts. EU lawyers, though, appears to have concluded this was a political pledge - therefore breakable, given the urgency to make sure Greece doesn\u2019t default on its repayments to the ECB. Reuters reports that the EFSM would raise the money from the private sector, and be repaid in three months (once Greece\u2019s new bailout is agreed). So taxpapers wouldn\u2019t actually stump up cash - unless the bailout deal collapses, taking the bridging loan with it.... And there are rumours swirling of a face-saving climbdown. Last night, German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble cast doubt on German commitment to the Greek deal by saying he still believed in his temporary Grexit plan and claiming many in the German government shared his view. The embattled minister told journalists after a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels on Tuesday night that: \u201cThere are a lot of people, also in the German government, who are fairly convinced that in the interests of Greece and the Greek people the [Grexit plan] would be the better option.\u201d But despite insisting otherwise, Sch\u00e4uble is looking increasingly isolated. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition partners the SPD have demanded she rein him in. \u201c[Merkel] has to deal with her finance minister,\u201d the party\u2019s vice chairman Ralf Stegner told Der Spiegel. \u201cThe deal agreed at the weekend ultimately applies to the whole government.\u201d Meanwhile US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew is flying to Frankfurt for emergency talks with European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. Tomorrow he will meet Sch\u00e4uble in Berlin. In a statement the Treasury has said the purpose of the trip is \u201cto continue engagement with European counterparts on the ongoing situation in Greece.\u201d Lew was quick to welcome Monday\u2019s deal and is thought to be engaged in a last ditch attempt to save it. And anti-austerity protests are planned tonight across Germany to show solidarity with the Greeks.Thousands are expected to gather in Berlin, Bremen, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Kassel, Koblenz, Kiel, Regensburg, Stuttgart and Dortmund as the Greek parliament debates the deal ahead of tonight\u2019s crucial vote. On the Facebook group for the Berlin event, demo organisers Blockupy put out a call to those: \u201con the side of all in Europe who fear a German Europe, who don\u2019t want a German government of oppression on their doorsteps, in their neighbourhoods, in their parliaments.\u201d The Greek parliamentary speaker, Zoe Konstantopoulou, has urged MPs to stand up and show defiance against the country\u2019s lenders. She told today\u2019s debate that: \u201cVia blackmail that is directed at the prime minister, the government and the parliament, they are aiming to realise policies that the prime minister - who I respect greatly \u2026has himself [opposed]. Parliament should not complete this blackmail, it should not accept the blackmail being directed at the government.\u201d (thanks to Helena Smith in Athens for the quotes) Konstantopoulou is also furious that such a vital piece of legislation is being rattled through parliament at lightning speed, with no time for serious debate or analysis. Not that Greek MPs are invited to make changes to the plan. At the request of Tsipras, Konstantopoulou will not be presiding over tonight\u2019s vote. Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece\u2019s new-ish finance minister, has opened the debate in Athens. He didn\u2019t sugar the pill, telling MPs that many of the measures in the bailout bill will be recessionary. But the upside is that it preserves Greece\u2019s place in the eurozone, so investment can flow back into the country. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult deal, a deal for which only time will show if it is economically viable.\u201d Greece\u2019s immediate future will rest on whether Alexis Tsipras, the embattled prime minister, can manage to persuade enough MPs to swallow the bitter pill of austerity and give their backing to reforms that even he has no belief in. Failure to keep defections below 40 (and the number of mutinous MPs appears to be growing) could trigger unforeseen events. \u201cIt is absolutely essential that defections are kept below 40,\u201d said the prominent political commentator Alexis Papahelas. Above that, he said, and the country could possibly become ungovernable. Tsipras is hoping that a wide-ranging reshuffle immediately after the vote will inject his cabinet with renewed life. In that scenario (by far the best for the leftist-led government) four ministers, who have spoken openly against the terms of the latest bailout programme, would leave office. At least three others, including the labour minister Panos Skourletis, a close Tsipras ally, would be moved to other posts. If the vote produces a shock result, with losses much greater than anyone expected, a caretaker government will almost certainly have to assume office before the country goes to fresh elections in the early fall. Neither scenario, at this point, can be ruled out. But Syriza, a coalition of groups from the radical left, is a party that works to the tune of collectivity\u2013 fierce debate and disagreement is nothing new and is in fact heartily encouraged. What is more important, say Syriza cadres, is that the leftist project takes hold of Greece long-term. \u201cThe agreement is hard, very hard, but the alternative is a march into the unknown with all the possible and eventual catastrophes for society and the economy,\u201d Greece\u2019s pre-eminent sociologist, Konstantine Tsoukalas, told me. Tsoukalas, an honorary state MP with Syriza, added: \u201cThe agreement is a provisional set-back that at some point will be re-negotiated, it is a bid for time.\u201d In the name of keeping Syriza in power, MPs may ultimately given the prime minister the support he wants tonight. As party\u2019s spokeswoman Rania Svigou explains: \u201cFor us, unity is what is needed to confront every difficulty and I want to believe that it will in the immediate future.\u201d The debate is underway in the Athens Parliament -- it\u2019s being streamed live here. Despite George Osborne\u2019s best efforts, it appears that UK taxpayers could help fund a bridging loan to Greece. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel reports that the Commission has formally proposed using the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism \u2014 funded by all 28 EU members \u2014 to fund Greece\u2019s immediate funding needs. That\u2019s going to enrage the Treasury - yesterday, George Osborne declared that the idea was a \u201ccomplete non-starter\u201d. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s new debt sustainability analysis has been warmly welcomed in Paris. Finance minister Michel Sapin told BFM TV that his government already realises that Greece needs deeper debt relief. \u201cThe IMF is saying the same thing as we are ... we cannot help Greece if we maintain the same debt reimbursement burden on the Greek economy.\u201d Sapin added that the IMF was calling for debt relief but not an outright haircut, Reuters adds. That\u2019s true, up to a point. The Fund does suggest that Greece needs 30-year extensions on loan repayments. But it also identifies two other options: explicit annual transfers to the Greek budget deep upfront haircuts. The Greek finance ministry has extended the country\u2019s bank holiday again, until close of business on Thursday. In reality, they\u2019ll stay shut until the ECB provides more emergency liquidity. Protests are taking place in Thessaloniki this morning, against the bailout measures which the Athens parliament will vote on tonight. They\u2019ve hung a large poster on a government ministry. It shows a picture of Tsipras alongside his predecessors, George Papandreou and Antonis Samaras, whose austerity programmes he\u2019d vowed to overturn. It reads: \u201c1st memorandum, 2nd memorandum, 3rd memorandum, we bled enough, we paid enough. People take the matters in your own hands, blockade to the new measures and perpetual memorandums\u201d. Thessaloniki was the city where Syriza formally promised last September to end austerity if elected, in a manifesto known as the Thessaloniki programme. Today the city\u2019s Syriza activists are wondering what happened to it, and whether or not they should stand by their leader. \u201cWe must not leave Syriza now,\u201d says Giorgos Kiritsis, a former parliamentary candidate for Syriza, shortly before a major meeting of the party\u2019s local branch. \u201cWe must remain \u2013 to bring Syriza back to our side. If we lose the internal battle, then we should leave. But not before.\u201d Fighting that battle means rejecting the \u2018third memorandum\u2019, and holding new elections, he initially says. \u201cThis memorandum is incompatible with a party of the left. I think new elections should happen and we will have a new party.\u201d His colleague, Georgos Archontopoulos, a local union leader and another former Syriza candidate, interjects. Would new elections achieve a new result? \u201cMany people who vote for Syriza also voted no in the referendum,\u201d Archontopoulos says. \u201cBut they don\u2019t want Grexit and they want Syriza to continue because they trust them to manage things better than the neo-liberals.\u201d So Kiritsis has a re-think, and concludes. \u201cIt would be better not to go to election but for Tsipras to reshuffle the government. Throw out the neoliberal people who have a negative effect on the prime minister, and have a government of the pure left.\u201d Greece\u2019s deputy PM, Yannis Dragasakis, has credited Washington with helping to get an agreement with creditors which includes a commitment to consider debt relief: Speaking before tonight\u2019s vote, Dragasakis said: \u201cI have to publicly thank the U.S. government and Mr.(President Barack) Obama as without their help and persistence that the deal has to include the debt issue and development horizon we might have not succeeded,\u201d Economists don\u2019t agree on much, but there\u2019s a strong consensus that the Greek bailout plan is badly flawed: And Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services has dubbed it a \u201cpreposterous bail-out package\u201d. The IMF\u2019s incendiary new debt sustainability analysis was sent to EU authorities at the weekend. That means that the main players should have been fully briefed when they signed off on the Greek plan. So either they were wilfully obtuse, or they believe the debt relief issue can be tackled. Marina Prentoulis, Syriza\u2019s representative in the UK, has welcomed the IMF\u2019s warning yesterday that Greece needs deep debt relief, much more than Europe has admitted. Interviewed on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, she pointed out that Alexis Tsipras had been calling for debt relief for months. All the time, the other side... they don\u2019t want to discuss the debt. They still don\u2019t want to discuss the debt. We know it\u2019s urgent that someone will take care of that. I\u2019m very sorry not only for Greece but the European Union and the eurozone and somebody has to react.\u201d Is it encouraging that the IMF has broken ranks? \u201cI think so. We have to remember that for these measures that we are discussing... the IMF will be part of that. They have to agree, still. There are still negotiations going on. We see a split between the IMF and the European Union. We hope the people of Europe will realise what games they have been playing in the case of Greece and Europe as well. They have been [effectively] lying to us, all the people of Europe, all this time.\u201d Does this a sea change making debt relief likely? We hope this is going to happen.\u201d Prentoulis added that Greece isn\u2019t the only eurozone country faces deep debt problems - Syriza want reform of the eurozone so those problems can be dealt with. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek crisis. There are two things in the world you never want to let people see how you make \u2018em - laws and sausages. And even the most dubious pork emporium might baulk at serving up some of the gristle that Greek MPs will have to swallow tonight, in a bid for that third bailout. Last night, prime minister Alexis Tsipras admitted that it was a bad deal \u2013 but the best that was available to him at the Brussels summit. As we covered in last night\u2019s blog, Tsipras also pledged not to abandon his post (although if he suffers a massive rebellion, he ti might not be his choice). But the real problem isn\u2019t what went into the Greek sausages, it\u2019s what was left out. Debt relief. And that\u2019s why the International Monetary Fund\u2019s intervention yesterday changes the rules of the game. The IMF savaged the deal cooked up in Brussels, warning that the budget surpluses are unrealistic, the growth forecasts are too high. So the eurozone must either give Greece 30-years of debt relief or write off some of its debt -- which it thinks will hit 200% of GDP within two years. And the underlying message is that if that doesn\u2019t happen, the Fund probably won\u2019t be around to help any more. So, lots for Greek MPs to digest as they plough through the tax rises, pension cuts, labour market reforms, industry deregulation demanded by creditors. The process starts soon, with a vote tonight -- perhaps 10pm Athens (8pm BST). And while that\u2019s going on, eurozone officials will be struggling to find bridge funding to help Greece meet large debt repayments to the European Central Bank this summer. There was something of a row in Brussels yesterday, as non-eurozone members fought efforts to use a European Union-wide fund. The money has to come from somewhere, though. We\u2019ll be tracking all the action though the day....</a>",

Now he has annotated the Euro summit document with his own thoughts.</strong> Here\u2019s a flavour of what he thinks of the Terms of Greece\u2019s Surrender, as he calls the agreement (his annotations in italics):</p> <p>Given the need to rebuild trust with Greece, the Euro Summit welcomes the commitments of the Greek authorities to legislate without delay a first set of measures <em>[i.e. Greece must subject itself to fiscal waterboarding, even before any financing is offered].</em> These measures, taken in full prior agreement with the Institutions, will include:</p> <ul> <li>the streamlining of the VAT system <em>[i.e. making it more regressive, through rate rises that encourage more VAT evasion] </em>and the broadening of the tax base to increase revenue [<em>i.e. dealing a major blow at the only Greek growth industry \u2013 tourism].</em><br></li> </ul> <ul> <li>full implementation of the relevant provisions of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, in particular by making the Fiscal Council operational before finalizing the MoU and introducing quasi-automatic spending cuts in case of deviations from ambitious primary surplus targets after seeking advice from the Fiscal Council and subject to prior approval of the Institutions [<em>i.e. the Greek government, which knows that the imposed fiscal targets will never be achieved under the imposed austerity, must commit to further, automated austerity as a result of the troika\u2019s newest failures.</em>]<br></li> </ul> <p>Labour market policies should be aligned with international and European best practices, and should not involve a return to past policy settings which are not compatible with the goals of promoting sustainable and inclusive growth <em>[i.e. there should be no mechanisms that waged labour can use to extract better conditions from employers.]</em></p> <ul> <li>to develop a significantly scaled up privatisation programme with improved governance; valuable Greek assets will be transferred to an independent fund that will monetize the assets through privatisations and other means <em>[i.e. an East German-like Treuhand is envisaged to sell off all public property but without the equivalent large investments that W. Germany put into E. Germany in compensation for the Treuhand disaster.]</em> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>in line with the Greek government ambitions, to modernise and significantly strengthen the Greek administration, and to put in place a programme, under the auspices of the European Commission, for capacity-building and de-politicizing the Greek administration [<em>i.e. Turning Greece into a democracy-free zone modelled on Brussels, a form of supposedly technocratic government, which is politically toxic and macro-economically inept]</em><br></li> </ul> <ul> <li>to fully normalize working methods with the Institutions, including the necessary work on the ground in Athens, to improve programme implementation and monitoring <em>[i.e. The Troika strikes back and demands that the Greek government invite it to return to Athens as Conqueror \u2013 the Carthaginian Peace in all its glory.]</em><br></li> </ul> <p>The Euro Summit stresses that nominal haircuts on the debt cannot be undertaken <em>[N.b.
