      "bodyText": "US stock markets hit new peaks on Friday after forecast-beating results from the technology companies including Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft . All three saw their shares soar to record highs in the wake of better than expected quarterly updates, adding billions in revenues and increasing profits compared with the same three-month period in 2016. Overall, the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.6%, hitting a record high of 6,664 by mid-morning in New York. The S&amp;P technology index \u2013 which has gained about 30% so far this year \u2013 added 2.6% to a new peak of 1,086. Many analysts had become concerned that the value of technology shares had reached unsustainable levels and could be heading for a sharp correction, but the results from the three companies announced after the market closed on Thursday allayed fears of a new dotcom bubble. Eric Wiegand, the senior portfolio manager at US Bank Private Wealth Management, told Reuters: \u201cWhile valuations are full, it certainly becomes imperative on them to deliver solid operating results and that\u2019s something that we did see.\u201d Amazon shares jumped more than 11% in early dealings on Wall Street, with third quarter revenues up 34% to $43.7bn, helped by its recent purchase of the Whole Foods Markets chain. Microsoft\u2019s share price added nearly 8% as investors welcomed news of a 12% rise in revenues to $24.5bn, better than the expected $23.56bn. Adding to the technology bonanza was Alphabet, which saw revenues jump 24% to $27.8bn, with stronger than expected advertising sales at Google and a strong performance from YouTube. Concerns about the company\u2019s dominant market position have yet to hit its financial results, and the shares rose about 6%. Amazon\u2019s share price rise added nearly $9bn to the value of the 17% stake in the business owned by chief executive Jeff Bezos. The rise took his total wealth to about $92.5bn and allowed him to overtake Microsoft founder Bill Gates as the world\u2019s richest man. Gates\u2019 gain on Friday amounted to about $550m, taking his wealth to $88.5bn, although he has given away much of his fortune to charity. This is the second time Bezos has become the world\u2019s richest man. In July, hopes for positive second quarter figures from Amazon lifted the company\u2019s shares and briefly pushed Bezos above Gates in the rankings. But the results disappointed investors , Amazon shares fell back and Gates regained his crown. This time Amazon has outperformed expectations, with net earnings at $256m or 52 cents a share, well above the forecasts of just three cents. As well as the boost from Whole Foods\u2019 grocery sales, Amazon benefited from its Prime Day promotion in the summer. After the results, Credit Suisse raised its target price for Amazon shares from $1,350 to $1,385. But the effects of Amazon continuing to win business from older retailers reliant on physical stores was shown by a profit warning from department store JC Penney. Its shares dropped 17% after it said it was forced to sell off unwanted inventory at discount prices and warned it no longer expected an increase in full-year sales. Microsoft, as part of its revival under chief executive Satya Nadella, has focused on its cloud computing business to offset flagging sales of its Windows software. Revenues from the cloud business \u2013 which includes products such as Office 365 - rose 14%, while the personal computers division slipped 0.2%. Microchip maker Intel, up 5% after its results, and Twitter, 4% higher following slightly better than expected revenues, also added to the buoyant mood in the sector. Apple, which saw strong demand for its iPhone X on its first day of sales on Friday, added 2% ahead of results next week. Facebook, which also reports next week, rose 3%. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up only 0.1%, weighed down by disappointing results from oil company Chevron and a downbeat report from pharmaceuticals business Merck, which suffered disruption to its business after a cyber attack earlier in the year. The Dow was also undermined by the dollar strengthening in the wake of a higher than expected third quarter GDP figure, adding to belief that the US Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates at its December meeting. In Europe, most markets ended higher, thanks to weakness in the euro after Thursday\u2019s European Central Bank meeting indicated a gradual reduction in its bond buying programme. But Spain\u2019s Ibex dropped more than 1% after the Catalan government controversially declared independence following the 1 October referendum.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, European stock markets have closed higher - but Spain has bucked the trend as the Catalan crisis escalates further. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 closed 18 points higher at 7505, while the French CAC and German DAX both gained around 0.7%. Consumer-focused companies did well, as did oil firms following the jump in Brent crude to a two-year high. America\u2019s solid growth report reassured investors that the global economy is in decent shape. But, Spain\u2019s IBEX closed down 1%, as traders are spooked by this afternoon\u2019s declaration of independence by MPs in Catalonia - which is likely to lead to Madrid imposing direct rule. David Madden of CMC Markets says: The political outlook is very uncertainty, and investors are getting more nervous by the minute. Investors will be reluctant to hold Spanish stocks over the weekend, for fear we could see a repeat of the violence that took place on the referendum day. Over on Wall Street, though, the Nasdaq continues to hit new highs. Here\u2019s a reminder of why, from CMC Markets: Alphabet revealed a 24% jump in third quarter profits to $27.8 billion and earnings per share (EPS) jumped by 5.6% to $9.57, easily exceeding the $8.33 analysts were expecting. The core advertising business and the other operations are performing well, but investors are as bit concerned about the rising costs. Cost per click fell by 18% and traffic acquisition costs exceeded dealer\u2019s forecasts. Alphabet is still pouring more money and resources into its cloud division, and this is an area that has huge growth potential. The tock is up over 5% today. Amazon registered a 34% jump in revenue to $43.7 billion and that compared with the forecast of $42.14. The EPS came in at 52 cents, which smashed the estimate of 3 cents. Amazon saw sales in North America jump by 35%, the rest of the world saw sales rise by 29%. Amazon Web Services (AWS) posted a 42% jump in sales \u2013 it is the most profitable division in the company. Amazon is expanding in the cloud commuting, and it is proving to be successful. The share price has gained 11% today. And, that\u2019s probably all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW This is a great fact: By my reckoning, Amazon is now valued at around $546bn, Microsoft is worth $650bn and Alphabet has a market capitalisation of some $723bn. Amazon\u2019s share price has now surged by 11%, raising the chances that Jeff Bezos will overtake Bill Gates and become the world\u2019s richest person. Align Technology, the dental equipment firm, is keeping Amazon off the top spot, though, after posting its own record results yesterday. Here\u2019s a chart showing the rise, and fall, and rise again of the technology-focused Nasdaq over the last two decades: This rally in the oil price will cheer the Opec cartel, who have been restricting production in an attempt to push prices higher. But...it may also persuade rival producers, such as America\u2019s shale industry, to increase their own output. It is also likely to push inflation up globally, once it pushes up fuel and energy prices. Boom! Brent crude has pushed over $60 per barrel for the first time since July 2015. Anyone who bought tech stocks at the depths of the last recession, in 2009, is sitting on some massive profits: Over in Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has attempted to quash heated speculation the his government is about to cut a \u20ac2.4bn deal with the Washington to upgrade its F16 fighter planes. Helena Smith reports from Athens Addressing parliament the leftist leader insisted that no agreement had as yet been reached, saying \u201cit is still under negotiation.\u201d Far from being a \u20ac2.4bn deal the government had a \u201cceiling of \u20ac1.1bn\u201d Tsipras insisted. The Greek prime minister has come under fierce attack for the deal initially announced by U.S president Donald Trump during Oval Office talks last week. Senior members of Tsipras\u2019 own Syria part have deplored the deal, calling it outrageous that so much should be spent on a military agreement when the debt stricken country could ill afford ambulances and basic equipment in schools because of budget restraints. Trump had said the \u20ac2.4bn deal would be a job creator in the United States. Tsipras himself recently checked out Greece\u2019s air capabilities, when flew in an F16 fighter during a visit to the military airport of Larissa earlier this month... Here\u2019s some more expert reaction to the news that the US economy grew faster than expected in the last quarter: Neil Birrell, Chief Investment Officer at Premier Asset Management: \u201cThe US GDP data released today shows that the economy is stronger than expected. It grew at 3% in the third quarter against consensus expectations of 2.6%. The hurricanes made consumer spending hard to predict but overall they do not seem to have had a negative impact on growth. Inflationary pressures also look higher than expected, but the rate is still well below the Fed\u2019s target. This news is positive for the Dollar and expectations for an interest rate increase will be on the up as well. Overall, the US economy is performing well.\u201d Charlie Bilello of Pension Partners points out that the current recovery has been slower than previous expansions, although it\u2019s also lasted a long time.... Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, says the US has shrugged off the devastation of the hurricane season. \u201cIn spite of the obstacles thrown in its path by two devastating hurricanes, the US economy is flying at a fair clip. We may even see this accelerate in the last part of the year as economic activity that was hit by hurricanes Harvey and Irma recovers, and in the longer-term, we should see infrastructure investment in the areas most heavily affected. The Nasdaq index of tech stocks has jumped by 1.8% in early trading, to a new all-time high. Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company) and Intel are all among the top risers. BREAKING: Tech stocks are rallying hard on Wall Street. Amazon\u2019s shares have spiked by over 8% at the start of trading in New York, following last night\u2019s impressive financial results. That takes them back over the $1,000 mark. Investors are impressed that Amazon achieved earnings of 52 cents a share, way ahead of forecasts of 3 cents a share. Alphabet has also opened strongly, gaining almost 5%, after it also beat revenue and earnings forecasts. Traders are also driving Microsoft and Intel\u2019s shares higher Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, explains why Wall Street is so impressed: \u201cWe would characterize last night\u2019s Amazon September results as a \u2018Picasso-like quarter\u2019 with the company handily beating all metrics across the board,\u201d \u201cLast night\u2019s quarter ... is another feather in Bezos\u2019 cap.\u201d Back in Europe, Spanish government bonds are being sold off after the Catalan parliament voted to declare independence. Madrid\u2019s stock market is also suffering, with the IBEX index of leading shares plunging by 2% as the crisis in the region escalates further. My colleagues Sam Jones and Stephen Burgen report from Barcelona: The Catalan parliament has voted to establish an independent republic in defiance of the Spanish government, which is expected to fire the region\u2019s president and impose direct rule within the next few hours. On Friday afternoon, Catalan MPs voted for independence by a margin of 70 votes to 10. Two ballot papers were blank. The proposal, brought by the region\u2019s ruling Together for Yes coalition and their far-left allies the CUP party, was bitterly attacked by oppostion MPs who boycotted he vote.... Donald Trump will surely be pleased by today\u2019s GDP report, as it shows America\u2019s economy has grown at a healthy rate on his watch. But....how long will it last? Capital Economics predicts that GDP will accelerate next year, if the US president delivers on his tax and spending plans. But it could then slow sharply in 2019. Paul Ashworth, their chief US economist, explains: GDP growth for 2017 as a whole is currently tracking at around 2.1% and, assuming we see a modest fiscal stimulus in early 2018, we expect GDP growth to accelerate to 2.5% next year, even after allowing for a more aggressive pace of monetary tightening. As the stimulus wears off and the cumulative monetary tightening begins to bit, however, 2019 could be a very different story. We expect GDP growth to slow to only 1.5%. America\u2019s economy has now posted two successive quarters of 3% annualised growth, for the first time in three years. The Bureau of Economic Analysis says that America\u2019s growth in the last quarter came from \u201cpersonal consumption expenditures (PCE), private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, and federal government spending\u201d. But \u201cresidential fixed investment and state and local government spending\u201d both had a negative impact on growth. The US dollar is strengthening, as Wall Street traders calculate that this solid growth raises the chances of an interest rate rise in December: Economists are impressed by America\u2019s economic performance over the last quarter, especially given the disruption caused by the hurricane season. For example, here\u2019s Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at financial services giant Allianz: Justin Wolfers, professor at the University of Michigan, says America\u2019s long slow expansion has continued. He tweets: Jason Furman, who chaired President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, has the bigger picture: Today\u2019s GDP report shows that consumer spending across America slowed in the last quarter, to a rate of 2.4% from 3.3% in the second quarter. That is partly due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma - so the underlying picture is probably stronger. Businesses boosted their inventories, suggesting they expect strong demand in the coming months. This inventory investment added 0.73 percentage points to third-quarter GDP growth. Business investment rose during the July-September quarter, at a rate of 3.9%, led by spending on new equipment. Exports also rose, by 2.3%, while imports fell by 0.8% -- that narrowed the trade deficit, and made a positive contribution to growth. Breaking: America\u2019s economy expanded at an annualised rate of 3.0% in the third quarter of 2017. That beats Wall Street expectations, and is another quarter of solid growth. That\u2019s equivalent to a quarterly growth rate of 0.75%, faster than the 0.4% growth which the UK managed during the last quarter. More to follow! The Wall Street Journal has compiled a helpful list of things to watch for in today\u2019s US GDP report, due in 15 minutes. They include: Did the economy bounce back from the devastation caused by the hurricane season? Hurricanes Harvey and Irma probably slowed America\u2019s growth during the quarter Did consumer spending remain robust? The WSJ suspects it may have slowed, as \u201cAmericans generally don\u2019t go out shopping or dining during hurricanes\u201d. Did businesses keep investing? A strong reading would suggest firms are confident about their future prospects Are US exports growing? The world economy seems to be strengthening, so US firms should be taking advantage and selling more overseas. Analysts at ING predict a strong US growth report: Excitement is building on Wall Street as traders wait nervously to learn how America\u2019s economy fared in the third quarter of 2017. As explained in the introduction, economists predict that US GDP expanded at an annualised pace of 2.5% in July-September (the equivalent of growing by 0.6% during the quarter). That would be a small slowdown in growth after a strong second quarter, but still a fairly solid result. The data could help determine whether US interest rates are raised again this year. Craig Erlam, analyst at City firm OANDA, explains: The economy performed very well in the second quarter and another strong number is expected today, which will only increase the likelihood that the Fed raises interest rates at the December meeting. While there\u2019s no room for manoeuvre on this for the December meeting \u2013 a rate hike is fully priced in \u2013 there\u2019s plenty of room next year with markets severely under-pricing the three hikes the Fed has projected for 2018. Newsflash: US department store chain J. C. Penney has issued a profits warning \u2013 a timely example of how traditional retailers are struggling in the face of Amazon. The company, which runs more than 1,000 stores in shopping malls across America, has slashed its earnings forecast for 2017. J. C.Penney revealed that it had been forced to slash prices, particularly for women\u2019s clothes, to stimulate sales in September and October. That has taken a big slice out of its company\u2019s profitability. Shares have plunged by 15% in pre-market trading. Rival retailers Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s are also dropping, on fears that the US retail sector is slowing (unless you\u2019re Amazon, of course...). Newsflash from Moscow: The Bank of Russia has cut interest rates, by a quarter-point, to 8.25%. Russian interest rates have been cut steadily this year, having been hiked to an eye-watering 11% in 2015 as central bankers tried to get inflation under control and support the rouble. Last night\u2019s financial results are calming worries that technology companies had become dangerously overvalued. The rally in the US stock markets this year has been partly driven by the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google). Those stocks had fallen in recent days, on fears that investors had got carried away. But the news that Amazon and Alphabet both posted such strong revenue and profit growth suggests that Wall Street was right all along, and hadn\u2019t overvalued the tech sector. Thomas Fitzgerald, associate fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management, says: \u201cAlphabet reported an impressive set of results on Thursday evening, beating consensus expectations on every measure and delivering top-line growth in excess of 20% for the sixth straight quarter. The results were driven by strength in both core mobile and desktop search, \u2018phenomenal growth\u2019 from YouTube and further momentum in cloud services. \u201cOverall, the results reinforce our positive view on the company, as it continually adapts to a rapidly evolving computing environment, while leveraging advanced A.I. and machine learning capabilities to sustain a high level of growth. Jeff Bezos might wrestle the title of the world\u2019s richest person back from Bill Gates today, depending how Amazon and Microsoft\u2019s shares perform today. The 8.5% surge in Amazon\u2019s shares in after-hours trading swelled Bezos\u2019s fortune by over $6bn. That could be enough to put Bezos top of the pile. Bloomberg has the details: Gates ended Thursday with a net worth of $87.9 billion, about $4.5 billion ahead of Bezos. Gates has been the world\u2019s richest person since 2013, though he briefly slipped behind Bezos during intraday trading on July 27. Gates ended that day on top. The race is only close, though, because Gates has given away tens of billions of dollars over the years - including a $4.6bn donation in August.

The Competition and Markets Authority fears that customers are being unfairly pressured into making a booking, by warnings about how many (or few) rooms are left or how long a price might be available for. Here\u2019s the full story: Woosh! European stock markets have hit a five-month high this morning as last night\u2019s US tech results create an upbeat mood. Technology stocks, and consumer-focused companies, are leading the rally this morning. Stocks are also benefitting from the drop in the euro yesterday, after the European Central Bank extended its bond-buying stimulus scheme by another nine months (at least). Alphabet\u2019s results are also being cheered by technology analysts. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Bergen: Alphabet Inc. beat projections for third-quarter sales and earnings after a surge in Google ad volume helped the web-search giant shrug off concerns about regulatory scrutiny and an expensive foray into hardware. Sales for the quarter rose to $22.27 billion and profit was $9.57 a share, the company said. Analysts on average estimated sales of $22 billion on earnings of $8.34 a share. Executives lauded \u201ctremendous results\u201d in mobile search ads. Yet the company cautioned investors the biggest costs that come with those ads -- fees paid to distribution partners -- will continue to rise, along with expenses from Google\u2019s foray into devices and holiday-season marketing. \u201cWe had a terrific quarter, with revenues up 24% year on year, reflecting strength across Google and Other Bets,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in the statement. It\u2019s the first time in an earnings release that the CFO praised Alphabet\u2019s non-Google units, in self-driving cars and other experimental fields, which sharply curbed their costs during the quarter. James Cordwell, an analyst at Atlantic Equities, says: TAC [ Traffic acquisition costs] is surging, but the trade-off between growth and margin is a good one, with overall gross profit dollars still growing in excess of 20 percent. Over on Quartz, Mike Murphy points out that Google provided the bulk of Alphabet\u2019s revenues Time is a flat circle. Alphabet announced its third-quarter earnings today (Oct. 26), and yet again, it brought in a ton of cash, almost entirely from Google\u2019s advertising business. The company generated $27.8 billion in revenue, up 24% from the same quarter last year, making this Alphabet\u2019s highest-revenue quarter ever. (The previous record was $26.06 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.) Roughly $24.1 billion of that revenue, or about 87%, came from Google\u2019s ad sales. Here\u2019s some reaction to Amazon\u2019s forecast-smashing results. The FT\u2019s Anna Nicolaou: Amazon grew quarterly sales by more than a third, helping the company turn a profit even as it spends heavily to disrupt industries ranging from groceries to logistics and television shows. Shares jumped more than 8 per cent to $1,040 a share in extended trading, as the company led by billionaire Jeff Bezos reported that sales jumped 34 per cent to $43.7bn in the three months to the end of September. This handily topped Amazon\u2019s own forecast and consensus estimates for $42.1bn, and outpaced growth of 25 per cent last quarter. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter: \u201cThis company has finally gotten itself to the point where it can sustain its spending growth and still leave some crumbs for shareholders.\u201d Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos: \u201cThey are firing on all cylinders. The machine is churning,\u201d The BBC\u2019s technology correspondent, Rory Cellan-Jones, is also impressed: Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel collectively hauled in roughly $2.2bn more profit and $19bn more revenue than in the same quarter a year ago. That\u2019s according to Marketwatch\u2019s Jeremy Owens, who adds: Alphabet had perhaps the most astounding beat of the afternoon, as profit rose $1.12 billion and revenue $9.5 billion from a year before. The Google parent company reported third-quarter net income of $6.73 billion, or $9.57 a share, on revenue of $27.8 billion. That performance destroyed forecasts, as analysts on average expected Alphabet to report earnings of $8.31 a share on revenue of $26.9 billion. Over in Japan, the Nikkei stock index has surged by over 1% to a fresh 21-year high following last night\u2019s blisteringly good results from Alphabet, Amazon et al. Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities, says investors are in an optimistic mood: \u201cCorporate earnings are rising to record levels in the world. And the IMF just upgraded its economic forecast for all of U.S., China, Europe and Japan. World stock markets are upbeat this morning after the world\u2019s largest technology companies smashed forecasts last night. Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft all outperformed Wall Street expectations with their latest financial results, sparking a rally in Asia -- and potentially sending US stocks to fresh record highs later today. Amazon posted a 34% (!) rise in revenues during the last quarter, to $43.7bn, partly due to its recent acquisition of Whole Foods. That beat forecasts of $42.1bn. And despite investing heavily, the online retail giant also posted net earnings of $256m or 52 cents per share -- compared to forecasts of just 3 cents. The results sent Amazon\u2019s shares soaring by 7% in after-hours trading, popping over the $1,000 mark. Alphabet\u2019s shares are also poised to vault over the $1,000 mark when trading begins in New York later today. Its earnings spiked by 32% during the quarter, to $9.57 a share, beating forecasts of $8.35. Revenues beat forecasts too - rising to $27.77bn, ahead of forecasts of $27.2bn. CNBC explains: Ad prices went down more than expected during the quarter, and traffic costs were higher than forecast \u2014 but revenue was boosted by a higher-than-predicted surge in the volume of clicks on Google ads across the world, especially in Asia. Microsoft, too, had a good quarter, partly to strong demand for its cloud services operation. Revenue from the Office 365 cloud productivity suite jumped 42% year-on-year, helping to drive total revenue to $24.5bn, compared to $23.56bn expected. That drove Microsoft\u2019s share to an all-time high in after-hours trading. Microchip maker Intel and social media network Twitter also beat forecasts yesterday, suggesting that the tech boom isn\u2019t fading. Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are all among the world\u2019s five largest companies, so these results have cheered investors. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We get a new insight into the health of the world\u2019s largest economy today, when preliminary US GDP figures are released. Analysts predict that America\u2019s economy grew by around 0.6% during the quarter, giving an annualised growth rate of around 2.5%. That would be a small decline on the 3.1% recorded in the April-June quarter A strong reading would bolster confidence in the health of the global economy, but it\u2019s possible that today\u2019s data will be distorted by the hurricane season. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada predicts that US companies hiked their spending on new equipment and buildings and stocked up on more raw materials, in a sign of confidence. Cole says: Look for a sharp inventory swing to contribute a sizeable amount to the sequential change (just over 0.5ppt) while capex investment should also look firm (adding another 0.5ppt, possibly more after this week\u2019s durables release). Otherwise it\u2019s a fairly quiet day... Here\u2019s the agenda: 8.15am BST: Peter Praet, the ECB\u2019s chief economist, speaks a a conference on financial market policy in Frankfurt. 1.30pm BST: US GDP report released.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe are the controllers of the funfair, of the rabbit hole ... of the dreams,\u201d cries an eccentrically costumed showman as a three-dimensional kaleidoscope whirls into life. The ride is one of the Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland-themed theatrical \u201cexperiences\u201d designed to inject some pizzazz into the opening of Westgate Oxford, the \u00a3440m shopping centre that has replaced the city\u2019s rundown 1970s scheme. The spinning wall of coloured mirrors has a dizzying effect; when the ride ends, you stumble out blinking like a modern-day Alice. It\u2019s not Wonderland \u2013 the huge John Lewis in front of you confirms that. Rather, you have entered the realm of \u201cshoppertainment\u201d, a brave new world where retailers aren\u2019t just in the business of trying to sell stuff \u2013 they are also in showbusiness. The more than 300 staff at Westgate\u2019s John Lewis have been put through their paces by the Oxford Playhouse theatre. The acting lessons, which included voice coaching and body language skills, are part of new John Lewis boss Paula Nickolds\u2019 bold plan to \u201creinvent the department store for the 21st century\u201d. Simon Tavener, secretary of the Oxford Theatre Guild, says it\u2019s useful for retail staff to find their \u201ccharacter\u201d, adding: \u201cYou need to put on a face and adjust your performance to suit [the customers\u2019] needs and wants. \u2018\u2018Selling requires you to have a sort of script in your head,\u201d Tavener says. \u201cNot one you recite, but one you tailor to your own voice ... a form of improv, if you like.\u201d John Lewis\u2019s new Oxford shop is \u201cmore than a route to selling things\u201d, according to Nickolds, who has turned over a fifth of the 120,000 sq ft selling space to 21 \u201cservices and experiences\u201d, ranging from style advice to personalised Christmas baubles. The retail theatre is stage-managed via an \u201cexperience desk\u201d where shoppers can plan their itinerary. One option packs personal shopping, a manicure, a light lunch at Benugo and a Charlotte Tilbury makeover into a five-hour spree. Given the store\u2019s \u00a318m cost, the last entry on the agenda is, of course, \u201cHead to customer collections to collect your purchases\u201d. Shoppers hungry for experiences have plenty of other options. In the nearby Nespresso store, fans of its pod coffee machines are invited to sit down and literally smell the coffee. Staff are coffee specialists who deliver the \u201cultimate coffee experience\u201d, and the store\u2019s props include an atelier table where shoppers can take masterclasses. Westgate Oxford took nearly 20 years and three sets of developers to complete, despite the fact that major retailers were desperate for modern units rather than the more traditional style of shop the historic centre of Oxford is famous for. The 800,000 sq ft mall, a joint venture between Landsec and the Crown Estate, is now 93% let. Despite the uncertainty created by Brexit, Landsec\u2019s Scott Parsons says there was still plenty of interest from retailers. But he admits that \u201cgetting some deals across the line took a bit more time. Retailers were being a bit more cautious and going back to their boards for approval.\u201d On Thursday, the CBI\u2019s monthly retail survey provided a grim snapshot of high street trading, with sales falling at their fastest rate since the height of the financial crisis. On the same day, Debenhams reported a 44% slide in pre-tax profits to \u00a359m, dragged down by \u00a336.2m of exceptionals as it marked down the value of its worst performing stores. All the major department store chains are trying to give their stores a raison d\u2019\u00eatre in the internet age. Retail theatre was pioneered by famous London department stores such as Selfridges, although its efforts reached parody levels earlier this year when it ran potato peeling workshops to help stressed-out consumers \u201creconnect\u201d with themselves. The chief executive of Debenhams, Sergio Bucher, has coined the term \u201csocial shopping\u201d and is trying to make visits to stores a \u201cfun leisure activity\u201d. Bucher, who joined from Amazon last year, wants to turn functional trips to pick up internet orders into experiences by combining the collection with a consultation with a personal shopper and a glass of prosecco. Bucher is also trying to inject some showbiz into stores via X Factor-style auditions for staff at Debenhams\u2019 recently opened retail park store in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. The shop\u2019s stock room is known as \u201cbackstage\u201d and a sign by the door leading to the shop floor says \u201cSmile, you are on\u201d. \u201cWe want to have people on the sales floor who love working there,\u201d says Bucher. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to harass customers, but want to be part of this fun activity called shopping.\u201d The GlobalData analyst Maureen Hinton says these store investment programmes are a bet on the experience economy as Britons spend more on leisure, travel and entertainment pursuits. \u201cThe beauty industry is also benefiting from consumers\u2019 greater interest in how they look \u2013 you\u2019ve got to look good in selfies \u2013 as well as health and wellbeing,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is a way of tapping into that and getting them to come to your store and hopefully spend on other products. However, I do wonder how profitable this is for retailers. \u201cIn a way, department stores are returning to the old version of themselves, where you could go to a hair salon, beauty room and the restaurant and have stuff delivered to your home,\u201d adds Hinton. \u201cThis is what the original Selfridges, Harrods, and probably Dickins &amp; Jones were like.\u201d Back in John Lewis\u2019s Christmas shop, Joyce is deciding whether to splash out on an \u00a38 plastic unicorn for her tree. She is steering clear of the experience desk, but has already bought an oven and a laptop, persuaded by the chain\u2019s \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d pledge. With a tight budget, she has no plans to splash out on a beauty treatment. \u201cOh, no,\u201d she says. \u201cI only buy cheap Rimmels in Superdrug.\u201d But downstairs, a row of women with beatific expressions on their faces are having their nails buffed and polished in full view of passing shoppers. One is sipping prosecco. They are living the 21st-century department store dream.",

Retail theatre was pioneered by famous London department stores such as Selfridges, although its efforts reached parody levels earlier this year when it ran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/06/stressed-shoppers-calm-down-by-learning-how-to-peel-a-potato\">potato peeling workshops</a> to help stressed-out consumers \u201creconnect\u201d with themselves.</p> <p>The chief executive of Debenhams, Sergio Bucher, has coined the term \u201csocial shopping\u201d and is trying to make visits to stores a \u201cfun leisure activity\u201d. Bucher, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/26/debenhams-hires-amazons-sergio-bucher-as-new-chief-executive\">who joined from Amazon</a> last year, wants to turn functional trips to pick up internet orders into experiences by combining the collection with a consultation with a personal shopper and a glass of prosecco.</p> <p>Bucher is also trying to inject some showbiz into stores via X Factor-style auditions for staff at Debenhams\u2019 recently opened retail park store in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. The shop\u2019s stock room is known as \u201cbackstage\u201d and a sign by the door leading to the shop floor says \u201cSmile, you are on\u201d. \u201cWe want to have people on the sales floor who love working there,\u201d says Bucher. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to harass customers, but want to be part of this fun activity called shopping.\u201d</p> <p>The GlobalData analyst Maureen Hinton says these store investment programmes are a bet on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/06/the-way-we-shop-now-the-revolution-in-british-spending-habits\">experience economy</a> as Britons spend more on leisure, travel and entertainment pursuits. </p> <p>\u201cThe beauty industry is also benefiting from consumers\u2019 greater interest in how they look \u2013 you\u2019ve got to look good in selfies \u2013 as well as health and wellbeing,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is a way of tapping into that and getting them to come to your store and hopefully spend on other products.

      "bodyText": "The US economy shook off the impact of two major hurricanes in the third quarter growing at a robust 3%, the commerce department reported Friday. Steady spending from consumers and businesses over the quarter helped the economy to beat economic forecasts of 2.5% annual growth and came despite a dramatic slump in hiring in the wake of hurricanes Irma and Harvey. The two hurricanes caused massive damage in Texas and Florida during August and September and were cited by the labor department as a major factor in the US economy losing 33,000 jobs in September, the first time in seven years that the economy had recorded a monthly fall in employment. Houston\u2019s metropolitan area, which bore the brunt of hurricane Harvey, is the country\u2019s s fifth largest, and accounts for 3% of national economic output. The impact of the storms on gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of economic health, is still being weighed. But the bad jobs report was regarded as a storm-related anomaly by most economists and the stock markets have continued to hit record highs. The commerce department said the storms probably suppressed business activity in areas including oil and gas extraction in Texas and agriculture production in Florida but added \u201cit is not possible to estimate the overall impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma on 2017 third-quarter GDP\u201d. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of US GDP, gew at 2.4% over the quarter, below recent reports, and may have been suppressed by the storms. But businesses continued to spend robustly with nonresidential fixed investment growing at a 3.9% rate in the third quarter. Exports were weaker and grew at a 2.3% pace while government spending fell at a 0.1% rate. \u201cThe 3.0% annualised gain in third-quarter GDP, which was almost unchanged from the 3.1% increase in the second, will be welcomed by the White House and demonstrates that the hurricanes ended up having little lasting impact on the economy,\u201d Capital Economics said in a note. While some economists argue that maintaining 3% growth may be difficult given the US\u2019s aging workforce and slowing productivity, the figures are likely to add to the Federal Reserve\u2019s determination to increase rates at its next meeting in December and come as the Trump administration is pushing through a radical overhaul of the tax system which it argues will further spur growth. That assumption has been challenged by Democrats and many economists.",

One in five British adults surveyed by the Halifax bank expect house prices will fall in the next year, in the weakest reading for consumer expectations since October 2012. Young people under the age of 25 and those living in London are found to be least optimistic. The drop off in confidence comes amid growing concerns over the strength of the economy, with rising inflation and weak wage growth putting pressure on British households. It also comes as the Bank of England prepares to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade from as early as next week. Despite the looming increase in the cost of borrowing, gathering a deposit is viewed as the biggest barrier to buying a home. According to the survey of almost 2,000 British adults, almost two-thirds see this as the main barrier, whereas just 15% worrying about the availability of mortgages or concerns about higher interest rates. Of the 535 mortgage holders questioned in the survey, only a third said they were anxious about rising interest rates affecting their ability to meet repayments. This was down from 42% in 2014. The survey also shows concerns over personal finances rising up the list of potential barriers, while job security was found to be a major worry among those looking to buy a home. The average house price stood at \u00a3222,293 in August. The lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-70s are still failing to boost the bargaining power of employees in the UK, according to the latest official figures. When taking account of inflation, real wages fell by 0.4% in the three months to August, the sixth consecutive month of negative earnings. London was the only region in the Halifax survey where the balance of people thought it was a bad time to buy, with those in the West Midlands and Wales the most positive. Those aged between 16 and 24 were the only age group with a negative buying outlook, while those over 65 were the most positive. Across the UK about half of those surveyed thought it would be a good time to buy. Russell Galley of Halifax said: \u201cHousing market optimism has declined significantly over the past year, with almost half of people expecting a general slowdown in the market.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has reported three consecutive quarters of profits but says it is on track to report its 10th consecutive full-year loss as a result of a US penalty over toxic bond mis-selling that dates back to before the banking crisis. The yet-to-be-quantified settlement with the US Department of Justice over the way mortgage bonds were packaged and sold to investors in the run-up to 2008 means that the 71% UK taxpayer-owned bank is braced for a multibillion-pound bill in the last three months of the financial year. Ross McEwan, the RBS chief executive, said this meant it was unlikely that the Edinburgh-based bank, which received a \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout, would make a full-year profit. McEwan \u2013 a New Zealander who has run the bank since 2013 \u2013 said the bank was reporting \u201cgood results\u201d with \u00a31.3bn of profits for the first nine months of the year. In the same period a year ago it recorded a \u00a32.5bn loss. \u201cWe\u2019ve almost got ourselves through our legacy cleanup,\u201d said McEwan. The results justified his strategy to focus RBS on the UK and pull back from investment banking, he added. \u201cWe have grown income, reduced costs, made better use of our capital and continued to make progress on our legacy conduct issues. Our core bank continues to generate strong profits and we remain on track to hit our financial targets,\u201d McEwan said. The bank has been awaiting a settlement with the DoJ for years and McEwan said he was optimistic of achieving one this year. Last December the DoJ extracted $12.5bn (\u00a39.5bn) settlements from Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse over residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) sold before 2008. On Thursday, the DoJ fined RBS \u00a333m over allegations it lied to clients over prices and commissions paid for RMBS. It said the bank \u201cencouraged fraudulent trading practices\u201d and prevented \u201cvictims and honest RBS employees from discovering and exposing the scheme\u201d. The RMBS settlement \u2013 which could reach \u00a39bn \u2013 could remove uncertainty and give the British government an opportunity to start selling off its shares, McEwan said. The shares rose almost 3% to 288p, still way below the average 502p per share the taxpayer paid during the 2008 bailout. Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital, said that once the settlement was reached \u201cit should pave the way for the group to return to statutory profitability (hopefully during 2018) and, ultimately, recommence dividend payments and capital returns to shareholders\u201d. With the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates next week for the first time since July 2007, McEwan said it would be good news for savers and that 88% of its customers were on fixed-rate mortgages. McEwan has previously said he is cautious about the consumer credit market \u2013 credit cards, motor finance and personal loans \u2013 which is growing at 10% year at a time when incomes are growing at 2%. Last month, he said he was postponing a fresh push into the credit card market. RBS has been under fire for its treatment of small business customers and the Financial Conduct Authority said earlier this week it was looking at whether it could take action against the bank over customers in its now defunct global restructuring group (GRG). It has also faced fresh controversy after Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money, recalled an incident when she worked at RBS where a female colleague believed she was expected to sleep with her manager. Gadhia quit RBS in 2006. McEwan said it was \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s why we\u2019re changing the culture\u201d.",

The first and best-known publicly owned energy companies, Robin Hood Energy in Nottingham and Bristol Energy, started two years ago. But the growing trend came to the fore this month when Nicola Sturgeon promised to create a Scottish public energy company by 2021. \u201cNo shareholders to worry about. No corporate bonuses to consider. It would give people \u2013 particularly those on low incomes \u2013 more choice and the option of a supplier whose only job is to secure the lowest price for consumers,\u201d Scotland\u2019s first minister said, in an echo of the marketing used by the councils who have already started their own energy companies. Sturgeon\u2019s firm will be entering an increasingly crowded space: publicly owned firms include Liverpool\u2019s Leccy, Derby\u2019s Ram, and Leeds\u2019 White Rose. Councils in Sussex are clubbing together to launch Your Energy Sussex latter this year. The driving forces for these councils stepping into the complex, heavily regulated energy space are largely twofold. One is the need to create a new revenue stream in a time of austerity, as well as rebuilding the public sphere \u2013 councils are perhaps most visible to residents when they close libraries and cut other services. But there is also a political project afoot as well, as Labour-controlled councils such as Nottingham push an agenda that has since been picked up by Jeremy Corbyn during the last election. There is also genuine concern over fuel poverty, and a hope that local authorities will be more trusted than the usual energy suppliers, that even Theresa May says have ripped customers off. \u201cIt\u2019s about councils trying to provide a trusted and better service for people to switch. We want a challenger model to the big six,\u201d said Labour MP Caroline Flint, whose Doncaster constituency will see the launch of publicly owned Great Northern Energy on 7 November. The flurry of such firms showed Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge of a publicly owned energy supplier in each region was happening regardless of the party\u2019s failure to win power in June\u2019s snap general election, Flint said. Tackling the growing amount of households in fuel poverty, which number 2.5 million in England and Wales, is another big motivation. Steve Battlemuch, chair of the board of Robin Hood Energy and a Labour councillor, said: \u201cNottingham has a lot of fuel poverty, lot of people on prepayment meters [which people in energy debt are often moved on to]. That was what drove us: coming into the market and driving down prices for the customer.\u201d Like other public firms, part of his sales pitch is that there are no corporate masters to pay. \u201cThere\u2019s no shareholder bonuses, because there\u2019s no shareholder apart from Nottingham city council. There\u2019s no director bonuses. I had a cupcake on our first anniversary,\u201d he said. Peter Haigh, managing director of Bristol Energy, said his organisation was more inclusive than private companies, and its physical presence in the city was a big attraction. \u201cCustomers can and do walk in, sign up and pay a bill. That often attracts customers who have never switched, people who can pop in face to face,\u201d he said. Part of the reason councils are getting into energy is the barriers to market are not as great as they once were. Mark Coyle, strategy director of Utiligroup, which has provided services to most of the publicly owned energy companies, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to lower the barriers for them, without lowering compliance.\u201d But while the sector appears to be burgeoning, combined these companies are a minnow compared with the blue whales that are the big six firms, which between them account for 80% share of the market. Bristol Energy is biggest publicly owned energy supplier, with about 110,000 customers; Robin Hood has just over 100,000. Both have created more than 100 jobs locally, but neither has yet recovered their start-up costs. Moreover, while such firms appear to be proliferating, most are simply rebranding off Robin Hood rather than setting up as fully licensed suppliers which can buy energy on the wholesale market. The approach has its critics. \u201cIslington are doing a good thing but it\u2019s a shame that they\u2019ve had to go to Nottingham to buy the energy,\u201d said Caroline Russell, a Green party London assembly member. Sadiq Khan, London\u2019s mayor, has promised to create an energy company for Londoners, but has been slow to deliver. Last month he was advised by experts to piggyback off an existing supplier, rather than create his own licensed company. While cheaper and quicker to do, it would also mean he had less power and flexibility to offer something genuinely new and different compared with the 50-plus private firms already in the market. Nigel Cornwall, founder of energy analysts Cornwall Insight, said that while he was supportive of publicly owned energy companies, it was revealing that many councils were opting to ride on Robin Hood\u2019s coat-tails rather than set up their own licensed firm. \u201cThis is high-risk stuff. The sector is complicated. You [the council] probably don\u2019t have the resources. You\u2019ve probably underestimated the costs. And that\u2019s with costs of entry falling dramatically,\u201d he said. Cornwall said he was also sceptical as to whether the companies would be sustainable and would become a permanent fixture in the market \u2013 but that would not stop them trying. Battlemuch said: \u201cWhat we need to do is break through into the mass market. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d",
