      "bodyText": "The mystery in the great Glencore-Xstrata saga is why Ivan Glasenberg allowed himself to be bounced into structuring the deal as a scheme of arrangement, thereby setting a threshold for victory of 75% approval from non-Glencore shareholders. Such a high hurdle opened the door for a deep-pocketed sovereign wealth fund - Qatar Holding - to gobble almost 12% of Xstrata and thereby achieve a blocking stake. Over-confidence must be part of the explanation. Glasenberg didn't see Qatar coming (to be fair, nor did anybody else). He thought he would be dealing with the usual pusillanimous collection of fund managers who roll over in the end when even a modest takeover premium is on the table. And he assumed almost everybody would recognise the supposed inevitability of the two companies combining. After all, Glencore owns 35% of Xstrata and the combination had been talked about for years as the only logical resolution of the ownership tension. Glasenberg must now confront the consequences of his embarrassing miscalculation. The current proposed deal - 2.8 Glencore shares for every Xstrata share - is clearly dead in the water. The Qataris won't bite at that price and nor, for good measure, will Norges Bank, Standard Life, Schroders and Knight Vinke among other Xstrata shareholders. Glasenberg hasn't yet declared the 2.8 ratio to be final so there remains the possibility he will unveil an eleventh-hour sweetener before the vote a week on Friday . But it's not the way to bet. The Qataris want 3.25 and it's hard to imagine Glasenberg going close to that level given that Xstrata's shares now trade at just 2.5 times. The loss of face would be immense. Instead, Glasenberg's strategy seems to be play down the need to gain approval next week (\"If it does not happen \u2013 no big deal,\" he said last week) and talk up the chances of returning another day. The trouble is, a re-run is easier to imagine in theory than in practice. The Qataris' investment in Xstrata has been imperfectly timed (they've bought a big stake just as the commodity cycle is turning downwards) but one must assume they are prepared for a long haul. They, like other refuseniks among Xstrata shareholders, may be dreaming of the day when their company spits out $6bn (\u00a33.8bn) a year in cash after its heavy investment over the past few years. If that's the gamble, there's no point giving up on the dream after a year or two of weak commodity prices. Mining is a long-term business. If the Qataris think a 3.25 ratio is the minimum requirement today, they will probably stick to that line for a long time yet. They may also insist that Xstrata replace Sir John Bond with a new chairman who shares their view on valuation. Of course, Glencore's acquisition currency - its shares - could also outperform Xstrata's in future, which would oil the arithmetic of a new all-share offer. But, given that the Xstrata shareholding contributes almost 40% of Glencore's profits, massive divergence is hard to achieve. Glencore's unique trading arm would have to fulfil all the hype about its counter-cyclical resilience. That could happen (and last week's numbers were useful early evidence) but it will take at least a couple of years for doubters on the Xstrata register to abandon their view that profits from trading commodities just aren't of the same quality as profits from digging stuff out of the ground. Mega-deals that fall apart at the first attempt do sometimes return. Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKlineBeecham did the deed two years after their first fumble in 1998. And one can't ignore the fact that Glencore will continue to own 35% of Xstrata, which is a mighty strong starting position. But even two years is a long time in the feast-to-famine mining game. One suspects that Glasenberg's best chance of bagging his prey may be about to come and go.",

In the 1970s it was gold; in the 1980s it was the Nikkei, and in the 1990s it was the Nasdaq. Bigger than all of them, though, has been the iron ore bubble, a tenfold increase in prices in less than a decade. Iron ore is the raw material for steel, production of which has rocketed as a result of China's economic boom. Consider the following facts. In the past 15 years, China has built 90 million new homes \u2013 enough to house the populations of the UK, France and Germany combined. A quarter of global steel demand is for Chinese property and Chinese infrastructure. Commodity-rich countries, like Australia, have never had it so good. China takes 25% of Australia's exports and iron ore accounts for 60% of all the goods Australia sells to China. One reason Australia avoided recession during the global downturn of 2008-09 was that it had a well-run banking system. A much bigger reason was that the country had become a giant pit from which China could extract the minerals it needed for its industrial expansion. Money flooded into the country from sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds looking for AAA investments. The Australian dollar has soared, as have property prices. China's economy is now slowing, and although the economic data is not particularly reliable, it seems to be slowing fast. The country has two million unsold homes, with another 30 million under construction. There is a glut of iron ore and the price is falling. Where does that leave Australia? Horribly exposed, quite obviously. It has an over-valued currency, an over-valued property market, and its major customer is now desperately pulling every available policy lever in the hope of avoiding a hard landing. Whatever happens, the Australian dollar is a sell. Just how big a sell will depend on how successful Beijing is in reflating the Chinese economy.",

As open access journals gain traction, we see open access article processing fees increasing and envisage that open access revenues (where Reed has already an established position) can compensate for any subscription journal revenue pressure. <br> We think the company has turned the corner and see a two-leg story developing.

      "bodyText": "Reed Elsevier has been facing some concerns about the impact of open access publishing on its business, but analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove reckon the threat has been overdone. They raised their rating on Reed from neutral to overweight, saying: Despite much news flow around open access publishing, we expect open access initiatives to have little or no impact on Reed's Science and Health revenues and profits. As open access journals gain traction, we see open access article processing fees increasing and envisage that open access revenues (where Reed has already an established position) can compensate for any subscription journal revenue pressure. We think the company has turned the corner and see a two-leg story developing.

A spokeswoman explained: \"The grottos are just a bit of fun as part of promotion for our Christmas savings cards.

With Britain back in recession, Asda expects people to save even more this Christmas. Research commissioned by the supermarket chain showed that almost half of mothers were more worried about the cost of Christmas this year than in 2011. While nearly a third have already started saving for the festive period, almost one in four will be spending less this year. Rising prices and stagnating wages have eaten into household budgets. Sainsbury's and Tesco do not have Christmas savings cards, but Tesco customers can request to have all Clubcard vouchers sent to them at Christmas, rather than spread across the year.",

Mitt Romney's aim will be to brand Barack Obama a failure for his stewardship and to argue that Americans would be better off electing a Republican who knows something about business.</p> <p>The team at CMC Markets set out to test this assumption by analysing stock market returns under every president since 1900. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ_CWFjFrvw\" title=\"\">A YouTube presentation of the report</a> shows that as far as Wall Street is concerned, it is better to vote Democrat. The average monthly return on the stock market has been 0.73% under Democrat presidents, almost double the 0.38% under Republicans.</p> <p>Returns were highest under Calvin Coolidge, a Republican president during the Roaring 20s, when the stock market boomed ahead of the Wall Street Crash. But the next two presidents in the league table were Democrats \u2013 Bill Clinton and Franklin Roosevelt. Obama's performance, using this yardstick of economic health, has been above average \u2013 only slightly below that of Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.</p> <p>Normally higher stock market returns would be associated with higher levels of risk. But when adjusted for volatility, Democrat presidents still come out comfortably on top.</p> <p>The good news for Obama is that incumbent presidents who have presided over strong stock market returns in their first term usually get re-elected. This was true of FDR, Eisenhower, Reagan and Clinton. The bad news is that the pattern does not always hold true. Wall Street did well under George Bush senior but that didn't stop him being a one-term president.

      "bodyText": "As ever, the economy will be the key issue in the US presidential race. Mitt Romney's aim will be to brand Barack Obama a failure for his stewardship and to argue that Americans would be better off electing a Republican who knows something about business. The team at CMC Markets set out to test this assumption by analysing stock market returns under every president since 1900. A YouTube presentation of the report shows that as far as Wall Street is concerned, it is better to vote Democrat. The average monthly return on the stock market has been 0.73% under Democrat presidents, almost double the 0.38% under Republicans. Returns were highest under Calvin Coolidge, a Republican president during the Roaring 20s, when the stock market boomed ahead of the Wall Street Crash. But the next two presidents in the league table were Democrats \u2013 Bill Clinton and Franklin Roosevelt. Obama's performance, using this yardstick of economic health, has been above average \u2013 only slightly below that of Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. Normally higher stock market returns would be associated with higher levels of risk. But when adjusted for volatility, Democrat presidents still come out comfortably on top. The good news for Obama is that incumbent presidents who have presided over strong stock market returns in their first term usually get re-elected. This was true of FDR, Eisenhower, Reagan and Clinton. The bad news is that the pattern does not always hold true. Wall Street did well under George Bush senior but that didn't stop him being a one-term president. It did badly under his son but George Bush junior still held off John Kerry in 2004. Studies of this sort inevitably only provide a partial impression of presidential economic records. A more comprehensive study would include unemployment, inflation, living standards and the distribution of the spoils of growth. It can also be said that, in some cases, a president can bequeath problems to his successor. Herbert Hoover was the worst president for Wall Street in the past 112 years, but he followed Coolidge. Similarly, it could be argued that the poor returns under George Bush junior reflected the unsustainable nature of the dotcom bubble under Clinton.

      "body": "<p>A day after G4S revealed the cost of its Olympic contract shambles, fellow outsourcer <strong>Serco</strong> revealed a drop in profits due to reorganisation costs and order delays.</p> <p>The company, whose contracts include the Docklands light railway in London, prisons and air traffic control centres, said half year profits fell from \u00a3123m to \u00a3102m before exceptional items. In the UK and Europe, revenues fell 1% following fewer contracts in the welfare to work market, while conditions in the US federal outsourcing markets remained difficult. Overall, first half like for like revenues fell by 2%.</p> <p>But the company was positive about the outlook, with its performance expected to be weighted to the second half and a rise in contract awards during the first half from \u00a32.5bn to \u00a34.2bn. It has identified \u00a331bn of further opportunities for the group. Chief executive Christopher Hyman said:</p> <blockquote> Our business in Australasia and the middle east continues to grow strongly and, while significant challenges in the US remain, we see conditions in the UK starting to improve. The recent level of new contract wins across the group will help us deliver the anticipated strong financial performance in the second half of the year. </blockquote> <p>This optimism has helped lift Serco's shares by 4p to 566.5p in a falling market. Analyst Robert Morton at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> Serco's interim results are well down on last year, reflecting a difficult trading background as well as a reorganisation programme. Cash generation in the first half was also disappointing, although there were timing elements within the shortfall.

      "bodyText": "A day after G4S revealed the cost of its Olympic contract shambles, fellow outsourcer Serco revealed a drop in profits due to reorganisation costs and order delays. The company, whose contracts include the Docklands light railway in London, prisons and air traffic control centres, said half year profits fell from \u00a3123m to \u00a3102m before exceptional items. In the UK and Europe, revenues fell 1% following fewer contracts in the welfare to work market, while conditions in the US federal outsourcing markets remained difficult. Overall, first half like for like revenues fell by 2%. But the company was positive about the outlook, with its performance expected to be weighted to the second half and a rise in contract awards during the first half from \u00a32.5bn to \u00a34.2bn. It has identified \u00a331bn of further opportunities for the group. Chief executive Christopher Hyman said: Our business in Australasia and the middle east continues to grow strongly and, while significant challenges in the US remain, we see conditions in the UK starting to improve. The recent level of new contract wins across the group will help us deliver the anticipated strong financial performance in the second half of the year. This optimism has helped lift Serco's shares by 4p to 566.5p in a falling market. Analyst Robert Morton at Investec said: Serco's interim results are well down on last year, reflecting a difficult trading background as well as a reorganisation programme. Cash generation in the first half was also disappointing, although there were timing elements within the shortfall. Negative organic growth in the first half is expected to reverse significantly in the second as a result of recent contract wins and the outlook for next year looks more encouraging, although in the short term the shares are likely to tread water. We remain buyers for the medium-term potential. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 23.50 points to 5752.21, with investors concerned about global growth prospects.
