      "bodyText": "The debate about house prices is reignited on Mondayamid claims by Britain's biggest property website that prices for homes have come \"off the boil\". For the first time this year, the asking prices posted on the Rightmove website for homes in London fell by 0.5% in early June, compared with the month before, in part due to a rapid increase in sellers rushing to cash in on rising prices. In some areas, especially in London, prices may have hit an \"affordability cap\", the website said. Rightmove added that asking prices have \"come off the boil\" and prices in England and Wales are at a virtual standstill, rising by just 0.1% \u2013 or \u00a3272 \u2013 on the previous month. On a year-on-year basis, though, prices in London are up 14.5% on a year ago, even after the slide in asking prices put on sale by estate agents compared to the month before. Even so Rightmove said the findings will come as a relief to the Bank of England ahead of the meeting of its policymaking body, the financial policy committee (FPC) this week. The rapid rise in house prices has been the subject of much debate, particularly since last week when chancellor George Osborne said he would give the FPC new powers to impose caps on the amounts banks and other lenders hand out for home loans compared with customers' incomes or the value of their property. While the FPC is not expected to use such powers immediately, the chancellor announced his intention to give the Bank of England additional scope over lending, just as the governor Mark Carney was warning interest rates could begin to rise from their historic low of 0.5% earlier than expected. Charlie Bean, the retiring deputy governor of the Bank, told the Sunday Times, that the first rate rise in five years would be a \"symbolic step because it will be an indication that we are on the road back to normality\". He added: \"Frankly, having interest rates at an emergency level for a very long time is not a situation one wants to be in.\" According to the Nationwide building society, house prices have reached their pre-crisis peak, with London driving the boom with annual price rises of 18%. Rightmovemeasures the asking price of houses, while Nationwide bases its findings on mortgages it approves each month. \"The London market powers the rest of the UK but is starting to run out of steam, said Miles Shipside, Rightmove's director and housing market analyst. \"While the legacy of rises in central London continues to ripple out to its better-value commuter belt, fuelling price increases in all southern regions, London itself is now marking time. It's an example to the rest of the country of what happens when affordability and common sense get stretched too far,\" he said. The housing market usually dips in June and the summer months but Rightmove said this month's slide was below the 0.6% average over the past 10 years. \"Some sellers will be looking to cash in and possibly get a lot more house for their money further out, but they may have missed the peak in the rush to realise their gains as parts of London appear to have hit the upper limit price buffer. \"This rise in the number of sellers has also been seen in the north and, when combined with this month's price falls in five out of six northern regions, should put paid to some of the ill-informed national bubble talk,\" said Shipside. He pointed to the introduction of the mortgage market review, which forces lenders to scrutinise borrowers' income and outgoings and check they can still afford repayments if interest rates started to rise. \"It is certainly causing a major headache for some estate agents with U-turns by lenders meaning sales falling through and heartache for buyers and sellers who thought they had a deal agreed,\" Shipside said.",

The current board comprises 15 members from seven regions that own 78% of the Co-op and five representatives of the independent societies that own the rest of the UK's largest mutual. Among the latest proposals being discussed, the board would have three directors nominated by the members, as well as independent directors, two executive directors \u2013 including the chief executive \u2013 and an independent chair. The structure of the Co-op Group board is being vigorously debated before a special general meeting due in early September to vote on specific reforms, which are needed in the wake of problems in its bank, in which it now owns just a 20% stake. While plans to push through corporate governance changes were passed at the Co-op's annual general meeting last month, they were based on four principles drawn from the Myners proposals and still need to be finalised. The principles were to create a board elected by members that is qualified to run a business the size of the Co-op, create a structure that gives the members powers to hold the board to account, establish a system of one member one vote and protect the Co-op against demutualisation. Myners left the board at the annual meeting after just five months, in the face of opposition to his proposals, while Ursula Lidbetter, the chair of the group who also runs the Lincolnshire Co-op, had promised members that Myners' plans were not \"stapled\" to the proposals being voted on at the meeting in May.

      "bodyText": "There is something predictable about the reaction of most British people to joining the sharing economy. They're not interested. Asked if they would rent out a room in their house, see their car disappear for a daily return of \u00a330 or lend someone their best suit or dress for cash, 63% told pollsters \"no thanks\". The survey found women in the UK were even more reluctant than men. Across southern Europe, a sense of desperation has turned millions of people to sharing, in a reversal of the proportion who say yes in the UK. Nielsen, which carried out an online global survey of 30,000 people, mused that British reserve may be at the root, combined with a relative wealth that makes sharing unnecessary. Yet the tide is turning, especially among young Britons, who the survey found were much more likely to embrace the idea. And why would they not be in favour of sharing when low and stagnant wages combined with a rising cost of living and weekly advances in mobile technology make it easier and potentially more profitable. The technology is already uprooting whole industries, such is its power. The strike last week by London black-cab drivers is likely to be the first of many protests by groups of workers fearful of being made redundant by sharing software. And is indicative of the pressure governments are under to rewrite rules made for the old economy. Uber is a mobile application that links self-employed drivers to customers without the need to hail a cab or phone a minicab. Its claim that it isn't a taxi firm, but a \"ride sharing\" company, doing little more than connecting drivers with passengers, appears to be in breach of London's rules protecting the metered black cab. A court ruling is pending. San Francisco-based Airbnb has fallen foul of tough laws in London that require landlords to apply for planning permission from the council to rent out their homes for less than three months. In response ministers have promised to sweep away the rule and allow homeowners a more flexible route to renting a room or the whole place as and when they don't need it for themselves. Zipcar, the car-club operator, is putting pressure on No 10 to classify its business as a form of public transport to exempt its charges from VAT. In a similar vein, a group of startup property consultants wants the government to change the way business rates are calculated to accommodate pop-up shops. At the moment a lease can be as long or short as a landlord likes, but a property must be unused for at least three months before it is exempt from business rates. Why not a weekly calculation for business rates relief, they ask. Other starlets on the widening stage of \"peer-to-peer\" websites include Zopa, which lends money directly to borrowers; EasyCar Club, which allows car owners to hire out their vehicle to a stranger; and sites such as Girl Meets Dress that allow customers to hire rather than buy a party dress. And for every entrepreneur who is looking to get rich quick, there is another, usually wealthy in their own right, giving away their software in the name of community or localism. In January, Lord Young welcomed many of these businesses to No 10 and praised them for bravely confronting outmoded means of production. He ditched the friendlier phrase \"creative disruption\" adopted by many sharing firms in favour of \"creative destruction\". Young, a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher, is the kind of free marketer who knows that big business can ossify an economy. Among 18th-century lords of the manor, he would have been the first to buy a threshing machine. Job destruction obviously displaces labour, but the sharing economy is absorbing some of them. Manpower, the recruitment agency, said last week that the rise of internet shopping and sharing via apps on mobile phones is triggering a shift in the transport industry. No longer are clothes and books making their way from large distribution centres to individual homes. Increasingly they are arriving at a local delivery hub to be taken to their destination by a self-employed driver who uses an app to log in and out of work. This rising tide of self-employment accounts for two out of five jobs created in the past year, pushing the number of people who work for themselves to one in seven of the workforce. While many will be self-employed out of necessity and earning, on average, about 40% less than their employed counterparts, a sizeable proportion consider themselves entrepreneurs and are excited about being their own boss. Analysis by the Royal Society of Arts shows that for every worker who loses out there are three who say they benefit. It is an entrepreneurialism that the RSA argued is indicative of an unstoppable shift . Respondents cited factors such as being able to live where they want and work around caring for older relatives or children. The rising cost of childcare was a key consideration, as was the escalating cost of commuting. Largely unspoken was the lack of pay, wage rises and decent pensions on offer in mainstream jobs culture. The tax system also encourages workers to look beyond the workplace for extra income. A combination of income tax and national insurance places a 32% marginal tax rate on standard rate taxpayers. Capital gains tax by contrast charges the basic rate taxpayer a rate of 18%, and a higher-rate taxpayer 28%. As such, gains on wealth are more lightly taxed than earned income. So there are signs that younger home buyers are calculating the gains from renting out a room when they calculate the affordability of a flat that might at first seem out of reach. What if, they ask themselves, they target areas near good transport, a tourist destination or amenities with a view to capitalising on the location by renting some or all of it out, at least for some of the year? There is some way to go, but this changing way of doing business is surely coming. British reluctance to share is certainly not matched unwillingness to trade stuff online. We are among the biggest eBay-ers in the world and Alibaba.com, the Chinese version of eBay for the business community, reports that UK members are among the biggest sellers on its site (most firms across Europe just seek to buy cheap Asian goods). Mobile phone use is high in the UK, social media is the cornerstone of many family communications and we are not far behind the US in adopting new ways of doing business online.",

No longer are clothes and books making their way from large distribution centres to individual homes.</p> <p>Increasingly they are arriving at a local delivery hub to be taken to their destination by a self-employed driver who uses an app to log in and out of work.</p> <p>This rising tide of self-employment accounts for two out of five jobs created in the past year, pushing the number of people who work for themselves to one in seven of the workforce. While many will be self-employed out of necessity and earning, on average, about 40% less than their employed counterparts, a sizeable proportion consider themselves entrepreneurs and are excited about being their own boss.</p> <p>Analysis by the Royal Society of Arts shows that for every worker who loses out there are three who say they benefit. It is an entrepreneurialism that the RSA argued is indicative of an unstoppable shift .</p> <p>Respondents cited factors such as being able to live where they want and work around caring for older relatives or children. The rising cost of childcare was a key consideration, as was the escalating cost of commuting.</p> <p>Largely unspoken was the lack of pay, wage rises and decent pensions on offer in mainstream jobs culture.</p> <p>The tax system also encourages workers to look beyond the workplace for extra income. A combination of income tax and national insurance places a 32% marginal tax rate on standard rate taxpayers. Capital gains tax by contrast charges the basic rate taxpayer a rate of 18%, and a higher-rate taxpayer 28%. As such, gains on wealth are more lightly taxed than earned income.</p> <p>So there are signs that younger home buyers are calculating the gains from renting out a room when they calculate the affordability of a flat that might at first seem out of reach. What if, they ask themselves, they target areas near good transport, a tourist destination or amenities with a view to capitalising on the location by renting some or all of it out, at least for some of the year?</p> <p>There is some way to go, but this changing way of doing business is surely coming. British reluctance to share is certainly not matched unwillingness to trade stuff online. We are among the biggest eBay-ers in the world and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/06/china-alibaba-us-ipo\" title=\"\">Alibaba.com, the Chinese version of eBay for the business community</a>, reports that UK members are among the biggest sellers on its site (most firms across Europe just seek to buy cheap Asian goods).</p> <p>Mobile phone use is high in the UK, social media is the cornerstone of many family communications and we are not far behind the US in adopting new ways of doing business online.</p>",
