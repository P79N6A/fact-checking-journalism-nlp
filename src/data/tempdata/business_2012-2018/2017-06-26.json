      "bodyText": "Asda has been named as the worst of the UK\u2019s major supermarkets in its treatment of suppliers. It dropped below Morrisons, which was bottom of the list last year, as the Bradford-based chain took action to improve its performance according to a survey of more than 1,200 grocery suppliers by the industry watchdog. About 12% of Asda\u2019s suppliers said the Walmart-owned chain rarely or never complied with the Grocery Supply Code of Practice, which covers dealings by 10 retailers that sell over \u00a31bn of groceries a year. It is understood that complaints were raised about Asda taking incorrect deductions from invoices without notice, requesting lump sums to make up profit margins, and conducting \u201cabusive\u201d forensic audits of suppliers\u2019 accounts. A spokesperson for Asda said: \u201cWe\u2019ve listened to the GCA and worked to improve our ways of working with suppliers to ensure we\u2019re doing our job in the best way we can. This includes ensuring our smaller suppliers are paid within 14 days, simplifying our processes, and eliminating some of our supplier charges and audits. We will also be introducing further changes, including the expansion of a dedicated helpdesk to ensure our suppliers have a single point of contact to raise any concerns.\u201d Christine Tacon, the grocery code adjudicator who enforces the rules and has the power to fine retailers, said that she was generally pleased with progress since she came into office four years ago. She said more suppliers were getting involved as they found that she was able to bring about real change in the grocery market. Overall, the proportion of suppliers who said they had a problem with breaches of the code fell to 56% from 62% last year. Incorrect deductions from invoices remain the top problem, affecting 32% of suppliers, followed by data input errors not being resolved promptly then unfair charges for packaging artwork. While Asda was worst of the major supermarket chains, Iceland was the worst retailer overall at complying with the code, according to the survey. However, Tacon said the chain had made improvements on many fronts. She said she had not received any specific complaints about Iceland breaching the code, but suppliers felt \u201cin a constant state of jeopardy\u201d in their dealings with the discounter. They feared that their products would be removed from its shelves if they took a wrong step. Iceland said it had the best score of all the retailers in terms of specific issues raised by suppliers despite its low ranking on overall compliance. A spokesman said: \u201cWe have worked hard to improve our compliance to achieve this, and feel sure that this will be acknowledged by our suppliers.\u201d The survey found that Aldi offered the best compliance with the code of practice for the fourth year in a row, followed by Sainsbury\u2019s.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Five months after a high court judge handed out lengthy jail terms to a group of financiers who left business owners \u201ccheated, defeated and penniless\u201d, only one of the victims of the HBOS fraud has received compensation. Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 which rescued HBOS in 2008 after the fraud took place \u2013 has set aside \u00a3100m for redress but now has little chance of meeting a month-end deadline it had set to make offers to all 64 victims. Instead the bank is mired in a public battle with TV celebrity Noel Edmonds \u2013 one of the victims \u2013 who accuses Lloyds of creating a \u201csham\u201d compensation process which lacks transparency. Edmonds is also calling on Professor Russel Griggs, the Scottish businessman appointed as independent reviewer of the compensation process, to quit. There are concerns that the \u00a3100m compensation pot will not be enough \u2013 Edmonds alone is seeking \u00a373m \u2013 amid signs that Lloyds is facing an uphill battle in resolving all the issues surrounding the fraud that took place over a decade ago at HBOS\u2019s Reading office. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, is investigating the \u201cextent and nature of the knowledge of these matters within HBOS\u201d. Lloyds has also appointed a retired high court judge to look at whether it investigated the problems in Reading promptly at the time of the takeover and whether it then reported its findings to the authorities. Anthony Stansfeld, police and crime commissioner of Thames Valley police, which led the prosecution, believes the \u00a3100m set aside by Lloyds is \u201cnothing like the sum that will be required\u201d to compensate the small businesses which had contact with the corrupt financiers. He said he has seen an email showing HBOS knew about the fraud in 2008 when it was estimated \u00a3200m had been defrauded. Even before the \u00a3100m compensation provision, Lloyds had lost \u00a3250m on loans caught up in the fraud which took place period between 2003 and 2007 when HBOS employee Lynden Scourfield, who was in charge of looking after troubled businesses, referred struggling companies to David Mills and his consultancy QCS in return for luxury cruises and lavish gifts. Mills and his associates, meanwhile, loaded big fees on the businesses and sometimes took control of them. Scourfield had pleaded guilty while the jury convicted Mills and his wife Alison, along with their associates Michael Bancroft and Tony Cartwright. Mark Dobson, a former HBOS banker, was also convicted. Edmonds has set up a countdown clock, a radio station and created a spoof TV ad online as part of his campaign for compensation. The TV entertainer was not a client of HBOS Reading nor did he become a client of the troubled business division. He is included in the review through his connections with Dobson. Edmonds claims that Dobson effectively became a shadow director of one his businesses, Unique, which was loaned money by HBOS. The former Noel\u2019s House Party host claims HBOS prevented him from selling shares in another business, UBC which would have helped repay the loan. Jonathan Coad, the lawyer at Keystone Law representing Edmonds, sets out three basic characteristics of a decent compensation scheme, which he says are not present in the Lloyds scheme. They are: the payment of professional fees built up by the claimants; ensuring that customer information provided by Lloyds to the independent reviewer is transparent; and using a \u201ccards on the table\u201d approach to negotiations that allows customers to see the information Lloyds holds about them. Coad is not alone in being concerned. Alison Loveday, chief executive at law firm Berg, which specialises in bank litigation, warns that victims may have to go through the courts. \u201cEven with the compensation scheme in place, customers are still reliant on the assessment of their claim by the bank and its independent reviewer. There is no confidence that this will result in fair and proper compensation being paid to the victims,\u201d she said. Lloyds insists it is paying legal and accountancy fees and that the review is not a sham because Griggs\u2019 role is \u201cto agree the individual case outcomes, and to ensure that these outcomes are fair\u201d. \u201cHe will make his decisions independently,\u201d Lloyds said. Some \u00a3300,000 is thought to have been paid out to help customers with their day-to-day living costs. Griggs has hired accountancy firms RSM and Mercer &amp; Hole to assist him and insists he is not rubber stamping compensation sums put to him by Lloyds. \u201cWe are thoroughly reviewing each individual case,\u201d his spokesperson said. \u201cProf Griggs has written to all customers asking them to come forward with information. After this information is submitted to Lloyds, Prof Griggs is then available for meetings and phone calls to discuss the entirety of their information directly with the customer,\u201d the spokesperson added. MPs are keeping a close watch. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP who intends to run as chairman of the Treasury select committee, said the bank should have been ready to compensate customers as soon as the case was over. \u201cFurther delay is unfair,\u201d he said. Rees-Mogg believes the customers\u2019 losses should be made good \u201cout of common justice and decency\u201d. John Mann, a Labour MP who sat on the Treasury select committee in the previous parliament, said Lloyds should get on with it. \u201cCompensation is not a give away. It is for loss suffered. It\u2019s rather symptomatic of the problem that this hasn\u2019t been done,\u201d said Mann. In the view of one business which was a victim of the fraud, the process is unnecessary. Nikki Turner, who with her husband Paul runs music publisher Zenith which was a customer of Scourfield, is refusing to take part in the Griggs review. She said: \u201cThere is no need for a review in the majority of cases because the situation is very clear cut ... The worst thing the bank can do is make the victims go through the whole experience again.\u201d She added that she received a letter in March from the Lloyds chairman Lord Blackwell, telling her he hoped the compensation process would restore trust in the bank. For some of the victims, at least, that goal has yet is to be achieved.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our financial editor Nils Pratley on the Italian banking deal, and its worrying implications for the long-term health of the Eurozone banking sector.... One cannot get around the fact that the spirit of the relevant EU banking directive has been ignored. The rules apply, except when they don\u2019t, it seems. That has two important consequences. First, as Capital Economics argues, the \u201cdoom loop\u201d between Italian banks and the Italian government remains a worry. If taxpayers can be on the hook at two regional banks, they may also be exposed if and when the banks more important and the sums significantly greater. Second, as the thinktank also points out, the cause of banking and fiscal integration in the eurozone has just suffered a serious jolt. In the next round of collective risk-sharing, eurozone states are supposed to guarantee deposits in each others\u2019 banks. It is now hard to imagine Germany rushing to join such a scheme. So forget the market\u2019s initial cheery response to this Italian bank job: a short-term problem has been fixed only by raising major long-term uncertainties. That does not sound like progress. And that\u2019s probably all for today; thanks for reading and commenting... GW After a strong start to the day, the stock market rally is fizzling out in late trading. The FTSE 100 is now up only 0.3%, or 25 points, having gained nearly 60 points this morning. Chris Beauchamp of IG says the weak American manufacturing orders figures released a couple of hours ago dented the mood in the City. An afternoon wobble has dented what had been a very positive day for stock markets. Another apparently order bank rescue for the eurozone, this time in Italy, plus a robust German IFO reading, had put markets on the front foot in the early part of the session. Even the UK government appeared to get its act together, with a deal between the Conservatives and the DUP putting the Tories across the threshold for a majority. But once again the summer malaise appears to be getting the better of equity markets, with gains being surrendered as London heads towards the close, with a disappointing US durable goods figure not helping matters. Unsurprisingly, financial names are in high demand in London following the Italian banking news, which is helping to keep the FTSE 100 in positive territory. But it is clear that for now investors are none too keen on pushing global markets higher. It could be a long summer. Silvia Merler, fellow at Bruegel, has published a really good analysis of last night\u2019s Italian bank deal. Here\u2019s her conclusion: Overall, this episode confirms a pattern in the management of Italian banking sector problems over the past years. Authorities try to kick the can down the road and often let political considerations outweigh economic issues. We have seen this in the delay of MPS\u2019 recapitalisation until after the constitutional referendum, in the creation of Atlas [Italy\u2019s bank bailout fund], and in the never-ending effort to shield retail junior bondholders to whom the sale of those product should have instead been better prevented. And we see it again here, in the use of generous liquidation aid. Some in Italy will see this last turn as a happy ending. Others will see it for what it actually is: a political choice. In Brussels, this episode will perhaps finally demonstrate that harmonising bank insolvency law is an indispensable complement to BRRD, as argued strongly by others before. As long as this is not done, the door remains open for the use of national insolvency frameworks to escape from resolution. The latest US economic data is out....and it\u2019s weaker than expected. Orders for durable goods shrank by 1.1% in May. That\u2019s nearly twice as large a drop as expected, and suggests US companies were more cautious about buying new machinery and electrical equipment last month. It\u2019s the second monthly fall in a row, and the biggest drop in six months. This has knocked the US dollar, and also driven down the yield (or interest rate) on US government debt. That shows that Wall Street is dialling back its expectations for US interest rate rises. Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics says the data shows businesses cut back on capital investment this quarter: May\u2019s durable goods data suggest that, after rising at a 7.2% annualised pace in the first quarter, business equipment investment has expanded at a much more modest pace in the second, which would fit with the slightly weaker tone of some of the surveys. Nonetheless, with consumer spending growth on course for a big acceleration, overall GDP growth is still likely to have rebounded quite strongly. Back in Greece, efforts to resolve the row between striking municipal rubbish workers and the government have collapsed. Unionists are now vowing to continue their walkout until Thursday amid warnings of a public health crisis as temperatures surpass edge towards 40 degrees Celsius, and rubbish continued to pile up. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: After abruptly ending talks with interior minister Panos Skourletis, the head of the municipal worker\u2019s union, Nikos Trakas, demanded that prime minister Alexis Tsipras intervene. Skourletis, he said, had thrown out the union\u2019s counter-proposal \u2013 following the government\u2019s olive branch offer of extending short-term contracts and permanent job status to around 2,500 workers \u2013 after five minutes. \u201cWe will continue the fight and on Thursday we will demand to see the prime minister of the country because the interior minister is incompetent,\u201d he said. Meanwhile Thessaloniki\u2019s mayor, Yannis Boutaris, has announced that he will outsource rubbish collection to private contractors as piles of garbage gather almost a week after the strike began. Temperatures are set to hit 43 degrees Celsius on Wedsnesday. Gold has hit a five week low this morning, as investors move money into riskier assets like shares. The price of an ounce of gold bullion fell 1.2% at $1,240, its lowest level since 17 May. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, attributes the moves to relief over the Italian banking deal, and the Conservative-DUP pact signed this morning. The one notable piece of news over the weekend came from Italy where an agreement was reached that will avoid winding down two Italian banks, the good assets of which will be transferred to Intesa Sanpaolo. The resolution seems to have appeased both the European Commission and the Italian government, both of which have been at loggerheads as to how to deal with the failing banks, as well as investors with financials across the board being boosted by the announcement. Reports this morning of an agreement between the Conservatives and Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP have seen the pound pop higher, albeit only marginally given that the deal has been widely anticipated and doesn\u2019t offer the kind of stability that a majority or even full coalition would. The deal will see Northern Ireland receive an extra \u00a31 billion over the next two years in exchange for the DUPs support for May\u2019s minority government. With the deal now agreed, the next question is whether May will remain in charge throughout that period. The improved sentiment in the market is weighing on safe haven assets, particularly Gold which is down more than 1% on the day. Gold recovered back towards $1,260 towards the end of last week but has been sold heavily this morning, hitting its lowest level since the middle of May at one point. A sustained break below $1,240 could trigger a move back towards $1,220, which has been a very notable level on numerous occasions this year. As this chart shows, gold took a tumble early this morning, sparking chatter in the City that a traders could have made a fat-finger error.... The pound has nudged a one-week high, after UK prime minister Theresa May finally secured an agreement with Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP party. Sterling gained almost half a cent at one stage to $1.2759, the highest since 19 June, as the City welcomed a rare piece of political certainty. The deal isn\u2019t cheap, though; the DUP have secured an extra \u00a31bn in spending on Northern Ireland over the next two years, in return for promising to support the Conservatives in confidence and budget votes. This has already caused a stir, with critics wondering which \u2018magic money tree\u2019 is providing the cash and other UK regions suggesting they should get more funds too. Over in Milan, branches of Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza have opened as usual today. And there are no signs of panic. That will please Italy\u2019s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, who pledged last night that it would be business as normal, following the sale of these \u2018good\u2019 assets to Intesa SaoPaolo. Let\u2019s get back to Italy...where the Bank of Italy has revealed that the rescue of the world\u2019s oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, is complete. Here\u2019s the Reuters\u2019 newsflash: Six months ago, the Italian government decided to bail out Monti dei Paschi, after efforts to raise capital from private investors failed (as with the Veneto banks). Since then, officials have been negotiating with EU authorities over how to handle the rescue. A draft plan was drawn up earlier this month, that will see some bond-holders \u201cbailed in\u201d, taking a financial hit. Rome is also expected to inject state funds into MPS, by tapping into a \u20ac20bn fund created last year (which is also being used to finance last night\u2019s deal for Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza) One last line from the TUC conference on insecure work, from Ioana Cerasella Chis of the University of Birmingham: Miatta Fahnbulleh, research director at the IPPR, argues that Britain\u2019s economy would be more productive if workers benefitted from better protections. Rather than simply worrying about job creation, Fahnbulleh says organisations should consult with staff to redesign and improve the workplace. Stefan Baskerville of the New Economics Foundation is also at the TUC conference. He argues that the increased digitalisation of the labour market is creating more insecurity for workers, and giving employers more power to control workers, including through algorithms that assess performance. Here\u2019s a thought....would company bosses care more about pay and conditions if their tax rate depended on it? The Citizens Advice service share the TUC\u2019s concerns over the high cost of taking an employer to an unfair dismissals tribunal: Ouch! Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union has slapped down Matthew Taylor\u2019s argument that workers enjoy the flexibility of today\u2019s labour market. Hunt points out that the boom in self-employment and zero-hours contracts is a recipe for exploitation. Despite his comments about protecting \u2018flexible\u2019 work, Matthew Taylor does concede that many workers in the Gig economy are unable to save for their pensions or pay for sickness insurance. Next up at the TUC conference is Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the Royal Society, who is conducting a government review into modern employment practices. After a tweet warning his audience not to expect too much (!), Taylor reveals that his inquiry should be published in a couple of weeks: However...Taylor then argues that many workers appreciate the \u201cflexibility\u201d in today\u2019s labour market; and that the priority has to be to get people into work. Back in London, the TUC\u2019s conference on Britain\u2019s insecure jobs market is underway. The session begins with a warning about the growth in contracts that don\u2019t provide any fixed hours work: TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady is now warning that this boom in insecure work is actually hurting the UK economy: We now have confirmation that the Italian bank rescue deal is jolly good news for investors who own debt issued by the two Veneto-based lenders. The value of bonds issued by both banks has soared this morning, after it became clear that bondholders would be spared losses (much to the anger of German MEP Markus Ferber). The FT has the details: Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza senior bond prices rocketed up more than 15 points on Monday, after the Italian government shielded the notes from losses in its wind-down of the two lenders. The senior bonds had been trading at steep discounts to face value, reflecting investors\u2019 fears that they could be \u201cbailed-in\u201d \u2013 a process whereby losses are imposed on private creditors to lessen the cost to the taxpayer. But over the weekend the EU commission signed off a scheme that will see Intesa Sanpaolo take on the good assets of the two Venetian banks, while also fully protecting senior bondholders. Vicenza\u2019s \u20ac750m 2020 senior note was trading at around 85 cents on the euro on Friday, according to Tradeweb prices, but soared up to 102 cents on Monday morning. Veneto\u2019s \u20ac500m 2019 senior bond surged from 88 cents to 103 cents over the same period. I\u2019m sure that Italian taxpayers are absolutely delighted for these bondholders... The Italian bank rescue/wind-up has helped to spark a relief rally across Europe\u2019s stock markets. Shares are up in London, Milan, Madrid, Paris and Frankfurt, as investors welcome the news that two of Italy\u2019s fragile lenders have been dealt with. The Italian FTSE MIB index is the top performer, up almost 1.5% this morning. Inteso Sanpaolo is still up almost 4%, with other banks also gaining ground. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, explains: European equity markets are higher on the day as two Italian banks were rescued over the weekend. The deal will result in Vento Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza being wound down, and the good assets of both banks will be sold to Italy\u2019s largest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, and the Italian government will should the burden of both banks bad assets. The bailout could cost the Italian tax payer up to \u20ac17 billion. There are still questions still hanging over the Italian banking sector, but for now investors are content with the Continent\u2019s financial health. The jump in German business confidence, to a record high, has also cheered investors. Joshua Mahony of IG says the IFO report has bolstered confidence in the eurozone economy. The German economy appears to be in rude health, if today\u2019s record Ifo business climate figure is anything to go by. According to Ifo, German businesses are \u2018jubilant\u2019, and it is clear that investors feel the same way, with the record high reading sparking a sharp move higher for the DAX, while gold immediately shed 1.4%. This is just the latest in a long line of encouraging economic indicators, with the eurozone seemingly emerging from years of decline at the very moment that the UK decided to leave the EU. Newsflash: Morale among Germany\u2019s business leaders has hit a record high. The German business confidence index, produced by the IFO economic institute, has jumped to 115.1 this month, beating expectations. IFO found that German businesses are optimistic about the economic situation, and hoping to export even more to the rest of the world despite the uncertainty around Brexit. Breaking away from Italy, municipal refuge workers in Greece have upped the ante in their ongoing clash with the Athens govenment that has left the streets covered in uncollected trash. The workers are extending their strike action, and continuing to demand that they shold receive permanent jobs when their existing short-term contracts expire. Helena Smith reports from Athens: An air of early summer crisis has symbolically imbued the ever-greater mounds of rubbish piling up around Greece. In a bid to break the impasse the interior minister Panos Skourletis announced, after a crisis meeting late Friday, that the leftist-led government would rush an amendment through parliament today effectively prolonging short-term contracts on the brink of expiry and opening the way for permanent jobs later this year. But....the olive branch, which would have seen around 2,500 workers given permanent status, was roundly rejected by unionists who are expected to make their own proposal later today. It is far from certain how international creditors will react to prime minister Alexis Tsipras openly defying labour reforms recently legislated in exchange for bailout funds to avert default. Many fear that with temperatures in their mid 30\u2019s, and Greece heading towards a heat wave, the standoff could create a public health crisis if the rubbish piles aren\u2019t cleared imminently. Short of being resolved the municipal workers have vowed to continue striking until Thursday. Last night, Bloomberg reporter Ferdinando Giugliano rattled out some interesting points about the Italian bank deal: German conservative MEP Markus Ferber (EPP) is extremely unhappy that Italian taxpayers are paying the cost of winding down the two Veneto lenders. In a strongly worded statement, Ferber argues that the central principle of European banking regulation \u2013 that bondholders shoulder losses if a bank fails \u2013 has been undermined. He says: \u201cWith this decision, the European Commission accompanies the Banking Union to its deathbed. The promise that the tax payer will not stand in to rescue failing banks anymore is broken for good. I am very disappointed that the commission has approved this course of action. By doing so the Commission has massively undermined the credibility of the Banking Union. If the common set of rules governing banking resolution is so blatantly ignored, there is no point in negotiating any further on a common deposit insurance scheme. The precondition for a working Banking Union is a common understanding of its rules. If such a basic common understanding is lacking, there is no point in further deepening the Banking Union and mutualising risk.\u201d Top German economist Isabel Schnabel is also unhappy that senior creditors are being spared any losses: This chart, from the EC\u2019s competition offices, shows how Italy managed to wind down Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza under its national laws, rather than EU rules. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets isn\u2019t impressed by this deal. He points out that Spain recently managed to engineer the rescue of its own failing bank, Banco Popular, without spending a penny of taxpayers\u2019 money. So much for the so called new single European rule book and the much vaunted European Banking Union. It appears that there is one rule for Spanish banks, and the recent rescue of Popular Bank, and another for Italian banks. Let\u2019s hope the Italian government has deep pockets given that this particular bailout is a fraction of the non-performing loans in the Italian banking system, of which it is estimated there are about \u20ac300bn. Shares in Intesa Sanpaolo have jumped by over 3% at the start of trading in Milan. Traders clearly think Intesa is getting a good deal, and no wonder. It\u2019s just picked up more customers, plus \u20ac5bn from the Italian state to ensure that its capital ratios aren\u2019t affected by the deal. Other financial shares are also rallying, sending the Italian banks index up by 2.5%. The bad news is that thousands of jobs are likely to be lost across Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, now they are part of larger rival Intesa. Reuters has the details: Intesa Sanpaolo said on Monday its planned acquisition of the good assets of Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca could lead to the closure of around 600 branches and the departure, on a voluntary basis, of around 3,900 staff. Italy began winding up the two failed regional banks on Sunday in a deal that could cost the state up to 17 billion euros ($19 billion) and will leave the lenders\u2019 good assets in the hands of Intesa, the nation\u2019s biggest retail bank. Rome spent the weekend drafting an emergency decree to liquidate the two banks, which collapsed after years of mismanagement and poor lending. The decree will have to be voted into law by parliament within 60 days. Overnight, the European Commission approved the \u20ac17bn Veneto bank rescue - even though it appears to breach the principle that taxpayers shouldn\u2019t rescue failing lenders. Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner, said: \u201cItaly considers that state aid is necessary to avoid an economic disturbance in the Veneto region.\u201d Many Italian bank bonds are owned by small retail investors. The Italian government has concluded that it it better to use state funds for this bailout, rather than inflict losses on ordinary families in the Veneto region. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit says Rome has performed some impressive \u201clegal gymnastics\u201d to get the deal through: But could the deal undermine the whole principle of European banking union, and the idea that bondholders stump up when things go wrong? The Financial Times says the deal could be a special case.... The drawn-out handling of the Veneto crisis has wider implications for Europe\u2019s banking union, which aims to integrate oversight of eurozone lenders partly based on the assumption that private creditors would cover bank failure costs, rather than taxpayers. The Italian state intervention to protect senior bondholders and big depositors runs counter to that principle but has been allowed because the banks\u2019 liquidation means there are no competition issues. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll be watching Italy, after the Rome government scrambled to wind down two regional lenders in an attempt to prevent a bank run. Last night, the Italian government agreed a deal in which the good assets of Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza will be acquired by Italy\u2019s biggest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo. Rome acted after the European Central Bank declared that the two banks were \u201cfailing or likely to fail\u201d, rattling confidence in the Italian banking sector. But the deal comes with a cost - Rome is handing Intesa \u20ac5bn to make the deal fly, and also providing \u20ac12bn of state guarantees to cover potential losses on the toxic assets and bad debts left behind. The size of the rescue package has stunned some analysts, especially as it doesn\u2019t obey the principle that bondholders, not taxpayers, are meant to take the hit when a bank fails. Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan defended the deal last night, telling reporters that: \u201cThose who criticise us should say what a better alternative would have been. I can\u2019t see it.\u201d The deal means that branches should open as usual this morning. And with Intesa now in control, the Italian government will be hoping to avoid a bank run today. Here\u2019s the story: Also coming up today: The TUC are holding a conference into insecure work in London today, in an attempt to improve the conditions and pay of some of Britain\u2019s most downtrodden workers. My colleague Katie Allen has interviewed TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady about this issue, and heard that the UK labour market must be improved. O\u2019Grady told us: \u201cThere are people across the spectrum who are pretty outraged at what\u2019s going on in 21st-century Britain. But nothing\u2019s happened. We had the prime minister on the steps of Downing Street, we\u2019ve had promise after promise, and we\u2019ve had no action. So I think patience is wearing thin and I think it\u2019s important that politicians do listen \u2013 but more importantly that they act. And there is no reason for delay. How much more evidence do people need?\u201d The TUC wants zero-hours contracts banned and for everyone on regular hours to have a right to a written contract guaranteeing their normal working hours. It wants an end to bogus self-employment and believes the law should change to give people a default right to qualify for all employment rights, unless the employer can demonstrate they are genuinely self-employed. Here\u2019s the full story: We\u2019ll also be watching out for a new survey of German business confidence this morning, and US manufacturing orders numbers after lunchtime.

As long as this is not done, the door remains open for the use of national insolvency frameworks to escape from resolution.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SMerler/status/879309186198274049\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My two cents on the story of Veneto Banca and Popolare di Vicenza. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Italy?src=hash\">#Italy</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/banchevenete?src=hash\">#banchevenete</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/AmMf6puF76\">https://t.co/AmMf6puF76</a>)</p>&mdash; Silvia Merler (@SMerler) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SMerler/status/879309186198274049\">June 26, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59510910e4b0cdea6d8653bd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-26T13:22:24.141Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US durable goods orders slide</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The latest US economic data is out....and it\u2019s weaker than expected.</strong></p> <p>Orders for durable goods shrank by 1.1% in May.

The resolution seems to have appeased both the European Commission and the Italian government, both of which have been at loggerheads as to how to deal with the failing banks, as well as investors with financials across the board being boosted by the announcement.</p> <p>Reports this morning of an agreement between the Conservatives and Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP have seen the pound pop higher, albeit only marginally given that the deal has been widely anticipated and doesn\u2019t offer the kind of stability that a majority or even full coalition would. The deal will see Northern Ireland receive an extra \u00a31 billion over the next two years in exchange for the DUPs support for May\u2019s minority government. With the deal now agreed, the next question is whether May will remain in charge throughout that period.</p> <p>The improved sentiment in the market is weighing on safe haven assets, particularly Gold which is down more than 1% on the day. Gold recovered back towards $1,260 towards the end of last week but has been sold heavily this morning, hitting its lowest level since the middle of May at one point. A sustained break below $1,240 could trigger a move back towards $1,220, which has been a very notable level on numerous occasions this year.</p> </blockquote> <p>As this chart shows, gold took a tumble early this morning, sparking chatter in the City that a traders could have made a fat-finger error....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"408a379a459b93695f8baf8982f86b36358166fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/408a379a459b93695f8baf8982f86b36358166fe/0_0_1060_355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The gold price today\" width=\"1000\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The gold price today</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5951009ae4b040bb3172c3f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-26T12:44:02.030Z\">1.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The pound has nudged a one-week high, after UK prime minister Theresa May finally secured an agreement with Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP party.</strong></p> <p>Sterling gained almost half a cent at one stage to $1.2759, the highest since 19 June, as the City welcomed a rare piece of political certainty.</p> <p>The deal isn\u2019t cheap, though; the DUP have secured an extra \u00a31bn in spending on Northern Ireland over the next two years, in return for promising to support the Conservatives in confidence and budget votes.</p> <p>This has already caused a stir, with critics wondering which \u2018magic money tree\u2019 is providing the cash and other UK regions suggesting they should get more funds too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jun/26/brexit-eu-nationals-theresa-may-to-meet-arlene-foster-in-hope-of-finalising-torydup-deal-politics-live\">\u00a31bn Tory-DUP deal will retain pensions lock and winter fuel payments - Politics live</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5950f719e4b0fd0bb54b5143\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-26T12:14:33.681Z\">1.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Over in Milan, branches of Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza have opened as usual today.</strong></p> <p>And there are no signs of panic.

That principle was introduced in the EU after the 2008 global financial crisis to quell the justified outrage that taxpayers, in effect, had been underwriting private sector banks\u2019 bad bets.

Second, as the thinktank also points out, the cause of banking and fiscal integration in the eurozone has just suffered a serious jolt. In the next round of collective risk-sharing, eurozone states are supposed to guarantee deposits in each others\u2019 banks. It is now hard to imagine Germany rushing to join such a scheme.

    "webTitle": "Smart meter rollout could force household bills to rise, says supplier", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Energy suppliers face rising costs for putting smart meters in millions of homes, adding pressure on firms to raise household bills further next year. Fitting the meters, which automate readings and which the government has set a target of installing in every home and small business by the end of 2020, costs suppliers about \u00a3100 per household today. But that will jump by nearly a third to \u00a3130 in 2018 as companies spend more time and money trying to contact harder-to-reach customers, according to one of the big six suppliers. However, the entire cost is not expected to be passed on to consumers. When five of the big six did increase their tariffs in the first four months, several blamed smart meters. ScottishPower said smart meters accounted for \u00a310 of the \u00a386 bill increase for millions of its customers. A source at one energy supplier, who did not want to be named, said the higher cost related to smart meters was due to \u201ccustomer apathy, concerns and the difficulty in getting people to agree to have a meter fitted\u201d. Staff were having to contact more people, more times, to achieve successful installs, they said. Householders typically need to take a day off to be at home over a four-hour period for an engineer to swap in a smart gas and electricity meter. A ramp-up of the smart meter rollout is planned next year, to close the gap between the 7m fitted so far and the 53m needed within four years. Smart meters were not included in the calculations made by the regulator Ofgem when it warned in January that the rising costs facing suppliers did not justify price hikes. When five of the big six did increase their tariffs in the first four months, several blamed smart meters. ScottishPower singled them out for \u00a310 of the \u00a386 bill increase for millions of its customers. Some of the companies were annoyed the cost of the meters had been excluded from Ofgem\u2019s index, which they believe was as a result of political pressure from the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Ofgem denied the claim. British Gas, which has fitted half of all the 7m smart meters, was the only one of the big six to hold prices in winter, freezing them until 1 August. However, the UK\u2019s biggest energy company is understood to have faced rising costs and is expected to increase tariffs soon. On Monday, government officials denied there had been any rowing back on the target to fit a smart gas and electricity meter in every home and small business by the end of 2020. The Conservative manifesto promised only to \u201coffer\u201d one to everyone, a downgrading of language from 2015 manifesto pledge for suppliers to ensure everyone had one by the end of 2020. That led to speculation that the target \u2013 backed by financial penalties for suppliers if they miss it \u2013 was being softened. But Oliver Sinclair, head of engagement for the government\u2019s smart meter programme, told the Guardian: \u201cThere\u2019s been a bit of misinformation in the media \u2026 Nothing has changed.\u201d The written shift was because the 2015 manifesto \u201ccould imply you had no choice to have a smart meter\u201d, he said. But he said the regulatory obligation on suppliers still stood: \u201cIt remains 2020. It remains to try and ensure there is a meter in every home.\u201d The official said the meters would help consumers save money on their bills by making them more aware of consumption, although they could unlock more futuristic possibilities too. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting to see smart fridges that can be turned off remotely during periods where the system needs balancing [energy supply and demand]; smart washing machines or dishwashers; electric vehicles that provide storage,\u201d he said. EDF, which was criticised in April for raising prices a second time \u2013 just days before ministers were expected to announce a price cap, called smart meters \u201cvery important [for] rebuilding trust with energy suppliers\u201d. But Jim Butler, who heads the group\u2019s smart meter programme, said there was a \u201ctremendous amount left to do\u201d on the rollout and the company had installed around 250,000 so far. British Gas denied it had been targeting easiest customers, such as early adopters, to keep costs down. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re picking the low-hanging fruit. The installs are being done for customers who are eligible,\u201d said Steve Briggs, who runs the supplier\u2019s programme. More than 1 million smart meters were installed in the first three months of 2017, a record rate and 10% higher than the previous quarter. Figures due out on Thursday will show whether the industry has kept up the pace. A spokesperson at the department for business, energy and industrial strategy said: \u201cOfgem is an independent regulator and BEIS cannot influence what is included in its Supplier Cost Index. Energy suppliers do have to make upfront investments to purchase and fit smart meters but once installed they will then help reduce energy bills. Smart meters will take \u00a3300 million off bills in 2020 alone.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 June 2017. An earlier version implied smart meters would be made compulsory by the end of 2020. The government has set a target of installing a smart meter in every home and small business, however they will not be compulsory.",

However, the UK\u2019s biggest energy company is understood to have faced rising costs and is expected to increase tariffs soon. </p> <p>On Monday, government officials denied there had been any rowing back on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/smart-meters-how-they-work\">the target</a> to fit a smart gas and electricity meter in every home and small business by the end of 2020.</p> <p>The Conservative manifesto promised only to \u201coffer\u201d one to everyone, a downgrading of language from 2015 manifesto pledge for suppliers to ensure everyone had one by the end of 2020. </p> <p>That <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/no-ones-noticed-tories-quietly-killing-smart-meter-revolution/\">led to speculation</a> that the target \u2013 backed by financial penalties for suppliers if they miss it \u2013 was being softened.</p> <p>But Oliver Sinclair, head of engagement for the government\u2019s smart meter programme, told the Guardian: \u201cThere\u2019s been a bit of misinformation in the media \u2026 Nothing has changed.\u201d</p> <p>The written shift was because the 2015 manifesto \u201ccould imply you had no choice to have a smart meter\u201d, he said. But he said the regulatory obligation on suppliers still stood: \u201cIt remains 2020. It remains to try and ensure there is a meter in every home.\u201d</p> <p>The official said the meters would help consumers save money on their bills by making them more aware of consumption, although they could unlock more futuristic possibilities too.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re expecting to see smart fridges that can be turned off remotely during periods where the system needs balancing [energy supply and demand]; smart washing machines or dishwashers; electric vehicles that provide storage,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>EDF, which was criticised in April <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/12/edf-customers-price-rise-electricity-gas-energy\">for raising prices a second time</a> \u2013 just days before ministers were expected to announce a price cap, called smart meters \u201cvery important [for] rebuilding trust with energy suppliers\u201d.</p> <p>But Jim Butler, who heads the group\u2019s smart meter programme, said there was a \u201ctremendous amount left to do\u201d on the rollout and the company had installed around 250,000 so far. </p> <p>British Gas denied it had been targeting easiest customers, such as early adopters, to keep costs down. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re picking the low-hanging fruit. The installs are being done for customers who are eligible,\u201d said Steve Briggs, who runs the supplier\u2019s programme.</p> <p>More than 1 million smart meters <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/615057/2017_Q1_Smart_Meters_Report_final.pdf\">were installed in the first three months of 2017</a>, a record rate and 10% higher than the previous quarter. Figures due out on Thursday will show whether the industry has kept up the pace.</p> <p>A spokesperson at the department for business, energy and industrial strategy said: \u201cOfgem is an independent regulator and BEIS cannot influence what is included in its Supplier Cost Index. Energy suppliers do have to make upfront investments to purchase and fit smart meters but once installed they will then help reduce energy bills. Smart meters will take \u00a3300 million off bills in 2020 alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 June 2017. An earlier version implied smart meters would be made compulsory by the end of 2020. The government has set a target of installing a smart meter in every home and small business, however they will not be compulsory.<br></p>",
