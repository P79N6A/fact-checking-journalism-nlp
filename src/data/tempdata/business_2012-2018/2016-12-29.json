      "bodyText": "A pensions expert has raised questions about the fate of the Dunlop Slazenger pension fund as Sports Direct prepares to sell the Dunlop sports brand to its Japanese distributor, Sumitomo Rubber Industries. Accounts for Dunlop Slazenger International, a subsidiary of Sports Direct, indicate the company had a \u00a39.2m pension deficit in April 2015, with sales of \u00a330.6m for the 12 months to 26 April and a loss of more than \u00a320m. Sports Direct has said it is only selling the Dunlop brand \u2013 best known for its green flash tennis shoes. It will retain Slazenger, the supplier of Wimbledon\u2019s tennis balls. Pensions expert John Ralfe, who recently advised a parliamentary committee inquiry into the handling of the BHS pension fund, said: \u201cWill the new owners be guaranteeing the pension obligations of the company they are buying?\u201d He added that new legislation should be brought in to ensure that such guarantees were given in future. Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions select committee, said the Pensions Regulator should be closely examining the Dunlop deal and publicly flagging up any issues. \u201cWhat can be gained by the regulator\u2019s secrecy?\u201d he said. Sports Direct should \u201cgive reassurance that it is not going to dump the deficit on the pension protection fund and the regulator should be active and reviewing this\u201d, he said. The regulator declined to comment on a specific case and said seeking clearance was a voluntary matter. MPs have called for the pension regulator to be given powers to veto takeover deals which put too much strain on pension schemes, among a raft of measures they believe could help avoid a rerun of the situation at retailer BHS, which collapsed in April and prompted recriminations about its \u00a3571m pension deficit. It is unclear whether the pension deficit has changed since the accounts for the year to April 2015 were filed. Sports Direct declined to comment, citing confidentiality and stock market rules. In a statement to the stock market earlier this week, Sports Direct said the Dunlop business made a pretax profit of \u00a34m on sales of \u00a341.8m this year, figures which it said were unaudited. Accounts filed for the Dunlop Slazenger group in 2015 at Companies House show a \u00a322.3m loss. The group was technically insolvent, with more liabilities than assets but the accounts state that Dunlop Slazenger remained a going concern as working capital was financed by Sports Direct. Sports Direct\u2019s founder and major shareholder, Mike Ashley, acquired Dunlop Slazenger for an estimated \u00a340m in 2004 from Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 which had taken control of the struggling business from its private equity-backed owners. The company is selling Dunlop to a Japanese buyer in a surprise $137.5m (\u00a3112m) deal. Sumitomo Rubber Industries, which already owns the Dunlop rights in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, confirmed that it will acquire the remaining international rights to the brand, as well as its sporting goods and licensing businesses. The deal is scheduled to be completed in May 2017. As part of the deal it has granted Sports Direct a royalty free licence to continue to usethe Dunlop brand for premium workwear and safety wear sold in its own stores. Last year, Dunlop Slazenger\u2019s sales were about half the \u00a358m recorded in the year before Ashley took over the group. In 2003 it made a \u00a35.5m loss while its pension deficit stood at \u00a313.3m. Sumitomo did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 may have been toasting a new closing peak, but elsewhere in Europe shares were drifting lower, with banking stocks proving a drag on markets. The final scores in Europe showed: Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.21% to 11,451.05 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.2% lower at 4838.47 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.18% to 19,203.94 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.19% at 9327.1 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.15% to 636.67 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is drifting away from the 20,000 level and is currently down 18 points at 19,815. Meanwhile, after initially shrugging off an unexpected rise in US crude inventories, oil prices have edged marginally lower, with Brent now down 0.37% at $56.01 a barrel. As for the FTSE 100, it has hit a record high for the second day running, so here is our story giving the background to Wednesday\u2019s new peak: On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for the last trading day of the year. It looked a bit unlikely as the FTSE 100 drifted lower for much of the day, but the leading index managed a last minute dash to a new closing high. The index ended 14.18 points higher at 7120.26, within sight of the all time record reached on 11 October this year. With gold and silver prices moving higher, precious metal miners such as Randgold Resources and Fresnillo helped push the index into record territory. Meanwhile the more UK-focused FTSE 250 added just 2.61 points to 18,015.42 and is some distance away from its own peak of 18,607 achieved in early October. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped lower - down around 7 points - while the FTSE 100 has shied away from a new closing high and is now 4 points lower. On the Dow, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: After yesterday\u2019s decisive turn lower for US markets there has been little sign of fresh bullish momentum. Barring a miracle, Dow 20,000 looks off the cards, although the rebound in the index over the past year, as in other US markets, has been astounding. Only time will tell if the Trump euphoria can be sustained, or whether we are due another correction early on in the New Year. Oil prices are little changed following the release of the latest US data, with Brent crude up 0.5% at $56.50 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate more or less flat at $54.03. US crude stocks showed a surprise rise last week, according to official figures. Inventories rose by 614,000 barrels to 486m compared to forecasts of a 2.1m barrel decrease, according to the Energy Information Administration. But gasoline stocks fell by 1.6m barrels rather than the expected 1.3m barrel increase. Despite the Dow\u2019s reluctance to surge towards 20,000, the FTSE 100 has just edged into positive territory. Could we yet have a new closing high? US markets are mainly edging ahead in early trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average regaining a little ground after Wednesday\u2019s triple digit decline and moved another step closer to the so far elusive 20,000 barrier. The Dow is currently up 36 points at 19869 while the S&amp;P 500 opened marginally higher and the Nasdaq composite marginally lower. Oil is holding steady ahead of the latest US inventory figures from the Department of Energy. On Wednesday the American Petroleum Institute reported a surprise 4.2m barrel increase in weekly US crude stocks compared to an expected fall of 2.1m barrels. But ahead of the official DoE figures, Brent crude is up 0.44% at $56.47 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 0.18% lower at $53.96. Here\u2019s Reuters on the US data: A drop in U.S. exports last month pushed the country\u2019s trade deficit in goods higher while the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week in a positive sign for the labor market. The two reports released on Thursday suggested that when Donald Trump becomes president next month, the labor market will likely be at roughly full strength and international trade could be weighing on the economy. In an initial estimate that does not include trade in services, the Commerce Department said America exported $1.2 billion less in November than in October. Imports rose by $2.2 billion during the month. The full trade report for November is due on Jan. 6... Separately, initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 265,000 for the week ended Dec. 24, the Labor Department said. It was the 95th straight week that claims were below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller. The department said in a statement there were no special factors affecting claims last week although estimating the data can be more difficult around holiday periods. The department said the actual number of claims was estimated by government staff for 10 states. More on the US trade gap, from Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief US economist: Gracious me, we have TWO little pieces of economic news. Firstly, America\u2019s trade deficit has swelled by 5.5%. New figures from the Commerce Department show that the US trade gap widened to $65.3bn in November, up from $61.9bn in October. Exports shrank by $1.2bn to $121.7bn, while America imported $187bn of stuff, $2.2bn more than in October. Secondly, the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims has fallen by 10,000, to 265,000. That\u2019s broadly in line with forecasts, and shows that the US labour market remains resilient. That will reassure the US Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates earlier this month. As it\u2019s quiet, what better time to catch up with the biggest business stories of 2016? We\u2019ve crunched the numbers, and found that the Brexit vote, and the US election\u2019s impact on the markets, were the most popular issues this year. Our daily liveblog did well again too - so thanks to all readers for keeping our numbers up :) Fiona Walsh, business editor of Theguardian.com, explains: Six of our 10 most-read articles covered the aftermath of the shock EU referendum result, from the trillions wiped off global markets to the plummeting pound and the prospect of negative interest rates. There was Donald Trump too, of course, and an apocalyptic warning from economists in January to \u201csell everything\u201d before a new crash. Here\u2019s the full 10 Ten: I fear America\u2019s stock market won\u2019t bring much excitement today either. The futures market is suggesting Wall Street will open little changed, in 90 minutes time, after the S&amp;P 500 fell by almost 0.9% yesterday (its biggest drop since the US election). Italy\u2019s prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, has now criticised the European Central Bank for demanding that Monte Dei Paschi raise more new capital than previously planned. Gentiloni told reporters that he got the news on Christmas Day - which may have rather spoiled the turkey and sprouts. And Gentiloni wants to see the ECB\u2019s workings out, echoing finance minister Padoan\u2019s concerns. Reuters has the story: The European Central Bank should discuss with Italy the reasons behind its assessment that Banca Monte dei Paschi had a greater need for capital than previously thought, Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said on Thursday. \u201cIt is important that the motives for this assessment are shared in discussions in the coming months,\u201d Gentiloni told a news conference. He added he had been surprised on December 25 to receive news that the regulator wanted Monte Paschi to plug a capital shortfall of \u20ac8.8bn, higher than a previous estimate of \u20ac5bn. Pier Carlo Padoan\u2019s criticism of the ECB comes as Italian banking shares post fresh losses today. UBI Banca, Unicredit and Banca Popolare di Milano are all among the biggest fallers on the Stoxx Europe 600 banks index (which tracks Europe\u2019s financial stocks). Investors are edgy that the cost of recapitalising the Italian banking sector may be going up, after the ECB demand that Monte Dei Paschi raises more capital than expected. Over in Italy, finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan has lashed out at the European Central Bank over its handling of the world\u2019s oldest bank, Monte Dei Paschi (MPS). Earlier this week, the ECB told MPS that it needs to raise almost \u20ac9bn in new capital, sharply higher than the \u20ac5bn which it had tried, and failed, to attract from private investors. Rome\u2019s government is now stepping in to rescue MPC, and Padoan sounds rather unimpressed that the bill had gone up. Speaking to financial newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, Padoan said the ECB\u2019s new demands would leave MPS \u201chyper-capitalised\u201d. He also criticised the Frankfurt-based central bank for not explaining its thinking more clearly: \u201cIt would have been useful to receive additional information from the ECB Supervisory Board on the criteria used for such a valuation, since it has consequences for the other banks. \u201cIn addition to a letter of five lines and three numbers, some explanation would have been useful; opaque moves without an explanation lead people to think that there\u2019s something wrong behind it.\u201d MPS\u2019s liquidity position has been worsening in recent months, with some savers taking money out of the lender. More here: It\u2019s disappointingly quiet out there.... There may still be time for another Santa Rally! After a festively slow start, the FTSE 100 has roused itself after its 8am selloff, and crept back to 7106 points - last night\u2019s record closing level. Trading is still pretty quiet, with many City workers still enjoying a Christmas break. Many mining stocks are still in the red today, following commodity prices down. And banks across Europe are under pressure, partly due to worries over Italy\u2019s banking bailout. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at London Capital Group, says the markets are being cautious after commodity prices retreated in Asia overnight, meaning: A combination of profit-taking and risk-off is weighing on the UK\u2019s 100 largest caps in London. She also suggests the US stock market could fall, if the latest trade and unemployment figures, due at 1.30pm, miss expectations. The US\u2019s November trade balance and the weekly jobless claims are due out today. Any disappointment could cause a further disillusion regarding the US recovery and encourage a deeper correction in the US markets, given that there is room for significant pullback following the relentless, two-month rally in the US stock markets following Donald Trump\u2019s appointment as the US\u2019 next president. Is London\u2019s house price boom fizzling out? Prices in the capital only rose by an annual rate of 3.7% in in the last quarter, compared to a UK average of 4.5%, according to new figures from the Nationwide building society. This is the first time since 2008 that London prices have lagged the national average (although obviously houses are still much pricier than elsewhere). Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, expects prices to rise by 2% in 2017, although there is \u201ca greater degree of uncertainty than usual\u201d. \u201cThe story of UK house price growth in 2016 was one of relative stability. Annual house price growth ended 2016 at 4.5%, the same as the rate recorded in 2015. There were signs that London\u2019s significant period of outperformance may be drawing to a close.\u201d Nationwide also reports that a typical first-time buyer in London would have to be in the top 90th percentile of earners (ie, one of the best paid 10% of the population), while in the North typical buyers are in the top 30th. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, says this is a serious concern: \u2018London clearly has suffered more in the price stakes than elsewhere in the country, a reverse of what we were seeing earlier in the year and for most of 2015. But for us it is the steep fall in number of transactions and market accessibility, which remains a challenge particularly for first-time buyers, rather than the ups and downs of prices which is more important. More here: It\u2019s been another torrid day for Toshiba. Shares in the Japanese manufacturer tumbled by 19% in Asian trading, following losses of 20% on Wednesday and 12% on Thursday. Today\u2019s slump was driven by continued fears that the company faces a massive charge relating to the purchase of a nuclear construction business called Stone &amp; Webster a year ago. Toshiba shocked investors earlier this week by admitting that it may have to write off several billion US dollar\u2019s worth of \u2018goodwill\u2019, having bought Stone &amp; Webster for $229m. Analysts are concerned that the full cost is still unknown; last night, Moody\u2019s slashed Toshiba\u2019s credit rating and warned that the company\u2019s operating and financial performance could deteriorate. More here: Money is flowing out of shares and into bonds this morning. That\u2019s a sign that investors might be taking a safety-first approach ahead of the New Year break. So bond prices are up, pushing yields (interest rates) down to their lowest levels in several weeks: Precious metals producers Randgold and Fresnillo are leading the risers in London, both up over 2%. But other mining firms are dropping back, with Rio Tinto and Glencore both down over 1%. Mining stocks had driven yesterday\u2019s rally, but are now suffering from falling commodity prices today (steel and copper prices have both dipped). The pound has bounced back from yesterday\u2019s two-months low, rising 0.25% to $1.225. That\u2019s helping to pull the FTSE 100 down (as a weak pound is good for internationally focused firms) Having closed at a record high last night, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is subsiding at the start of trading. The blue-chip index dropped by 35 points, or 0.5%, in early deals to 7074 points. Other European markets have also dipped, as the selloff on Wall Street last night casts a shadow. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: US markets stumbled yesterday as investor optimism cooled and hopes faded of the Dow Jones hitting 20,000 before year-end. However volumes remain light and this doesn\u2019t mean the 2016 election fuelled rally is done with. It may just be taking a well needed breather. The biggest fallers in London are BT and Dixons Carphone, which has gone \u2018ex-dividend\u2019 this morning (you had to own the shares last night to receive the next payment to investors) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It could be another red letter day in the City. The FTSE 100 closed at a record high last night, and traders are now wondering if the index could smash through its all-time intraday high today. The omens aren\u2019t great, though, with spreadbetters predicting small falls this morning as investors book profits before the year end. The FTSE 100 is expected to drop by 27 points at the open, having closed at 7106 last night. The alltime high is 7129 points. Later today, America\u2019s Dow Jones industrial average could have another tilt at the fabled 20,000 point mark. Yesterday it fell by 111 points - only its second triple-digit decline since last month\u2019s presidential election, suggesting the rally may be fading. On the economic front, the City will be digesting new house price figures from Nationwide, which show prices jumped by 0.8% in December (more on that shortly). At 1.30pm, we get the latest US trade figures, and the weekly unemployment numbers. And we\u2019ll keep an eye on Italy, for any developments in its banking bailout. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

      "bodyText": "Retailers will struggle in 2017 as rising food price inflation leaves shoppers with less to spend on discretionary items such as clothing and homeware, according to a leading industry thinktank. Prices could rise by between 2.5% and 3% next year, led by an expected 2.4% rise in the price of food and groceries, the highest level since 2013, according to the Retail Thinktank, a group backed by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and analysts at advisory firms KPMG, Verdict, Nielsen and Ipsos Retail Performance. Maureen Hinton at Verdict said: \u201cThe higher price of imported goods following the EU referendum, and the fall in the UK pound, has been masked by currency hedging in 2016, but this starts to unravel in Q2 2017 and all retailers, struggling with cost inflation and squeezed margins, will be forced into passing on price rises to the consumer.\u201d Shoppers have so far been unaffected by the Brexit vote, with sales growing 1.3% in the month to 26 November, but according to the latest data from the BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor, the thinktank said the triggering of article 50 in March, which will kickstart the formal process of the UK leaving the EU, was likely to increase uncertainty. James Knightley of ING said: \u201cDespite the current period of relative calm ahead of article 50 being triggered, businesses are wary. Surveys from the Bank of England and others are pointing to a sharp slowdown in both hiring and investment spending over the next 12 months. \u201cThis is largely due to the perceptions that uncertainty will increase once the Brexit countdown clock begins. An intensification of UK-EU hostilities could result in more businesses sitting on their hands \u2026 and this may feed through into weaker consumer confidence.\u201d Retailers\u2019 performance over Christmas will not become clear until next week when many major groups, including Next and John Lewis, are expected to reveal their trading figures. Early figures indicate a tough time for physical stores while online retailers have enjoyed record sales. The number of people visiting UK shops was down by 7.3% on Boxing Day, one of the most important dates in the retail calendar, according to the monitoring firm Springboard. That followed a disappointing Christmas Eve when, instead of the expected last-minute rush of gift buyers, footfall dropped 5.9% on the year. Boxing Day online sales rose by 6.2% compared with the record-breaking 2015, according to figures from the e-commerce data company PCA Predict. Springboard, which uses electronic sensors to count shopper numbers, predicts that footfall for the last week in December will be down 2.3% on the same period last year as a growing tendency to spend on nights out adds to the shift to online shopping. Fashion retailers, however, are expected to have enjoyed a better season as more normal chilly weather returned after two unusually warm autumns and winters. A surge in tourist spending prompted by the fall in the pound is also likely to have helped luxury shops and stores, especially in London. James Knightley, senior UK economist at ING, said: \u201cThe strength of the economy following the Brexit referendum has surprised many, but we must remember that article 50 is still to be triggered. Scheduled to happen before the end of March, it will coincide with Dutch elections and possibly Italian elections, while the French presidential election campaigning will be in full swing.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Brexit, Trump and 25 spoons of sugar: our top business stories of 2016", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The fallout from the Brexit vote dominated our business coverage in 2016, led by Graeme Wearden and his daily live blog. Six of our 10 most-read articles covered the aftermath of the shock referendum result, from the trillions wiped off global markets to the plummeting pound and the prospect of negative interest rates. There was Donald Trump too, of course, and an apocalyptic warning from economists in January to \u201csell everything\u201d before a new crash. Based on the number of page views, here are our 10 most popular business stories in 2016. 1. US election reaction: stocks rally but warnings of trouble ahead With more than 2m page views, our live blog of the aftermath of Trump\u2019s election victory was the most-read business article of the year. Our teams in New York, London and Sydney tracked the initial panic as it swept through world markets, followed by an extraordinary rally. Shares in private prison groups and gun makers did particularly well on Wall Street. There were warnings of trouble ahead, but traders appeared to pay no heed. 2. Brexit panic wipes $2tn off world markets Friday 24 June brought shock, horror and sheer panic to trading floors around the world. Wearden and Nick Fletcher covered it all in an 18-hour live blog of the turmoil that greeted Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. It was an extraordinary day\u2019s trading. More than $2tn was slashed from the value of global markets and sterling suffered its biggest selloff in recent history. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, stepped up with a promise to take any measures necessary, but economists said the Brexit vote had left Britain on the brink of a recession that would reverberate around the world. 3. Sell everything ahead of stock market crash, say RBS economists In January economists at RBS issued an apocalyptic warning that stock markets could crash by 20% and oil prices slump to $16 a barrel. \u201cSell everything except high quality bonds,\u201d they said. China could be the crisis point, they argued. Their numbers were wrong but they were right when they said it would be a \u201ccataclysmic\u201d year. Just as well they didn\u2019t know then about Brexit and Donald Trump. 4. UK credit rating downgraded after Brexit vote In the turbulent aftermath of the EU referendum result, as the pound hit 31-year lows and shares tumbled again, Britain was stripped of its last AAA credit rating. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s downgraded the nation\u2019s creditworthiness to AA, with a negative outlook. The agency said Brexit would hit growth and had weakened the predictability, stability and effectiveness of policymaking in the UK. 5. Richest 62 people as wealthy as half of world\u2019s population Oxfam\u2019s annual analysis of how global wealth is (not) shared always makes grim reading. Its analysis in 2016 was timed to coincide with the gathering of many of the world\u2019s superrich at Davos, and the figures laid bare the vast gap between rich and poor. The charity called for urgent action to tackle the growing inequality that saw the wealth of the poorest half of the world\u2019s population drop by 41% between 2010 and 2015, while the wealth of the planet\u2019s richest 62 people jumped by $500bn to $1.76tn. 6. Pound hits $1.30 as property funds are frozen The fallout from the Brexit vote continued to reverberate through the markets, as City property funds barred investors from withdrawing their cash and the Bank of England said risks to the financial system had begun to crystallise. The then chancellor, George Osborne, held a summit with the heads of the major high street banks, who pledged to avoid a new credit crisis by making loans available. 7. Pound and shares rally after two days of record Brexit losses Shares in London and around the world rebounded in volatile trading after three traumatic days that wiped an unprecedented $3tn off global markets. As he called for a second referendum to be held, the Virgin boss, Sir Richard Branson, said \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of jobs would be lost in Britain as a result of Brexit. 8. Lagarde urges speedy Brexit deal as pound hits new lows The IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, called for clarity on Britain\u2019s Brexit plan \u201csooner rather than later\u201d. That was two weeks after the referendum. Six months on, we\u2019re still waiting. The leading economist Mohamed El-Erian, meanwhile, piled on the pain for the battered pound, saying it could slump to parity with the dollar. 9. Cafes serving drinks with 25 teaspoons of sugar a cup One sugar \u2026 or 25? A shocking report from the campaign group Action on Sugar found that 98% of the 131 hot flavoured drinks found in the big high street chains would carry a red warning if they were forced to label them. Some hot chocolate and other trendy chai drinks contained staggering amounts of sugar, up to 25 teaspoons, in one serving. 10. NatWest paves way for introduction of negative interest rates Nat West bank raised the spectre of negative interest rates, telling its business customers it might have to charge to accept deposits. The bank, which is part of the Royal Bank of Scotland and so owned by the taxpayer, issued its warning in a letter changing the terms and conditions for its 850,000 business customers, which range from self-employed traders to clubs, charities and large corporations.",

      "bodyText": "Britain faces a decade of disruption after Brexit with low growth, stagnating incomes for the poor and the public finances at breaking point, according to a bleak analysis by a leading thinktank. The report, Britain in the 2020s, by the Institute of Public Policy Research, says Brexit will \u201cprofoundly reshape the UK \u2026 painful trade-offs are almost certain. Growth is expected to be lower, investment rates worse, and the public finances weaker as a result of Brexit.\u201d The analysis, which draws on data from the OECD, the ONS and numerous economists and researchers, forecasts a 30% increase in the number of over-65s in the population by 2030, and a doubling of the number of over-85s. It predicts that the proportion of the population that is non-white will climb to more than one in five within 12 years. The world of work will be revolutionised with millions of jobs in retail and manufacturing disappearing as a result of automation and the internet, the report says. Income inequality will become more entrenched, as will the wealth gap between London and the rest of the country. By 2030 households will on average be \u00a31,700 worse off per year than they would have been if Britain had stayed in the EU, with a persistently falling currency driving up prices and hitting the living standards of poorer people the hardest, according to the report. Low-income households are predicted to see their earnings rise by just 2% between now and 2030, leaving them little better off than a generation before. Meanwhile, the average FTSE 100 chief executive\u2019s pay is forecast to soar to \u00a39.5m by 2030 \u2013 350 times the median income, up from a multiple of 144 today. The report\u2019s author, Mathew Lawrence, said the IPPR had taken a neutral position during the run-up to the EU referendum, and the report simply highlighted how Brexit would exacerbate challenges around inequality and low productivity that the UK was already facing. New barriers to trade after Britain leaves the EU are likely to drive the currency down and to increase costs, the report says. Government finances may buckle under the strain of NHS and pension spending as Britain ages and Brexit reduces the tax base. The 65-plus population will rise to 15.4 million by 2030, from 11.6 million today, while the working-age population will rise by just 3%. The IPPR predicts a \u00a313bn shortfall in the funding of adult social care alone by 2030 as the government struggles to finance care for elderly people in their homes. Pressure on schools, hospitals and infrastructure will also increase as Britain\u2019s population continues to grow rapidly despite a short-term post-Brexit reduction in EU migration. The report forecasts that the UK will have the fastest growing population of any major country in Europe, overtaking France\u2019s population by 2030 and Germany\u2019s in the late 2040s. The IPPR also predicts a more diverse country, with the non-white proportion rising from 14% in 2011 to 21% by 2030 and to more than a third of the population by 2050. Vast numbers of workers in the UK face losing their jobs as automation progresses, with the economy soon hitting \u201cpeak human\u201d before robots and artificial intelligence take over, the IPPR argues. It forecasts that 2m jobs in retail will disappear by 2030 and 600,000 will go in manufacturing. Britain in the 2020s will continue to see a hollowing out of middle-income jobs, with large numbers of well-paid jobs in a few industries \u2013 largely in London and the south-east \u2013 offset by a growing precariat of poorly paid, often self-employed workers. \u201cThere will be more self-employed workers in the 2020s than public sector employees,\u201d the report says. It says the rest of the world also faces a slowdown in economic growth, partly as population growth slows and partly because of climate change. It also forecasts crises for China. By 2030 the country will have 17 of the top 50 cities in the world ranked by GDP, but its rapidly ageing population, credit bubbles and political uncertainty will undermine its rise and ensure the US remains the dominant global power. Keir Starmer MP, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: \u201cThis report shows once again the clear dangers of a hard Brexit and the importance of ensuring we get the best possible Brexit deal that protects jobs, the economy and living standards. \u201cIt also reminds us that there are wider and profound challenges facing the Britain in the years and decades to come - both to our economy, society and our place in the world. Labour has an obligation to future generations to find progressive and effective responses, and to help bring Britain back together after a deeply divisive referendum.\u201d Gerard Lyons, a leading pro-Brexit economist and former adviser to Boris Johnson, dismissed much of the IPPR\u2019s findings as \u201csecond-hand questionable figures\u201d and \u201cmeaningless jargon\u201d. He said: \u201cFar from being a constraint, Brexit provides the UK with a great opportunity to adopt both a domestic and a global policy agenda to address many of the challenges highlighted by the IPPR in this report.\u201d David Campbell Bannerman, a Tory MEP and member of the Leave Means Leave group which this week asked business groups across Europe to put pressure on their governments to negotiate a free trade agreement with Britain, also criticised the report. \u201cNo surprises here from such a favourite Blairite thinktank which receives EU funding. This is misery wrapped in humbug,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes no account of the benefit of UK negotiating free trade deals around the world, of billions saved in deregulation of EU over-regulation, nor of more jobs, better treatment and greater training of the UK workforce once immigration is controlled and the \u00a312bn net savings from EU contributions reinvested.\u201d Looking ahead: what the IPPR foresees 2% \u2013 forecast total income growth for poor households between now and 2030. \u00a39.5m \u2013 predicted pay of FTSE 100 CEOs by 2030. \u00a3341bn \u2013 difference between taxes raised and expected spending by 2050. 76 million \u2013 population of the UK when it overtakes Germany and becomes Europe\u2019s biggest country in the late 2040s. 21% \u2013 non-white proportion of the population by 2030. 15.4 million \u2013 number of over-65s in 2030, compared with 11.6 million today. 80% \u2013 increase in the number of adults over 65 with dementia by 2030. 10% \u2013 decline in China\u2019s working population by 2030, by which time Africa will have more working-age people than China. 1tn \u2013 number of sensors connected to the internet by 2025. 2m \u2013 number of jobs lost in retail by 2030. 600,000 \u2013 number of jobs lost in manufacturing by 2030. 15m \u2013 number of current jobs that will be automated in the coming decades. 3m \u2013 number of new jobs that will be created by 2030, largely in healthcare and business services.",
