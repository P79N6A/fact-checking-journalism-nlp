      "bodyText": "Vodafone has warned that it could move its head office from the UK if negotiations for a post-Brexit Britain do not result in freedom of movement for people, capital and goods. The telecoms company, which employs nearly 110,000 people around the world and about 13,000 in the UK, said it would take \u201cwhatever decisions are appropriate\u201d once the outcome of the talks is known. In a statement, the company pointed out that its European businesses produce 55% of the group\u2019s annual profit, the UK 11%. Britain\u2019s membership of the EU had been an important factor in Vodafone\u2019s growth, it said. \u201cFreedom of movement of people, capital and goods are integral to the operation of any pan-European business, as are single legal frameworks spanning all member states. \u201cAccess to the emerging European digital single market should represent a significant opportunity for the UK, one of the world\u2019s leading digital economies,\u201d the company said. \u201cIt remains unclear at this point how many of those positive attributes will remain in place once the process of the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union has been completed. It is therefore not yet possible to draw any firm conclusions regarding the long-term location for the headquarters of the group.\u201d Vodafone, which is led by the Italian Vittorio Colao, said that while the outcome of the Brexit negotiations remained uncertain, the company intended to beef up its \u201cregulatory and public policy activities in Brussels to ensure [that] the group\u2019s substantial businesses within the European Union continue to be represented appropriately\u201d. It is understood that if any move were made, it would affect the group\u2019s offices in Paddington, central London, rather than Vodafone\u2019s UK hub in Newbury, Berkshire. Vodafone is now the seventh-biggest company on the FTSE 100, with a stock market value of more than \u00a355bn. Its warning came as the CBI business lobby group said companies are putting investment plans on ice as a result of the EU referendum result uncertainty. As a wide range of businesses, including German company Siemens and Virgin, warned of the implications for the UK, the CBI director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, called on the UK government to act quickly. Speaking after a summit of 27 business and industry representatives hosted by the business minister, Sajid Javid, she said: \u201cWe\u2019re a long way off having a plan and leadership and \u2026 that is what businesses need. \u201cWe urgently need leadership, particularly given the political vacuum.\u201d She also demanded reassurance for EU workers in the UK. \u201cWe must give urgent long-term reassurance to the thousands of EU migrants already working in the UK that they can stay here,\u201d Fairbairn said. Javid hinted that UK negotiators may seek a deal with Brussels under which the UK would have access to the single market without agreeing to freedom of movement for EU citizens who want to work in Britain. Maintaining access to the single market, allowing UK businesses trading with the EU to avoid punitive tariffs, would be a \u201cnumber one priority\u201d, said Javid, adding that \u201caccess can come in many forms\u201d. Non-EU countries such as Norway and Iceland have access to the single market, but only on the condition that they allow freedom of movement for EU workers. Despite EU leaders warning that Britain cannot expect special treatment, Javid said a deal permitting Britain to opt out of freedom of movement was not out of the question. \u201cYou refer to how other countries have secured access but I don\u2019t think \u2026 it has to work like that for the UK,\u201d he said. Javid claimed that some major overseas investors were unconcerned by the political uncertainty. He pointed to the Chinese telecoms company Huawei, which has promised the government that its planned \u00a31.3bn investment in the UK will go ahead. Guo Guangchang, the chairman of Fosun Group, China\u2019s biggest private conglomerate, told Reuters that he was still on the lookout for deals in the UK. But other business were more cautious. Siemens, which makes wind turbines in Hull, admitted that it was putting wind power investment plans on hold. Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of advertising company WPP, told a conference organised by the Times: \u201cThis is going to be very painful, but the turmoil does bring opportunities.\u201d The most outspoken critic was Branson, who warned that Chinese investors were already pulling back from the UK. \u201cThe last two days has been absolute pandemonium worldwide in the markets, the pound crashing, the stock markets crashing, and we are heading rapidly towards a recession again. It\u2019s just too sad; so, so sad,\u201d said Branson, who lives in the British Virgin Islands and did not have a referendum vote in the UK, but owns businesses spanning financial services and gyms that employ 50,000 people in the UK. Banks, whose shares have been badly affected by the market rout, also responded to the turmoil. The chief executives of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group wrote to their employeesto spell out risks and offer reassurance about the future. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, told its 90,000 employees: \u201cOur \u2018day one\u2019 plan worked, but of course the result of the vote carries with it a range of unknowns about the short, medium and long-term prospects for the UK and its economy. Added to this we now have a period of political uncertainty.\u201d His counterpart at Lloyds, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, said the bank\u2019s strategy to be a UK-focused, low-risk retail and commercial bank remained unchanged. \u201cI know that the referendum result has had an impact on the share price of many companies, including ours, but I believe the fundamentals of the group are strong,\u201d he said. To reinforce his view he bought 100,000 Lloyds\u2019 shares for \u00a354,000. It was reported that Visa was also considering cutting hundreds of UK jobs as there was a fresh focus on how US banks operating in Britain would react. The co-head of European operations at Goldman Sachs, Richard Gnodde, appeared to signal that jobs would move after telling the Times CEO summit that \u201cevery outcome is possible\u201d. Other US banks, notably JP Morgan, have warned about job losses and the Fitch ratings agency suggested US banks could relocate jobs to Ireland and the Netherlands. Robin Johnson, the head of the cross-border mergers and acquisitions team at Eversheds law firm, said Brexit would accelerate decisions to move jobs. \u201cAlready we\u2019re hearing noises about possible offshoring and even permanent relocation\u201d. Legal &amp; General was among companies trying to settle nerves. The financial services company said it had planned for a 50-50 probability of a vote for the UK to leave the EU, and had removed risks from its portfolios. Engine maker Rolls-Royce, which wrote to staff in the run-up to the referendum to say it wanted to remain in the EU, said it was committed to the UK, where the company employs 23,000 people.",

      "bodyText": "Sir John Kingman has never chaired a public company, let alone been an important member of the FTSE 100 index, but suddenly his arrival at Legal &amp; General looks inspired, or at least less of a gamble. Kingman was second permanent secretary at the Treasury and thus one of the country\u2019s most senior civil servants. He should be a useful big brain for L&amp;G\u2019s board to call upon to explain the finer points of the commercial carve-up that will be UK\u2019s renegotiation of its trading relationship with the European Union. L&amp;G didn\u2019t have Brexit in mind, one assumes, when approaching Kingman. But the group says it had assumed a 50% probability of a vote to leave, which is why Tuesday\u2019s post-referendum update on the capital position carried the tone of an extended boast. L&amp;G took a few \u201cde-risking\u201d actions in advance. Thus the whack from the upsets in financial markets was \u00a3200m or so, which is not much in the context of an insurer with a regulatory capital surplus of \u00a34.9bn. As for rating agencies\u2019 downgrade of UK sovereign debt, L&amp;G was on the job: it had shifted already for the purposes of internal modelling. Very reassuring. It was enough to add 8% to L&amp;G\u2019s share price in yesterday\u2019s wider stock market rally. Even so, the 178p share price compares to 236p on the eve of the referendum because investors\u2019 (understandable) response to Brexit has been to worry about everything financial. Caution will dominate for ages, one suspects, but L&amp;G looks more robust, better provisioned and more diversified than most in its sector. And, on the lower share price, the historic dividend yield is now an eye-catching 7.6%. \u201cThis has to be close to a screaming buy unless you are in the financial Armageddon camp,\u201d says Berenberg\u2019s analyst. You\u2019ll get no share tips here, but that\u2019s a popular view if you believe the Brexit crisis will pass eventually. Kingman has timed his move well. Chairing L&amp;G looks more fun than being on the telephone to Brussels and Berlin for the next two years, which is the fate of his former colleagues. Myners close to the mark on Green\u2019s pension responsibilities Lord Myners is perhaps not a wholly impartial observer \u2013 he has history with Sir Philip Green from Marks &amp; Spencer days \u2013 but his assessment that the Topshop tycoon will need to find \u00a3400m-plus to resolve the pension mess at BHS sounds close to the mark. The sum has not been plucked out of thin air. The important principle here is that the Pension Protection Fund, which is funded by a levy on defined benefit schemes, should not be left out of pocket when Green fulfils his promise to \u201csort\u201d the deficit in the BHS fund. It would be \u201cunconscionable for any shortfall to be dumped on solvent schemes through the levy,\u201d Myners told Sky News. Quite right, and one can see the outline of a three-part deal. Members of the BHS scheme with small sums invested could be offered a lump sum. The body of the scheme would be transferred to the PPF, with Green making up the shortfall. And the BHS executives, whose pensions would suffer a haircut under PPF rules, would be topped up via a new scheme, again with funding from Green. It sounds a workable structure, with the latter two elements costing about \u00a3200m apiece. The MPs, when they cross-examined Green, should have pressed him harder on his definition of \u201csorting\u201d the deficit. But Myners\u2019 version is on the right lines: no dumping on the PPF, and fully-funded transfers from the off. Shawbrooks shoots itself in the foot The UK\u2019s challenger banks will find life more challenging in the new world, runs the reasonable thesis. Bad debts could rise if the economy slows; lower-for-longer interest rates will hurt margins; and regulators\u2019 capital demands could become tougher. Against that backdrop, it\u2019s best not to shoot yourself in the foot. Shawbrook\u2019s warning of a \u00a39m charge stemming from \u201cirregularities\u201d in its asset finance division was horribly timed. The lender to small and medium-sized businesses said \u201ca number of loans\u201d did not meet the group\u2019s \u201cstrict\u201d lending criteria. The cock-up was discovered when a new risk-management system was installed. At a push, it\u2019s encouraging that the new control system is better tuned than the old one. Even so, a \u00a39m charge on a \u00a314.7m collection of loans is hefty \u2013 it\u2019s equivalent to about 13% of Shawbrook\u2019s pre-tax profits last year. The difference with challenger banks is that they have specialist knowledge about their customers and take a personalised approach to underwriting. That, at least, is what it says on Shawbrook\u2019s website. Bruised investors, contemplating a share price at half its pre-referendum level, may want to be persuaded anew. Os\u00f3rio leads by example with personal share purchase That\u2019s the spirit: Ant\u00f3nio Horta Os\u00f3rio, chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, followed his memo to staff (\u201cthe fundamentals of the group are strong\u201d) by buying 100,000 shares at 54.2p, the lowest they\u2019ve been since 2013. The outlay was not large for a man with an \u00a38.5m pay package last year, but it was something. Let\u2019s see if it is mirrored elsewhere by bosses working in sectors where share prices have suffered a shake-out. A personal share purchase sends a stronger message of confidence than an anodyne email.",

Chairing L&amp;G looks more fun than being on the telephone to Brussels and Berlin for the next two years, which is the fate of his former colleagues.</p> <h2>Myners close to the mark on Green\u2019s pension responsibilities</h2> <p>Lord Myners is perhaps not a wholly impartial observer \u2013 he has history with Sir Philip Green from Marks &amp; Spencer days \u2013 but his assessment that the Topshop tycoon will need to find \u00a3400m-plus to resolve the pension mess at BHS sounds close to the mark.</p> <p>The sum has not been plucked out of thin air. The important principle here is that the Pension Protection Fund, which is funded by a levy on defined benefit schemes, should not be left out of pocket when Green fulfils his promise to \u201csort\u201d the deficit in the BHS fund. It would be \u201cunconscionable for any shortfall to be dumped on solvent schemes through the levy,\u201d Myners told Sky News.</p> <p>Quite right, and one can see the outline of a three-part deal. Members of the BHS scheme with small sums invested could be offered a lump sum. The body of the scheme would be transferred to the PPF, with Green making up the shortfall. And the BHS executives, whose pensions would suffer a haircut under PPF rules, would be topped up via a new scheme, again with funding from Green. </p> <p>It sounds a workable structure, with the latter two elements costing about \u00a3200m apiece. The MPs, when they cross-examined Green, should have pressed him harder on his definition of \u201csorting\u201d the deficit. But Myners\u2019 version is on the right lines: no dumping on the PPF, and fully-funded transfers from the off. </p> <h2>Shawbrooks shoots itself in the foot </h2> <p>The UK\u2019s challenger banks will find life more challenging in the new world, runs the reasonable thesis. Bad debts could rise if the economy slows; lower-for-longer interest rates will hurt margins; and regulators\u2019 capital demands could become tougher.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, it\u2019s best not to shoot yourself in the foot. Shawbrook\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/28/shares-in-challenger-bank-shawbrook-plunge-on-loan-irregularities\">warning of a \u00a39m charge</a> stemming from \u201cirregularities\u201d in its asset finance division was horribly timed. The lender to small and medium-sized businesses said \u201ca number of loans\u201d did not meet the group\u2019s \u201cstrict\u201d lending criteria. The cock-up was discovered when a new risk-management system was installed.</p> <p>At a push, it\u2019s encouraging that the new control system is better tuned than the old one. Even so, a \u00a39m charge on a \u00a314.7m collection of loans is hefty \u2013 it\u2019s equivalent to about 13% of Shawbrook\u2019s pre-tax profits last year. The difference with challenger banks is that they have specialist knowledge about their customers and take a personalised approach to underwriting. That, at least, is what it says on Shawbrook\u2019s website. Bruised investors, contemplating a share price at half its pre-referendum level, may want to be persuaded anew.</p> <h2>Os\u00f3rio leads by example with personal share purchase</h2> <p>That\u2019s the spirit: Ant\u00f3nio Horta Os\u00f3rio, chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, followed his memo to staff (\u201cthe fundamentals of the group are strong\u201d) by buying 100,000 shares at 54.2p, the lowest they\u2019ve been since 2013.</p> <p>The outlay was not large for a man with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/25/lloyds-hands-chief-executive-85m-pay-package\">an \u00a38.5m pay package last year</a>, but it was something. Let\u2019s see if it is mirrored elsewhere by bosses working in sectors where share prices have suffered a shake-out. A personal share purchase sends a stronger message of confidence than an anodyne email.</p>",

My Local, which is expected to go into administration today, has shut nearly 90 stores over the past few days.

      "bodyText": "Living standards are expected to fall as a result of the vote to quit the EU and foreign companies will be deterred from investing in Britain, according to economists appearing before a parliamentary committee. They called on the chancellor to ditch plans for a tough budget of tax rises and spending cuts in favour of higher public investment to prevent the UK sinking into recession. David Miles, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, said there would be knock-on effects to government revenue and spending from a fall in economic growth and a possible recession. \u201cIt seems likely GDP growth will be slower and it will be important the government gives itself more flexibility in meeting spending rules and change the aim of trying to close the deficit over the next few years,\u201d the Imperial College economist told MPs on Tuesday. The comments follow a similar attack on George Osborne from former Bank of England governor Mervyn King, who said the chancellor\u2019s plan for a \u201cpunishment budget\u201d immediately after the Brexit vote, and now delayed until the autumn, left him baffled. Appearing before the Treasury select committee in a hastily convened meeting, Stephen King, chief economist at HSBC, said living standards would \u201ctake the strain\u201d as Britain struggled to cope with the aftershocks of the vote to leave the EU. King said higher petrol prices and more expensive imported food resulting from the low pound were unlikely to be offset by a boost to exports, while the uncertainty surrounding Brexit would reduce investment, leading to job losses and falling wages. A decline in foreign investment could hurt productivity, triggering the same fall in living standards the same situation seen after the 2008 financial crash. King\u2019s message was reinforced by Sir Richard Branson, who was among several business people to warn that foreign investors have begun to shelve or cancel planned projects in the UK. Lord Turnbull, a crossbench peer and former head of the civil service, said the government need to delay telling the EU commission of a decision to leave using article 50 before Whitehall was sure what ministers were asking for. He said it would be unwise to trigger the clause in the Lisbon treaty until next spring to allow officials to prepare their negotiating positions. Any later and they might find French and German officials being distracted by parliamentary and presidential elections, scheduled for the autumn of 2017. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is trigger article 50 and then for [the German chancellor] Angela Merkel to turn around and say she doesn\u2019t want to talk to us because she has bigger fish to fry,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work to get through. A new cabinet and frontbench will need to get into their jobs and then into the details of trading arrangements, what we are going to offer on the movement of people. We are not going to get all we want on one and not make a concession on the other.\u201d Turnbull said he supported basing the Brexit team in the Cabinet Office, but added: \u201cAt the moment it is under the charge of Oliver Letwin, who I think is completely unsuitable in the longer term. He has spent the last six years as a kind of consigliere of the prime minister. He has been absolutely at the heart of No10. And that is not the profile needed for carrying this work forward.\u201d He said it needed someone committed to the cause of Brexit. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 June 2016. An earlier version quoted Lord Turnbull as saying Oliver Letwin had been a \u201ckind of conciliary\u201d of the prime minister; that has been corrected to \u201cconsigliere\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The man who introduced Dominic Chappell to Sir Philip Green, thereby facilitating the controversial takeover of BHS for \u00a31, has said he \u201cnever thought in a million years\u201d that Chappell would end up running the department store chain. Paul Sutton, who has a spent conviction for fraud in France, revealed to MPs in a committee session on Tuesday that Chappell had initially been his driver when he was working on his own deal to buy BHS. Sutton was forced to stand down from his bid after a dossier describing a series of allegations against him \u2013 including the fraud conviction \u2013 was sent to Green. Chappell then took over Sutton\u2019s bid proposal, eventually buying BHS from Green\u2019s retail business Arcadia for \u00a31 in March 2015. Sutton said that standing down from his bid team \u201cwas the only decent thing to do\u201d and he agreed to sign a declaration that he would not be involved in a deal to buy BHS. Sutton claims the dossier was sent by the sisters of his partner and is part of an alleged blackmail attempt against him. \u201cI never thought in a million years he would run BHS,\u201d Sutton said of Chappell. Sutton, who was introduced to Green by banker Robin Saunders, said he was \u201csad\u201d not to have been involved with running BHS. \u201cI was completely unaware what Dominic et al were up to behind the scenes,\u201d he added. BHS collapsed into administration in April, putting 11,000 jobs at risk and leaving a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Green controlled BHS for 15 years until he sold it to a consortium led by Chappell, who has been declared bankrupt three times. There is growing anger about the collapse of BHS because Green and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rental payments and interest during the tycoon\u2019s period in charge. Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions also collected at least \u00a317m from BHS despite owning it for just 13 months. MPs on the work and pensions committee and business, innovation and skills committee are investigating how the BHS\u2019s pension scheme ended up heavily in deficit and why Green sold the company to Chappell. In the latest hearing, MPs also heard from Alex Dellal, a property tycoon who helped to finance Chappell\u2019s takeover of BHS, and Neville Kahn of Deloitte, a key adviser to Green. Dellal said that the collapse of BHS was a \u201cterrible tragedy\u201d but confirmed he had made \u00a36m from a property deal with the retailer while it was owned by Chappell and millions more from loaning money to Chappell\u2019s consortium. Kahn revealed that Green met the Pensions Regulator on Monday to discuss a rescue deal for the BHS pensions scheme dubbed \u201cProject Atlantic\u201d. However, Kahn refused to disclose details of the plan. Lord Myners, the former government minister, has said that Green needs to contribute more than \u00a3400m to resolve the problems facing the pension scheme. Myners, who is advising the parliamentary committee, made the claims to Sky News. New written evidence published by the MPs claims Green was put under pressure by the US backers of Topshop to sell BHS so he could focus on running the youth fashion chain. LEK, a consultancy firm, also claimed it was told the tycoon did not want to sell to a rival retailer because it would have \u201cpersonal reputational consequences\u201d if they succeeded in turning around the department store chain. In a submission to the parliamentary committee, LEK, which was advising Sutton on his bid for BHS, say Sutton told the firm about the pressure from the US backers and Green\u2019s concerns about selling to a rival. Leonard Green, a US investment firm, bought a 25% stake in Topshop in 2012, a deal that valued the fashion chain at \u00a32bn. Green continued to wholly control Arcadia, which ran BHS, Wallis and Dorothy Perkins, after the deal. LEK said: \u201cAccording to Mr Sutton, Sir Philip\u2019s American backers had supported him on the condition that he exit his other retail activities, to focus on driving international expansion of the core Topshop brands.\u201d It added: \u201cHe also said Sir Philip was unwilling to sell out to any of his retail rivals, as this would also have personal reputational consequences if a turnaround succeeded under their direction.\u201d However, Sutton denied the claims. Sutton said that Green was \u201cvery emotional\u201d about BHS and had pledged to fix the pension scheme as part of his deal to buy the retailer. Arcadia declined to comment. In a fiery six-hour hearing with MPs earlier this month, Green said he would \u201csort\u201d the pension problems facing BHS, but a plan is yet to emerge. \u201cNothing is more sad than how this has ended,\u201d the billionaire said. \u201cThere is certainly no intent at all on my part for anything to be like this, and it didn\u2019t need to be like this. I just want to apologise to all the BHS people who have been involved in this.\u201d The relationship between Green and one of Britain\u2019s most influential bankers is to be scrutinised on Wednesday. Michael Sherwood, the vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs, will appear before MPs to answer questions about his ties with Green. Goldman has been thrown into the centre of the BHS scandal after Green claimed he \u201cone million per cent\u201d would not have sold the department store chain to Chappell if the prospective buyer had not passed an informal vetting by the bank.",

      "bodyText": "The volatility suffered by stock markets in recent days is unlikely to ease in the near future. The day saw a rebound following the sharp declines which came in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, but the City is reluctant to bet too strongly on where markets go from here. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: It would be premature to call the bottom of the market, prices are still adjusting to the post-Brexit world, and it would be foolhardy to rule out further price swings. The bounce in the Footsie does show there are buyers out there who are swooping in when prices fall sufficiently, but markets neither go up, or down, in a straight line, and things may yet have to get worse before they get better. Valuations on the UK stock market look in the middle of their historical range, which suggests it\u2019s a reasonable time to put money in the market if you are a long term investor. But given the current volatility, you need to be willing to stomach further price falls, if you are dipping a toe in. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 2.64% or 158.19 points at 6140.39 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.93% to 9447.28 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.61% higher at 4088.85 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 3.3% to 15601.62 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 2.48% at 7835.0 In Greece, the Athens market added 3.72% to 538.65 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 148 points or 0.87%. As for the pound, it is now up 0.9% at $1.3342 after climbing as high as $1.3418. Against the euro it is 0.68% higher at \u20ac1.2075. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. ECB president Mario Draghi has said Brexit could reduce European GDP by up to 0.5 percentage points, according to a document seen by Bloomberg. Here\u2019s the full Reuters report on the meeting between business leaders and government minister Sajid Javid: Britain appears a long way from developing a clear plan on the country\u2019s future trading relationship with the European Union, the head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said on Tuesday after a meeting with government. CBI Director-General Carolyn Fairbairn said some firms were putting investment on hold after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU last week, and that they needed a clearer sense of what the government intended to do. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly early days. I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s coming out of these meetings feeling great, but they are coming out with a sense of resolve,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re a long way off having a plan and leadership and that is still where we will be continuing to make (the point) that this is what businesses need,\u201d she added. Fairbairn said businesses expressed very high levels of real and genuine concern to business minister Sajid Javid, who had called the meeting, and that the government also needed to address the fears of EU migrants employed in Britain. At the meeting between business leaders and the government, there were high levels of real concern following the Brexit vote according to the CBI. Reuters reports the CBI saying that the government needed to develop a plan on the country\u2019s trading relationship with the EU very quickly. Businesses also wanted the government to get on with major infrastructure projects which are already underway. There were also concerns about rising prices, housing, and the insecurity being felt by migrant workers in the UK. The CBI director general said a number of firms had put investment on hold, said Reuters, and said the meeting did not feel great but there was a sense of resolve. After two days of panic leading shares have regained a little of the lost ground. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Today has seen a welcome reprieve from the incessant fear and risk aversion that has dominated financial markets since Friday\u2019s unexpected referendum result. The question on everyone\u2019s lips is whether we have seen an end to the selling, with many seeing current prices as an opportunity to buy their favourite firms at a temporary discount. [But] this selloff is unlikely to be over and perhaps the only thing that will truly raise risk appetite for good will be a faint glimmer of hope that we could see a second referendum. Despite the binary nature of Friday\u2019s referendum result, far from providing a definitive answer to the markets, we now find ourselves in the eye of a political and economic storm. We have moved from a position of security and stability, to one where we do not even know who will lead the two main political parties in a year\u2019s time. David Cameron may have said that there is no way to go back on the referendum result, but Jeremy Hunt\u2019s suggestion that he would hold a second referendum reminds us that crucially the decision is no longer Cameron\u2019s to make. UK business secretary Sajid Javid says maintaining single market access will be his number one priority in negotiations with the EU. He says British access to the single market may not take the same form as other non-EU countries. He says the UK economy remains strong and over the past few days investors have reaffirmed their commitment to the UK. Javid also said that a package of support for a potential buyer of the Port Talbot steel works was still available. US banks with significant UK operations are likely to act sooner rather than later to shift their operations, according to ratings agency Fitch. It said: The UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union will be disruptive for US global banks with significant operations in the UK and will weigh on their profitability in the short to medium term, Fitch Ratings says. However, the impact is likely to be moderate as we believe they will be able to operate through other EU legal entities. US global banks are likely to start strategically implementing parts of their contingency plans rather than wait for trade and service arrangements to be agreed. Resolution planning for US global systemically important banks was constructive for their Brexit contingency planning because of the requirement to rationalize and understand their global legal entity structure and activities. Restructuring operations will depend on license status in various jurisdictions, as well as establishing operational scale, potentially reallocating capital and relocating where trades and clients are booked. Relocation of staff is likely to follow; for example, ahead of the referendum, JP Morgan had announced that as many as 4,000 of its UK roles could be shifted out of the country. Management will have to decide where to focus its European operations, depending on language requirements, staff expertise and incentives offered by these countries. Flexible labor laws will be important for US firms, so this may favor countries like Ireland and the Netherlands, rather than Germany and France. After cutting the UK\u2019s credit rating from AAA to AA, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has said it had no plans to downgrade any other EU country in the wake of the Brexit vote. But it said it would decide whether any UK bank ratings should be cut in the coming weeks. Reuters reports: \u201cThis does not lead to mechanical changes (in bank ratings),\u201d S&amp;P banking sector analyst Giles Edwards said on a webcast. \u201cBut equally this (Brexit scenario) was not our base case... where we see a need to change ratings we will do so in the coming weeks.\u201d On other EU sovereign ratings, S&amp;P\u2019s global sovereign chief Moritz Kraemer said: \u201cWe have no intention of downgrading any other EU sovereign.\u201d S&amp;P chopped the UK\u2019s credit rating by two notches to AA and kept it on a \u2018negative outlook\u2019 on Monday in the wake of last week\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. It was the first time it had ever made such a deep cut to a top-rated sovereign. Here\u2019s a link to video of Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras arriving earlier at the European Council, warning the Brexit vote was a wake up call for Europe: More Brexit fallout. Siemens is putting new wind power investment plans in the UK on hold due to uncertainty caused by last week\u2019s Brexit vote, the Germany energy company has told the Guardian. Arthur Neslen reports: A \u00a3310m manufacturing hub in Hull that employs 1,000 people will not be affected by the decision, and should still begin producing blades and assembling turbines next year. But Siemens, one of the few firms to openly back a Remain vote, will not be making new investments until the future of the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe becomes clearer. Juergen Maier, the firm\u2019s UK CEO, said that an existing blueprint to export offshore wind turbine machinery from the Hull hub was now up in the air. Sign up to our EU referendum morning briefing Read more He said: \u201cThose plans were only beginning to happen and I expect that they will stall until we can work out exactly what the [new government\u2019s] plan is, how we can participate in EU research programmes, and until all the issues around tariffs and trade have been sorted out.\u201d The full report is here: After higher than forecast US GDP figures, comes a better than expected consumer confidence number. According to the conference board, the consumer confidence index came in at 98 in June, compared to 92.4 in the previous month and an expected 93.3. (This was before the outcome of the UK referendum of course.) But there was a weaker manufacturing survey from the Richmond Federal Reserve: Earlier UK chancellor George Osborne suggested taxes would have to go up to address the economic damage caused by Brexit. So what taxes would they be? VAT could be one, according to tax specialists at Eversheds. The law firms partner Ben Jones said: If tax rises are required, ironically VAT (the only real European tax and a prerequisite for EU membership) could be the tax most likely to increase. VAT is a huge source of tax revenue and relatively easy to increase, both practically and politically. Indeed, during the financial crisis of 2008 and after, VAT was increased from 17.5% to 20% as part of measures to tackle the fiscal deficit. Increases to income taxes, national insurance contributions or business taxes would most likely be far more publically unpopular and politically undesirable. And here\u2019s the Greek prime minister on the lesson from Brexit as he arrives at the European Council: Back with the European parliament: In tandem with other global markets, which have recovered a small part of the hefty declines seen in the wake of last week\u2019s Brexit vote, the US has moved higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average - down almost 900 points since the referendum outcome - has gained 144 points or 0.8% as bargain hunters dip their toes into the market. The S&amp;P 500 has opened up 0.7% and Nasdaq 1.1%. Representatives of several industries are due to meet business minister Sajid Javid MP this afternoon for a summit on the potential impact of the Brexit vote on UK firms, writes Rob Davies. Food and Drink Federation director general Ian Wright will warn Javid that the industry faces a huge staffing shortfall if EU citizens are blocked from working in the UK. \u201cThe UK food industry has almost 100,000 workers from the rest of the EU. We have an emerging gap of up to a further 130,000 workers as our ageing staff retire over the next decade,\u201d he said in a prepared statement. \u201cWhile we as an industry continue to take many steps to develop home-grown talent through ambitious graduate and apprenticeship programmes, EU workers also provide a highly valued solution to our skills gap. \u201cThe UK food industry benefits from bringing in skilled labour from the EU and we urgently need assurances from UK Government that EU nationals working in the UK will be granted leave to remain. UK Government must now develop a new migration policy that ensures food and drink manufacturers have continued access to the workers we will need to address a looming skills gap and the drive for future innovation to support our UK competitive advantage.\u201d Here\u2019s a video of Richard Branson discussing his Brexit concerns on Good Morning Britain: Lloyds Banking Group is the latest to try and reassure on the consequences of Brexit, following rival Royal Bank of Scotland earlier. Lloyds chief executive Antonio Horta Osorio has written to staff telling them the bank had \u201crobust plans in place for either outcome\u201d, according to Reuters. He said its strategy would remain unchanged and its low risk lending approach and historic brands put it in a position of strength to \u201cweather turbulence in our sector and the wider market.\u201d The pound is accelerating higher. It\u2019s now gained almost two cents to $1.341, a jump of 1.5% today. Shares in London are also pushing higher, as the City recovers some poise following two days of Brexit panic. The FTSE 100 index is now up 175 points, or almost 3%, at 6157. That means it has clawed back ALL of Monday\u2019s losses. Investors are piling back into financial stocks, perhaps reassured that banks only took \u00a33bn in liquidity from the Bank of England this morning Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The main change from yesterday to today seems to be the performance of the banks. Accepting around \u00a33 billion in a Bank of England liquidity auction this morning, the UK\u2019s banking sector is looking a bit rosier after having the colour completely drain from its face at the start of the week. Barclay, Lloyds and RBS are the key stocks here; the trio suffered the most in the aftermath of Friday\u2019s Brexit announcement, diving up to 30% in the last 2 days of trading. Today, however, they have risen anywhere between 4% and 6%; a long way off from recapturing all of their losses, but a start nevertheless. But given the political turmoil in the UK, and the uncertainty over when (or indeed ever?) Britain will trigger Article 50, there may be more volatility ahead.... Newsflash from America: The US economy grew faster than expected in the first three months of this year, in some much-needed good news. US GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.1%, a little faster than expected, and means a quarterly rate of almost 0.3%, It\u2019s up from a previous forecast of just 0.8% annualised growth (or 0.2% quarter on quarter). Over in Brussels, European leaders are gathering for a summit dominated by Britain\u2019s Brexit bombshell. Prime minister David Cameron just arrived, telling reporters outside that he is seeking the \u201cclosest possible relationship\u201d between the UK and the EU. He also insists that the leaving process must be constructive; European countries are still our friends, our neighbours and our allies. Cameron was followed into the EU headquarters by Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, who had a scathing verdict on the UK: Our Politics liveblog will be tracking the action in Brussels: After two days of heavy falls, Wall Street is expected to rally today. Trading begins in 90 minutes. Ireland isn\u2019t the only European country which would suffer from Brexit. Fitch says that: The most exposed countries are Ireland, Malta, Belgium, the Netherlands, Cyprus and Luxembourg, all of whose exports of goods and services to the UK are at least 8% of GDP. And if Britain does well outside the EU, other member states could follow, Fitch adds... Brexit will create a precedent for a country leaving the EU and we believe it increases political risk in several ways. It could boost anti-EU or other populist political parties, and make EU leaders more reluctant to implement unpopular policies that would have long-term economic benefits. Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, says he hopes that the Republic can avoid being hurt by Brexit..... Rating agency Fitch has issued a warning that the Republic of Ireland could be downgraded because of the economic cost of Britain leaving the EU. It warns that Ireland is \u2018highly exposed\u2019 to the UK economy, given the strong trade links, so any Brexit slowdown could have a serious impact. However, the Irish credit rating is probably safe in the short term, at least. Here\u2019s the full statement: The UK vote to leave the European Union is negative for Ireland, raising risks to growth and creating uncertainty around future relations with Northern Ireland, Fitch Ratings says. It is unlikely to have any immediate implications for Ireland\u2019s sovereign rating in the near term, but a medium-term rating impact would be possible if the economic dislocation of Brexit were to prove severe. Ireland\u2019s economy is highly exposed to Brexit. According to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the UK accounted for 12.6% of Ireland\u2019s total goods exports in January-April 2016, and 24% of total goods imports. The UK also accounted for 20% of total services exports in 2014. Total goods and services exports to the UK are equivalent to around 17% of GDP. There could be significant sector-specific fall out. For example, the UK accounts for 49% of Irish agricultural exports. A UK slowdown, sterling depreciation and potential future trade barriers between Ireland and the UK would weigh on Irish exports, economic growth and employment; although the full impact will only become clear as EU-UK negotiations develop. We think the most important near-term impact will be through reduced domestic confidence. In the medium term, Ireland could gain from a shift of some foreign direct investment from the UK to the EU or from international businesses relocating from the UK, but this is highly uncertain. Fitch also warns that political tensions between the Republic and Northern Ireland could rise (on Saturday, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Martin McGuinness, deputy first minister for Northern Ireland, called for a poll on reunification) Brexit would represent a symbolic moving apart of the UK and Ireland that could weaken confidence in the peace process in Northern Ireland and potentially impair cross-border relations and trade. Ireland\u2019s minority government, which was formed in May after February\u2019s inconclusive election, has outlined its \u2018Contingency Framework\u2019 that will guide its policy response. This identifies priorities including UK-EU negotiations, UK-Irish relations, trade and investment, and Northern Ireland. It remains to be seen how effective this will be, and some domestic political uncertainty persists given the relatively loose agreement between Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. Lower economic growth would reduce the tax intake, reducing the medium-term fiscal space that the government identified in its recent Summer Economic Statement. Ireland\u2019s commitment to fiscal consolidation during and after its EU-IMF programme leads us to think an increase in fiscal risks would be met with a policy response to continue meeting fiscal targets and limiting the impact on public debt dynamics. Our upgrade of Ireland to \u2018A\u2019 from \u2018A-\u2019 in February reflected the marked fall in government debt to 93.8% of GDP in 2015 from 120% in 2013 driven by strong and broad-based growth and fiscal consolidation. While negative, Brexit is unlikely to undermine the progress that Ireland has made in these areas. Fitch expects debt/GDP to fall in the medium term, helped in part by lower nominal interest rates. The pound is clinging onto its early gains this morning, as stability returns to the City. Sterling is still up around 1.1 cents today, at $1.3334 against the US dollar. That\u2019s still close to yesterday\u2019s 31-year low, and a long way from the pre-referendum levels: Caxton FX analyst Nicholas Laser-Ebisch warns that sterling\u2019s problems aren\u2019t over: Today will see the very first EU summit where leaders of all of the EU\u2019s 28 member states will meet in Brussels for a first exchange about the British referendum and the consequences involved. We can expect the pound to remain under pressure for the time being as markets come to terms with the result of Friday\u2019s referendum vote. Stephen King, HSBC\u2019s chief economist, also sees the pound falling: Newsflash: UK banks have taken \u00a33bn of liquidity from the Bank of England in a special auction. That money is meant to help them handle the repercussions of the Brexit vote last week. This is the third such auction - last week, banks only took \u00a3370m, and the previous week they took \u00a32.4bn. If there were massive stresses in the City now, presumably banks would have asked for rather more money. The BoE says that it received bids for over \u00a36bn, but banks were offering relatively low-quality assets as collateral, so many bids were turned down. Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson has warned that Chinese business partners are already pulling investment from the UK after the EU referendum. Speaking to The Guardian, he warned that last week\u2019s historic vote will cost \u201cthousands of jobs\u201d. Branson told my colleague Rob Davies that: \u201cI met with a group of Chinese businessmen yesterday morning who have invested heavily in England and who are now going to stop investing and withdraw investments they\u2019ve already made.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid that based on misinformation, people voted for Brexit, which is basically voting for a way of shooting themselves in the foot. The last 2 days has been absolute pandemonium worldwide in the markets, the pound crashing, the stock markets crashing, and we are heading rapidly towards a recession again. It\u2019s just too sad, so so sad. Branson also laid into the Leave campaign for misleading voters during the referendum campaign, saying \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of workers will pay the price. \u201cBusinesspeople do not want politicians to completely and utterly wreck the hard work they\u2019ve done for years and years and that is effectively what happened. Thousands and thousands of jobs will be lost as a result of this. Thousands of jobs that would have been created will be lost and the knock-on effect will be so dire. \u201cThe sad thing is I really think Brexiters were misled and did not realise. People said it was scaremongering. It wasn\u2019t scaremongering and the last 48 hours have proved that.\u201d As mentioned at 8.50am, Branson is pushing for a second referendum vote. Branson\u2019s Virgin Money challenger bank has been badly hit by the referendum result, with shares tumbling by 40% since Friday morning. The boss of Royal Bank of Scotland has written to staff, warning that the EU referendum decision has created \u201cshort, medium and longterm\u201d economic uncertainties, according to Reuters. New Zealand-born Ross McEwan told staff that RBS was well-prepared, and also urged them to support diversity in the workplace: \u201cAs someone born outside the UK, I see one of this country\u2019s biggest strengths as its openness to the rest of the world, and the people of it. As a major employer and backer of the economy we have a duty to ensure that we reflect that.. \u201cThe diversity of those who make up this bank at every level is key to our success. In uncertain times I want to ensure that everyone understands that.\u201d Shares in RBS have risen by 3% this morning, but are still down by roughly a quarter since the referendum polls closed. At 180p, they are far from the 502p level where the taxpayer would sell its 72% stake without making a loss. George Osborne has also ruled himself out of becoming the next prime minister. There has been speculation that he could back Leave campaigner Boris Johnson, perhaps in return for becoming foreign secretary. Home secretary Theresa May is also seen as a frontrunner, though. Chancellor George Osborne has predicted more market turbulence, as Britain faces up to life outside the European Union. Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning, he said: We are in a prolonged period of economic adjustment \u2026 it will not be as economically rosy as life inside the EU. It\u2019s very clear that the country is going to be poorer as a result of what is happening to the economy. Osborne also warned that Britain faces higher taxes, and lower spending, to address the economic damage caused by the Brexit vote. Our Politics Liveblog has full details: Two major British companies, engine maker Rolls-Royce and the insurer Legal &amp; General, have tried to shareholders that the UK referendum result won\u2019t sink their operations. Rolls-Royce told the City this morning that its outlook is unchanged, while L&amp;G argues that the long-term trends in insurance are unchanged.... Germany\u2019s financial newspaper, Handelsblatt, is predicting a surge of banking jobs into Frankfurt from the City. Online grocer Ocado has warned that the recent slump in sterling is likely to sent supermarket prices soaring. Chief executive Tim Steiner said the weaker pound may lead to \u201cinflationary pressure\u201d, but also told shareholders that he doesn\u2019t believe Brexit will cause a sudden crash in the UK retail market. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, predicts that inflation will hit 3% next year, over the UK\u2019s 2% target. That\u2019s because it will cost more to import goods from abroad. Kit Juckes, currency expert at French bank Societe Generale, isn\u2019t impressed by the pound\u2019s small rally this morning (to $1.335 from $1.32 last night) He is still worried about the political vacuum in Britain: Markets are bouncing, and can bounce further but the clouds on the horizon are dark, and they\u2019re real. Sterling can bounce to $1.35 for example- but the UK has no Government and no plan for the future. Billionaire businessman Sir Richard Branson has called for a second EU referendum this morning. Speaking on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, he also revealed that his Virgin Money operation has abandoned a deal, since Britain voted for Brexit.... Is a second referendum possible? Well, it\u2019s not unprecedented in European politics. And this morning, government minister Jeremy Hunt suggested that the next Prime Minister must be allowed to \u201cnegotiate a deal\u201d with Brussels and \u201cput it to the British people\u201d by either calling a general election or having another referendum. However, Brexit supporters are unlikely to welcome the idea of a rerun... One rally doesn\u2019t mean the Brexit crisis is over, remember.... It may seem curious that shares in London are rising, hours after Britain lost its AAA credit rating. But Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, reckons S&amp;P\u2019s downgrade may actually be encouraging investors back into the market. It still seems as if we\u2019re a long way from the dust settling, but the FTSE-100 is starting Tuesday\u2019s session with a triple digit bounce. Yes we\u2019ve seen three ratings downgrades for the UK overnight, but taking a glass-half-full perspective, this also means that just a little of the uncertainty is starting to ebb away. Some stocks have taken a while to clear the auction, but this is a case of bargain hunters clamouring to get in. And there could be bargains on the table, if you think Brexit won\u2019t cause economic mayhem. Take housebuilder Persimmon, for example. Its shares are up 7% at \u00a314.07. Last Thursday, they cost \u00a321 each.... The French and German stock markets are also up by around 2% this morning, matching the recovery in London. European stock markets are rallying at the start of trading, after two days of big falls. In London, the FTSE 100 has jumped by 125 points, or around 2%, to 6,109 - recovering some of yesterday\u2019s losses. Every share has risen, led by builders \u2013 who endured the brunt of the Brexit backlash. Mike van Dulken and Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets reckon that the markets may be calming down, pointing to the small recovery in the pound overnight. Sterling is strengthening for the first time since Friday\u2019s surprise referendum result on hopes policymakers are working to limit the economic fallout Over in Asia, governments are considering whether to launch new stimulus packages to protect their firms from the consequences of Brexit. From Toyko, Justin McCurry explains: Japan\u2019s economy minister, Nobuteru Ishihara, said on Tuesday that stimulus measures were likely to include assistance for small businesses. \u201cThere are concerns about lessening the impact of the British referendum on Japan\u2019s small and medium-sized companies,\u201d Ishihara said. \u201cTaking steps to provide liquidity to small firms could be a big factor in economic stimulus steps that we compile.\u201d The Brexit shock has left UK companies worried about losing sales from overseas clients. Our North of England editor, Helen Pidd, flags up that one small business is already seeing demand dry up: After two days of intense pummelling, the British pound is clambering off the mat this morning. Sterling has gained almost one cent against the US dollar so far today, to $1.3303. Yesterday it hit a 30-year low of $1.3118, so it\u2019s a small recovery (given the pound was worth $1.45 last week). Global stock markets have suffered their biggest two-day rout ever, thanks to Britain\u2019s shock decision to vote to leave the EU. Yesterday, $930bn was wiped off the world\u2019s stock markets, in a fresh bout of selling. That followed the rout on Friday, which destroyed $2.03 trillion of value. Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, explains that American investors are increasingly worried about the crisis, and its impact on their economy. \u201cFriday was seen as a U.K. \u2013 E.U. problem, with the U.S suffering some damage on the side lines \u2013 Monday\u2019s global declines paint a more involved U.S. participation.\u201d The bottom-line is we may still be in the knee-jerk reaction phase, but continued deterioration can feed on itself.\u201d S&amp;P\u2019s Global Broad Market index, known as the BMI, has fallen almost 6.9% since Thursday night, its biggest loss in cash terms ever. The scale of the loses shows how unprepared investors were for the Leave campaign\u2019s surprise victory in the early hours of Friday morning. In Britain, the FTSE 100 has fallen by over 5% over the last two days, with bank shares sliding to their lowest levels since the 2008 financial crisis. America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 index, the broadest stock index, has lost 5.37% -- in its worst two-day decline since last August. Good morning. Like the average England football fan this morning, the financial markets are in a gloomy and dejected mood. The shock of seeing the UK vote to leave the European Union last week continues to reverberate around the global economy, with economists fearing that global growth will take a hit. Last night, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s and Fitch both downgraded Britain\u2019s credit rating to AA, two notches below the top AAA rating, warning that growth will be significantly weaker than previously expected. That only adds to worries about the UK economy, which have sent shares in banks and building companies reeling since Friday morning. After two days of heavy falls, European stock markets are expected to claw back some losses this morning. The FTSE 100 is predicted to rise by around 1%. But investors should be cautious in the current climate; there is just too much uncertainty around The Bank of England is doing its bit to stem the crisis. Later today it will offer UK banks the chance to stock up on liquidity to help them through the Brexit crisis, in a special liquidity auction. That will show how worried the City is about financial conditions. It\u2019ll be a busy day in politics too, with David Cameron slinking off to Brussels to face fellow leaders for the first time since his referendum gamble backfired - taking his career with it. He\u2019ll leave behind a cabinet full of scheming ministers, wondering who might become the next prime minister. But the opposition Labour party is doing its best to match the Tories in the shambles stakes, with scores of MPs trying to dislodge their leader. Jeremy Corbyn is gripping his seat tightly, though, and promising to go nowhere. Our Politics Liveblog will have all the action in Westminster and Brussels:",

We have moved from a position of security and stability, to one where we do not even know who will lead the two main political parties in a year\u2019s time.

It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The UK\u2019s decision to leave the European Union will be disruptive for US global banks with significant operations in the UK and will weigh on their profitability in the short to medium term, Fitch Ratings says. However, the impact is likely to be moderate as we believe they will be able to operate through other EU legal entities.</p> <p>US global banks are likely to start strategically implementing parts of their contingency plans rather than wait for trade and service arrangements to be agreed. Resolution planning for US global systemically important banks was constructive for their Brexit contingency planning because of the requirement to rationalize and understand their global legal entity structure and activities.<br></p> <p>Restructuring operations will depend on license status in various jurisdictions, as well as establishing operational scale, potentially reallocating capital and relocating where trades and clients are booked. Relocation of staff is likely to follow; for example, ahead of the referendum, JP Morgan had announced that as many as 4,000 of its UK roles could be shifted out of the country.<br></p> <p>Management will have to decide where to focus its European operations, depending on language requirements, staff expertise and incentives offered by these countries.

It is unlikely to have any immediate implications for Ireland\u2019s sovereign rating in the near term, but a medium-term rating impact would be possible if the economic dislocation of Brexit were to prove severe.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s economy is highly exposed to Brexit. According to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the UK accounted for 12.6% of Ireland\u2019s total goods exports in January-April 2016, and 24% of total goods imports. The UK also accounted for 20% of total services exports in 2014. Total goods and services exports to the UK are equivalent to around 17% of GDP. There could be significant sector-specific fall out. For example, the UK accounts for 49% of Irish agricultural exports.</p> <p>A UK slowdown, sterling depreciation and potential future trade barriers between Ireland and the UK would weigh on Irish exports, economic growth and employment; although the full impact will only become clear as EU-UK negotiations develop. We think the most important near-term impact will be through reduced domestic confidence.</p> <p>In the medium term, Ireland could gain from a shift of some foreign direct investment from the UK to the EU or from international businesses relocating from the UK, but this is highly uncertain.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Fitch also warns that political tensions between the Republic and Northern Ireland could rise (on Saturday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/26/northern-ireland-republic-peace-brexit-border\">Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Martin McGuinness, deputy first minister for Northern Ireland, called for a poll on reunification</a>)</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brexit would represent a symbolic moving apart of the UK and Ireland that could weaken confidence in the peace process in Northern Ireland and potentially impair cross-border relations and trade.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s minority government, which was formed in May after February\u2019s inconclusive election, has outlined its \u2018Contingency Framework\u2019 that will guide its policy response. This identifies priorities including UK-EU negotiations, UK-Irish relations, trade and investment, and Northern Ireland. It remains to be seen how effective this will be, and some domestic political uncertainty persists given the relatively loose agreement between Fine Gael and Fianna Fail.</p> <p>Lower economic growth would reduce the tax intake, reducing the medium-term fiscal space that the government identified in its recent Summer Economic Statement. Ireland\u2019s commitment to fiscal consolidation during and after its EU-IMF programme leads us to think an increase in fiscal risks would be met with a policy response to continue meeting fiscal targets and limiting the impact on public debt dynamics.</p> <p>Our upgrade of Ireland to \u2018A\u2019 from \u2018A-\u2019 in February reflected the marked fall in government debt to 93.8% of GDP in 2015 from 120% in 2013 driven by strong and broad-based growth and fiscal consolidation.

Investors were spooked after its chief executive, Wilf Walsh, said trading conditions had been more challenging in recent weeks and added: \u201cThe outlook has been further complicated by the outcome of last week\u2019s referendum and we are cautious about the impact the associated uncertainty will have on consumer confidence.\u201d Despite the retailer reporting underlying profits up by a third to \u00a317.3m in the year to 30 April, the shares touched a low of 216.88p before staging a recovery to reach 225p by lunchtime. In previous downturns home furnishings retailers sales have been affected by a slowdown in the housing transactions which are a trigger for purchases. Carpetright revealed that its new financial year had got off to a bumpy start with like-for-like sales down 7.6% in the UK in May but swinging back to growth of 6.3% in June. \u201cIt\u2019s a very strange atmosphere,\u201d said Walsh. \u201cConsumers are not behaving in a pattern.\u201d He said it was too soon to judge what the fallout from the referendum would be. Walsh, a former managing director of the bookmaker Coral, was hired in 2014 to lead a turnaround following several difficult years for the company as sales and profits collapsed during the last recession. Total sales fell 1.3% to \u00a3456.8m after it closed 25 under-performing stores. Walsh is in the process of overhauling the retailer, with a new look for its stores and a push to improve customer service. While the high street brand is well known, the retailer\u2019s own research found that only 50% those surveyed would actually consider shopping there. This year it will spend \u00a310m refurbishing 100 stores, replacing its dated red branding with a more contemporary logo on storefronts and a new staff uniform. It has also expanded its product range to reflect the popularity of hard flooring. \u201cWhile we have a long journey ahead in transforming Carpetright, we have a clear direction and are confident that our plans for repositioning the business will yield positive results,\u201d said Walsh. Shore Capital analyst George Mensah said the pound\u2019s weakness following the UK vote to leave the EU would hit Carpetright\u2019s sourcing costs as 75% of materials for flooring are imported, largely from mainland Europe. \u201cThe impact of the outcome of the referendum should predominantly come from the impact on imports and also the consequent changes in consumer confidence and the dynamics of the housing market following the decision,\u201d he said. \u201cWhilse mindful of short-term headwinds that may impact consumer sentiment, we still remain positive on the company as we believe the changes implemented by the company are delivering enhanced returns for shareholders.\u201d",

Whatever the leave side is saying about the fallout from the Brexit vote, the effects are very real and already starting to hit home.\u201d UK banks, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, along with the housebuilders, made gains after heavy losses in the previous two sessions. A Bank of England offer of special cash to the banking sector appeared to show no obvious tensions in the market. In the last of three special lending operations announced before the referendum in an effort to quell anxiety about the health of the banking system, \u00a33.1bn of extra liquidity was provided to banks. While this was 10 times as much as in the previous auction, the Bank\u2019s data showed that banks were not scrambling to pay high sums for the loans provided. After Monday\u2019s rout in RBS shares, when they lost 25% at one stage, the bank\u2019s chief executive wrote to staff to reassure them that it had made contingency plans for a Brexit vote. Aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royceand insurer Legal &amp; General also reassured shareholders. However, entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson sounded the alarm about thousands of job losses caused by investors pulling business from the UK. Economists are downgrading their forecasts for the UK economy.Rundle, said thedowngrades from credit rating agencies were the \u201cfirst real signal that the Brexit vote has serious real-world repercussions for people\u2019s finances\u201d. He added: \u201cBritain still has a large deficit and is heading into a recession \u2013 a ratings downgrade that makes government borrowing more expensive is the last thing the country needs if the tax take is reduced.\u201d Housebuilder Redrow, though, said house sales would not be affected by the Brexit vote, predicting that pretax profits for the year to September would hit the top end of analysts\u2019 estimates, of \u00a3240m. Sterling, which hit a 31-year low of $1.3118 on Monday, has been regarded as main barometer to the market\u2019s attitude to the EU referendum result. After two days of heavy losses, it gained almost 1% against the US dollar to $1.3350. When London closed, sterling had fallen back to $1.33. Against the euro, it rose to \u20ac1.211, but was later trading at \u20ac1.203. Kit Juckes at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said: \u201cMarkets are bouncing, and can bounce further but the clouds on the horizon are dark, and they\u2019re real. Sterling can bounce to $1.35 for example \u2013 but the UK has no government and no plan for the future.\u201d In Asia, however, stock markets struggled to shrug off the Brexit vote. Japan\u2019s Nikkei was only just in positive territory at 15,323.14 while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng closed 0.25% lower at 20,176.42. Several Asian governments are preparing stimulus packages: Japan\u2019s economy minister said measures were likely to include assistance for small businesses. David Cameron is heading to Brussels to explain the Brexit vote to Europe\u2019s leaders at a two-day summit. Economists at Daiwa Capital Markets said: \u201cOver dinner, Cameron will have to explain the UK\u2019s post-referendum position and plead for constructive negotiations while facing a barrage of criticism from other leaders. And, of course, the weakness of the UK bargaining position will be laid bare when Cameron will be excluded from discussions among the remaining 27 member state leaders.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has agreed to pay $14.7bn to settle claims generated by its emissions rigging scandal and to buy back cars from consumers at pre-scandal prices, the Department of Justice announced on Tuesday. Volkswagen\u2019s wrongdoing constituted \u201cthe most flagrant violations of our consumer and environmental laws in our country\u2019s history\u201d, deputy US attorney general Sally Yates said announcing the agreement. \u201cWe cannot undo the damage that\u2019s been done to our air quality, but we can offset that damage.\u201d One piece of the settlement, an estimated $10bn due to consumers, was reported last week and would come to an average payout of about $21,000 per vehicle owner for the 500,000 Americans affected. The rest of the $14.7bn includes a $2.7bn settlement paid to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and $2bn in investment to support zero-emission vehicles. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also formally banned the software used to beat the emissions tests. The fines are not the end of VW\u2019s woes. A Department of Justice criminal investigation is ongoing, as is the inquiry of the German government. If settlements with General Motors and Toyota are anything to go on, the cost of the criminal case to VW could exceed another $1bn, said Carl Tobias, Williams chair in law at the University of Richmond. \u201cWhat\u2019s critical is this is an historic settlement certainly in terms of amount but also in terms of what it covers or tries to cover,\u201d said Tobias. \u201cThis is a real step forward: people who own the vehicles seem to be getting a pretty good deal especially with the buybacks and the compensation on top of that.\u201d \u201cThis is the largest monetary mitigation obligation in the history of the Clean Air Act,\u201d said Yates. \u201cThe settlements do not address any potential criminal liability, although I can assure you that our criminal investigation is active and ongoing.\u201d \u201cVolkswagen has to swallow a $15bn pill, but it needs to take this medicine in order to move on,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, director of industry analysis for auto pricing firm Edmunds. \u201cThis massive financial hit won\u2019t magically make VW\u2019s troubles disappear overnight, and it still has a long road ahead to repair its reputation among car shoppers. The company got a head start earlier this month by announcing a long-term commitment to electrification, but it will be a long time before shoppers will trust VW as an environmentally friendly brand.\u201d Yates said the settlement was fitting given the damage wrought by the alleged cheating. \u201cWe cannot undo the damage it ha\u0080\u0099s done to our air quality,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t suck the NOx out of the air.\u201d The settlements will be meted out among the various plaintiffs, among them the state of New York, which partially outlined its own use of the awarded funds: $115m for environmental projects to improve New York\u2019s air quality, and $30m to the state\u2019s general fund. \u201cMake no mistake: we will continue to investigate and pursue Volkswagen for its violation of our environmental laws, and we will seek the imposition of additional penalties in amounts sufficient to ensure that Volkswagen and any other car manufacturer complies with the standards required of them,\u201d said New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman. The affected cars are the 2009 through 2015 Volkswagen TDI diesel models of Jettas, Passats, Golfs and Beetles as well as the TDI Audi A3. \u201cI want this agreement to remind every American that the EPA is on the job and we have your back when companies break rules designed to protect your health and when cheaters stack the deck against businesses that follow the law,\u201d said EPA administrator Gina McCarthy.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK grocery market has fallen into decline for the first time this year as the performance of all four major supermarkets worsened. Asda\u2019s sales slid by 5.9% \u2013 its worst performance on record and the biggest slump in the market. Tesco was the best of the major chains, with sales down 1.3% according to analysis from Kantar Worldpanel published on Tuesday. That compares with falls of 5.1% and 1% revealed last month. In contrast, discounters Aldi and Lidl continue to see double-digit growth, with sales up 11.5% and 13.8% respectively, taking their combined market share to a new high of 10.5%. Aldi is now only a hair\u2019s breadth from overtaking the Co-op to become the UK\u2019s fifth largest supermarket. The latest figures do not include the period after the referendum, but Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said the decision to leave the EU was likely to help bolster the discounters further. \u201cWith an estimated 40% of the food we consume sourced from overseas, any long-term change in exchange rates may threaten the current period of cheaper groceries. Historically, higher prices have led to consumers looking for less expensive alternatives such as own-label products, seeking out brands on promotion or visiting cheaper retailers,\u201d he said. The immediate economic uncertainty was unlikely to cause a substantial fall in grocery volumes, McKevitt said, if patterns followed those seen during the 2008 financial crisis when basic food, drinks and household sales proved resilient. A rise in prices may even be helpful for the major supermarkets that declined amid a 1.4% drop in grocery prices over the three-month period. Total sales at Tesco and Morrisons were also hit by store closures as the businesses attempted to adjust to shoppers\u2019 changing habits. Mike Watkins, Nielsen\u2019s UK head of retailer and business insight, said: \u201cDeflation is no longer deepening and, with the effect on figures of some store closures last year soon to be behind us, we can be more optimistic about a supermarket recovery later this year.\u201d Analysts at Nielsen said supermarket sales had risen in the four weeks to 18 June, helped by a increase in sales of snacks, alcohol and delicatessen items during the first period of the Euro 2016 football championship. Beers, wines and spirits sales increased 6.2% year-on-year during the period, while crisps and other snacks rose 4.2%, helping the industry achieve its first monthly sales rise for nearly a year. However, England\u2019s early exit after losing to Iceland on Monday night is likely to bring any Euro 2016 cheer to an end.",

Historically, higher prices have led to consumers looking for less expensive alternatives such as own-label products, seeking out brands on promotion or visiting cheaper retailers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The immediate economic uncertainty was unlikely to cause a substantial fall in grocery volumes, McKevitt said, if patterns followed those seen during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\">2008 financial crisis</a> when basic food, drinks and household sales proved resilient.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/business-comes-to-terms-brexit-shares-jobs-prices\">rise in prices</a> may even be helpful for the major supermarkets that declined amid a 1.4% drop in grocery prices over the three-month period. Total sales at Tesco and Morrisons were also hit by store closures as the businesses attempted to adjust to shoppers\u2019 changing habits.</p> <p>Mike Watkins, Nielsen\u2019s UK head of retailer and business insight, said: \u201cDeflation is no longer deepening and, with the effect on figures of some store closures last year soon to be behind us, we can be more optimistic about a supermarket recovery later this year.\u201d</p> <p>Analysts at Nielsen said supermarket sales had risen in the four weeks to 18 June, helped by a increase in sales of snacks, alcohol and delicatessen items during the first period of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016\">Euro 2016</a> football championship. Beers, wines and spirits sales increased 6.2% year-on-year during the period, while crisps and other snacks rose 4.2%, helping the industry achieve its first monthly sales rise for nearly a year.</p> <p>However, England\u2019s early exit after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/27/england-iceland-euro-2016-match-report\">losing to Iceland</a> on Monday night is likely to bring any Euro 2016 cheer to an end.<br></p>",

A balance of UK retailers saying sales rose minus those who reported falling sales fell to 4% in June, down from 7% in May, according to the Confederation of British Industry\u2019s latest snapshot of the retail sector (pdf). The survey was conducted between 26 May and 14 June \u2013 before the UK\u2019s shock vote to leave the EU. Grocers, furniture and carpet shops, along with hardware and DIY stores, reported a pickup in sales in the year to June. But growth slowed at clothing retailers and sales fell at department stores, specialist food and drink retailers, and shops selling durable household goods such as cookers and washing machines. Retailers were expecting sales to improve in July, with the balance improving to -10% from -5% in June, while orders were expected to continue falling. The CBI said: \u201cRetail sales reported weak growth in the year to June, beating expectations of a modest fall and lifting sales slightly above average for the time of year.\u201d Orders placed on suppliers fell in June, albeit at a slower pace than in the previous month. Growth in the volume of internet sales slowed in the year to June, with the survey balance falling below the long-run average. However, internet sales growth was expected to pick up strongly in July. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the survey suggested \u201cconsumers were relatively cautious in their spending in the run-up to the EU referendum, but did not completely keep their hands in their pockets\u201d. He continued: \u201cThere is not much evidence in the survey of retail sales getting a significant boost from the European football championships, although this only started on 10 June, while the CBI survey only ran until 14 June. \u201cA massive question now is how well or badly will retail sales perform in July following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU? \u201cFollowing the vote to leave the EU, the strong suspicion is that consumer spending will be severely pressurised for some time as a consequence of increased uncertainty, likely higher unemployment and squeezed purchased power. It is probable purchasing power will be squeezed by inflation being pushed up markedly by a sharp fall in sterling.\u201d A separate report from Lloyds bank showed that consumer spending on essentials fell again last month, although the pace of decline was the slowest since March 2015. People spent 0.4% less on essentials year-on-year in May, the 18th consecutive month of decline. Food and drink accounts for 40% of all essential spending. This turned positive, at 0.1%, following a 0.7% drop in April. Spending on fuel continued to fall, by 4.4% in May.",

      "bodyText": "Virgin billionaire, Sir Richard Branson, says Chinese business partners are already pulling investment from the UK in the light of the EU referendum vote, and warned that \u201cthousands of jobs will be lost\u201d. Speaking at the final round of Voom, a competition for young entrepreneurs hoping to secure funding and support from Virgin, Branson warned that the business climate after the Brexit vote was already hurting the economy. \u201cI met with a group of Chinese businessmen yesterday morning who have invested heavily in England and who are now going to stop investing and withdraw investments they\u2019ve already made,\u201d Branson told the Guardian. He said his opinion that leaving the EU would damage investment in Britain was shared by \u201cevery single person I\u2019ve met from overseas\u201d. Branson, whose business empire includes airline Virgin Atlantic and home broadband and TV provider Virgin Media, blamed pro-Brexit politicians for causing chaos in global markets, accusing them of misleading the public. Branson also has a stake in Virgin Money, which has suffered a 40% slump in its shares since the referendum. \u201cBusinesspeople do not want politicians to completely and utterly wreck the hard work they\u2019ve done for years and years and that is effectively what happened,\u201d Branson said. \u201cThousands and thousands of jobs will be lost as a result of this. Thousands of jobs that would have been created will be lost and the knock-on effect will be so dire. \u201cThe sad thing is I really think Brexiters were misled and did not realise. People said it was scaremongering. It wasn\u2019t scaremongering and the last 48 hours have proved that.\u201d Earlier in the week, Branson, who campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU, called on the government to consider holding a second referendum, \u201cbased on the misrepresentations made by the leave campaign\u201d. The entrepreneur does not have the right to vote in UK elections because he lives in the British Virgin Islands, but has weighed in on the Brexit debate, pointing out that he employs 50,000 people in the UK.",

The Virgin Group founder said Chinese business partners were already pulling investment from the UK after the EU referendum. \u201cI met with a group of Chinese businessmen yesterday morning who have invested heavily in England and who are now going to stop investing and withdraw investments they\u2019ve already made,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe last two days has been absolute pandemonium worldwide in the markets, the pound crashing, the stock markets crashing, and we are heading rapidly towards a recession again. It\u2019s just too sad, so so sad.\u201d However, the engine maker Rolls-Royce, the insurer Legal &amp; General and the bailed-out banks Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group issued reassuring statements. Rolls-Royce, which wrote to staff in the run-up to the referendum to say it wanted to remain, said: \u201cAlthough this is not the outcome the company would have chosen, Rolls-Royce remains committed to the United Kingdom where we are headquartered, directly employ over 23,000 \u2026 workers and where we carry out a significant majority of our research and development.\u201d It said the referendum result would have no immediate impact on Rolls\u2019 day-to-day business, while the longer-term impact would \u201cdepend upon the relationships that are established between the UK, the EU and the rest of the world over the coming years\u201d. Legal &amp; General \u2013 which also named the former Treasury mandarin Sir John Kingman as it chairman \u2013 said long-term trends, such as ageing populations and globalisation of asset markets, were \u201csubstantially unaffected by the EU referendum result\u201d. The company said it had been planning for a 50-50 probability of a vote for the UK to leave, and had removed risks from its portfolios, for example by reducing its exposure to European banks\u2019 subordinated debt. As a result, its balance sheet had \u201cdemonstrated its resilience to market volatility\u201d. It added: \u201cWe have not taken any action as a result of the downgrade of UK sovereign debt by Moody\u2019s, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s and Fitch because we had already treated UK sovereign debt as AA-rated in our internal model.\u201d The Shore Capital analyst Eamonn Flanagan said the insurer had issued a \u201cpretty robust statement in response to the market turmoil following the Brexit vote\u201d. RBS and Lloyds targeted their staff. Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, sent a memo to the bank\u2019s 90,000 employees following the turbulence it its share price on Monday, when at its worst it was down 25% to levels not seen since the financial crisis. \u201cDespite the noisy fallout from the vote, many of the fundamentals remain true. Our view as a bank is that the UK remains a large, well-developed economy with good long-term prospects. It\u2019s our home market and our job as a leading bank here is to help it succeed,\u201d he said. A New Zealander, McEwan said: \u201cAs someone born outside the UK, I see one of this country\u2019s biggest strengths as its openness to the rest of the world and the people of it. As a major employer and backer of the economy we have a duty to ensure that we reflect that. The diversity of those who make up this bank at every level is key to our success. In uncertain times I want to ensure that everyone understands that.\u201d He told staff that RBS had made contingency plans: \u201cOur day one plan worked, but of course the result of the vote carries with it a range of unknowns about the short, medium and long-term prospects for the UK and its economy,\u201d he said. \u201cAdded to this we now have a period of political uncertainty.\u201d Before the vote, McEwan was one of the first bankers to warn that Brexit would slow down banking. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, chief executive of Lloyds, told staff the bank\u2019s strategy \u2013 to be a UK-focused, low risk retail and commercial bank \u2013 remained unchanged. \u201cI know that the referendum result has had an impact on the share price of many companies, including ours, but I believe the fundamentals of the group are strong and that is a testament to the hard work all of us have done over the last few years,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It may well be a dead cat bounce rather than a convincing recovery from the recent rout, but leading shares have moved sharply higher for the first time since the shock Brexit vote. The FTSE 100 has added 132.41 points or 2.22% to 6114.61 while the mid-cap FTSE 250 index - far more exposed to the domestic UK economy - is up 2.74%. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Although the FTSE opened upbeat in London this morning, investors should keep in mind that Moody\u2019s, S&amp;P and Fitch have downgraded the UK\u2019s credit rating. And even if the UK banks are better bid at the early hours of trading in London, the market is now pricing in the possibility of a rate cut from the Bank of England (BoE) in an effort to temper potential economic damages as the UK prepares to quit the European Union. We warn that the credit rating downgrades and a lower rate outlook are important red flags that investors should consider before blindly jumping on the back of a bull. We restate that the volatility is a sign of stress on both sides. Rapid gains are as dangerous as wild sell-offs. Retailers have risen despite downgrades from Citigroup, with Next up 415p to \u00a347.99 and Marks &amp; Spencer 15.9p higher at 301.1p. Online grocer Ocado has climbed 20.6p to 228.7p after its latest update, despite no further news on an international deal. Analyst Clive Black at Shore Capital kept his sell recommendation but said: All in all, Ocado delivered good sales growth of nearly 14% in a tough market, growth similar to Aldi and Lidl it should be said. However, despite its pure-play online model, it is not immune from market conditions. Amazon Fresh steps up the competitive intensity a good deal in a core market to our minds. Those tough conditions can be expected to weigh upon the group\u2019s margins, as will the P&amp;L catching up with capital expenditure and software amortisation. In its present form Ocado stock appears still to be overvalued to us. Key near-term developments are what happens with Morrisons [warehouse discussions], which may yet lead us to be more neutral on the stock if a mutually beneficial outcome ensues, and the materiality of any international expansion. Legal &amp; General is up 14.2p to 179.2p after reassuring on its balance sheet while Rolls-Royce has risen 13.5p to 665.5p following an update saying it was on track to meet forecasts. Among the banks, Barclays is 7.6p better at 134.80p and Lloyds Banking Group has added 3.13p to 54.28p. But after recent surges as investors sought havens, there has been some profit taking in gold and silver miners, with Fresnillo falling 62p to \u00a314.21 and Randgold Resources down 225p at \u00a378.10. G4S has climbed 15p to 179p as analysts at Credit Suisse raised their recommendation from neutral to outperform and their target price from 200p to 210p. They said there were four reasons for the upgrade: 1) G4S is a significant beneficiary of sterling weakness, which we assume falls 10% across the board from its pre-referendum levels. 2) G4S has had more than its share of issues in recent years but the vast majority of its underlying business is stable and defensive. 3) We expect asset sales over the next 18 months, which combined with improved working capital management should lead to de-leveraging and free cash flow coverage of the dividend. 4) At 9.6 times 2017 estimated PE with a (covered) 5.4% dividend yield we view the valuation as attractive. But Credit Suisse downgraded Capita, up 34.5p to 883p, saying: We lower our recommendation to neutral (from outperform) and target price to 900p (from 1250p) to reflect the impact we believe Brexit will have on big ticket contract and \u2018transactional\u2019 driven revenue growth in the foreseeable future. Our earnings per share estimates fall by 3% for 2016 but a much more significant 10%-11% for 2017 and 2018. Lower down the market Ceres Power Holdings has climbed 2.6% to 8.75p as finalised an agreement with Nissan to develop a solid oxide fuel cell to extend the range of electric vehicles.",

Shawbrook shares had already been caught up in the market rout following the Brexit vote, losing 45% of their value in the previous two days.

Days after the UK referendum result wiped almost 8% off Japanese shares and sent the yen up sharply against the US dollar, officials in Tokyo have started drawing up plans to minimise Brexit\u2019s impact on the world\u2019s third-biggest economy.

The Japanese finance minister, Taro Aso, said on Tuesday that financial markets were calmer but stressed the need to keep a close watch on currency markets and said he stood ready to respond if necessary. Japan\u2019s financial authorities have not ruled out intervening in currency markets to stem the yen\u2019s rise, despite warnings against intervention from the US. The US treasury secretary, Jack Lew, told CNBC on Monday: \u201cUnilateral action to intervene would be destabilising.\u201d David Donabedian, chief investment officer of Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management, said: \u201cMarkets already appear to be pricing in a full-blown recession in the UK and rising recession risk in the rest of Europe.\u201d South Korea\u2019s government said on Tuesday it would propose a supplementary budget shield of around 10 trillion won ($8.44bn), with Brexit turmoil as well as domestic risks seen as weighing on its decision-making.

Li, speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the city of Tianjin, said China hoped for a united and stable EU and a prosperous United Kingdom, but added: \u201cAgainst the backdrop of globalisation, it\u2019s impossible for each country to talk about its own development discarding the world economic environment.\u201d The British prime minister, David Cameron, insisted on Monday that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union would not send the economy into a tailspin, even as Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s stripped the UK of its top credit rating. As stock markets and the pound continued to decline, Cameron insisted the British economy was robust and could withstand the shockwaves created by the result. Hours after he spoke Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s knocked the UK\u2019s sovereign rating by two notches, from AAA to AA, saying an exit would lead to a \u201cless predictable, stable and effective policy framework in the UK\u201d.
