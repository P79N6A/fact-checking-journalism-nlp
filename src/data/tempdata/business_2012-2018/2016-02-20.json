      "bodyText": "Unemployment has reached its lowest level since before the Great Recession, but Charles Goldstein, 60, does not feel like celebrating. He is still unemployed. He has no job. No savings. No retirement. As wind and rain pummeled the streets of New Brunswick last Tuesday, Goldstein and nine other long-term unemployed New-Jerseyans met the US Labor secretary, Tom Perez. The purpose of the trip for Perez was to make a \u201chouse call\u201d \u2013 to meet some of New Jersey\u2019s older long-term unemployed residents and find out what hurdles they faced while looking for a job. \u201cWe study a lot of data in this job, but for me, the most important thing to do in this job is to make house calls. Because behind every data point is a person, a human being with a story to tell,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t make house calls in this job, you don\u2019t do this job well.\u201d After asking them to call him Tom, the secretary encouraged them to share their experience as well as be critical about what the US Department of Labor could do better. \u201cI haven\u2019t had an original idea in my life,\u201d said Perez, laughing. \u201cBut what I pride myself in, is being a good listener.\u201d He pointed out that one of the provisions in the president\u2019s 2016 budget came out of a similar meeting with unemployed Americans. The provision would allow people who have been unemployed for more than 26 weeks, to make withdrawals from their individual retirement arrangements (IRAs) without having to pay the 10% early withdrawal penalty tax. Goldstein said he knows what\u2019s it like to need that money. \u201cI have no IRAs left. They are completely wiped out. The savings bonds since I was a kid \u2013 all gone! Were it not for the fact that my wife has a good job, I\u2019d be homeless. That\u2019s how bad it is,\u201d he said. Perez met New Jersey\u2019s unemployed 10 days after Barack Obama stood at the podium at the White House briefing room to announce that the US unemployment rate had fallen below 5% for the first time since February 2008. And while the overall unemployment rate has dropped, the focus has now shifted to the historically low labor participation rate as well as what some referred to as the \u201creal unemployment rate\u201d. \u201cWho denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10%?\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders asked last week during a debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Perez does not deny that there is more work to be done and added that he knows from his own experience that \u201call the data is kind of irrelevant when you know somebody who is unemployed, because the unemployment rate feels like it\u2019s 100%.\u201d Goldstein is one of those to whom the headline figures mean little. \u201cThe present statistics \u2013 that for example you point to \u2013 are an antiquated, outdated worthless measure at this point of time. They are 50 years old,\u201d he told Perez. \u201cWe need new metrics that really accurately reflect what the unemployment picture is. The present statistic of 4.9% is not just meaningless to people who are unemployed, it\u2019s meaningless. Period.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s surely true that the economy \u2018feels\u2019 less healthy to lots of people than a 4.9% unemployment rate suggests,\u201d said Josh Bivens, research and policy director at left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. He pointed out that the Department of Labor has six different measures to figure out how the US labor market is doing. It\u2019s usually the media and the policymakers that focus on that one particular figure, he said. \u201cThere is no perfect way to measure the labor market slack and the headline unemployment rate is looking rosier than some other indicators now, but this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a flawed measure or that something else is the \u2018real\u2019 rate,\u201d Bivens said. Numbers alone can be deceiving. In December, there were about 5.6m job openings. Some analysts have pointed out that the figure represents a skills gap in the US workforce \u2013 that there are not enough skilled workers to fill the available openings. Those looking for jobs argue that the hiring managers are not looking at the right candidates. Those invited to meet Perez on Tuesday had recently signed up for a new program launched at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The program called New Start Career Network focuses on older, long-term unemployed workers, who are paired with coaches and are guided through the job search process. The program was launched in October. In just four months, it has seen almost 700 job-seekers sign up. Their average age is 56 \u2013 about 52% of the participants are between 55 and 64 \u2013 and on average they have been unemployed for about 1.8 years. The program also has about 109 volunteer coaches \u2013 about 55 of them are currently working with 92 job seekers. \u201cWe got people trained, but they are just sitting here,\u201d Judy Miao, a volunteer coach at New Start, told Perez. \u201cHelp us get connected with employers.\u201d According to the labor secretary, the US Department of Labor is kind of like Match.com, but for jobs. It is tasked with creating partnerships between government, employers and potential employees. Perez also agreed that some employers can be hasty in making judgments about potential employees and, thus, leave talent on the table. \u201cThese are the same employers that tell me: \u2018I am bullish about the future, I want to grow my workforce. And I cannot find talented workers.\u2019 That\u2019s when I say: \u2018Hey, I can help. I have got tremendously talented pool of workers,\u2019\u201d said Perez. Even if their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s make it out of the online black hole on to someone\u2019s desk, long-term unemployed job applicants struggle to connect. On Tuesday, Perez heard from Abby Nagel, who has been unemployed for 12 months. \u201cThey tell me: \u2018You are too overqualified,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cTry me,\u201d Perez suggested as a comeback. Nagel shook her head slightly and continued: \u201c\u2026 \u2018You are going to get bored and leave.\u2019\u201d Clifford Biroc who has been out of work since June 2014 said that one of the recruiters he interviewed with told him his job history didn\u2019t \u201csit well\u201d with her. According to him, she told him that he should have done his research and know that the companies he went to work with might downsize in the future. \u201cI would have had trouble on the job hunt,\u201d Perez admitted jokingly, to laughs from the group. It wasn\u2019t all laughs at the roundtable as participants also discussed the loneliness that comes with being unemployed. \u201cThis is not the first time that I have been unemployed, but it\u2019s the first time that I haven\u2019t felt alone, that I haven\u2019t felt isolated, that I haven\u2019t felt there was something wrong or broken with me,\u201d said Goldstein, speaking of what a difference New Start has made. \u201cThey get it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s lonely,\u201d Perez said. \u201cA job is more than a paycheck. A job is your identity. A job is your community.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Low oil and gas prices are close to triggering a wave of bankruptcies and debt defaults among US producers, investors fear. The fall in the oil price to levels that are punishingly low for producers is putting up to $88bn of borrowings potentially at risk. About 30% of the oil and gas industry\u2019s debt is now said to be at distressed levels \u2013 meaning companies are experiencing financial or operational problems severe enough to put them at risk of default or bankruptcy. Producers, especially those fracking for shale gas, have borrowed heavily in the past few years and are now counting the cost as revenues tumble. From around $115 a barrel in July 2014, oil is now hovering nearer $30 a barrel, with fears of a continuing glut. This comes after a shale gas boom in the US coincided with low interest rates in the wake of the financial crisis. \u201cWe effectively had free credit for seven years and an energy transformation, so a lot of capital went into that,\u201d said Leslie Biddle of Serengeti Asset Management, a $1.5bn US hedge fund with significant oil and gas investments. \u201cBut now the capital markets to exploration and production have shut.\u201d Companies on the distressed list are paying interest at 10 percentage points more than Treasury rates. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s (S&amp;P) says the energy sector accounts for around 31% of the $285bn total distressed debt in the US. Some investors are attracted by the high yields on offer and a belief that the oil price of oil will soon rise. Borrowers, meanwhile, are keen to fund investment by issuing bonds in the hope the price of oil will eventually rise again. But sentiment in the sector is worsening the longer the oil price stays low. Many traders had expected an upswing this year, but it has failed to materialise. In the US, 35 exploration and production companies filed for bankruptcy between July 2014 and December 2015, according to a recent Deloitte report. Robert Friend of California-based investment group Pacific Alternative Asset Management said: \u201cThere are going to be big bankruptcies in exploration and production. And it will spread to other industries, especially those that serve the sector.\u201d Debt traders refer to specific \u201cevents\u201d that can shock the market. Early this month US shale producer Chesapeake Energy, in which investor Carl Icahn has a large stake, had to state that it had \u201cno plans to pursue bankruptcy\u201d after its shares collapsed. As traders feared the group could fail under $10bn of bond debt, its shares halved in a day amid rumours that it had appointed restructuring specialists, a move it denied. Chesapeake is one of the biggest US shale gas drillers, but last summer it announced a series of cutbacks as the price of natural gas fell. Some investors think it would be a good thing if it did file for bankruptcy. Biddle said: \u201cHaving Chesapeake file would be decently cathartic. When you get to a filing and go through the process you get new investors who bring in new capital.\u201d Earlier this month, S&amp;P warned that the company\u2019s debt was \u201cunsustainable\u201d. Other energy companies on the distressed list include Denbury Resources, Linn Energy and Transocean, one of the world\u2019s largest offshore drilling contractors, whose debt was downgraded to junk status a year ago. Despite the low oil price, there have been no large-scale energy bankruptcies since the demise of Energy Future Holdings, the former Texas-based TXU, in April 2014. Since the beginning of the year, the global default tally of US bond issuers has risen to 19, from 13 at the same time last year, according to S&amp;P. The credit rating agency says the oil and gas sector accounts for 29.6% of the companies in its distressed category. The oil giants themselves are not immune to debt downgrades, which can raise their borrowing costs. S&amp;P cut Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s credit rating at the beginning of the month, and warned of a \u201csignificant likelihood\u201d it would cut the ratings of several other European oil majors. S&amp;P said the move did not take into account the effects of Shell\u2019s \u00a336bn tie-up with BG Group. It plans to assess the rating of the combined entity by the end of June. Alex Griaznov of S&amp;P said the major energy groups would be able to maintain their investment-grade status: \u201cThey have scale, scope, a diversification of operations and an ability to address market conditions with reductions in capital expenditures and operating costs.\u201d",

Early this month US shale producer Chesapeake Energy, in which investor Carl Icahn has a large stake, had to state that it had \u201cno plans to pursue bankruptcy\u201d after its shares collapsed. As traders feared the group could fail under $10bn of bond debt, its shares halved in a day amid rumours that it had appointed restructuring specialists, a move it denied.</p> <p>Chesapeake is one of the biggest US shale gas drillers, but last summer it announced a series of cutbacks as the price of natural gas fell. Some investors think it would be a good thing if it did file for bankruptcy.</p> <p>Biddle said: \u201cHaving Chesapeake file would be decently cathartic. When you get to a filing and go through the process you get new investors who bring in new capital.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month, S&amp;P warned that the company\u2019s debt was \u201cunsustainable\u201d.</p> <p>Other energy companies on the distressed list include Denbury Resources, Linn Energy and Transocean, one of the world\u2019s largest offshore drilling contractors, whose debt was downgraded to junk status a year ago.</p> <p>Despite the low oil price, there have been no large-scale energy bankruptcies since the demise of Energy Future Holdings, the former Texas-based TXU, in April 2014. Since the beginning of the year, the global default tally of US bond issuers has risen to 19, from 13 at the same time last year, according to S&amp;P. The credit rating agency says the oil and gas sector accounts for 29.6% of the companies in its distressed category.</p> <p>The oil giants themselves are not immune to debt downgrades, which can raise their borrowing costs. S&amp;P cut Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s credit rating at the beginning of the month, and warned of a \u201csignificant likelihood\u201d it would cut the ratings of several other European oil majors.</p> <p>S&amp;P said the move did not take into account the effects of Shell\u2019s \u00a336bn tie-up with BG Group. It plans to assess the rating of the combined entity by the end of June.</p> <p>Alex Griaznov of S&amp;P said the major energy groups would be able to maintain their investment-grade status: \u201cThey have scale, scope, a diversification of operations and an ability to address market conditions with reductions in capital expenditures and operating costs.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Iranian endorsement of a plan by its arch regional rival, Saudi Arabia, to stabilise global oil prices could be seen as a diplomatic coup for Riyadh. However, Tehran\u2019s support for a production freeze has not been driven by a new desire for political rapprochement as much as acceptance of a greater enemy: collapsed commodity prices. The markets are flooded in crude at a time when demand is faltering due to the slowdown in expected growth from key importers such as China. Desperate times require desperate measures. Iran and Saudi Arabia are rival oil producers but also bitter adversaries in regional politics. Short of a shooting war, tensions could hardly get any worse at this particular moment. The Saudis severed diplomatic relations with Iran in January following a mob attack on their embassy in Tehran \u2013 a protest at the execution of a leading Shia cleric, Nimr al-Nimr, in Saudi Arabia\u2019s eastern province. The two countries stand on opposite sides in the wars in Syria and Yemen \u2013 their strategic competition is interlaced with vicious sectarian hostility \u2013 adding a proxy element to an already toxic mix. Despite this unpromising geopolitical backdrop, last week there were positive moves towards an oil production deal. The price of Brent blend crude soared 7.5% on Wednesday after Bijan Zanganeh, Iran\u2019s oil minister, came out of a two-hour meeting with some of his Opec counterparts to approve a deal hatched by Saudi with non-Opec member Russia the day before. \u201cIran backs any measures which help stabilise the market and improve the price of crude oil,\u201d said Zanganeh, although, crucially, he gave no indication as to whether Iran would curtail its own production. Iran, which has the fourth-biggest oil reserves in the world, had previously trumpeted its desire to vastly expand its output following the lifting in January of western sanctions imposed over its nuclear programme. It still remains unclear exactly what will happen now: the Saudis and Russians said they would hold their output at January levels, but only if other key players \u2013 including Iran \u2013 joined in. Deals of this kind were brokered by Saudi Arabia in the 1980s only to see Russia and others renege on their commitments, forcing Riyadh to cut its output from 10 million barrels per day (bpd) to 2.5 million with little impact on prices. Last week the price of Brent blend continued to rise towards $36 per barrel following Iran\u2019s statement, although it fell back on Friday in the face of new US data showing stockpiles of oil were bigger than ever. This is still well ahead of the sub-$28 price seen last month but a long way off the $115 highs back in June 2014. Oil traders and investors see last week\u2019s developments as an increasingly hopeful sign that producers have reached their pain threshold and will do what it takes to try to force prices upwards again. However, the wider political and religious rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran is unlikely to go away any time soon. Saudi control of Mecca and the hajj pilgrimage gives it legitimacy in the Sunni Muslim world, while Iran is a beacon for Shias everywhere. Arabs and Persians have long memories of prejudice, though in modern times their animosity began with the 1979 revolution and grew after the Iraq war in 2003. More recently, Iran has deployed its own Revolutionary Guards and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, as well as Shia militiamen from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, to help keep Bashar al-Assad in power in Damascus, while the Saudis see Tehran\u2019s covert hand behind the Houthi rebels it is bombing in impoverished Yemen. Tehran routinely lambasts Riyadh as a US stooge and a sponsor or incubator of fanatical terror. But it was last year\u2019s Iranian nuclear deal that really set nerves jangling in Riyadh, fuelling fears that the decades-long US-Saudi bargain of oil for security was ending as Barack Obama leant towards Tehran. Meanwhile, the Saudi strategy over the past 18 months to pump in excess of 10 million bpd and discount its crude prices on key markets has backfired. The kingdom, Opec\u2019s biggest oil exporter, is said to need $100-a-barrel oil to cover its enormous public spending commitments. The International Monetary Fund warned recently that Riyadh would burn through all its financial reserves within five years under a $50 oil price unless it took steps to raise taxes or cut spending, which it has since started to do. In recent months the Saudis have introduced tax increases, removed fuel subsidies and even suggested they are willing to privatise at least part of its state oil company, Saudi Aramco, in clear signals of their need for cash. So far the Opec powerbroker has refused to return to its traditional role of market balancer by organising a cartel cutback in production, but the proposed deal with Russia agreed on Tuesday shows it is keen to try to break the impasse. Iran wants better prices to help power its post-sanctions economy out of recession. As recently as 2011 it was producing 3.6 million barrels a day but is now down to 2.8 million, while exports are down to 1.1 million, half the level seen before sanctions. But it has also promised more rather than less output. Following the historic sanctions-lifting deal with the US on 16 January, Tehran said it would to pump an extra half-million barrels as soon as possible. There is no doubting the scale of the oil price problem for producers, which started 18 months ago when traders woke up to the dual realisation that US shale production was going to continue rising and that Opec was no longer willing to reduce its output. The stand-off was interpreted as an unspoken determination by Saudi and other oil cartel members to keep on pumping in an attempt to drive higher-cost US drillers out of business. The strategy is certainly working \u2013 but much too slowly to avoid enormous problems building up inside the Saudi economy and in other countries almost completely dependent on oil revenues. American shale production is now almost half a million barrels a day lower than in April 2015, according to the US Department of Energy and is forecast to fall another half million this year. American production had been growing at 15% per annum when crude prices were racing along at over $100 per barrel but that growth has now stalled, despite attempts by US producers to keep going by cutting costs. Latest figures from industry specialist Baker Hughes show there are now around 540 US rigs operating \u2013 800 fewer than a year ago \u2013 while bankruptcies have risen to above numbers seen at the height of the 2008-09 banking crisis. The shale drillers need oil prices of $70 a barrel to really thrive, according to Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co, compared with around $50 for the UK North Sea and less than $6 for the likes of Saudi Arabia. The big question now is will a production freeze take hold \u2013 and, if it does, will it not just provide a fillip for the shale drillers? Traders are nervous but hopeful and Tom Nelson, head of commodities at Investec Asset Management, believes oil prices may reach $60 a barrel by the end of 2016. But opinion is polarised. Professor Paul Stevens, an energy expert at Chatham House, insists of the latest Saudi deal that \u201cnothing will come of it\u201d and predicts Brent could be anywhere between $25 and $50 by the end of 2016. He adds: \u201cThe huge \u2018fracklog\u2019 of US shale wells that have already drilled but not completed and which can quickly be brought back into operation as prices rise mean there is a ceiling of around $55 on prices for some time to come.\u201d",
