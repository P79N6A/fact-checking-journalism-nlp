      "bodyText": "Women at the top of the banking industry spur their male colleagues to take bigger risks, according to a study that undermines the widely held view of the calming influence female staff have on testosterone driven company boards. The report claims that the presence of women in senior roles across the German banking sector was a contributing factor to the banking crash, alongside the bonus culture and lack of sufficient regulation. In the study for the German central bank, the Bundesbank, the academics argue that less experienced bankers catapulted into senior roles also contributed to risky behaviour, along with directors who had not taken education far enough to gain a PhD. While the banks under review were all in Germany, with a two tier board structure, the researchers said the findings could be applicable to countries with simpler single board structures like the UK and US and should be taken seriously by policymakers. Women, they said, are a disruptive influence on previously cosy decision making of male boards. Without a homegeneous group at the top to discuss relevant issues in a relaxed atmosphere, decisions are less well informed and inherently riskier. More importantly, according to the research, the women at the banks studied were less qualified than their male counterparts, partly because they were younger on average and had reached board level with less direct business experience. The report accepts research that found women working in the loan departments of banks have a lower default rate than male staff, but say the reverse is true at senior levels, especially when they bring down the average age and levels of academic qualifications. \"One reason may be that managers without such degree may have to climb up the job ladder without the signalling advantage of a PhD degree. To reach top executive positions, they have to prove their ability by extraordinary performance which is likely to be related to higher risk taking,\" the report said.",

The move could prompt further consolidation in the sector, and this prospect has lifted <strong>Petra Diamonds</strong> 12.3p to 188.2p. Rival <strong>Gem Diamonds</strong> gained 1.1p to 286.5p while Rio rose 22p to 3386.5p and BHP slipped 2p to \u00a319.26. Ryan Long at Northland Capital Partners said:</p> <blockquote> With both BHP and Rio exiting the business it will give diamond focused miners such as Lucara Diamond Corp, Harry Winston Diamond Corporation and Petra Diamonds the opportunity to expand their asset bases or merge to create larger diamond focused miners. The other major diamond miner Gem Diamonds recently ruled itself out of the race to buy BHP's Ekati Mine and may also not be interested Rio's diamond assets. <br> </blockquote> <p>Overall, after a bright start, leading shares lost their way in the wake of data showing a dip in US consumer confidence and weak manufacturing surveys from a number of federal regions including Richmond. So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 33.15 points lower at 5869.55 after earlier rising as high as 5941.</p> <p>A number of the big falls followed companies reporting results, with building materials group <strong>Wolseley</strong> 84p lower at \u00a324.35, catering company <strong>Compass</strong> losing 17p to 651p and insurer <strong>Resolution</strong> down 6.7p at 268.2p.</p> <p>But <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> rose 0.92p to 28.67p in the wake of Monday's reports that talks were underway about selling a stake in the bailed out bank to a sovereign wealth fund in Abu Dhabi. Ian Gordon at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> It is a source of mild amusement to us that the UK government and/or UKFI didn't see 58p as a suitable selling price in August 2009 or April 2010, yet a rebound to 28p (from 17p) is allegedly the trigger for a (partial) sale of its 82% stake to Abu Dhabi in 2012. We won't hold our breath. That said, the emergence of a (potential) marginal buyer of size is welcome, and in addition to RBS' visibly improving capital and funding position, it has the capacity to act as a further source of downside protection. </blockquote> <p><strong>Barclays</strong> was 3.7p better at 251.35p after chief executive Bob Diamond told an investor conference the bank had seen an encouraging start to the year. His comments were echoed by Douglas Flint, chairman of <strong>HSBC</strong>, 3.5p higher at 564.5p.</p> <p>Broadcaster <strong>ITV</strong> continued its good run, up another 0.45p to 89.15p as Morgan Stanley became the latest to make positive comments. The bank raised its target price from 80p to 104p, saying:</p> <blockquote> We remain upbeat based on (i) favourable trends in UK TV advertising, (ii) the prospect for substantial savings (\u00a355m) in 2013 sports costs and (iii) growing appreciation of the value of ITV's content business. At 104p ITV would trade at 11.5 times 2012 earnings per share, within our 10-12 times mid cycle broadcaster range. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere Imperial Leather soap maker <strong>PZ Cussons </strong>slid 32.8p to 301.3p after its second profit warning in four months, this time due to social and economic problems in its key market of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>Drax </strong>dropped 9p to 531p despite City talk that it could attract a bidder. Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas said the coal-fired power station owner was the most likely takeover target in the sector and would fit into <strong>Centrica</strong>'s portfolio. Centrica closed down 2.2p at 317.2p.</p> <p>Other energy companies were also lower, as a continuing gas leak at one of Total's North Sea platforms brought the Gulf of Mexico disaster back into investors' minds.<strong> BP</strong> lost 10.55p to 471.35p - despite unveiling a $400m disposal - while <strong>BG</strong> fell 44p to \u00a314.75.</p> <p>Lower down the market credit card protection company <strong>CPP</strong> plunged 36% to 65.75p as its shares returned from suspension after releasing its financial results. CPP is under investigation by the Financial Services Authority - an investigation which is still continuing - and has so far set aside \u00a316.9m to cover the costs. This has left it with flat profits of \u00a346.4m. It has agreed with the FSA a number of actions to improve its sales processes, and will also conduct a review of sales of its card protection and identity protection products since 2005, including providing redress to customers where necessary. It also warned the FSA could take wider industry action, which could also have a financial impact. In any case, difficult trading conditions meant its profits for 2012 were likely to be significantly lower than in 2011.</p> <p>It is also in talks with its banks about its \u00a380m facility which expires in a year's time, and said there was a risk one or more of its existing banks may not want to participate in new lending facilities. It is currently also considering other financing options.</p> <p>Finally <strong>Premier Foods</strong> put on 1.75p to 17p after analyst Martin Deboo at Investec put a buy rating on the stock following its recent refinancing agreement:</p> <blockquote> Refinanced and with a two-year window to turn things around, the real hard work starts now. All the old doubts now re-surface, against which we take heart from new management, a convincing strategy, a slimmer portfolio, more sensible financing and some help from soft comparisons. <br> Disposals [are] critical to the equity case. A trading turnaround on its own won't de-leverage Premier fast enough, in our view. They must also achieve their covenanted level of disposals and do so at decent multiples. With a two-year window and a decent pool of disposable assets, we think this can be achieved.  The shares might still regress to 3p, but could be worth 30p. We vote for something closer to the latter, with a new 20p target price and a resumed buy recommendation.  But Premier remains a risky investment. </blockquote>",

Ryan Long at Northland Capital Partners said: With both BHP and Rio exiting the business it will give diamond focused miners such as Lucara Diamond Corp, Harry Winston Diamond Corporation and Petra Diamonds the opportunity to expand their asset bases or merge to create larger diamond focused miners. The other major diamond miner Gem Diamonds recently ruled itself out of the race to buy BHP's Ekati Mine and may also not be interested Rio's diamond assets. Overall, after a bright start, leading shares lost their way in the wake of data showing a dip in US consumer confidence and weak manufacturing surveys from a number of federal regions including Richmond. So the FTSE 100 finished 33.15 points lower at 5869.55 after earlier rising as high as 5941. A number of the big falls followed companies reporting results, with building materials group Wolseley 84p lower at \u00a324.35, catering company Compass losing 17p to 651p and insurer Resolution down 6.7p at 268.2p. But Royal Bank of Scotland rose 0.92p to 28.67p in the wake of Monday's reports that talks were underway about selling a stake in the bailed out bank to a sovereign wealth fund in Abu Dhabi. Ian Gordon at Investec said: It is a source of mild amusement to us that the UK government and/or UKFI didn't see 58p as a suitable selling price in August 2009 or April 2010, yet a rebound to 28p (from 17p) is allegedly the trigger for a (partial) sale of its 82% stake to Abu Dhabi in 2012. We won't hold our breath. That said, the emergence of a (potential) marginal buyer of size is welcome, and in addition to RBS' visibly improving capital and funding position, it has the capacity to act as a further source of downside protection. Barclays was 3.7p better at 251.35p after chief executive Bob Diamond told an investor conference the bank had seen an encouraging start to the year. His comments were echoed by Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC, 3.5p higher at 564.5p. Broadcaster ITV continued its good run, up another 0.45p to 89.15p as Morgan Stanley became the latest to make positive comments. The bank raised its target price from 80p to 104p, saying: We remain upbeat based on (i) favourable trends in UK TV advertising, (ii) the prospect for substantial savings (\u00a355m) in 2013 sports costs and (iii) growing appreciation of the value of ITV's content business. At 104p ITV would trade at 11.5 times 2012 earnings per share, within our 10-12 times mid cycle broadcaster range. Elsewhere Imperial Leather soap maker PZ Cussons slid 32.8p to 301.3p after its second profit warning in four months, this time due to social and economic problems in its key market of Nigeria. Drax dropped 9p to 531p despite City talk that it could attract a bidder. Analysts at Exane BNP Paribas said the coal-fired power station owner was the most likely takeover target in the sector and would fit into Centrica's portfolio. Centrica closed down 2.2p at 317.2p. Other energy companies were also lower, as a continuing gas leak at one of Total's North Sea platforms brought the Gulf of Mexico disaster back into investors' minds. BP lost 10.55p to 471.35p - despite unveiling a $400m disposal - while BG fell 44p to \u00a314.75. Lower down the market credit card protection company CPP plunged 36% to 65.75p as its shares returned from suspension after releasing its financial results. CPP is under investigation by the Financial Services Authority - an investigation which is still continuing - and has so far set aside \u00a316.9m to cover the costs. This has left it with flat profits of \u00a346.4m. It has agreed with the FSA a number of actions to improve its sales processes, and will also conduct a review of sales of its card protection and identity protection products since 2005, including providing redress to customers where necessary. It also warned the FSA could take wider industry action, which could also have a financial impact. In any case, difficult trading conditions meant its profits for 2012 were likely to be significantly lower than in 2011. It is also in talks with its banks about its \u00a380m facility which expires in a year's time, and said there was a risk one or more of its existing banks may not want to participate in new lending facilities. It is currently also considering other financing options. Finally Premier Foods put on 1.75p to 17p after analyst Martin Deboo at Investec put a buy rating on the stock following its recent refinancing agreement: Refinanced and with a two-year window to turn things around, the real hard work starts now. All the old doubts now re-surface, against which we take heart from new management, a convincing strategy, a slimmer portfolio, more sensible financing and some help from soft comparisons. Disposals [are] critical to the equity case. A trading turnaround on its own won't de-leverage Premier fast enough, in our view. They must also achieve their covenanted level of disposals and do so at decent multiples. With a two-year window and a decent pool of disposable assets, we think this can be achieved. The shares might still regress to 3p, but could be worth 30p. We vote for something closer to the latter, with a new 20p target price and a resumed buy recommendation. But Premier remains a risky investment.",

In its annual health check on the 17-nation single currency area, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said decisive action was needed by finance ministers when they meet later this week. The OECD's secretary general, Angel Gurr\u00eda, said the current level of funding was insufficient to restore market confidence, still fragile despite the second Greek bailout finalised earlier this month. He called for a \u20ac1tn (\u00a3835bn) war chest to contain the sovereign debt crisis, noting: \"Europe is stalling. It needs to get out of first gear and make growth the number one priority.\" The OECD warned that the debt crisis was having a knock-on impact on the UK and that the 27-nation European Union faced a tough future. \"Longer-term prospects are for growth to be weaker than over the past twenty years, influenced by population ageing and sluggish productivity gains.\" Gurr\u00eda said important advances had been made by governments in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece but the challenges remained daunting. \"Weak financial conditions, fiscal consolidation and economic adjustment are restricting demand in the short term before the long-term benefits on stability and growth are felt,\" Gurr\u00eda said. \"Decisive action to restore confidence and support demand is needed now.\" Greek officials said the country was likely to hold a snap election on 6 Mayas it must implement more austerity cuts in exchange for its \u20ac130bn bailout agreed this month. Meanwhile Ireland is to hold a referendum on the EU's new fiscal treaty on 31 May, the government said on Tuesday \u2013 which will probably be the only popular vote on plans for stricter budget discipline. The Paris-based OECD said the eurozone would slow to a virtual standstill this year, noting that there was a risk that austerity programmes and bank deleveraging would hit growth before the benefits of stronger public finances and economic reforms materialised. \"High-risk spreads and self-fulfilling expectations could lead to unsustainable debt dynamics. There is a risk of global spillovers from these developments. This calls for both short-term action and long-term reforms.\" The survey said economic, fiscal and financial imbalances in the area had led to weak banks, high unemployment and low growth. It urged an ambitious programme of reforms in product and labour markets, tax systems and education to rebalance economies, restore competitiveness, boost growth and bring down stubbornly high levels of unemployment, particularly among the young.",

It continues to appeal to consumers in countries such as the USA and France and is being enjoyed by younger professionals in newer markets in Asia and Latin America.\" Exports have increased for seven consecutive years, contributing to delivering an export-led recovery, a focus for the UK and Scottish governments. But some markets saw a decline, including Spain and South Korea. Hewitt added that securing fair market access and reducing tariffs is now a priority for the whisky industry. A free trade agreement between the European Union and South Korea came into force in July. India is a priority for this year. Hewitt said: \"We are hopeful a free trade agreement can be signed which will lead to a reduction in the onerous 150% import tariff. The industry is investing in Scotland to ensure it can seize these overseas opportunities.\" The SWA figures derive from HM Revenue &amp; Customs data. They are based on individual company declarations of the export customs value and volume of shipments to each market (which may not be the final destination of the consignment). The figures do not reflect the mark-up charged by retailers. Scotland's Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead said: \"Scotland is rightly hailed as a land of food and drink, which is underpinned by the record exports achieved in both areas in 2011. \"This demonstrates that people around the world are appreciating the high quality and delicious products that Scotland's larder has to offer. \"With exports increasing by more than a fifth, the whisky industry has seen hugely impressive year-on-year growth, while Scotland's seafood remains at the heart of our food exports offering. It's also heartening to see a substantial 60% boost in fruit and vegetable exports.\" James Withers, chief executive of Scotland Food and Drink, said: \"Our food and drink industry is Scotland's biggest growth story right now. \"These new figures mean that the 10 year target industry set itself in 2007 - to grow our total exports by 38% - has been achieved six years early. \"Whisky has been a trailblazer across the globe. But our food sector is now following its lead, with exports up a staggering 62% in just four years, as our reputation as a land of food and drink grows day-by-day.\"",

      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest pension funds have called for a radical overhaul of boardroom pay in an effort to end the \"jackpot\" payouts to top bosses. The pension funds, led by the influential Hermes Equity Ownership Services, are calling for an end to three-year bonuses linked to earnings per share and a replacement of these long-term incentive plans by a simple method of cash bonuses and awards of shares that must be held for the longer term. Colin Melvin, chief executive of Hermes EOS, which is owned by Britain's largest occupational pension fund at BT, said the reform was needed because \"we are at a moment of crisis in the evolution of publicly listed companies and their relationship with their shareholders, with a poor economic backdrop and minimal growth intensifying the need for reform\". He said the complexity of boardroom pay meant that when executives received bonuses based on earning per shares over three years they regarded it as \"like winning the jackpot\" even though their pay deals were so complex that it was not obvious what targets they had to hit to achieve the payouts. Hermes EOS and the National Association of Pension Funds discussed the ideas for changes at a meeting last month with remuneration committee chairmen from almost half the companies in the FTSE 100. David Paterson, head of corporate governance at the NAPF, will now set up a high-level working group of pension fund investors and remuneration committee members to devise ways to better link pay to performance that are expected to be based on the Hermes EOS ideas. Hermes EOS is publishing its discussion paper at the same time that business secretary Vince Cable \u2013 who attended the meeting last month \u2013 is consulting on how to hand investors a binding vote on pay, in addition to the current vote on remuneration reports which has been in place since 2004. Cable's department discussed the consultation with investors on Monday. Hermes EOS warned that a binding vote could have \"significant unintended consequences\" by making shareholders less likely to vote. Melvin acknowledged that ideas set out by Hermes did not directly address the exact period that pay should be measured over or how much directors should receive. \"We do need to [resolve] \u2026 how much is too much and how long is long term,\" said Melvin. He said there was a need to narrow the gap between top and average pay, and called for an end to the practice where the average annual boardroom rise was up to 8%, compared with 2% for those outside, suggesting executives could take pay rises in shares. The main beneficiaries of complexity in executive pay are the remuneration consultants which design the schemes, he said, as he called for a vote on the appointment on consultants to match the way auditors must be approved by shareholders at annual meetings.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Cost of stamps rises as Royal Mail gets new price-setting powers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Royal Mail has hiked the cost of a first-class stamp by 14p to 60p, the biggest price rise for 37 years, in a move that pushes the organisation closer to privatisation and has triggered concerns over the impact on small businesses and elderly people. Second-class prices also rose 14p to 50p in a package of increases announced immediately after the Royal Mail's regulator, Ofcom, warned that an explosion in text messages, emails and Facebook sign-ups over the past decade was threatening the postal network's financial viability. The Royal Mail's chief executive, Moya Greene, said the state-owned business had no choice but to ramp up first-class prices by 30% and second-class by 39%, having seen its mail collection and delivery unit lose nearly \u00a31bn in four years. Mail volumes have slumped by a quarter since 2006 to 59m letters and parcels a day. \"We know how hard it is for households and businesses when our economy is as tough as it is now,\" said Greene. \"No one likes to raise prices in the current economic climate but, regretfully, we have no option.\" The price rises come into effect at the end of the month. The Greeting Card Association said fewer envelopes could be hitting doormats next Christmas. \"We think this could affect Christmas quite dramatically,\" said the GCA's chief executive, Sharon Little. Ofcom paved the way for the price hikes on Tuesday morning by unveiling a new pricing regime for the Royal Mail, which could be sold or partially floated by the government next autumn. First-class prices will no longer be set by the regulator, Ofcom said, although it introduced a seven-year price cap of 55p for second-class stamps, index-linked to the consumer price index rate of inflation. The government hopes would-be buyers of the Royal Mail will be more interested in the business once it shows signs of turning a profit, aided by higher stamp income. Greene said \"all the necessary big steps\" had been taken before a full or partial selloff in two years' time, with some analysts valuing the Royal Mail at \u00a34bn. \"I do not think it impossible we can be in a deal mode in 2013. Personally I think it is more likely to be the first quarter of 2014,\" said Greene. The Post Office network will remain under state ownership. The communications watchdog lifted price caps on first-class stamps after it admitted that the digital boom was making a universal postal service financially untenable. The cost of posting large letters will also increase from 75p to 90p for first-class and from 58p to 69p for second-class, while discounted stamps will be offered to some low-income houses this Christmas. Ofcom's director of competition, Stuart McIntosh, said the deregulation of first-class stamps was necessary to guarantee the universal postal service provision, a Brussels-enforced mandate that requires the delivery of a postal service to any address in the country six days a week. \"The mail services that we have benefited from over decades and centuries are fundamentally at risk.\" He said competition from mobile phones, email and other postal providers such as TNT Post UK would help prevent the Royal Mail from abusing deregulation, while the second-class stamp ceiling would also hold down first-class tariffs. \"If they set the price very high relative to second-class stamps many people will move from first to second class. This is a constraint on their ability to raise their prices. Also, if they increase their prices it will make the services of competitors more attractive.\" Prior to Tuesday's announcement, the biggest price increases were in 1975 when first and second class costs rose by 55% and 58% respectively. The Royal Mail will go through a series of symbolic changes this weekend, formally separating from the Post Office network and handing its \u00a39.5bn pension deficit to the state. Both moves, along with price deregulation, pave the way for a flotation. In the Post Office network's rural heartlands, there was dismay. In Chipping Sodbury, 79-year-old June Kent popped her three neatly addressed envelopes into the red box outside the post office and bemoaned the price rise. \"I'm horrified,\" she said. \"I use email more than the post now but I still like to send and receive letters. I shall have to think twice now every time I send a letter. It seems such a lot of money, especially as I can remember when a stamp was tuppence ha'penny.\" Her friend, a garden designer, Jill Fenwick, arrived at the bustling post office in south Gloucestershire to stockpile 30 first and 30 second-class stamps. \"That should last me to Christmas. By then I'll have forgotten about the increase,\" she said. But Fenwick does feel the price hike will have a lasting impact. \"It's going to affect the poor old ladies when they come to send their birthday or Christmas cards. Will it mean the post offices close down and the greetings card people seeing their profits drop? It seems very sad.\" Gillian Whitfield, who has just sent a letter off to her son, said she would aim to start sending only second-class letters. \"I use -mail a lot but you have to use stamps for Christmas and birthday cards. I'll have to be really organised.\" The shadow postal affairs minister, Ian Murray, said the price increase would hit millions of people, including the elderly, small businesses and charities. According to Ofcom, households spend 50p a week on postal services. However, businesses, charities and government departments are the Royal Mail's most important customers. Social mail, from Christmas cards to wedding invitations, makes up less than 10% of its business and most of its revenue comes from companies such as banks and utility groups sending bills, statements and marketing material. The Forum of Private Business said the price increases would damage small businesses. Ofcom has also deregulated the prices that Royal Mail charges the likes of TNT Post UK, which sends the bills for the likes of BT and British Gas via Royal Mail depots and delivery staff, but the regulator warned that it will watch out for unfair prices. The Communication Workers Union, which represents 160,000 Royal Mail staff, said the increases were the inevitable consequence of the move towards privatisation. Billy Hayes, general secretary of the union, said: \"Those people who balk at the idea of stamp price rises should understand that it comes directly from government decisions to privatise this industry \u2013 just as we've seen massive price increases in train travel under privatisation.\" The department for business said: \"Price rises are never welcome. However, ministers are clear that the top priority is to protect the universal service on which people rely.\"",

Mail volumes have slumped by a quarter since 2006 to 59m letters and parcels a day.</p> <p>\"We know how hard it is for households and businesses when our economy is as tough as it is now,\" said Greene. \"No one likes to raise prices in the current economic climate but, regretfully, we have no option.\" The price rises come into effect at the end of the month.</p> <p>The Greeting Card Association said fewer envelopes could be hitting doormats next Christmas. \"We think this could affect Christmas quite dramatically,\" said the GCA's chief executive, Sharon Little.</p> <p>Ofcom paved the way for the price hikes on Tuesday morning by unveiling a new pricing regime for the Royal Mail, which could be sold or partially floated by the government next autumn. First-class prices will no longer be set by the regulator, Ofcom said, although it introduced a seven-year price cap of 55p for second-class stamps, index-linked to the consumer price index rate of inflation.</p> <p>The government hopes would-be buyers of the Royal Mail will be more interested in the business once it shows signs of turning a profit, aided by higher stamp income. Greene said \"all the necessary big steps\" had been taken before a full or partial selloff in two years' time, with some analysts valuing the Royal Mail at \u00a34bn.</p> <p>\"I do not think it impossible we can be in a deal mode in 2013. Personally I think it is more likely to be the first quarter of 2014,\" said Greene. The Post Office network will remain under state ownership.</p> <p>The communications watchdog lifted price caps on first-class stamps after it admitted that the digital boom was making a universal postal service financially untenable. The cost of posting large letters will also increase from 75p to 90p for first-class and from 58p to 69p for second-class, while discounted stamps will be offered to some low-income houses this Christmas.</p> <p>Ofcom's director of competition, Stuart McIntosh, said the deregulation of first-class stamps was necessary to guarantee the universal postal service provision, a Brussels-enforced mandate that requires the delivery of a postal service to any address in the country six days a week. \"The mail services that we have benefited from over decades and centuries are fundamentally at risk.\"</p> <p>He said competition from mobile phones, email and other postal providers such as TNT Post UK would help prevent the Royal Mail from abusing deregulation, while the second-class stamp ceiling would also hold down first-class tariffs. \"If they set the price very high relative to second-class stamps many people will move from first to second class. This is a constraint on their ability to raise their prices. Also, if they increase their prices it will make the services of competitors more attractive.\"</p> <p>Prior to Tuesday's announcement, the biggest price increases were in 1975 when first and second class costs rose by 55% and 58% respectively.</p> <p>The Royal Mail will go through a series of symbolic changes this weekend, formally separating from the Post Office network and handing its \u00a39.5bn pension deficit to the state. Both moves, along with price deregulation, pave the way for a flotation.</p> <p>In the Post Office network's rural heartlands, there was dismay. In Chipping Sodbury, 79-year-old June Kent popped her three neatly addressed envelopes into the red box outside the post office and bemoaned the price rise. \"I'm horrified,\" she said. \"I use email more than the post now but I still like to send and receive letters. I shall have to think twice now every time I send a letter. It seems such a lot of money, especially as I can remember when a stamp was tuppence ha'penny.\"</p> <p>Her friend, a garden designer, Jill Fenwick, arrived at the bustling post office in south Gloucestershire to stockpile 30 first and 30 second-class stamps. \"That should last me to Christmas. By then I'll have forgotten about the increase,\" she said.</p> <p>But Fenwick does feel the price hike will have a lasting impact. \"It's going to affect the poor old ladies when they come to send their birthday or Christmas cards. Will it mean the post offices close down and the greetings card people seeing their profits drop? It seems very sad.\" Gillian Whitfield, who has just sent a letter off to her son, said she would aim to start sending only second-class letters. \"I use -mail a lot but you have to use stamps for Christmas and birthday cards. I'll have to be really organised.\"</p> <p>The shadow postal affairs minister, Ian Murray, said the price increase would hit millions of people, including the elderly, small businesses and charities.
