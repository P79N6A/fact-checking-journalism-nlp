    "webTitle": "Miliband stands firm in battle over fuel bills plan", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares in two leading energy firms fell sharply on Wednesday as Ed Miliband stood firm over his plan to impose a 20-month energy price freeze if elected in 2015 pending an industry reorganisation designed to inject greater competition and transparency. Centrica, the energy company that responded most aggressively to Miliband's speech on Tuesday announcing the freeze, fell 5.37 % while SSN shares fell 5.76%. Shares in other firms were steady. Energy UK representing the energy sector sent a letter to Miliband seeking an urgent meeting. Earlier on Wednesday, the Labour leader told energy companies: \"We can work together on the basis of this price freeze. \u2026 Or you can reinforce in the public mind that you are part of the problem not the solution.\" Miliband also signalled that he was determined not to lose momentum in the wake of the party conference speech, admitting that such a loss had occurred last year in the wake of his One Nation speech. He disclosed that he had asked his party to mount a major doorstep campaign on energy prices, including a film targeted at the hundreds of thousands of swing voters whom the party has identified on Facebook. Labour pointed to YouGov polling showing that the price of energy is the single biggest factor in voters' concerns over living standards. The tracking polling shows that 83% feel energy suppliers maximise profits at expense of customers and 91% expect energy prices to rise over next 12 months. More than half (56%) agree with the statement \"energy companies treat people with contempt\". The Conservatives said the policy was unravelling after Miliband said he would revisit it if wholesale prices rose sharply during the period of the price freeze. They also said David Cameron had acted on energy prices by requiring that people are offered the lowest tariff. Labour said the coalition had not yet spelled out which consumer groups would receive the lowest tariff offer \u2013 almost a year after Cameron made the pledge. Asked how he would respond if energy companies put prices up before his freeze was implemented, Miliband said: \"I'm not going to tolerate the energy companies using the fact that there's going to be a price freeze to somehow collude in raising prices before the election. \"We are going to make this a meaningful freeze. We will make sure we do that.\" In his letter, he told the energy companies: \"You and I know that the public have lost faith in this market. There is a crisis of confidence. \"We face a stark choice. We can work together on the basis of this price freeze to make the market work in the future. Or you can reinforce in the public mind that you are part of the problem not the solution.\" The Labour leader also started to liken the confrontation with the energy firms to the battle Labour waged against excess bank profits in the late 1990s. He warned: \"We will have scare stories from the energy companies, like we had scare stories from the banks \u2013 threats, scare stories about regulation. I'm not going to tolerate that. \"The Conservative party will support them, but I'm in a different place. I'm standing up for the British people.\" The response of some City energy experts was scathing, with one claiming that Labour had implicitly abandoned its commitment to the 2020 renewable energy target and probably its 2030 greenhouse gas reduction goals with its plans for an energy price freeze. Peter Atherton, head of utilities research at Liberum Capital, said: \"We assume that Labour could not be so staggeringly naive/stupid/misinformed as to believe that an arbitrary price cap is compatible with the threefold (\u00a3100bn plus) increase in investment required from next year to hit the renewable target. \"Therefore we can only conclude that Labour have now abandoned their environmental targets.\" He said a \"crisis in policy\" had been triggered and urged Centrica, the owner of British Gas, to switch its spending away from Britain. Other investment houses such as JP Morgan and Credit Suisse described the Labour moves as detrimental and very concerning. But on Wednesday Angela Knight, chief executive of the power employers group, Energy-UK, struck a more conciliatory note, saying she had written to Miliband asking for a private meeting as soon as possible to discuss the proposed policy changes. \"I have said we need to get together and put the facts and issues on the table. We need to share numbers and really get to the bottom of what they are proposing. We need to look at all the choices and all the consequences. The fact is that 20% of a customer bill is transmission and distribution, 20% the green and social levy and another big chunk rising wholesale gas costs over which we have not control. But 'hang on' \u2013 we are being told we need to hold the price of a bill down. We need to talk about this.\"Many of the big six companies have been heavily criticised and fined for a raft of abuses such as doorstep mis-selling but Jo Butlin, the managing director of energy consultancy Utilyx, agreed that they were often unfairly blamed for many rising costs for which they were not responsible. But she admitted they had not helped themselves: \"I do not believe that the suppliers are evil profiteers but they have muddied the debate (over rising costs) by scoring lots of own goals.\"",

On 18 April 2007, Broker 3 emailed Broker 2, stating: \u201c<em>With [UBS] how much does [Trader A] appreciate the yen libor scoop? It seems to me that he has all his glory etc and u guys get his support in other things. I get the drib and drabs.</em>\u201d In that email, Broker 3 then requested \u201c<em>some form of performance&#xa0;bonus per quarter from your . . . bonus pool to me for the libor service.</em>\u201d </p> <p>ii. The following day, Broker 3 sent another email to Broker 2 threatening \u201cLIBORS NO MORE,\u201d if he did not receive sufficient compensation. Broker 3 added that \u201c<em>As far as I was concerned&#xa0;[Trader A] was paying for the libor assist for my assistance</em>\u201d and that were he not to be compensated properly, there would be&#xa0;\u201c<em>no more mr libor.</em>\u201d</p> <p>Because Brokers 1 and 2 believed that Broker 3 was critical to the&#xa0;success of the scheme, they agreed (with Trader A\u2019s support) to pay him&#xa0;a \u201cLIBOR services\u201d bonus or \u201cfixing service\u201d bonus as a reward. The&#xa0;bonus money was derived from UBS\u2019s brokerage commission and was&#xa0;allocated to Broker 3 out of the JPY Derivatives Desk\u2019s bonus pool. From&#xa0;June 2007 to September 2009, Broker 3 received \u00a350,000 (\u00a35,000 per&#xa0;quarter) in bonus payments, which the three Brokers knew to be corrupt.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5242e213e4b025976cb65c1b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-25T13:21:26.392Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The activities for which ICAP has been fined occured between July 2006 and January&#xa0;2011.</p> <p>For much of that time, chief executive Michael Spencer was also serving as Conservative party treasurer, as Channel 4's Faisal Islam flags up:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/statuses/382850153734217728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Libor manipulation help 06-10 coincided with the time that boss Michael Spencer was Conservative Treasurer.. <a href=\"http://t.co/phZPgestCC\">http://t.co/phZPgestCC</a></p>&mdash; Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/statuses/382850153734217728\">September 25, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-09-25T13:59:55.716Z\">at 2.59pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5242e0fae4b090a5419bf8ed\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-09-25T13:16:03.221Z\">2.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">&quot;Lord Libor&quot;</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The DoJ claims that Colin Goodman, who worked as&#xa0;a cash broker at ICAP\u2019s London office, was known as \"Lord Libor\" by colleagues, and also used the term himself.</strong></p> <p>Here's the basis of the DoJ's case:&#xa0;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In addition to brokering cash transactions, Goodman distributed a daily email to individuals outside of ICAP, including derivatives traders at several large banks as well as those responsible for providing the BBA with LIBOR submissions at certain banks.

But economists are split on the merits of cutting spending now.</p> <p>While the move would in principle be welcome in a country where public spending makes up 57 percent of gross domestic product, it will hurt growth in the short term, just as the country is emerging from recession and with unemployment at 11 percent. The modest tax increases, meanwhile, are eliciting grumbles in France, which already has one of the highest tax burdens in the world.</p> <p>The <strong>budget</strong> appears to be Paris' belated effort to fall in line with the rest of Europe's focus on reducing public debts.</p> <p>The slow approach is typical of Francois Hollande's tenure. The <strong>French</strong> president is famous for trying not to be famous. His most notable domestic policy so far, the creation of a 75 percent income tax, was rejected by a court and amended so many times that it lost much of its shock value. His reforms have been painstakingly negotiated and have often lost much of their punch by the time they are announced.</p> </blockquote> <p>And the EU's reaction to the budget will also be interesting.

This is reflected in the increase in economic expectations, which are on a clear upward trend. Germans' desire to shop also&#xa0;appears to be unbroken.</p> <p>In fact, willingness to buy once again improved on&#xa0;the record value of the previous month. However, income expectations&#xa0;declined for the second consecutive time, but continue to be at an extremely high level.</p> </blockquote> <p>GfK also reported that the eurozone's record low interest rates are making Germans desperate to spend:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the fall in income expectations, consumers are almost euphoric when it comes to their propensity to consume. Now is perceived as a good time to make major purchases.</p> </blockquote> <p>Europe's debt woes, though, still loom over Germany.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It cannot be ruled out that respondents were influenced&#xa0;by the German parliamentary election for the Bundestag, which had not yet&#xa0;taken place at the time of the survey.

And here's one more photo from tonight's protest, from the city of Chania in Crete: Over in Athens, our correspondent Helena Smith reports that Syntagma Square is deserted -- partly because authorities made it extremely hard for protestors to reach it. (see next post for photo -- minor technical glitch there) A senior official in Athens told Helena that turnout for the protest at Syntagma itself was \"much smaller than expected. I would put it at several thousand but certainly not more than 5,000. We're all saying how disappointed we are and are attributing it to the fact that it was organised so suddenly and in very little time.\" With the general strike closing down metro stations in Athens it was also difficult to get to the city centre, Helena explained, adding: No tear gas has been fired in Syntagma Square where crowds have gathered outside the parliament building. But away from Syntagma, the crowds are still massing massed, as these latest photos from Twitter show. One is in the city of Thessaloniki: And why is the UK Treasury fighting Europe's bonus caps?... Heather Stewart explains: Back on ICAP's Libor settlement, and the Labour Party is piling more pressure on the government over the donations made by Michael Spencer in recent years Michael Dugher MP, Labour\u2019s Vice-Chair, issued a statement claiming that prime minister David Cameron had tried to prevent a full inquiry into Libor rate-rigging: Heres's the full quote from the statement: David Cameron is a Prime Minister who stands up for the privileged few rather than ordinary people. He fought tooth and nail to avoid launching a proper inquiry into the scandal of rigging interest rates, the very scandal which has now engulfed one of his big donors - a man who has given him nearly \u00a35m. The Tories should now return this money. On the very same day George Osborne\u2019s top priority has been to argue against plans for a cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses, taking a case to the European Court of Justice. It just goes to show what we already knew. In the end it\u2019s a privileged few whose voices he hears, and whose interests he acts in. And if you missed the George Osborne story -- the chancellor is taking Europe's plan to restrict bankers' bonuses at 100% of basis salary to court. Osborne Takes Legal Action Over EU Bonus Cap Another photo from Greece, showing protestors throwing rocks at riot police, who fired teargas back: Greek police have reportedly fired teargas at demonstrators who threw stones at them during tonight's protests. Reuters reported: Greek police fired teargas at dozens of demonstrators pelting them with stones and bottles in Athens on Wednesday during a protest against the far-right Golden Dawn party, a Reuters witness said. Thousands of Greeks marched to the party's headquarters some 5 km (miles) from the city centre in the biggest show of public anger at the killing of an anti-racism rapper by a Golden Dawn sympathiser. And it looks like the Greek riot police are blocking anti-fascist marchers from getting to Golden Dawn's Athens HQ: Sounds like those Greek demonstrators are taking their message to Golden Dawn's offices: Greece's eKathimerini newspaper is reporting tonight that police probe into the party has widened. Supreme Court deputy prosecutor Charalambos Vourliotis on Wednesday reportedly ordered restrictions to be lifted on the telephone records of officials and lawmakers of the ultra-right Golden Dawn as an investigation into the criminal activities of the party widens. According to sources, judicial authorities who are conducting the investigation in coordination with the National Intelligence Service (EYP) already have evidence that incriminates officials and deputies of the party and could lead to the detention of several suspects on charges of membership of a criminal organization. At least three active members of Golden Dawn are to offer testimony about the party\u2019s activities in the coming days, Kathimerini understands. They have reportedly come under extreme pressure by party officials not to speak to the judiciary and so their testimonies are likely to be made at a secret location, not at court facilities. More here: Probe extends to top echeleons of Golden Dawn Back on Libor, and the Telegraph have pulled together the conversations between brokers and traders during the rate-rigging scandal. Back in the eurozone crisis, a big anti fascist rally is underway in Greece tonight. Those on the scene report a huge turnout, as popular anger over the rise of the Golden Dawn party hits the streets. These photos from Twitter prove it: As I flagged up earlier (see 10.23am), support for the party has slumped since the death of anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas last week. Elsewhere in the stock market, shares in Centrica and SSE both tumbled over 5% as the row over energy price freezes rumbled on. That wipes around \u00a31bn off Centrica's market capitalisation, and another \u00a3800m+ off SSE, as both utility firms suffered from Ed Miliband's pledge to freeze prices for 20 months if he become prime minister in 2015. Centrica has already claimed that price controls could make it uneconomical to run its service. Today's share price falls may reflect predictions that the government will be bounced into its own clampdown. ICAP shares fell this afternoon as the Libor settlement unfolded, finishing down 1.8% at 389p, down 7.3p. They actually rose after the \u00a355m fines were announced -- earlier press reports had suggested it could be as much as \u00a370m. But traders may be reacting to the downbeat trading statement that ICAP also put out, warning that trading eased off in July \"followed by a more significant decline in August\". Labour MP John Mann has now written to David Cameron, calling on him to hand over the donations he has received from former Conservative party treasurer Michael Spencer. Mann wants the prime minister to hand the money (\u00a34.6m by his count) to Armed Forces charities . They already benefitting from the Libor fines levied on City firms through the \"The armed forces covenant (Libor) fund\". Mann argued: Michael Spencer\u2019s donations of over \u00a34.6m to the Conservative Party got him access to the Prime Minister at Chequers in 2010. Now his firm ICAP has been fined for fixing the Libor rates. Previous UK Libor fines have been transferred to the Armed Forces Covenant Fund, and then donated to Armed forces charities. In line with this Government policy, today I have called on David Cameron to immediately confirm that he will ensure that all previous donations from Michael Spencer and his company go to Armed forces charities. Mann also tweeted that this is the 'biggest party donor scandal ever' The Labour Party has calculated that ICAP chief executive Michael Spencer had donated almost \u00a35m to the Conservative Party, and it's calling for it to be returned. fastFT has the story: The FT's Jim Pickard and Elizabeth Rigby say Labour is pressing the Tories to pay back donations from Michael Spencer, ICAP's founder, who is a longtime supporter of the party and was even its co-treasurer between 2006 and 2010. A senior Labour source said: \"If David Cameron doesn't immediately pay back the \u00a34.8m Michael Spencer gave the Tories, he will be showing yet again that he cares more about standing up for a privileged few than about families and businesses facing a cost of living crisis.\" The timing of ICAP's reprimand and huge fine at the hands of regulators over Libor manipulation could not have come at a worse time \u2013 just three days before the opening of the Conservative party's annual conference. Mr Spencer is close to many senior Tory figures, having donated a total of \u00a34.8m either in person or through his holding company IPGL Ltd. Quite a lively press call, there, particularly when the focus turned onto Michael Spencer himself. But what are the key points? \u2022 ICAP didn't know that Libor rigging was happening on its watch until 2011. Spencer explained that the bank only realised what was occuring when regulators came and told them, after a probe at UBS. That suggests a major failure of internal controls -- the rigging had begun five years earlier. \u2022 Senior managers are being hit in the pocket. Spencer said that compensation would be \"impacted considerably\" &lt;- City speak for smaller bonuses. However, Spencer didn't say that he will personally hand back any bonus for 2013. \u2022 City culture is back in the dock. Another Libor scandal means another collection of embarrassing messages, painting a grim picture of kickbacks and arrogance. Michael Spencer insisted that he, and the vast majority of staff, are shocked by the affair and determined to avoid a repeat. But today's headlines will be a reminder of just how badly things went wrong. \u2022 Spencer is squarely in the spotlight. As a species, chief executives don't like being criticised. But Spencer founded ICAP, so must be responsible for the culture of the firm. He played the bad apple card- arguing that the man at the top can't be help responsible for every failing within a large company. But the fact he was also acting as Conservative Party Treasurer while a small group of his employees were rigging the yen Libor rate must hurt. \u2022 The political angle. Spencer was perfectly civil when he suggested reporters check the official records to find his donations to the Conservatives. But I don't think he liked it being raised, at all. There's going to be pressure on David Cameron over the money donated over the years... Final question -- apparently the Labour Party has already issued a statement, saying that ICAP's Libor fine is an embarrassment to the government, because Michael Spencer has donated money in the past. Does he have any view on the suggestion that the Conservatives should repay the money? And is he still a Conservative Party donor? Spencer says that he can't speak for David Cameron, or other senior party members. And his donations are a matter of public record -- you'll have to check the details yourself. And that's the end of the press call. Spencer also concedes that it was a mistake for the trading desk at the heart of the Yen Libor rigging to not be audited during the time the activities took place. ICAP has beefed up its compliance department since -- it's now 50-people strong, and the firm is spending \u00a317m per year on it. Spencer fields another question about his decision not to resign. He insists that he is committed to avoid any repeat of the Libor scandal, saying: I bear this responsibly very very profoundly. And asked about the culture at ICAP, he insists \"I promise I care a hell of a lot\", and insisting that the vast majority of people at the company are \"bitterly angry\" and \"shocked\" about what happened. Why is Michael Spencer different from Barclays' Bob Diamond, or RBS's John Hourican, who both resigned over their banks' involvement in the Libor scandal, asks Harry Wilson of the Telegraph. Spencer says he doesn't believe this case is comparable. He adds that ICAP have spoken to its top shareholders today -- the implication being that he still has their support. Juliet Samuel of The Times asks why ICAP has not clawed back bonuses from those at the heart of the scandal. Spencer explains the main reason is that the three people at the heart of the Libor-rigging are now being prosecuted by the DoJ. And the bad apple line come up -- this involved more than a few people, across several banks. Spencer says that \" like you, I share a real sense of disappointment over this.\" Regulators are, rightly, taking this very seriously. He welcomes that, and says he believes that the markets at the heart of this will be \"cleaner, more professional....and fit for purpose\". Does Spencer regret handing the Labour Party a weapon to beat the government with, asks the FT's Jonathan Guthrie. Spencer declines to answer it. Is ICAP providing any financial help to the traders who have been dismissed? No, Spencer replies. Spencer also reveals that mobile phones have been banned on the ICAP trading floor, to prevent a repeat fo the Libor scandal. Next question - has Michael Spencer considered his position? He says he's considered \"many things\" but considered that it would be \"very dangerous\" if the head is responsible for activity he didn't know about, especially in a big company. But isn't this an issue of company culture? Spencer replies that it's a \"rotten apple\" issue, and believes he is the best man to lead the company. My colleague Jill Treanor asks Michael Spencer whether the fact he was working as Conservative party treasurer was a factor in the libor rate-rigging. He denies it. Spencer explains that he didn't know any of the people involved this episode, and \"I don't believe that if I'd been here more I would have picked it up.\" Spencer also argues that very few people would have even thought there could be a \"concert party effort\" to manipulate Libor. At the time, many people thought it was unmanipulatable. Spencer also denies suggesting that Libor wasn't a big deal, but says the firm didn't know about it until the regulators discovered problems at UBS. And Duncan Wales reveals that ICAP has probed 12 million documents, and is examining another 40 million, in its search for evidence. The FT asks what ICAP have done to clean up its systems, and why they weren't strong enough at the time. Michael Spencer replies that while ICAP had instigated tough systems, it did not \" invisige a very carefully concealed collaboration between traders and a banker\". In the end, every firm is at risk to \"rogue conduct\". David Enrich of the Wall Street Journal questions how senior managers could not be culpable, given that the financial inducements paid to UBS traders was signed off by certain senior managers. Duncan Wales, ICAP's group general counsel, replies that there was a difference between what the managers knew was going on, and what the individuals knew was going on. Wales also explains that ICAP's internal procedures don't allow individual traders to sign off such payments to other banks, in an attempt to stop malpractice. How could the traders sound so relaxed about fixing Libor? Spencer replies that people showed a \"cavalier disregard\" for the rules, in what was a \"profoundly regrettable period\". Questions. City AM goes first. Will Michael Spencer lose out personally? \"The answer is yes\", Spencer replies. Although he doesn't set his own bonus, there is no doubt that the compensation for senior managers, and those in the relevant trading divisions, will be affected Our compensation will be impacted considerably. In conclusion, Spencer says, this has been a difficult period for the company, but one we can move on from. We will harden our compliance, and continue to offer clients the service they expect. Michael Spencer, CEO of ICAP, is hosting the call with senior managers. He's starting by outlining today's news -- basically repeating the statement announced earlier. Spencer says he deeply regrets the actions of those responsible, calling it 'deeply wrong' . He also takes some comfort that senior managers have not been implicated. ICAP is holding a press call to discuss its settlement with the FCA and the CFTC over Libor. It's just starting.... I'm dialled in, so will blog some highlights Here's an example of how the financial inducements were discussed: Cash Broker 1: Hi [Yen Desk Head] with ubs how much does he appreciate the yen libor scoop? It seems to me that he has all his glory etc and u guys get his support in other things. I get the drib and drabs. Life is tough enough over here without having to double guess the libors every morning and get zipper-de-do-da. How about some form of performance bonus per quarter from your b bonus pool to me for the libor service *** Yen Desk Head: Lord Baliff, I would suggest a lunch over golden week.Monday or Tuesday if you are around. *** As for kick backs etc we can discuss that at lunch and I will speak to [Senior Yen Trader] about it next time he comes up for a chat. Felix Salmon flags up another exchange: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has also released details of the email exchanges between brokers and dealers as they fixed the Yen libor rate. They're online here. They show that at least one ICAP broker referred to the panel bank submitters as \u201csheep\u201d, as they sent out inaccurate suggested LIBOR rates which they hoped would be copied. They also show that Yen brokers had begun by offering each other the promise of food and drink: For example, in October 2006, Derivatives Broker 1 sent this message: Morning Lad [Cash Broker 1], On the scrounge again, if possible keep 3m [3 month Libor fix] the same and get 6mos [six-month Libor] as high as you can. My guy has an enormous fix on Wednesday in 6mos and will want it as high as possible. Waiting for my credit card to get returned to me from a drunken night out bowling, but will be supplying you with copious amounts of curry on it's imminent return. Cheers By February 2008, a Ferrari was being promised: Derivatives Broker 1: If u can pls move 3m up more than 6m wud be much appreciated :-P Cash Broker 1: What happens if they go down. 3m looked higher yesterday pm and 6m no change Derivatives Broker 1: Make 6m go lower! They r going up. [Senior Yen Trader] will buy you a ferrari next yr if you move 3m up and no change 6m Cash Broker 1: Not bad isuppose 9625 against 01625 The transcripts also showed that tensions had grown between traders once the financial crisis blew up: Here's an example: Senior Yen Trader: that 6m was a disaster for me i need [Cash Broker 1] to try and get those who didn't move Derivatives Broker 1: he has already gone round some of the fixers questioning their sets....i spoke to him late last night. He has chased them and cannot understand their motives .Its not even the rbs and [Bank D\u2019s] of the world that fcked us he has no influence on Bank C, would have spoken to [Bank H] but the guy is pretty stuborn and reckons he's always right. Senior Yen Trader: [Bank C] [Yen Broker at Broker B] is talking to i reckon i maybe able to get another favour from [Bank G Yen LIBOR Submitter] oh well you can't win em all i guess the problem was the fall immediately before the turn Derivatives Broker 1: ok [Cash Broker 1] has spoken with [Bank H] and [Bank E] not sure about [Bank B] Senior Yen Trader: yeah [Bank B] is one that can really help The FCA's final judgement against ICAP (click here for a pdf) contains some fascinating colour about how the Libor rate was fixed. That includes the revelation that one broker involved in the scheme received bonus payments of \u00a35,000 per quarter, worth a total of \u00a350,000. Here's a flavour: i. On 18 April 2007, Broker 3 emailed Broker 2, stating: \u201cWith [UBS] how much does [Trader A] appreciate the yen libor scoop? It seems to me that he has all his glory etc and u guys get his support in other things. I get the drib and drabs.\u201d In that email, Broker 3 then requested \u201csome form of performance bonus per quarter from your . . . bonus pool to me for the libor service.\u201d ii. The following day, Broker 3 sent another email to Broker 2 threatening \u201cLIBORS NO MORE,\u201d if he did not receive sufficient compensation. Broker 3 added that \u201cAs far as I was concerned [Trader A] was paying for the libor assist for my assistance\u201d and that were he not to be compensated properly, there would be \u201cno more mr libor.\u201d Because Brokers 1 and 2 believed that Broker 3 was critical to the success of the scheme, they agreed (with Trader A\u2019s support) to pay him a \u201cLIBOR services\u201d bonus or \u201cfixing service\u201d bonus as a reward. The bonus money was derived from UBS\u2019s brokerage commission and was allocated to Broker 3 out of the JPY Derivatives Desk\u2019s bonus pool. From June 2007 to September 2009, Broker 3 received \u00a350,000 (\u00a35,000 per quarter) in bonus payments, which the three Brokers knew to be corrupt. The activities for which ICAP has been fined occured between July 2006 and January 2011. For much of that time, chief executive Michael Spencer was also serving as Conservative party treasurer, as Channel 4's Faisal Islam flags up: The DoJ claims that Colin Goodman, who worked as a cash broker at ICAP\u2019s London office, was known as \"Lord Libor\" by colleagues, and also used the term himself. Here's the basis of the DoJ's case: In addition to brokering cash transactions, Goodman distributed a daily email to individuals outside of ICAP, including derivatives traders at several large banks as well as those responsible for providing the BBA with LIBOR submissions at certain banks. Goodman\u2019s email contained what was termed his \u201cSUGGESTED LIBORS,\u201d purported predictions of where Yen LIBOR ultimately would fix each day across eight specified borrowing periods. Read and Wilkinson, along with Goodman himself, often referred to Goodman as \u201clord libor.\u201d The complaint alleges that Read, Wilkinson and Goodman, together with UBS Trader, executed a sustained and systematic scheme to move Yen LIBOR in a direction favorable to UBS Trader\u2019s trading positions. According to the criminal complaint, the primary strategy employed by Read, Wilkinson and Goodman to execute the scheme was to use Goodman\u2019s \u201cSUGGESTED LIBORS\u201d email to disseminate misinformation to Yen LIBOR panel banks in hopes that the banks would rely on the misinformation when making their own respective Yen LIBOR submissions to the BBA for inclusion in the published fix. The other big news is that the US Department of Justice has charged two former derivatives brokers and a former cash broker employed by London-based brokerage firm ICAP. They are Darrell Read, who resides in New Zealand, and Daniel Wilkinson and Colin Goodman, both of England, were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and two counts of wire fraud in a criminal complaint unsealed in Manhattan federal court earlier today. They each face a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison for each count upon conviction. Scott D. Hammond, deputy assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division\u2019s criminal enforcement program, said: In exchange for bigger bonus checks, the three defendants undermined financial markets around the world by compromising the integrity of globally used interest rate benchmarks. The Department continues to demonstrate its commitment to protecting the interest of American citizens in free and fair financial markets. Here's the full release from the DoJ The FCA's full final judgement against ICAP is online here. Here's the official quote on the ICAP fine from Tracey McDermott, director of enforcement and financial crime, at the FCA: The misconduct in relation to LIBOR has cast a shadow over the financial services industry. The findings we publish today illustrate, once again, individuals within the industry acting with a cavalier disregard both for regulatory obligations and the interests of the markets. IEL\u2019s significant failings in culture and controls allowed that misconduct to flourish and fell far short of our expectations. Restoring trust in the industry starts with rooting out and recognising bad practice. True change will however only be achieved when all in the financial services industry accept and deliver on their responsibility to ensure that markets operate with integrity. This is our fourth penalty in relation to LIBOR and our investigations continue. The lessons however go far wider than LIBOR and we will take a very dim view of those who do not learn them. The FCA's ruling against ICAP, just published, reports that \"the misconduct was widespread\". It also reports that one broker received \"corrupt bonus payments (at the instigation of one manager)\" as a reward for his assistance in manipulating the Japanese Libor rate. The FCA found that UBS traders made at least 330 written requests to brokers at ICAP Europe Limited for inappropriate submissions, along with an unknown number of \"oral requests\". The FCA added: Three brokers (including one manager) were central to the collusion, although at least seven other individuals (including another manager) spanning three desks also participated. So what did ICAP do wrong? The FCA explains that its employees conspired with traders at UBS to fix the Japanese Yen Libor rate (ie, the rate at which banks would lend to each other in yen). This involved brokers deliberately disseminating incorrect or misleading LIBOR submission levels by emailing skewed suggestions to some Panel Banks as to where they believed the published JPY LIBOR rate would set for a particular day (known as \u201crun-throughs\u201d); and requesting certain Panel Banks to make specific JPY LIBOR submissions. ICAP, the City brokerage firm, has just announced that it's been fined a total of \u00a355m for its role in the Libor scandal. The fine consists of a \u00a314m payment to the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, and the rest to America's CFTC. In another key development, three former executives have been charged by the Department of Justice. In a statement, chief executive Michael Spencer said: We deeply regret and strongly condemn the inexcusable actions of the brokers who sought to assist certain bank traders in their efforts to manipulate YEN Libor. Their conduct contravenes all that ICAP stands for. As soon as their actions came to light, we provided assistance to regulators in the U.S. and U.K. to understand what had happened. None of the three individuals at the centre of the activity remains with the firm. Others are either no longer with the company or are being disciplined. This means ICAP joins Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS for being fined for its role in the scandal in which traders conspired to fix the rate at which banks would lend to each other. More to follow Will the Ukraine be the next country to be dragged into the financial crisis? Its government bonds hit record lows on Tuesday, amid steady selling from anxious bond investors. The cost of insuring its debt against default also spiked yesterday, reflecting fears over liquidity. And the Ukrainian hryvnia has weakened steadily against the US dollar. As I type, Fitch are talking about Ukraine risks... FITCH ANALYST SAYS ANY RAPID FALL IN UKRAINE FX RESERVES, LACK OF CLEAR DEBT REFINANCING POLICY WOULD \"WEIGH ON\" CURRENT B RATING So, now's a good time to check out this piece in the Wall Street Journal, by Serena Ruffoni Ukraine's Troubles Hit Bonds Economists are warning that the French government faces a real struggle to drag its economy forwards, based on today's 2014 budget. Marc Touati, economist at French business consultancy ACDEFI, is concerned that Francois Hollande's government is raising taxes by \u20ac3bn, with the burden falling on households. He said: The tax on households will hurt spending power a little more and we risk having a bad surprise from consumer spending in 2014 Taxes need to be cut on both business and consumers. As explained earlier, today's budget does not increase the total tax burden on companies -- even though Hollande's famous 75% tax on those earning over \u20ac1,000,000 per year will fall on employers. Julien Manceaux, economist at ING Bank in Brussels, said: They are betting on favoring businesses to create jobs and then consumer spending in the longer term. (quotes via the WSJ) Meanwhile Jacob Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, argues that France lacks the motivation to really reform its economy, because it has avoided the worst effects of the eurozone crisis (such as the deep recessions and record jobless totals seen in Southern Europe) There's never going to be a hard landing. ... It's going to be a gradual underperformance. France's fiscal watchdog has checked the numbers in today's budget (see last post), and says the growth forecasts are plausible. However, the structural deficit targets may not be. Here's the key quote (via Reuters) The High Council considers that the structural deficit target for 2014 is optimistic because of a risk of overestimating revenues and of the fragility of forecasts in terms of spending. It's official: France is raising taxes and cutting government spending, in an attempt to lower its deficit next year. As predicted, next year's budget will include \u20ac15bn of cuts to public spending, and \u20ac3bn from tax rises and a clampdown on tax evasion. That's on top of a planned increase in the sales tax, that should being in another \u20ac6bn Paris is also lowering the tax burden on firms, in a bit to boost competitiveness and get the French economy growing faster. And Francois Hollande's famous super-tax on big earners is finally here, Reuters explains: The government announced a change in corporate tax policy, by scrapping an annual flat tax on top of other levies and introducing a new one based on operating profits.It will, as planned, slap a 75-percent tax on salaries exceeding 1 million euros per year, a rate that includes social contributions. The tax will be levied on firms rather than the employees themselves. French firms are also getting \u20ac10bn in tax breaks meant to boost competiveness, the burden will be smaller. But details of the 2014 budget [released earlier than suggested earlier] also show that the French national debt will hit 95.1% of gross domestic product, up from 93.4% this year. That means France's debt servicing costs are expected to rise to \u20ac46.7bn, from \u20ac45bn in 2013. And, as expected, the sums are based on projected growth of 0.9% in 2014, and just 0.1% this year. France's total deficit will be 4.1% of GDP this year, and forecast to fall to 3.6% in 2014. It then hits the 3% target mandated by the EU in 2015 - two year's late. More to follow Overnight, the former head of the International Monetary Fund's mission to Ireland has warned that any more austerity measures might cripple the Republic's economy for years to come. From Dublin, Henry McDonald reports: Professor Ashoka Mody said Ireland needed a \u201cnew jolt of growth\u201d especially since the Republic officially at least emerged from recession last week. Despite turning the corner out of recession Professor Mody pointed out that growth in Ireland over the last 12 months had been very disappointing, \u201cnotwithstanding some ups and downs of an episodic nature.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid we are already five years into the crisis and with households continuing to try to catch up with their lost wealth, they are not spending ... if the Government and households are both not spending, it\u2019s not a surprise that the economy is not growing,\u201d he told RT\u00c9\u2019s Prime Time television programme last night. His warning is apposite given that the Fine Gael-Labour coalition is currently drawing up its battle plans for Budget 2014, which will see millions of euros in more cutbacks in the Republic's huge public sector as the state drives down the national deficit. Meanwhile in the relatively successful IT private sector there is more good news today with Twitter announcing the creation of an extra 100 jobs to its Irish operation. The extra jobs will double the size of the global social network's Dublin office, Twitter said. The investment in more staff is being seen as a major vote of confidence in Twitter's Irish based business. It comes as Facebook, which employs 450 people in Dublin, is also considering increasing its staff numbers in Ireland. Today's strong UK retail sales data (see last post) has bolstered hopes that Britain's economic recovery is continuing. Every single furniture and carpet store surveyed reported higher sales than a year ago, which is the best performance since 1996. That's probably due to increased activity in the housing market as more people move house. Richard Lowe, head of retail &amp; Wholesale at Barclays, said: Retail sales have grown for the third month running, and today\u2019s strong figures will no doubt provide a fillip for the high street. Retailers will now be hoping for more seasonal weather to help sales of new autumn/winter collections and for consumer confidence to tick up as we head towards the crucial Christmas trading period. And here's Howard Archer of IHS's Global Insight: It looks possible that the economy could have grown by close to 1.0% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. Markedly improved consumer confidence and elevated employment seems to be underpinning retail sales, countering the squeeze on purchasing power currently coming from inflation running well above inflation. UK retailers are enjoying their best month's trading since June 2012, with customers flocking to department stores and splashing out on new carpets. The CBI's monthly distributive trade survey, released a few minutes ago, came in at a balance of +34 for September. That's even better than August's +27. Economists had expected a reading of +24. Barry Williams, who chairs the CBI survey panel (when not working at Asda), said the sector wasn't \"out of the woods\" yet, but saw clear signs of recovery. It's encouraging to see the high street on the road to recovery, with particularly strong growth from furniture and carpet retailers, department stores and recreational goods. The balance figure is calculated by taking the percentage of shops who reported a stronger month, and subtracting the percentage of those who said sales were weaker. Reaction to follow.... More than one billion pounds has been wiped off the value of Britain's two largest utility firms today, after Labour leader Ed Miliband announced that he would impose a 20-month price freeze on energy bills if he won the next election. Centrica shares are down almost 4% this morning, knocking some \u00a3800m off its market capitalisation (although around one-third of this is because the stock went \"ex-dividend\" this morning). SSE's shares have are down 3.5%, which cuts around \u00a3500m off its market cap. My colleague Nick Fletcher has more details: Centrica and SSE slide after Labour price freeze pledge Yesterday, Miliband put his pledge of an energy price freeze at the heart of his speech at the Labour party conference. Energy firms have attacked the plan, with Centrica's chairman claiming that caps could 'ruin' the industry. Labour, though, has rubbished the idea that the policy could lead to blackouts. Shadow business spokesman Chuka Umunna told the BBC's Newsnight that claims that the policy would lead to the lights going out were \"patently absurd\" and \"nonsense\". And this morning, Miliband wrote to the energy firms, to ask them to work with him on the issue: Ed Miliband urges energy firms to co-operate with Labour price freeze Three-quarters of Germans want Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble to stay on as finance minister in Angela Merkel's next election, according to a poll published today by Forsa. That poll took place just before Sunday's election, which left Angela Merkel just five seats short of an absolute majority. Sch\u00e4uble has now predicted that Merkel will be able to form a government, rather than resorting to fresh elections. He told Die Zeit that \"there will not be new elections\" as the other parties have a \"basic supply of common sense.\" (translation via AP) Sch\u00e4uble added that he'd prefer \" a quick deal to a slow one, given some important European policy decisions we are faced with, for example on banking union.\" Support for the neo-nazi Golden Dawn party has fallen sharply since the murder of Pavlos Fyssas last week, according to a new opinion poll released this morning. Pollsters at Alco found that just 6.8% of people said they supported Golden Dawn, compared with 10.8% in June (Greek reporter Efthimia Efthimiou flags up) The poll took place between September 20 and 23. Fyssas died in the early hours of September 18, with police swiftly arresting a Golden Dawn supporter who is accused of the stabbing. However, while support for Golden Dawn has fallen, other parties have not seen a significant rise in total support compared with June. The governing New Democracy's support rose slightly to 21%, and the right-wing Independent Greeks (5%) and communist KKE (4.%) parties also polled higher. Support for left-wing parties dropped, both for the opposition Syriza party (19.2%) and junior coalition partners Pasok (6%). Around one third of Greeks didn't express support for any of the parties. A reminder that there's an anti-fascist rally in Athens tonight.... ...and a plug for this piece on Comment Is Free yesterday: The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee has just pledged to keep a close eye on Britain's housing market, but isn't planning to do anything about concerns that a boom is underway in parts of the country. The FPC also flagged up concerns that hedge funds could be exposed to losses if long-term interest rates were to rise. It said a survey of financial firms has found that there was no immediate threat. However, it is worried that those responses \"took account of neither more significant stresses nor potential amplification channels through the financial system\". It warned Borrowers would become more exposed to an increase in interest rates were debt levels to rise and some intermediaries were more affected by a shift in credit spreads. And on housing, it said: Mortgage approvals in July were 30% higher than a year earlier and average house prices in August were 5% higher than a year earlier and had risen more in some parts of the country, particularly London. Nevertheless, activity in the housing market and loan-to-value ratios on new mortgage lending remained below their historic averages. Households\u2019 debt servicing costs were low and the ratio of house prices to earnings was at its level of a decade ago. In view of that, the Committee judged that it should closely monitor developments in the housing market and banks' underwriting standards. The Committee would be vigilant to potential emerging vulnerabilities. Heads-up: we're expecting City broker ICAP to be fined over its part in the Libor scandal this afternoon. My colleague Jill Treanor reports that the firm could be ordered to pay up to \u00a370m -- and it's possible that US regulators could announce charges against certain individuals too. More here: Icap staff braced for Libor charges Good news from Italy in the last few minutes -- its consumer confidence index has hit its highest level since June 2011, before the eurozone crisis flared up and Silvio Berlusconi's government was brought down. ITAST reported that Italian consumer confidence rose to 101.1 on its index, up from August's 98.4. Much better than economists had expected, and based on people reporting that economic conditions right now are better than a month ago. However...the survey did show that Italians are less optimistic about future prospects (the expectations subindex fell) and about the employment market. This table shows the details (apologies if it's too small - The full release is here.) A weak start in the markets today, with all the main European indices losing ground. The FTSE 100 has dropped 32 points, or half a percent, to 6538 -- led by cruise ship Carnival, down 7.5%. That's on top of yesterday's 5% slide, after the company warned that it might take three more years to recover from the Costa Concordia accident in which 32 people died. Asian markets were also down overnight (the Nikkei shed 0.75%). Fears that America's politicians won't hammer out a deal to raise its debt ceiling are starting to haunt the global markets -- with fastFT blaming the looming fiscal cliff. \u2022 German DAX: down 0.5% \u2022 French CAC: down 0.37% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 0.36% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 0.3% Further protests are expected in Greece today, on the second day of the 48-hour strike called by public workers. An anti-fascist demonstration has been called for tonight, to demand action against the neoNazi Golden Dawn party -- one week after the death of rapper Pavlos Fyssas (also known as Killahp). There are also reports in the Greek media that several people are seeking 'witness protection' over Fyssas's death. Last night, the Greek newspaper Kathimerini reported: At least five more members of neofascist Golden Dawn are due to be charged in connection with the murder of Pavlos Fyssas last week after police inspected mobile phone records from the night he was stabbed to death by Giorgos Roupakias, who had close links to the far-right party. Today's French budget (see also 8.12am) will also include its latest growth forecasts. We're expecting the Paris government to predict virtually no growth for 2013, and just 0.9% for next year. France's poor performance this year (it only recently emerged from recession), means its deficit for 2013 will be around 3.6% of GDP. As Reuters puts it: That puts Paris in line with IMF and European Commission forecasts but what Brussels thinks about the plan as a whole is another matter. And as France has struggled for decades to bring public spending down, a promise to save \u20ac15bn next year could be greeted with some caution. Timely... French firms have reported that the business environment has improved this month, but factory bosses aren't sharing the optimism. France's statistics body, INSEE, reported that overall business sentiment picked up in September, to 94 on its index from 91 last month. Industrial firms, though, are gloomier about their prospects. Here's the sector-by-sector details: The French government will try to put the country's recession behind it this afternoon when it publishes its budget for 2014, at 3pm local time or 2pm BST. It's expected to include around \u20ac15bn of cuts to government spending, and \u20ac3bn of tax rises, along with pledges to stimulate growth and unemployment. But as AP explains -- some economists already fear the budget may flop: . The government has promised the measures will re-energize the economy by reducing the role of the state and fostering competition. But economists are split on the merits of cutting spending now. While the move would in principle be welcome in a country where public spending makes up 57 percent of gross domestic product, it will hurt growth in the short term, just as the country is emerging from recession and with unemployment at 11 percent. The modest tax increases, meanwhile, are eliciting grumbles in France, which already has one of the highest tax burdens in the world. The budget appears to be Paris' belated effort to fall in line with the rest of Europe's focus on reducing public debts. The slow approach is typical of Francois Hollande's tenure. The French president is famous for trying not to be famous. His most notable domestic policy so far, the creation of a 75 percent income tax, was rejected by a court and amended so many times that it lost much of its shock value. His reforms have been painstakingly negotiated and have often lost much of their punch by the time they are announced. And the EU's reaction to the budget will also be interesting. Finance minister Pierre Moscovici will fly to Brussels after he's presented his plans to the French cabinet. Will top eurocrats be satisfied with France, after President Hollande's pension reform plans left them cold. As Philippe Gudin, chief European economist at Barclays Capital, explained to BusinessWeek: The retirement reform was disappointing compared with what could have been done -- you almost hesitate to call it a reform The reaction from Brussels on the budget will set the tone of things to come. More here: Hollande Faces Europe\u2019s Glass-Half-Empty Test With Budget Plan Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Busy day ahead, with France issuing its 2014 budget, another day of strikes and protest in Greece, and more political action in Germany following last weekend's election. We can kick off with some economic news \u2013 German consumer confidence has hit its highest level since before the financial crisis began. The monthly survey of German consumers, conducted by GfK, found a \"clear upward trend\", with Germany's public more willing to spend then ever before. Economic expectations were also up, as the eurozone pulled away from recession. GfK's index of consumer climate beat expectations by rising to 7.1 for October (the index looks ahead to the next month). That's the highest in six years. September's reading came in at 7.0, revised up from last month's forecast of 6.9. It's the latest signal of a revival in Europe's largest economy, although those surveyed were less optimistic of rising wages. As GfK put it: German consumers are expecting the economy to gain momentum again in the coming months. This is reflected in the increase in economic expectations, which are on a clear upward trend. Germans' desire to shop also appears to be unbroken. In fact, willingness to buy once again improved on the record value of the previous month. However, income expectations declined for the second consecutive time, but continue to be at an extremely high level. GfK also reported that the eurozone's record low interest rates are making Germans desperate to spend: Despite the fall in income expectations, consumers are almost euphoric when it comes to their propensity to consume. Now is perceived as a good time to make major purchases. Europe's debt woes, though, still loom over Germany. It cannot be ruled out that respondents were influenced by the German parliamentary election for the Bundestag, which had not yet taken place at the time of the survey. Some consumers are perhaps worried that further financial burden will be placed on them, for example, because of the eurozone crisis. And here's the details of this month's survey. I'll be tracking all the developments through the day, as usual....",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Labour's proposals to enforce a freeze on the 'big six' energy suppliers have met with a chorus of disapproval from the industry, but could be popular with voters", 
      "body": "<h2>What is Ed Miliband proposing exactly?</h2> <p>An incoming Labour government in 2015 would impose a price freeze on energy suppliers \u2013 at least for 20 months. He also promised to \"break-up\" the big six \u2013 separating their wholesale power producing arms from their retail supply businesses.</p> <h2>Who are the \"big six\" energy companies?</h2> <p>More than 99% of households energy is supplied by six companies: Centrica (which owns British Gas), SSE (which used to be called Scottish and Southern Energy), Scottish Power, EDF Energy (which is owned by the French government), RWE npower (German), and E.ON (German).</p> <h2>How much money do they make?</h2> <p>The big six made annual profits of \u00a33.7bn in 2012 \u2013 \u00a31.6bn more than in 2009, according to data collated by the Labour party.</p> <p>Centrica, the owner of British Gas, increased its operating profits by 14% in 2012 to \u00a32.74bn.</p> <h2>How much have bills increased by?</h2> <p>The average annual dual fuel household energy bill has risen to \u00a31,420 a year, compared to \u00a31,105 in May 2010, according to Ofgem (the energy market regulator).</p> <p>Miliband accused energy companies of pushing prices up when the market rate of energy goes up, but not bringing prices down when the market rate decreases.</p> <p>\"When wholesale prices go up, people pay more. When they come down, they still pay more,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p> <h2>Are prices in the UK higher than elsewhere?</h2> <p>Energy prices are rising faster in the UK than in any other country in the EU, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p> <p>The OECD report found UK energy prices are 2.2% higher than last year. The rate of energy price inflation is four times the increase in Germany, while prices actually fell in France, Belgium, Denmark and Spain.</p> <h2>Is price control legal?</h2> <p>It would almost definitely be challenged in the courts by the big six firms who dominate the current gas and electricity supply market. But lawyers say it is unclear about whether it is contrary to UK or European law. Certainly many continental countries have some sort of price-setting already.</p> <h2>Are the energy companies right in arguing it will cause the lights go out?</h2> <p>No. There is no reason why a freeze on domestic and business prices for a limited time would have any immediate impact on the lights staying on or going off. The big six claim they barely make profits already on retail but they are still investing \"upstream\" in power stations. Companies like British Gas's parent Centrica have been handing out hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends to investors: not a sign of financial hardship.</p> <h2>What does the industry say?</h2> <p>Sir Roger Carr, the chairman of Centrica, said Miliband's plan is \"potentially a recipe for economic ruin\", and warned that energy companies may stop operating in the UK and would pull back from vital investment in infrastructure.</p> <p>Analysts at Liberum Capital said the proposals would cost energy companies \u00a34.5bn.</p> <p>Stephen Hunt, an analyst at UBS, said the price freeze would be an \"absolutely massive cost for the industry to bear \u2026 it would be quite devastating clearly for these companies' earnings [profits]\".</p> <p>Angela Knight, the boss of the energy industry lobby group EnergyUK, said: \"Freezing the bill may be superficially attractive, but it will also freeze the money to build and renew power stations, freeze the jobs \u2026 and make the prospect of energy shortages a reality, pushing up prices for everyone.\"</p> <h2>Hasn't the regulator, Ofgem, warned about power cuts?</h2> <p>There is no doubt that our energy system is threatened. Last spring Britain nearly ran out of gas. But this is a much wider issue about our lack of storage facilities and the rundown of North Sea gas production. Power stations to produce gas have been mothballed but that it largely because coal-burning is much cheaper.</p> <p>So Labour is right to believe that the measures should not hurt investment in new infrastructure?</p> <p>No. The big six are very active in the wholesale side of the energy industry, where up to \u00a3100bn is needed for new wind farms and other lower-carbon power production. They may well cut investment \u2013 at least in the short term \u2013 arguing that it is because they are making less money and possibly to put pressure on Labour.</p> <h2>So on balance is this a good strategy?</h2> <p>Something needed to be done because the energy market has not been regulated properly and has turned into an oligopoly run by the big six. They control 98% of the retail market and have been able to provide poor services and yet produce strong profits by dominating both wholesale and retail markets.</p> <p>This needed indeed to be reset as Miliband said.</p> <p>But a price freeze and break up will cause great uncertainty, worrying new potential investors and possibly damaging new smaller entrants to retail. Just forcing the big six to sell all their upstream power production to anyone who wants it downstream, would allow new entrants into the market, which might have been enough to reset it.</p>",

He also promised to \"break-up\" the big six \u2013 separating their wholesale power producing arms from their retail supply businesses. Who are the \"big six\" energy companies? More than 99% of households energy is supplied by six companies: Centrica (which owns British Gas), SSE (which used to be called Scottish and Southern Energy), Scottish Power, EDF Energy (which is owned by the French government), RWE npower (German), and E.ON (German). How much money do they make? The big six made annual profits of \u00a33.7bn in 2012 \u2013 \u00a31.6bn more than in 2009, according to data collated by the Labour party. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, increased its operating profits by 14% in 2012 to \u00a32.74bn. How much have bills increased by? The average annual dual fuel household energy bill has risen to \u00a31,420 a year, compared to \u00a31,105 in May 2010, according to Ofgem (the energy market regulator). Miliband accused energy companies of pushing prices up when the market rate of energy goes up, but not bringing prices down when the market rate decreases. \"When wholesale prices go up, people pay more. When they come down, they still pay more,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Are prices in the UK higher than elsewhere? Energy prices are rising faster in the UK than in any other country in the EU, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD report found UK energy prices are 2.2% higher than last year. The rate of energy price inflation is four times the increase in Germany, while prices actually fell in France, Belgium, Denmark and Spain. Is price control legal? It would almost definitely be challenged in the courts by the big six firms who dominate the current gas and electricity supply market. But lawyers say it is unclear about whether it is contrary to UK or European law. Certainly many continental countries have some sort of price-setting already. Are the energy companies right in arguing it will cause the lights go out? No. There is no reason why a freeze on domestic and business prices for a limited time would have any immediate impact on the lights staying on or going off. The big six claim they barely make profits already on retail but they are still investing \"upstream\" in power stations. Companies like British Gas's parent Centrica have been handing out hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends to investors: not a sign of financial hardship. What does the industry say? Sir Roger Carr, the chairman of Centrica, said Miliband's plan is \"potentially a recipe for economic ruin\", and warned that energy companies may stop operating in the UK and would pull back from vital investment in infrastructure. Analysts at Liberum Capital said the proposals would cost energy companies \u00a34.5bn. Stephen Hunt, an analyst at UBS, said the price freeze would be an \"absolutely massive cost for the industry to bear \u2026 it would be quite devastating clearly for these companies' earnings [profits]\". Angela Knight, the boss of the energy industry lobby group EnergyUK, said: \"Freezing the bill may be superficially attractive, but it will also freeze the money to build and renew power stations, freeze the jobs \u2026 and make the prospect of energy shortages a reality, pushing up prices for everyone.\" Hasn't the regulator, Ofgem, warned about power cuts? There is no doubt that our energy system is threatened. Last spring Britain nearly ran out of gas. But this is a much wider issue about our lack of storage facilities and the rundown of North Sea gas production. Power stations to produce gas have been mothballed but that it largely because coal-burning is much cheaper. So Labour is right to believe that the measures should not hurt investment in new infrastructure? No. The big six are very active in the wholesale side of the energy industry, where up to \u00a3100bn is needed for new wind farms and other lower-carbon power production. They may well cut investment \u2013 at least in the short term \u2013 arguing that it is because they are making less money and possibly to put pressure on Labour. So on balance is this a good strategy? Something needed to be done because the energy market has not been regulated properly and has turned into an oligopoly run by the big six. They control 98% of the retail market and have been able to provide poor services and yet produce strong profits by dominating both wholesale and retail markets. This needed indeed to be reset as Miliband said. But a price freeze and break up will cause great uncertainty, worrying new potential investors and possibly damaging new smaller entrants to retail. Just forcing the big six to sell all their upstream power production to anyone who wants it downstream, would allow new entrants into the market, which might have been enough to reset it.",

      "bodyText": "Sales of furniture and carpets are rising strongly as the impact of Britain's recovering housing market affects the rest of the economy, the CBI has said. The latest snapshot of retailing from the employers' organisation showed that shops and stores had a better September than anticipated and expect the improved trading environment to continue into October. The pickup in activity was led by the furniture and carpets sector, where for the first time since 1996 every one of the retailers questioned by the CBI said sales were higher in September than a year earlier. But the monthly distributive trades survey found that the pickup was broad based, with grocers and retailers selling recreational goods also reporting strong growth in sales volumes. Overall, 46% of the 111 firms questioned said business was better than in September 2012 while 12% said it was worse. The balance of +34% was the highest since June 2012 and was accompanied by retailers placing more orders with suppliers. Barry Williams, Asda's chief merchandising officer for food and chairman of the CBI distributive trades survey panel, said: \"It's encouraging to see the high street on the road to recovery, with particularly strong growth from furniture and carpet retailers, department stores and recreational goods retailers. \"But the retail sector is not out of the woods yet with consumer confidence still fragile despite the rise in spending.\" The CBI reported that 22% of retailers said sales volumes were above average for the time of year, while 10% said they were below average. The balance of +12 points was the highest since December 2010. David Tinsley, economist at BNP Paribas, said: \"The most obvious caveat to reading too much into this survey is that the relatively good result in August was not reflected in the official retail sales data for that month, which fell 1%. Still, the broad momentum of sales appears firm and upwards. And the CBI survey suggests this remains the case.\" Richard Lowe, the head of retail and wholesale at Barclays, said: \"Retail sales have grown for the third month running, and these strong figures will no doubt provide a fillip for the high street. \"Retailers will now be hoping for more seasonal weather to help sales of new autumn/winter collections and for consumer confidence to tick up as we head towards the crucial Christmas trading period\".",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has stepped back from taking immediate action to cool the housing market but is monitoring property values closely after house prices returned to their pre-crisis levels. The Bank's financial policy committee, which meets quarterly to assess risks to the financial system, said it is also reviewing work by the Treasury on preventing the risk of cyber-attacks to the banking industry and stepping up its assessment of the vulnerability of hedge funds to sudden changes in interest rates. At a time when George Osborne's housing market schemes are raising concerns about sharp rises in house prices \u2013 particularly in London \u2013 the FPC said it would \"closely monitor developments in the housing market and banks' underwriting standards\". \"The committee would be vigilant to potential emerging vulnerabilities,\" it said in a statement released following its meeting on 18 September. The committee, which is chaired by Bank of England governor Mark Carney, said if it did decide to deploy any of its powers to cool the market \u2013 such as forcing banks to hold more capital \u2013 it would do so gradually. But while it is not moving immediately to cool the housing market, the FPC has been assessing the impact that sharp upward moves in long-term interest rates could have on households and major financial institutions. While it concluded that there was no immediate threat to banks and insurance companies it wants more information about the impact on hedge funds, which borrow money to take bets on stock markets, currencies and commodities. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, will now assess the \"potential amplification\" through the financial system of interest rate changes \u2013 or perceptions of interest rate changes that may be caused by central bank policies on reducing the stimulus currently being pumped into markets to keep interest rates low. \"The levels of leverage within, and therefore the vulnerability of, hedge funds needed to be looked at more closely,\" the FPC said. The FPC's comments on the housing market will be closely watched by the market as the chancellor has insisted he is not creating a housing bubble \u2013 even though property prices have broken through their pre-crisis peak. The average price of a UK house has passed the peak five years ago of \u00a3245,000 but Osborne has said the FPC will have powers to stop any over-inflation in house prices. The FPC noted that while mortgage approvals in July were 30% higher than a year earlier and average house prices in August were 5% higher, activity in the housing market was nevertheless below historic averages. \"Households' debt servicing costs were low and the ratio of house prices to earnings was at its level of a decade ago,\" the FPC said. The committee said it could force banks to change their lending criteria, impose additional capital requirements and make recommendations to the regulators on tightening affordability tests for borrowers. Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said it was reasonable for the FPC to hold back on intervention even though house prices compared with earnings are still above the level of the 1980s housing boom. \"This growing unaffordability should act as a natural check on house price growth. There is no suggestion that banks are about to return to the very loose lending conditions of the mid-2000s, with 110% mortgages and self-certified loans. So the workings of the market may stay the hand of the FPC in having to intervene.\"",

      "bodyText": "Post Office workers have vowed to walk out next week in their 12th strike since Easter, in a bitter dispute over pay and plans to franchise 70 branches. Around 4,000 staff working in 372 Crown offices \u2013 the large post offices in city centres \u2013 will strike next week over plans to turn one fifth of these into franchised outlets in supermarkets and newsagents. The industrial action \u2013 a nationwide strike on Monday, with walkouts in some parts of Scotland on Tuesday \u2013 raises the prospect that the increasingly acrimonious dispute will rumble on until Christmas, the busiest time of year for the Post Office. The Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents Post Office staff, claims the franchise plans will lead to 1,500 job losses and longer queues for customers. The Post Office insists there will be no compulsory redundancies among staff who work at the affected branches, nor a reduction in service. Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of the CWU, warned that the strike and other forms of industrial action could continue until Christmas. \"If the Post Office thinks this dispute will simply fade away they are sadly mistaken. Our members are fiercely opposed to the company's plans to close and franchise offices, slash jobs and impose a pay freeze,\" Ward said. \"The company's plans are to downgrade the network, reduce services to local communities and hit jobs in the network. There is no mandate for this course of action and customers across the country are appalled at the reckless attitude of the Post Office towards these public services.\" The London Assembly and some local authorities, including Manchester city council and Hastings borough council, have raised doubts about the franchising plans. The Post Office, which is state-owned and receives \u00a31.3bn of taxpayer subsidy, has said franchising out branches to retailers is essential to securing the future of the service. Roger Gale, general manager of the Crown network, said the Post Office could not meet the union's \"unaffordable\" pay demands, as the loss-making Crown network had to break even by March 2015. \"We are keen to resolve [the dispute] but it has to be against the backdrop of no increases in the losses of the Crown network. The pay demands the union make will increase those losses and will make it even more difficult if not impossible [to break-even]. He did not see any any end to the dispute soon, he added. The Post Office hopes to turn 35 of the 70 Crown offices into franchises by March 2014. Gale said: \"We will have public meetings when the branches do go into the franchise process and we will happily share with customers and the wider public our plans, which invariably do not mean closures.\" The Post Office is a separate state-owned company from the Royal Mail, which the government intends to privatise. In a separate move, the CWU on Wednesday called on the Labour party to promise to renationalise the Royal Mail, if the sale goes ahead. Labour, which abandoned its attempt to sell-off Royal Mail in 2009, said on Wednesday it hoped to derail the privatisation plans. Labour's shadow business minister, Ian Murray, said he was calling a last-minute debate in the House of Commons to try to stop the sale. \"We're trying to reflect the strength of feeling among the public against this and say to the government it's not too late to change their mind,\" he told Reuters.",
