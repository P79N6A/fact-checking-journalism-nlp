      "bodyText": "The top financial brass from the Treasuries and central banks of Britain and the US are to take part in a war game, behind closed doors in Washington on Monday, to test how they would handle another Lehman Brothers-style banking crisis . Six years after the financial earthquake that led to the multibillion-pound taxpayer bailouts of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, the most senior policymakers from both sides of the Atlantic will try to find out whether they are now any better prepared for the collapse of a bank deemed too big to fail. The chancellor, George Osborne, and Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, will stay on at the end of the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to head the UK team in the exercise, which is to be held at the offices of the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission \u2013 the organisation that guarantees US bank deposits. They will be joined by 11 others, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, the US treasury secretary, Jack Lew, and regulators from Britain and America, for a test of how the authorities would respond to two possible scenarios \u2013 the collapse of an American bank with UK operations and the failure of a British bank with operations in the US. Although the war game will not be based on any specific institution, UK banks with operations in the US include Barclays and HSBC, while US investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have a big presence in the City. Osborne said it was the first time a war game had been conducted at such a senior level. \u201cWe will work through how we would respond to the failure of a cross-border firm. We are going to make sure we could handle an institution previously regarded as too big to fail,\u201d he said. The decision by the US authorities to let Lehman collapse in September 2008 set off a chain reaction in financial markets that was only halted when governments around the world stepped in with taxpayers\u2019 cash to recapitalise banks seen as at risk. Monday\u2019s game will involve the collapse of a single bank rather than the sort of systemic failure threatened in 2008. But Osborne said lessons had been learned from 2008, with policymakers now having options they lacked then. The chancellor said he needed to be sure the government was better prepared for \u201cwhat\u2019s thrown at us and better prepared to protect taxpayers than the previous administration in the UK was\u201d. The last Labour government pumped more than \u00a365bn into RBS and Lloyds in October 2008 but Osborne said \u201cenormous progress\u201d had been making on tackling the too-big-to-fail problem since then. The war game is designed to stress-test the new domestic and global rules for regulating and supervising banks devised since 2008. In the UK, the government has handed new watchdog powers to the City, ring-fenced the retail operations of banks from their investment arms and forced banks to hold more capital. At the global level, the Financial Stability Board, chaired by Carney, has been seeking to ensure financial regulation is consistent across borders. Osborne said: \u201cIn 2008, the judgment of my predecessor and others was that banks like RBS were too big to fail. I want to make sure that either myself or my successors in this job would have real options and would avoid bailing in the taxpayer. I\u2019m pretty confident that is the case.\u201d The chancellor said Monday\u2019s event would try to pack into a morning a crisis that would unfold over several days. \u201cNo war game is like war itself,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cBut it means we will be far better prepared. I\u2019m sure this is not the last time this will happen.\u201dMonday\u2019s war game will take place after the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington in which the risk of a fresh recession in the euro zone has been a dominant theme. Osborne said the problems of the euro zone posed \u201cthe biggest threat to the world and UK economies\u201d and admitted that Britain was \u201cnot immune\u201d to the deteriorating outlook for its biggest trading partner. \u201cThis is a critical moment for the British economy and the world economy\u201d, the chancellor said. \u201cSerious clouds are gathering on the horizon\u201d. Osborne made it clear that he expected UK growth to slow as a result of its exposure to the euro zone. \u201cThere are risks to Britain\u2019s growth from the euro zone and we are seeing some of them materialise\u201d, he said. The chancellor said that the euro zone finance ministers and central bank governors knew they were \u201cunder the microscope\u201d in Washington. \u201cThey know they have some questions to answer.\u201d",

Those who should never have been given loans and have fallen more than 30 days behind with repayments will have their debts wiped entirely, while a further 45,000 who are up to 30 days in arrears will have their interest and charges waived. Wonga has been the subject of growing controversy for making loans of up to \u00a31,000 in a matter of seconds, often to borrowers who ended up taking out further loans to pay off their debts. Although it claimed that an algorithm checked between 6,000 to 8,000 \u201cdata points\u201d for each online application and was a better indication of borrowers\u2019 ability to repay a loan than traditional credit scoring checks, information it supplied to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) confirmed claims by debt charities and campaigners that Wonga was not properly ensuring that customers could afford to meet their commitments. The FCA gave the firm, which quotes an annual interest rate of 5,853%, until the end of Friday to contact those affected by the inadequate affordability checks and Wonga said it would do so by email. Although all week Wonga\u2019s website told customers it would be in touch \u201cby 10 October\u201d, it was late Friday afternoon before the message was updated to say that emails had finally been sent out. Borrowers who have used the company since its launch in 2007 had been in limbo since the news of the write-offs broke last week. One Wonga customer said he did not know whether he should pay an instalment of a repayment plan he had entered with the firm or risk accruing more charges if he was judged not to qualify for a write-off. Wonga said on Friday it had contacted the 375,000 affected customers to let them know what they needed to do next. It urged customers it had contacted not to involve a third party with their case. The email from Wonga to the customers affected explained that the company \u201cwill automatically clear any outstanding debt you have with us\u201d by the end of October. \u201cYou do not need to do anything.\u201d It added: \u201cWe recognise that we may not have always made the right lending decisions and for this we apologise. We intend to be sure in the future that we only lend to customers who can reasonably afford to repay their loans.\u201d As well as writing off loans at a cost of \u00a3220m, Wonga has been forced to scrap its affordability checks and is working on new lending criteria scrutinised by the FCA. Customers caught up in the action have been assured that details of their loans will be removed from their credit files. The fact that they applied to borrow will still show up. Wonga has also agreed to contact the remainder of its 1 million customers, informing those who are not affected that this is the case. The regulator said there was no timeframe for this, but it expected notices to be given as quickly as possible. Discussions between the firm and FCA are continuing, and many borrowers are hoping that redress will be extended to those who were able to keep up with repayments, even though they should not have been offered a loan.",

Recent years have been less kind, with the retailer forced to retreat from the US after losing some \u00a31.8bn on the failed Fresh &amp; Easy venture in California and Nevada. While Lewis might like to offload its struggling business in central Europe, it is its more successful operations in Asia that are more likely to interest investors.

Even six months ago it seemed unlikely that the duo would have to go cap in hand to their shareholders to ask for cash via rights issues. Now how they will raise fresh finance is the main debate among City analysts.</p> <p>The problem for both companies is simple: when sales and profits start to slide, financial ratios can go haywire. Tesco had net debt of \u00a36.6bn in February, the end of its last financial year. In the old days that would have been seen as a light burden for a company of its size and profitability. Pre-tax profits were still \u00a33bn last year and the sum of cash generated by the stores was \u00a33.5bn.</p> <p>But look at the claims on that cash. Almost \u00a3500m was paid in interest to lenders; the tax bill was \u00a3347m; the dividend to shareholders cost \u00a31.1bn; and capital expenditure across the group was \u00a32.7bn. If new Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis decides to cut prices \u2013 and profit margins \u2013 he has to be able to fund the fightback without simply piling on more debt.</p> <p>Lewis can sell assets \u2013 such as Dunnhumby or its Asian business \u2013 but disposals won\u2019t provide immediate cash and nobody wants to be seen as a forced seller. It could also make savings: the group has already said it will chop its dividend by 75%, a big saving. Lewis can also stop opening more hypermarkets \u2013 Margate is the latest to be axed.</p> <p>But some costs can\u2019t be avoided. Rent still has to be paid on the stores Tesco leases. Cutting staff, and thus the level of customer service, would probably be a false economy. Then there\u2019s the deficit in the pension fund, which is now looming large. The gap widened from \u00a31.8bn to \u00a32.6bn last year.</p> <p>\u201cSuch are the concerns around the balance sheet at current levels of profitability that we expect a rights issue would be positively received by the market,\u201d thinks HSBC\u2019s analyst David McCarthy. He thinks Tesco needs \u00a33bn \u2013 minimum \u2013 to make a difference.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s is a simpler business \u2013 it doesn\u2019t operate overseas \u2013 but a full strategic review is under way and chief executive Mike Coupe has said it will include the dividend policy and funding strategy. It is easy to see why the dividend is in peril: last year\u2019s payment was worth 17.3p a share, but the City thinks earnings will be only 28.4p this year. Maintaining the dividend would breach the rule of thumb that dividends should be covered at least twice by earnings.</p> <p>Opinion is divided about the need for a rights issue, but the company\u2019s refusal to disclose details of its banking covenants on the grounds of commercial confidentiality has heightened suspicions. And, if the market leader is rearming for a price war, shouldn\u2019t Sainsbury\u2019s?</p> <p>\u201cWe think it is unrealistic to believe that its [Sainsbury\u2019s] quality positioning will make it immune to Tesco\u2019s inevitable price positioning,\u201d says Jamie Vazquz of JP Morgan Cazenove. \u201cWe remain of the view that the negative top line trends will lead to a major cut in the dividend and a potential rights issue.\u201d</p>",

Now how they will raise fresh finance is the main debate among City analysts. The problem for both companies is simple: when sales and profits start to slide, financial ratios can go haywire. Tesco had net debt of \u00a36.6bn in February, the end of its last financial year. In the old days that would have been seen as a light burden for a company of its size and profitability. Pre-tax profits were still \u00a33bn last year and the sum of cash generated by the stores was \u00a33.5bn. But look at the claims on that cash. Almost \u00a3500m was paid in interest to lenders; the tax bill was \u00a3347m; the dividend to shareholders cost \u00a31.1bn; and capital expenditure across the group was \u00a32.7bn. If new Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis decides to cut prices \u2013 and profit margins \u2013 he has to be able to fund the fightback without simply piling on more debt. Lewis can sell assets \u2013 such as Dunnhumby or its Asian business \u2013 but disposals won\u2019t provide immediate cash and nobody wants to be seen as a forced seller. It could also make savings: the group has already said it will chop its dividend by 75%, a big saving. Lewis can also stop opening more hypermarkets \u2013 Margate is the latest to be axed. But some costs can\u2019t be avoided. Rent still has to be paid on the stores Tesco leases. Cutting staff, and thus the level of customer service, would probably be a false economy. Then there\u2019s the deficit in the pension fund, which is now looming large. The gap widened from \u00a31.8bn to \u00a32.6bn last year. \u201cSuch are the concerns around the balance sheet at current levels of profitability that we expect a rights issue would be positively received by the market,\u201d thinks HSBC\u2019s analyst David McCarthy. He thinks Tesco needs \u00a33bn \u2013 minimum \u2013 to make a difference. Sainsbury\u2019s is a simpler business \u2013 it doesn\u2019t operate overseas \u2013 but a full strategic review is under way and chief executive Mike Coupe has said it will include the dividend policy and funding strategy. It is easy to see why the dividend is in peril: last year\u2019s payment was worth 17.3p a share, but the City thinks earnings will be only 28.4p this year. Maintaining the dividend would breach the rule of thumb that dividends should be covered at least twice by earnings. Opinion is divided about the need for a rights issue, but the company\u2019s refusal to disclose details of its banking covenants on the grounds of commercial confidentiality has heightened suspicions. And, if the market leader is rearming for a price war, shouldn\u2019t Sainsbury\u2019s? \u201cWe think it is unrealistic to believe that its [Sainsbury\u2019s] quality positioning will make it immune to Tesco\u2019s inevitable price positioning,\u201d says Jamie Vazquz of JP Morgan Cazenove. \u201cWe remain of the view that the negative top line trends will lead to a major cut in the dividend and a potential rights issue.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Asda\u2019s profits jumped 5% last year as the supermarket outperformed rivals including Tesco and Morrisons by keeping a tight rein on costs while increasing sales. The Walmart-owned store boosted profits despite a weak sales performance that saw turnover rise by 2% to \u00a322.8bn. However, a drive by the UK\u2019s second largest supermarket to cut down on wastage and distribution costs helped push underlying profits to \u00a3718.6m, excluding payments to its US parent. Excluding new stores open for less than a year, sales rose by just 0.6% in 2013. Asda\u2019s performance outshines that of Tesco and Morrisons, both of which saw underlying sales and profits fall in the UK last year. Both have seen a deterioration this year and Sainsbury\u2019s fortunes have also taken a turn for the worse as the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl has forced all the major chains to slash prices on everyday basics such as bread and milk. Asda is the only one of the big four supermarkets currently increasing market share and sales after it slashed prices late last year. According to figures for Asda Group filed at Companies House, Asda\u2019s bosses received \u00a3800,000 less in salary and \u00a3600,000 less in share bonuses. A hefty slug of that was borne by the company\u2019s highest paid director, Andy Clarke, who saw his salary and share payouts drop \u00a3440,000. Excluding the impact of payments, share options, expenses and royalties paid to Walmart, Asda said its underlying operating profit rose by 5% to \u00a3718.6m. Cutting out middlemen to buy more goods directly from suppliers and using energy-efficient instore lighting helped boost profits. Asda said job cuts had not been a major contributor to last year\u2019s profit rise, although the accounts show that it employed more than 1,000 fewer people despite opening 15 new outlets last year. Analysts said Asda had apparently enjoyed a strong year in 2013, although it was difficult to judge the supermarket\u2019s performance compared with Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s because of the opaque nature of the private company\u2019s accounts. Richard Clarke, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said the company currently had incentives to book more profits in the UK because of the UK\u2019s lower corporate tax rates compared with the US. Clarke said: \u201cThis looks like encouraging news. The figures appear to indicate that Asda is achieving operating margins of 4.8%, close to Tesco\u2019s full year margin for 2013-14. \u201cIt shows it\u2019s possible to run low-cost hypermarkets and still enjoy strong profits.\u201d Clarke cautioned that it was not possible to unpick Asda\u2019s reported figures fully because, as a private company in the UK, it did not have to report in as much detail as publicly listed rivals. He added: \u201cThis is also a long time ago in UK retail. So much has happened in the 10 months since the period these figures relate to ended. Asda announced millions of pounds worth of price cuts in November last year and only one month of those will be in these numbers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Global stock markets came under renewed pressure on Friday in a widespread sell-off prompted by fears of a global economic slowdown, tensions in the Middle East and the spread of the Ebola virus. After another volatile week, the FTSE 100 slumped to its worst level since 9 October last year, falling 91.88 points or 1.4% to 6,339.97. The index fell for the third week in succession for the first time since March. Since its recent peak of 6,878 in September, the FTSE has dropped about 8%, close to the 10% level which stock market analysts label as a correction. Meanwhile Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.4% on Friday to 8,788 and France\u2019s Cac closed 1.6% lower at 4,073. After European markets had closed, Finland was stripped of its top-notch triple A rating and France warned it faced the risk of further downgrade to its AA rating. S&amp;P was the first of the major ratings agencies to cut Finland\u2019s prized rating because of its fear the country could suffer \u201cprotracted stagnation\u201d and its exposure to Russia and the eurozone. Only Germany and Luxembourg remain triple A rating in the eurozone. On Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average, which lost 334 points or nearly 2% on Thursday, made an uncertain start and closed down 0.69% on the previous day. Emphasising the uncertainty facing US investors, the Vix volatility index jumped 8% to its highest level since December 2012. Jasper Lawler, a market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said European markets had been hit by US investors liquidating their holdings. He said: \u201cThis week has seen the biggest weekly US outflow from European stocks in two months and total European assets held by US funds have dropped to $40bn (\u00a325bn) down from nearly $50bn in June, according to Lipper data.\u201d This week\u2019s market declines followed news that the International Monetary Fund had cut its global growth forecasts for 2014 to 3.3% from the 3.7% it was predicting in April. While it expects a pickup to 3.8% in 2015, it warned its predictions could still be too optimistic. Construction figures on Friday emphasised the fragile state of the UK economy, with a sharp fall in new housebuilding in August sending output down 3.9% compared with July, the first fall for 18 months. UK trade data showed the deficit falling from \u00a33.1bn in July to \u00a31.9bn in August, though mainly as a result of a substantial drop in imports from non-EU countries rather than the hoped-for surge in exports. But it is the outlook for China which has been preoccupying investors recently, given the country is the driving force for much of the global economy. Recent data raised fears of a slowdown, with a disappointing service sector survey this week adding more evidence. Worries about the eurozone came to the fore this week after a poor set of industrial production figures from Germany was swiftly followed by news of a 5.8% fall in its exports, compared with expectations of a 4% decline. The fall was the biggest since January 2009, and showed the effects of the sanctions on Russia over Ukraine, as well as the wider slowdown in the eurozone. Germany\u2019s economy shrank by 0.2% in the second quarter, so a second consecutive contraction in GDP in the third quarter would tip it into a technical recession. There were reports that the government would next week lower its estimates for GDP growth to 1.2% for both 2014 and 2015, from 1.8% for this year and 2% for next year. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, added to the gloom on Thursday by saying in Washington that the eurozone recovery was running out of steam. Analysts are nervous that Draghi\u2019s plans to stimulate the flagging eurozone economy with a bond-buying programme have still not been fully implemented and may not be sufficient anyway. Other central banks, notably the US Federal Reserve, have been gradually turning off the money that has been supporting the global markets for the past six years since the global crash which followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The prospect of this support ending, and of interest rates rising, had already started to unsettle markets. There was a brief respite from the week\u2019s slide when the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting suggested it was in no rush to raise rates, but this proved short-lived. News that the firsta case of Ebola outside west Africa had been confirmed in Spain added to the market pessimism, hitting the travel and leisure sectors particularly hard. In the two days following the Spanish case, \u00a32bn was wiped off the value of leading UK airlines, travel agents and hotels before their shares stabilised. On top of that came the current geopolitical tensions, with air strikes on Isis, the Ukraine situation and the repercussions of the recent protests in Hong Kong. The prospect of a global slowdown also hit oil prices. With oversupply and falling demand, Brent crude fell more than 3% over the week, standing at just over $89 a barrel on Friday. But gold, seen as a haven for investors in turbulent times, has added nearly 3% since Monday to $1,220 an ounce, its best weekly performance since the end of June.",

      "bodyText": "A sharp rise in lending to the world\u2019s poorest countries will leave them with crippling debt payments over the next decade, a few years after many had loans written off, a report has warned. The Jubilee Debt Campaign said as many as two-thirds of the 43 developing countries it analysed could suffer large increases in the share of government income spent on debt payments over the next decade. Coinciding with the World Bank\u2019s annual meeting in Washington, the anti-poverty campaigners accuse the international lender and other public bodies of \u201cleading the lending boom\u201d to poor countries without checking how repaying debts will divert resources from cutting poverty. The report highlights that for 43 poor countries, half of lending is from multilateral institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and African Development Bank. Total lending to the group of poor countries has increased by 60% from $11.4bn (\u00a37.1bn) a year in 2009 to $18.5bn in 2013. \u201cThere is a real risk that today\u2019s lending boom is sowing the seeds of a new debt crisis in the developing world, threatening to reverse recent gains in the fight against poverty and inequality,\u201d said Sarah-Jayne Clifton, director of the Jubilee Debt Campaign. \u201cThe shocking thing is that public bodies like the World Bank are leading the lending boom, not just reckless private lenders hunting for returns.\u201d The campaigners are calling for measures to make lending more responsible and for aid-giving to be shifted away from bodies like the World Bank that give loans towards sources that give it in the form of grants. The analysis uses IMF and World Bank data on developing country debts and projects the cost of payments under the following three scenarios: predictions of continuous high economic growth are realised; estimates of one economic shock over the next decade prove correct; and economic growth is lower than the standard prediction. Even if high growth rates are achieved, 11 of the 43 poor countries would still see the share of government income spent on debt payments increase rapidly, or by more than five percentage points of government revenue, the report says. Under the second scenario, 25 countries are at risk. That rises to 29 countries under the third. The report highlights that aside from the rise in lending, on the other side of the equation government revenues are not rising to keep pace with repayments. As such, the campaigners are urging the UK government to push for policies that support developing countries in increasing their tax revenues by clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion.",

      "bodyText": "The relentless fall in European markets continued, writes Nick Fletcher, as investors worried about the eurozone economy after the week\u2019s poor figures from Germany and comments from ECB president Mario Draghi that the recovery was running out of steam. And although the US market managed to edge higher in early trading, it was not a convincing rise after the 2% decline on Thursday. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 91.88 points or 1.43% lower at 6339.97 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.4% to 8788.81 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.64% at 4073.71 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.94% to 19,200.97 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.2% down at 10,150.5 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 88 points or 0.5% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s the latest views on the eurozone crisis from Dutch finance Minister and Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem: Here\u2019s hoping for cheaper petrol, at least: Now the Dow has bobbed back into negative territory, in rather choppy trading. Back in Washington, UK chancellor George Osborne has warned that Germany\u2019s recent weak factory and export data is a big concern. OSBORNE SAYS GERMAN ECONOMIC DATA IS GREATEST CONCERN IN EUROPE OSBORNE, ASKED ABOUT GERMANY, SAYS HE IS SKEPTICAL ABOUT REPEATED CALLS FOR MORE PUBLIC SPENDING OSBORNE SAYS SUPPORTIVE OF JAPAN\u2019S \u201cTHREE ARROWS,\u201d WANTS TO MAKE SURE ARROW OF STRUCTURAL REFORM IS FIRED After a weak start, the US stock market is actually a little higher in early trading. The Dow Jones has risen by 49 points, or 0.29%, to 16708. That claws back a little of yesterday\u2019s rout (in which the Dow lost 335 points). The S&amp;P 500 index is also up, around 0.24%,. The technology-heavy Nasdaq has lost another 0.5%, though, pushed down by last night\u2019s profit warning from Microchip Technologies. Over in Washington, chancellor George Osborne is reiterating his warning that the eurozone could drag the UK economy back. He says there are \u201cserious clouds\u201d on the horizon, particularly the bit beyond the White Cliffs of Dover: Here are the newsflashes: BRITAIN\u2019S OSBORNE SAYS SERIOUS CLOUDS GATHERING ON ECONOMIC HORIZON, BIGGEST RISK IS EURO ZONE FALLING BACK INTO RECESSION OSBORNE SAYS BRITAIN IS NOT POWERLESS IN FACE OF EXTERNAL RISKS, HAS ECONOMIC PLAN REFERRING TO EURO COUNTRIES, OSBORNE SAYS IF YOU CREATE RULES ON FISCAL GUIDELINES, YOU CAN\u2019T BREAK THE RULES AT THE FIRST TEST Here\u2019s a cautionary tale for anyone eating at their desk and spilling crumbs all over the floor (ahem...), staff at UBS\u2019s offices in London are fighting off an invasion of mice. Financial News reports: UBS is looking for a cat with a large appetite, as staff struggle to control a mouse infestation inside its London office. A number of people at the bank have told Financial News that they have seen mice scamper across desks, run past client meeting rooms and hide in draws. Two people inside the 100 Liverpool St office blamed nearby construction work as the cause of the rodent invasion, with digging for Europe\u2019s biggest construction project, Crossrail, \u201cforcing them [mice] into surrounding buildings\u201d. \u201cOne mouse went into a managing director\u2019s draw and ate his nuts, while another ran over an MD\u2019s foot and she screamed while on a call,\u201d said one ex-employee, who recently left the bank.... More here: Fat cat wanted as mice invade UBS Fears over a looming eurozone recession, the wider global economy, the Middle East turmoil and Ebola have all help to drive stock markets down across Europe and Asia. The FTSE 100 is down 66 points at 6365, and on track for a new one-year closing low. Earlier it fell as low as 101 points. Germany\u2019s Dax is also in retreat, having tumbled 2% or 183 points to 8825. That\u2019s also a one-year low, as concern grows that Germany is entering recession. With the French CAC down 1%, the MCSI index of world top shares is at its lowest point since April. The copper price fell, on growth worries. And the Brent oil price remains below $89/barrel, having hit a four-year low in early trading. Earlier, the Japanese Nikkei shed 1.1% and Australia\u2019s market suffered its biggest one-day loss in 15 months. Analysts say that \u201cnegative sentiment is rife\u201d in the markets today, although the falls do not, yet any, constitute a crash. H2O Markets\u2019 chief market strategist, Mike Jarman, sums up the mood: \u201cThe economic cycle has stalled, European macroeconomic data is starting to slow and the U.S. is in a hold position as investors continue to digest the tightening cycle and what it means for future growth prospects\u201d ETX Capital pointed to four key factors, particularly yesterday\u2019s alarmingly weak German exports (down 5.8% in August) Weak German export data raised fears yesterday that Europe\u2019s Economic turmoil could drag down the Global economy. Economic sanctions on Russia are halting Germany\u2019s growth and in turn the Euro zone, causing US and Asian shares to go into meltdown last night. The mood in Germany was further darkened by rumour that the Berlin government will cut its growth forecasts next week. In other news... The Bank of England has released details of its contingency plans for if Scotland had voted for independence The minutes of the latest meeting of its Financial Policy Committee also show it is worried about the eurozone, and China\u2019s slowing economy. The UK trade deficit has narrowed, but Britain is still importing more than it exports. And UK construction workers took a surprise breather in August, with output down 3.9%. George Osborne won\u2019t be happy... A couple of dates for the diary... the Bank of England has announced that it will release the results of its stress tests of UK banks on 16 December, at 7am GMT sharp. And the eagerly-awaited eurozone stress tests, and asset-quality review, is due on Sunday 26 October. Those results will show which banks need to raise more capital to protect themselves from future losses, and could shake out so-called \u2018\u2019zombie banks\u2019 from the eurozone.... German economists are hitting back against the notion that the country is heading off the rails. Berenberg bank has tweeted this chart, to put August\u2019s poor economic data into some context: And Matthias Heisse, managing partner in Munich for law firm Eversheds, pins the blame firmly on other countries - for not buying more of Germany\u2019s goods: \u201cExports have always been the backbone of the German economy but are of course dependant on buyers with money and foreign markets. Many eurozone countries are still in crisis and the economic sanctions against Russia did not support German exports. Nevertheless, future prospects still remain broadly encouraging. The labour market seems to be very stable and domestic demand for goods could well rise, due to the minimum wage. Ultimately, it is exports, not the German economy, that is crumbling.\u201d Every share on the German DAX has fallen today. The biggest faller is Infineon Technologies, down 7% after rival chipmaker Microchip Technology released a profits warning overnight. Several German automobile makers are also down around 3% , including BMW and Volkswagen. Here\u2019s the top fallers in the broad-based selloff: The Frankfurt stock market looked pretty calm this morning, as the DAX hit its lowest level of the year. No sign of traders with the heads in their hands. After all, it\u2019s only money.... And here\u2019s a chart from Hargreaves Lansdown showing how markets have fallen from their recent highs: Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says that \u201cnegative sentiment is rife\u201d in the financial markets today. Worrying scenarios are thick on the ground. Take your pick from the spreading Ebola virus, conflict in the Middle East, withdrawal of QE in the US, and Europe teetering on the brink of deflation. Another worry is that the US Federal Reserve is likely to end its bond-buying stimulus scheme at its next policy meeting at the end of October. Khalaf adds: Markets are likely to fret while they watch central banks pass the relay baton onto economic growth, in the hope they don\u2019t drop it. It\u2019s obviously been a bad week in the stock markets -- the FTSE 100, for example, has shed 178-odd points or 2.7%. And that makes it the biggest fall in, err, two weeks; shares also tumbled as September drew to close. There\u2019s a lot of chatter about whether global markets are entering a serious correction, after a long bull rally. We won\u2019t know for a while, but right now, it certainly can\u2019t be called a crash. Darren Courtney-Cook, head of trading at Central Markets Investment Management, doesn\u2019t reckon markets will turn around quickly (via Reuters): \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be a full-on meltdown, but I think we will be in a bearish market for the next few weeks\u201d. Tin hats on, then, as some say in the City... The news that UK construction output fell by 3.9% in August alone will not please chancellor George Osborne, our economics correspondent Phillip Inman writes: The figures will disappoint the Treasury, which has championed housebuilding as a way out of the current housing crisis. The fall in infrastructure construction will also prove a blow to George Osborne, who has repeatedly said new transport and digital infrastructure is necessary for sustainable growth. Full story: Housebuilding falls for first time 18 months, ONS says The US stock market is expected to suffer further losses when Wall Street opens in three hours time. Steve Collins, global head of dealing at London &amp; Capital Asset Management, has the details: The selloff in Europe and Asia today has helped to pull down global shares to their lowest level in six months. The MSCI All-Country World index is down 0.8% to its lowest level since April 18. It\u2019s shed 1.9% this week. Crumbs, it\u2019s now a triple-digit loss on the Footsie. The FTSE 100 is currently down 101 points, at 6330, down 1.5%. That means it\u2019s lost 4.4% in October alone. Mike McCudden at Interactive Investor adds his voice to those blaming the slowdown in Germany\u2019s economy for today\u2019s selloff: The stuttering global economy continues to spook investors who appear to be on a mass exodus from equities to safer havens. Furthermore, with the German economy leading the euro zone from the frying pan in to the fire there are grave concerns for the future of the region. Tui Travel, the holiday firm, is now the biggest faller in the City, down 7%. Nick Fletcher\u2019s market report has the details: Tui Travel leads FTSE 100 lower as economy and Ebola fears continue Here\u2019s the situation across the European markets at 11am. Losses across the board.... The selloff in Europe\u2019s stock markets is accelerating. Fears over a possible eurozone recession, Ebola, and geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East all hit stocks. The FTSE 100 is now down 91 points at 6340, a fall of 1.4%, to a new one-year low. It looks destined to record its third weekly loss in a row, as the selloff that began on Wall Street last night, and then shook Asian markets (details here) reverberates around Europe too. And in Frankfurt, the German DAX has suffered big losses, down 2.1% at 8799, amid those rumours that the government will slash its growth forecasts. That\u2019s also the lowest level for the DAX since October 2013. And Brent crude oil remains below the $90-per-barrel, having hit a new four-year low of $88.11 this morning (details). Analysts at ETX Capital blame the slump on \u201cgrowing fears\u201d about Europe\u2019s weak economy: Weak German export data raised fears yesterday that Europe\u2019s Economic turmoil could drag down the Global economy. Economic sanctions on Russia are halting Germany\u2019s growth and in turn the Euro zone, causing US and Asian shares to go into meltdown last night. Energy and mining stocks are being hit hard, as FT Markets editor Chris Adams flags up: That\u2019s because slower global growth will mean less demand for oil, copper, iron ore, etc.... Will Hedden of IG explains: Any name with a sniff of commodity exposure is struggling, be it oil or metal. Brent crude is below $90 for the first time in over two years, iron ore is in a similar position and this is making related names feel very unloved. Australian shareholders are nursing losses after its main stock market suffered its biggest one-day fall since July 2013. Australian shares plummet, with $34bn lost in a day This morning\u2019s UK trade data shows that the gap between what Britain exports and imports has narrowed, for the first time since March. That\u2019s due to a substantial drop in imports from non-EU countries, rather than a surge in exports. The ONS says: Notably, this is the first time in the past five months that the trade in goods deficit has narrowed and although exports fell in August, imports fell more heavily. Britian\u2019s deficit on trade in goods was \u00a39.1bn, while the surplus on trade in services was \u00a37.2bn. That means the overall deficit was \u00a31.9bn in August, down from \u00a33.1bn in July. Exports of goods fell by \u00a30.7bn to \u00a323.2bn, mainly due to a drop in oil exports. That\u2019s the lowest since September 2010. Imports decreased by \u00a32bn to \u00a332.3bn, which is the largest monthly decrease since July 2006. That was primarily due to a fall in \u2018erratic items\u2019, aircraft and non-monetary gold into the UK. Rob Wood of Berenberg warns that the wider picture is still weak: The UK trade deficit remains sizeable as strong domestic demand drags in imports while exports are being hit by still weak Eurozone growth and recently weakening trade with non-EU countries. Britain\u2019s construction sector suffered an unexpected drop in activity in August, suggesting the building trade\u2019s recovery slowed over the summer. The Office for National Statistics reports that construction output tumbled by 3.9% in August, compared with July. Now, this monthly data can be volatile, especially when it covers the summer holidays. But the ONS suggests that work fell across most areas of the construction industry, particularly housebuilding. The ONS says: All new work decreased by 4.8%, with all types of work except public new housing reporting decreases; infrastructure (6.5%); private commercial (5.6%); private housing (5.5%); private industrial (4.9%); and public other (2.4%). However, the fall in private housing provided the largest contribution to the overall fall in all new work and all work. And here\u2019s the key chart: Now this is interesting... the Bank of England has released some details of the plans it had made in case the Yes campaign had won last month\u2019s referendum on Scottish independence. The minutes of the last meeting of its Financial Policy Committee show that the BoE was poised to attempt to calm the market panic, had Scotland voted to become an independent country. The Bank of England would have immediately announced plans to supply extra bank notes and pump extra liquidity into banks. The BoE would also have immediately pledged that it remained responsible for financial stability across the whole of the UK: In the event of a \u2018yes\u2019 vote it would issue a statement immediately reaffirming its responsibilities for financial stability, prudential regulation, banknotes and monetary policy in the entire United Kingdom, including Scotland, until legislation enacting independence came into force. On banknotes, the minutes say that: The Committee noted that the Bank had in place arrangements to meet potential increased demand for Bank of England notes from holders of Scottish notes. Under current arrangements, Scottish banknotes are backed fully by their issuers\u2019 holdings of Bank of England notes, UK coin and deposits at the Bank of England. This would have been a key public message in the event of a \u2018yes\u2019 vote. The BoE would also held two extra, unscheduled \u201cLong-Term Repo operations\u201d; in which it would have accepted assets from banks in exchange for cash, to ensure liquidity levels remained as high as needed. The minutes are online here (pdf). Here comes the UK trade data for August..... and the top line is that the trade in goods balance fell to \u00a39.099bn, which is the smallest deficit since April. Exports fell by 2.3% month-on-month, while imports tumbled by 6.2%. More to follow.... Unless the FTSE 100 stages a late rally (and it\u2019s currently down 49 points), it will rack up its third weekly decline in a row. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, comments: \u201cThis line about Germany slipping into recession is simply layering on another level of angst to a market that is already wary of the threat posed by the likes of Ebola in West Africa and Islamic State in the Middle East,\u201d It\u2019s been quite a decline. On September 3rd, the FTSE was trading at 6,873. It\u2019s now almost 500 points lower, at 6382. Italian industrial output rose by 0.3% in August, reversing some of July\u2019s 1.0% tumble, according to data just released. That\u2019s a stronger reading than France, where output was flat (see 8.01am), and much better than Germany\u2019s 4% tumble (see Tuesday\u2019s story). But.... economists had expected a 0.5% increase, to help pull Italy out of its recession. Germany\u2019s economy ministry has just predicted that the country\u2019s exporters could struggle to sell their wares in the coming months. In its new monthly report, the ministry says that the weak eurozone economy, and lacklustre global demand, will limit demand for German exports. \u201dIn coming months we must count on exports developing in a very restrained way.... robust job market, rising incomes and stable prices will mean private consumption continues to play a positive role\u201d. The warning comes a day after we learned that German exports had tumbled by an alarming 5.8% in August. The copper price has also fallen today, hit by those growth fears. The price of a tonne of copper dropped by 1.1% to $6,645, still above the five-month low of $6,600 set on October 2nd. Developments in Germany.....Reuters is reporting that the Berlin government is preparing to slash its growth forecasts. According to sources, the German government will lower its estimates for GDP expansion in both 2014 and 2015 to around 1.2%, down from 1.8% this year and 2% next year. That follows weak factory data in August, and Germany\u2019s fall into recession in the second quarter of this year. Cruise firm Carnival is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 this morning, down 2.8%, on fears that the spread of Ebola will hit global tourism. Most of the other big fallers are mining companies, such as Fresnillo (silver), Anglo American (copper, platinum)and Randgold (gold). Europe\u2019s main markets are a sea of red this morning, as this chart from the Reuters terminal shows: The falls aren\u2019t shocking, but it takes the FTSEurofirst index of leading European shares down to a two-month low. The FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip shares has hit its lowest level in exactly a year, at the start of trading in Europe. The FTSE fell as much as 51 points to 6379, a level last seen on 10 October 2013. Other European markets are also in the red, as global growth fears (see opening post) continue to stalk the trading floors. The German Dax fell 0.9%, France\u2019s CAC and Italian MIB both shed 0.7% and the Spanish IBEX is down 0.6%. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says that: \u201cconcerns about German and European economic growth continue to erode risk appetite, and send investors scurrying for the exits.\u201d The oil price has fallen to its lowest level since 2010 this morning, amid predictions that energy demand will be lower than expected. Brent crude, which hits the $90 per barrel mark last night, has fallen further today. It hit a low of $88.11 per barrel this morning, a level not seen since November 2010. Analysts are now speculating whether the OPEC cartel might intervene to prop prices up: Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, says: \u201cI think we\u2019ve arrived at a pivotal support level for both Brent and West Texas Intermediate. $85 is the area where OPEC has intervened in the market in the past,\u201d \u201dI\u2019m not saying they will come in this time. They need to consider the overall supply situation \u2013 it might be too expensive.\u201d Just in - French industrial production was stable in August, unchanged from July. That\u2019s better than expected -- economists had pencilled in a fall of 0.2%. However, that\u2019s partly due to higher energy and utility production in August (when it was unusually chilly). The narrower measure of manufacturing output, which strips out energy, shrank by 0.2%, showing that the French economy isn\u2019t exactly firing on all cylinders. It\u2019s been a bad day\u2019s trading in Asia, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei losing 1%, and the Hong Kong Hang Seng down almost 2%. Here\u2019s the damage: Stan Shamu of IG says the selloff was partly due to hawkish comments from US Federal Reserve policymakers, which suggested a US interest rate rise could come in the middle of next year. He adds: The sell-off in the US equity market was attributed to concerns around German growth, with some also looking at growing ease about Ebola. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. European stock markets are expected to fall sharply when trading begins today, as concerns grow over the strength of the global recovery. Last night\u2019s selloff on Wall Street -- the Dow shed 335 points in its biggest fall this year -- has triggered a sell-off in the Asia-Pacific region, with Australia\u2019s main index losing 2%. In London, the FTSE 100 is expected to hit its lowest level in over a year when trading begins. And the oil price is also coming under pressure, reflecting concerns that global growth will be weaker than hoped, especially if the eurozone enters recession. The rash of weak economic news from Germany this week (poor exports, factory orders and production), and the flurry of gloomy predictions from the IMF\u2019s Annual Meeting, do seem to have spooked traders. As Jonathan Sudaria, Capital Spreads trader, puts it: \u201cBad economic data is now being viewed as bad, and the dovish signals from central banks are now being taken as a sign of weakness rather than a reason to ramp up equities,\u201d Here are IG\u2019s opening calls: FTSE 6362: -69 points German DAX: 891,5 -90 points French CAC: 4097 -44 points Spanish IBEX: 10164 -109 points Italian MIB: 19183 -199 points Once again, October is turning into a volatile month in the markets. Also coming up today.... We\u2019ll get new industrial production data from France and Italy this morning, giving a new clue to the situation in the European economy. The latest UK trade data, showing Britain\u2019s balance of payments with the rest of the world, is due at 9.30am. And a stream of central bank policymakers will be speaking in Washington at the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank. And the Greek government is holding a confidence vote late tonight......",

    "webTitle": "Royal Mail birthday celebrations overshadowed by privatisation chaos", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Mail is poised to celebrate its first birthday as a public company after one of the most controversial privatisations in history. This time last year the government achieved its aim of selling off the 500-year-old national institution, which even Margaret Thatcher viewed as a privatisation too far, despite protests from staff, unions and politicians. On 11 October, the day of the flotation, Royal Mail shares soared by 38%, the biggest one-day rise in a privatisation since British Airways in 1987, as investors tried to buy more than 23 times the number of shares available. Despite the business secretary, Vince Cable, dismissing the initial price spike as \u201cfroth and speculation\u201d, the shares continued to climb to a peak of 618p \u2013 almost double the 330p float price \u2013 in January. Royal Mail shares were changing hands at 400p on FRiday. Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents more than 100,000 postal workers, on Friday said: \u201cThe botched privatisation of Royal Mail was a national scandal. Not only did the public not want it, but it was an unnecessary and costly process that left taxpayers \u00a31bn out of pocket. \u201cWe are already beginning to see the effects of the government\u2019s ill-thought privatisation firsthand, with the threat to the sustainability of the universal postal service.\u201d The National Audit Office ruled that the government\u2019s desperation to sell the postal service, which traces its roots to a forerunner set up by Henry VIII in 1516, had cost taxpayers at least \u00a3750m. The public spending watchdog said Cable had chosen not to heed repeated warnings from City experts that the government had vastly undervalued the company and refused to increase the flotation price. The government paid \u00a312.7m to financial institutions including Lazard, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Merrill Lynch as well as accountants, lawyers and PR consultants for their advice on the flotation. A further \u00a34.2m bonus, payable at the discretion of Cable, has been withheld. The investment bank Lazard, part of which advised the government that Royal Mail shares could be sold as cheaply as 212p, made an \u00a38.4m profit by immediately selling Royal Mail stock. The investment division, Lazard Asset Management, bought 6m shares at 330p each on the day of the float but sold them within 48 hours at 470p, reaping an \u00a38.4m profit. Margaret Hodge, chair of the parliamentary public accounts committee, said Lazard had \u201cmade a killing at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer that lost \u00a3750m on day one\u201d of Royal Mail\u2019s stock market debut. During the sale, Lazard\u2019s financial advisory division Lazard &amp; Co, which was paid \u00a31.5m by the government for flotation advice, valued Royal Mail shares at between 212p and 262p. Other banks valued the shares at up to 510p, with none of the syndicate banks deciding they were worth less than 300p. Hodge said: \u201cHow did you get it so wrong that it cost the taxpayer \u00a3750m on day one?\u201d. William Rucker, chief executive of Lazard &amp; Co, denied any wrongdoing. He said the two divisions of the bank were separated by Chinese walls and would not have been aware of what the other part was doing. Rucker pointed out that the \u00a38.4m profit was made on behalf of clients rather than for Lazard Asset Management itself. Lazard Asset Management was one of 16 investors awarded a priority status that allowed them to buy bigger chunks of Royal Mail \u2013 before the public \u2013 in the hope that they would remain with the company. However, six of the so-called long-term sustainable investors sold all of their shares almost immediately and a further six had sold most of their stake within weeks. Three of the investors given the \u201cgolden ticket\u201d status were revealed as aggressive hedge funds, despite the business secretary\u2019s pledge that Royal Mail would not fall into the hands of \u201cspivs and speculators\u201d. The hedge funds \u2013 Third Point, Och Ziff and George Soros\u2019s family fund \u2013 were allowed to buy millions of shares while hundreds of thousands of other people were limited to just \u00a3749 worth. Hodge said it felt wrong that a few in the City had \u201cmade a huge buck\u201d while the average taxpayer lost out. David Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said the initial share-price surge \u201cbrought all manner of career politicians who know little of life outside the Westminster bubble, let alone financial markets, to criticise the government for selling Royal Mail far too cheaply\u201d. \u201cMuch as I hate to defend politicians and particularly Vince Cable, he was right in saying that there was an awful lot of froth in the share price in the months after the IPO.\u201d Despite the government\u2019s repeated insistence that privatisation would not jeopardise rural deliveries, Royal Mail warned seven months later that its promise to deliver to every address in the country six days a week for the same price was under threat. The government still retains 30% of Royal Mail shares and has shown no desire to sell the remainder of its stake anytime soon.",

      "body": "<p>A revival of the eurozone crisis and the resilience of the Chinese economy are regarded by policymakers at the Bank of England as significant risks to financial stability.</p> <p>The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee cited these factors, alongside a concern that markets were mispricing risk, as it published its <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk//publications/Pages/Records/fpc/2014/1410.aspx\" title=\"\">quarterly assessment of the health of the financial system</a>.</p> <p>The members of the FPC, which is chaired by Bank of England governor Mark Carney, also revealed that they are to hold an extra meeting next week to discuss how much capital banks should hold when measured by the so-called leverage ratio. The leverage ratio, unlike other ways of measuring the financial health of banks, does not allow them to make judgments about whether some of their assets are riskier than others. The amount of capital they must hold as measured by the leverage ratio was published on 31 October.

      "bodyText": "A revival of the eurozone crisis and the resilience of the Chinese economy are regarded by policymakers at the Bank of England as significant risks to financial stability. The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee cited these factors, alongside a concern that markets were mispricing risk, as it published its quarterly assessment of the health of the financial system. The members of the FPC, which is chaired by Bank of England governor Mark Carney, also revealed that they are to hold an extra meeting next week to discuss how much capital banks should hold when measured by the so-called leverage ratio. The leverage ratio, unlike other ways of measuring the financial health of banks, does not allow them to make judgments about whether some of their assets are riskier than others. The amount of capital they must hold as measured by the leverage ratio was published on 31 October. It had not originally been scheduled until the middle of 2015. The committee, which was set up by the coalition in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, said it had discussed the risk of a prolonged period of very low euro-area inflation at its last meeting on 26 September. \u201cWeak growth and declines in headline inflation in the euro area were a particular source of concern,\u201d the FPC said. Banks have already cut their exposure to the eurozone in the wake of the crisis three years ago, but the committee said it \u201cwould continue to monitor developments in the euro area closely, including banks\u2019 direct and indirect exposures\u201d. The committee also revealed it was watching China. \u201cCommittee members remained concerned about the potential for financial stability threats to originate from China as it rebalanced towards a more domestic demand-driven economy. The Chinese housing market had been slowing and while annual credit growth had eased it remained close to 20%,\u201d the record of the latest meeting said. With the threat of fines looming over the industry \u2013 six big banks are said to be facing combined fines of \u00a31.8bn for rigging currency markets \u2013 the committee discussed the risks to financial stability posed by the size of the fines. The committee \u201cnoted increased uncertainty around some aspects of misconduct-related enforcement action, for instance those implemented by other national authorities, and a lack of clarity in some cases about the basis for computing fines and the severity of possible business activity restrictions.\u201d One member had warned about banks becoming more risk averse. \u201cOne member also noted that regulatory complexity and uncertainty more broadly, not just in relation to misconduct issues, were making banks increasingly risk averse, with potential implications for economic performance. Other members noted that greater risk aversion was an objective of the response to the financial crisis,\u201d the record said. The FPC also discussed whether it should require banks to hold an additional buffer of capital on top of the current regulatory minimum. It decided not to, but said it would review this in the last three months of the year after the results of the current stress tests being conducted by the large banks. The banks are being subjected to two health checks at the moment: one by the European Banking Authority, which is expected to publish the results on its tests of 100 eurozone lenders on 26 October, and one by the Bank of England, which is expected to be published before the end of the year. One of the factors banks need to know when assessing their financial strength is how much capital regulators will want them to hold when measured by a leverage ratio rather in terms of a more sophisticated capital ratio. The banks will learn the level at which the leverage ratio will be set as they report their third-quarter results in the next few weeks. It is currently set at 3%, but there is an expectation it could be raised, requiring banks to hold more capital than they do currently.",
