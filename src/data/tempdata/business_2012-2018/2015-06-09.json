In a wide-ranging analysis of Britain\u2019s performance in the decades before and after 1979, economists at the University of Cambridge say the liberal economic policies pioneered by Thatcher have been accompanied by higher unemployment and inequality. At the same time, contrary to widespread belief, GDP and productivity have grown more slowly since 1979 compared with the previous three decades. Liberal market policies such as lower tariffs and income taxes, free movement of labour, limited legal immunity for trade unions, privatisation and light-touch business regulation \u201cdid not produce the goods\u201d in terms of higher growth in GDP and productivity, according to Ken Coutts and Graham Gudgin at the Centre for Business Research at Cambridge Judge Business School. \u201cThose who believe in the free market economy must be able to show that economic performance after 1979 was better than it would have been under the \u2018corporatist\u2019 economic policies of earlier decades.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece is almost entirely friendless as it enters the final phase of talks over a multibillion-pound rescue deal. The prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, was elected to end austerity, but he has no money and few allies. Athens has tried for the last four months to reverse six years of post-crash austerity policies while extracting a better deal from the EU \u2013 and in the process has upset almost everybody who might have had the power and inclination to help. If Tsipras has any friends left in the eurozone, they are a diminishing bunch, and to be found mainly in Brussels rather than in the national capitals. Sympathy for the radical leftist Syriza-led government, which was never overwhelming, has shrunk sharply and turned into undisguised hostility. Greece owes \u20ac320bn (\u00a3234bn) to the European commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank following bailouts in 2010 and 2012. The troika of lenders insisted on a broad set of reforms and public spending cuts as the price for the loans under a programme that ran out in February and was extended until the end of June. Earlier this week, world leaders joined their EU counterparts to demand that Athens accept the need for painful sacrifices to secure further rescue funds. They hinted that by not agreeing to most of the existing demands, the economy could go bust and the country bundled out of the eurozone. This coordinated attack by the US president, Barack Obama, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, revealed a new resolve to face down the radicals and leftists in Athens. Tsipras, who leads a loose collection of socialists, communists and Trotskyists propelled into office on a wave of anti-austerity feeling, is running out of options. All the signs are now that he will be forced to accept during talks over the coming days much of what he rejected only last weekend as \u201cillogical\u201d. Last week, Athens delayed loan payments to the IMF and the Greek leader now has until the end of the month to negotiate a deal. But all the betting is that it will come sooner rather than risk a late scramble that in turn could trigger a bank run and an accidental \u201cGrexit\u201d. If opinion polls are to be believed, optimism is waning among the Greeks that Tsipras can secure a worthwhile compromise. Greeks want an end to austerity while remaining inside the eurozone. But the other 18 members of the currency bloc want Athens to accept that it cannot continue with its bloated public sector and generous pension system if new loans are to be forthcoming. Not that Syriza\u2019s support has declined since it won the election in January with 35% of the vote. It is this shift in public opinion and a unified front by creditors that prompted Tsipras to tell Syriza MPs on Tuesday that they must back whatever deal his negotiators secure. Any sense that the 70 members of the Left Platform faction within Syriza will vote against a deal is expected to force Tsipras to call a general election. The only chink in the creditors\u2019 resolve can be found in the European commission, the most dovish part of the troika. The previous commission, in office until last November, had been marginalised in the eurozone crisis and treated with contempt by the Germans and the French, which ran negotiations with Athens. Jean-Claude Juncker, the new commission chief, came into office determined to make himself a player on the Greece crisis and has used the ascent of Syriza to bolster that aim. The same applied to his monetary affairs commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, a French socialist, who has consistently taken a softer line on Greece. That relationship has gone sour, however, with Juncker accusing Tsipras at the weekend of lying to him and reneging on their agreements. Outside Brussels, Tsipras has no friends. The frustration with the Greeks has only grown over the past five months of talks that have rolled full circle to an impasse. Eastern European leaders in Slovakia, Slovenia or the Baltic have become increasingly critical and more outspoken about the Greeks, disinclined to listen to Greek complaints of pay cuts and denuded public services when they have gone through equally wrenching economic reforms themselves. The conservative Spanish government of Mariano Rajoy has grown increasingly hostile, not least because it is running scared of Syriza\u2019s lookalikes, Podemos, in domestic politics and ahead of elections in November. Critics of the Greek negotiating stance have argued that it was naive to believe that \u2013 even though austerity policies had failed to stabilise the economy or spur growth \u2013 mainstream eurozone politicians were likely to make a U-turn and hand political opponents in Greece a stunning political victory. Alexis Tsipras \u2013 the Greek leader He has gone back on almost every promise he made but even now Greece\u2019s youngest premier remains extraordinarily popular. The robust defence of Greece that his leftist-led government has put up since assuming power in January has restored a sense of pride at a time of extraordinary humiliation for the population. A civil engineering student who spent much of his college years organising sit-ins, the Greek prime minister is variously referred to by his friends as charming, charismatic and visionary. He plays good cop while his emissary, the finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, plays the bad boy. The leader\u2019s demagogic skills \u2013 and canniness on the political stage \u2013 are such that even opponents acknowledge he has made the best of a weak hand. The young leader has managed to pull off the extraordinary feat of cosying up to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, while accusing creditors of seeking a new deal that is \u201cillogical\u201d and \u201cabsurd\u201d. Panagiotis Lafazanis \u2013 the Greek rebel Pro-Russian, anti-capitalist and with a penchant for incendiary rhetoric, Lafazanis is widely perceived as Alexis Tsipras\u2019s greatest foe domestically. As head of Syriza\u2019s radical Left Platform, the 63-year-old hardliner rails frequently against the ills of neoliberalism and capitalism itself. Although he has softened his view on a euro exit \u2013 adopting, if hesitantly, the party\u2019s official stance that Athens must remain in the single currency \u2013 he has stepped up criticism of lenders, whom he has accused of trying to \u201ctear Greece apart\u201d. Ideologically unyielding, unpredictable and testy, Lafazanis, who is also energy minister \u2013 is likely to become more vocal in his opposition to policies being demanded of Greece. When it comes to a vote in parliament on a compromise deal, there is speculation that he will lead a revolt, forcing Tsipras to rely on moderate and rightwing parties to secure victory. Which is why Tsipras is considering a general election as a better way to keep his party together and resolve the dispute with Brussels. Yanis Varoufakis \u2013 the Greek finance minister Just when everyone thought Greece\u2019s maverick finance minister had been sidelined for good, Varoufakis is back, appearing as the public face of the anti-austerity government abroad. The rhetoric has been toned down \u2013 along with the dress code: he now leans more towards sombre suits than leather jacket. The Athens rumour mill says Tsipras is enormously dependent on the academic-turned politician \u2013 without doubt the government\u2019s most prominent public intellectual. The 54-year-old has exerted considerable influence on reining in Tsipras \u2013 and changing his views on the perils of eurozone exit. His purported expression of support for \u201c70% of the [troika\u2019s] reform proposals\u201d has earned him enemies in Syriza \u2013 a party he does not officially belong to. In talks with eurozone finance ministers and Brussels officials, tolerance has worn thin over his penchant for interminable lectures on the nature of capitalism and Europe\u2019s mistaken austerity experiment. Far from capitulating to a mix of charm and Keynesian economic theory, Brussels has stuck to its line: austerity is the only way. Manolis Glezos \u2013 the Greek conscience At 93, he is by far Europe\u2019s oldest MP, but age has not daunted Glezos nor his status as a legendary figurehead of the left. After playing a seminal role in Tsipras\u2019s political coming-of-age, the second world war hero who shot to fame tearing down the swastika from the Acropolis has led the cry of resistance to austerity in the European parliament. Universally respected, Glezos has openly criticised Syriza for making concessions \u2013 criticism that is bound to get louder in the weeks ahead. If the governing party strays too far from its pre-electoral mandate the sprightly white-haired nonagenarian will rally dissidents. Yannis Dragasakis \u2013 the righthand man A former Communist party MP, Dragasakis, 67, is the only minister to have previous experience in government. Outwardly mild-mannered, he hides a steely demeanour that should not be mistaken for capitulation. As deputy PM and the politician overseeing economic policy, this low-key player is the point man in negotiations with creditors. Although he believes that Greece has been stripped of its sovereignty after five years of stewardship under the EU and IMF, Dragasakis is the man who pulls the strings behind the scenes. A blackboard, depicting the (shifting) relationships between the various negotiating teams, has pride of place in his office. Euclid Tsakalotos \u2013 the negotiator Courteous and courtly, the British-educated Tsakalotos has won plaudits for taking the heat out of negotiations since becoming chief coordinator. Many see him as the perfect antidote to the outspoken Varoufakis. But, Tsakalotos, who studied economics at Oxford and has written several books, is not willing to compromise on what he regards as the \u201cirrational\u201d demands of creditors. A stickler for detail, the economics professor regards austerity as the breeding ground for the centrifugal forces that \u201cin a straight re-run of the 1930s\u201d could, he fears, tear Europe apart. He leads the talks with state minister Nikos Pappas, who is a close ally of Tsipras. Panos Kammenos \u2013 the coalition partner Leader of the Independent Greeks, Syriza\u2019s coalition partners, Panos Kammenos is a renowned populist. Anti-euro, anti-immigration and anti-German, one of his hobby horses is the need for Berlin to pay war reparations. Only last week a parliamentary committee backed claims that Germany should pay \u20ac279bn (\u00a3205bn) compensation for Nazi war atrocities. A former deputy shipping minister who broke away from the New Democracy party of the former prime minister Antonis Samaras in 2012, he has described the 2010 and 2012 financial bailouts as reducing Greece to the status of a debt colony. The Acropolis A symbol of the country\u2019s glorious past and of modern democracy, the Acropolis gives the Greek negotiating position huge moral strength. How, pro-Europeans ask, could Greece be ejected from the federalist single currency project and the eurozone still claim to be indivisible. The eurozone\u2019s image and its cohesion would be irreparably damaged should the Acropolis come to represent the failure of EU institutions and not their success, say many observers. Tsipras and Varoufakis have always aimed for a political deal born of a deep reluctance among the Brussels elite for letting go one of their children, even if Athens currently suffers from an oppositional disorder. The Greek people A general election is looming in Greece only six months after the last one as the new government in Athens is confronted by declining optimism in its ability to secure a good deal. In April a large majority of Greeks wanted Athens to reach a compromise deal with its foreign lenders to avoid being forced out of the eurozone. A poll found that 72% wanted an agreement with Greece\u2019s creditors, against 23% who said the government should refuse any compromise. A month later and support for a compromise had plummeted to 45%. But 75% still wanted to stay in the eurozone, while almost two in five support early elections to resolve the standoff over the cash-for-reforms deal. IMF/Brussels staff Plenty of senior insiders have quietly voiced support for the Greek negotiating position while rejecting the bull-in-a-china-shop negotiating tactics. Mostly, they concede that economic arguments put by Varoufakis \u2013 that austerity has made the situation worse and reforms will take time \u2013 are largely valid. In April, Poul Thomsen, head of the IMF\u2019s European department, became one of the few to openly voice his discontent at the stance taken by European finance ministers, who he said should reduce and simplify their demands on Greece. Angela Merkel Until recently the German leader followed the hard line established by her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. Now she stands accused of wavering in her resolve. Her critics suggest thather search for a peace deal with the radical leftists running Greece could be intended to be part of establishing a legacy. Alongside the potential division of Ukraine and the possibility of Britain quitting the European Union, a Grexit is something that must be averted to preserve her reputation as one of Germany\u2019s great chancellors. President Barack Obama The US has hardened its attitude to Greece over recent months. In February US Treasury staff were berating Brussels for failing to make concessions and wrap up a deal. Officials, concerned that jitters on international money markets would undermine business confidence and hit exports, were desperate for European policymakers to end austerity. Lately, the US has blamed Athens for much of the delay. In April, Obama met Varoufakis and brusquely informed him that he needed to stop lecturing Brussels and sign a deal. At the G7 summit on Monday, Obama said the Greeks needed to make sacrifices, \u201cnot only to satisfy creditors, but also to create a platform where the Greek economy can start growing again and prospering\u201d. He then gave Athens a clear nudge: \u201cThe Greeks are going to have to follow through and take some tough political choices that are going to be good in the long term.\u201d Enda Kenny The Irish prime minister was considered a natural ally by Varoufakis as he entered talks with Brussels back in February. Ireland was one of the three bust eurozone countries, with Portugal, to agree an EU/IMF rescue deal and remains buried under a mountain of debt. But unlike Greece, the centre-right coalition led by Kenny has secured a sustained period of growth, mostly through higher exports. Like Spain and Portugal, Ireland\u2019s ruling coalition fears a Syriza-style challenge from the left. In the Republic that means Sinn F\u00e9in. In Spain, which continues to suffer high unemployment and huge private indebtedness, Podemos is a challenger in November elections. Jeroen Dijsselbloem The Dutch finance minister, who made the mistake of travelling to Athens shortly after Tsipras took power only to be lambasted by Varoufakis, has a deep antipathy to the Syriza plan to reschedule, or if possible write down, its debts. That first meeting with Varoufakis framed Dijsselbloem\u2019s hostility, which has never faded, although he is now more circumspect about articulating it. A mild-mannered Labour MP, he was transformed into a hardliner seeking detailed commitments from Athens for reform. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble The German finance minister and prominent Christian Democrat has worn his political colours on his sleeve, objecting to virtually all concessions to the new Greek government. Recently he accused the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, of mendacity and reiterated that Greece\u2019s debt problems lay squarely with the fact that the Mediterranean nation had lived far beyond its means. At the time he said: \u201cThe new Greek government has totally destroyed the trust of its European partners \u2026 this is a serious setback.\u201d An architect of German reunification, the veteran eurocrat has begun to appear more relaxed as Varoufakis has upset one euro finance minister after another, consolidating the German position that Greece must stick to the austerity plan. Jean-Claude Juncker A peripheral figure during debt talks with Greece only a few months ago, the calm and diplomatic Juncker has moved centre stage. To use a football analogy, he was given the task during the G7 conference in Dresden of man-marking Tsipras. And as any defender will tell you, man-marking is a frustrating occupation. On Sunday Juncker was visibly angry. He was told to expect a redrafted compromise memo from Athens. He said: \u201cAlexis Tsipras promised that by Thursday evening he would present a second proposal. Then he said he would present it on Friday. \u201cAnd then he said he would call on Saturday. But I have never received that proposal, so I hope I will receive it soon. I would like to have that Greek proposal.\u201d The former prime minister of Luxembourg is sure to be all smiles when Tsipras returns to the negotiating table, though he is unlikely to be handed a revised draft until near the end of the month. Christine Lagarde The boss of the IMF has appeared to flip-flop lately after a return to espousing neoliberal policies of labour market reform and privatisations as a means to rebuilding the Greek government\u2019s finances. Only a few months ago she adopted a more conciliatory tone, scaling down the demands made on Athens and talking up an extension of the current bailout. As one of three major lenders, the organisation has admitted it made a major mistake when Greece defaulted for a second time in 2012, when it replaced Athens\u2019 private-sector borrowing with its own loans, pushing up the overall debt burden. Mario Draghi The attitude of the president of the European Central Bank was partly formed by the way his officials were treated in Athens. At a late-night session in Brussels a couple of months ago, he read Tsipras the riot act, demanding respect and cooperation after his team in Athens was confined to its hotel, refused access to Greek ministries, and required bodyguards when faced with aggressive protesters. More recently, in his capacity as head of one third of the troika of lenders, he has supplied Greek banks with much-needed loans to prevent them falling over while talks continue. Vladimir Putin It is only a couple of weeks since the Russian president took yet another opportunity to foment unrest inside the eurozone by promising a better life for Greece outside the eurozone. He welcomed Tsipras to Moscow a few weeks ago and hinted at aid for Greece should it leave the currency union. He has a war chest from years of oil tax receipts and would be happy to offer guarantees and loans for a deal that would upset Berlin and Washington, despite a domestic recession and the clamour from struggling state enterprises for extra cash. Greece is also a key Nato member and has a large army, which Putin would enjoy drawing closer to his sphere of influence. There are also ties via Cyprus, where Russian oligarchs stashed large sums of cash and then found themselves vulnerable when the island declared itself bust.",

      "body": "<p>Greece is almost entirely friendless as it enters the final phase of talks over a multibillion-pound rescue deal. The prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, was elected to end austerity, but he has no money and few allies.</p> <p>Athens has tried for the last four months to reverse six years of post-crash austerity policies while extracting a better deal from the EU \u2013 and in the process has upset almost everybody who might have had the power and inclination to help.</p> <p>If Tsipras has any friends left in the eurozone, they are a diminishing bunch, and to be found mainly in Brussels rather than in the national capitals. Sympathy for the radical leftist Syriza-led government, which was never overwhelming, has shrunk sharply and turned into undisguised hostility.</p> <p>Greece owes \u20ac320bn (\u00a3234bn) to the European commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank following bailouts in 2010 and 2012. The troika of lenders insisted on a broad set of reforms and public spending cuts as the price for the loans under a programme that ran out in February and was extended until the end of June.</p> <p>Earlier this week, world leaders joined their EU counterparts to demand that Athens accept the need for painful sacrifices to secure further rescue funds. They hinted that by not agreeing to most of the existing demands, the economy could go bust and the country bundled out of the eurozone.</p> <p>This coordinated attack by the US president, Barack Obama, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, revealed a new resolve to face down the radicals and leftists in Athens.</p> <p>Tsipras, who leads a loose collection of socialists, communists and Trotskyists propelled into office on a wave of anti-austerity feeling, is running out of options. All the signs are now that he will be forced to accept during talks over the coming days much of what he rejected only last weekend as \u201cillogical\u201d.</p> <p>Last week, Athens delayed loan payments to the IMF and the Greek leader now has until the end of the month to negotiate a deal. But all the betting is that it will come sooner rather than risk a late scramble that in turn could trigger a bank run and an accidental \u201cGrexit\u201d.</p> <p>If opinion polls are to be believed, optimism is waning among the Greeks that Tsipras can secure a worthwhile compromise. Greeks want an end to austerity while remaining inside the eurozone. But the other 18 members of the currency bloc want Athens to accept that it cannot continue with its bloated public sector and generous pension system if new loans are to be forthcoming. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/03/100-days-of-solitude-syriza-struggles-as-greeks-once-again-stare-into-the-abyss\">Not that Syriza\u2019s support has declined since it won the election</a> in January with 35% of the vote.</p> <p>It is this shift in public opinion and a unified front by creditors that prompted Tsipras to tell Syriza MPs on Tuesday that they must back whatever deal his negotiators secure. Any sense that the 70 members of the Left Platform faction within Syriza will vote against a deal is expected to force Tsipras to call a general election.</p> <p>The only chink in the creditors\u2019 resolve can be found in the European commission, the most dovish part of the troika. The previous commission, in office until last November, had been marginalised in the eurozone crisis and treated with contempt by the Germans and the French, which ran negotiations with Athens.</p> <p>Jean-Claude Juncker, the new commission chief, came into office determined to make himself a player on the Greece crisis and has used the ascent of Syriza to bolster that aim. The same applied to his monetary affairs commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, a French socialist, who has consistently taken a softer line on Greece.</p> <p>That relationship has gone sour, however, with Juncker accusing Tsipras at the weekend of lying to him and reneging on their agreements.</p> <p>Outside Brussels, Tsipras has no friends. The frustration with the Greeks has only grown over the past five months of talks that have rolled full circle to an impasse.</p> <p>Eastern European leaders in Slovakia, Slovenia or the Baltic have become increasingly critical and more outspoken about the Greeks, disinclined to listen to Greek complaints of pay cuts and denuded public services when they have gone through equally wrenching economic reforms themselves.</p> <p>The conservative Spanish government of Mariano Rajoy has grown increasingly hostile, not least because it is running scared of Syriza\u2019s lookalikes, Podemos, in domestic politics and ahead of elections in November.</p> <p>Critics of the Greek negotiating stance have argued that it was naive to believe that \u2013 even though austerity policies had failed to stabilise the economy or spur growth \u2013 mainstream eurozone politicians were likely to make a U-turn and hand political opponents in Greece a stunning political victory.</p> <h2>Alexis Tsipras \u2013 the Greek leader </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d5396162146e0f1192cef20f5ba569766c8c84bc\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433874889318/62df2d2c-c37d-4fdb-ab6e-b86087fe7f19-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Greek prime minister and leader of Syriza.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He has gone back on almost every promise he made but even now Greece\u2019s youngest premier remains extraordinarily popular. </p> <p>The robust defence of Greece that his leftist-led government has put up since assuming power in January has restored a sense of pride at a time of extraordinary humiliation for the population. </p> <p>A civil engineering student who spent much of his college years organising sit-ins, the Greek prime minister is variously referred to by his friends as charming, charismatic and visionary. He plays good cop while his emissary, the finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, plays the bad boy.

Ideologically unyielding, unpredictable and testy, Lafazanis, who is also energy minister \u2013 is likely to become more vocal in his opposition to policies being demanded of Greece. </p> <p>When it comes to a vote in parliament on a compromise deal, there is speculation that he will lead a revolt, forcing Tsipras to rely on moderate and rightwing parties to secure victory. Which is why Tsipras is considering a general election as a better way to keep his party together and resolve the dispute with Brussels.</p> <h2>Yanis Varoufakis \u2013 the Greek finance minister</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f0156c518e2f1db393d11baf4f2fb305a1d93ecc\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433876333581/f2aa23da-742a-4466-befe-777c21cd40e5-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Yanis Varoufakis\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Academic-turned politician Yanis Varoufakis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yannis Kolesidis/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just when everyone thought Greece\u2019s maverick finance minister had been sidelined for good, Varoufakis is back, appearing as the public face of the anti-austerity government abroad. </p> <p>The rhetoric has been toned down \u2013 along with the dress code: he now leans more towards sombre suits than leather jacket. The Athens rumour mill says Tsipras is enormously dependent on the academic-turned politician \u2013 without doubt the government\u2019s most prominent public intellectual. </p> <p>The 54-year-old has exerted considerable influence on reining in Tsipras \u2013 and changing his views on the perils of eurozone exit. His purported expression of support for \u201c70% of the [troika\u2019s] reform proposals\u201d has earned him enemies in Syriza \u2013 a party he does not officially belong to. </p> <p>In talks with eurozone finance ministers and Brussels officials, tolerance has worn thin over his penchant for interminable lectures on the nature of capitalism and Europe\u2019s mistaken austerity experiment.

But possibly not Jean-Claude Juncker, who doesn\u2019t sound especially calm right now. Cheers, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Even the most sensationalist hack would struggle to get excited about Wall Street tonight. The Dow Jones index fell a mere 0.01%, while the broader S&amp;P 500 gained a single point. Greece\u2019s predicament clearly isn\u2019t worrying New York. Volker Kauder, caucus leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s bloc in parliament, has also shown impatience with Greece\u2019s strategy tonight. Kauder said: \u201cIt\u2019s not possible that the borrower decides under what conditions the lender kindly gives his money,\u201d \u201cWe want Greece to stay in the euro, but whether this is achievable depends entirely on Greece.\u201d That\u2019s via Bloomberg. More here: New Greek Budget Plan Falls Short of Last Week\u2019s Pledge Greece may have burned its bridges with Jean-Claude Juncker too! As we flagged up earlier, Juncker has been cool about meeting Alexis Tsipras at Wednesday\u2019s summit. And AFP has learned that the EC president has been telling colleagues that it\u2019s not worth the effort. Juncker told fellow European commissioners on Tuesday that a new Tsipras meeting would be a \u201cwaste of time\u201d and that it would be \u201cbetter to meet with the Latin Americans\u201d, an EU source said. Was it just another day in the Greek crisis -- with Athens submitting proposals, creditors saying more work is needed, and the roundabout spinning again? Perhaps not. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel reports tonight that the cautious optimism in Brussels is being replaced by \u201cfear and suspicion\u201d. That\u2019s despite Greece proposing more taxing budget surplus targets - moving halfway towards its old bailout targets. So is Greece misplaying its hand? Over to Peter...... Gone this time were the private reassurances that a deal would ultimately be concluded, allowing the Greek government to receive an infusion of euros before its bailout expires at the end of the month. Instead, officials from various institutions involved in the talks now worry that Greece\u2019s hard-left government is dangerously miscalculating. Athens, they believe, is intentionally prolonging the negotiations to the last minute in a belief that its creditors will eventually \u201cblink\u201d and agree to grant wholesale debt relief and new bailout cash with few strings attached. \u201cThey do not want a deal with us; they just want debt relief,\u201d a senior official with one of Athens\u2019 bailout monitors said after reviewing Greece\u2019s latest offer. \u201cI don\u2019t think they will move. I think they\u2019re waiting for us to blink, and we won\u2019t,\u201d the official added. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand we\u2019re not back in 2012 where the Europeans were willing to just throw money at the problem.\u201d Full story: \u2018Paperology\u2019 continues, but mood darkens in Greece talks Some Greek MPs are pushing Alexis Tsipras to hold firm: Correction! London\u2019s stock market actually fell to a three-month low tonight: Fortunately my colleague Nick Fletcher knows the score: Leading shares hit a near three month low, on continuing worries about Greece, rising bond yields and talk of a US rate rise. In a broad based sell-off the FTSE 100 fell 36.24 points to 6753.80, its lowest level since 13 March. European markets were also lower, with Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.7% and France\u2019s Cac falling 0.19%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up around 25 points by the time London closed, as better than expected job openings figures added to Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers to ease concerns about weakness in the US economy. But gains were limited, since a strong economy inevitably suggests to investors a probable rise in interest rates this year.... More here: It was a day to forget on the Frankfurt stock market, where the Dax lost another 0.55% (the white line on this chart). Money also flooded out of German government debt as the QE factor faded, pushing yields on 10-year bunds up to nearly 1% (the yellow line above) Is the EU Commission president still fuming, after hearing his efforts savaged in the Athens parliament on Friday? According to officials cited in the Greek media, he may well be, writes Helena Smith. Athens has still not heard whether Jean-Claude Juncker will be present when Alexis Tsipras holds talks on the sidelines of Wednesday\u2019s EU-Latin American and Carribean summit with his French and German counterparts. Still, the Greek leader appears to be preparing the ground for a solution - among his own rank and file. Speaking to Syriza\u2019s political secretariat - the party\u2019s steering board - he said every last MP had to support the government\u2019s proposal because it outlined \u201ca viable solution\u201d to the country\u2019s economic woes. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EC vice-president with responsibility for the euro, believes a Greek deal can be reached in the coming days. He told a press conference in Brussels that a staff-level accord could be close, if primary surplus targets are \u2018specific measures\u2019 are agreed. But Dombrovskis, who has been fairly firm with Greece in recent months, also warned that the \u201ctactical manoeuvring\u201d must stop. EU\u2019S DOMBROVSKIS SAYS: IMPORTANT IN COMING DAYS TO AGREE ON PRIMARY SURPLUS TARGETS AND SPECIFIC MEASURES FOR GREECE EU\u2019S DOMBROVSKIS SAYS: IS IMPORTANT FOR GREECE TO SAY WHAT MEASURES THEY DON\u2019T LIKE AND WHAT THEY ARE READY TO DO EU\u2019S DOMBROVSKIS SAYS: REACHING AGREEMENT IN COMING DAYS IS POSSIBLE EU\u2019S DOMBROVSKIS SAYS: NEEDS LESS TACTICAL MANOEUVRING AND MORE WORK ON SUBSTANCE Wolfango Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence reckons Greece will be forced into a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d deal by its creditors in time for the next Eurogroup meeting, on 18 June. By that stage, Tsipras would have to swallow pension reforms, as the only alternative will be capital controls. Wolf adds: In this sense, rumours that the revised Greek proposal constitutes no substantial improvement are not particularly surprising. Wolf has also summarised the latest Greek negotiating position, based on today\u2019s leaks: Primary surplus: Greece wants the targets (1% in 2015 and 2% in 2016) lowered (to 0.75% in 2015, 1.75% in 2016, and 2.5% in 2017) but this remains unlikely as it would open up again the question of debt sustainability. Moreover, the proposed measures are deemed by the creditor as not sufficient to meet to targets indicated by Athens. While creditors might show some flexibility on the target for 2015, they are likely to be less forthcoming regarding 2016-18. VAT: Athens may be willing to give up exemptions for the Aegean islands (worth about \u20ac300m), increasing their offer to around \u20ac1.3bn. Ultimately, Athens will likely have to accept the Troika proposal of revenues of around \u20ac1.5-1.8bn, as long as electricity is excluded from the top rate. Pensions: This remains the major sticking point. Athens offered to scrap early retirement incentives and to increase health contributions of pensions but wants to keep the EKAS benefit for low-income pensioners. The question is whether the Government will commit to cumulative savings target by end 2016 of 1% of GDP. OECD toolkit on product market deregulation: The IMF insists on passing the reforms not yet implemented by the previous government (over-the-counter drugs, milk, advertising). If Athens delivers, it may get some flexibility on pensions. But SYRIZA once railed against the OECD recommendations, and resistance from vested interests is strong. Privatisation: Creditors insist on privatizations in the energy sector with the sale of ADMIE (the independent power transmission operator), PPC (or at least a small part of it), and ELPE (Hellenic Petroleum) \u2013 all of which are under the supervision of Energy/Environment Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, the leader of SYRIZA\u2019s leftist platform. Newsflashes from Athens - Alexis Tsipras has met with top members of his Syriza party, and urged them to support him at this critical time. Tsipras, who looked quite relaxed arriving at the meeting (is that a new jacket?) also told MPs that he is not planning to call fresh elections: That\u2019s via a government official, speaking to Reuters: 09-Jun-2015 15:15:53 - GREEK PM TSIPRAS TELLS HIS PARTY\u2019S POLITICAL COMMITTEE NEGOTIATIONS WITH LENDERS ARE AT MOST CRUCIAL STAGE, CALLS ON PARTY TO SUPPORT HIM - GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL 09-Jun-2015 15:16:16 - GREEK PM TSIPRAS TELLS HIS PARTY\u2019S POLITICAL COMMITTEE HE IS NOT CONSIDERING EARLY ELECTIONS As regular readers know, a section of Syriza are adamant that Tsipras should not compromise, and should instead seek a \u2018rupture\u2019 from its creditors. It must be time for a recap. Greece has submitted fresh proposals to its creditors in an attempt to secure fresh bailout funding before its current programme expires in three weeks time. But talks are continuing in Brussels this afternoon, after EU officials warned this new list still doesn\u2019t go far enough. Three pages of new fiscal plans were delivered to Brussels officials this morning, including higher budget surplus targets. Greece has also outlined plans to cut its debt burden, partly by getting Europe\u2019s bailout fund to buy Greek bonds held by the ECB which mature in July and August. The Greek government says: \u201cTwo complimentary texts of proposals were handed over to the commissioner Pierre Moscovici, with the aim of closing the fiscal gap with alternative proposals and coming up with a possible plan of sustainability for the Greek debt.\u201d Officially, the EC says it is considering the plan with \u201cdiligence and care\u201d. But behind the scenes, officials didn\u2019t take long to dismiss this latest proposal. Reuters explains: \u201cWhat has been submitted is not sufficient to move the process forward,\u201d said one EU official. Another said it was \u201cnot sufficient and not acceptable to member states\u201d. Talks between the two sides are expected to continue today. And Greece has a great incentive to make progress: Insiders saying Alexis Tsipras will present his government\u2019s updated proposal to Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande tomorrow, when he meets the two leaders on the sidelines of the EU/ Latin America summit. There\u2019s a lot of speculation that Greece could be given a new bailout extension, to March 2016. The WSJ says creditors proposed this last week. And Athens insiders say it would give time to agree a third bailout early next year. One told our Helena Smith : \u201cThat would be the time that the government would have to come to a big agreement.\u201d But that would require billions of fresh funding - perhaps by repurposing \u20ac10.9bn of bank recapitalisation funds. And Tsipras is sticking to his \u2018red lines\u2019. He criticised lenders for demanding more austerity to be poured on Greece\u2019s poorest, in an interview with Italy\u2019s Corriere Della Sera. And the PM also claimed that the eurozone could collapse if Greece were forced out, raising the stakes ahead of Wednesday\u2019s meeting. He said: It would be the beginning of the end of the eurozone. If the European political leadership cannot handle a problem like that of Greece, which accounts for 2% of its economy, what would the reaction of the markets be to countries facing much larger problems, such as Spain or Italy which has two trillion of public debt? Italy\u2019s finance minister has rejected this idea, though, telling CNBC that the eurozone is stronger than it was before. And Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has said Athens needs to do more: Sch\u00e4uble says he still disagrees with Yanis Varoufakis, having met his Greek counterpart on Monday And he also has denied falling out with Angela Merkel over her handling of the Greek crisis, insisting: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t waste much time on these rumours.\u201d Not that Greece has much time to waste on anything right now.... Some afternoon reading. Andrew Farlow, research fellow in economics at Oriel College, Oxford, has outlined how Greece\u2019s unsustainably debts have been created by the flawed structure of the eurozone, which encouraged the flow of cheap credit from German and French banks to the periphery. Those claims can\u2019t be repaid, so politicians must \u201cend the pretence\u201d and be open about the debt relief Greece needs. Here\u2019s a flavour: At first, the German people welcomed the artificial upside of the euro, and passed the systemic risk consequences on to countries like Greece. Now, as the prospects for Greece worsen and the euro becomes more depressed, Germany\u2019s exports receive a boost, and Germans become even less sympathetic. Meanwhile, all those panic-driven flows of capital flooding back into Germany have pushed ten-year German bond rates from about 3% in early 2011 to nearly zero today, easing Germany\u2019s own budget problems. No wonder its politicians have been disinclined to spell out the optimal loss-mitigation strategy for Germany and the eurozone. The stark reality is that Greece\u2019s creditors must choose between two unpalatable scenarios. One is that Greece will leave the euro and default on its euro-denominated debt, its creditors will not get repaid anyway, and costly speculative pressures will mount on Portugal, Spain and Italy, while Greece itself will become more unstable politically and economically. The alternative is that Greece will stay, and its creditors will have to allow some further write-down on Greek debt. The latter scenario is surely the less painful. Reforms in Greece need to go hand in hand with debt write-downs \u2013 not because of any special virtues of Greece, but because the logic of the euro makes it the only sane way out. Those who led the country into its mess are largely discredited within Greece. It has made huge progress in shifting its primary fiscal balance (i.e. before interest) and its structural fiscal deficit towards surplus. Further reforms now need growth, and this will only happen if economic bygones are treated as bygones. Italy\u2019s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, has rejected Alexis Tsipras\u2019s claim today that the eurozone would eventually collapse if Greece left. Speaking on CNBC a moment ago, Padoan said the EU system was much stronger than before. He\u2019s still confident that a Greek deal will come in time, he adds. Sch\u00e4uble has also denied reports of a rift with Angela Merkel over Greece. Don\u2019t waste your time with such rumours, he insists. Last week, German media claimed that the two politicians were divided over Greece, with Merkel determined to avoid Grexit and Sch\u00e4uble arguing that stretching the rules for Athens would simply be too dangerous. Bloomberg reported this morning that the split was widening as the Greece crisis goes down to the wire. Over in Berlin, Germany\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is telling reporters that he still disagrees with his Greek counterpart, Yanis Varoufakis, on some issues despite yesterday\u2019s meeting. Via Reuters: GERMAN FIN MIN SCHAEUBLE SAYS AFTER TALKS WITH GREECE\u2019S VAROUFAKIS ON MONDAY WE STILL HAVE DIFFERING VIEWS I guess we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the Marxist economist and the centre-right politician don\u2019t quite see the world the same way. Schauble is speaking alongside Alex Stubb, Finland\u2019s finance minister (and ex-PM). Stubb is taking a firm line too, warning that Greece needs to do its share to resolve the crisis before Europe runs out of patience: FINNISH FINANCE MINISTER STUBB SAYS IN LAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO KEEP GREECE IN EURO ZONE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT BUT IT IS A TWO-WAY STREET Dow Jones newswires have some firm details of Greece\u2019s new proposal. It confirms that Athens has promised tougher budget targets - but still not as stretching as the creditors want. Greece is now offering to run a primary surplus (excluding debt payments) of 0.75% this year. Up from 0.6% before, but below the creditors 1% goal. Next year\u2019s target has been raised from 1% to 1.75%, halfway to the creditors\u2019 aim for 2.5%. (corrected) Then in 2017, Greece is offering 2.5%, up from its earlier offer of 2%. Creditors want 3% though. We shouldn\u2019t blame Greece entirely for the moves in the markets today. Mining stocks were hit by weak Chinese inflation data released overnight, and there are also worries that the US Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates in September. Greece\u2019s stock market is defying the selloff; The Athens ATG index is up 2% today. Fears over Greece have pushed Europe\u2019s stock markets lower through the morning. All the main indices are in the red, with the Stoxx Europe 600 hitting its lowest level since 20 February (later that night, Greece\u2019s four-month bailout extension was agreed). The German DAX has now dropped around 11% since hitting its record high in April, as the enthusiasm created by the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus programme fades. David Madden, market analyst at IG, pins some of the blame on Greece. The London market is somewhat sheltered from the uncertainty in the eurozone, but whenever there is a decline in continental Europe the British market isn\u2019t far behind. The value that was added to eurozone stock markets on the back of QE is quickly being eroded due to Greece, and with the payback deadline looming dealers are doing their utmost to get out. Greece\u2019s short-term debt is under pressure this morning, pushing the yield (or interest rate) on two-year bonds up from 24.9% to 25.1%. That suggests the debt is seen as even riskier. Reuters is now also reporting that Greece hasn\u2019t gone far enough for Europe\u2019s liking: 12:22:08 - NEW GREEK REFORM PROPOSAL IN CASH-FOR-REFORM TALKS IS NOT SUFFICIENT -- EU OFFICIALS Greek officials insist that their team in Brussels have narrowed the gap over fiscal targets and reforms with creditors. That convergence follows the arrival of minister of state Nikos Pappas, prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 closest ally, in Brussels on Monday, leading to today\u2019s new proposals. Helena Smith reports from Athens: After the flare-up of tensions following what many perceived as Tsipras\u2019 incendiary speech before parliament on Friday, Pappas flew to Brussels on Monday to smooth ruffled feathers. Accompanied by Euclid Tsakalotos, the Oxford-educated economist coordinating negotiations and George Chouliarakis, the Manchester University academic heading the Greek government\u2019s negotiating team, the three (moderates) held talks with EU economic and monetary affairs commissioner, Pierre Moscovici. The contours of the proposal released today are believed to have been hotly debated at the meeting. The major discrepancy over just how big the fiscal gap will be in 2015-2106 appears to have been closed. Until now Athens has forecast that indebtedness will stand at around \u20ac2bn; lenders at the EU, ECB and IMF reckon it will be more than twice that amount at around \u20ac4.5bn. But sources are reporting convergence between the two sides over revenue projections that would close the gap. However...the issue of VAT (which lenders want to increase to 23%) is still a huge bone of contention, as it could hurt tourism. The tourist industry \u2013 the lifeblood of the Greek economy at this difficult time \u2013 is up in arms. The measure has been tired and tested and deemed a huge failure. When imposed back in 2011, tax evasion shot up, more than 100,000 enterprises were forced to close and unemployment skyrocketed. \u201cIt would be a catastrophe for the one sector that is doing well,\u201d Greece\u2019s tourism chief Andreas Andreadis told me. \u201cThey say tourism must pay its share but all across Europe VAT rates are so much lower,\u201d he said adding that the country would lose its competitive edge in the one area that is now so vital to keeping it afloat. The Greek government has just issued one of its famous non-papers confirming that it has indeed delivered an updated version of its proposals, in an attempt to \u201cclose the gap\u201d with creditors. Here\u2019s the statement (via Helena Smith): \u201cThe Greek government after the expression of opposition to the proposal [made by] the institutions by all the Greek parties is continuing negotiations on a political level on the basis of the proposal that it has given them. \u201cTwo complimentary texts of proposals were handed over to the commissioner Pierre Moscovici, with the aim of closing the fiscal gap with alternative proposals and coming up with a possible plan of sustainability for the Greek debt.\u201d \u201cThe Greek government will continue this exchange of views with the institutions on a political level and awaits with interest their formal response.\u201d Another Brussels insider has rubbished Greece\u2019s latest proposal, to German TV journalist Stefan Leifert. Over in Brussels, European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas has been fielding a lot of questions from the press pack about the Greek bailout talks. Schinas confirms that Greece has indeed submitted new proposals. They are now being circulated among the institutions, he says, and being assessed \u201cwith diligence and care.\u201d He\u2019s reluctant to commit much more, though, at this stage. Is the Commission now looking at a new programme for Greece, as well as the current bailout (which expires on 30 June)? The Commission continue to work on the framework of the Eurogroup statement of 20 February, Schinas replies, suggesting they are still only working on the current deal. What meeting will take place today? Contacts should obviously continue at both political and technical level, says Schinas But he cannot confirm any other meeting. And might Jean-Claude Juncker meet Alexis Tsipras tomorrow, when leaders gather for the EU summit? Before we get into tomorrow, let\u2019s get into today, pleads Schinas. We need to assess these new proposals first. Journalists in Athens are being briefed that two documents have indeed been drawn up, and handed to European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici. One covers fiscal issues. The second outlines Greece\u2019s plan for achieve debt sustainability. And together they\u2019re Greece\u2019s latest attempt to reach a compromise. We still don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s in the two Greek proposals, but Bloomberg is reporting that one EU official has already claimed it doesn\u2019t go far enough it. Their Athens bureau chief, Nikos Chrysoloras, reports: The Greek government submitted a three-page budget proposal to its creditors in Brussels in a bid to unlock bailout funds, two international officials with direct knowledge of the discussions said. The document covered only fiscal targets, one of the people said. Greece gave its creditors a separate note, also three pages long, on how to address the country\u2019s financing needs, in which the government asked to use funds from the European Stability Mechanism to repay about \u20ac6.7bn ($7.6bn) of bonds held by the European Central Bank that come due in July and August, the people said. One of the officials said the revised Greek plan is a vague rehash of earlier proposals and is still not considered credible. The second official said the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund are assessing the plan, which was received this morning. Both asked not to be named, as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter....(more here) Austria\u2019s finance minister, Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling, has warned Greece not to expect any slack from its lenders. Schelling said (via Reuters): \u201cI believe that the institutions and creditors have made so many concessions to the Greeks that I cannot imagine that there can be further concessions.\u201d More data....and Eurostat has confirmed that the eurozone economy grew by 0.4% in the first three months of this year. That\u2019s faster than the UK (+0.3%) and the US (which contracted almost 0.2% quarter-on-quarter). But Greece missed the recovery -- falling back into recession during the quarter. Eurostat explains: Among Member States for which data are available for the first quarter of 2015, the Czech Republic (+3.1%), Cyprus and Romania (both +1.6%) recorded the highest growth compared with the previous quarter, followed by Poland (+1.0%), Bulgaria and Spain (both +0.9%), Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia (all +0.8%). Decreases were registered in Lithuania (-0.6%), Estonia (-0.3%), Greece (-0.2%) and Finland (-0.1%). Britain\u2019s trade gap has hit the lowest level in 13 months. The total trade deficit dipped to \u00a31.2bn in April, from nearly \u00a33.1bn in March. That suggests net trade could be a smaller drag on growth. The figure included a 23% jump in exports to the US, due to higher sales of chemicals and machinery. But eurozone exports only rose by 0.6%; the strong pound may be holding back net trade. Reality check. An EU official has just told Bloomberg that this new proposal is a \u201cvague rehash\u201d of earlier Greek plans, and questioning how credible it is. Kathimerini was reporting last night that Athens was proposing to raise VAT rates a little, but keep the 7% lowest rate. And it was prepared to offer a higher primary surplus target this year, nearer to the creditors\u2019 1% target. But little change on pensions (something Alexis Tsipras dubbed \u201cinconceivable\u201d in this morning\u2019s interview with Corriere Della Sera). Make that a seven-page proposal -- broadly split between proposed measures, and plans to cover Greece\u2019s funding problems over the coming months. Quite a reduction from the 47-page list of measures which Athens submitted last week. Shares are rallying in Athens on hopes of a breakthrough. The ATG index has jumped almost 3%, even though we don\u2019t know what\u2019s in this new proposal, or whether it closes the gap with creditors. Over in Athens, there is much talk that a deal that would extend the country\u2019s bailout programme until the autumn (at the very least) is now seriously being pondered (as the Wall Street Journal reported last night) Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Insiders are saying the new name of the game is extension \u2013 possibly through to March 2016 when the International Monetary Fund\u2019s participation in Greece\u2019s bailout program officially expires, or certainly into the fall. Both would allow the leftist government to properly prepare for what everyone is now calling the \u201cbig agreement\u201d \u2013 a third bailout of between \u20ac40bn to \u20ac50bn that Athens undoubtedly needs to survive economically in the coming years. The idea of an extension, first reported in this blog on May 21st, has been floated at the highest level of German policy making for some time now, according to Greek insiders. Sources saying there simply isn\u2019t enough time now to come to a credible agreement that will stick. The only condition are reforms (or at least a persuasive promise of reforms) that would overhaul an economy on its deathbed. \u201cAfter the summer we don\u2019t have any big [debt] payments until March 2016, which in effect would be crunch time,\u201d said one well-placed source who requested anonymity simply because speculation is now running so high. \u201cThat would be the time that the government would have to come to a big agreement.\u201d Almost everything at this moment rests in the hands of prime minister Alexis Tsipras and which way he wants to go. An extension would buy him time \u2013 and give the radical left leader some wiggle room to deal with his Syriza party\u2019s hard left faction. Even if a \u201cshort-term\u201d deal is eventually clinched, as it is expected to be in the coming days, the anti-austerity government will face enormous difficulties. The agreement will need to be approved by the governing party, passed by the 300-seat parliament, legislated and then implemented. \u201cIt would be impossible to enforce with the current cabinet,\u201d Andreas Papadopoulos, a former spokesman with the small Democratic Left party, told state-run TV this morning. \u201cTsipras would need to change his cabinet make-up,\u201d he said, insisting that disagreement on an ideological basis was so profound many of the reforms could never pass. That might explain why the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis also insisted in comments relayed this morning that any deal would have to be a permanent deal. Varoufakis told the Athens News agency: \u201cThe Greek government wants an agreement-solution. It wants this to be the last negotiation. The Greek people deserved it.\u201d Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, confirms that the idea of swapping existing Greek debt held at the European Central Bank for new bailout loans isn\u2019t new. It all depends what Greece is offering in return... Over to Reuters for details of this morning\u2019s key development. The European Commission has received a new proposal from Greece for reforms that could unlock new funding from the cash-strapped country and is now assessing it, an EU official said on Tuesday. The proposal was originally due last Thursday. It is to bridge the remaining differences between Athens and its international creditors on issues like pension or Value Added Tax reform. And Bloomberg has more details too. Greek media were reporting this morning that EU president Jean Claude Juncker had threatened not to see Tsipras if he was not sent an updated proposal from Greece pronto. Perhaps that prompted today\u2019s burst of activity... It\u2019s official! The European Commission has confirmed to Reuters that it has received a new proposal from Greece\u2019s officials this morning. They\u2019re now assessing it.... Greece is also proposing that Europe\u2019s main bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, would provide help it. Today\u2019s three-page plan apparently suggests the ESM buys the \u20ac6.7bn of Greek bonds held by the European Central Bank, which mature in July and August. That idea has been circulating for a while -- the problem is that it\u2019s effectively a new injection of bailout funds for Greece. Crumbs: Greece has reportedly cut its 47-page list of reforms down to just three pages. And Athens is also proposing that the European Central Bank would raise the limits on short-term borrowing, allowing Greece\u2019s banks to buy more Greek debt. That would help cover Greece\u2019s looming debt repayments, and avert the risk of default.... Greece\u2019s negotiators have handed a new proposal to its creditors this morning, according to the AFP newswire. A sign that Greece is following through on yesterday\u2019s pledge to compromise? Stay tuned.... Could the Greek crisis be resolved at year\u2019s Bilderberg conference? No, probably not. But Greece is sandwiched between \u2018Globalisation\u2019 and \u2018Iran\u2019 on his year\u2019s agenda at the world\u2019s most exclusive gathering of the powerful. And that means the heads of the world\u2019s largest banks can hear what Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the eurogroup, and ECB policymaker Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9 think about the crisis. Bilderberg is notoriously secretive, but fortunately some top journalists are there -- including the editors-in-chief of Bloomberg and the Economist, and Martin Wolf of the Financial Times. Tweet early, tweet often, please! Here\u2019s Bilderberg-watcher Charlie Skelton\u2019s preview: European stock markets have nudged a one-month low at the start of trading. The FTSEurofirst 300, which tracks the biggest companies across the region, dipped 0.4% in early deals. The German DAX is down almost 0.5%, pushing the index further into correction territory (down more than 10% from its recent peak). And the euro has dropped by 0.2%, back under $1.13 at $1.1266. Greece continuing to be \u2018front and central\u2019 for markets, says Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services. But there are other factors, as Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: A weaker than expected inflation reading from China has added another layer of uncertainty into matters, coming on top of yesterday\u2019s unexpectedly large fall in imports. Alexis Tsipras has also argued that a deal between Greece and her creditors could be close. However, that would require the IMF, ECB and EC to relax their demands on pension reforms, and other proposals which would push Greece deeper into recession. Tsipras told Corriere Della Sera that: \u201cI think we\u2019re very close to an agreement on the primary surplus for the next few years.... There just needs to be a positive attitude on alternative proposals to cuts to pensions or the imposition of recessionary measures.\u201d And he also pledged to discuss recent progress with Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande at the EU-Latin America summit on Wednesday. Last night, finance minister Yanis Varoufakis claimed that an agreement could be reached in one all-night session, if all sides were serious about getting a deal. We\u2019re ready if you are, guys..... Our Greek readers may have had a disturbed night, after the country was rattled by a magnitude 5.2 earthquake around 4am. No reports of injuries, fortunately. If Greece fails, it will be the beginning of the end of the eurozone. That\u2019s the stark warning from Alexis Tsipras this morning, as Greece\u2019s prime minister battles to reach an agreement with his creditors in time. In an interview with Italy\u2019s Corriere Della Sera, Tsipras rubbished the suggestion that a Grexit would be easily manageable. Instead, he argued, it would trigger the unravelling of the whole European project. Asked if the failure of Greece would also be the failure of the euro, Tsipras replied: I think it\u2019s obvious. It would be the beginning of the end of the eurozone. If the European political leadership cannot handle a problem like that of Greece, which accounts for 2% of its economy, what would the reaction of the markets be to countries facing much larger problems, such as Spain or Italy which has two trillion of public debt? Several European politicians have argued that a Grexit would be relatively containable. Europe has more tools to calm the crisis than in 2012, and a default wouldn\u2019t hit Euro banks hard as few hold Greek debt. But Tsipras says a Greek failure would trigger a domino effect: If Greece fails markets will go now to look for the next. If the negotiation fails, the cost to European taxpayers will be huge. And he also defended Greece\u2019s refusal to compromise on issues such as pensions: After five years of austerity it is inconceivable that we are required to abolish the lowest pensions and subsidies that affect the poorest citizens. Here\u2019s the full interview (in Italian). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek bailout, and other events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It will be another day of negotiations and speculation, as Greece now has just 22 days before its bailout extension expires. Last night, the Wall Street Journal reported that creditors have proposed a nine-month extension to the current programme, propelling the can down the road to March 2016. The WSJ\u2019s Gabriele Steinhauser says: The proposal, first presented last week, is part of European officials\u2019 efforts to prod the government in Athens to agree to painful concessions in exchange for rescue funds. But continued disagreements over the economic overhauls and austerity measures demanded by Greece\u2019s lenders risk undermining the plan, people familiar with the plans say. How would Greece survive until March 2016? Well, lenders would release almost \u20ac11bn of funds currently sitting in Greece\u2019s bank rescue facility, as well as \u20ac7.2bn of bailout loans. Using the bank recap funds isn\u2019t a fresh idea (the FT reported it up last week), but the idea of a nine-month extension is a new development. Steinhauser says the plan was discussed last Wednesday when Alexis Tsipras and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, met in Brussels. \u201cWhat we offered would mean that Greece is fully financed until March 2016,\u201d one of the people said. But to get the deal, Greece would have to cross its red lines on pensions, VAT rates and labour market reforms. Tsipras continues to rule this out, of course, so the deadlock remains... WSJ: Greece, Creditors Discuss Extending Bailout in Bid to Break Deadlock Greek officials will be sitting down with creditors in Brussels today, in another attempt to make progress before Wednesday\u2019s EU-Latin American summit. That will give Alexis Tsipras another chance to bend Angela Merkel\u2019s ear about the crisis. World leaders are looking increasingly jittery about the crisis -- with Barack Obama urging Greece to take \u201ctough choice\u201d yesterday. The pressure to make progress is intense. Also coming up today.... Global banking giant HSBC is announcing a major restructuring plan today. We\u2019ve already learned that it will cut 25,000 jobs worldwide, including thousands in Britain. More details should emerge through the day, which may shed new light on whether it might move its HQ out of the UK. Here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s first take: And on the data side: 9.30am BST: the latest UK trade data is released (for April). 10am: The third estimate of eurozone growth in the first quarter, which will probably confirm GDP rose by 0.4% in January-March.

Moreover, the proposed measures are deemed by the creditor as not sufficient to meet to targets indicated by Athens. While creditors might show some flexibility on the target for 2015, they are likely to be less forthcoming regarding 2016-18.</li> <li><strong>VAT:</strong> Athens may be willing to give up exemptions for the Aegean islands (worth about \u20ac300m), increasing their offer to around \u20ac1.3bn. Ultimately, Athens will likely have to accept the Troika proposal of revenues of around \u20ac1.5-1.8bn, as long as electricity is excluded from the top rate.</li> <li><strong>Pensions: </strong>This remains the major sticking point. Athens offered to scrap early retirement incentives and to increase health contributions of pensions but wants to keep the EKAS benefit for low-income pensioners. The question is whether the Government will commit to cumulative savings target by end 2016 of 1% of GDP.</li> <li><strong>OECD toolkit on product market deregulation:</strong> The IMF insists on passing the reforms not yet implemented by the previous government (over-the-counter drugs, milk, advertising). If Athens delivers, it may get some flexibility on pensions. But SYRIZA once railed against the OECD recommendations, and resistance from vested interests is strong.</li> <li><strong>Privatisation: </strong>Creditors insist on privatizations in the energy sector with the sale of ADMIE (the independent power transmission operator), PPC (or at least a small part of it), and ELPE (Hellenic Petroleum) \u2013 all of which are under the supervision of Energy/Environment Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, the leader of SYRIZA\u2019s leftist platform.</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5576f347e4b06840f081a23a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-09T14:25:18.952Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tsipras urges Syriza to stand by him</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Newsflashes from Athens - Alexis Tsipras has met with top members of his Syriza party, and urged them to support him at this critical time.</strong></p> <p>Tsipras, who looked quite relaxed arriving at the meeting (<em>is that a new jacket?</em>) also told MPs that he is not planning to call fresh elections:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eff9a3869edafae34018bf77932772b338083bb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eff9a3869edafae34018bf77932772b338083bb6/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (C) arrives for a meeting of leftist ruling Syriza party\u2019s political secretariat at the party\u2019s headquarters in Athens, June 9, 2015.

Now, as the prospects for Greece worsen and the euro becomes more depressed, Germany\u2019s exports receive a boost, and Germans become even less sympathetic. Meanwhile, all those panic-driven flows of capital flooding back into Germany have pushed ten-year German bond rates from about 3% in early 2011 to nearly zero today, easing Germany\u2019s own budget problems. No wonder its politicians have been disinclined to spell out the optimal loss-mitigation strategy for Germany and the eurozone.</p> <p>The stark reality is that Greece\u2019s creditors must choose between two unpalatable scenarios. One is that Greece will leave the euro and default on its euro-denominated debt, its creditors will not get repaid anyway, and costly speculative pressures will mount on Portugal, Spain and Italy, while Greece itself will become more unstable politically and economically. The alternative is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/05/greece-determined-to-stay-in-eurozone-economy-minister-george-stathakis\">Greece will stay</a>, and its creditors will have to allow some further write-down on Greek debt. The latter scenario is surely the less painful. </p> <p>Reforms in Greece need to go hand in hand with debt write-downs \u2013 not because of any special virtues of Greece, but because the logic of the euro makes it the only sane way out. Those who led the country into its mess are largely discredited within Greece. It has made huge progress in shifting its primary fiscal balance (i.e. before interest) and its structural fiscal deficit towards surplus. Further reforms now need growth, and this will only happen if economic bygones are treated as bygones. </p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/09/time-end-pretence-greece-never-repay-bailout-loans\">It's time to end the pretence: Greece will never fully repay its bailout loans</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5576de5ee4b06840f081a1dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-09T12:44:03.639Z\">1.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f0db4f29ac22e6277c292a22af5e6140bcc840d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0db4f29ac22e6277c292a22af5e6140bcc840d2/762_32_926_1389/667.jpg\" alt=\"DRESDEN, GERMANY - MAY 28: Italian Minister of Economy and Finance Pier Carlo Padoan.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Italy\u2019s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan</strong>, has rejected <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/09/greek-pm-grexit-warning-bailout-extension-live-updates#block-557688f5e4b073af8b5da7c8\">Alexis Tsipras\u2019s claim today</a> that the eurozone would eventually collapse if Greece left.</p> <p>Speaking on CNBC a moment ago, Padoan said the EU system was much stronger than before.</p> <p>He\u2019s still confident that a Greek deal will come in time, he adds.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-06-09T12:44:16.126Z\">at 1.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5576d83ae4b073af8b5da90a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-09T12:18:09.165Z\">1.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sch\u00e4uble</strong> has also denied reports of a rift with Angela Merkel over Greece. </p> <p>Don\u2019t waste your time with such rumours, he insists.</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-05/merkel-schaeuble-split-on-greece-dismissed-by-german-officials\">German media claimed that the two politicians were divided over Greece</a>, with Merkel determined to avoid Grexit and <strong>Sch\u00e4uble </strong>arguing that stretching the rules for Athens would simply be too dangerous.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_09/06/2015_550823\">Bloomberg reported this morning</a> that the split was widening as the Greece crisis goes down to the wire.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-06-09T12:34:09.731Z\">at 1.34pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5576d5b4e4b073af8b5da8f9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-09T12:12:15.752Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sch\u00e4uble: I still don't agree with Yanis</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Over in Berlin, Germany\u2019s finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is telling reporters that he still disagrees with his Greek counterpart, Yanis Varoufakis, on some issues despite yesterday\u2019s meeting</strong>.</p> <p>Via Reuters:<br></p> <ul> <li>GERMAN FIN MIN SCHAEUBLE SAYS AFTER TALKS WITH GREECE\u2019S VAROUFAKIS ON MONDAY WE STILL HAVE DIFFERING VIEWS</li> </ul> <p>I guess we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the Marxist economist and the centre-right politician don\u2019t quite see the world the same way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SpiegelPeter/statuses/608243257638846464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In other news, the earth still appears to be revolving around the sun... <a href=\"https://t.co/3UqJAYx4x5\">https://t.co/3UqJAYx4x5</a></p>&mdash;

The Brits win that one, surely: possible exit from the EU looks more comfortable than having the Chinese Communist party breathing down your neck. How about high Transparency International score? Another easy victory, you\u2019d think. And tax system? Well, given HSBC\u2019s grumbles about the bank levy, Britain wouldn\u2019t play its joker in that round. Welcome to HSBC\u2019s Structured Review of Location of Holding Company to maximise long-term shareholder value. It comprises eleven criteria HSBC will use to decide whether to quit the UK. The process seems to be a little like choosing a new car. Model A goes from 0-60mph faster and the seats are terrific; but model B has more room in the boot and lots of those useful cup holders. Is this really, though, a suitable way to decide where to domicile a big bank? The problem with Hong Kong remains what it was in 1992, when HSBC moved to the UK with the purchase of Midland Bank: the lack of democracy under Chinese rule. Hong Kong\u2019s post-handover experience may have softened HSBC\u2019s worries, but can anyone be confident what the position will be 10, 20 or 30 years from now? By moving to Hong Kong, HSBC might save $1bn a year on the bank levy. There are established models to calculate that capital value: call it $12bn in today\u2019s money, say analysts. But how on earth do you put a similar financial value/deduction on shifting a large international bank to a territory under the control of a non-democratic regime? It\u2019s impossible. That\u2019s the problem with HSBC\u2019s approach. The bank may call its review \u201cstructured\u201d, but it comes down to management\u2019s appetite for political risk. That issue towers above all others. In practice, one suspects, the process is a dance designed to persuade George Osborne to go soft on the bank levy, perhaps by charging it solely on UK assets once the banks have ringfenced their UK operations by 2019. Perhaps the chancellor will give ground on that score in time: it would not be irrational to recognise that ringfencing, when complete, reduces the risks of future banking crises to UK taxpayers. But Osborne would be silly to make public commitments tonight. The Mansion House speech is not an occasion to play Domicile Top Trumps. Colossal effort needed from Gulliver to keep pace with events As for HSBC\u2019s latest strategy itself, shareholders were underwhelmed. In short, the bank will have to make a colossal effort, in the form of shedding 25,000 jobs plus operations in Brazil and Turkey, to achieve merely acceptable performance ratios. The prize paraded by chief executive Stuart Gulliver was a return on equity of greater than 10% by 2017. That outcome would be better than the 7.3% achieved by HSBC last year, but the best medium-term returns in the sector are destined to come from domestic players, like Wells Fargo in the US and Lloyds Banking Group in the UK. The question is whether HSBC, even after its \u201cpivot\u201d towards Asia, will still be too big and too sprawling to be managed efficiently. Gulliver offered a robust defence of the model, arguing that $22bn of HSBC\u2019s revenues can be attributed to its global network. It\u2019s only \u201cthree or four or five\u201d big countries that have been spoiling the mix. If laggards can be fixed or sold, the broth will taste better. As a plan, it\u2019s credible. But it was also credible when version A was unveiled in 2011. In the meantime, Brazil and Turkey have declined in value and the competition in Asia is getting stronger. HSBC is still struggling to keep up with events. Hardly a peep from shareholders on Sorrell\u2019s \u00a343m remuneration By WPP\u2019s standards, it was a decent result: \u201conly\u201d 22% of voting shareholders refused to back a pay report that contained chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s \u00a343m pay package. It was the weakest rebellion for years. The steam went out of this debate in 2013 when WPP agreed to dismantle the Leadership Equity Acquisition Plan (Leap), its supercharged co-investment scheme. The twist, however, was that Leap was allowed to expire naturally. The last of the five-year cycles runs until 2016, allowing Sorrell and co a few handsome last hurrahs. In its way, the shuffle by the pay committee was brilliant: shareholders could congratulate themselves on imposing \u201crestraint\u201d, but Sorrell\u2019s pay was allowed to rise for a while. The great man can even collect \u00a3274,000 for \u201cspousal travel costs\u201d these days and hardly anybody cries foul.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The highest paid director at Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group received a 38% pay rise, to \u00a31.55m, last year as the group cut 2,000 jobs. The director, thought to be Ian Grabiner, Green\u2019s right-hand man, was paid \u00a31.55m in the year to 30 August 2014 according to accounts filed at Companies House. Total payments to directors rose to \u00a34.22m, up from \u00a34.05m a year before, despite board members dropping from five to three. The payouts came as sales at the group, which owns the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge, Evans and Wallis outlets, remained steady at \u00a32.71m but operating profits (before exceptional items) slid to \u00a3172.3m against \u00a3204m. The fall reflects a tough time for fashion retailers in which \u201cmarket conditions remain challenging and very competitive with new entrants across all channels,\u201d according to the accounts for Taveta Investments, a holding company controlled by Tina Green, Sir Philip\u2019s wife. The fall in profits was also partly the result of a comparison against a 53-week financial year in 2013 as well as difficulties at the BHS chain, which was offloaded for \u00a31 to a group of little-known investors in March. The group\u2019s sales rose by 8% overseas, mainly in the US and Ireland, to \u00a3397m and slipped by 2% within the UK to \u00a32.3bn \u2013 with declines in sales at Arcadia\u2019s other chains as well as BHS. As it tried to cut costs in the tough market, the group reduced its number of staff by 2,000, including nearly 400 job cuts at BHS. Arcadia\u2019s net debt fell by \u00a3100m to \u00a3193m and investment in the business rose to \u00a3107m from \u00a393m in the previous financial year. Meanwhile companies controlled by the Green family received \u00a320m in payments to redeem loan notes relating to BHS group and interest of \u00a311.5m on further outstanding loans. The Green family\u2019s Carmen property company also received \u00a310.93m in rent on BHS properties. Jersey-based Carmen has since sold the 12 BHS properties to the chain\u2019s new owners. Last week it emerged that BHS\u2019s pension scheme deficit rose to \u00a3139m in the year to 30 August 2014. The funds\u2019 trustees are in negotiations with BHS\u2019s new owners, Retail Acquisitions, over how to handle the deficit, the value of which is likely to increase significantly under a triennial valuation currently underway.",

In a broad based sell-off the FTSE 100 fell 36.24 points to 6753.80, its lowest level since 13 March. European markets were also lower, with Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.7% and France\u2019s Cac falling 0.19%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up around 25 points by the time London closed, as better than expected job openings figures added to Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers to ease concerns about weakness in the US economy.

Among the UK fallers, Admiral dropped 19p to \u00a314.36 after its Confused.com price comparison business was criticised by a Channel 4 Dispatches programme over the limited number of savings accounts it showed in search results.

Meanwhile Pets At Home lost 7.2p to 273.8p as private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts sold 21.6% of the company at 267p a share to raise \u00a3288m.

Analyst Clive Black said: Poundland is due to release its 2015 preliminary results (March year-end) on Thursday 18 June. Noting recent UK consumer market data and the strength of sterling versus the euro, we have reappraised our financial forecasts for the group on a cautionary basis; note \u2013 we have already lowered our 2016 estimates for Poundland on 30th March 2015, reflecting slower fourth quarter trading and precautionary comments on the potential for sterling strength to negatively impact EBITDA by \u00a34m. Since that time we have observed a number of factors which lead us to once again review our forecasts with a downward bent. These factors are: \u2022 Sterling has remained firm against the euro through much of first quarter... \u2022 Poundland faces tough comparatives in the first quarter, which we have factored into our previous forecast reductions. Since then secondary data has been subdued...Accordingly, we are concerned that Poundland\u2019s first quarter trading momentum may have slipped back further, perhaps mid- single-digit sales growth rather than the double-digit momentum that investors have been used to since flotation and the 7.5% growth assumed in our previous forecasts. As a consequence of our expectations we deem it appropriate to take down our 2016 forecasts again, cutting our current pretax profit to \u00a347.5m from \u00a350.5m (our prior estimate for 2016 was \u00a351.8m). This reduction is precautionary and may unwind if sterling weakens against the euro, so mitigating the currency impact on the Irish operation, and UK trading regains momentum faster than we are currently expecting.

      "bodyText": "Plumes of dark smoke spiral from the chimney stacks sticking out of the grey dirt around Port Talbot docks. It is not a pretty sight, but this industrial mess of blast furnaces, warehouses and cooling towers has been at the centre of modern steelmaking in these parts since 1902. This south Wales town, like the British steel industry, has seen better days. But things are about to take a new turn for the worse. On Monday 22 June, around 17,000 workers at Tata Steel plants across the country will bring Britain\u2019s steel industry to a halt with the first national strike for 35 years. The walkout is a response to Tata\u2019s plan to close the British Steel pension scheme. Tata, an Indian conglomerate, has owned British Steel\u2019s remaining operations since 2007 when it bought Corus, the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker, for \u00a36.7bn in a debt-fuelled deal. It now wants to end the final salary scheme for existing members and scrap provisions that allow members to retire early at 60, which the steelmaker says is a huge financial burden. The move effectively raises the retirement age to 65. John Tetsill is the third generation of his family to work at the Port Talbot steelworks and is also a member of the Community union\u2019s national executive committee. He said attacking workers\u2019 pensions was a step too far and that the workforce felt betrayed. \u201cSince 2008, the market conditions have been hard and everything we\u2019ve been asked to do has been done,\u201d Tetsill said. Union leaders fear the pension changes could compromise safety and lead to an increase in serious accidents, or even fatalities. One Port Talbot steelworker, in his early 40s, warned: \u201cWorking 12-hour shifts at my age is hard, but at 65 it\u2019s going to be dangerous.\u201d The steel company must also be careful that its UK issues do not poison the rest of its European business. Union sources said that LNV, a large Dutch union, has already reassured British colleagues that its membership will refuse any work sent to plants in the Netherlands from Britain during the strike. Tata Steel employs 17,000 around the UK, including 4,000 at Port Talbot, its largest site. The steelmaker\u2019s Indian parent also owns Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley Tea. It formed Tata Steel Europe when it snapped up Corus. Since then, the steelmaker has been hit by a toxic combination of high debts, falling demand and cut-throat Chinese competition. Last year, Tata Steel Europe racked up a loss of \u00a3402m, which followed a record loss of \u00a31.2bn in the year to March 2013. The ailing group has responded by axing thousands of British jobs, selling assets and writing down the value of its European business by \u00a31.7bn. It also closed the gold-plated pension scheme \u2013 one of the biggest in Britain with almost \u00a314bn in assets \u2013 to new entrants last year. New employees instead join a defined contribution pension scheme into which Tata pays 10% of salary \u2013 about the average contribution to these sorts of pension plans, but less than the more generous final salary scheme. Despite this, Tata said more drastic measures were needed to address its spiralling pension liabilities. It estimates that the most recent triennial valuation, to March 2014, will show the pension deficit has ballooned to a whopping \u00a32bn, up from \u00a3550m in 2011. It is thought this pensions black hole has continued to widen since that last valuation as a result of lower gilt yields. Tata said: \u201cEveryone agrees that change is needed to resolve the challenges facing our pension scheme, which has a projected shortfall of more than \u00a32bn.\u201d On Wednesday, Karl-Ulrich K\u00f6hler, chief executive of Tata Steel Europe, will try to calm rising tensions when he meets with MPs from the all-party parliamentary group on steel. Tom Blenkinsop, chairman of the parliamentary group and MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, will ask K\u00f6hler why the steel giant has not funded the deficit. \u201cThey [the workers] could say, \u2018I\u2019ve paid 25 to 30 years of deferred income and now you are nicking it from me\u2019,\u201d Blenkinsop said. \u201cFor the workforce, they are willing to negotiate on everything but the pension.\u201d This has been borne out by the staggeringly high turnout and vote for industrial action by members of Community, the largest trade union at Tata Steel. In total, 88% voted in favour of strike action; that figure rose to 96% in Port Talbot. The national turnout was 76% and in Port Talbot it was 84%. Tata pointed out that the total turnout, across all four big unions (GMB, Unite, Ucatt and Community), was around 59%. Blenkinsop believes Tata has misjudged the strength of opposition among its workforce and said the ballot results \u201cshould be ringing in Tata\u2019s ears\u201d. He urged the company to return to negotiations, listen to workers\u2019 concerns and thrash out a concession agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be painful for the workforce, but it won\u2019t be more painful than losing the final salary pension scheme,\u201d he said. Sources suggested K\u00f6hler and his team are working on four \u201cmitigation measures\u201d that will be revealed within days. One of these is almost certain to address union leaders\u2019 concerns about scrapping the rules on early retirement at 60. Ultimately, Tata cannot afford to continue to fund a pension that has many thousands more members drawing out cash than are putting in. The scheme has 135,000 members: around 86,000 are retired and already drawing their pension; a further 33,000 are deferred members; and there are just 16,000 current employees who continue to pay contributions. John Ralfe, a pensions consultant, reckons Tata\u2019s move to close the scheme will not make too much difference to the deficit in the scheme. He said: \u201cClosing the scheme to existing employees won\u2019t reduce the overall deficit by much, as most of the members have left the company and are already drawing a pension or waiting to draw a pension. Tata will still have most of the \u00a32bn deficit to deal with.\u201d Ralfe said the company and trustees of the pension scheme will be agreeing deficit contributions as part of the 2014 actuarial valuation. This will then have to be approved by the pensions regulator. But all this may have come too late for older Tata Steel workers, many of whom face huge uncertainty about their retirement incomes. \u201cThey are just seeing the finishing line and now that\u2019s been taken away,\u201d Tetsill said. \u201cA lot of people have been left floundering at the moment. Unfortunately, there will be bad feelings about Tata because they are taking our pension away.\u201d History of British Steel 1967 \u2013 British Steel Corporation is formed when the Labour government nationalises the 14 biggest producers in the UK 1970s \u2013 falling world demand and a global recession cripples British Steel.

Tata said: \u201cEveryone agrees that change is needed to resolve the challenges facing our pension scheme, which has a projected shortfall of more than \u00a32bn.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, Karl-Ulrich K\u00f6hler, chief executive of Tata Steel Europe, will try to calm rising tensions when he meets with MPs from the all-party parliamentary group on steel.</p> <p>Tom Blenkinsop, chairman of the parliamentary group and MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, will ask K\u00f6hler why the steel giant has not funded the deficit. \u201cThey [the workers] could say, \u2018I\u2019ve paid 25 to 30 years of deferred income and now you are nicking it from me\u2019,\u201d Blenkinsop said. \u201cFor the workforce, they are willing to negotiate on everything but the pension.\u201d</p> <p>This has been borne out by the staggeringly high turnout and vote for industrial action by members of Community, the largest trade union at Tata Steel. In total, 88% voted in favour of strike action; that figure rose to 96% in Port Talbot. The national turnout was 76% and in Port Talbot it was 84%.</p> <p>Tata pointed out that the total turnout, across all four big unions (GMB, Unite, Ucatt and Community), was around 59%.</p> <p>Blenkinsop believes Tata has misjudged the strength of opposition among its workforce and said the ballot results \u201cshould be ringing in Tata\u2019s ears\u201d. He urged the company to return to negotiations, listen to workers\u2019 concerns and thrash out a concession agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be painful for the workforce, but it won\u2019t be more painful than losing the final salary pension scheme,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Sources suggested K\u00f6hler and his team are working on four \u201cmitigation measures\u201d that will be revealed within days. One of these is almost certain to address union leaders\u2019 concerns about scrapping the rules on early retirement at 60.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/16/why-britain-doesnt-make-things-manufacturing\">Why doesn't Britain make things any more?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, Tata cannot afford to continue to fund a pension that has many thousands more members drawing out cash than are putting in. The scheme has 135,000 members: around 86,000 are retired and already drawing their pension; a further 33,000 are deferred members; and there are just 16,000 current employees who continue to pay contributions.</p> <p>John Ralfe, a pensions consultant, reckons Tata\u2019s move to close the scheme will not make too much difference to the deficit in the scheme. He said: \u201cClosing the scheme to existing employees won\u2019t reduce the overall deficit by much, as most of the members have left the company and are already drawing a pension or waiting to draw a pension. Tata will still have most of the \u00a32bn deficit to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>Ralfe said the company and trustees of the pension scheme will be agreeing deficit contributions as part of the 2014 actuarial valuation. This will then have to be approved by the pensions regulator.</p> <p>But all this may have come too late for older Tata Steel workers, many of whom face huge uncertainty about their retirement incomes.</p> <p>\u201cThey are just seeing the finishing line and now that\u2019s been taken away,\u201d Tetsill said.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people have been left floundering at the moment. Unfortunately, there will be bad feelings about Tata because they are taking our pension away.\u201d</p> <h2>History of British Steel</h2> <ul> <li>1967 \u2013 British Steel Corporation is formed when the Labour government nationalises the 14 biggest producers in the UK<br></li> <li>1970s \u2013 falling world demand and a global recession cripples British Steel.

    "webTitle": "HSBC to rebrand UK high street bank as global shakeup sheds 25,000 jobs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "HSBC is to axe 25,000 jobs around the world \u2013 including up to 8,000 in the UK \u2013 in a shakeup that will also spell the end of the bank\u2019s trademark red and white hexagonal logo on UK high streets. Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of Britain\u2019s biggest bank, said customers and staff would be consulted on a new name for the 1,000-strong branch network in the UK, and that it was too soon to say whether HSBC would retain ownership of the operation. Since taking the helm in 2011, Gulliver has cut the workforce from 296,000 to 257,000 and has signalled another 25,000 reductions to turn the bank\u2019s focus towards Asian markets and adopt digital technology. Another 25,000 jobs will go from the workforce through the sell-off of Turkey and Brazil. About 8,000 UK jobs \u2013 one in six of the bank\u2019s British workforce \u2013 are to go, a move that infuriated unions. \u201cAfter all the scandals of recent years, frontline staff have suffered time and time again as they are forced to pay for the mistakes of others with their jobs, their terms and conditions and their reputation,\u201d Dominic Hook, Unite\u2019s national officer for finance, said. Gulliver also set out the criteria the bank will use to decide whether to keep its headquarters in the UK, where it has been based since 1992 when it moved from Hong Kong to enable the takeover of Midland bank. A decision will be made by the end of the year. Analysts at Shore Capital said: \u201cHong Kong and Canada were mooted by management as possible locations.\u201d Analysts at Investec said: \u201cWe think the financial logic for HSBC to escape the clutches of the UK (and Europe) is overwhelming. What possible reason is there to stay?\u201d The job cuts are not part of that review, which will kickstart a debate about the government\u2019s tax policy and attitude to financial services companies \u2013 two of the 11 factors HSBC will use to determine whether to stay based in London. The UK bank levy, which costs HSBC \u00a3700m a year, will be part of its decision and has prompted speculation that the chancellor, George Osborne, could launch a review of the measure in his Mansion House speech on Wednesday. Regulatory changes already under way mean that HSBC is also setting up new operations in Birmingham for the local head office of its \u201cringfenced bank\u201d. All banks must comply with rules coming into force into 2019 to have a ringfence separating their high street operations and their riskier investment banking business. This Birmingham-based bank will employ 26,000 staff and will not use the HSBC name, which appeared on the UK high street about 15 years ago when Midland\u2019s griffin logo was replaced. The Midland name could now be resurrected. Gulliver said the ringfencing rules required a rebranding so customers to be able to differentiate between the ringfenced and non-ringfenced bank \u2013 though this fuelled speculation he would sell the UK arm. The hexagonal logo is a familiar sight across the world, and adorns every airbridge at Heathrow airport. His strategy review, entitled Actions to capture value from our global presence in a changed world, involved what he described as a significant reshaping of the business, to achieve global cost-savings of $5bn (\u00a33.3bn). Operations in Turkey and Brazil will be sold\u2013 although a small presence will be maintained in Brazil. The Mexican and US businesses, which Gulliver had previously described as underperforming, will be retained. He blamed the bank\u2019s weak performance on those four troublesome countries \u2013 along with the UK, which had been plagued by fines and compensation costs. The bank said it had incurred $11.2bn of regulatory charges in the last four years, about $5.7bn of which are related to the mis-selling of payment protection insurance. The number of staff working in compliance has more than doubled, from 3,200 to 7,200. While he is overhauling the bank, he is not changing its structure. To make the case against breaking up the bank, he said the current structure generated $22bn of revenue. \u201cHSBC has an unrivalled global position: access to high-growth markets; a diversified universal banking model with strong funding and a low-risk profile; and strong internal capital generation with industry-leading dividends,\u201d Gulliver said. But he added: \u201cWe recognise the world has changed and we need to change with it.\u201d The investment banking arm will also shrink to use less of its global balance sheet, from almost 40% to nearer 33%, in a move intended to not only bolster performance but \u201creduce the risk of further fines and conduct redress penalties\u201d. As soon as he took the helm in 2011 after a lengthy career with HSBC, Gulliver pulled back from the bank\u2019s strategy to be the \u201cworld\u2019s local bank\u201d and retrenched from a presence in 87 countries or territories to 73. He also introduced the motto of \u201ccourageous integrity\u201d \u2013 the purpose of which became clearer after the bank was slapped with a \u00a31.2bn fine the following year by US authorities over laundering money for Mexican drug barons. Since then it has been embroiled in the foreign exchange-rigging debacle and more recently a tax-avoidance scandal after the leak of account details of customers of its Swiss banking arm to the Guardian and other publications. In a five hour presentation, he set out how the bank is shifting its focus to the faster growing economies of Asia. Gulliver set out a 10-point plan for the coming years as he reshapes the business. While investment is being pulled back from developed economies, he is accelerating growth plans in the Pearl River Delta near Hong Kong and Macau, and other parts of Asia. \u201cWe believe the world\u2019s economy will move to the east,\u201d said Gulliver, speaking from London.",

Another 25,000 jobs will go from the workforce through the sell-off of Turkey and Brazil.</p> <p>About 8,000 UK jobs \u2013 one in six of the bank\u2019s British workforce \u2013 are to go, a move that infuriated unions. \u201cAfter all the scandals of recent years, frontline staff have suffered time and time again as they are forced to pay for the mistakes of others with their jobs, their terms and conditions and their reputation,\u201d Dominic Hook, Unite\u2019s national officer for finance, said. </p> <p>Gulliver also set out the criteria the bank will use to decide whether to keep its headquarters in the UK, where it has been based since 1992 when it moved from Hong Kong to enable the takeover of Midland bank. A decision <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/05/hsbc-to-decide-this-year-on-moving-its-hq-from-uk\">will be made by the end of the year</a>. Analysts at Shore Capital said: \u201cHong Kong and Canada were mooted by management as possible locations.\u201d</p> <p>Analysts at Investec said: \u201cWe think the financial logic for HSBC to escape the clutches of the UK (and Europe) is overwhelming. What possible reason is there to stay?\u201d</p> <p>The job cuts are not part of that review, which will kickstart a debate about the government\u2019s tax policy and attitude to financial services companies \u2013 two of the 11 factors HSBC will use to determine whether to stay based in London. The UK bank levy, which costs HSBC \u00a3700m a year, will be part of its decision and has prompted speculation that the chancellor, George Osborne, could launch a review of the measure in his Mansion House speech on Wednesday.</p> <p>Regulatory changes already under way mean that HSBC is also setting up new operations in Birmingham for the local head office of its \u201cringfenced bank\u201d. All banks must comply with rules coming into force into 2019 to have a ringfence separating their high street operations and their riskier investment banking business.</p> <p>This Birmingham-based bank will employ 26,000 staff and will not use the HSBC name, which appeared on the UK high street about 15 years ago when Midland\u2019s griffin logo was replaced. The Midland name could now be resurrected. Gulliver said the ringfencing rules required a rebranding so customers to be able to differentiate between the ringfenced and non-ringfenced bank \u2013 though this fuelled speculation he would sell the UK arm.</p> <p>The hexagonal logo is a familiar sight across the world, and adorns every airbridge at Heathrow airport.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8b9918a3-8a3b-4ff2-982a-567e90ae1fbc\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433867680755/50320093-e879-4062-b3ce-5affc9f3bb1d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Stuart Gulliver\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stuart Gulliver, HSBC chief executive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His strategy review, entitled <a href=\"http://www.hsbc.com/investor-relations/investing-in-hsbc/investor-update-2015?WT.ac=HGHQ_Ir_h1.2_IMS_On\">Actions to capture value from our global presence in a changed world</a>, involved what he described as a significant reshaping of the business, to achieve global cost-savings of $5bn (\u00a33.3bn). Operations in Turkey and Brazil will be sold\u2013 although a small presence will be maintained in Brazil. The Mexican and US businesses, which Gulliver had previously described as underperforming, will be retained.</p> <p>He blamed the bank\u2019s weak performance on those four troublesome countries \u2013 along with the UK, which had been plagued by fines and compensation costs. The bank said it had incurred $11.2bn of regulatory charges in the last four years, about $5.7bn of which are related to the mis-selling of payment protection insurance.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is surely clear to all sides by now \u2013 if rarely admitted \u2013 that Greece will never fully repay its bailout loans. The current approach requires Greece to run a large and protracted budget surplus to satisfy its creditors\u2019 demands. This will force it to drain itself of demand for a generation or more to transfer to other countries huge amounts of what the Greek people produce. History and economic principles teach us that trying to enforce such reparations-style logic on a heavily damaged economy will only serve to destroy it and harm the intended recipients too. It is time to end the pretence, and for Greek sovereign debt write-downs to become the central carrot for motivating growth-enhancing reforms in Greece. For sure, Greece was at fault in joining the euro with the ratio of its sovereign debt to its GDP at over 100%, but its punishment is way beyond anything justified by this. Indeed, perhaps half the debt burden of Greece today is the result of the design faults of the euro. After joining the single currency, Greece was flooded with super-cheap credit. Germany\u2019s balance of payments surpluses ballooned from about \u20ac50bn when the euro was launched, to about \u20ac200bn in 2007, and these were recycled by enthusiastic banks as huge capital flows to the periphery of Europe. Germany built up a huge stock of claims against countries such as Greece, on which it was bound to lose one day. The only unknowns were the timing and how messy things would get. When all those capital flows went into reverse, Greece, because of the euro, could no longer print its own money, nor devalue its currency to boost its exports, nor cut its interest rates, nor launch its own policy of quantitative easing, nor generate higher inflation to reduce the real value of its debt. Many other countries shifted the burdens of their failed banks on to their governments\u2019 balance sheets. In Greece, this would have increased the dangers of a sovereign default, and so Germany, the UK, the eurozone, and others, got their own banks indirectly bailed out through a loan-based \u201cbailout\u201d of Greece, dumping the problems onto the ECB and the IMF, as a gigantic IOU for the people of Greece. A temporary increase in government deficits in a depression is entirely natural. For Greece, locked within the euro, such an increase heightened the risk of default, which pushed Greek borrowing costs higher, which made the ratio of its government debt to GDP rise even further. Preventing such destructive feedback-loops needed a mechanism for fiscal transfers within the eurozone towards member states facing big negative shocks or taking on the financial burdens of their banks. Instead, Greece has been made to devalue internally. However, starving the country of domestic demand, and introducing massive economic uncertainty, has only served to depress both public and private sector investment there. It has devastated huge swaths of productive human capital (think of what 25% unemployment and over 50% youth unemployment do to the growth and tax-raising prospects of an economy). It has generated even higher ratios of sovereign debt to GDP, and it has further stoked deflation within Greece and the eurozone as a whole. At first, the German people welcomed the artificial upside of the euro, and passed the systemic risk consequences on to countries such as Greece. Now, as the prospects for Greece worsen and the euro becomes more depressed, Germany\u2019s exports receive a boost, and Germans become even less sympathetic. Meanwhile, all those panic-driven flows of capital flooding back into Germany have pushed 10-year German bond rates from about 3% in early 2011 to nearly zero today, easing Germany\u2019s own budget problems. No wonder its politicians have been disinclined to spell out the optimal loss-mitigation strategy for Germany and the eurozone. The stark reality is that Greece\u2019s creditors must choose between two unpalatable scenarios. One is that Greece will leave the euro and default on its euro-denominated debt, its creditors will not get repaid anyway, and costly speculative pressures will mount on Portugal, Spain and Italy, while Greece itself will become more unstable politically and economically. The alternative is that Greece will stay, and its creditors will have to allow some further write-down on Greek debt. The latter scenario is surely the less painful. Reforms in Greece need to go hand in hand with debt write-downs \u2013 not because of any special virtues of Greece, but because the logic of the euro makes it the only sane way out. Those who led the country into its mess are largely discredited within Greece. It has made huge progress in shifting its primary fiscal balance (i.e. before interest) and its structural fiscal deficit towards surplus. Further reforms now need growth, and this will only happen if economic bygones are treated as bygones. \u2022Andrew Farlow is research fellow in economics at Oriel College, Oxford, and author of, among others, Crash and Beyond: Causes and Consequences of the Global Financial Crisis (OUP, 2013)",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The energy and climate change secretary has given planning permission to one of the most ambitious and potentially expensive \u201cgreen\u201d energy schemes ever seen in Britain. Amber Rudd agreed the \u00a31bn project to provide power for 150,000 homes from a tidal lagoon at Swansea Bay, although she has become embroiled in a separate but connected row over a super-quarry to provide stone for the Welsh project. Mark Shorrock, chief executive of Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay, said his marine power project was a \u201cgame-changer\u201d that should trigger a much wider industry in tidal energy around the UK. \u201cThe tidal lagoons that follow \u2013 at Cardiff, at Newport, elsewhere in the UK and overseas \u2013 must each make their own compelling social, environmental and economic case to proceed. But they have a pilot project to guide them and a blossoming technical and industrial network to support them.\u201d Planning permission is essential to the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon scheme but its future ultimately depends on a separate decision by the department on subsidies. The Conservative party has made clear that it wants to end subsidies for onshore wind schemes but is understood to see opportunities for jobs and exports from the potentially more costly Swansea Bay scheme. But energy and climate change and Wales office minister Lord Bourne, who announced the green light for the scheme, said: \u201cWe need more clean and home-grown sources of energy, which will help to reduce our reliance on foreign fossil fuels. Low-carbon energy projects like the tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay could bring investment, support local jobs and help contribute to the Welsh economy and Swansea area.\u201d Meanwhile, Rudd has been dragged into an escalating row over plans to mine stone in Cornwall for the Swansea Bay breakwater and ship it through a marine conservation zone. Derek Thomas, the newly elected Conservative MP for St Ives, has joined other residents in opposing the reopening of Dean quarry near St Keverne. He has written to Rudd asking her to intervene. \u201cI have no doubt this is not the right place to source the stone. Any jobs created would not replace others that could be lost in fishing, tourism and diving,\u201d he added. \u201cThe stone could be obtained more cheaply in Norway and I have written to Amber Rudd to explain this.\u201d The National Trust also said it had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the plan, which would involve the construction of a loading jetty and shipping operations off the Lizard peninsula. In a letter to the Guardian published last Thursday, Sir Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate art galleries, wrote in a personal capacity to express surprise that Mark Shorrock, the chief executive of Tidal Lagoon Power, had insisted in an interview that no decisions had been taken to source materials from Cornwall. This seemed at odds, Serota said, with Shorrock telling a meeting in Cornwall that he was applying for planning permission to reopen Dean quarry and extract 1.5m tonnes of rock a year. Tidal Power Lagoon said the project, which is being proposed by Shire Oak, a separate Shorrock company, could not go ahead until it had planning permission for the jetty and a contract to supply the stone to Swansea Bay, neither of which was yet certain. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair (to criticise). The whole point of going down there (for public meetings in Cornwall) was for early engagement to show what the plans for the site could be,\u201d said a spokesman for Shorrock.",

Peter Humphrey has been released on health grounds after serving nearly two years of a two-and-a-half-year sentence, according to the Financial Times. Humphrey and his wife and business partner, Yu Yingzeng, were detained in July 2013 by Chinese police, who were also investigating bribery allegations against GSK. The British pharmaceutical company had employed the couple to investigate bribery claims at the company and a sex tape featuring the then head of GSK China. Soon after the couple began their investigations, Chinese authorities accused GSK of funnelling up to 3bn yuan (\u00a3312m) to bribe doctors to buy their medicines. Humphrey later criticised the pharmaceutical firm for not revealing the full extent of the allegations against them. Humphrey is now said to be in a Shanghai hospital undergoing cancer tests and will be deported from the country once he is discharged, according to anonymous sources cited by the FT. His wife, a Chinese-born, American citizen remains in jail. She is expected to be released on 11 July, but will be allowed to remain in China. The couple, who were paraded on state television in handcuffs and orange prison vests, were charged with illegally purchasing information about Chinese citizens, including ID and phone numbers. During their one-day trial, which excluded foreign media, Chinese prosecutors did not make any link between the GSK investigation and the case against the couple. International observers criticised the secrecy surrounding the trial and airing of \u201cconfessions\u201d on national TV, a common practice for disgraced officials in China. Although Humphrey apologised to the Chinese government in a TV broadcast, he told the court he did not think the couple had done anything illegal. The couple\u2019s son, Harvey Humphrey, also expressed concern that family and consular officials were denied access to the trial Peter Humphrey, a former Reuters journalist and longtime China resident, set up the consultancy ChinaWhys with his wife in 2003 to conduct fraud investigations and due diligence for international companies. They were hired by GSK to investigate a security breach, after a tape of the firm\u2019s then China boss having sex with his girlfriend was sent to senior GSK executives, including chief executive Andrew Witty. Senior GSK executives also received emails alleging bribery. But the couple became a target for investigators once an inquiry into illegal payments at GSK was launched. Humphrey later said he felt \u201ccheated\u201d by GSK and in a letter from jail he accused the London-listed pharmaceutical company of failing to reveal the full extent of corruption allegations against them. GSK was fined 3bn yuan in September 2014 after a guilty verdict from a Chinese court. GSK declined to comment. Calls to ChinaWhys went unanswered.",

At \u00a38.6bn after \u00a310.7bn the month before, it was the lowest deficit since March 2014.</p> <p>Economists said the narrowing boded well for overall growth after net trade was a drag on the economy in a slow opening quarter to 2015.

That will reassure businesses who have been looking to emerging markets and the US for trade as the eurozone continues to suffer from shaky business and consumer confidence.</p> <p>With signs that eurozone growth is now picking up, prospects for UK trade and the broader economy were looking brighter, said Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight.</p> <p>\u201cThe April trade data show considerable improvement, thereby raising hopes that net trade may well help UK GDP growth to improve in the second quarter,\u201d said Archer.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhile UK GDP growth will clearly remain largely reliant on domestic demand, the hope has to be that exports will increasingly benefit over the coming months from improved eurozone growth. However, the strength of the pound against the euro threatens to continue to constrain the upside for UK manufacturing exports to the eurozone.\u201d</p> <p>The pound has strengthened against the single currency since the start of this year, making UK goods more expensive to eurozone buyers.</p> <p>The ONS said the deficit for trade in goods and services together also narrowed to its lowest since March 2014, to stand at an estimated \u00a31.2bn this April from \u00a33.1bn the previous month.

      "bodyText": "A jump in exports helped Britain\u2019s trade gap narrow to its smallest for a year in April, raising hopes that overall economic growth has rebounded from its slump at the start of 2015. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said goods exports rose and imports fell in April, helping the trade deficit to shrink by more than City economists had forecast and by the biggest amount since June 2013. At \u00a38.6bn after \u00a310.7bn the month before, it was the lowest deficit since March 2014. Economists said the narrowing boded well for overall growth after net trade was a drag on the economy in a slow opening quarter to 2015. The consensus forecast in a Reuters poll had been for the April deficit to narrow only moderately to \u00a39.9bn. \u201cAlthough the near-term outlook for the external sector does not look fantastic, at least net trade this quarter looks unlikely to repeat the first quarter\u2019s big negative contribution to overall GDP growth,\u201d said Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. Smallest gap for a year The April figures showed that much of the growth in exports came from sales to countries beyond the UK\u2019s key market, the European Union. That will reassure businesses who have been looking to emerging markets and the US for trade as the eurozone continues to suffer from shaky business and consumer confidence. With signs that eurozone growth is now picking up, prospects for UK trade and the broader economy were looking brighter, said Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight. \u201cThe April trade data show considerable improvement, thereby raising hopes that net trade may well help UK GDP growth to improve in the second quarter,\u201d said Archer. \u201cWhile UK GDP growth will clearly remain largely reliant on domestic demand, the hope has to be that exports will increasingly benefit over the coming months from improved eurozone growth. However, the strength of the pound against the euro threatens to continue to constrain the upside for UK manufacturing exports to the eurozone.\u201d The pound has strengthened against the single currency since the start of this year, making UK goods more expensive to eurozone buyers. The ONS said the deficit for trade in goods and services together also narrowed to its lowest since March 2014, to stand at an estimated \u00a31.2bn this April from \u00a33.1bn the previous month. The UK runs a surplus in the trade of services, which covers activities like banking and legal services. Within trade in goods, exports rose \u00a30.7bn, of which \u00a30.6bn was attributed to countries outside the EU. Imports of goods fell by \u00a31.5bn. Statisticians caution that monthly trade figures can be volatile and they recommend looking at three-monthly numbers to get a more accurate picture. On that basis the UK\u2019s trade deficit widened. In the three months to April, the goods and services trade gap was an estimated \u00a37.2bn, widening by \u00a31.6bn from the three months to January 2015. The goods deficit also widened, by \u00a31bn to \u00a330bn, after a \u00a31.9bn fall in exports, largely down to lower oil exports. The breakdown of where UK exports go continued to show strong reliance on the EU.

      "bodyText": "Alexis Tsipras has warned that the failure to agree a rescue deal for Greece would spell the end of the eurozone as he submitted a revised package of reforms to negotiators in Brussels. The Greek prime minister said if Greece failed, Europe\u2019s leaders would have a bigger disaster on their hands because \u201cit will be the beginning of the end of the eurozone\u201d. As talks with creditors in Brussels continued over Greece\u2019s proposed reforms in exchange for bailout funds, Tsipras was forced to make a fresh appeal in Athens for his own Syriza party to back him. His warning on the fate of the eurozone came after what appeared to be a coordinated move by world leaders at the G7 summit to caution Athens against resisting demands by its troika of creditors \u2013 the European commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank \u2013 for further austerity and far-reaching reforms. The US president, Barack Obama, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said the Greek people should accept the need for painful reforms to put the country on a sound financial footing. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said that if the gap between both sides was unbridgeable and Greece left the eurozone, the currency bloc had sufficient funds to cushion the blow. In an interview with Italy\u2019s Corriere Della Sera, Tsipras said the suggestion that a Grexit would be easily manageable was flawed. Instead, he argued, it would trigger the unravelling of the whole European project. \u201cI think it\u2019s obvious. It would be the beginning of the end of the eurozone. If the European political leadership cannot handle a problem like that of Greece, which accounts for 2% of its economy, what would the reaction of the markets be to countries facing much larger problems, such as Spain or Italy which has \u20ac2tn of public debt? He argued that a deal between Greece and her creditors could be close and pledged to discuss recent progress with Merkel and Hollande at the EU-Latin America summit on Wednesday. But EU officials did little to hide their frustration at what they see as Greece\u2019s lack of compromise in the reform negotiations. \u201cWe will do everything to keep Greece in the eurozone ... but our patience is running out,\u201d said the Finnish finance minister, Alexander Stubb. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, did not share Greece\u2019s optimism over a deal being within grasp. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of optimism from the Greek side and it\u2019s an underestimation of the complexity of what\u2019s being asked of them,\u201d Dijsselbloem told the Dutch RTL Nieuws TV station. Officials said a revised seven-page plan \u2013 the previous plan ran to 47 pages \u2013 had been received in Brussels, but that it was insufficient as the basis for renewed talks, without giving details of any new concessions by the radical leftist Syriza-led government in Athens. \u201cWhat has been submitted is not sufficient and not acceptable to member states to move the process forward,\u201d one official told Reuters. It is understood the proposals include higher VAT rates on some products to bring the Greek budget surplus closer to the 1% troika demand for 2015. However, Tsipras has resisted calls for a rapid rise in the effective retirement age, restricting early retirement applications by hundreds of thousands of Greeks. Officials close to the bailout talks said a previous plan was being considered that extended the current rescue programme through to March 2016, when the IMF\u2019s participation in Greece\u2019s bailout officially expires. Dusting off proposals for an extension would allow Athens to prepare for what everyone is now calling the \u201cbig agreement\u201d \u2013 a third bailout of between \u20ac40bn to \u20ac50bn that Athens undoubtedly needs to survivein the coming years. The idea of an extension was floated at the highest level of German policymaking several months ago, according to Greek insiders. Sources said delays in the current talks meant there was not enough time to agree a credible deal that will stick. \u201cAfter the summer, we don\u2019t have any big [debt] payments until March 2016, which in effect would be crunch time,\u201d said one well-placed source who requested anonymity simply because speculation is now running so high. \u201cThat would be the time that the government would have to come to a big agreement.\u201d An extension would buy Tsipras time \u2013 and some wiggle room to deal with Syriza\u2019s hard-left faction. Even if a \u201cshort-term\u201d deal is eventually clinched, as it is expected to be in the coming days, the anti-austerity government will face enormous difficulties. The Greek prime minister used a meeting of Syriza\u2019s political committee to call for unity on Tuesday. \u201cAlexis Tsipras believes we are now at the most crucial point of the negotiations and the party must play a substantial role in supporting the government in this effort,\u201d a government official said after the meeting. The Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said a deal would have to be a permanent deal: \u201cThe Greek government wants an agreement-solution. It wants this to be the last negotiation. The Greek people deserve it.\u201d",
