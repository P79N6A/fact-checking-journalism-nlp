      "bodyText": "The importance of China to our economy over the past 15 years can hardly be overstated, but with that importance comes risks. A new study by researchers at the IMF looks at the links between the Australian and Chinese economies and examines the risks to Australia from both positive and negative shocks to the Chinese economy \u2013 and concludes that the best mitigation is to continue to diversify our economy towards the services sector and also to other Asian markets. The importance of China to Australia is perhaps best demonstrated by the change in the amount of our merchandise exports that go to that country now compared to 15 years ago. Back in 2003 China took 7% of our merchandise exports \u2013 less than went to Japan and Korea. Now it takes 32.7% \u2013 more than goes to not only every other nation, but more than goes to all non-Asian nations combined: And while the focus of our exports to China generally is on iron ore and coal, the IMF report notes the importance of our services sector \u2013 especially tourism and education \u2013 as China itself moves towards a more services-consumer driven economy. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday In the past decade the number of Chinese visitors to Australia each year has grown 273% compared to just 43% for all other nations. And with that increase has also come a massive rise in the amount they spend here each year: A big reason for the increase is not just holiday makers, but students. While students make up just 7% of all visitors they account for 37% of all money spent in Australia \u2013 more than any other group: And because a higher share of Chinese visitors to Australia come for education than most other nations that means overall Chinese visitors spend more on average than those from other nations. In 2017 Chinese visitors spent on average $6,622 compared to $3,589 for those from India and just $2,934 for those from the UK. But even though UK tourist here for a holiday spend more on average than Chinese tourists, in all other categories \u2013 including business and employment reasons \u2013 Chinese spend more on average: The importance of Chinese students to our economy is highlighted by the fact that while they account for 36% of those travelling to Australia for educational purposes, they spend nearly half of all money in Australia by such visitors: So clearly there is more to our relationship with China than just mining exports. And this is clearly evident in the IMF study, which considers three shocks to the Chinese economy \u2013 two positive and one negative. The first involves China shifting faster than expected from a saving to a consumption driven economy. In this scenario, not surprisingly the result for Australia is mostly positive. The study finds that this would lead to a short-term boost to our services sector and while movements in the exchange rate would mean the benefits would be reduced in the long term, overall there is little cause for worry. The second positive shock involves the Chinese government moving to deal with overcapacity issues and low productivity. This would see it close its inefficient steel-producing firms \u2013 which would reduce steel production capacity by 10% \u2013 and also reduce its domestic supply of iron ore and coal by 5%. Crucially, this would not reduce the Chinese demand for iron ore and coal, so international commodity prices would actually rise. Such a move would have two ramifications for Australia. The commodity price rise would be good for our mineral exporters, but because the reduced steel production would also reduce Chinese national income that in turn would see a fall in the demand for tourism and education. Under this scenario the value of our dollar would also rise \u2013 in line with the increase in commodity prices \u2013 which would also make tourism and education in Australia more expensive for Chinese. The study estimates this would also lead to our GDP being slightly lower, but this overall small drop hides a large change within our economy. The mining sector would be fine, but our services sector would suffer a big decline and our national consumption would also fall in line with jobs cuts in the tourism and education sectors. The final shock is the hardest for Australia to deal with \u2013 one where the transition in the Chinese economy does not go smoothly and its productivity growth is lower than expected leading to its real GDP being 5% lower in the long term. This leads to lower demand for our exports \u2013 both minerals and services. The study estimates however that while our real GDP would fall initially \u201cby about 0.4 percent\u201d it would rebound in the long run. However, this again masks the real struggles that would occur. Firstly commodity prices would fall \u2013 meaning our national income would also drop. But because that our exchange rate would fall, tourism and education in Australia would become cheaper. The problem as China is our biggest market for education and general tourism the rest of the world would have to take up the slack \u2013 and those from such nations spend less on average than the Chinese do. And this is where the study highlights the need for our economy to remain diversified \u2013 both in terms of our exports having both mining and services sectors, but also in term of who we export to. The study notes that a faltering China, and the resultant drop in commodity prices would actually provide a boost to other emerging Asian economies. The report concludes that \u201cChina may be Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, but the rest of Asia is also rapidly growing, and is a potential market for Australia\u2019s future expansion\u201d. While China may have been the great driver of our economy over the past 15 years, the future looks likely to see the rest of Asia take a greater role \u2013 something we should be seeking, if only to mitigate the risk should the Chinese economy falter. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "Tiffany &amp; Co, the famed New York jeweller that last year hired Lady Gaga as its pitchwoman, has blown up analysts\u2019 estimates for first-quarter sales and raised its full-year forecast for profit. Shares in the company, made famous by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s, surged 20% and were on track for their best day in more than 17 years. The brand\u2019s plan to target new millennial customers paid off with a China-led 28% jump in Asian sales and a strong 9% jump in its domestic US market. Sales in Europe were up 13%. \u201cWith local customers the trend has been positive in every single region including Europe,\u201d Alessandro Bogliolo, the chief executive, told Reuters. Tiffany\u2019s turnaround strategy involved not only targeting young consumers but lowering the cost of jewellery and introducing more items more often. The turnaround was led by Reed Krakoff, the designer who turned the struggling leather-crafter Coach into a $5bn handbag retail giant. Krakoff was hired to strip the 181-year-old company of its \u201cWaspy\u201d formality. He introduced a novel range called Everyday Objects, which included a $165 pizza-cutter and $425 protractors made of sterling silver. A new range, Paper Flowers, includes platinum bracelets, pendants and earrings. The centrepiece is reportedly a diamond bib necklace dressed in 68 carats of round and pear-shaped diamonds. The bib necklace takes five months to make. The designer told Business of Fashion it was \u201cabout stripping away all of the rules associated with fine jewellery\u201d. Tiffany\u2019s prices for the items range from $2,500 to $790,000. Krakoff also signed Lady Gaga to front the brand before her Super Bowl half-time performance last year. The 60-second commercial by British photographer David Sims and Welsh styling legend Grace Coddington had Gaga speaking unscripted about her creative process, the importance of self-expression and empowerment.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Chairmen, especially those embarrassed by the share price on their watch, feel obliged to examine any old merger or acquisition idea. But there are limits to what counts as credible and Barclays\u2019 John McFarlane was seriously off-piste if he thought shareholders would be remotely interested in a corporate combination with Standard Chartered. The idea provoked inevitable derision in the City. First, Barclays\u2019 entire strategy for the past three years has been to reinvent itself as a US-UK \u201ctransatlantic bank\u201d, minus its former African business. Merging with Standard, which operates almost exclusively in Asia and Africa, would be a U-turn too far. Second, regulators would probably demand substantially bigger capital buffers, thereby negating the appeal of Standard\u2019s Asian deposit base. Third, the potential to rip out costs, banks\u2019 usual justification for big mergers, would barely exist. Barclays\u2019 \u201cexploratory conversations\u201d, according to the FT\u2019s report, were prompted by the perceived need to have a plan B to hand when the unsmiling agitator Edward Bramson turns rough. Bramson\u2019s Sherborne fund has bought a 5.4% interest in Barclays and a confrontation of some form is inevitable because that is how activists justify their fees. McFarlane and colleagues should drop their \u201cblue sky\u201d bumbling. Barclays\u2019 share price, stuck around the 210p mark, is unimpressive but a panicky mega-deal could make things worse. Their thinking should be simple. If the board trusts the chief executive, Jes Staley, to grind out higher returns over time, let the strategy run. If it doesn\u2019t, it should not have approved his plans in the first place. Bramson\u2019s beef is assumed to be about Barclays\u2019 investment bank. Should the bank even be in a capital-hungry business dominated by big American firms? Bramson will probably offer a few sharp criticisms and, actually, it\u2019s right that Barclays should be made to explain why dismantling its unreliable investment bank is supposedly too expensive to contemplate. But give the detailed rebuttal, don\u2019t play silly games of fantasy mergers. Most of all, remember that Bramson is merely a 5% short-termist punter who may have overreached in trying to call the tune at a large regulated bank. He should not be a source of terror. M&amp;S has time to save itself It was a \u201chistoric day\u201d for Marks &amp; Spencer, declared the chairman, Archie Norman, and he wasn\u2019t talking about the record \u00a3514m \u201cadjusting item\u201d hit to profits, which beat even last year\u2019s \u00a3437m whack. Rather, M&amp;S was offering the first warts-and-all assessment of its troubles for ages, Norman said. The list of woes was certainly long: too many stores; stores in the wrong places; a website that is too slow; a distribution centre that cannot cope with peak demand; dated IT systems; an inefficient supply chain in food; and, as the chief executive, Steve Rowe, put it, a corporate culture that was \u201ctop heavy\u201d and \u201cinward looking\u201d. Given that none of those items can be considered minor, you can understand why the promised turnaround is pitched as a \u201cthree-to-five-year\u201d job. Does M&amp;S have the luxury of time? Up to a point, it does. The size and scope of the \u201cadjustments\u201d is extraordinary but, in terms of hard cash, the cost of the rejig to the store portfolio remains unchanged at \u00a3200m. Meanwhile, M&amp;S is still generating plenty of cash from operations and net debt was reduced from \u00a31.9bn to \u00a31.8bn last year. Under a microscope, it is even possible to see an improvement in womenswear sales, one of the key areas of focus. The share price rose 5%, probably reflecting M&amp;S\u2019 confidence in a same-again dividend of 18.7p. The yield is 6% if you believe the annual distribution is permanently safe. That\u2019s not the worst long-term gamble in a horrible retail sector, even if one suspects more than 100 stores will eventually have to close. M&amp;S still has time to save itself.",

First, Barclays\u2019 entire strategy for the past three years has been to reinvent itself as a US-UK \u201ctransatlantic bank\u201d, minus its former African business. Merging with Standard, which operates almost exclusively in Asia and Africa, would be a U-turn too far. Second, regulators would probably demand substantially bigger capital buffers, thereby negating the appeal of Standard\u2019s Asian deposit base.

Barclays\u2019 share price, stuck around the 210p mark, is unimpressive but a panicky mega-deal could make things worse. Their thinking should be simple.

Should the bank even be in a capital-hungry business dominated by big American firms? Bramson will probably offer a few sharp criticisms and, actually, it\u2019s right that Barclays should be made to explain why dismantling its unreliable investment bank is supposedly too expensive to contemplate. But give the detailed rebuttal, don\u2019t play silly games of fantasy mergers.</p> <p>Most of all, remember that Bramson is merely a 5% short-termist punter who may have overreached in trying to call the tune at a large regulated bank.

      "bodyText": "Tina Green, the wife of Sir Philip Green and ultimate owner of the Arcadia Group, was paid \u00a325m by the retail empire last year despite a near wipeout of profits at its flagship Topshop brand. Lady Green, 68, who is based with her 66-year-old husband in the tax haven of Monaco, was made the controlling party of Taveta, the parent of Arcadia, at the turn of the century. According to accounts filed at Companies House this week, Lady Green received a \u00a325m payment from Taveta linked to transactions involving the collapsed department store chain BHS. Taveta redeemed \u00a320m of loan notes and paid interest of \u00a35m relating to the purchase of BHS from the family in 2009. Accounts show Taveta still owes the Green family nearly \u00a365m for the failed department store, down from \u00a387m last year. After a tough few years in which Sir Philip agreed to pay \u00a3363m to support the BHS\u2019s pension fund after calls for his knighthood to be stripped away, the Green family\u2019s wealth was marked down \u00a3787m to \u00a32bn in this year\u2019s Sunday Times Rich List. The Taveta accounts also reveal that a company led by Lady Green\u2019s son from her first marriage, the property developer Brett Palos, was paid almost \u00a3900,000 to manage a redevelopment of an unnamed store. In 2016 Lady Green defended the couple\u2019s use of what has been described as a \u201ccomplex web\u201d of companies based in tax havens that sit behind the family\u2019s retail empire. She made the statement in response to MPs investigating the collapse of the high street retailer BHS, which Green sold in 2015 to Dominic Chappell, a former racing driver, only for it to fold a year later. Topshop\u2019s pre-tax profits dived 99% to \u00a3909,000 in the year to 26 August 2017 amid rising costs and as sales slid 5.8% to \u00a3933.6m, according to the Companies House accounts. Sales in the UK dived nearly 8% to \u00a3846m. The flagship chain\u2019s poor performance contributed to a 5.6% fall in sales at Green\u2019s retail empire \u2013 including a 7.3% slide in the UK. Underlying profits for the continuing businesses of Taveta dived 42% to \u00a3124m. Pre-tax profits rose from \u00a336.8m to \u00a353.5m after a disastrous 2016. In 2015 the retail group made a profit of \u00a3172.2m. Taveta\u2019s pension liability fell to \u00a3300m from \u00a3426.8m a year before as the group topped up its contributions by \u00a325.6m to \u00a350m a year and changed some of the assumptions used to calculate the deficit. The hefty deficit is likely to remain a potential stumbling block to any sale of Arcadia, which Green is rumoured to be looking to exit. In February, Green denied he was in talks to sell Arcadia to the Chinese textiles firm Shandong Ruyi. A spokesman for Taveta declined to comment.",

      "bodyText": "After a positive couple of days, European markets fell sharply as investors cashed in come of their gains amid renewed political concerns. President Trump\u2019s negative comments on the US-China trade talks prompted renewed fears of a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, while he also suggested the much hyped meeting with North Korea might not now take place. There were also some disappointing eurozone growth and consumer confidence figures, while Italy\u2019s new coalition government continued to unsettle investors. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 89.01 points or 1.13% lower at 7788.44 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.47% to 12,976.84 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.32% at 5565.85 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.31% to 22,911.71 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.12% at 10,025.0 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 124 points or 0.5%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over in Turkey, the central bank has acted to stem a slide in the lira by raising one of its key lending rates to 16.5%. The bank lifted its late liquidity window rate by 300 basis points to 16.5%, in the wake of a more than 5% fall against the dollar earlier in the day, making a near 20% drop for the year. Investors have been nervous about President Erdogan\u2019s plans to tighten his grip on monetary policy. News of the rate increase saw the lira recover some ground to trade flat against the dollar. The FTSE 100 has closed below 7800 after reaching new peaks in recent days. Miners are among the leading fallers following President Trump\u2019s negative comments about the progress of US-China trade talks. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, said: Renewed fears over a potential trade war with China, in addition to concerns that OPEC could ease the self-imposed production cut in oil, sent the FTSE tumbling on Wednesday. Whilst the FTSE shed 1.3%, it was faring slightly better than its European peers thanks to the support of a significantly weaker pound. Commodity stocks dominated the lower reaches of the FTSE; miners, which are particularly sensitive to the health of the Chinese economy, were hit by concerns that a trade deal between the US and China may not ever be achieved, meaning trade tariffs and a potential trade war were suddenly, once again, very probable outcomes. Heading into the close of European trading, and markets have dropped sharply after the recent boom. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The atmosphere on equities this afternoon is gloomy, to say the least. The certainties of earlier in the week have ebbed away, and what\u2019s worse is that new worries have arrived to concern investors. Signs of d\u00e9tente between the US and China have decreased, reviving the great trade war fear, while the deterioration in Japanese and eurozone PMIs have sent chills down the spines of those hoping that the synchronised global expansion had further to run. Eurozone data in particular keeps getting worse, and the longer this goes on the more fears will rise that this \u2018transitory weakness\u2019 is not so transitory after all. All is not yet lost, particular for European markets, which have risen so dramatically in recent weeks, but the lack of progress in US stocks is beginning to prompt the spread of fear to other parts of the equity space as well. Back with the flagging eurozone consumer confidence figures, and ING Bank economist Peter Vanden Houte says it is hard to see stronger growth in the region in the coming months: Eurozone consumer confidence fell in May to 0.2 from a downward revised 0.3 in April. The strong increase in oil prices in the course of this month might have been one of the factors weighing on confidence. That said, the current confidence reading remains close to historical highs and based on long-run correlations, it is compatible with consumption growth between 2-2.5%. However, that is not what we have seen, as the current growth rate in consumption expenditure is closer to 1.5%. The disappointing performance of consumption in this recovery is not new. Since 2010, only three out of 32 quarters have seen year-on-year growth in consumer expenditure above overall GDP growth in the Eurozone. Although unemployment has now been falling five years in a row, it is still above pre-crisis levels. At the same time wage growth has remained very subdued. All of this means that consumption as a driving force in the growth story now comes even later in the cycle than usual. But for that to happen both employment and wage growth should have to pick up in the coming quarters and a further slide in sentiment should be avoided. A lot of conditions at this juncture. That\u2019s why we continue to see consumption as a growth support, but not strong enough to foster a genuine growth acceleration in the remainder of this year. After hitting $80 a share in recent days, oil prices have been slipping back and lost more ground after US stockpiles unexpectedly rose last week. US crude stocks rose by 5.8m barrels compared with forecasts of a decrease of 1.6m, showing demand was less than expected. Gasoline stocks climbed by 1.9m barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration, rather than the anticipated 1.4m barrel drop. So Brent crude has dipped 0.73% to $78.99 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, is down 0.9% at $71.54. Eurozone consumer confidence was slightly worse than expected in May, according to the latest figures from the European Commission. Its eurozone consumer confidence index dipped from 0.3 points in April to 0.2 points, compared to forecasts of an unchanged figure. In the wider European Union, sentiment rose by 0.4 points to -0.1 in May. Some positive US economic data, with higher manufacturing and service sector figures. IHS Markit\u2019s preliminary manufacturing PMI for May rose from 56.5 in April to 56.6, a 44 month high. Its services business activity index climbed from 54.6 to a three month high of 55.7, while the composite index went from 54.9 in April to 55.7. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: The flash May PMI surveys point to an encouragingly solid pace of economic growth of 2.5- 3% with monthly job gains running at just over 200,000, though the interesting action is coming on the prices front. Input costs measured across both manufacturing and services are rising at the fastest rate for nearly five years, with the goods-producing sector seeing the steepest cost increases for seven years in recent months. Furthermore, supplier delivery delays, a key forward-indicator of inflationary pressures, have risen to the highest seen in the 11 year survey history. Rising demand has stretched supply chains to the extent that suppliers are increasingly able to demand higher prices. At the same time, higher oil and energy prices are pushing up firms\u2019 costs. Business optimism meanwhile remains at a three- year high, with companies commonly expecting rising demand to help drive business growth, setting the scene for further strong survey results in coming months. US markets have followed their European counterparts into negative territory, as optimism over the US-China trade talks faded after comments from President Trump, who also suggested the planned summit with North Korea may not go ahead after all. Ahead of the latest minutes from the Federal Reserve, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 125 points or 0.49% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.38% lower and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.59%. It\u2019s time for some more outpourings from President Trump\u2019s twitter account, and this time it appears to be a jobs promise: The pound continues to come under pressure, down 0.9% against the dollar at $1.3316 and losing more than 2% against the Japanese yen, the second biggest daily drop this year. The unexpected fall in inflation in April has made an interest rate rise in August less likely, according to many commentators. But not everyone agrees: Here\u2019s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on today\u2019s inflation figures: UK inflation unexpectedly fell further last month to the lowest level in more than a year, as lower airfares provided some relief for cash-strapped Britons. The consumer price index dropped from 2.5% in March to 2.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Economists had expected the annual rate of growth in prices to remain unchanged. This decline will be welcomed by consumers under sharp pressure from rising prices since the Brexit vote, when a sudden drop in the value of the pound pushed up the cost of imported goods. While the impact from sterling\u2019s fall has started to fade, economists reckoned higher fuel prices would force inflation to remain above the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%. The latest fall raises fresh questions for Threadneedle Street, after the bank delayed raising interest rates earlier this month as a consequence of weak economic growth and inflation falling further than expected in March. The pound dropped by two-thirds of a cent against the dollar on foreign exchanges, reaching a five-month low of $1.3370. The ONS said airfares provided the biggest downward contribution, due to the timing of Easter. Airlines typically raise their prices around the holiday, although the ONS said it had found no impact this year because Easter fell between its March and April price collection periods. Soft drink prices had their biggest increase for this time of year, rising sharply in March and April following the introduction of the sugar tax. However, Mike Hardie of the ONS said many retailers had yet to pass on the impact of the levy to shoppers. More here: Back in the UK, new data has confirmed that London\u2019s housing market has come firmly off the boil. Property prices in the capital have fallen by 0.7% in the last year - making London the only part of the UK with negative house price inflation. Our personal finance editor Patrick Collinson explains: Property experts in London said buyers are \u201csensing blood in the water\u201d with sellers forced to cut prices steeply to ensure a sale. Jonathan Hopper of Garrington Property Finders said: \u201cLondon is paying a painfully high price for its stellar run of price rises, and a correction is now under way in several parts of the capital. \u201cSellers are being forced to trim their expectations, and astute buyers are increasingly sensing blood in the water.\u201d Newsflash: Breaking away from UK inflation, US media conglomerate Comcast has just announced it is preparing an all-cash offer for most of Twenty-First Century Fox - Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire. That\u2019s a fascinating development, because Murdoch has agreed to sell 21CF to Disney for $52.4bn. Comcast has already tried to gatecrash the 21CF-Disney deal by bidding for UK broadcaster Sky, challenging Fox\u2019s own bid for Sky (it already owns a 39% stake). It is now upping the stakes and trying to thwart Disney by acquiring 21CF for itself. Comcast, which owns NBC Universal and Universal Pictures, says it will beat Disney\u2019s offer, telling investors. Any offer for Fox would be all-cash and at a premium to the value of the current all-share offer from Disney. Today\u2019s slide means the pound has now lost 10 whole cents against the US dollar since 16 April, when it was worth $1.43. This slide was triggered by Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who warned that weak economic data and Brexit uncertainty might hold back interest rate increases. The ongoing cabinet infighting over Britain\u2019s future customs relationships with the EU has also weakened sterling, as it raises the chances of a hard Brexit. A weak pound drives up inflation, by making imports pricier., and several experts are predicting that inflation will rise again later this year. Joel Dungate, investment analyst at investment management and stockbroking firm Redmayne Bentley, explains: There are reasons why future inflation may move back up. In recent weeks, the price of oil has risen sharply and the value of the Pound has fallen again, both of which could drive up the costs of goods. In addition, recent data showed that wage growth had overtaken inflation, putting more money into the pockets of consumers. In theory this could increase demand and push prices higher.\u201d Brent crude oil hit its highest levels since 2014 last week, at over $80 per barrel. Rob Scammell, senior portfolio manager at Kempen Capital Management, believes this will hit consumers in the pocket. \u201cOil price rises have not yet fed through to the UK \u2013 but this could be just a matter of time. With a further 10% rise in oil in sterling terms over the last month, it seems unlikely that this restraint can last for long. Could someone hand the pound a sponge and a towel? Sterling has now shed a whole cent against the US dollar to $1.3328 (still a 5-month low). Although the inflation rate dropped last month, it\u2019s important to note that the cost of living is still higher than a year ago. Each of the main areas - food, transport, housing costs - cost more in April 2018 than April 2017, as this chart shows: The report shows that food prices have risen 2.4% in the last year (including a 5.8% jump in fish prices). Soft drinks cost 6.2% more than in April 2017 (thanks to the sugar tax), while tobacco is 6.1% pricier. Clothing costs are up by 1.7%, while furniture is up 2.4%. Although air fares were 7.9% cheaper year-on-year (due to the early Easter), this was balanced out by a 4.2% increase in the cost of new cars. The pound has dropped to fresh five-month lows against the US dollar, as the chances of an early UK interest rate rise drop sharply. Sterling is now down almost a cent at $1.335, following the news that UK inflation dropped to 2.4% last month. However, Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG in the UK, predicts that the recent jump in the oil price could drop inflation up in the coming months. She says: \u201cPrices of goods, including furnishing, household appliances, clothing and footwear, moderated in April. At the same time, the cost of services, including hotels and communication packages, were on the rise. This is partially a reflection of the diminishing impact on import prices from the sharp depreciation of the pound following the EU referendum, and increasing domestic inflationary pressures as the labour market tightens further and spare capacity wanes. \u201cWith oil prices on the up and domestic price pressures unabated, we may not see further falls in inflation this year.\u201d Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool agrees that the case for the Bank of England raising interest rates in August is fading. He explains: The 2.4% CPI inflation reading for April is already (slightly) lower than the most likely outcome (the so called \u2018mode\u2019) of 2.43% predicted for the second quarter of 2018 by the MPC\u2019s Inflation Report only a few weeks earlier. If CPI inflation falls further in May, they will most likely have to revise their inflation forecasts downwards which will obviously make the case for an August interest rate hike even weaker. Newsflash: Investors have slashed the chances of a UK interest rate hike in August to just a third: That underlines why the pound has fallen -- lower interest rates mean there is less incentive to hold sterling. David Lamb, head of dealing at Fexco Corporate Payments, says the City is right: \u201cBritain\u2019s next interest rate rise hasn\u2019t just been kicked into the long grass, it has been sent sailing right out of the park. \u201cWith consumer inflation continuing to fall \u2013 even in the face of rising fuel prices \u2013 the Bank of England is running out of reasons to raise rates. \u201cBy contrast it has every reason to keep rates on hold. With CPI now falling to within touching distance of the Bank\u2019s 2% target of its own accord, the last thing Mark Carney and Co will want to do is upset the faltering economy with a rate hike. Predictably, the government has welcomed today\u2019s decline in in inflation, while the opposition points out that real wages are still too low. For the government, financial secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride says: \u201cInflation falling and real wages on the rise means more money in people\u2019s pockets. We are helping families earn more and keep more of what they earn by cutting taxes for 31 million people and increasing the National Living Wage, worth an extra \u00a32,000. \u201cWe must continue to ensure people\u2019s pay outstrips inflation and build an economy that truly works for everyone. But Peter Dowd MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, says workers need more help: \u201cInflation remains higher than the Bank of England\u2019s target, while working people are struggling with real earnings still lower than in 2010, following eight years of Tory economic failure. The next Labour government will introduce a \u00a310 per hour Real Living Wage to tackle the squeeze on wages, and build a high wage, high skill economy for the many, not the few.\u201d Today\u2019s report also shows the impact of Britain\u2019s new sugar tax. Prices for mineral waters, soft drinks and juices jumped by 2.8% in April, as some retailers passed on a new levy on beverages packed with sugar. That\u2019s a chunky increase, but not enough to prevent the wider inflation rate falling. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the Office for National Statistics, explains: \u201cInflation continued to slow in April, with air fares making the biggest downward contribution, due to the timing of Easter. This was partially offset by the rise in petrol prices. \u201cSoft drink prices saw their biggest ever rise for this time of year, due to the introduction of the sugar tax. However, many retailers still haven\u2019t passed the impact of the tax onto shoppers. Martin Lane, managing editor of money.co.uk, has welcomed the drop in UK inflation to a 13-month low: \u201cThe nation can breathe a small sigh of relief. Inflation has fallen, so the pounds in our pockets aren\u2019t being stretched quite as far. The pressure on our wages is easing and the gap between inflation and wage growth has disappeared, easing the strain on our wallets. Something else consumers will be grateful for in the run up to holiday season, is the cost of items like food and airfares are slowing. But consumes should still be cautious, Lane adds: \u201cWith inflation at a one year low of 2.4% and no interest rises yet it may seem like a great time to spend spend spend. However, there are still interest rate rises looming on the horizon, so it isn\u2019t the time for you to splash your cash just yet. Use the good times to prepare your finances for when they aren\u2019t so great. Create a budget and spend 30 minutes looking at where you could make savings, from switching where you do your weekly shop to changing your energy supplier. Half an hour of research and admin could save you hundreds, if not thousands a year.\u201d Kevin Doran, chief investment officer at stockbroker AJ Bell, warns that the drop in inflation may not last. \u201cUK consumers will be glad to see average wage increases starting to outstrip inflation and for the spending power of the pound in their pocket pick up further. \u201cHowever, the recent weakness in the pound and the rising oil price are a concern and could quickly reverse the drop in inflation. The jump in the oil price has started to hit petrol pumps, pushing up costs for UK consumers and businesses alike. In addition, the weak pound will be driving up input costs for many UK companies which will ultimately filter through to UK consumers in the coming months. \u201cIf inflation does increase, UK consumers will once again start to feel the pinch. Wage growth is currently only marginally ahead of inflation at 2.6% and interest rates on cash savings remain rock bottom so rising prices will weaken the spending power of both earnings and savings.\u201d The drop in inflation in April suggests that real wages in the UK are still growing, at a modest pace. The latest data shows that average basic pay in Britain (excluding bonuses) rose by 2.9% per year in the first quarter of 2018. Total pay (including bonuses) rose by 2.6%, or barely ahead of the cost of living. Why did the unusually early Easter helped to pull inflation down last month? Easter Sunday fell on 1 April, two weeks earlier than in 2017. Airlines usually put prices up as people either jet off for holidays, or travel home - but this year, that rush began in March. The ONS explains: The timing of Easter in the middle of April 2017 contributed to air fares rising by 18.6% on the month whereas this year, Easter fell at the beginning of April before the price collection period and there was no price rise. Instead, fares fell slightly, by 0.2%, between March and April. Core inflation, which strips out volatile items, has fallen to just 2.1% from 2.3% in March. That\u2019s another sign of cooling inflationary pressures. The pound has fallen to a new five-month low, as the City reacts to today\u2019s unexpectedly weak inflation report. Sterling has shed three quarters of a cent against the US dollar to $1.3348, its lowest point since the end of December. The Bank of England\u2019s mandate is to keep CPI near to 2%; traders are calculating that today\u2019s drop in inflation reduces the chances of an interest rate rise in August. Food and men\u2019s clothing prices helped to pull inflation down last month, alongside the impact of cheaper air fares. The Office for National Statistics says: Clothing and footwear also had a downward effect, with prices rising by 0.4% between March and April 2018 compared with a larger rise of 1.1% between the same two months a year earlier. The effect came mainly from men\u2019s clothing. A smaller downward contribution came from food and non-alcoholic beverages. This was from a range of food products with the largest single effect from meat, where prices fell this year but rose a year ago, particularly for cooked ham. The downward contribution from food was partially offset by an upward effect from mineral waters, soft drinks and juices, where prices rose by 2.8% between March and April this year compared with a rise of 0.3% a year ago. Cheaper air fares helped to pull inflation down last month, and make up for higher petrol prices at the pumps. The ONS says: The largest downward contribution to the change in the rate came from air fares, which were influenced by the timing of Easter. Rising prices for motor fuels produced the largest, partially offsetting, upward effect. Newsflash: Uk inflation has fallen to a new one-year. The consumer prices index - the headline measure of inflation - rose by 2.4% in April, down from 2.5% in March. More to follow! Newsflash: Growth across the eurozone has fallen to its lowest level in 18 months. Data firm Markit reports that activity and new orders at eurozone companies is expanding at a slower rate this month, with a knock-on effect on confidence and job creation. German and France suffered the sharpest slowdown, Markit says. This pulled Markit\u2019s flash PMI index down to 54.1 in May, from 55.1 in April (the data is based on interviews with purchasing managers at eurozone companies) . Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the eurozone economy is losing momentum after a strong 2017 \u201cThe May PMI brought yet another set of disappointing survey results, though once again a note of caution is required when interpreting the findings. While prior months have seen various factors such as extreme weather, strikes, illness and the timing of Easter dampen growth, May saw reports of business being adversely affected by an unusually high number of public holidays. Furthermore, despite the headline PMI dropping to an 18-month low, the survey remains at a level consistent with the eurozone economy growing at a reasonably solid rate of just over 0.4% in the second quarter. Piet Christiansen of Danske Bank says this weakness will deter the European Central Bank from tightening its monetary policy next month. Those trade worries have dragged Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 away from yesterday\u2019s record high. The blue-chip index is down almost 50 points at 7829, a drop of 0.6%. European stock markets are in the red this morning, as anxiety over a potential trade war between America and China ripples through trading floors again. Yesterday, president Trump declared that he\u2019s \u2018not satisfied\u2019 with the progress of trade talks with China. This has fuelled worries that negotiations with Beijing could falter, just few days after the two sides stepped back from imposing tariffs on each other\u2019s goods. Trump is also facing a backlash back home, over his efforts to protect Chinese telecoms firm ZTE from US sanctions. Republicans in Congress are drawing up legislation that would block the White House\u2019s attempt to save ZTE - which could undermine Trump\u2019s efforts to improve relations with Beijing: Economist Rupert Seggins predicts that the rising oil price has pushed transport inflation up, while food price inflation has slowed: BS Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover if Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze is getting any easier, when the latest UK inflation figures are released. Economists predict that consumer prices rose by 2.5% in the year to April, matching March\u2019s unexpectedly low inflation reading. That would mean wages are, thankfully, outpacing inflation - average basic pay grew by 2.9% in the year to March. Any drop in inflation would clearly be welcomed by UK consumer, who have suffered from falling real wages last year. As the Bank of England pointed out yesterday, households are \u00a3900 poorer than expected two years ago. But, falling inflation would take pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates. Traders are split over whether the BoE will take the plunge in August, so they\u2019ll be scrutinising the data closely. The pound has already weakened this morning to a five-month low. Sterling has shed half a cent against the US dollar to $1.3376, its lowest level since the end of December 2017. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, says a weak inflation report could sent sterling lower: Sterling rallied higher yesterday on the back of somewhat bullish remarks from BoE economist Gertjan Vlieghe that mentioned that he sees more rate hikes ahead but as we highlighted in our previous note the market doesn\u2019t seem to agree. The rally to $1.35 was treated as an opportunity to go short on the pound and if today\u2019s inflation report prints soft as expected sterling could break below $1.34 en route to the $1.33 floor. Royal Bank of Canada predict that CPI will be unchanged at 2.5%: Falling fuel prices helped inflation fall more than expected in recent months but that effect looks to have reversed in April with pump prices rising 1.6% m/m. There is some offset from the timing of Easter. We also get a new healthcheck on the eurozone economy this morning. Data firm Markit\u2019s latest survey of purchasing managers is expected to show steady growth this month. Plus, the latest oil inventory figures from America could move energy prices; last week they helped to push Brent crude over $80 per barrel.

Signs of d\u00e9tente between the US and China have decreased, reviving the great trade war fear, while the deterioration in Japanese and eurozone PMIs have sent chills down the spines of those hoping that the synchronised global expansion had further to run. Eurozone data in particular keeps getting worse, and the longer this goes on the more fears will rise that this \u2018transitory weakness\u2019 is not so transitory after all.</p> <p>All is not yet lost, particular for European markets, which have risen so dramatically in recent weeks, but the lack of progress in US stocks is beginning to prompt the spread of fear to other parts of the equity space as well.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b058045e4b05aef3eee91e9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-23T14:55:51.963Z\">3.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the flagging eurozone consumer confidence figures, and ING Bank economist Peter Vanden Houte says it is hard to see stronger growth in the region in the coming months:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Eurozone consumer confidence fell in May to 0.2 from a downward revised 0.3 in April. The strong increase in oil prices in the course of this month might have been one of the factors weighing on confidence. That said, the current confidence reading remains close to historical highs and based on long-run correlations, it is compatible with consumption growth between 2-2.5%. However, that is not what we have seen, as the current growth rate in consumption expenditure is closer to 1.5%.</p> <p>The disappointing performance of consumption in this recovery is not new. Since 2010, only three out of 32 quarters have seen year-on-year growth in consumer expenditure above overall GDP growth in the Eurozone. Although unemployment has now been falling five years in a row, it is still above pre-crisis levels. At the same time wage growth has remained very subdued. All of this means that consumption as a driving force in the growth story now comes even later in the cycle than usual. But for that to happen both employment and wage growth should have to pick up in the coming quarters and a further slide in sentiment should be avoided. A lot of conditions at this juncture. That\u2019s why we continue to see consumption as a growth support, but not strong enough to foster a genuine growth acceleration in the remainder of this year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b057cbce4b0a1f8347716e9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-23T14:41:53.762Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Brent slips after surprise rise in US oil stocks</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After hitting $80 a share in recent days, oil prices have been slipping back and lost more ground after US stockpiles unexpectedly rose last week.</p> <p>US crude stocks rose by 5.8m barrels compared with forecasts of a decrease of 1.6m, showing demand was less than expected.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has reported a sharp fall in annual profits as it revealed a deterioration in clothing sales and extensive store closure costs. Pretax profits at the retail giant slumped 62% to \u00a366.8m after a \u00a3514.1m bill for restructuring that included \u00a3321m to pay for the first phase of its store closure plan. One in three of its core clothing and home stores is scheduled to disappear from the high street within four years and the group warned that a further \u00a3150m of closure costs would follow. Despite the slump in profits, M&amp;S chairman Archie Norman said it was a \u201chistoric day\u201d for the retailer as the new management team set out a clear plan to revive the business. \u201cWe are looking for people to recognise that we are building a very strong management team who are going to give this a bloody good shot,\u201d said Norman, who is best known for reviving the fortunes of Asda and ITV. \u201cI\u2019m convinced this is a turning point in our history.\u201d The chief executive, Steve Rowe, said major structural changes were affecting the retailer as sales transferred to the internet and no-frills chains such as Primark, Aldi and Lidl. On Tuesday the retailer said it would close 100 of its 300 high-street stores, which sell clothing, homewares and food, by 2022. Rowe said one of the biggest tasks was to change the company\u2019s culture as M&amp;S was a \u201ctop-heavy business that was inward looking and too \u2018corporate\u2019\u201d. \u201cThere are too many layers, too many committees, and it\u2019s too corporate,\u201d he said. M&amp;S expects a third of its clothing and homewares business to move online over the next five years. But Rowe admitted neither the website, which had a \u00a3150m revamp four years ago, or the hi-tech warehouse built in Castle Donington, Leicestershire, to support it were up to the job and more investment was now required. \u201cOur online capability is behind the best of our competitors and our website is too slow,\u201d said Rowe, admitting that product pages took too long to load and the search function was not good enough. \u201cOur fulfilment centre at Castle Donington has struggled to cope with peak demand and some of our systems are dated.\u201d M&amp;S said clothing sales in stores that have been open more than one year tumbled 3.4% in the fourth quarter as trading was hit by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d cold snap. That compared with a decline of 2.3% in the previous period. Total clothing sales were down 1.4% at \u00a33.7bn in the year to 31 March, and analysts warned that the retailer is at risk of losing its market leadership to Primark in 2018. Sales in M&amp;S\u2019s food halls also went backwards, with underlying sales down 0.6% in the three months to 31 March as it was outflanked in the competitive convenience store market. Rowe said M&amp;S\u2019s food halls needed to offer better value for money and to attract more families. To that end, it plans to develop a new type of store that would better appeal to this group of shopper. Rowe, who has been in charge for two years, did not rule out additional store closures. \u201cThis is a catch-up programme. We have got too many legacy stores and historically have not closed stores fast enough. We need to make sure we\u2019ve got an estate that is fit for the future.\u201d On an underlying basis, profits were down 5.4% at \u00a3580.9m. M&amp;S shares were the best performer on the FTSE 100 on Tuesday, closing up more than 5% at 307p, suggesting investors believed that the management was finally getting to grips with the company\u2019s problems. Despite the rally, M&amp;S\u2019s declining fortunes mean that its place in the prestigious FTSE 100 is at risk in next week\u2019s reshuffle. Norman was unconcerned about demotion to the FTSE 250, a fate that befell ITV before he took charge. \u201cRight now what you measure [at M&amp;S] is the pace of change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe financial results will follow.\u201d Russ Mould, a director at investment platform AJ Bell, said maintaining the dividend would encourage investors to hang on to their shares. \u201cRowe admits that it is going to be a long haul, as the goal now is to deliver sustainable, profitable growth \u2018within three to five years\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors now have to decide whether that\u2019s too long to be left waiting at the checkout.\u201d",

The FT said Barclays directors had held \u201cexploratory conversations\u201d about possible deals in response to pressure from Edward Bramson\u2019s US-based activist investment fund Sherborne, which has a 5.4% stake in the bank. John McFarlane, Barclays\u2019 chairman, was in favour of a deal with Standard Chartered, according to the FT, while Sir Gerry Grimstone, who chairs the Barclays International unit, was also said to be supportive of the idea. A private conversation took place between a director at each bank about the potential benefits of such a deal but no formal or informal bid approach had taken place, the FT said. Barclays declined to comment on the report. A spokesman for Standard Chartered said: \u201cWe are entirely focused on executing our strategy and do not comment on this type of speculation.\u201d Shares in Barclays were down 0.4% on Wednesday morning after the report was published, while Standard Chartered shares rose 2.2%. Sources close to Barclays poured cold water on the report and said the bank was not working on a deal with any of its rivals. Bramson is calling for a shake-up of the bank that is thought to involve a radical reduction in activities at its underperforming investment bank, in a plan to cut costs and boost shareholder returns. Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, met Bramson in New York earlier this month and was told by the activist investor that he was still working on his proposals for the bank\u2019s future. Also this month, Staley was fined \u00a3642,430 by UK regulators for a breach of conduct after he attempted to unmask a whistleblower. As well as being fined by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, Barclays said it would claw back \u00a3500,000 of Staley\u2019s bonus over the matter. The bank will also have to report annually to the regulators detailing how it handles whistleblowing after they expressed concerns about its existing systems.",

      "bodyText": "House prices in London tumbled in March, with the annualised rate of inflation dropping to minus 0.7%, the steepest fall since 2009, according to official Land Registry figures for March. The falls in the capital contrast with continued rises across the rest of the UK, with the overall rate of house price inflation at 4.2%, with the highest rise in Scotland at 6.7%. Property experts in London said buyers are \u201csensing blood in the water\u201d, with sellers forced to cut prices steeply to ensure a sale. Jonathan Hopper of Garrington Property Finders said: \u201cLondon is paying a painfully high price for its stellar run of price rises and a correction is now under way in several parts of the capital.\u201d The ONS, which compiles the house price index based on Land Registry data, said prices in London have been falling since the EU referendum in June 2016. \u201cThis is the lowest annual growth in London since September 2009, when it was negative 3.2%. London has shown a general slowdown in its annual growth rate since mid-2016. The second-lowest annual growth was in the north-east, where prices increased by 2.1% in the year to March 2018.\u201d The ONS said the average price of a home in the UK in March was \u00a3224,000, \u00a3500 less than the month before but \u00a39,000 higher than in March 2017. It is notable that the 4.2% annualised inflation figure recorded by the ONS is significantly higher than the figures from indices produced by Halifax and Nationwide, which stand at 2.2% and 2.1% respectively. Land Registry data is regarded as \u201cbackward looking\u201d as it records actual prices paid and then registered, compared to the indices from the lenders, which try to capture price activity at the point of sale. Separate figures from UK Finance reveal that transaction activity in the capital has declined over the past year. The number of first-time buyers fell by 3% while the number of home movers dropped by 4.3% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with the same period a year earlier. However, Sam Mitchell of estate agency HouseSimple.com said the picture outside London is very different. \u201cFor years we have talked about the north-south divide, with house prices in the north struggling to keep pace with booming price growth in the south. But that trend has been turned on its head,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cCompare London to Liverpool. While London house prices are in negative growth territory, in Liverpool, average prices are up 12.5% over the same period, making it one of the strongest property markets in the UK right now. Where affordability has been a major problem in the south of England, the north offers value, particularly for families looking for larger homes.\u201d Economists expect house price inflation to be around 2% in 2018, with some pencilling in only a modest recovery in 2019. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cThe latest data and survey evidence largely point to lacklustre housing market activity as it is pressurised by still-limited consumer purchasing power, fragile confidence and concerns of further gradual Bank of England interest rate rises following November\u2019s first hike since 2007. \u201cWe expect house price gains over 2018 will be limited to a modest 2%. At this stage, we expect prices to rise no more than 3% in 2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "UK inflation unexpectedly fell further last month to the lowest level in more than a year as lower airfares provided some relief for cash-strapped Britons. Triggering a sell-off in the pound to the lowest levels seen this year, the consumer price index dropped from 2.5% in March to 2.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Economists had expected the annual rate of growth in prices to remain unchanged. This decline will be welcomed by consumers under sharp pressure from rising prices since the Brexit vote, when a sudden drop in the value of the pound pushed up the cost of imported goods. While the impact from sterling\u2019s fall has started to fade, economists reckoned higher fuel prices would force inflation to remain above the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%. However, the latest drop raises fresh questions for Threadneedle Street after the Bank delayed raising interest rates earlier this month as a consequence of weak economic growth and inflation falling further than expected in March. The pound dropped by a cent against the dollar on foreign exchanges, reaching a five-month low of $1.3316. James Smith, an economist at the Dutch bank ING, said: \u201cIn principle, this takes some of the heat off the Bank of England to hike rates again in the near term \u2013 although it\u2019s worth remembering policymakers are still focused squarely on wage growth as a measure of underlying inflation.\u201d The ONS said airfares provided the biggest downward contribution for inflation, although it warned this was primarily down to Easter falling early in the month \u2013 a factor that could distort the inflation reading. Airlines typically raise their prices around Easter, yet the ONS said it had found no impact this year because the holiday fell between its March and April price collection periods. For this reason, economists said Bank officials were unlikely to change their view on the need for a rate hike. The timing of Easter in the middle of April last year contributed to air fares rising by 18.6% on the month, whereas this year, with Easter falling at the start of April prior to the ONS collecting its data, ticket costs for flights fell by 0.2%. Elsewhere, the latest snapshot from the government\u2019s statisticians showed soft drink prices had the biggest increase for this time of year, rising sharply in March and April following the introduction of the sugar tax. However, Mike Hardie of the ONS said many retailers had yet to pass on the impact of the levy to shoppers. Annual price growth for goods leaving factory gates remained unchanged last month, although the ONS said the cost of raw materials required by manufacturers rose, mainly driven by a strong increase in the crude oil price of more than 8% in the past month to nearly $80 a barrel. Economists said this could drive inflation higher in future months, as petrol stations push up their prices. There were already some early indicators as petrol prices rose by 1.2% last month. Andrew Sentance, the senior economic adviser at the accountancy firm PwC, said: \u201cThe most likely scenario therefore appears to be that UK inflation will remain stuck around 2.5% over the summer and could pick up in the next couple of months.\u201d Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said the latest fall was \u201cgood news\u201d for British households as wage growth continues to outstrip the rate of inflation. But Labour attacked the government for inflation running above the Bank\u2019s target rate of 2%. The most recent inflation figures come after Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, said every British household was about \u00a3900 worse off since the Brexit vote. However, a survey of leave voters by the consultancy firm Simon-Kucher found less than a fifth would change their vote because of price increases.",

      "bodyText": "Dairy Crest has announced plans to invest \u00a385m in the expansion of its cheese factory in Cornwall to meet growing demand for cheddar in markets such as China. The company behind the mature cheddar brands Cathedral City and Davidstow said the investment would be phased over the next five years and funded partly by the sale of \u00a370m of new shares to institutional investors. Mark Allen, the chief executive, said expansion of the factory was \u201cgreat news for the local area\u201d, providing certainty for its dairy farmers and workers, and creating jobs over the period. About 200 people are employed at the plant. To meet growing demand, Dairy Crest estimates it will need to increase annual cheese production at its Davidstow factory in Cornwall from 54,000 tonnes to up to 77,000 tonnes. The group, which also owns Country Life butter and Clover spread, hopes to capitalise on rising demand for mature cheese at home and abroad. Currently, 98% of Dairy Crest\u2019s cheese sales are in the UK, with 2% of exports going to Europe, predominantly to destinations popular among British holidaymakers. Allen said there was \u201cgood evidence\u201d that Chinese consumers were developing a taste for mature cheddar, with demand also growing in Europe, the US and east Asia, giving Dairy Crest the opportunity to bolster exports when it increases production. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that seven or eight years down the road we\u2019ll be at about 20% exports,\u201d he said. In the UK, the cheese market is growing at about 2% a year and Cathedral City is the No 1 brand, with a 20% share of the cheddar market. Expansion of its Cornwall factory will include investment in new technology and machinery as well as funding infrastructure for a self-sufficient water supply. About \u00a310m will be spent on new machinery to increase its use of recyclable packaging. Allen said it had been \u201ca year of considerable progress for Dairy Crest\u201d as the company announced the investment alongside its annual results. Group revenue rose 10% to \u00a3456.8m in the year to 31 March, while pre-tax profit increased by 3% to \u00a362.3m. Cathedral City was the main driver of growth over the year, outperforming the wider cheese market. Dairy Crest said it was a top-20 food grocery brand, \u201cfound in more than half of all fridges across the country\u201d. The group said snacking was a key part of its growth strategy for Cathedral City, which has launched a snack bar version available in most convenience stores.",

Wired world: M&amp;S faces greater competition as the internet has made it easier than ever to shop around, compare prices and access fashion from around the world. About a quarter of fashion and footwear is now bought online in the UK, says retail expert GlobalData, and the switch from the high street is benefiting the likes of Asos as well as dozens of smaller brands from Boden to Me+Em. M&amp;S has struggled to adapt. It made a massive investment in an automated home delivery warehouse which has struggled to cope with demand. Too many shops: M&amp;S is closing a third of its 300 high street stores which sell its full range of clothing, homewares and food. The radical plan will cut the amount of high street floor space devoted to clothing and homewares by a quarter but some question whether even that is going far enough in a digital age. Poor stores: After nearly 115 years on the high street, M&amp;S has collected a motley array of stores, some of which have seen better days. A lack of investment in small, local outlets has left them looking shabby and dated, while some of the larger stores are now too big and difficult to navigate. A lot of work has been done to improve matters, bringing in coffee shops and other services, but more work is needed to create truly exciting spaces. Fashion faux pas: A third of the nation still buys its undies at M&amp;S, but the chain has struggled to maintain its everywoman appeal for everyday clothing amid heavy competition. Middle-aged, and even elderly, women now expect to dress much more fashionably than they did in the past and M&amp;S has struggled to keep pace with their desires. Cutting quality in an attempt to bring prices closer to discounters such as Primark has backfired in the past. The group\u2019s multiple sub-brands, such as Per Una and Limited Edition, also lack authority and consistency and shoppers don\u2019t understand who they are aimed at. This is not just M&amp;S food \u2026 It\u2019s too expensive and rivals have caught up. After several years of bumper growth, M&amp;S food halls are lagging as rivals from Aldi and Lidl to upmarket Waitrose raise their game with the kinds of new products M&amp;S was once famous for. M&amp;S Inc: The business culture at M&amp;S has long been criticised for being too bureaucratic. Chief executive Steve Rowe admitted it is \u201ca top-heavy business that was inward looking and too \u2018corporate\u2019\u201d. After previous false dawns newish chairman Archie Norman is expected to be instrumental in bringing change. Peak stuff? M&amp;S is exposed to a shift in spending that is seeing Britons spend less on wardrobe updates. The volume of clothing and footwear sold in 2017 declined 0.8%, according to GlobalData, and is expected to fall again this year. At the same time, M&amp;S\u2019s traditionally middle-aged female shoppers have more choice that ever before thanks to fast fashion rivals such as Zara, H&amp;M and Primark.",

      "bodyText": "The government was too slow to spot mounting financial problems at troubled public sector outsourcing company Carillion, according to a report that reveals the Cabinet Office decided the contractor was not \u201chigh risk\u201d even as it neared insolvency. The parliamentary public accounts committee, which produced the report, also warned that Carillion\u2019s collapse indicates that too many public works contracts are concentrated in the hands of a few private firms. The PAC said that a lack of transparency around outsourcing to such companies risked creating an environment in which \u201cpoor practice takes root\u201d. \u201cThe Carillion papers identify clear and compelling problems with the business in the months leading to its collapse,\u201d said PAC committee chair and Labour MP Meg Hillier. \u201cGovernment had the opportunity to deal with them. Taxpayers, service users and people and businesses plunged into financial difficulty by Carillion\u2019s demise deserve to know what happened.\u201d Cabinet Office documents released by the PAC show officials were slow to realise the extent of the financial difficulties at Carillion, which derived \u00a3377m in annual revenues from government contracts. The Cabinet Office operates a traffic light scheme \u2013 with red as the most risky and green the least \u2013 assessing the finances of its \u201cstrategic suppliers\u201d. The red category is considered the last step before a company can be labelled \u201chigh risk\u201d, at which point the government should stop awarding them new contracts and seek to reduce any existing work. Carillion was not designated as red until July 2017, after it had issued its first profit warning to the market. \u201cIt appears the government was not aware of Carillion\u2019s financial distress until this point,\u201d the PAC said. Carillion continued to win lucrative government contracts after that. But in late November, nine days after it won a schools building contract, the Cabinet Office\u2019s commercial relationships board, which monitors strategic suppliers to government, recommended provisionally designating Carillion as high risk. In an internal memo, an official cited the financial condition of the company, which had issued three profit warnings by that point, and \u201cunder-performance\u201d on government contracts. The company was given 10 days to respond and at a commercial relationships board meeting on 15 December, a decision was taken not to elevate the company\u2019s risk status. Documents released by the PAC showed that Cabinet Office staff found that \u201cafter considering Carillion\u2019s representations on the matter we considered that it would not be beneficial to Her Majesty\u2019s government to allocate a high risk rating at this time\u201d. In comments accompanying the report, members of the PAC said the collapse of Carillion demonstrated the need for an overhaul of how public services are parcelled out to private firms. \u201cGovernment has become dependent on large contracts to deliver public projects and services,\u201d said Hiller. \u201cGreat secrecy surrounds them. If a company providing a number of these contracts fails, this is bad news for service users and the taxpayer.\u201d The government has already set aside \u00a3150m to cover the cost of managing the fall-out from Carillion\u2019s failure. Hillier\u2019s deputy on the committee, Conservative MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, said the traffic light system used to flag up struggling government contracts was \u201ctoo slow and clunky\u201d. \u201cProfit warnings for Carillion were issued in July and September 2017 and yet a high-risk recommendation to ministers was not made until 29 November 2017,\u201d he said. \u201cThe City, in contrast, knew well before July 2017 that Carillion was in trouble. \u201cToo many government facilities contracts were concentrated in one large firm giving the impression that it was too big to fail, hence the perception that the government would bail them out when push came to shove.\u201d A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \u201cOur priority has been the continued, safe running of public services and to minimise the impact of Carillion\u2019s insolvency. The plans we put in place have ensured this. \u201cWe engaged closely with Carillion\u2019s board members for a number of years and this remained the case after the profits warning in July 2017. But it is not right for taxpayers to bail out a private sector company.\u201d As the PAC issued its report, two other parliamentary committees investigating Carillion called on Andrew Tyrie, incoming head of the Competition and Markets Authority, to display his credentials as a \u201cnew broom\u201d by considering a break up of the so-called \u201cbig four\u201d auditors \u2013 KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY. The work and pensions and business committees have previously criticised the role of auditors in Carillion\u2019s demise in a separate report released last week. The committees also wrote to the Financial Reporting Council and the Pensions Regulator asking for an update on their efforts to strengthen their culture and review their leadership in the light of the Carillion collapse.",

The trade minister, Steve Ciobo, has said Australia would aim for a \u201chigh-quality, comprehensive free trade deal with the European Union in as quick a time as possible\u201d but would not \u201csacrifice the quality of a trade deal for speed\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon At a press conference in Canberra on Wednesday Malcolm Turnbull announced that the EU had agreed to a mandate to negotiate a free trade agreement with Australia. The prime minister said free trade was \u201ckey to my government\u2019s plan\u201d for economic growth and the EU deal would \u201ccreate more jobs in Australia and it will create more jobs in Europe\u201d. \u201cIt is not a zero-sum game.\u201d Asked about European resistance to reducing agricultural barriers, including the French president Emanuel Macron\u2019s assurances that French farmers would not be affected, Turnbull said Australia imported more agricultural products from Europe than it exported. That fact \u201ctells you a lot about how relatively little access Australian farmers have to Europe\u201d, he said. \u201cThere is a huge amount of scope for more access to the European market.\u201d Turnbull praised Macron, saying that he and Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, had pushed to allow EU negotiations with Australia to get under way. Ciobo said Australia wanted to conclude the EU deal \u201cas quick as we practicably can\u201d but added: \u201cI\u2019ve always said I won\u2019t sacrifice the quality of a trade deal for speed.\u201d \u201cA good-quality trade deal with Europe will include enhanced agricultural access for Australian exporters.\u201d Ciobo said Australia exported $3.6bn of agricultural products to the EU and impored $4.9bn and that \u201chad to change\u201d. But he said agriculture was only \u201cone aspect\u201d of a trade deal. In a statement Turnbull said the Coalition would also seek \u201cbetter access for Australian services exporters; [to] expand two-way investment flows; and deliver a more seamless business environment\u201d. \u201cWe will explore rules and initiatives to support the digital economy and innovation, which are important for small and medium-sized enterprises.\u201d The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has vowed to complete the EU\u2019s talks with Australia and New Zealand by 31 October 2019, when his time in office expires. The UK will not be able to start its negotiations over future trade with New Zealand and Australia until 30 March 2019. Earlier, speaking to ABC\u2019s AM, Ciobo insisted the talks would happen \u201cin parallel\u201d with free trade negotiations with the UK. \u201cThat\u2019s progressing, these things are happening in parallel. It\u2019s not a case of it being black or white, it\u2019s a case of doing both of these together.\u201d Turnbull trumpeted his government\u2019s achievements on free trade, including a new deal with Peru and reviving the Trans-Pacific Partnership with 11 nations, despite the withdrawal of the US. He said Australia was also in \u201cadvanced negotiations with Indonesia\u201d. Given the combined GDP of US$1.7tn of the EU, a deal with the regional bloc would potentially be Australia\u2019s largest free trade agreement.",
