      "bodyText": "The latest inflation figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics yesterday show that despite a sharp increase in petrol prices at the end of last year, overall price growth remains subdued. But while underlying inflation is at record lows there is little sense that the Reserve Bank will cut rates further. With a rise in 2016 of a mere 1.5%, the consumer price index growth last year was the lowest in a calendar year since 1998: The RBA\u2019s underlying inflation measures of the \u201ctrimmed mean\u201d and the \u201cweighted median\u201d also came in at rock bottom levels. The trimmed mean annual growth of 1.6% is the lowest ever recorded: The figures were lower than expected and as the value of the dollar rises and falls with expectations of rate rises or cuts, the value of the dollar fell half a cent in value from US$0.759 to US$0.754. That the drop was quite small given the extraordinary low figures tells you what bizarre times we live in. The inflation growth remains well below the RBA\u2019s inflation target range of 2%-3%. The underlying inflation rate of 1.6% also came in right near the bottom of the RBA\u2019s projection for 2016 of 1.5%-2.5%. And yet there is next to no expectation of a rate cut. The inflation target range has pretty clearly become a target ceiling. Underlying inflation has been below the target range for over a year now. In that time the RBA has cut rates twice, but now would seem to have decided there is little left for it to be able to do to stimulate demand. As it is, the market fully expects the next rate move to be an increase \u2013 although not till either later this year, or more likely next year. A big driver of inflation in the December quarter was tobacco. And as the ABS has now shifted tobacco from being counted as a \u201ctradable\u201d good \u2013 ie one whose price is largely determined on the world market \u2013 to a non-tradable one, there was a solid 0.8% increase in non-tradable prices in that quarter \u2013 offset somewhat by a 0.1% fall in the price of tradable products. But even with a bit of a jump in prices in the last quarter of the year, the prices of non-tradable products is growing at extremely low rates: Such a level certainly would stop the RBA from thinking about raising rates, but given the rate of non-tradables has increased to 2.1% from the low of 1.6% in the middle of last year, there is also enough in these figures to have the RBA thinking there was no need for a cut either. The impact of tobacco prices in driving inflation highlights yet again that if you want to avoid cost of living rises, avoiding smokes is a very good way to do it. While overall inflation rose 1.5% in 2016, excluding alcohol and tobacco saw inflation rise by a tiny 1.1% The issue isn\u2019t so much alcohol, but tobacco, which due to regular excise increases has far outstripped inflation over the past five years: The rise in inflation was not uniform across the nation, and the figures reflect the greater strength in the economies of NSW and Victoria compared to the current situation in Western Australia. While prices in Sydney grew by (a still very low) 1.8% in 2016, in Perth they grew by just 0.4% \u2013 the lowest annual growth experienced in either Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide or Perth since 1998: The impact of the end of the mining boom can be clearly seen in the change in prices of the rents in Perth compared to Sydney. Sydney\u2019s rents grew on average by just 2.5% last year \u2013 the fastest in the nation, but still well below the 6.2% growth experience in 2011 or the 8.1% growth of 2008. In Perth however, the average price for rent fell 7.2% in the past year \u2013 the lowest annual growth ever recorded for rents in any state capital: Less explainable by the state of the economy is the change in the price of petrol. Over the past year, petrol prices grew fastest in Melbourne, while Sydney experienced the second biggest fall, with only Hobart having a bigger price fall in 2016: The drop in petrol prices however looks mostly a thing of the past. Prices in the December quarter rose sharply across the nation, reflecting the increase in oil prices at the time: The data would suggest that while the drop in oil prices in 2015-16 did see a fall in petrol prices, the fall was not a great as could be expected. But likewise the increase in what we pay for petrol has not thus far fully reflected the 73% increase in the price of oil since January last year. The December figures of course don\u2019t count the more recent price increase \u2013 such as the 20 cents per litre rise in price in Canberra since Christmas \u2013 so it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see petrol prices again rise in the March quarter. And so overall we look set to remain in the low inflation period for a while longer yet. It is now six and half years since underlying inflation growth was above the RBA target range of 3%. So long has inflation growth been low that now not even record low growth is enough to stir interest in a rate cut. And given the government\u2019s ongoing desire to cut the deficit and keep its AAA credit rating, it would also appear that neither is such meagre inflation growth doing anything to cause the government to believe it needs to step in to spur demand in the economy.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is preparing to take a multi-billion-pound hit related to a toxic bond misselling scandal that dates back to the 2008 crisis. The bank, 73% owned by the British taxpayer, is reported to be mulling whether to set aside funds in anticipation of a settlement with the US Department of Justice over the way it packaged up and sold mortgages almost a decade ago. Chief executive Ross McEwan has repeatedly warned about the financial impact of the DoJ investigation on the bailed-out bank, which is already on course to report its ninth consecutive year of annual losses when it reports its figures for 2016 next month. Since taking over in 2013, McEwan has been attempting to tackle the issues that date back to the crisis. Speculation that RBS will take a provision for the DoJ settlement over residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) misselling has arisen because of the spate of settlements agreed with other major European banks in late December. RBS would not comment on Wednesday. But analysts have been raising the possibility of RBS being able to quantify the settlement since 23 December when Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse agreed a combined $12.5bn (\u00a39.8bn) deal with the DoJ. At the time, Barclays took the unprecedented decision to refuse to settle with the authorities. The scale of any provision that RBS might decide to take was not clear on Wednesday, but in the past the possibility of a bill of more than $12bn has been raised by UK Financial Investments, the body which looks after the taxpayer stake in the bailed-out bank. James Leigh-Pemberton, who runs UKFI, told MPs in November that the DoJ settlement \u201cmight be $5bn, it might be $12bn\u201d based on the estimates at the time by City analysts. Speculation that RBS might be considering taking a provision has been raised when analysts began to publish their forecasts for the bank\u2019s 2016 financial year. Last week Bloomberg quoted research by analysts at Goldman Sachs as saying: \u201cIn light of recent US DoJ settlements with other banks, we see the possibility that RBS will book a significant provision as early as the fourth quarter.\u201d Five other analysts surveyed by Bloomberg produced an average of $3.8bn. Even when the bank takes a provision, it may not be the final amount that the DoJ will extract from RBS for the misselling scandal, which is related to the complex packaging of home loans that was a lucrative business for the banking industry until the 2008 crisis. The uncertainty about the size of the bill has been among the reasons cited by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, for abandoning any hopes of selling off any more shares in the bank. So far, only a 5% stake has been sold off \u2013 at a \u00a31bn loss to the taxpayer. RBS has repeatedly reminded the City that the DoJ punishment will knock its finances. In September, the bank said:\u201cRMBS litigation and investigations may require additional provisions in future periods that in aggregate could be materially in excess of the [current] provisions.\u201d The bank has set aside \u00a33.8bn to cover other aspects of RMBS and billions more for other misdemeanours. The RMBS investigations are wide-ranging across a number of authorities and in September, RBS paid $1.1bn to National Credit Union Administration to resolve the long-running matter. Taxpayers paid \u00a345.5bn for shares in RBS in 2008 and 2009 to stop the Edinburgh-based bank collapsing during the financial crisis. It has not made an annual report since 2007 and since then has incurred losses of more than \u00a350bn. Its shares closed on Wednesday at 226p \u2013 below 502p, the average price at which the Treasury bought the shares during the crisis.",

      "bodyText": "British Steel will reinstate the salary it was paying workers before they accepted a pay cut last year, after predicting a return to full-year profits months after it appeared on the verge of collapse. The Scunthorpe company, one of the two remaining steelworks in the UK, was sold to investment group Greybull Capital by Tata Steel last June, as the Indian-owned company shrunk its British operations in the face of heavy losses. But British Steel said the plant had returned to profit in the first nine months of its financial year, in an update that will raise hope that new life can be breathed into steelmaking in the UK. British Steel put the improvement down to cost cuts and \u201csignificant\u201d contracts, including a \u00a32m agreement to supply the steel for the new Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in Somerset. The Scunthorpe plant is believed to have lost \u00a380m in the final year of Tata\u2019s ownership, but is on course to make enough to cover \u00a339m of investment and turn a profit. Greybull is understood to believe it can reach an underlying profit of more than \u00a3100m by its third year of ownership. British Steel\u2019s revived fortunes have resulted in it pledging to reverse a 3% salary cut agreed with 4,400 employees to help save the steelworks. Restoring workers\u2019 salaries will cost the company about \u00a39m and is due to take effect in June. Paul McBean, the British Steel multi-union chairman, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve shown we\u2019re fighters, we\u2019ve shown we\u2019re survivors and now we\u2019ve got to show that we can become industry and national champions.\u201d British Steel\u2019s executive chairman, Roland Junck, said: \u201cI\u2019m pleased to report that after our first seven months of trading, we are building on our promising start to life as British Steel.\u201d Junck previously said the business became profitable again 100 days after Greybull bought Tata\u2019s long products division for \u00a31 and revived the dormant British Steel brand, vowing to invest \u00a3400m. In an update on Wednesday, he said the business was trading in the black and could grow thanks to the Hinkley supply deal and contracts to make rails for the Algerian and Italian train networks. \u201cHaving implemented the first stage of our turnaround plan, returning the business to profit and putting it on a sustainable footing, we are now well positioned to implement the next stage of the plan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re already making good progress with significant contract awards from both new and existing customers.\u201d Greybull bought the company after the UK steel industry had been under pressure for several years due to factors including a flood of cheap Chinese products on to the market, which sent prices tumbling. The crisis threatened the future of several major steelworks, including Tata-owned Port Talbot, whose staff are shortly due to vote on a cost-cutting plan that would see their final salary pension scheme closed. But Junck said British Steel could still carve out a bright future, despite continuing pressure on the industry. \u201cDomestically we are in a unique position to provide large quantities of steel for developments through the UK, whether that be major infrastructure projects such as HS2 and Heathrow [expansion], or smaller projects such as the building of new schools or hospitals,\u201d he said. He said the company was enjoying support from the governments of the UK and France, where it also has a comparatively small business. Junck previously claimed that Tata Steel had \u201clost interest\u201d in the Scunthorpe steelworks before it was sold to Greybull. The investment group celebrated the takeover by restoring the name British Steel, which disappeared in 1999 when its predecessor merged with a Dutch rival to become Corus. Corus was later bought by Tata Steel before the company, part of Indian conglomerate Tata, began looking for a way out of the UK steel industry.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England governor has warned that a new breed of internet-only lenders are beginning to pose risks to the financial system and without tighter regulation they could trigger the next financial crash. Mark Carney said high street banks were being displaced by online lenders that were untested in a recession, when bankruptcies might make their loans worthless. Cyber-attacks could also strip customers of digital money, leaving them to face huge losses without the traditional protection offered by regulators, he said. The warning follows a speech last year by Adair Turner, the former chief financial regulator, who said losses on loans made over the internet could make the worst bankers look like \u201clending geniuses\u201d. Speaking at a conference in Germany, Carney said digital money held out the prospect of allowing millions of people excluded from the mainstream banking system to access loans securely. Threadneedle Street has several initiatives under way to allow peer-to-peer online lenders access to central bank funds and facilitate transactions. But he expected the authorities \u201cto pursue a more intense focus\u201d on financial regulations, lending rules \u201cand a more disciplined management of operational and cyber risks\u201d as the price of the industry\u2019s growing influence. In the UK, about 14% of new lending last year to small and medium-sized businesses was by so-called fintech lenders, which typically offer loans with funds provided directly by investors. He likened the growth in recent months to the explosion in securitised loans used by banks such as Northern Rock before the 2008 financial crash. \u201cIt is not clear the extent to which P2P lending can grow without business models evolving in ways that introduce conventional risks. Were these changes to occur, regulators would be expected to address such emerging vulnerabilities,\u201d he said. The UK is expected to become a global leader in online lending, putting pressure on the Bank to adopt regulations that protect customers without stifling a still young industry. Bitcoin is the best known digital currency, but swings in its value have undermined consumer confidence and limited its growth. The currency has a fixed number of coins which can be used to buy goods and services from providers that accept them. A recovery in Bitcoin\u2019s value in recent months and the popularity of the blockchain electronic wallet, which mimics a bank account, has prompted some analysts to predict it will take off this year. \u201cPayment services traditionally relied on cash, debit and credit cards, and wire transfers. Now fintech companies are providing domestic and cross-border payment services on significant scale through digital wallets or pre-funded eMoney,\u201d Carney said. \u201cTech firms take a slice of payment revenues and, in many cases, the totality of customer transaction data. In the process, they are systematically capturing the type of knowledge I used to gain from my daily interactions with customers in the bank branch,\u201d he said, referring to his first job as a bank teller.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The global market surge which has led to the Dow Jones Industrial Average finally breaking through the 20,000 has also seen other markets move higher. The records set by the Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq Composite, boosted by the Trump rally and reasonable updates from US stalwarts such as Boeing, have helped lift European markets. Good results from Logitech and Banco Santander were also a factor in the confident mood on the continent. But with the dollar weakening and pushing the pound to six week highs - sterling is now up 0.8% at $1.2620 - the FTSE 100 has missed out on much of the gains. The leading UK index is packed with overseas earners who have benefited from a weak pound but tend to lose ground when sterling strengthens. So the final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 edged up 0.2% or 14.09 points to 7164.43 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 1.82% to 11,806.05 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.99% to 4877.67 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 0.42% higher at 19,582.23 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.73% at 9549.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.96% to 659.19 On Wall Street the Dow is now up 144 points or 0.7% at 20,056. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. There is much talk about whether the current stock market levels mean we are in a new bubble phase (leading fund manager Neil Woodford recently compared the euphoria of recent months to the dotcom boom and bust). But Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Stock indices in the US and UK may well be at or near record highs, however when the earnings generated by companies in these markets are factored in, stock valuations show neither the extreme pessimism of 2008, nor the irrational exuberance of 1999. This means they are trading somewhere in the middle of their range, so are neither exceptionally cheap or hideously expensive. In the short term the stock market could move in either direction, but for long term investors it still makes sense to keep a healthy slug of their portfolio in equities. Meanwhile bonds have come under pressure of late, as it looks like the US central bank is in the mood to raise interest rates this year. However there have been many false dusks for the bond market, which has defied expectations since ultra-loose monetary policy was initiated all those years ago in response to the financial crisis. Central banks in the UK, Europe and Japan are still engaged in stimulative activity, and while the US Fed is starting to push in the opposite direction, it\u2019s likely to err on the side of caution lest by raising rates too soon it damages the US economy, and propels an already strong dollar even further upwards. While the best days for the bond market may be behind us, there\u2018s no sign that interest rates are going to return to pre-crisis levels any time soon, which acts as an anchor on rising yields. And here\u2019s the response to the Dow crossing 20,000 from the man most analysts say helped the recent surge in stock markets. Via Twitter of course: Away from the Dow for a moment, and early elections in Italy could be on the cards after a call ruling. Reuters writes: Italy\u2019s constitutional court said on Wednesday that part of a contested electoral law was invalid, but left much of the system intact in a ruling that could open the way for early elections in 2017. In a written verdict, the court rejected the idea that national elections could be held over two rounds, but agreed that any party which took at least 40 percent of the vote straight out should win an automatic parliamentary majority. The court said the amended law could now be used immediately if elections were called. A vote is not scheduled until early 2018 but former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who still heads the ruling Democratic Party, has said he wants a ballot held as soon as possible. The news has taken some of the shine off the Italian stock market, with the FTSE MIB losing much of its earlier gains. It is now up 0.43% at 19579 having at one point reached 19746. It is not just the Dow in uncharted territory. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both ended at new highs on Tuesday, and in morning trading they have added to their gains. The S&amp;P is currently 0.6% higher, while Nasdaq is 0.74% better. And some seem confident the US rally will continue. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: For all the supposed uncertainty surrounding the new President, it only took two full days in office for the Dow to breach 20,000. It comes a day after the S&amp;P 500 hit a new record high. Dow 20k came on the same day President Trump was preparing to sign an executive order to build a wall on the US-Mexican border. The big industrial giants including Caterpillar and General Electric led the gains on the expectation of an increase in infrastructure spending under Trump. A lot of diggers will be needed to build the wall! In reality, Trump can start the building, but will need help from Congress to get it finished. Building a Wall on the US-Mexican border was Donald Trump\u2019s most famous and probably most controversial campaign promise. He will also sign an executive order designed to limit immigration. Actually following through with his \u201cGreat Wall\u201d is a sign of intent. It is our view that the gains in the stock market are not just a function of companies winning infrastructure business. Investors are gaining certainty from Trump turning his promises to reality. There are a number of psychological factors at work when the stock market crosses these big barriers that we will be watching. Widespread reporting of Dow 20k will create a FOMO (fear of missing out) effect on the under-invested, generating more buying interest. On the other hand, the 20,000 level will attract profit-taking from some long-time stock market bulls, causing a counteracting selling force. We remain confident in the durability of the US stock market rally. If Donald Trump will build a wall, there\u2019s every reason to believe he will cut taxes, increase spending and cut regulation- all good things for US companies. There was some relief among analysts that the Dow had finally made it. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: In all honesty it couldn\u2019t have come a moment too soon, finally putting us out of our misery so we can start to focus on something else more important. On a serious note, while it\u2019s important to acknowledge the breaking of a significant milestone, in the broader scheme of things it probably doesn\u2019t matter that much, apart from giving investors a feel good boost. Of more importance is whether or not it is able to sustain these gains at a time when US stocks are already considered expensive. It looked for a while as if the Trump rally which followed the election of the US president was about to run out of steam, as the Dow tried and failed a couple of times to breach the 20,000 barrier. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The Trump rally seemed to have disappeared as Christmas turned into the New Year. However, with the thin-skinned President now in power and talking about stripping back regulations and building his infamous wall, investors have begun to get excited all over again. Following yesterday\u2019s late rally the Dow Jones rose by 130 points as the bell rang on Wall Street, in the process breaking that 20,000 psychological barrier. These good vibes travelled over to Europe, where the DAX and CAC rocketed 2% and 1.2% respectively. That leaves the German index at its highest point since May 2015, and only 600 points from its own all-time record. It wasn\u2019t all explosive growth for the Western markets this Wednesday. The FTSE could only manage a paltry 0.3% rise, laughable in the face of what was produced elsewhere, thanks to the pound\u2019s continued recovery. With Theresa May announcing that the government would produce a Brexit whitepaper sterling\u2019s early growth was firmed up, the currency benefiting from the increasing clarity on the how Britain intends to divorce the EU. Against the dollar it jumped by 0.7%, hitting its best level since mid-December, while against the euro it crossed 1.17 for the first time since January 6th. It will be interesting to see if the pound can continue to build on these gains tomorrow, especially if a bill on Article 50 is actually produced. Here\u2019s CNBC covering the moment the Dow passed 20,000, pointing out that unlike the last time it attempted to cross this level, this move comes after a number of businesses including Boeing have reported well received updates. And here are the big movers so far in the Dow: Boeing is up after its results, while the likes of Caterpillar are expected to benefit from Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall on the Mexican border. The Dow has breached the 20,000 barrier just two months after crossing through 19,000, as the rally following Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president hit its stride. The new Wall Street record comes after a few attempts at the 20,000 barrier. Dominic Rushe writes: The Dow Jones industrial average finally broke through the 20,000 barrier on Wednesday morning \u2013 a historic high for the leading stock market index and one it has been close to breaching since Christmas. The Dow, which first nearly topped 20,000 on 13 December and again on 6 January, when it came within 0.37 points of the landmark, finally broke through after the opening bell was rung on Wall Street by Ashton Poole, CEO of lender Triangle Capital. The closing bell will be rung by executives from InBev, brewers of Stella Artois but whether the Dow\u2019s rise will go flat by then remains to be seen. The market had rallied sharply in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory but seemed to loose steam ahead of his first day in office. It broke the barrier of Wednesday after infrastructure stocks rose sharply ahead of the market\u2019s open, boosted by Trump\u2019s renewed pledge to build a wall along the Mexican border and talks of massive infrastructure investment. The Dow record comes as the S&amp;P 500 index, tech-heavy Nasdaq and London\u2019s FTSE 100 stock market index have all hit record highs. So is this a bubble or something sustainable? Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said The Dow has capped a remarkable rally since Donald Trump\u2019s election by finally breaking the 20,000 level. It\u2019s psychologically huge and, after a bit of pullback ahead of the inauguration, really confirms that the \u2018great rotation\u2019 from bonds to stocks is definitely upon us. Fears about protectionism are running second to optimism about inflation and growth \u2013 for now at least. Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, far from roiling markets, has been greeted with universal optimism about what it means for global growth. Something like $3trillion has been pulled from bonds and $3trillion pumped into equities. President Trump is bound to take credit for the rally, and he may well be justified to some degree... The question now is how long can this last? Economists are usually unwise to make predictions, so it\u2019s worth considering both potential outcomes. One argument says that Trump will usher in a Reaganesque shift in the US economy, fuelling a massive reallocation of investment from cash to productive capital... Trump\u2019s first steps as president have confirmed much of what investors had hoped for and that he\u2019s extremely pro-business and light on regulation for energy and financials. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving this renewed rally. The other argument claims that this is a massive bubble, irrational exuberance of the worst kind that will come unstuck when Trump fails to deliver the reflationary policies that the market is pinning its hopes on... However, bull markets normally only turn into bear markets on an expected downturn in the real economy. There is little evidence that the US is heading for recession \u2013 quite the reverse as Trump is ushering a new era of pro-business policies that affirm growth prospects. We are seeing a massive shift in investor sentiment that has seen money pour out of bonds and into equities around the world. This is a major recalibration in global stocks and bond markets \u2013 ie, not a bubble in the pure sense, although it might be rising faster than is natural. [If] this is a real rotation from bonds into stocks, ending a 30-year bond bull market, there is still a huge amount of cash piled up that could yet pour into equities and power further gains through 2017. It might not be too long before 21,000 is in sight. And it\u2019s there! The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 116 points and has crossed through 20,000 for the first time. Just a couple of minutes now until Wall Street opens and the futures are suggesting the Dow Jones Industrial Average could indeed make 20,000 for the first time. The Trump rally and some positive trading updates from the likes of Boeing and hard drive maker Seagate look set to help push markets higher. Elsewhere, shares in BT are struggling to make any ground after Tuesday\u2019s 21% slump in the wake of an accounting scandal at its Italian business and a weak outlook for a couple of its other divisions. They have edged up 0.7% to 305.1p, but this is not exactly a big dent in Tuesday\u2019s \u00a38bn loss. Meanwhile Italian prosecutors have confirmed they are investigating BT Italy. Milan prosecutor Fabio De Pasquale told FastFT that the probe was focused on allegations of \u201cfalse accounting and embezzlement\u201d, as reported on Tuesday. And to add to BT\u2019s woes, the situation is also being looked at by the Financial Reporting Council, which said: \u201dWe are aware of BT\u2019s statement about its review of accounting issues in its Italian business and we will consider if these matters require the FRC to investigate whether the auditors fulfilled their duties.\u201d Elsewhere, the head of BT Europe Corrado Sciolla was said on Tuesday to be resigning over the scandal, and now Reuters is reporting that Luis Alvarez, the head of BT Global Service, is expected to take over the running of the European division. IG reckon that Wall Street traders can get the Dow 20k hats out. New York trading begins in 90 minutes time.... After weeks of near-misses, could the Dow Jones finally hit the 20,000 point mark today? The global stock market rally today is raising speculation that the Dow could hit this benchmark for the first time; it closed at 19,912 on Tuesday night. With every European stock market up today, the futures market suggests Wall Street will follow suit, helped by optimism that Donald Trump\u2019s plans for infrastructure spending will boost corporate profits. 20,000 is just a number, of course - but some traders would be happy to get the issue out of the way. If it does happen, expect @realDonaldTrump to take the credit.... The US dollar has dipped to a seven-week low against a basket of other major currencies (including the pound) this morning. Chris Saint, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Currency Services, says there is \u201cbroad-based selling pressure on the dollar\u201d. Bloomberg has more details: Boom! The pound just hit $1.26 for the first time since December 14. Newsflash from parliament: Theresa May has just revealed that the government will publish a white paper outlining its Brexit plan. That may please the City, as it will more insight into the government\u2019s ambitions for the EU exit negotiations. Andrew Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has all the details: France\u2019s credit rating could come under threat if populist far-right Marine Le Pen reached the final stage of the country\u2019s presidential race, an official from Moody\u2019s has said. Reuters has the story: Asked whether Le Pen progressing to the second round would prompt Moody\u2019s to move the outlook on France\u2019s Aa2 credit rating to negative, Dietmar Hornung said, \u201cThat is the obvious thing.\u201d He gave the example of how Moody\u2019s waited until after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union to put the UK\u2019s rating on a negative outlook, however. The negative impact of the rating \u201cwouldn\u2019t persist if then in the second round Fillon or Macron or whoever wins,\u201d he told Reuters. Le Pen is currently second favourite to win the presidential race, behind right-winger Francois Fillon. The latest Guardian Brexit dashboard is out! Our monthly healthcheck on the UK economy shows that the fall in the pound following the EU referendum is hurting the economy, pushing inflation higher. The latest retail sales, house prices and trade figures were all disappointing too, although the economy does seem to still be growing steadily (we get new GDP figures tomorrow). My colleague Katie Allen, who compiles the report explains: Seven months on from the referendum, the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news shows the weaker pound is being felt in the real economy more keenly than ever, as it raises the cost of imports such as energy and food and that gets passed on to consumers as higher prices in the shops. To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE. The dashboard for January shows a worse than expected performance in four of the eight categories. Two were better than expected and unemployment was as expected. Inflation was higher than economists had forecast, hitting its highest level for more than two years in December. Here\u2019s the full story: Here\u2019s the key charts: And here\u2019s Danny Blanchflower and Andrew Sentance, both former Bank of England policymakers, on the numbers. Just in: UK manufacturers are their most upbeat since January 2015, according to the latest Industrial Trends survey from the CBI. Factories also reported that domestic orders have grown strongly over the last quarter, but export growth has dipped back. The survey shows that the pound\u2019s tumble is pushing up import prices, but it\u2019s also making UK firms more competitive in the global market. And a quarter of companies reported that they are worried they can\u2019t hire skilled staff - that\u2019s the highest level since July 1989. Here\u2019s the report. Optimism over Donald Trump\u2019s spending plans are expected to push shares higher on Wall Street later today. The futures markets shows the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq rising by 0.3%, having hit record highs on Tuesday. Relief that the supreme court\u2019s Brexit ruling is out of the way is pushing the pound towards $1.26, says Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG. Despite yesterday\u2019s court decision, markets continue to enjoy a degree of clarity over the UK\u2019s path that has not been seen since June\u2019s referendum result. With Citibank and Credit Suisse the latest banks to voice their plans to move jobs out of London, it is clear that Theresa May needs to have a robust and dramatic jobs strategy if we are going to see the UK maintain growth over the coming years. The UK pound is having a good morning, rising 0.5% to hit a six-week high of $1.2598 against the dollar. This recovers yesterday\u2019s losses, which came after the supreme court\u2019s Brexit ruling. Traders are now watching to see what legislation the government brings to trigger the exit process from the EU. Rebellious Conservative MPs are now pushing for a full debate on the Brexit plan, and are concerned about Britain\u2019s likely exit from the single market and the customs union. So the pound is likely to remain volatile. Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services says the length of this Act will be critical: For all the furore (aka political windbagging) around yesterday\u2019s UK Constitutional Court ruling, the only real question is how \u201ctight\u201d the wording of the Act of Parliament (to trigger Article 50) will be. The trick to stopping opponents tagging on conditions would be to make the Act very short, say as little as one paragraph, which would then make it very difficult to change as the rules state that \u201camendments must be ruled to be within the scope of the original text\u201d. It should be emphasized that \u2018no one won anything\u2019 with the ruling, it is a simple principle that Parliament has to be consulted, if a proposed statute implies a change to the UK\u2019s basic law - Article 50 clearly fits that principle 100%. The pound is also up 0.4% against the euro at \u20ac1.171, meaning one euro is worth 85.3p. That will be welcomed by UK holidaymakers, and eurozone firms who export goods into the UK, points out Dublin-based broker Paul Sommerville. Here\u2019s Neil Wilson of ETX Capital on today\u2019s market moves: There\u2019s something of the Trump bump about all this. For instance, rising copper prices are a sign that global growth is turning positive off the back of his expected reflationary policies. But another leading indicator, the Baltic Dry Index, has slumped of late, a signal that fears of protectionist policies are very high. It\u2019s a mixed picture for miners and uncertain for sure. BHP Billiton was up nearly 2% as it looks set to benefit from rising metal prices. Fresnillo edged lower despite reporting record annual silver and gold production, as prices for the two metals slipped. Shares in UK eateries group Restaurant Group have slumped by 10% this morning, after another disappointing trading update. The company, which runs Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s. Garfunkel\u2019s, Brunning &amp; Price, Chiquito and other chains, posted a 3.9% drop in like-for-like sales. It also predicted a \u2018difficult\u2019 trading performance over the next six months, as it tries to shake up its offerings to tempt customers Restaurant Group also admitted that the slump in the pound will drive up input costs, and said the apprenticeship levy, proposed increases in business rates and higher energy taxes will bring extra cost pressures. Oof!! Confidence among German executives has weakened to a five-month low. The IFO survey of German business confidence has missed forecasts, falling to 109.8 this month from 111 in December. Economists expected a small rise to 111.3 Clemens Fuest, head of the IFO economic institute, says German firms are happy with the current situation, but less optimistic about the outlook over the next six months. At times like this, we all need a laugh. And strong sales of spoof humour books and growing customer numbers at airport shops gave WH Smith reason for cheer in its latest trading update. A comic revival of Enid Blyton\u2019s Famous Five characters helped to lift like-for-like sales 1% at the retailer over the 21 weeks to 21 January, with Five on Brexit Island and Five Give up the Booze among the best-sellers. Sales at its network of shops in travel locations such as motorway service stations and airports were up 5%, but down 3% at its shops on UK high streets. The retailer, which this year celebrates its 225th birthday, said that strong sales of spoof humour books and seasonal stationery were offset by year-on-year sales figures for adult colouring books that were tough to beat, having sold really well over the same period last year. Chief executive Stephen Clarke sounded a broadly positive note: \u201cAs a result of the performance in travel we expect group profit growth for the year to be slightly ahead of plan. \u201cWhile there is some uncertainty in the broader economic environment, we remain confident that the group is well positioned for the year ahead as we continue to focus on profitable growth, cash generation and investing in new opportunities.\u201d And the verdict from veteran retail analyst Nick Bubb? \u201cAlthough the comparisons were tough, the business has come through well. How far the 225th Anniversary celebrations of the company help trade this year remains to be seen, but the City will be relieved by the strong Christmas trading performance.\u201d Shares were up 7.6% at \u00a315.93 in early trading, making the retailer the biggest riser on the FTE 250 in early trading. The Mexican Peso has weakened by 0.15% today, to 21.56 peso to the US dollar. It\u2019s suffering from president Trump\u2019s threat to erect a wall on the US-Mexico border. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: Trump tweets continue to drive sentiment and the President\u2019s most recent - \u201cBig day planned fort NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among other things, we will build the wall!\u201d - saw the Mexican peso reverse Monday/Tuesday gains. German government bond prices are falling this morning, pushing the yield (or interest rate) on bunds to a six-week high. That shows that investors are moving money out of safe-haven assets and into shares. The pound is holding firm at $1.252 this morning, as the City waits for the government to publish its bill on exiting the European Union. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has gained almost 1% this morning, putting it on track for its biggest gain of 2017. Solid earning figures from Santander, which posted a 4% increase in revenue, are helping the mood. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has gained nearly 0.7% this morning, as it gains 48 points to 7199. Mining group Antofagasta is leading the rally, up over 5%, after reporting a solid production report. Other miners are also on the up because commodity prices are bouncing ahead, on hopes of a US spending boost from Trump. Mike Van Dulken of Accendo Markets says this strength in base metals is driving the markets up. Copper in particular up on restricted supply (BHP Billiton cut guidance; prolonged strikes could make matters worse) and growth/inflation expectations from US infrastructure spending plans as Trump sticks to his campaign hymn sheet. Aluminium, Iron Ore, Lead and Zinc are all tagging along while Oil holds around $53/55, near the mid-point of a $50-60 range as US production increases challenge OPEC cuts. Traders have a lot to fret about right now, from Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist threats to Britain\u2019s push towards Brexit. But today, shares are rising on optimism that the global economy may strengthen this year, as Trump starts to delivers on fiscal stimulus boost he promised during his campaign. Last night, America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices both hit new record highs, as Trump controversially approved two energy projects. This pushed shares up on Wall Street, as Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, told CNBC: \u201cI think the real lift in the market was the second round of executive orders from the White House. This is very much a Trump-infrastructure rally.\u201d This has fed through to Asia where most markets rallied, with Japan\u2019s Topix index up 1%. There\u2019s a positive start in Europe too, with the main markets gaining ground in early trading. Donald Trump has alarmed many observers with his early moves as president, with environmentalists aghast that he is reviving the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. But in the cold-hearted world of the markets, the \u2018Trump rally\u2019 is back on, as Kathleen Brooks of City Index puts it. US stock markets have showed renewed signs of life this week, and the Nasdaq made a fresh record high on Tuesday as the market toyed with the idea of reigniting the \u2018Trump rally\u2019 that we saw in the aftermath of the presidential election last November. Based on Tuesday\u2019s performance, it looks like the market is happy with the first flourish of Trump\u2019s executive orders. History suggests that there could be further upside for stocks.... Trump also advanced the Keystone Pipeline project on Tuesday, something that President Obama slapped down. These first steps may not please climate change activists, but, as expected, they suggest that President Trump is \u2018business friendly\u2019 and the markets are greeting this with approval. Thus, stocks are in a strong position as we move to the middle of the week. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up today. 9am GMT: German IFO confidence report for January, showing how optimistic business leaders in the eurozone\u2019s largest economy are this month. 11am: CBI Industrial trends survey, showing how Britain\u2019s factories are faring 3.30pm: US crude oil inventory figures 4pm: Bank of England governor Mark Carney is speaking at a banking conference in Wiesbaden, Germany.

But Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Stock indices in the US and UK may well be at or near record highs, however when the earnings generated by companies in these markets are factored in, stock valuations show neither the extreme pessimism of 2008, nor the irrational exuberance of 1999. This means they are trading somewhere in the middle of their range, so are neither exceptionally cheap or hideously expensive. In the short term the stock market could move in either direction, but for long term investors it still makes sense to keep a healthy slug of their portfolio in equities.</p> <p>Meanwhile bonds have come under pressure of late, as it looks like the US central bank is in the mood to raise interest rates this year. However there have been many false dusks for the bond market, which has defied expectations since ultra-loose monetary policy was initiated all those years ago in response to the financial crisis. Central banks in the UK, Europe and Japan are still engaged in stimulative activity, and while the US Fed is starting to push in the opposite direction, it\u2019s likely to err on the side of caution lest by raising rates too soon it damages the US economy, and propels an already strong dollar even further upwards. While the best days for the bond market may be behind us, there\u2018s no sign that interest rates are going to return to pre-crisis levels any time soon, which acts as an anchor on rising yields.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888d840e4b0cea1f09276aa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T16:55:10.715Z\">4.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s the response to the Dow crossing 20,000 from the man most analysts say helped the recent surge in stock markets.

A vote is not scheduled until early 2018 but former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who still heads the ruling Democratic Party, has said he wants a ballot held as soon as possible.</p> </blockquote> <p>The news has taken some of the shine off the Italian stock market, with the FTSE MIB losing much of its earlier gains.

Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For all the supposed uncertainty surrounding the new President, it only took two full days in office for the Dow to breach 20,000. It comes a day after the S&amp;P 500 hit a new record high.</p> <p>Dow 20k came on the same day President Trump was preparing to sign an executive order to build a wall on the US-Mexican border. The big industrial giants including Caterpillar and General Electric led the gains on the expectation of an increase in infrastructure spending under Trump. A lot of diggers will be needed to build the wall! In reality, Trump can start the building, but will need help from Congress to get it finished.</p> <p>Building a Wall on the US-Mexican border was Donald Trump\u2019s most famous and probably most controversial campaign promise. He will also sign an executive order designed to limit immigration. Actually following through with his \u201cGreat Wall\u201d is a sign of intent. It is our view that the gains in the stock market are not just a function of companies winning infrastructure business. Investors are gaining certainty from Trump turning his promises to reality.</p> <p>There are a number of psychological factors at work when the stock market crosses these big barriers that we will be watching. Widespread reporting of Dow 20k will create a FOMO (fear of missing out) effect on the under-invested, generating more buying interest. On the other hand, the 20,000 level will attract profit-taking from some long-time stock market bulls, causing a counteracting selling force.</p> <p>We remain confident in the durability of the US stock market rally. If Donald Trump will build a wall, there\u2019s every reason to believe he will cut taxes, increase spending and cut regulation- all good things for US companies.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f455e286f8c1584cb93e646184a2db02932ab0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f455e286f8c1584cb93e646184a2db02932ab0a/0_137_4096_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The New York Stock Exchange.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The New York Stock Exchange.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Gombert/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888c4d0e4b029dbeb0a6509\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T15:32:47.420Z\">3.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There was some relief among analysts that the Dow had finally made it.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Trump rally seemed to have disappeared as Christmas turned into the New Year. However, with the thin-skinned President now in power and talking about stripping back regulations and building his infamous wall, investors have begun to get excited all over again. Following yesterday\u2019s late rally the Dow Jones rose by 130 points as the bell rang on Wall Street, in the process breaking that 20,000 psychological barrier.</p> <p>These good vibes travelled over to Europe, where the DAX and CAC rocketed 2% and 1.2% respectively. That leaves the German index at its highest point since May 2015, and only 600 points from its own all-time record.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t all explosive growth for the Western markets this Wednesday. The FTSE could only manage a paltry 0.3% rise, laughable in the face of what was produced elsewhere, thanks to the pound\u2019s continued recovery. With Theresa May announcing that the government would produce a Brexit whitepaper sterling\u2019s early growth was firmed up, the currency benefiting from the increasing clarity on the how Britain intends to divorce the EU. Against the dollar it jumped by 0.7%, hitting its best level since mid-December, while against the euro it crossed 1.17 for the first time since January 6<sup>th</sup>. It will be interesting to see if the pound can continue to build on these gains tomorrow, especially if a bill on Article 50 is actually produced.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888c0cee4b0cea1f09275f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T15:17:18.980Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s CNBC covering the moment the Dow passed 20,000, pointing out that unlike the last time it attempted to cross this level, this move comes after a number of businesses including Boeing have reported well received updates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/824269343550820352\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WATCH: The moment that the Dow hit 20,000 for the first time ever <a href=\"https://t.co/0fvzncrKtP\">pic.twitter.com/0fvzncrKtP</a></p>&mdash; CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/824269343550820352\">January 25, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888bd1ce4b029dbeb0a64d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T14:59:27.717Z\">2.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here are the big movers so far in the Dow:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8163a38b820b08b7c9f9124b67606e825222bea1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8163a38b820b08b7c9f9124b67606e825222bea1/0_0_637_684/466.jpg\" alt=\"Dow movers\" width=\"466\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dow movers</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boeing is up after its results, while the likes of Caterpillar are expected to benefit from Trump\u2019s plans to build a wall on the Mexican border.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T15:46:34.880Z\">at 3.46pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5888ba23e4b0cea1f09275d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T14:53:49.677Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Dow has breached the 20,000 barrier just two months after crossing through 19,000, as the rally following Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president hit its stride.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f277db240626654a853183303a47ca30dfb87e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f277db240626654a853183303a47ca30dfb87e1/0_0_1180_759/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dow hits 20,000\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dow hits 20,000</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5888b93ee4b0cea1f09275cb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dominic-rushe\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-25T14:43:41.039Z\">2.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The new Wall Street record comes after a few attempts at the 20,000 barrier.

      "bodyText": "The biggest winners from the construction of Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful, powerful\u201d wall along the US-Mexico border are likely to be Mexican cement companies and construction workers. The US president was expected to sign executive orders on Wednesday laying the groundwork for the construction of his signature policy multibillion-dollar wall, which he has promised will keep out \u201cMexican rapists and drug dealers\u201d and will be paid for by Mexico. Trump has repeatedly said building the wall will cost $8bn to $10bn (\u00a36.3 to \u00a37.9bn), but construction experts have said it is likely to cost several multiples of the president\u2019s estimate \u2013 perhaps more than $30bn. The construction consultants Gleeds Worldwide said building a 1,000-mile wall \u2013 the border is 1,889 miles long but large parts are protected by natural barriers including mountains and the Rio Grande \u2013 would cost $31bn and take 40,000 people more than five years to construct. Richard Steer, the Gleeds chairman, said the wall would be one of the most difficult and expensive construction projects ever undertaken due to the difficulty of bringing so many heavy materials to remote regions. He said in addition to the $4bn of concrete and $6bn of steel required for the project, more than $2bn would need to be spent on clearing land and building access roads. \u201cThe idea of building a 1,000-mile wall which is designed to be impenetrable is something that may well come back to haunt the president,\u201d Steer said. He described the project as \u201ca highly effective and eye-catching election tweet but a pretty unrealistic tendering opportunity as currently reported. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to build roads to move the materials and machinery and get the workforce to the location as the wall is being built,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would need a very big labour force to build it \u2013 some 40,000 people working over five years.\u201d Steer said the workforce would probably be drawn mostly from the Mexican side of the border as semi-skilled construction wages are much lower and there are more Mexican settlements close to the border. \u201cThere would be a certain irony of getting Mexicans to build it,\u201d Steer said. \u201cIt would likely be a mixed labour force, but Mexicans would be much less expensive.\u201d The high cost of transporting the approximately 44m cubic yards of concrete and 9m tonnes of steel to the site is likely to lead builders to rely on mostly Mexican-owned cement and concrete plants. Analysts at Bernstein investment bank plotted the location of nearby plants and quarries and found that the Mexican building company Cemex was best-positioned to provide materials on both sides of the border. \u201cAs ludicrous as the Trump wall project sounds (to us at least), it represents a huge opportunity for those companies involved in its construction,\u201d a Bernstein analyst said in a research report for investors. \u201cCemex appears best positioned regardless, with cement, RMX [ready mix concrete], and aggregates facilities throughout the border region.\u201d Shares in Cemex have risen by 130% over the past year and hit an eight-and-half year high on Wednesday as investors waited to hear the details of Trump\u2019s wall-building plan. Cemex is the world\u2019s second-largest cement and building materials producer, and also owns 23% of Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua (GCC), another cement company with several facilities near the site of the proposed wall. However, it is in the process of selling this stake. On the other side of the border, the US builders Vulcan Materials and Martin Marietta Materials, which both have plants nearby, saw their shares rise by at least 10% on the day after Trump\u2019s election and have continued increasing in value since. Trump is expected to sign an executive order to direct federal funding to pay for the construction of the wall despite repeatedly declaring that Mexico would have to pay for it. The president has insisted he is not breaking his election pledge and Mexico would reimburse the US for the cost. \u201cThe dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the great wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!\u201d he tweeted last Friday. Last year Vicente Fox, the former Mexican president, said in a live interview on Fox Business Network TV: \u201cI\u2019m not going to pay for that fucking wall.\u201d Trump responded saying: \u201cThe wall just got 10 ft taller.\u201d Trump is due to meet the current Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, next week.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/824083821889015809\">January 25, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Trump has repeatedly said building the wall will cost $8bn to $10bn (\u00a36.3 to \u00a37.9bn), but construction experts have said it is likely to cost several multiples of the president\u2019s estimate \u2013 perhaps more than $30bn. </p> <p>The construction consultants Gleeds Worldwide said building a 1,000-mile wall \u2013 the border is 1,889 miles long but large parts are protected by natural barriers including mountains and the Rio Grande \u2013 would cost $31bn and take 40,000 people more than five years to construct.</p> <p>Richard Steer, the Gleeds chairman, said the wall would be one of the most difficult and expensive construction projects ever undertaken due to the difficulty of bringing so many heavy materials to remote regions. </p> <p>He said in addition to the $4bn of concrete and $6bn of steel required for the project, more than $2bn would need to be spent on clearing land and building access roads. </p> <p>\u201cThe idea of building a 1,000-mile wall which is designed to be impenetrable is something that may well come back to haunt the president,\u201d Steer said. </p> <p>He described the project as \u201ca highly effective and eye-catching election tweet but a pretty unrealistic tendering opportunity as currently reported.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to build roads to move the materials and machinery and get the workforce to the location as the wall is being built,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would need a very big labour force to build it \u2013 some 40,000 people working over five years.\u201d</p> <p>Steer said the workforce would probably be drawn mostly from the Mexican side of the border as semi-skilled construction wages are much lower and there are more Mexican settlements close to the border. </p> <p>\u201cThere would be a certain irony of getting Mexicans to build it,\u201d Steer said. \u201cIt would likely be a mixed labour force, but Mexicans would be much less expensive.\u201d </p> <p>The high cost of transporting the approximately 44m cubic yards of concrete and 9m tonnes of steel to the site is likely to lead builders to rely on mostly Mexican-owned cement and concrete plants. </p> <p>Analysts at Bernstein investment bank plotted the location of nearby plants and quarries and found that the Mexican building company Cemex was best-positioned to provide materials on both sides of the border. </p> <p>\u201cAs ludicrous as the Trump wall project sounds (to us at least), it represents a huge opportunity for those companies involved in its construction,\u201d a Bernstein analyst said in a research report for investors. \u201cCemex appears best positioned regardless, with cement, RMX [ready mix concrete], and aggregates facilities throughout the border region.\u201d</p> <p>Shares in Cemex have risen by 130% over the past year and hit an eight-and-half year high on Wednesday as investors waited to hear the details of Trump\u2019s wall-building plan. </p> <p>Cemex is the world\u2019s second-largest cement and building materials producer, and also owns 23% of Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua (GCC), another cement company with several facilities near the site of the proposed wall. However, it is in the process of selling this stake.</p> <p>On the other side of the border, the US builders Vulcan Materials and Martin Marietta Materials, which both have plants nearby, saw their shares rise by at least 10% on the day after Trump\u2019s election and have continued increasing in value since.</p> <p>Trump is expected to sign an executive order to direct federal funding to pay for the construction of the wall despite repeatedly declaring that Mexico would have to pay for it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a02f5ebd6d4315019086f4c47d78a4bbb3ee79e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a02f5ebd6d4315019086f4c47d78a4bbb3ee79e8/0_0_4776_3184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People in Mexico City protest against Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration next to a fake wall with a dummy representing him.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People in Mexico City protest against Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration next to a fake wall with a dummy representing him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The president has insisted he is not breaking his election pledge and Mexico would reimburse the US for the cost. </p> <p>\u201cThe dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the great wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!\u201d he tweeted last Friday.</p> <p>Last year Vicente Fox, the former Mexican president, said in a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm89Jjxj7QI\">live interview on Fox Business Network TV</a>: \u201cI\u2019m not going to pay for that fucking wall.\u201d Trump responded saying: \u201cThe wall just got 10 ft taller.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is due to meet the current Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, next week. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09244r.pdf\">The government accountability office has previously said</a> the cost of constructing a border fence is between $2.8m and $3.9m a mile on flat land, but up to $16m a mile on desert or mountain terrain.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Global demand for oil will still be growing in 2035 even with an enormous growth in electric cars in the next two decades, with numbers on the road rising from 1m to 100m, BP has predicted. The oil and gas giant predicted that despite electric cars spreading rapidly and renewable energy recording exceptional growth, oil demand would still rise because of rising prosperity in the developing world. BP said electric cars would not be a \u201cgamechanger\u201d for the oil industry. \u201cIt\u2019s not Teslas and the US. It\u2019s the fact that 2 billion people, much of that in Asia, are moving to middle incomes, can buy their first motor car and that drives up oil demand. It\u2019s that stuff that really matters,\u201d said Spencer Dale, BP group\u2019s chief economist. Publishing its energy outlook, which forecasts long-term trends and informs the company\u2019s internal strategy, BP predicted global energy demand would grow nearly a third by 2035. Fossil fuels would still account for 75% of the energy mix, slightly down on the 80% BP forecast last year. Oil demand was unlikely to peak until the mid-2040s, Dale said, in a prediction similar to that of the International Energy Agency but much later than some other observers think. The analysts Wood Mackenzie believe oil demand could \u201cpeak well before 2035\u201d, while BP\u2019s rival Shell has talked of a peak as soon as five years\u2019 time. BP has been attacked in the past for repeatedly underestimating the growth of wind and solar power in its annual outlook. Its latest update expects renewables to be the fastest-growing fuel source in coming years, at 7.6% annually, compared with 1.6% for gas and 0.7% for oil, with China driving the largest growth in green energy. Greenpeace accused the company of peddling a \u201cfantasy future where the world fails to act on climate change\u201d. Greg Muttitt, senior adviser at campaign group Oil Change International, said: \u201cEvery year BP has predicted a slowdown in renewable energy growth, and every year it has been wrong \u2013 but it\u2019s done so again today. And BP says electric cars are going nowhere in the next 20 years, a view not shared by the car industry.\u201d Some forecasts, such as Bloomberg New Energy Finance\u2019s, see more than 200m electric cars globally by 2035. BP\u2019s base case foresees 100m electric cars by then, or 5% of the global car fleet. That\u2019s up from 57m in the company\u2019s outlook last year because of falling battery prices, although BP admitted there was a large uncertainty over the numbers. \u201cBP\u2019s 2017 outlook has increased its electric vehicle projections on last year, but this still lags far behind the potential penetration if the technology were to take off, meaning there is still a risk of the company misreading oil demand,\u201d said James Leaton, head of research at the Carbon Tracker Initiative, a London-based thinktank. BP said the election of Donald Trump as US president and his domestic \u201cAmerica First\u201d pro-fossil-fuel energy plan, published last week, was unlikely to have a big impact on efforts to tackle climate change. But a withdrawal from the Paris climate deal \u2013 as Trump has promised \u2013 would be more serious. \u201cMy instinct would be in terms of climate, the actual implications of changes in US policy are unlikely to be a big gamechanger,\u201d said Dale. \u201cBut what could be a big gamechanger is if the US stops playing its global leadership role, and by stopping it then has significant implications for the wider international community, and the wider commitment, that could have more impacts.\u201d The energy company said the future held \u201can increasing abundance of oil\u201d, claiming there is enough technically recoverable oil in the ground to meet the world\u2019s entire demand twice over to the middle of the century. But it is not clear how much of that would be economically possible to extract, and the company does not disclose the oil price underpinning its forecasts. An Opec deal reached last year by the world\u2019s largest oil producers to curb production has helped the oil price recover from $30 a barrel last year to about $55 today. Dale would not be drawn on what he thought the price would be in 2035 but said he did not think the current level was sustainable. \u201cI look at what\u2019s happening with investment, with those major oil-producing economies, that [today\u2019s price] doesn\u2019t look like a very sustainable number,\u201d he said. The outlook predicted coal\u2019s ongoing decline would see gas overtake it as the world\u2019s second largest source of energy by 2035, with fracking for US shale driving much of the gas growth. BP said improvements in energy efficiency and an increasingly lower carbon fuel mix would slow the growth in global carbon emissions, from the 2.1% annual growth of recent years to 0.6% in the next two decades. While describing that as \u201cgood news\u201d, it admitted this still put the world on a path to dangerous global warming.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Will Donald Trump as president be good or bad for stock markets? Should investors run for the hills in fear of 1930s-style protectionist policies that may damage global trade? Or should they hang around to enjoy the possible fruits of promised tax cuts and massive infrastructure spending in the US? The debate rages fiercely and daily. Each twitch in the stock market is taken as support for one side of the argument or the other. The Dow Jones industrial average in the US has passed 20,000 for the first time because it is anticipating goodies in store; alternatively, it hasn\u2019t moved terribly far since mid December. Both statements are accurate. Meanwhile, it is almost obligatory for economists and pundits to be confident about what lies ahead for investors. If there is a rough consensus, it\u2019s that a big fiscal stimulus in the US would eventually encounter the stiff breezes of a strong dollar and higher interest rates, and there is a risk of a bust one day if Trumpist protectionism becomes truly heavy. That extremely loose working theory seems as good as any. But here\u2019s a sharper take on the great guessing game from Terry Smith, whose \u00a39bn Fundsmith equity fund has performed strongly since its launch in 2010 (disclosure: I am an investor). This is Smith\u2019s shortlist of macro factors that could affect companies and markets in the near future: Brexit, China, \u201cdemonetisation\u201d in India, the French presidential election, the German election, interest rates, Korea, Trump, quantitative easing by the European Central Bank, Syria and the oil price. Smith\u2019s point is that even if you could read developments vaguely well and get your timing right, there is a second-order problem. \u201cTo usefully employ your predictions, you would not only have to make mostly correct predictions, but you would also need to gauge what the markets expected to occur in order to predict how they would react. Good luck with that,\u201d he says. Well, quite. One way or another, Trump\u2019s policies \u2013 not just the economic ones \u2013 will have a profound effect on financial markets. So will some or all of Smith\u2019s other factors. It could hardly be otherwise. But there should be no shame in saying the investment implications are currently as clear as mud. Honours for business people should be going, going, gong Sir Philip Hampton, the chairman of GlaxoSmithKline and former chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, offered an excellent argument the other day for why highly paid business folk should not get knighthoods. Senior businessmen and women tend to be showered with so much money that it would be better to reserve the honours system for those who don\u2019t get to collect big bucks. \u201cI think to get both financial rewards and other recognition is just a bit too easy,\u201d said Hampton (who, it should be pointed out, got his gong for public service). Well said. Hampton could have added a second argument. Business careers can only be judged properly when they are over, and often some time after that. This is the Fred Goodwin problem. The former chief executive of RBS (before Hampton\u2019s time) was a hero until the bank sank. Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood. James Crosby, former chief executive of HBOS, the other great British banking disaster, gave his award back before he could suffer a similar fate. Sir Philip Green still has a gong (for now), but even if the Topshop owner eventually coughs up a few hundred million quid for the BHS pension fund, it\u2019s hard to imagine it would be awarded today. Labour is also calling for Sir John Rose, the former chief executive of Rolls-Royce, to lose his knighthood after the engine manufacturing company admitted to bribery and corruption during his period at the top. Handing out mid-career gongs is like awarding medals for a marathon while the race is still in progress. Most directors\u2019 contracts at FTSE 100 companies these days acknowledge the point as it applies to bonuses, by including clawback clauses. A knighthood that could be routinely clawed back would be a nonsense \u2013 the Goodwin case caused a huge kerfuffle, remember. Better just to drop the gongs for corporate business leaders. Investors lose appetite for Restaurant Group Shares in Restaurant Group were overcooked at 700p a year ago. Now they\u2019re 300p, and the 13% decline on Wednesday indicates investors\u2019 loss of appetite. You can\u2019t blame them. The chief executive, Andy McCue, recruited to revitalise a group that includes Garfunkel\u2019s and Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s, is impressed by \u201cmy colleagues\u2019 passion\u201d, but little else, it seems.

Each twitch in the stock market is taken as support for one side of the argument or the other. The Dow Jones industrial average in the US has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/25/dow-jones-industrial-average-breaks-record-20000\">passed 20,000 for the first time</a> because it is anticipating goodies in store; alternatively, it hasn\u2019t moved terribly far since mid December.

      "bodyText": "From Balenciaga\u2019s \u00a3845-a-pair high-top black python trainers for men to a full-length trenchcoat sported by Rihanna, snakeskin \u2013 or python in particular \u2013 is having something of a fashion moment. Demand for the luxury patterned leather is riding so high that Kering \u2013 the company behind big brands including Gucci, Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen \u2013 has built its own python farm. The Paris-based company has set up a farm in Thailand, complete with breeding stock, and the snakes will be raised in \u201cthe best conditions for animals, farmers and the ecosystem\u201d before they are turned into shoes, bags and belts. Kering said it was investing in the farm to provide a sustainable source of skins. The project comes amid growing pressure from campaigners over the use of exotic animal skins for fashion. Animal rights group Peta recently revealed it had bought shares in LVMH, the fashion house which owns Louis Vuitton, Dior and Givenchy, in an effort to fight what it sees as animal rights abuses. Peta has previously taken stakes in Prada and Hermes as part of its campaign against the use of exotic skins including alligator and crocodile. Kering said its farm would begin producing adult skins in 2018, with provision of \u201ca significant number\u201d expected by 2020. Commercial farms already exist in south-east Asia and China, but the system is widely used to \u201claunder\u201d illegally caught wild pythons \u2013 to the extent that most supposedly farmed python skin from Cambodia, Indonesia and Laos is considered suspect. In the past, farming of the reticulated python and Burmese python \u2013 two of the world\u2019s largest snakes \u2013 has beenregarded as uneconomic, because the snakes take about three years to mature and are difficult to care for and breed in captivity. Marie-Claire Daveu, chief sustainability officer for Kering, said: \u201cThis is a long-term commitment to developing sustainable and responsible sourcing of Kering\u2019s python skins \u2013 it takes time to ensure this is done to the highest standards.\u201d The farm, she said, was intended to secure the supply of skins and show how farming could be done sustainably and humanely. Kering said it began looking at alternative ways to source precious skins about three years ago as part of its involvement in the Python Conservation Partnership, a body which unveiled a $1bn (\u00a3795m) illegal annual trade in the snake\u2019s skin. The extent of the trade was highlighted last year when the Chinese government recovered 68,000 smuggled python skins worth $48m \u2013 or about \u00a3560 each \u2013 \u2013 thought to have come from Vietnam, according to reports in local state media. About 500,000 skins are now imported legally from south-east Asia into Europe each year, where they are turned into designer accessories. That total is up 40% on a decade ago, according to a PCP report. Kering said it did not expect to stop sourcing skins from the wild under the convention on international trade in endangered species (Cites) scheme. The legal trade in wild skins, it said, provides jobs for local communities and can help support the protection of the reptiles in their own habitat. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to remove precious skins [from our products] but we want to be sure that skin doesn\u2019t destroy the species when they come from the wild and if it comes from farming that it has the best conditions for animals, farmers and the ecosystem,\u201d said Daveu. The python farm is part of Kering\u2019s efforts to improve its sustainability and environmental standards. The luxury fashion house is asking all its brands to use more sustainable raw materials and fabrics such as organic cotton and merino wool produced on sustainable farms in New Zealand. All the group\u2019s brands, which include Stella McCartney and Balenciaga, are developing action plans and 10% of their chief executives\u2019 annual bonus will be dependent on them meeting sustainability promises. The company has been piloting a number of other ideas, including using only ethically-mined gold and heavy-metal-free leather tanning, and is now aiming to use more of these materials.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Dow Jones industrial average surpasses 20,000 to record high", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Dow Jones industrial average finally broke through the 20,000 barrier on Wednesday morning \u2013 a historic high for the leading stock market index and one it has been close to breaching since Christmas. The Dow, which first nearly topped 20,000 on 13 December and again on 6 January, when it came within 0.37 points of the landmark, finally broke through after the opening bell was rung on Wall Street by Ashton Poole, CEO of lender Triangle Capital. When the closing bell was rung by executives from InBev, brewers of Stella Artois, traders whooped and cheered a new milestone in the index, which closed at a record high of 20,068. The market had rallied sharply in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory but seemed to lose steam ahead of his first day in office. It broke the barrier on Wednesday morning after infrastructure stocks rose sharply ahead of the market\u2019s opening, boosted by Trump\u2019s renewed pledge to build a wall along the Mexican border and talks of massive infrastructure investment. A rise in Boeing\u2019s shares, which reported better than expected results on Wednesday, and the continued rally in the financial sector that has accompanied Trump\u2019s win also helped push the Dow over the line. The Dow record comes as the S&amp;P 500 index, tech-heavy Nasdaq and London\u2019s FTSE 100 stock market index have all hit record highs in recent weeks. The Dow, which has risen about 9% since Trump\u2019s victory, is probably the best-known US stock indicator although its limited measure is not the one favoured by most market professionals. It measures the performance of 30 of the largest publicly owned companies based in the United States, including Apple, ExxonMobil and Goldman Sachs. While it has inched over the 20,000 mark, overall its latest rise has been sudden. The Dow surpassed 19,000 for the first time just 42 days ago \u2013 two days before the Thanksgiving holiday and has risen 5.6% since then. Similar sharp rises in the index have been followed by sharp falls. The last time the Dow added 1,000 points so quickly was in May 1999. The index passed 10,000 in that same year, the height of the dotcom bubble, only to lose much of those gains in the coming crash. But market watchers said they believed this rally was on a more solid footing. The recent rapid rise has been driven in part by expectations that Trump will introduce policies that will boost growth and cut regulatory pressures on US companies. Trump has pledged to roll back the Dodd-Frank regulations brought in to more tightly control financial institutions in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown. Banks and other financial companies have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the recent share-price rise. But the rise comes against a strong upward trend in the Dow that stretches back to the end of the recession in 2009 and the decision of the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates, making shares a more attractive investment. Few on Wall Street seemed overexcited by the news. When the Dow hit 10,000, Richard Grasso, then chairman of the New York stock exchange, closed the day\u2019s trading with Rudy Giuliani, New York\u2019s mayor. They threw \u201cDow 10,000\u201d caps to a cheering crowd of traders. The reaction was more muted this time, in part because so much trading has moved online since 1999 and also because the new level comes after an eight-year run of rises. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said given the overall health of the US economy he would have expected a broadly similar rise had Hillary Clinton won the election. Any changes to regulation Trump has planned could take years to pass and implement, he said, and investors were more interested in shorter-term trends. \u201cI would hesitate to call it a Trump rally,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d say 80% of where we are now is down to fundamentals and probably another 20% is post-election enthusiasm.\u201d Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Financial Group, called the news \u201cpsychologically important\u201d but said it was unlikely to set a new benchmark for the index, and that the Dow would probably dip above and below the 20,000 level for some time. \u201cThe surge in financials is probably one of the biggest fuel sources for this rise,\u201d said Ablin. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know if it\u2019s sustainable; there is a lot of expectation not only that these new policies will be passed but also that they will work.\u201d Rapid rises in the Dow have been followed by equally rapid falls. The Dow peaked at 11,722.98 in January 2000. After the dotcom bubble burst it took more than seven years for the Dow to hit its next milestone of 12,000, in October 2006. The Dow topped 14,000 in July 2007 \u2013 the height of the housing bubble and less than three months after passing 13,000. After the crash it took the Dow six years to return to that level. But Wren predicted 2017 would be a relatively stable year for US stock markets. \u201cI don\u2019t think 20,000 is a sign of overenthusiasm or froth,\u201d said Wren. The Dow hit its record high after a new poll showed consumer confidence surged in December. The Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index rose to 113.7, up from 109.4 in November. Its \u201cexpectations index\u201d, which measures consumers\u2019 confidence about the future, increased sharply from 94.4 to 105.5, a 13-year high. Older consumers, however, were markedly more optimistic than younger ones. \u201cThe post-election surge in optimism for the economy, jobs and income prospects, as well as for stock prices, which reached a 13-year high, was most pronounced among older consumers,\u201d said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board. \u201cLooking ahead to 2017, consumers\u2019 continued optimism will depend on whether or not their expectations are realized.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A comic revival of Enid Blyton\u2019s Famous Five characters gave WH Smith reason for cheer over the key festive trading period. Strong sales of spoof titles such as Five on Brexit Island, Five Give up the Booze, and the Ladybird Books for Grown-Ups series, helped to lift sales by 1% at stores open for more than a year over the 21 weeks to 21 January. Total sales rose by 2%. While customers returned to the adventures of Julian, Dick, Anne, George and dog Timmy, first introduced to the public during the second world war, they turned their backs on adult colouring books. Hugely popular over the same period a year earlier, sales tumbled by about 60% to 70%, according to the WH Smith chief executive, Stephen Clarke. \u201cThey have fallen off a cliff,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cLast year was their first year really and people are no longer colouring in the way they were.\u201d The retailer, which this year celebrates its 225th birthday, said higher customer numbers at its airport shops over Christmas also helped boosted trade. Sales within the travel division \u2013 which also includes motorway service stations, hospitals and railway stations \u2013 grew by 5%, but were down by 3% at its shops on UK high streets. Clarke said the group was up against the toughest year-on-year sales comparisons in more than a decade, after the first rise in Christmas like-for-like sales at high street in 12 years last year, fuelled by the colouring craze. \u201cAs a result of the performance in travel we expect group profit growth for the year to be slightly ahead of plan,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cWhile there is some uncertainty in the broader economic environment, we remain confident that the group is well positioned for the year ahead as we continue to focus on profitable growth, cash generation and investing in new opportunities.\u201d Clarke said WH Smith customers would be protected from Brexit-related price rises this year, partly because only about 5% of the goods and materials bought by the company are priced in dollars. Some retailers have warned that the weak pound will lead to a rise in prices this year, as materials imported from abroad are more expensive. \u201cWe\u2019re in a slightly better position than other retailers, particularly clothing retailers and electronics,\u201d said Clark. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to avoid putting our prices up.\u201d Shares in the retailer rose by 7.6% to \u00a315.93, making the retailer the biggest riser on the FTSE 250. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said the trading update would be a source of relief for investors. \u201cAlthough the comparisons were tough, the business has come through well. How far the 225th anniversary celebrations of the company help trade this year remains to be seen, but the City will be relieved by the strong Christmas trading performance,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from June 2006 to May 2009 Markets don\u2019t like surprises. The pound has been responsive to the May government\u2019s many self-inflicted wounds. The supreme court decision was widely anticipated so was not much of a surprise and so the pound didn\u2019t move much. The pound moves down every time the prospect of a cliff-edge Brexit rears its ugly head. It strengthens on the possibility that the economic Neanderthals are not going to have their way. As I have said frequently, the markets prevent Theresa May and her government from saying and doing stupid stuff. The courts now seem to be doing the same. The weakening of the pound has already had a big impact on prices in the shops. The consumer prices index rose to 1.6%, pushed up by airfares, food prices and fuel, it was the fastest pace of price rises for two-and-a-half years. Prices paid by factories for materials and energy rose by 15.8% in December on a year ago, the biggest jump since September 2011. The rise in prices, which is going to continue, will begin to catch up with the growth rate of wages and overtake it, which means workers\u2019 real spending power will start falling again. Real wages are still 3.5% below their levels in 2008. So living standards are set to fall again. It also looks like the UK\u2019s much-vaunted job-generating machine is slowing to a halt. Economists expect higher costs for firms to continue filtering through to shop prices. The really bad news in December was that retail sales volumes dropped 1.9%, the sharpest fall for more than four years and far worse than economists\u2019 forecasts for a 0.1% dip. Spending is expected to slow further as rising inflation eats into pay packets. There were signs of a housing market slowdown in the latest snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. A net balance of 24% of surveyors saw house prices increase rather than decrease in December, a slowdown from 29% in November. That was the first drop in the main measure since the aftermath of the referendum. For economists this has been the crisis that keeps on giving. For ordinary people it has been a crisis that keeps on hurting. That is why there were votes for Trump and Brexit. Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC and former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from October 2006 to May 2011 The basic picture of the UK economy has not changed over the past month. Even though December retail sales were disappointing, taking the last three months of 2016 together, the volume of high street and internet sales was still 5.6% up on a year ago. Taking 2016 as a whole, retail sales volumes grew by nearly 5%, the strongest year for over a decade. The consumer was therefore supporting growth quite strongly in the final quarter of last year. At the same time, the world economy appears to be picking up. One indicator I watch closely is the growth of global air traffic, which is very well correlated with growth across the world economy. When people are flying more for business and leisure, it is a good indicator of higher confidence and economic growth. The International Air Transport Association reports that passenger air travel was up 7.6% on a year ago in November, with healthy growth in all the three main regions of the world economy \u2013 North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. This is in tune with other positive global growth indicators such as the purchasing managers\u2019 surveys, and positive employment indicators from the US and Europe. So for now, consumer spending and strong global growth are supporting the UK economy \u2013 and we have yet to see the negative impact on investment which many forecasters are expecting in 2017. However, there are two important straws in the wind that do point to slower growth. First, inflation has picked up to 1.6%, narrowing the gap between wage increases and consumer price inflation and squeezing the increase in disposable income, despite a slight pick-up in average earnings. A further rise in inflation to about 3% should be expected this year as import price increases come through the pipeline \u2013 adding to the squeeze on the real spending power of consumers. The second straw in the wind is a slowdown in jobs growth. The employment growth trend \u2013 which has been in place for four to five years now \u2013 has flattened off, according to the latest labour market figures. Unemployment has not increased because the number of people available for work has also levelled out. But the signals from the labour market are consistent with slower economic growth this year driven by heightened uncertainty following the Brexit vote. In 2017 and 2018, we should expect to see economic growth of close to 1.5%, below the 2% which the UK has achieved over the seven years of recovery so far.",

      "bodyText": "The pressure on the pound from Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU is stoking inflation, denting household finances and putting a brake on spending, according to a Guardian analysis. Official figures this week are expected to confirm the economy enjoyed a strong finish to 2016 as companies and consumers continued to shrug off the shock of the Brexit vote. But signs of a spending slowdown, corporate jitters around the triggering of article 50 and rising prices point to a more challenging growth outlook in 2017. Seven months on from the referendum, the Guardian\u2019s monthly tracker of economic news shows the weaker pound is being felt in the real economy more keenly than ever, as it raises the cost of imports such as energy and food and that gets passed on to consumers as higher prices in the shops. To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE. The dashboard for January shows a worse than expected performance in four of the eight categories. Two were better than expected and unemployment was as expected. Inflation was higher than economists had forecast, hitting its highest level for more than two years in December. Writing in the Guardian, a former member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), Andrew Sentance, said two factors pointed to economic growth losing momentum: a slowdown in employment and rising inflation. \u201cFor now, consumer spending and strong global growth are supporting the UK economy \u2013 and we have yet to see the negative impact on investment which many forecasters are expecting in 2017,\u201d said Sentance, a senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC. \u201cBut the signals from the labour market are consistent with slower economic growth this year driven by heightened uncertainty following the Brexit vote. In 2017 and 2018, we should expect to see economic growth of close to 1.5%, below the 2% which the UK has achieved over the seven years of recovery so far.\u201d Among the more downbeat measures in the latest dashboard, the housing market lost momentum at the close of 2016, with property price gains easing and fewer sales. The UK\u2019s trade position deteriorated further on the latest official measures as a jump in imports eclipsed a pick-up in exports. And in a worrying omen for an economy reliant on consumer spending, retail sales fell over the crucial Christmas period. The public finances were in a slightly worse state than expected for December, but revisions to November figures improved the government\u2019s chances of meeting its borrowing target for the full year. On a brighter note, surveys from the manufacturing, construction and services sectors signal they all managed to expand again in December, beating economists\u2019 forecasts and boding well for official GDP figures due on Thursday. That first snapshot of fourth-quarter economic growth is expected to show the economy expanded by 0.5%, almost matching the third quarter\u2019s robust growth of 0.6%. In the jobs market, unemployment remains low and wage growth is outpacing inflation, for now. But in a sign firms are growing more wary of hiring new staff, the number of people in employment has dropped and experts warn that firms\u2019 rising costs will limit their ability and willingness to award pay rises this year. It remains to be seen whether December\u2019s unexpected drop in retail volumes will prove to be a blip or evidence of a squeeze on consumers. Publishing the sales figures, the Office for National Statistics warned against reading too much into one month alone. It instead highlighted quarterly data showing retail sales grew in the final three months of 2016. Reports on Christmas trading from retailers themselves meanwhile were largely positive, with some noting an early boost in November from Black Friday sales events. But as inflation starts to bite and the jobs market shows signs of cooling, economists warn household budgets will deteriorate this year and retailers will struggle to keep sales rising. The industry itself is cautious in its outlook, with the British Retail Consortium flagging \u201cgrowing inflationary pressures and persisting economic and political uncertainty\u201d. The Bank of England governor said this month that consumers appeared to have looked through Brexit worries to carry on spending. But in his first speech of 2017, Mark Carney also highlighted that the brisk pace of spending had been accompanied by a rise in household borrowing. The Bank, which presents its latest outlook for the economy next week, expects pressures on consumers to rise further this year as a weak currency stokes inflation. The pound\u2019s sharp moves over the last month have underscored its vulnerability to government announcements on the Brexit process. Sterling skidded to a three-month low against the dollar before Theresa May\u2019s key Brexit speech as news leaked out that she would take the UK out of Europe\u2019s single market. It then recovered as she confirmed any deal would be put to a vote but fell on this week\u2019s supreme court ruling that MPs and peers must give their consent before the government can trigger article 50 and formally initiate Brexit. David Blanchflower, also a former member of the MPC, said the pound was being buffeted by politics. \u201cThe pound has been responsive to the May government\u2019s many self-inflicted wounds,\u201d said Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US. \u201cThe pound moves down every time the prospect of a cliff-edge Brexit rears its ugly head. It strengthens on the possibility that the economic Neanderthals are not going to have their way.\u201d On stock markets, the pound\u2019s loss has been the FTSE 100\u2019s gain as the index continues to be flattered by a weak currency. The index hit a fresh record peak earlier this month and broke a near 20-year record for its longest run of closing highs. The drop in the pound has boosted the earnings of many of the companies in the FTSE 100 that report in dollars and it is up 13% since the 23 June referendum.",

It then recovered as she confirmed any deal would be put to a vote but fell on this week\u2019s supreme court ruling that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/24/supreme-court-brexit-ruling-parliament-vote-article-50\">MPs and peers must give their consent before the government can trigger article 50</a> and formally initiate Brexit.</p> <p>David Blanchflower, also a former member of the MPC, said the pound was being buffeted by politics.</p> <p>\u201cThe pound has been responsive to the May government\u2019s many self-inflicted wounds,\u201d said Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US.</p> <p>\u201cThe pound moves down every time the prospect of a cliff-edge Brexit rears its ugly head. It strengthens on the possibility that the economic Neanderthals are not going to have their way.\u201d</p> <p>On stock markets, the pound\u2019s loss has been the FTSE 100\u2019s gain as the index continues to be flattered by a weak currency. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/10/ftse-100-on-course-for-longest-ever-winning-streak\">The index hit a fresh record peak earlier this month</a> and broke a near 20-year record for its longest run of closing highs. The drop in the pound has boosted the earnings of many of the companies in the FTSE 100 that report in dollars and it is up 13% since the 23 June referendum.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The price of some toys could rise by up to 15% as a result of the plunging pound, manufacturers have warned. Lego and the producer of Peppa Pig merchandise are among the companies to have announced price rises recently. Natasha Crookes, spokeswoman for the British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA), said most UK toy makers, who typically design products in Britain but have them manufactured and imported from east Asia, had managed to contain price rises until now. \u201cToys are produced with an 18-month lead-in time, so while some conversations about pricing have already taken place, clearly some tough commercial decisions are having to be made now,\u201d Crookes said. She was speaking at the Toy Fair, a three-day BTHA event at the Olympia in London featuring 270 exhibitors showcasing toys and games likely to be popular next Christmas. \u201cWe are predicting price rises of between 5% and 15%, depending on the category and materials used. The UK toy industry is a very resilient and creative one, which last year launched 63,500 new products. \u201cTo sustain growth we look forward to more clarity on the process of Brexit, particularly the relationship with Europe on free trade agreements, customs union access and favourable tariffs with World Trade Organization members.\u201d Manufacturers suggest recommended retail prices (RRP) and retailers decide whether to pass on any increases to the customer or absorb them. Despite the squeeze on household incomes and economic uncertainty after the Brexit vote in June, the BTHA \u2013 which represents 80% of the industry \u2013 said the \u201cresilient\u201d sector had enjoyed strong growth in 2016 to make it the fourth largest market in the world after the US, China and Japan. The UK toy market experienced a 6.3% rise in sales last year, pushing up its value to more than \u00a33.5bn for the first time, according to figures released at the fair. It emerged in December that Lego planned to increase its UK prices by 5% from this month as it became the latest manufacturer to respond to the fall in sterling. The Danish firm confirmed it would raise the prices of its playsets, bricks and mini-figures as a result of currency fluctuations. It said it would consider further increases if the pound did not recover. That means the RRP of a Star Wars Lego Death Star set has gone up by \u00a320 to \u00a3419, while the price of a Doctor Who Lego set has risen by \u00a32.49 to \u00a352.48. Ty UK, the UK division of the US manufacturer of popular furry collectable animals \u2013 with licensed deals including Peppa Pig \u2013 said it had increased its prices by 11% at the end of 2016. \u201cWe took a hit because of exchange rate fluctuations so we felt we had no choice, although we are guaranteeing a fixed price for the rest of this year,\u201d said the company\u2019s games designer, Morley Lester. Sam Ireland, operations manager of BigJigs toys, which makes wooden pre-school educational toys and trades in 98 countries, said the Folkestone-based company was putting up its prices by 10%. The market research firm NPD said overall growth in the market was largely driven by the popularity of collectibles, which experienced a year-on-year increase of 44% and account for almost a quarter of toys sold. A new spin on Meccano At the Toy Fair, Meccano\u2019s owner Spin Master unveiled a red and black robotic spider that can be programmed via an app to walk and guard its owner\u2019s bedroom door. It even squirts water at unsuspecting intruders. The \u00a399.99 kit, aimed at children aged 10 and older, has 300 pieces and can be assembled in about 90 minutes. The completed spider spans about half a metre. The toy will go on sale in the UK in August.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Knighthoods and other public honours should not be handed to highly paid businesspeople, one of the UK\u2019s most respected company chairmen has told MPs. Sir Philip Hampton, who is chairman of pharmaceuticals group GlaxoSmithKline and was awarded his knighthood for public service, said businesspeople were rewarded with money, and that the honours system should be directed at those who do not benefit from big financial inducements. \u201cThe rewards for being in business should be primarily financial and other rewards and appreciations probably should be more directed at people who are not getting financial rewards,\u201d he said. \u201cI think to get both financial rewards and other recognition is a bit too easy.\u201d Honours handed to company bosses have been in sharp focus in recent months. In October, MPs voted for Sir Philip Green to lose his knighthood after the collapse of department store of BHS \u2013 a symbolic move \u2013 while the bribery scandal at Rolls-Royce has sparked calls from Labour for the firm\u2019s former chief executive Sir John Rose to lose his honour. Rolls-Royce was last week forced to pay \u00a3671m in a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) after it admitted to \u201cegregious criminality\u201d that stretched back more than two decades. The DPA allows the engineering group to avoid formal criminal charges, although individuals working for Rolls-Royce at the time could still face proceedings. Rose was knighted in 2003 in recognition of his services to the defence and aerospace industries. Green\u2019s family received \u00a3580m in dividends, interest on loans and rent from BHS before he sold the ailing business for \u00a31. Just 13 months later BHS collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a \u00a3571m pension deficit. The billionaire was awarded his knighthood in 2006 for services to retail. Fred Goodwin, who ran RBS until its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout in 2008, was stripped of his knighthood in 2012. In the recent New Year honours list fewer big names from the world of business appeared. The chief executive of the Lloyd\u2019s of London insurance market, Inga Beale, was awarded a damehood, while there were CBEs for designer Anya Hindmarch, Mumsnet co-founder Justine Roberts and Simon Walker, the outgoing boss of the Institute of Directors. Only one City businessman, the former chairman of PwC accountancy firm Ian Powell, received a knighthood. Hampton said: \u201cThe honours system has moved away from having businesspeople having rewards and I think that\u2019s right.\u201d He was appearing before MPs on the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy select committee and was among a number of witnesses giving evidence on corporate governance. Hampton, who has also been chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland and Sainsbury\u2019s, was also asked to justify high executive pay. He did not answer directly but said bonuses were too easy for top bosses to earn: \u201cThe structure of executive pay has not been as well connected to performance as it should have been ... There\u2019s been far too much focus on incentive pay.\u201d He said bonuses ended up paying outeven if performance was indifferent, adding: \u201cWe should try have a move back to much less incentive pay and, if necessary to keep the level of rewards competitive, more basic pay.\u201d Hampton was giving evidence as part of the review, which he iand Dame Helen Alexander are leading, into how to get more women in to more senior roles below board level. The government is also facing calls to force companies to recognise executive pay is a problem from a group of bodies including ICSA, which represents company secretaries, the Institute of Directors and the Trades Union Congress. In a letter to Theresa May they say the debate should not be shelved.",

The billionaire was awarded his knighthood in 2006 for services to retail. </p> <p>Fred Goodwin, who ran RBS until its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout in 2008, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/31/fred-goodwin-stripped-of-knighthood\">was stripped of his knighthood in 2012</a>.</p> <p>In the recent New Year honours list fewer big names from the world of business appeared. The chief executive of the Lloyd\u2019s of London insurance market, Inga Beale, was awarded a damehood, while there were CBEs for designer Anya Hindmarch, Mumsnet co-founder Justine Roberts and Simon Walker, the outgoing boss of the Institute of Directors. Only one City businessman, the former chairman of PwC accountancy firm Ian Powell, received a knighthood.</p> <p>Hampton said: \u201cThe honours system has moved away from having businesspeople having rewards and I think that\u2019s right.\u201d </p> <p>He was appearing before MPs on the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy select committee and was among a number of witnesses giving evidence on corporate governance.<br></p> <p>Hampton, who has also been chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland and Sainsbury\u2019s, was also asked to justify high executive pay. He did not answer directly but said bonuses were too easy for top bosses to earn: \u201cThe structure of executive pay has not been as well connected to performance as it should have been ... There\u2019s been far too much focus on incentive pay.\u201d</p> <p> He said bonuses ended up paying outeven if performance was indifferent, adding: \u201cWe should try have a move back to much less incentive pay and, if necessary to keep the level of rewards competitive, more basic pay.\u201d</p> <p>Hampton was giving evidence as part of the review, which he iand Dame Helen Alexander are leading, into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/uk-companies-women-executive-committees-philip-hampton-helen-alexander\">how to get more women in to more senior roles below board level</a>.</p> <p>The government is also facing calls to force companies to recognise executive pay is a problem from a group of bodies including ICSA, which represents company secretaries, the Institute of Directors and the Trades Union Congress. In a letter to Theresa May they say the debate should not be shelved.</p>",
