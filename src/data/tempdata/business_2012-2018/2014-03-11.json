      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group, Britain's largest mutual, is in renewed turmoil after its chief executive walked out, branding the organisation as \"ungovernable\" and raising questions about the future of the 170-year-old supermarket, funeral homes and pharmacy business. Euan Sutherland, who joined only 10 months ago, did not turn up to work on Monday after the Observer published details of his \u00a36.6m pay deal for 2013 and 2014. The report prompted him to launch a blistering attack on \"an individual or individuals\" attempting to undermine him in a posting on the group's Facebook page. That protest in turn provoked an angry response from Co-op staff and members. Although the 45-year-old former head of B&amp;Q had told the group's 90,000 staff \u2013 who are braced for at least 5,000 job cuts \u2013 that he was determined to see though \"the vital transformation of our business\", he had a sudden change of heart. On Monday he fired off a resignation email to the Co-op's chair, Ursula Lidbetter, telling her the Manchester-based group was \"ungovernable\". As he quit he attacked the group's \"professional and commercial governance\" and pledged not to take \u00a33m of controversial retention payments. However, he will still have been paid \u00a32m for 2013, including \u00a31m for buying him out of incentive deals at his previous employer. He is likely to be handed some or all of his \u00a31.5m salary for 2014. Other members of his executive team are still expected to be handed retention deals of at least \u00a38m. Sutherland's departure exposed the rift between those keen to reform the group, which is on course to report \u00a32bn of losses through its banking operation, which nearly went bust last year, and those who are reluctant to embrace the changes he thought necessary to restore the fortunes of the ailing business. The Co-op is also attempting to recover from a string of reputational hits, including allegations of drug taking by the former chairman of its bank, Paul Flowers, a methodist minister. Amid fears for the future of the debt-laden group, which has 4,500 outlets across Britain, it was left to the finance director, Richard Pennycook (best known for transforming the supermarket Morrisons) to temporarily step up to the role of acting chief executive. He pledged to \"plot a steady course\" over the coming months. Lidbetter, who was herself parachuted into the top job during last year's crisis, had convened a late-night conference call of the board after failing to persuade Sutherland to change his mind. She said his departure should now be \"a catalyst for the real and necessary change which the group must go through\". At the hastily convened board meeting, which ended at close to midnight, a number of management changes were agreed to alter the boardroom, which is currently occupied by 20 members of the Co-operative moment and one newly appointed independent member, Lord Myners, the Labour peer and former chairman of Guardian Media Group. Myners is said to have fought hard to persuade the board to embrace his ideas to create two separate boards \u2013 one modelled on a standard plc with an independent chair, executive directors and part-time non-executives, and another made up of members of the Co-operative movement. It is not clear if the existing Co-op board was unanimous in their support for Myners' plan, but it must yet be ratified by the traditional regional boards. It was not clear if the regional members were prepared to adopt the changes as some were said to have been rankled by Myners' plans, during a meeting in Manchester two weeks ago. Jim Lee, former secretary of the Scottish Co-operative party and an influential member of the Co-op movement, said: \"I'm pleased that Euan Sutherland has gone. I know that there has to be change but I think he imagined we would agree to a traditional business model being imposed on the Co-op. That was never going to happen.\" Another source close to the group said it would be \"disingenuous to say there aren't people already uncomfortable with the changes\" which would reduce the influence of \"democrats\", who trace their roots back to the Rochdale pioneers of 1844. \"What we have here is a clash of cultures between plc people and the Co-op people. Euan is a plc animal and he is used to responses on a timescale and of a type that the Co-op isn't used to. We have tried this in the past, to bring people in from outside at a senior level, and it has never worked. Because they have not grown through the culture they try to make the beast dance in a way that the beast doesn't want to dance,\" the source said. Andre Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School, said the argument about Sutherland's pay illustrated the clash of cultures. \"By tendering his resignation, Sutherland was laying down the gauntlet to those who were questioning his more managerial approach. \"While Sutherland's resignation is likely to make some members of the co-operative movement happy it will further undermine the group's reputation. This means stakeholders are going to get even more jittery. It will also make finding a new candidate for the job difficult. A faltering Co-op is bad news for the UK economy as a whole. It is a significant player in many sectors such as retail, funeral care and banking.\" Sutherland's parting shot was to call on the group to reduce its \u00a31.2bn debt and drive through efficiencies. He also called for fundamental governance reform and a revitalised membership. He had been leading a \"have your say\" public campaign which asked if \u00a31m of donations to the Co-operative party and its 32 MPs aligned to the Labour party should continue. Gareth Thomas, the MP who chairs the Co-op Party NEC, said it was right Sutherland had quit if he could not be a successful boss of the group. \"The Co-operative is going through a tough and turbulent time and what is now important is that a chief executive is recruited who has a vision for coupling the best of the Co-op's past with a clear vision for the future,\" Thomas said. The future plans of Sutherland \u2013 who had adopted a high public profile as he attempted to steer through change \u2013 were not immediately clear. He was expected to spend Wednesday at a retail conference to discuss the subject of leadership. On Tuesday evening he cancelled. In your face As details of his \u00a36.6m pay packet emerged, Euan Sutherland went on Facebook to express his anger about his pay being made public: \"I'm very sorry to have to report that we have had yet another leak to the media ... It appears that, once again, the leak has come from our group boardroom. We seem to have an individual, or individuals, determined to undermine me personally, my team and the rest of the group board.\" Among the replies: \"Good to see that even with the company going down the pan, you can still get your bonus.\" \"Have we totally lost the plot? I think so.\" \"Hi Euan, can you please justify why bonuses are paid when the bank is making a loss?\" \"It's worse than it seems ... these are retention bonuses, so Euan can perform woefully, but as long as he stays put he will get it. Unbelievable\" \"After 40 years I'm looking for another bank - the only thing keeping me there at the moment is concern for the employees lower down the tree.\" \"A real CEO would have deferred any increase until the mess is sorted.\" \"No man is worth all this money. We are not corporate, we are a cooperative, if he wanted this sort of money he should have gone elsewhere.\" \"If you really believed that in the current climate you could get away with this sort of remuneration without some form of public comment then clearly you are not in the right job.\" \"I have had a Co-op bank account for 40 years. This is the end of it. I'll have no more to do with the Co-op.\" \"I can't believe what I have read \u2026 I have worked for the Co-op for nearly 25 years. l have bored people to death extolling its ethics only to find out it didn't have any and everyone at the top is simply out for what [they] can get.\"",

It will be music to the ears of mission chiefs representing bailed out Cyprus\u2019 lenders at the EU, ECB and IMF, that she is a big advocate of scaling back the island\u2019s public sector and pressing ahead with the overhaul of its near defunct banking system. The 58-year-old will officially assume the role on April 11, a day after Demetriades leaves the post as prescripted by European Central Bank law. The presidential palace said ECB head, Mario Draghi, who had previously expressed disquiet over Anastastiades\u2019 handling of the governor, had been apprised of the appointment. </p> <p>With her well-established track record as an independent and autonomous figure, Georghadji\u2019s appointment is clearly aimed at dashing notions that she is a political appointee who will simply follow the president\u2019s line. </p> <p>But Demetriades\u2019 unexpected decision to step down \u2013 and his cursory replacement \u2013 could set a precedent in the way nation governments treat central bank governors, insiders say.</p> <p>From the outset the former Leicester University economics professor has made no secret of the fact this his \u201cdysfunctional relationship\u201d with Anastasiades and other central Bank board members had hindered his role in the post. This morning, as it emerged that he had also been given a \u20ac250,000 payoff (to enforce his resignation) he hit back with a statement that not only cited \u201cpersonal and family reasons\u201d for his resignation but rejected accusations that he had failed to take adequate steps ahead of the island\u2019s spectacular banking collapse last spring. Despite the mudslinging \u2013 and there has been plenty of it over the past year \u2013 Demetriades, who leaves the position less than two years into his five-year tenure, said he had always aimed to act in the island republic\u2019s best interests by ensuring the stability of its financial system.</p> </blockquote> <h2>The statement released by Demetriades\u2019s<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> office reads:</span></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIt was a privilege to serve as Governor of the CBC.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s all for tonight. A quick reminder of the key points: Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has warned that the FX rigging scandal is at least as bad as Libor, as the BoE mounted a defence of its handling of the crisis. Here\u2019s our summary Treasury committee chairman Andrew Tyrie has responded, saying the Bank must reassure the public that it is handling the crisis well, having labelled its governance structure \u201copaque, complex and Byzantine\u201d. As my colleague Katie Allen flags up, Carney didn\u2019t argue that the Bank is in a spot: Tyrie also criticised the BoE for routinely destroys recordings of its meetings. Earlier, Carney said UK interest rates could rise, finally, to 2.5% within three years, as MPs exposed differences within the MPC over the state of the UK economy. The other key main events are: The Co-op Group has lurched deeper into crisis, with the resignation of CEO Euan Sutherland from the \u201cungovernable\u201d bank. Tributes have been paid to one of Britain\u2019s most influential union leaders, Bob Crow of the RMT, after he died aged 52 today. Fears over China have sent the copper price sliding again today.....and oil has also fallen. The OECD has predicted that the UK will grow faster than its major rivals in the first six months of 2014. The president of Cyprus has appointed a new central bank president, Chrystalla Georghadji, to succeed Panicos Demetriades who resigned last night. Back tomorrow. Thanks, as ever, for reading and commenting. GW Another important story to flag up tonight -the OECD has predicted that Britain\u2019s economy will grow fast than the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada over the first half of this year. The Paris-based body expects to see growth equal to an annual rate of 3.3% between January and the end of June -or around 0.8% in both Q1 and Q2. OECD predicts UK recovery will be strongest in G7 over first half of 2014 The drop in the copper price casts a shadow over the City tonight, where the FTSE 100 finished slightly lower at 6685, down 4 points. My colleague Nick Fletcher reports: Leading shares continued their losing streak, down for the third trading day in a row after late jitters sent copper prices lower and hit the mining sector. For much of the day, markets had been edging higher but lurking concerns about tensions in Ukraine and an economic slowdown in China refused to die down and finally got the upper hand. Added to that came talk of another possible Chinese corporate bond default, pushing Wall Street lower in early trading and sending many European markets into reverse. By the close the FTSE 100 had dipped 3.93 points to 6685.52, having earlier climbed as high at 6718. With copper falling to a four year low at one point on the Chinese worries, Antofagasta fell 18.5p to 840p and BHP Billiton lost 10p to \u00a318.12. Market report: FTSE 100 falls for third day as late Chinese jitters hit copper price Those global growth fears are also pushing the oil price down. US crude (NYMEX) just fell to $100/barrel, a drop of around 1%, for the first time since mid-February. The copper price has slumped to its lowest level since July 2010 this afternoon, as fears over China\u2019s economy continue to gnaw at investors. Copper fell another 2%, extending losses suffered on Monday. Traders continued to be spooked by data showing Chinese exports fell 1.7% in January, suggesting a sharper slowdown in the economy. Another factor is speculation that China could see more domestic bond defaults -- following the first one ever, Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology -- last week. Analysts are warning that further defaults could send more copper flowing into the markets, as the metal is used as collateral in many opaque loans made in China\u2019s shadow banking sector (Reuters has more details) Developments in the eurozone today -- Cyprus\u2019s outgoing central Bank chief, who resigned yesterday, has hit back at government\u2019s accusations that he mishandled the Mediterranean island\u2019s near economic collapse. President Nikos Anastasiades, meanwhile, has wasted no time appointing a replacement to Panicos Demetriades. Our correspondent Helena Smith explains all: In a further sign of his no nonsense approach to life, politics and business, Cyprus\u2019 president needed barely 15 hours to appoint a successor to disgraced former central bank governor Panicos Demetriades. The centre-right leader, who had been openly at war with the outgoing bank chief, an appointee of his own predecessor and unrepentant communist Demetris Christofias, said in a brief statement issued by the presidential palace that he had decided to install auditor general, Chrystalla Georghadji, to the post. A seasoned technocrat, educated in both the US and UK, Ms Georghadji has a fierce reputation as another no-nonsense figure on the island as the head of an anti-corruption watchdog who regularly reports on misuse of public funds. It will be music to the ears of mission chiefs representing bailed out Cyprus\u2019 lenders at the EU, ECB and IMF, that she is a big advocate of scaling back the island\u2019s public sector and pressing ahead with the overhaul of its near defunct banking system. The 58-year-old will officially assume the role on April 11, a day after Demetriades leaves the post as prescripted by European Central Bank law. The presidential palace said ECB head, Mario Draghi, who had previously expressed disquiet over Anastastiades\u2019 handling of the governor, had been apprised of the appointment. With her well-established track record as an independent and autonomous figure, Georghadji\u2019s appointment is clearly aimed at dashing notions that she is a political appointee who will simply follow the president\u2019s line. But Demetriades\u2019 unexpected decision to step down \u2013 and his cursory replacement \u2013 could set a precedent in the way nation governments treat central bank governors, insiders say. From the outset the former Leicester University economics professor has made no secret of the fact this his \u201cdysfunctional relationship\u201d with Anastasiades and other central Bank board members had hindered his role in the post. This morning, as it emerged that he had also been given a \u20ac250,000 payoff (to enforce his resignation) he hit back with a statement that not only cited \u201cpersonal and family reasons\u201d for his resignation but rejected accusations that he had failed to take adequate steps ahead of the island\u2019s spectacular banking collapse last spring. Despite the mudslinging \u2013 and there has been plenty of it over the past year \u2013 Demetriades, who leaves the position less than two years into his five-year tenure, said he had always aimed to act in the island republic\u2019s best interests by ensuring the stability of its financial system. The statement released by Demetriades\u2019s office reads: \u201cIt was a privilege to serve as Governor of the CBC. During my tenure my actions were always aimed at ensuring confidence and stability in our financial system and I always acted in the best interests of our country. \u201c\u0399 wish the CBC every success and I have every confidence that Cyprus will soon restore its financial strength.\u201d In other news... the National Institute of Economic and Social Research has predicted that the UK economy picked up pace a little last month. NIESR estimates that GDP grew by 0.8% in the three months to February, compared with 0.7% in the October-January quarter. The thinktank also believes the UK will finally reach its pre-crisis peak before the end of 2014. Andrew Tyrie has just issued his official response to today\u2019s hearing --criticising the Bank of England for destroying recordings of MPC meetings, and over its inquiry over the forex rigging issue: On MPC records \u201cI have yet to hear a good argument against keeping verbatim records of MPC meetings, published with a long time lag - probably longer than the maximum term of an external member. \u201cThere seem to me to be a good number of arguments for keeping such records, among them, to bolster public confidence that the minutes published after MPC hearings are an accurate reflection of what was said.\u201d On the Bank\u2019s forex inquiry \u201cThis is the first real test for the Bank of England\u2019s new governance structures. Early signs are not encouraging. \u201cIt has taken some time for the Bank\u2019s Oversight Committee to take the lead on accusations of misconduct relating to forex. \u201cAny review commissioned by the Oversight Committee must be demonstrably independent. It should have a remit broad enough to ensure no stone will be left unturned. \u201cThe Committee will look closely at the mandate and terms of reference of the work commissioned from Travers Smith to ensure that it provides for comprehensive coverage and independence. \u201cThe public needs confidence that the Bank\u2019s governance structures will ensure that it gets to the bottom of forex-related misconduct allegations. The public also needs confidence that any misconduct in other areas will be discovered.\u201d The other surprising thing we learned today is that the Bank destroys the recordings of the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s meetings. This, it says, is because transcripts were hard to follow -- and their existence might deter MPC members from holding a free-flowing debate. I\u2019m tempted to call today\u2019s event a \u2018marathon\u2019 session, but a world-class athlete could actually have rattled off 26 miles in half the time it took the Treasury committee to quiz Mark Carney and colleagues. Today\u2019s mega session covered three important issues -- monetary policy, Scottish independence, and the foreign exchange rigging scandal. More of a slow roast than a grilling. But we learned quite a bit - here\u2019s the key points. \u2022 The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has warned allegations that foreign exchange rates were manipulated are \u201cextremely serious\u201d, as he and senior colleague Paul Fisher defend the BoE\u2019s role in the affair. Carney told the Treasury committee: This is extremely serious. As Martin Wheatley [FCA chief] has rightly said this is as serious as Libor if not more so because this goes to the heart of integrity of markets and we have to establish the integrity of markets. Time will tell.\u201d Carney also told MPs that the Bank would issue a report to the G20 over the issue, underlining its importance. Ensuring the probity of the foreign exchange rates is \u201cincredibly important\u201d for the FX market and \u201cfundamentally important\u201d for the credibility of the Bank of England itself, Carney added. \u2022 Carney also revealed that the Bank will appoint a new deputy governor, with responsibility for markets and banking. Their first job is to \u201cconduct a root-and-branch review of how we conduct market intelligence,\u201d he said. \u2022 The Bank\u2019s executive director for markets, Paul Fisher, denied that the Bank had known in 2006 that FX rates were being rigged. Fisher told the committee that eight-year old minutes, released last week, only showed City traders griping that hedge funds were manipulating the daily FX fix -- not that there was collusion between traders to rig it. Fisher argued: It would be very odd for traders to have come to these meetings and said \u2018we\u2019ve been rigging the market, what do you think?\u2019. \u2022 But MPs expressed deep concern over the Bank\u2019s conduct. Andrea Leadsom criticised the BoE for not acting years ago, when concerns were first raised. She suggested it had learned little from previous wrong-doing -- prompting Fisher to reply that it\u2019s not the Bank\u2019s job to look for market rigging. \u2022 MPs also demanded to know why an unnamed Bank staff member was suspended last week, but the line manager -- Paul Fisher himself -- had not been. Carney said there was no reason at this stage to \u201cescalate\u201d the issue, insisting that the staffer suspended was not facing any disciplinary action. That suspension relates to \u201cthe keeping of our rigorous internal control procedures, including around records management and escalation,\u201d he said. \u2022 Carney was asked about reports last weekend that the Bank might appoint a senior external figure to handle its inquiry. The governor said he couldn\u2019t say if this is true, as he\u2019s not on the Bank\u2019s oversight committee, but said he believes it makes to enlist such an outsider to lead the inquiry. \u2022 Carney also revealed that the Bank was first alerted on 16 October that it could have been aware of FX manipulation, and acted swiftly by engaging external lawyers. And on Scotland.... \u2022 Earlier in the session, the governor said there was a \u201cdistinct possibility\u201d that Royal Bank of Scotland would have to move its HQ from Edinburgh if Scotland votes for independence. He also spoke about the importance of fiscal union underpinning successful currency unions, pointing to the eurozone crisis. \u2022 And discussing monetary policy, Mark Carney insisted he had \u2018no regrets\u2019 over his forward guidance that interest rates won\u2019t rise until the economy is stronger. He also suggested UK interest rates could have risen to 2.5% in three years, and said it would not start to unwind its QE bond-buying programme until interest rates had been raised several times. \u2022 The session also exposed difference between MPC members over the size of the UK\u2019s output gap - Carney said it was probably more than 1.5% of GDP, but Martin Weale said it is likely to be under 1%. \u2022 There\u2019s an earlier summary of the first 2 hours of the session. You can see the minutes of those 2006 meetings between the Bank and its Chief Dealers subgroup on the Bank\u2019s website: here. Here\u2019s one crucial paragraph: It was noted that there was evidence of attempts to move the market around popular fixing times by players that had no particular interest in that fix. This was not in the interest of customers if the market was forced away from where it should be when the fixing snapshot was taken. It was noted that \u2018fixing business\u2019 generally was becoming increasingly fraught due to this behaviour. That\u2019s what Andrea Leadsom was citing, when she asked why talk of \u2018efforts to move the market\u2019 didn\u2019t set alarm bells ringing at Threadneedle Street. Andrew Tyrie, who has steered the Treasury Committee since 2010, ends the session by chiding Mark Carney and Paul Fisher over the way the Bank of England has handled the FX scandal. Tyrie said the session (coverage begins here) had exposed that the Bank\u2019s governance structure -- which was meant to be bolstered since the financial crisis - is \u201cstill opaque, complex and byzantine\u201d and must be fixed. It is now facing its first test... and it\u2019s not doing very well, Tyrie concluded. Mark Carney suggested the Bank could perhaps learn from the IMF\u2019s own internal evaluation office. And that is that - after a session that began at 9.29am.... Summary to follow.... Andrew Tyrie puts his finger on one key issue -- the line manager of the Bank of England employee suspended while the FX probe takes place is one Paul Fisher. Has Mr Fisher at all involved in the Bank\u2019s inquiry? Fisher says he is not, and is also not privy to the details of the internal probe - \u201cjust in case\u201d it is escalated to include investigating him. Andrea Leadsom homes in on the key issue -- exactly what was contained in the minutes of meetings between the Bank and FX traders in 2006, that were released last week. Paul Fisher insists that those minutes do NOT show collusion between traders -- only \u2018manipulation\u2019 of rates by people who are not market setters. Leadsom wants to know the difference -- Fisher explains that in 2006, FX traders were complaining that hedge funds were putting large FX orders through the system around the 4pm London fix (when the official daily rate is set). Those large orders would move the market against the dealer -- who could potentially run up losses if the markets move against them. But as Tyrie points out that minutes from 2008 also highlighted concerns that the market could be subject to manipulation. Leadsom is clearly unconvinced by Fisher\u2019s argument -- if the meeting showed signs of manipulation, why on earth didn\u2019t the bank act? Especially once the Libor scandal gave a clear signal of how markets could be manipulated. At this point, Mark Carney steps in to explain the distinction between the complaints in 2006 and 2008, and the allegations that broke in 2013. FX traders want a quiet life, he tells the MPs - and hedge funds putting large orders through the systems messes up their chances of guaranteeing they can deliver the 4pm fix to their clients. Later, Carney says, some appear to have decided to cheat and collude to make their lives easier (and richer, one MP suggests). Carney concludes: That is not acceptable, and has to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Leadsom is concerned that until 2012, the Bank apparently had no clear policy on how staff should escalate evidence of possible misconduct. A great series of questions from Andrea Leadsom MP - who asks why the Bank hasn\u2019t acted on previous warnings of wrong-doing in the City going back many years. She asks how the Bank official who has been suspended should have addressed the signs of wrong doing. Paul Fisher says that \u201cclear evidence\u201d of manipulation should have been escalated. And asked why the Bank hasn\u2019t looked deeply into other markets after the Libor scandal broker, Fisher replied that \u201cit\u2019s not our job to go hunting for the rigging of markets\u201d. Bank of England governor Mark Carney told the Treasury committee that the allegations of foreign exchange rate manipulation is at least as bad as the Libor scandal -- in which traders conspired to fix the interest rates charged between banks. As the FX hearing continues (highlights start here), Carney told MPs that: This is as serious as Libor, if not more so...it goes to the heart of the integrity of the markets, and we have to ensure the integrity of markets. He reiterated that the Bank takes it extremely seriously, and is tackling it in a serious, fair manner. George Mudie MP, though, isn\u2019t impressed -- accusing Carney of acting like his predecessor Sir Mervyn King by passing the buck onto other people; either the \u2018old duffers\u2019 on the Bank\u2019s Court, or to FCA boss Martin Wheatley. The committee are trying to get to the bottom of exactly who is investigating what at the BoE. What is the Bank\u2019s oversight committee investigating? They are examining if any officials were involved in manipulation, or knew about it and didn\u2019t act. Mark Carney insists that the Bank of England takes the issue of foreign exchange rate manipulation extremely seriously. He tells MPs that it is \u201cincredibly important\u201d for the FX market and \u201cfundamentally important\u201d for the credibility of the Bank of England itself. I do not want to leave you with the impression that we\u2019ve done something, and now we\u2019ll relax. We are going to pursue this all the way. We owe it to the public, to parliament, and to our employees - who have acted with professionalism at this time - to address this issue, and we can\u2019t allow any concerns over the integrity of the Bank, Carney concludes. BIG NEWS: The Co-operative Group has confirmed that Euan Sutherland has stepped down as its chief executive. Richard Pennycook, its finance director, has taken temporary control - hours after it emerged that Sutherland had tended his resignation, saying the Group was ungovernable. As covered early in the blog, Sutherland wrote a resignation letter after the Observer reported on Sunday that he was receiving a \u00a33.5m pay package. More on this later.... Carney is reminded that reports of problems in the foreign exchange market surfaced in June 2013 -- why did the Bank do nothing until October? He says there were some discussions with the FCA about the issue. Carney says the allegations came from a \u201ccredible member\u201d of the private sector. The FCA (City watchdog) was involved straight away, he says. And the BoE is working \u201cintensively\u201d with other central banks to make sure the Foreign Exchange market is reformed. David Ruffley MP is seeking details of how the Bank handled its inquiry into its conduct in the FX markets. Carney says that a Bank employee received information about potential foreign exchange rigging on 16 October. The bank acted straight away, hiring legal council [Travers Smith] the same day. The staff member was suspended while the inquiry examines whether they maintained rigorous internal controls and records So why, Ruffley asks, has the suspended staffer\u2019s manager, not been suspended? There\u2019s a long pause...before Carney replies that \u201cescalation\u201d is still an option. Carney is pretty scathing about the conduct of those traders involved in financial wrong-doing, telling the Treasury committe that it is vital to ensure the highest standards of integrity in the City. What we saw with Libor.....is a group of individuals, and it appears with FX too, who have lost sight of what a real market is, Carney says. The Bank of England must lead the efforts to fix this, he adds. Carney says that the Bank\u2019s new strategic review will be published a week today -- and will include a new deputy governor responsible for ensuring markets operate properly. Mark Carney tells MPs that the Bank of England\u2019s senior staff are not protected from the City watchdog. The Financial Conduct Authority, he says, \u201ccan and does\u201d investigate individuals Paul Fisher has denied, robustly, that the Bank of England has known since 2006 that the foreign exchange market might have been unfairly manipulated. The Bank\u2019s executive director for markets insists that the minutes of meetings from 2006, released last week, only showed that chief dealers were concerned that large foreign banks were putting extremely large buy and sell orders through the system, moving the FX rates and making their lives harder. We didn\u2019t learn until these specific allegations of FX rigging until last year, Fisher tells the Treasury committee. As he puts it: It would be very odd for traders to have come to these meetings and said \u2018we\u2019ve been rigging the market, what do you think?\u2019. Fisher is adamant that he would have alerted the authorities if he\u2019s had any suspicions that foreign exchange rates were being manipulated. Carney insists that the Bank has \u201crelentlessly\u201d followed up the allegations of foreign exchange rigging. He also says that he believes it is best to appoint an external person handle the inquiry. Tyrie asks Carney about reports in the weekend newspapers that the Bank is going to appoint a senior independent figure to oversee the inquiry. That\u2019s a decision for the Bank\u2019s oversight committee, Carney replies -- he\u2019s not a member, so he can\u2019t comment on whether the reports are true. Carney outlines how the Bank of England first became aware on 16 October that the investigation into forex manipulation could involve the Bank itself. We acted swiftly, he said, engaging external legal council just 48 hours later. Have any minutes of the Bank\u2019s Court been redacted? Carney says yes -- November\u2019s Court minutes were redacted on the advise of legal council. The issue could still be escalated through the managerial chain, Carney adds. Andrew Tyrie begins by asking why the Bank of England released the name of the person they suspended last week, over its inquiry into possible manipulation of the foreign exchange markets. We didn\u2019t release it, Mark Carney insists (citing the UK\u2019s \u201cvery active press).... And no disciplinary action is underway. Tyrie points out that the release of the name must be very upsetting for the person involved -- who may very well have done nothing wrong at all. Why wasn\u2019t this person\u2019s manager also suspended, he asks Paul Fisher (executive director of the Bank). There was no reason to consider suspending the manager, Fisher adds. And Carney says that the Bank\u2019s governors took the decision to suspend the individual, based on evidence that emerged during the inquiry. And we\u2019re off again! With, finally, the section on the allegations that the foreign exchange market has been manipulated. Andrew Tyrie tries to sum up Carney\u2019s position -- is he saying that rules aren\u2019t enough to ensure the stability of a currency union, you actually need fiscal unity? Carney replies that he believes the eurozone needs to build a degree of fiscal federalism to be viable in the medium term. And does the same thing apply to the issue of Scotland, teases Tyrie: That, the governor replies firmly, is an issue that needs to be analysed, and is being analysed, by the appropriate people. I would prefer not to share my own views, he adds. And that\u2019s the end of Part Two - with Tyrie congratulating Carney on playing a \u201cvery elegant straight bat\u201d. Scotland\u2019s banking sector is 12 times its GDP -- is that remotely sustainable? Carney says that given the way the financial service industry is structured, such a multiple is very risky. Upcoming changes, though, mean a country could support a higher multiple than is safe today, he adds. For comparison -- Cyprus had a banking sector eight times its GDP, before its bailout. Another intriguing exchange, about what commitments the rest of the UK would need in return for agreeing a currency union. Carney says that rUK (in the jargon) would need to see a \u201cfiscal arrangement\u201d, giving a claim on Scottish assets in the event of future liabilities: He points to the eurozone crisis -- the Maastricht Treaty ruled out bailouts, but in the \u201cteeth of a global crisis\u201d it was judged that the risks were too great. Interesting question -- does the Bank of England have a duty to help Scotland with the challenges of independence? Mark Carney replies that the BoE has a \u201cvery high interest\u201d in the financial stability of an independent Scotland (just like the eurozone). We are providing \u201ctechnical assistance and perspective to the interested parties\u201d, he adds. Some reaction to Mark Carney\u2019s comments on Scotland: Andrea Leadsom asks whether an independent Scotland could reassure the Bank of England by applying to join the European Banking Union. Carney replies that this would address some concerns - as Brussels is creating mechanisms to decide how banks are regulated, and how failing banks are wound up. But, it would not create a new Lender of Last Resort -- and being semi-viable isn\u2019t enough. As Carney puts it: It is a bit like being pregnant... You can\u2019t be half viable in a currency union. Now a key question -- does Mark Carney think RBS would have to move its headquarters from Edinburgh to the rest of the UK if Scotland votes for independence, and remained part of the EU? Carney replies: It is a distinct possibility, but I don\u2019t want to prejudge.... He adds that an independent Scotland would also have to hold higher foreign exchange reserves if the financial markets thought that any sterling union was only temporary -- which would put pressure on Edinburgh to run a budget surplus. Carney keeps repeating that he isn\u2019t a lawyer, but he does sound more negative about the issue than when he gave his speech on the issue in late January. David Ruffley is now probing about whether Scottish banks would need to move out of an independent Scotland. Mark Carney says that it is \u201cnot clear\u201d that banks would keep their HQs in Scotland -- given the high-value operations in the rest of the UK (ie, the City). What would the Prudential Regulation Authority do about the issue? Carney says that a crucial factor is whether Scotland remains a member of the EEA (the European Economic Area). If it does, then the PRS is limited in its ability to adjust. Would you act as Lender of Last Resort for Lloyds and RBS if Scotland chose to use sterling without joining a currency union? Carney says that the Bank would have to take a decision, based on where the banks\u2019 chose to domicile themselves, their capital position, and other measures the Scottish government might take. He adds that the Bank is \u201cconscious\u201d that acting as a lender of last resort to banks outside the UK does expose the UK balance sheet to potential losses. Now David Ruffley, Conservative MP, asks how a Yes vote could affect the way the Bank of England worked with banks based in an independent Scotland. Carney says the Bank would have to evaluate financial firms domiciled in Scotland over whether to continue acting as a settlement agent for those banks, but suggests it would probably keep settling those accounts. Under European law, he says, there needs to be a decision over where a bank is domiciled. And an independent Scotland would need to guarantee the deposits of Scottish-domiciled banks that are held in England. Has the Financial Policy Committee, the part of the Bank charged with maintaining financial stability, conducted any work on the possible threat posed by Scottish independence, asks chairman Andrew Tyrie? Carney says it has not. Tyrie wants to know why not Carney says it is not on list of risk the FPC must take account of, and there is a period of time when arrangements could be discussed (if Scotland votes for independence). Tyrie points out that this risk is coming down the line pretty fast (with a vote scheduled for September this year) Carney assures the committee that the Bank of England isn\u2019t being negligent -- if there was actually a change to monetary conditions in the UK we would offer clear advice, he says. Carney says the Bank has not done any thinking on how many seats an independent Scotland would get on the MPC, in the event that it joins a currency union. Liberal Democrat MP John Thurso is next, and tries to expose the flaws in Scottish independence (he represents the Scottish constituency of Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross). Scotland is a small country, he says, would its economy be more volatile if it were independent? Mark Carney says that Scotland\u2019s economy suffers when energy prices fall, but at present this impact is cushioned because the wider economic weakness triggers more \u2018transfer payments\u2019 (welfare payments) to Scotland. Are small countries more volatile, asks Thurso, citing Portugal and Iceland (both hit hard by the financial crisis). Carney pauses, thinks, and says he hesitates to come to such a conclusion. Stewart Hosie, the Scottish Nationalist Party\u2019s MP on the committee, asks Mark Carney to explain what rules makes a successful currency union. Carney says it all depends on the nature of the countries involved. Hosie follows up, pointing out that output growth in Scotland is highly correlated with the rest of the UK -- so is being highly correlated beneficial to creating a successful currency union? A high correlation of output growth is \u201cbeneficial for successful monetary policy\u201d, Carney replies. Carney repeats that he is only taking a \u2018technocratic\u2019 view of the pros and cons of independent Scotland. Ultimately, it is a decision for Scotland. The committee are back, and so is Mark Carney (David Miles and Martin Weale have been released for the day, while Paul Fisher is on a tighter leash and must return to his seat when the committee move onto the forex inquiry). This session is on Scotland independence. Reminder, it is being streamed live here. A quick summary of the key points, as the committee takes a quick break. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has told the Treasury committee that it\u2019s \u2018not unreasonable\u2019 to think that UK interest rates could hit 2.5% within three years. Carney said that some struggling firms will fail as interest rates rise -- which would help to improve productivity in the UK. The BoE\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee is split over the size of the UK output gap. Carney says it is probably more than 1.5% of the UK economy - but Martin Weale says it is under 1%. Carney also revealed he failed to persuade the rest of the MPC to publish an official estimate of the output gap.... ...and said the Bank is concerned that mortgage underwriting standards could drop. Bank officials have denied that they could drive up UK borrowing costs when they start to unwind QE. The Bank will announce details of its new strategic review next week -- including new funding for its forecasting arm. And it has revealed that it destroys the recordings of the monthly meetings of the MPC -- to the clear concern of committee chairman Andrew Tyrie The era of falling real wages could soon be over, suggests David Miles, who tells MPs: \u201cI think we\u2019re getting to the point at which average wage settlements are moving above the rate of inflation.\u201d How worried is the Bank of England about the UK recovery, which it described as \u2018fragile\u2019 last month? Carney points to business investment -- if that doesn\u2019t pick up, then the recovery could disappoint, he says. The risks are to the downside with business investment, he adds. Andrew Tyrie MP asks what happens to the records of the Bank of England\u2019s monthly monetary policy committee? Paul Fisher, executive director for markets, explains that a recording is taken to allow the Minutes to be written, and that recording is later destroyed. Tyrie is most unimpressed -- the recording could have real historical value, he says, pointing out that the US Federal Reserve released transcripts of its own meetings in 2008. Why is the Bank of England not keeping its own records, he demands? Fisher replies that it can be very hard to distinguish exactly what is being said during the meetings. And the minutes give a true impression of what went on* Tyrie hits back, asking if the MPC members are shouting and banging the table. Fisher explains that a \u2018free flowing\u2019 discussion doesn\u2019t lend itself well to a transcript, and MPC members might not speak freely otherwise. Tyrie urges the committee to give serious consideration to keeping the recordings, and (devilishly) suggests Mark Carney should chair the MPC in a way that means the members can be clearly heard. Carney laughs, in a way that suggests he\u2019s not particularly amused. * - and without the recordings, we\u2019ll have to take his word for it Sky News\u2019s economics editor, Ed Conway, is aghast: Carney also suggests that the Bank\u2019s balance sheet - swelled by its gorging of gilts -- will not return to its pre-crisis level: A long discussion about the intricacies of quantitative easing... with Carney assuring MPs that the Bank has an indemnity against possible losses on its bond-buying programme. It ends with Andrew Tyrie MP asking whether the Bank plans to sell all the \u00a3375bn of gilts on its books. Carney explains that new capital rules means commercial banks will need to hold more assets such as gilts (meaning, I think, that there shouldn\u2019t be a lack of willing buyers) David Miles is confidence that things are looking up in the UK economy -- telling MPs that he is seeing more optimism among small and medium-sized firms than at any time since he joined the MPC [in June 2009, I think]. Back in the Thatcher Room (livestream here), Labour MP John Mann has challenged the Bank of England governor over his comments that there will be more recycling of capital and jobs when rates rise (see here). Does that just mean more recycling from the north of the UK to the south? Carney says he was speaking in more general terms, and also denies that the looming UK general election (inked in for May 2015) will affect his vote on when to raise rates, or anyone else on the MPC either. Breaking away from the Treasury committee briefly, one of Britain\u2019s most powerful union leaders has died this morning. Bob Crow, the leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, passed away in the early hours of this morning at the age of 52 - shocking the worlds of unions and politics alike. The London mayor, Boris Johnson, and his predecessor Ken Livingstone have both paid tribute to Crow - famous for industrial disputes and campaigns that delivered pay rises for his members, and occasion disruption to London\u2019s transport links. The Bank of England will announce plans to beef up its economic forecasting division next week. Asked about the Bank\u2019s (somewhat ropey) track record on economic forecasting, Carney says that the Bank will publish the results of its strategic review next week. That will include new resources for its forecasting division -- which has been criticised for failing to predict inflation through the crisis, the depth of the last recession, or the recent recovery in the jobs market. Carney says forecasting is: Something we have to constantly get better at. The Bank needs to ask why it made mistakes*, and explain how it is learning from them, he adds. * - speaking of which, the photo in the last entry is ANDREA Leadsom MP. Mark Carney says that the Bank of England won\u2019t consult the Treasury before taking the decision to unwind its \u00a3375bn bond-buying programme. He tells the committee that the BoE is likely to consult the Debt Management Office (which sells the debt to fund the UK deficit) over the timing. But the chancellor of the day will not get a say, he suggests. My view is that it\u2019s a monetary policy decision, Carney says - it\u2019s clearly been delegated to the MPC. Andrea Leadsom MP homes in on the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme -- when will it start to sell the \u00a3375bn of UK debt it bought during the crisis, and how much will that push up borrowing costs? David Miles suggests that unwinding QE will have little impact, citing academic research that says it could have \u2018zero\u2019 impact in a market that is operating at full efficiency. Leadsom\u2019s not impressed -- dumping \u00a3375bn of gilts is only going to move the yield curve one way, she insists. Carney agrees that selling the bonds bought under QE will indeed have an effect, which is why it will take place gradually and in consultation with the BoE\u2019s Financial Policy Committee. He also says that the Bank will probably have raised interest rates several times before starting to unwinds QE. David Miles, another external member of the MPC, admits that he\u2019s a bit baffled by the difference between the amount of \u2018slack\u2019 in the UK economy, and the \u2018output gap\u2019 (see 9.45am for the early exchange). Cue much handwaving by both Miles and Carney: Carney then reveals that he would personally like to publish a measure of the output gap, but he couldn\u2019t persuade the rest of the MPC. Andrew Tyrie asks Carney whether the Bank will regularly issue its own estimate of the output gap in the UK economy, to give a better insight into its forward guidance. There are no plans at present, the governor replies. Mark Carney has told the Treasury committee that it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that UK interest rates could rise to 2% to 2.5% over the next three years, in a \u2018gradual\u2019 manner. He told the Treasury committee that deputy governor Charlie Bean had spoken sensibly about this subject yesterday: Some members of the MPC have put more precise figures on the extent to which interest rates would be expected to rise over the three-year horizon. Charlie Bean yesterday referenced 2.5 percentage points. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an unreasonable sense to get across - a 2-2.5 percent bank rate over the course of the forecast horizon.\u201d Is Mark Carney suggesting that the improvements in the UK economy are all down to his stewardship of the Bank of England? The governor replies that monetary policy is one reason that the economy has improved. Carney is having to defend his new forward guidance, with the committee suggesting that the Bank\u2019s credibility has been hurt by the decision to change the policy after just six months. Are the new 18 economic indicators that the Bank of England will now consider when deciding when to raise interest rates just a way to create \u2018wriggle room\u2019? Looking a little irked, Carney shoots back that there has been a dramatic improvement in the UK economy since last summer - unemployment has dropped sharply, and the UK economy is growing faster than most of the developed world. Stepping back a bit - here\u2019s Carney\u2019s comments about house prices, and the concern that people could become overstretched (via Reuters) Underwriting standards at present of mortgage providers are quite high... \u201dOur concern is that those underwriting standards will deteriorate and that that deterioration itself would be fed by general improvement in the housing market.\u201d The committee is concerned about struggling firms who might go bust when interest rates go up, because they can\u2019t repay their debts. Mark Garnier MP asks what work the Bank has done on this - how many firms are effectively on life-support and will go under once borrowing costs return to normality (known as \u201cforbearance\u201d) Mark Carney replies that fewer firms collapsed in the last recession because the Bank acted quickly to loosen monetary policy so quickly. That may have hampered productivity, because less capital was recycled and fewer people were laid off and then rehired in more productive jobs. The recovery should bring some \u201cnormalisation of interest rates\u201d, and reduce forbearance (as firms who are only viable in a low interest rate environment go to the wall) . That will bring some pain, but it should increase productivity, Carney says. Carney says the Bank is developing \u2018affordability tools\u2019 to avoid households being given mortgages beyond their means, but cannot influence some of the factors driving up house prices in the UK capital. Onto the housing market -- does Mark Carney think rising house prices are a good thing? It all depends what is pushing prices up, he replies. If it\u2019s because incomes are rising, then that\u2019s a good sign for the economy. But if they\u2019re being driven up by \u201cextrapolative expectations\u201d (ie, because people think prices will keep rising) then a bubble may be forming, and that\u2019s clearly bad. The latter case could put \u201ca large number of households in a vulnerable position\u201d that takes a long time to recover from, he cautions. An early difference of views -- Mark Carney suggests there is more than 1.5% of spare capacity in the UK economy (as estimated by the Bank\u2019s own economists). .. but Martin Weale, an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee, suggests there is less than 1%. Weale is explaining that he believes official measures can suggest the output gap is bigger than it really is, as new entrants are typically paid less than established workers (making wages a poor measure of output). Weale opposed Carney\u2019s forward guidance back in August -- and doesn\u2019t think that was a poor call. As expected, the session begins with the Committee asking about monetary policy (we may not get to the Forex rigging allegations until noon) Chairman Andrew Tyrie asks Mark Carney why he changed his forward guidance on interest rates last month - dropping the 7% jobless rate target (unveiled last summer) in favour of a broader target based around the output gap. Could a really alert chap in August have guessed that you\u2019d have changed your focus in February, asks Tyrie. A really alert chap could have suspected that we\u2019d focus on spare capacity in the economy, Carney replies. So how big is the output gap in the UK economy? Carney says the gap is \u2018dominant\u2019 in the labour market, saying that the \u2018equilibrium\u2019 rate for unemployment is around 6%, compare to 7.2% at present. There\u2019s also spare capacity in firms, as well as in the labour market, he adds. Reminder - the agenda is here. THE HEARING IS UNDERWAY - LIVE STREAM HERE Andrea Leadsom MP, a member of the Treasury Committee, says today\u2019s hearing (in a few minutes time) will focus on the question of exactly what the Bank of England knew about allegations of rigging in the forex market. She points to the minutes released last week which appear to show that chief currency dealers were raising the possibility of collusion when meeting Bank officials as far back as 2006. Yet, it appears that that Bank \u201cdid nothing\u201d. If this was indeed allowed to take place over many years, and the bank didn\u2019t do anything to stop it, it would strengthen the case for a proper supervisory board to oversee the Bank of England, Leadsom said. That is unlikely to go down well with Threadneedle Street, where the BoE is currently watched over by its own Court of Directors (including Carney and the deputy governors). Leadsom was speaking on the Today programme. Brenda Kelly of IG explained that there is no central body that sets currency rates -- instead, the \u20184pm London fix\u2019 is taken as that day\u2019s official FX rate. So, in theory, a large bank could flood the market with orders around that time to influence that day\u2019s reading. Here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s first take on the latest drama at the Co-op: Co-operative Group chief executive Euan Sutherland offers to resign Labour and Co-operative MP Meg Hillier MP isn\u2019t impressed that Euan Sutherland has threatened to resign from the Co-operative Group. She just told the Today Programme that she is \u201cpretty shocked\u201d by the news that the Co-op CEO had tendered his resignation, and doesn\u2019t have much sympathy for him either. If Sutherland believes he is worth the \u00a33.6m pay package being drawn up then he should explain why, Hillier said. If he\u2019s embarrassed by it, he shouldn\u2019t take it. Hillier added that pay packages that are common in the PLC arena are not acceptable in the Co-operative world - Sutherland should accept that he\u2019s \u201cswimming in different waters\u201d. Today presenter Evan Davis suggested, though, that Sutherland has a right to be paid the going rate for turning around the Group. As he put it: There\u2019s no point having a Co-operative movement that goes bust. The chief executive of the Co-operative Group, Euan Sutherland, has threatened to quit. City editor Jill Treanor reports that Sutherland has said the Group is simply too hard to manage, as the row over his efforts to reshape the organisation, and plans to hike his pay, deepens. She writes: The Co-operative Group was thrown deeper into crisis on Tuesday after the new boss Euan Sutherland threatened to resign in the face of opposition to his reforms for the mutually-owned chain of supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies. The Group board convened a late night telephone conference call to agree to recommend changes to its management structure to give Sutherland a seat on the board in a more conventional style for a major company. Sutherland offered to resign in a letter to the chair Ursula Lidbetter -herself promoted once the bank\u2019s problems were exposed \u2013 on a point of principle that the Group was too difficult to govern. The threat comes two days after The Observer reported that Co-op was planning to pay Sutherland more than \u00a33.5m, and massively boost the salaries and bonuses of other senior staff. Jill explains: Sutherland threatened to quit after using Facebook to criticise leaks of his \u00a33.6m pay deal to The Observer last weekend. Sutherland, who took the helm on May 1 after leaving Kingfisher\u2019s B&amp;Q, said on the group\u2019s Facebook page that \u201can individual or individuals\u201d were determined to undermine him. BBC economics editor Robert Peston has also been reporting the story on the Today programme. Here\u2019s some reaction: Treasury Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie has already fired a warning shot at the Bank of England. He said last week that the Central Bank had been too slow to act when allegations of forex market-rigging came to light: \u201cLed by the Chairman of Court, there is a strong case that the non executives in the Bank should have taken the initiative on this from the moment the need for external assistance was considered. That was last October, possibly earlier. Yet this issue does not appear to have been raised with Court or the Oversight Committee \u2013 the nearest the Bank has to a board \u2013 until December. Indeed, it appears to have taken the suspension of a Bank employee for the Oversight Committee to be fully engaged.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and business. What exactly did the Bank of England know about the possible rigging of the foreign exchange markets? And why didn\u2019t it act faster when allegations first surfaced that traders had conspired to fix the official forex rates? These question will be on the lips of the Treasury Committee this morning, when they tackle governor Mark Carney over the latest scandal to rock the City. The committee will also be quizzing Carney and colleagues over the latest inflation report, and the monetary implications of Scottish independence, in what looks like a mammoth session. The Bank of England has been dragged deep into the Forex row this month, amid speculation that its own officials had condoned the manipulation of foreign exchange prices. The Bank suspending an employee last week, and released details of minutes held with foreign exchange traders over many years. They showed that the possibility that the market was fixed could have been discussed as long ago as 2006. Carney, who only joined the Bank last July, should expect to be challenged over his efforts to modernise the Bank. As we wrote yesterday: Carney will be under pressure to explain to Andrew Tyrie, the committee\u2019s chairman, why it took the Bank so long to act after allegations in October against two of its officials. Last week, Tyrie said the Bank needed \u201ca board worthy of the name\u201d, adding that the revelations had exposed a \u201cbyzantine\u201d governance structure. Andrew Love, a committee member said: \u201cWe will be asking the governor what steps he is taking to bring management arrangements and committee structure up to the standards of the 21st century.\u201d Here\u2019s the Committee\u2019s agenda: At 9.30 am: Dr Mark Carney, Governor, Bank of England Paul Fisher, Executive Director, Markets, Bank of England Professor David Miles, Member, Monetary Policy Committee, Bank of England Dr Martin Weale, Member, Monetary Policy Committee, Bank of England At 11.00am (approx) Subject: Governor of the Bank of England\u2019s speech \u2018Economics of currency unions\u2019, Edinburgh, 29 January 2014 Witness: Dr Mark Carney, Governor, Bank of England At 12.00 (approx) Subject: Foreign Exchange Market Review Witnesses: Dr Mark Carney, Governor, Bank of England Paul Fisher, Executive Director, Markets, Bank of England I\u2019ll be tracking the session, along with other news through the day.

      "bodyText": "Britain's recovery will be the strongest among G7 economies over the first half of 2014, according to the latest predictions from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The UK economy is forecast to grow over the six months at a speed that would give an annual growth rate of 3.3%, outpacing the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. On a quarterly basis, that would equate to growth of about 0.8% in both the first and second quarters \u2013 an acceleration from the 0.7% growth in the fourth quarter of 2013. Separate data from the Office for National Statistics showed that Britain's manufacturers did not allow torrential rain and flooding to derail their recovery in January, with factory output up 0.4% on a monthly basis. It was slightly stronger than the 0.3% forecast by economists, and in line with December's rise. But the broader measure of industrial production managed growth of just 0.1% in January, dragged down by a sharp 5.8% fall in oil and gas extraction as the severe weather hampered North Sea production. On an annual basis, manufacturing output increased by 3.3%, the strongest rate in almost three years. \"The troubles in Ukraine, emerging market wobbles or, more parochially, the weather, are not likely to derail this recovery, which should continue and possibly strengthen,\" said Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated that the UK economy grew by 0.8% in the three months to February and said GDP should rise above its pre-crisis peak later this year \u2013 it reached \u00a3392.7bn at the beginning of 2008. The British Chambers of Commerce also forecast this week that GDP would narrowly surpass that record in the three months to July. Turning to the broader global recovery, the OECD said volatility in emerging markets was expected to hold back global growth in the short term. \"Given that emerging economies now account for more than half the world economy, continued sub-par economic performance for several of the major emerging market economies is likely to mean that global growth remains only moderate in the near term,\" the OECD said in its interim economic assessment report. The Paris-based organisation is forecasting a 2.2% annual rate of growth in the G7 overall in the first quarter, followed by 2% in the second. It supported the scaling-back of the US Federal Reserve's bond-buying programme, but said the Fed should \"proceed cautiously\" with the tapering of stimulus because of the negative impact it was having on currencies and bond and equities prices in some emerging economies. \"The underlying picture continues to be of strengthening growth momentum in the major advanced economies,\" it said, citing the UK, the US and Japan as countries with an improved outlook. \"While activity in the euro area appears to be improving, so far it is doing so later and at a slower pace than in the other major economies. Notably, while unemployment has been falling elsewhere, it has remained flat at stubbornly high levels in the euro area.\" The OECD said that in Japan \"the first year of Abenomics yielded a welcome rebound in GDP\" \u2013 referring to the boost from policies introduced by Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister. It cautioned, however, that the \"necessary fiscal consolidation\", which gets under way later this year in the country, would act as a drag on growth in the short term. That, as well as the disruption caused by severe winter weather in the US, was expected to weigh on growth in advanced economies in the short term. \"The projections suggest that growth for the major advanced economies in the first half of 2014 will be somewhat slower than in the second half of 2013, but much improved from the sluggish rates of late 2012 and early 2013,\" the OECD said. The US is expected to grow at an annual rate of 1.7% in the first quarter, followed by 3.1% in the second. The international forecaster said that while some of the risks to the global economy had waned since its last assessment, in November \u2013 including political wrangling over the US debt ceiling \u2013 others remained. \"Japan is only just beginning to confront its daunting fiscal challenges, fragilities in the euro area are still acute, and the possibility persists of a sharp slowdown in China driven by balance sheet effects.\"",

      "standfirst": "Merrill Lynch says company could boost its consumer health business with acquisitions", 
      "body": "<p><strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong>, owner of Durex, this week bought lubricant brand K-Y from Johnson &amp; Johnson, but could more acquisitions be on the horizon?</p> <p>Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch think there is a good chance of this, and estimate the company could have up to \u00a312bn of firepower at its disposal, perhaps more with the \u00a33bn or so of proceeds from any sale of its pharmaceuticals business, whose future is currently under review. In a buy note with a \u00a356 a share price target, Merrill analyst Pinar Ergun said:</p> <blockquote> Reckitt's focus on Health and Hygiene (70% ex-pharmaceutical sales) presents significant earnings upside. These divisions have averaged 7% organic sales growth since 2011, as the categories exhibit structurally faster growth &amp; higher profitability versus traditional health and personal care. We see an increasing likelihood of transformational deals in Health and disposals of laggard businesses in Portfolio/Home in the next 12-18 months...which should significantly improve Reckitt's long-term earnings power. We also see further upside from the pharmaceutical review and a recovery in Europe/US, where Reckitt is outperforming peers. </blockquote> <p>Merrill said the fragmented consumer health market was rich with consolidation opportunities:</p> <blockquote> In our view, Reckits's clear Health strategy, solid balance sheet and chief executive comments that Reckitt will be a 'consolidator' in the space raises the likelihood of deals. Management has an excellent M&amp;A track record with swift integration/synergy extraction, leading to high returns and meaningful earnings per share accretion post deals. <br> </blockquote> <p>So what could Reckitt buy? Merrill says:</p> <blockquote> Press has speculated that Reckitt could be a \"logical buyer\" of Merck's consumer health unit...we agree. Reckitt could become a top three consumer health company globally, with $2bn in acquired sales and a good portfolio overlap.

      "bodyText": "Reckitt Benckiser, owner of Durex, this week bought lubricant brand K-Y from Johnson &amp; Johnson, but could more acquisitions be on the horizon? Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch think there is a good chance of this, and estimate the company could have up to \u00a312bn of firepower at its disposal, perhaps more with the \u00a33bn or so of proceeds from any sale of its pharmaceuticals business, whose future is currently under review. In a buy note with a \u00a356 a share price target, Merrill analyst Pinar Ergun said: Reckitt's focus on Health and Hygiene (70% ex-pharmaceutical sales) presents significant earnings upside. These divisions have averaged 7% organic sales growth since 2011, as the categories exhibit structurally faster growth &amp; higher profitability versus traditional health and personal care. We see an increasing likelihood of transformational deals in Health and disposals of laggard businesses in Portfolio/Home in the next 12-18 months...which should significantly improve Reckitt's long-term earnings power. We also see further upside from the pharmaceutical review and a recovery in Europe/US, where Reckitt is outperforming peers. Merrill said the fragmented consumer health market was rich with consolidation opportunities: In our view, Reckits's clear Health strategy, solid balance sheet and chief executive comments that Reckitt will be a 'consolidator' in the space raises the likelihood of deals. Management has an excellent M&amp;A track record with swift integration/synergy extraction, leading to high returns and meaningful earnings per share accretion post deals. So what could Reckitt buy? Merrill says: Press has speculated that Reckitt could be a \"logical buyer\" of Merck's consumer health unit...we agree. Reckitt could become a top three consumer health company globally, with $2bn in acquired sales and a good portfolio overlap. Share of Health in ex-pharmaceuticals sales could jump from 29% to 38%. But that's only one of Reckitt's many options. There is a wealth of consumer health businesses/brands that would fit Reckitt's Health portfolio well (acquisition of K-Y brands from J&amp;J yesterday is a good example).

      "bodyText": "Tesco's share of the UK grocery market has shrunk to its lowest level in almost a decade as British shoppers defected to German discount chains Aldi and Lidl to save money. The latest data from Kantar Worldpanel shows Tesco's market share dropped to 28.7% in the 12 weeks to 2 March. That compares with 29.6% a year ago and turns back the clock to late 2004 when the retailer was in the ascendant. At its peak, in October 2007, Tesco's share hit 31.8%. The \"big four\" supermarket chains are facing unprecedented pressure as the grocery market polarises with the discounters stealing sales at the value end while Waitrose cleans up at the top. \"Over the past three years Waitrose, Aldi and Lidl have taken a combined 3.5 share points from the competition which equates to \u00a34.4bn (in sales) per year,\" said Kantar Worldpanel director Chris Longbottom. \"This has put pressure on the big four supermarkets to compete for a shrinking middle ground and cut prices to directly combat the discounters.\" Tesco not only lost market share but, like struggling rival Morrisons, it also experienced falling sales in a market that grew at 2.2%. Tesco's sales were down 0.6% while the picture was even bleaker at Morrisons which recorded a 3.2% slump. Its market share fell to 11.1%, down from 11.8% a year ago. By comparison Aldi steamed ahead, posting sales growth of 33.5% and taking its market share a full percentage point higher than in the same period last year. Among the big four, Sainsbury's was the only retailer to hold its market share year-on-year at 17%. Waitrose is at a record of 5%. The overall market growth was a step down from last month's 2.4%, which was already the smallest rise since mid-2005. Falling inflation was the main contributing factor with the Kantar Worldpanel measure now standing at 1.9% \u2013 the lowest since July 2010. The market share attrition ratchets up the pressure on Tesco and Morrisons bosses Philip Clarke and Dalton Philips. Last month Clarke told the City he had accelerated the turnaround plan for the Tesco with more store refurbishments in prospect and a \u00a3200m price cuts initiative focused on staple groceries. Philips is due to report Morrisons' full year results on Thursday and analysts anticipate he too will announce a raft of promotions to repel the discounters.",

It has been doing things its way for 150 years and the arrival of a cadre of quoted-company executives was bound to put a few noses out of joint. The challenge was to cajole and persuade recalcitrants in the boardroom and on various committees and subcommittees that reform was in the best interests of the group. Throwing in the towel would be understandable if a set of governance reforms had been proposed and rejected by the members. But the Co-op hadn't yet reached that point. The debate was still running and Sutherland had influential allies in group chair Ursula Lidbetter, who appealed for his resignation to be \"a catalyst for the real and necessary change which the group must go through\", and Lord Myners, who recently arrived as a much-needed outside voice in the boardroom. Sutherland's parting description of the Co-op as \"ungovernable\" was over-the-top. The Co-op is a business with deep problems, a long history of underperformance, an outdated board structure and far too much debt, but Sutherland was hardly trying to bring peace to Afghanistan. He should have stayed long enough to see whether members, when pushed, would adopt \"professional and commercial governance\", as he put it. By resigning, Sutherland leaves the impression that he can't take a bit of heat over his pay. Again, what did he expect? The idea that the boss of the Co-op, in its current state, could collect \u00a33.6m in his first year and \u00a33m in his second will strike many people as preposterous. Even the boss of a company the size of Tesco would struggle to command those sums on a guaranteed basis. Yes, it's not pleasant to have your pay details leaked to the Observer in advance of a big strategic presentation. But all the pay arrangements should have been published on day one, which is how grownup companies behave: transparency at the outset saves hassle later, especially when you are trying to gather support from the shop floor. The board, rather than Sutherland, is probably responsible for that specific failure. But his trouble over pay looks gentle when compared to what Stephen Hester, say, had to deal with at the Royal Bank of Scotland. Hester had a prime minister capable of performing a U-turn on bonuses if opinion polls shifted. Sutherland needed to apply common sense on pay and be less thin-skinned. Grumbling on Facebook about \"disaffected people\" was not sensible. His departure won't look so damaging for the Co-op in a week or two.

Analyst Fahad Changazi said:</p> <blockquote> Aviva reported strong results... with the highlight being a significant reduction in the internal loan to \u00a34.1bn (first half of 2013 \u00a35.1bn), with plans to reduce this to \u00a32.2bn by end 2015.

      "bodyText": "As markets drift lower again, Aviva is bucking the trend after a couple of positive City comments. Nomura has issued a buy note following the insurer's figures last week, saying Aviva was the key restructuring story in the UK sector. Analyst Fahad Changazi said: Aviva reported strong results... with the highlight being a significant reduction in the internal loan to \u00a34.1bn (first half of 2013 \u00a35.1bn), with plans to reduce this to \u00a32.2bn by end 2015. This had been a legacy issue weighing on the shares, and improvement here bodes well for the risk perception of the stock, in our view. In addition, there were also markedly higher cash remittances to group (remittance ratio 72% versus 49% in 2012), and we expect Aviva to reach its [target of] more than 80% in 2014; this is gives us greater confidence in our above-consensus dividend forecasts (+13% and +23% in 2014 and 2015, respectively).

Meanwhile RBC moved its recommendation from underperform to sector perform and raised its price target from 400p to 550p. It said: A return to top-line life growth and a relentless drive to improve efficiency by an impressive management team lead us to increase our target price and upgrade to sector perform.

      "bodyText": "Foxtons has announced a special dividend alongside its first annual results as a public company after the roaring property market sent profit up more than half at the London-focused estate agent. The group said it would pay a total of \u00a315.4m to shareholders, made up of a final regular dividend of 1.70p a share and 3.74p a share in special dividends. Profit before tax jumped 57% to \u00a339m from revenue up 16% to \u00a3139m in the year to 31 December. Sales volumes were up 23% and lettings volumes rose 6.7%. Foxtons is known for its fleet of branded Minis, cafe-style branches in upmarket areas and aggressive sales tactics. Its founder Jon Hunt sold the company to private equity firm BC Partners for about \u00a3360m in 2007 two months before the financial crisis. Foxtons had big debts and struggled to survive but, helped by the resurgent property market, it floated on the stock exchange last year in a deal valuing it at \u00a3649m. Michael Brown, Foxtons' chief executive, said in a statement: \"It's a pleasure for me to report a strong start to Foxtons life as a public company. Our successful IPO in September 2013 leaves the group debt free. We have a clear strategy and a great team dedicated to our overriding objective of delivering profitable growth by expanding our business model throughout the higher value, higher volume London property market. \"We have seen a good start to 2014 with a strong short term sales pipeline. We expect the availability of housing stock for sale to be a key determinant of the level of growth in property sales transactions during the remainder of the year.\" Brown said Foxtons had outperformed the wider property sales market and increased average sale prices by \u00a318,000 to \u00a3493,000 by concentrating on mid-market London property. Foxtons is the latest property-related company to make bumper payments to shareholders from the booming housing market. Taylor Wimpey announced a special dividend and fellow housebuilder Persimmon said it would return cash more quickly than expected to shareholders after the government's Help to Buy scheme increased profits. Foxtons said in its results statement that the risk was increasing of the government changing policy or laws that reduce business volumes or increase costs. Foxtons shares rose 1.1% to 378.5p in early trading.",

The privacy commissioner and the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) have handed down their reports into Telstra\u2019s data breach last year when the personal details of 15,775, including 1,257 people with silent numbers, were published online. Telstra paid a fine of $10,200 for the breach and was ordered to have its practice independently audited. As well as exposing the details of thousands of people, the telecommunication company failed to destroy or de-identify information that was not being used, according to privacy commissioner Timothy Pilgrim. \u201cTelstra was unable to initially determine the purpose of the compromised data and subsequently stated that it was retained in accordance with its document retention policy,\u201d the report said. \u201cHowever Telstra did not identify any particular provisions in the document retention policy that required the source files to be retained on the platform.\u201d The report found: \u201cTelstra did not demonstrate that in this instance it had systems in place to identify personal information that was not being used or disclosed for a purpose \u2026 further, the commissioner did not consider any of the information provided by Telstra to indicate that Telstra had adequate processes in place to destroy or de-identify information that was no longer in use.\u201d The data was from 2009 and before and Telstra told the commissioner there was no immediate commercial need for it. \u201cThe Commissioner noted that information that is not current may still cause harm in the event that it is compromised, for example, it may be used for identity theft purposes,\u201d the report said. Telstra failed to take reasonable steps to ensure the security of the personal information it held; failed to take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify the personal information it held and failed in not disclosing personal information other than for a permitted purpose, the report found. The data breach came to light after someone contacted a journalist with the information, who in turn contacted Telstra and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. It was available online for 15 months and accessible through Google for about 11 months with 166 individual downloads of the document. The information was accidentally originally published by a third party provider as part of a data breach of more than 70,000 people in 2011. As part of the solution to fix the 2011 data breach a third party provider turned off access control on the files making them publicly available. The reports found Telstra took immediate action to rectify its 2013 data breach and Telstra has agreed to the commissioner\u2019s request it had a third party audit the company\u2019s privacy related practices.",

      "body": "<p>Ethical cosmetic company The Body Shop is selling its products in Chinese airports, leaving them open to the risk of animal testing by Chinese authorities, according to a new investigation by the Australian consumer watchdog Choice.</p> <p>While animal testing of cosmetics is still allowed in most countries, China is the only country that actually requires it. Because of this a number of companies have refused to sell their products in China, despite the lure of the $32bn market.</p> <p>Despite The Body Shop saying <a href=\"http://www.thebodyshop.com.hk/en/faqs_china.aspx\">it does not operate in mainland China</a>, for at least the past year Body Shop products have been on sale in at least two Chinese airports, according to Choice. A representative of The Body Shop Australia confirmed to Guardian Australia the company does now sell in Chinese airports.</p> <p>Duty-free cosmetics in China are free from the mandatory pre-market animal testing regulation, but they are subject to random spot tests by Chinese authorities after they hit the shelves.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a standard part of the Chinese cosmetic regulation process,\u201d Choice\u2019s chief executive, Alan Kirkland, told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cChinese officials have said to us there is no way that a product sold in airports could be guaranteed to be exempt from that. There is no way they can guarantee those products are not tested on animals.\u201d</p> <p>There are two types of post-market testing, Choice spokeswoman and investigator Zoya Sheftalovich told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>In one, the China Food and Drug Association takes samples from products on the shelves within six months of registration and tests them on animals to make sure they comply with regulations, Sheftalovich said. </p> <p>\u201cThe second type of post-market testing, which is the type that can happen in airports, is when they just go in and randomly take products of the shelves and test them for various things,\u201d she said, adding that this was the testing The Body Shop would be subjected to.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of how they\u2019re actually conducting the testing [that] is a question for the authorities themselves.

      "bodyText": "Ethical cosmetic company The Body Shop is selling its products in Chinese airports, leaving them open to the risk of animal testing by Chinese authorities, according to a new investigation by the Australian consumer watchdog Choice. While animal testing of cosmetics is still allowed in most countries, China is the only country that actually requires it. Because of this a number of companies have refused to sell their products in China, despite the lure of the $32bn market. Despite The Body Shop saying it does not operate in mainland China, for at least the past year Body Shop products have been on sale in at least two Chinese airports, according to Choice. A representative of The Body Shop Australia confirmed to Guardian Australia the company does now sell in Chinese airports. Duty-free cosmetics in China are free from the mandatory pre-market animal testing regulation, but they are subject to random spot tests by Chinese authorities after they hit the shelves. \u201cIt\u2019s a standard part of the Chinese cosmetic regulation process,\u201d Choice\u2019s chief executive, Alan Kirkland, told Guardian Australia. \u201cChinese officials have said to us there is no way that a product sold in airports could be guaranteed to be exempt from that. There is no way they can guarantee those products are not tested on animals.\u201d There are two types of post-market testing, Choice spokeswoman and investigator Zoya Sheftalovich told Guardian Australia. In one, the China Food and Drug Association takes samples from products on the shelves within six months of registration and tests them on animals to make sure they comply with regulations, Sheftalovich said. \u201cThe second type of post-market testing, which is the type that can happen in airports, is when they just go in and randomly take products of the shelves and test them for various things,\u201d she said, adding that this was the testing The Body Shop would be subjected to. \u201cIn terms of how they\u2019re actually conducting the testing [that] is a question for the authorities themselves. They can conduct microbiological testing, or they can choose to conduct animal testing. \u201cThe risk is there, and I think in light of the strength of their statements they have made \u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good enough that they\u2019re willing to take a risk of animal testing at all.\u201d The Body Shop has long marketed itself heavily on its ethical stance against animal testing, and has previously said it would never sell in mainland China because of the animal testing requirement. \u201cThis is the central claim on which the whole Body Shop brand has been built over time,\u201d Kirkland said. \u201c\u2018Against animal testing\u2019 was their tagline for many years, and it still is a central selling point for consumers. We just think you can\u2019t have it both ways. You can\u2019t be against animal testing and sell in China at the same time.\u201d The executive chairman of The Body Shop Australia, Graeme Wise, told Choice the company did not designate airports as \u201cin-country\u201d because of the lack of mandatory pre-market testing required. \u201cWe feel like The Body Shop is being shifty here because its statements are contradictory,\u201d Kirkland said. As recently as November, The Body Shop was named as a company which \u201cheld firm\u201d against animal testing by Cruelty Free International and is \u201cleaping bunny\u201d certified by the organisation. \u201cThe Body Shop believes passionately that no animal should be harmed because of the cosmetics industry and we have a long commitment to this cause,\u201d Paul McGreevy, International Values and R&amp;D director of The Body Shop, told CFI. CFI\u2019s policy director, Dr Nick Palmer, told Guardian Australia it objected to all animal testing. \u201cWe would oppose companies selling in China \u2013 whether in airports or elsewhere \u2013 in conditions that are likely to lead to animal testing, and welcome those companies who have decided not to export cosmetics to China for that reason,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not so far been approached by companies finding that their products are subject to post-marketing testing using animals.\u201d In June this year amendments to China\u2019s animal testing policies come into force, which would allow domestically manufactured products to avoid animal testing. However, the softening of regulation won\u2019t yet apply to international imports, and post-market testing is likely to be strengthened, Humane Society International predicts. The Body Shop said at the time of the announcement it would \u201cexplore opportunities\u201d in China once it had more details about the amendments. \u201cAs the first beauty company to take action against animal testing for cosmetics, these reports mark a truly historic moment,\u201d said Jeremy Schwartz, chief executive and chairman. The Body Shop was acquired by L\u2019Or\u00e9al in 2006 for \u00a3652m. About 19% of L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s annual sales occur in China, according to Bloomberg. Travel retail news site The Moodie Report said in 2012 The Body Shop opened a number of new duty-free outlets, including in Shanghai. A L\u2019Or\u00e9al spokeswoman told Guardian Australia it had always felt animal testing of products in China was not needed. \u201cWe support the introduction of the alternative methods to animal testing that are already accepted internationally,\u201d she said. Choice told Guardian Australia it had also received reports of Body Shop products being sold in the Chinese high street market, but were unable to confirm if the products were legitimate imports or grey market.",
