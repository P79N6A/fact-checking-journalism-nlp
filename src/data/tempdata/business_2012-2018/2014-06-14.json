      "bodyText": "TESCO BANK Who are they? Tesco Bank, originally a joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland, has been wholly owned by the retailer since 2008. Since then about \u00a3600m has been spent building a standalone bank. It already offers a range of financial products \u2013 from credit cards and savings accounts to mortgages and pet insurance. Why are they different? Tesco says its new current account \"isn't just for Tesco customers\". There are no bank branches \u2013 this is primarily a \"digital\" business \u2013 though people can use some stores to pay in cash. It adds that there are \"no gimmicks\" \u2013 which, unfortunately for potential new customers, means it is not offering a \"golden hello\" in the form of cash, gift card or an extra helping of Clubcard points as an opening inducement. Will it work? Tesco Bank will be targeting the 6 million customers it already has, as well as the 16 million-plus people with a Clubcard. That established base, combined with its well-known marketing muscle, should put it in a pretty strong position. But the lack of branches and a \u00a35 monthly fee for those unable to stash \u00a3750 or more a month in the current account could hold it back. M&amp;S BANK Who are they? M&amp;S Bank is a joint venture between HSBC, which bought M&amp;S Money a decade ago, and Marks &amp; Spencer. It offers a range of financial products, including a recently launched free-to-use current account. It has 29 in-store M&amp;S Bank branches. Why are they different? M&amp;S Bank stole a march on rival retailer Tesco by launching its first \"mass market\" current account with no monthly fee just a few weeks before the supermarket giant pulled the wraps off its own offering. M&amp;S Bank claims to have brought \"trusted Marks &amp; Spencer brand values\" to banking, thereby delivering \"a new choice of bank on the high street\". It boasts that it offers the longest opening hours of any high street branches in the UK, which include evenings and weekends. Will it work? It is early days in terms of the new current account, though some commentators have claimed M&amp;S could pose a real threat to the high street banks. However, it is likely to appeal most to those who regularly shop at M&amp;S, and the fact the new account does not pay interest on credit balances means some potential customers will look elsewhere. METRO BANK Who are they? Metro Bank is a relatively new player with outlets in the south-east and London. Co-founded by Vernon Hill, a US financier, it launched in the UK in July 2010, and last month opened its 27th \"store\" \u2013 it doesn't seem to like the word \"branch\" \u2013 in Milton Keynes. Eight more stores are set to open later this year, and Metro says it now has more than 320,000 personal and business customer accounts. Why are they different? It offers \"seven-day-a-week branch banking, 362 days of the year\". At the time of its launch, Metro came in for some flak \u2013 but also valuable publicity \u2013 for its bone-shaped dog biscuits on the counter and water bowls in the foyer. Will it work? As with any new entrant, Metro faces a big challenge in persuading significant numbers to switch to its services. Its first set of products left some experts underwhelmed, but last month it announced respectable first-quarter results that saw year-on-year growth on lending and deposits of 298% and 131% respectively. VIRGIN MONEY Who are they? Virgin Money, part of Sir Richard Branson's group, expanded on to the high street after acquiring the \"good\" part of Northern Rock in January 2012. It has 75 branches \u2013 which it too calls stores \u2013 across the UK, most of which were formerly Northern Rock branches. It offers savings, mortgages, credit cards, pensions, investment and protection products, and plans to launch a current account \"later this year\", though it is thought its initial offering will be basic and will not feature an overdraft facility. Last month it said its mortgage balances had broken through the \u00a320bn mark. Why are they different? One of Virgin's claimed strengths is \"no hard sell\". It is also rolling out a number of \"lounges\" for its customers, which it claims are \"designed to be places where our customers can relax and local communities come together,\" adding: \"They are all part of our ambition to be a very different kind of bank.\" Will it work? Potential customers have been waiting a while for the current account \u2013 there is still no specific launch date. Arriving late at the party could put it at a disadvantage. In March, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, Virgin Money's chief executive, said it was difficult to compete with the big four banks, which dominate the current account market, because they do not pay interest on deposits. Paying interest on deposits in a bid to lure customers is a costly marketing technique. HANDELSBANKEN Who are they? Handelsbanken is the UK arm of the Swedish bank of the same name. It came to Britain in 1982 but only started doing domestic banking at the start of the noughties. It has 175 branches, though in many cases the premises feel more like offices than typical bank branches. Products include current accounts for personal customers, plus mortgages, savings accounts, personal loans and cards. On the business banking side, its customers range from corporates to SMEs. It says it never discloses customer numbers. Why are they different? It describes itself as \"a strongly decentralised\" organisation where the key words are \"local\" and \"low-key\". All the emphasis is on the local branch. It does not deploy national advertising or marketing campaigns, and says most of its business comes from referrals. Will it work? Say \"Handelsbanken\" to many people in the street and they would probably say \"who?\". That may be how the bank wants to do things, but it could limit its growth. However, it says it has seen large growth in its lending, and tends to score well in customer satisfaction surveys.",

      "bodyText": "Runaway house prices, a strong job market and buoyant consumer confidence: it is a cocktail for retail success not seen since the World Cup opener was played out in Munich's Allianz Arena in 2006. On Thursday, retail chains Argos and Homebase had just toasted bumper quarterly sales as the warm spring weather and the buildup to kick-off in S\u00e3o Paulo stoked sales of garden furniture, barbecues and TVs before a summer of sport. But just as tournament began in Brazil, Bank of England governor Mark Carney spoiled the party by warning the City that interest rates could move off their historic low \"sooner than markets currently expect\". By the time Marcelo had scored an own goal, 11 minutes in, the pound had gained against the dollar and the following day the market punished retailers \u2013 including Argos's and Homebase's owner, Home Retail Group \u2013 on fears a rise in borrowing costs could hit high-street spending. Home Retail Group was written off a basket case during the recession, as the squeeze on consumer spending devastated sales and profits. But as the green shoots reappeared it was enjoying a nascent sales recovery, with its shares up more than 30% in the past year. \"These businesses have got much more momentum than a year ago,\" says Conlumino analyst Neil Saunders. \"Argos is benefiting from a focus on digital services such as click and collect, which customers want, while Homebase is differentiating itself from B&amp;Q by focusing on the lifestyle end of the DIY market with more soft furnishings and premium brands.\" The retail group is also being buoyed by a wider industry recovery, adds Saunders, with DIY and furniture sales back in growth for the first time since the beginning of the crisis. The group's thoughtful new boss, John Walden, who succeeded Home Retail's long serving chief executive Terry Duddy in March, wasn't in a samba mood he updated investors earlier that day, describing underlying growth of 4.9% and 7.9% at Argos and Homebase as merely an \"encouraging start\". Indeed one of the first things Walden, an American whose career has included stints at Sears and Best Buy, has done since taking over is to initiate a business review that some believe could lead to radical shakeup of the FTSE 250 retailer, which was formed from the breakup of the GUS conglomerate in 2006. \"As a group we need to figure out what we stand for \u2013 why are we a group?\" is the philosophical question Walden put to one interviewer. With combined turnover of \u00a35.7bn, the two chains appear to have little in common other than a shared head office in Milton Keynes. Argos draws its shoppers from the mass market in the C2 and D socioeconomic groups while Homebase, with its Farrow &amp; Ball paint and Habitat chicken bricks, appeals more to the middle classes. \"The combination is not stupid,\" says Saunders. \"But there are no real synergies either. It's not like Waitrose and John Lewis, where the businesses fit hand in glove. It's more of a marriage of convenience.\" In the event of a restructuring, Saunders suggests there would be interest in Argos as a standalone business but questions over Homebase. \"It's difficult to see a future for Homebase outside Home Retail,\" he says. Having run Argos for nearly two years before his promotion, Walden is well versed in the workings of the catalogue chain, which generates the lion's share of group sales and profits. It is almost halfway though a five-year turnaround plan that is seeing its famous laminated catalogues jettisoned in favour of tablet computers in new-look \"digital\" stores. The makings of what some analysts consider a shrewd turnaround includes introducing Argos counters in Homebase stores as well as placing mini-shops on busy high streets, and possibly even in train stations, so shoppers can pop in and collect orders placed earlier by smartphone and tablet. The light at the end of the tunnel is fainter for Homebase, which has been in the doldrums since the recession put paid to bountiful credit, plentiful mortgages and the equity-release plans that had bankrolled Changing Rooms-style DIY projects. In 2014 it made an improved operating profit of \u00a318.9m on sales of \u00a31.5bn, compared with a high-water-mark profit of \u00a3114m in 2005. Walden did not dress up the Homebase figures, describing its gains as \"principally cyclical\", pointing to a fillip from the good weather as well as a pick-up in high-price items such as fitted kitchens as the housing market recovery once again gives Britons confidence to start spending on their homes. \"Unless we either repeat the record-breaking summer [weather] of last year, or England make it to the World Cup final, it's unlikely that Homebase will report a positive like-for-like sales performance in the second quarter,\" he warned. GUS bought Homebase from private-equity firm Permira for \u00a3900m in 2002, but its book value was written down by more than half a billion pounds in 2008 \u2013 an admission that it had overpaid for the retailer. During the lean times the chain received little investment, and shabby stores and scant staffing no doubt helped it finish 99th out of 100 in a Which? poll of best high-street shops. Last year Homebase started ringing the changes, embarking on a refurbishment programme designed to make its 323 shops more attractive and inspirational to the women that are its most loyal shoppers. \"Homebase has not been underinvested in, but it needs to be taken in a new direction,\" says Homebase managing director Paul Loft diplomatically. The company's latest thinking can be seen in its refurbished store in Worcester, which boasts new offerings including a free interior design service with City &amp; Guilds-trained decorating consultants helping shoppers create \"personalised mood boards\" using swatches of flooring, tiling, wallpaper and paint. Afterwards, shoppers can mull over their colour choices in the coffee shop, which now takes pride of place at the front of the store, or browse the large Habitat department. There are also more staff on the shop floor. \"We've done a very brave thing in retailing,\" says Loft. \"We have taken product out and given the space over to ideas and services. This cafe occupies prime retailing space.\" Homebase is spending \u00a325m on refits this year after the dozen stores revamped last year delivered sales uplifts of between 15% and 20%. \"Investment in our stores and use of technology is a vital part of our long-term plan to offer a customer experience that can't be found anywhere else,\" says Loft, pointing to the digital screens around the store, showing how-to videos of common DIY jobs such as hanging wallpaper. To stretch the \u00a31m spending earmarked for each store he has persuaded its suppliers, including Dulux and Crown, to contribute to the budget: \"We said to suppliers: if you join with us we can go further.\" Loft concedes that Homebase's fortunes are hitched to housing, as a lively market means both buyers and sellers are willing to spend on home improvements: \"We are seeing a move upwards [in housing transactions] and our business is heavily influenced by that, with a six-month timelag.\" Walden may or may not push through major reform; there is no certainty that the review will have a formal outcome. He was keeping mum last week, other than to say it was \"progressing well\".",

    "webTitle": "Mark Carney's new world nous may not be able to redress the balance of the UK's old-world economy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When President Obama recently let it be known that he would like Scotland to remain in the United Kingdom and the UK itself in the European Union, my mind went back to one of my late history master's favourite quotations. It was from George Canning, British foreign secretary and prime minister in the early 19th century. \"I called the New World into existence,\" Canning boasted on 12 December 1826, \"to redress the balance of the Old.\" Not to put too fine a point upon it, I wondered who in Downing Street had put the president up to it, the aim this time being not so much to redress the balance in Europe, as to prevent the UK and the rest of Europe from losing their balance. There is, of course, a view that outside intervention may be counterproductive in the resolution of the Scottish question. This is certainly the opinion of my good and much maligned friend Gordon Brown, who has emerged from purdah with a new book on Scotland \u2013 which is where he came in, all those years ago! \u2013 and a timely warning that \"patronising\" arguments in favour of the status quo may have a perverse effect. When Canning spoke, Britannia ruled the waves, and one way or another owned a fair proportion of the world. These days a fair proportion of the British economy is owned by the rest of the world, not least the revived \"British\" motor industry. This country, whose government refused to set up its own sovereign wealth fund to ensure that the proceeds of North Sea oil and gas were invested for the future, now finds many parts of its economy owned by foreign wealth funds. The Treasury was viscerally against \"hypothecation\" of revenue and it is notorious that, as far as the Thatcher government was concerned, the North Sea was a useful means of financing the huge increase in unemployment that resulted from policies that were supposed to produce a British economic miracle. Incidentally, without wishing to take part myself in the Scottish debate, I owe a debt to the formidable Alex Salmond, who helped me in the early 1980s when I wrote a book entitled Britain Without Oil. Looking back on that period, I think the Scottish Nationalists, if they had been able to make a grab for North Sea revenues when they were vast, would have had a more convincing budgetary argument than they do now, with revenues dwindling. Now the Canning quotation also applies to the situation at the Bank of England, where Mark Carney was brought in from the New World to redress the balance of the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street. The Napoleonic cliche about \"lucky generals\" certainly applies to Carney \u2013 at least so far; the timing of his arrival almost a year ago was perfect. It would be a mistake in accordance with the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy to attribute the subsequent economic recovery to him. The impact of monetary policy has been cumulative: record low interest rates and the explosive growth of the money supply were well established before his arrival as the saviour from the New World. As his Bank colleague Andrew Haldane said in a recent speech: \"On the Bank's own estimates, the UK economy would have been at least six percentage points smaller today without the combined effects of lower interest rates and large doses of QE. Or, in money terms, we as a nation would have been perhaps \u00a380bn-\u00a3100bn poorer.\" By the way, I like Haldane's reference elsewhere in his speech to \"so-called quantitative easing\". It is a silly piece of jargon for the old-fashioned practice of expanding the money supply, and has produced many a confused explanation. Carney's predecessor Lord King likes to joke: \"The only people who don't understand quantitative easing are economists.\" King's successor has plenty on his plate. With every public utterance his concerns about the housing crisis and its implications for financial stability become more manifest.

      "body": "<p>When President Obama recently let it be known that he would like Scotland to remain in the United Kingdom and the UK itself in the European Union, my mind went back to one of my late history master's favourite quotations. It was from George Canning, British foreign secretary and prime minister in the early 19th century. \"I called the New World into existence,\" Canning boasted on 12 December 1826, \"to redress the balance of the Old.\"</p> <p>Not to put too fine a point upon it, I wondered who in Downing Street had put the president up to it, the aim this time being not so much to redress the balance in Europe, as to prevent the UK and the rest of Europe from losing their balance.</p> <p>There is, of course, a view that outside intervention may be counterproductive in the resolution of the Scottish question. This is certainly the opinion of my good and much maligned friend Gordon Brown, who has emerged from purdah with a new book on Scotland \u2013 which is where he came in, all those years ago! \u2013 and a timely warning that \"patronising\" arguments in favour of the status quo may have a perverse effect.</p> <p>When Canning spoke, Britannia ruled the waves, and one way or another owned a fair proportion of the world. These days a fair proportion of the British economy is owned by the rest of the world, not least the revived \"British\" motor industry. This country, whose government refused to set up its own sovereign wealth fund to ensure that the proceeds of North Sea oil and gas were invested for the future, now finds many parts of its economy owned by foreign wealth funds.</p> <p>The Treasury was viscerally against \"hypothecation\" of revenue and it is notorious that, as far as the Thatcher government was concerned, the North Sea was a useful means of financing the huge increase in unemployment that resulted from policies that were supposed to produce a British economic miracle.</p> <p>Incidentally, without wishing to take part myself in the Scottish debate, I owe a debt to the formidable Alex Salmond, who helped me in the early 1980s when I wrote a book entitled <em>Britain Without Oil</em>.</p> <p>Looking back on that period, I think the Scottish Nationalists, if they had been able to make a grab for North Sea revenues when they were vast, would have had a more convincing budgetary argument than they do now, with revenues dwindling.</p> <p>Now the Canning quotation also applies to the situation at the Bank of England, where Mark Carney was brought in from the New World to redress the balance of the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street.</p> <p>The Napoleonic cliche about \"lucky generals\" certainly applies to Carney \u2013 at least so far; the timing of his arrival almost a year ago was perfect. It would be a mistake in accordance with the <em>post hoc ergo propter hoc </em>fallacy to attribute the subsequent economic recovery to him. The impact of monetary policy has been cumulative: record low interest rates and the explosive growth of the money supply were well established before his arrival as the saviour from the New World. As his Bank colleague Andrew Haldane said in a <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2014/speech732.pdf\" title=\"\">recent speech</a>: \"On the Bank's own estimates, the UK economy would have been at least six percentage points smaller today without the combined effects of lower interest rates and large doses of QE. Or, in money terms, we as a nation would have been perhaps \u00a380bn-\u00a3100bn poorer.\"</p> <p>By the way, I like Haldane's reference elsewhere in his speech to \"so-called quantitative easing\". It is a silly piece of jargon for the old-fashioned practice of expanding the money supply, and has produced many a confused explanation. Carney's predecessor Lord King likes to joke: \"The only people who don't understand quantitative easing are economists.\"</p> <p>King's successor has plenty on his plate. With every public utterance his concerns about the housing crisis and its implications for financial stability become more manifest. Perhaps he should have insisted, while negotiating his lucrative contract with the Treasury, that the government commit itself there and then to a \"housing drive\" of postwar proportions. As he pointedly says, with half the population of the UK, Canada builds twice as many houses.</p> <p>Despite being seen as the chancellor's man, Carney is also his own man. Unlike my old friend Lord Lawson, who claimed on the <em>Today</em> programme that the recovery proved the Keynesians were wrong, Carney, to his credit, is on record as acknowledging that the fiscal squeeze delayed the recovery. I sometimes worry about Lord Lawson.</p> <p>Also, Carney has a wry sense of humour: when announcing, at his Mansion House speech last week, that interest rates were likely to rise earlier than the market expected, he knew full well that the only reason why the market expected them to rise later was that it had been led to believe this by one Mark Carney.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Young professionals hoping to get a foot on the property ladder and people in their 40s or 50s hoping to fund their retirement through buy-to-let investments have had their plans thwarted by booming house prices in recent years. Now, however, there is a new option: crowdfunded buy-to-let. An entirely new industry, it could mean that buying a home to live in or to let is no longer the preserve of the wealthy. Crowdfunded projects attract a large number of relatively small sums of money from private investors, usually via a website. With buy-to-let, a crowdfunding company gathers investors who put in as little as \u00a3500 each to buy a property for rental for a fixed term \u2013 typically two to five years. The company manages the property and pays a regular dividend, with the prospect of capital growth as the value of the property rises. Many young people complain that owning property has become the preserve of those from affluent families, because no matter how hard they save towards a deposit rising prices undermine their efforts. But if what money they already have is invested in property, it can grow in line with the market. The extra investments that they can make should eventually produce a deposit large enough for them to buy a home. Last month Property Moose opened to investors with a minimum of \u00a3500. The firm's 28-year-old co-founder James Cadbury, from the confectionery-making family, said: \"I was 27 and wanted to get on the property ladder but couldn't because I never had a big enough deposit or income. All my friends were having the same problem. I've known some who have clubbed together to buy, but then I and my business partner thought with advances in technology we could do that on a new scale, so anyone with \u00a3500 can get a foot on the ladder.\" The firm has taken \u00a3130,000 from 50 investors, mostly aged around 30, in its first three weeks. \"When the pension reforms come in and a lot of older people have a lump sum to invest, they will also be looking at schemes like this.\" One investor is Hugh Hutchison, a 28-year-old lawyer who lives in London. \"I've wanted to buy a property since I left university, but haven't been able to because of the deposit issue,\" he said. \"So I was looking for a way to see the upside of the property price rises without having \u00a320,000 in the bank. \"I live in Brixton, where a modest two-bedroom flat costs \u00a3350,000, so even a 5% deposit is \u00a317,500, and a 20% deposit just isn't worth thinking about. But with crowdfunding I can get into it.\" Over the past decade, buying to let has become a popular alternative to traditional pensions. But it has only been for those with very substantial funds at their disposal. Crowdfunding is democratising that option. Dr Joe Cox from the University of Portsmouth Business School said: \"There's already a strong buy-to-let culture in the UK, but until now it has been the preserve of a relatively privileged few with the financial means to pay a deposit and for upkeep. The advantage of crowdfunding is that it smashes down the barriers to participation and offers the possibility for a much wider involvement in the buy-to-let market, perhaps turning us from the nation of shopkeepers that Adam Smith described into a nation of landlords.\" One of the first property crowdfunding sites was the House Crowd, founded two years ago. It owns and manages 62 homes and now buys an average of one a week. \"We've seen a number of investors putting money in because they can't get a foot on the property ladder otherwise,\" said Frazer Fearnhead, one of the founders. \"Our investors are everyone from manual workers to investment bankers but very few are professional property investors. Many invest a little bit in every project we do, to build something up for retirement. Half the people I speak to ask, 'Why am I bothering putting money into a pension?' And investing this way you control it, rather than handing your money over to some City institution, with all the shenanigans that go on there. So you control your own destiny.\"",

With buy-to-let, a crowdfunding company gathers investors who put in as little as \u00a3500 each to buy a property for rental for a fixed term \u2013 typically two to five years. The company manages the property and pays a regular dividend, with the prospect of capital growth as the value of the property rises.</p> <p>Many young people complain that owning property has become the preserve of those from affluent families, because no matter how hard they save towards a deposit rising prices undermine their efforts. But if what money they already have is invested in property, it can grow in line with the market. The extra investments that they can make should eventually produce a deposit large enough for them to buy a home.</p> <p>Last month <a href=\"http://www.propertymoose.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Property Moose</a> opened to investors with a minimum of \u00a3500. The firm's 28-year-old co-founder James Cadbury, from the confectionery-making family, said: \"I was 27 and wanted to get on the property ladder but couldn't because I never had a big enough deposit or income. All my friends were having the same problem. I've known some who have clubbed together to buy, but then I and my business partner thought with advances in technology we could do that on a new scale, so anyone with \u00a3500 can get a foot on the ladder.\"</p> <p>The firm has taken \u00a3130,000 from 50 investors, mostly aged around 30, in its first three weeks. \"When the pension reforms come in and a lot of older people have a lump sum to invest, they will also be looking at schemes like this.\"</p> <p>One investor is Hugh Hutchison, a 28-year-old lawyer who lives in London. \"I've wanted to buy a property since I left university, but haven't been able to because of the deposit issue,\" he said. \"So I was looking for a way to see the upside of the property price rises without having \u00a320,000 in the bank.</p> <p>\"I live in Brixton, where a modest two-bedroom flat costs \u00a3350,000, so even a 5% deposit is \u00a317,500, and a 20% deposit just isn't worth thinking about. But with crowdfunding I can get into it.\"</p> <p>Over the past decade, buying to let has become a popular alternative to traditional pensions. But it has only been for those with very substantial funds at their disposal. Crowdfunding is democratising that option. Dr Joe Cox from the <a href=\"http://www.port.ac.uk/portsmouth-business-school/\" title=\"\">University of Portsmouth Business School</a> said: \"There's already a strong buy-to-let culture in the UK, but until now it has been the preserve of a relatively privileged few with the financial means to pay a deposit and for upkeep. The advantage of crowdfunding is that it smashes down the barriers to participation and offers the possibility for a much wider involvement in the buy-to-let market, perhaps turning us from the nation of shopkeepers that Adam Smith described into a nation of landlords.\"</p> <p>One of the first property crowdfunding sites was <a href=\"http://www.thehousecrowd.com/\" title=\"\">the House Crowd</a>, founded two years ago. It owns and manages 62 homes and now buys an average of one a week. \"We've seen a number of investors putting money in because they can't get a foot on the property ladder otherwise,\" said Frazer Fearnhead, one of the founders. \"Our investors are everyone from manual workers to investment bankers but very few are professional property investors. Many invest a little bit in every project we do, to build something up for retirement. Half the people I speak to ask, 'Why am I bothering putting money into a pension?' And investing this way you control it, rather than handing your money over to some City institution, with all the shenanigans that go on there. So you control your own destiny.\"</p>",
