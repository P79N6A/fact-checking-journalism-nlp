      "bodyText": "Lloyds Bank is to radically change the way it charges for overdrafts on its 20m accounts, including those at Halifax and Bank of Scotland, in a move it claims will leave most customers better off \u2013 although one in 10 could pay significantly more. All existing charges for overdrafts will be abandoned in November and replaced with a single fee of 1p every day for every \u00a37 of overdraft used. It comes ahead of moves expected by the Financial Conduct Authority to cap \u201cextortionate\u201d fees for unplanned overdrafts, which critics say can work out as bad as the fees charged by payday lenders. Under current Lloyds rules, someone who goes more than \u00a325 over their overdraft limit is charged \u00a310 a day, and also faces a \u00a310 fee for every payment that is bounced, called the \u2018returned item fee\u2019. They also have to pay 19.89% interest on the balance. These charges will be scrapped under the new regime. From November, it means a customer who uses their \u00a31,000 overdraft for 10 days and spends two of those over the limit with an \u2018unplanned\u2019 overdraft will be charged \u00a314.20, compared with \u00a330.93 currently. Other winners will be those who don\u2019t go far into the red each month. Currently someone who goes \u00a3100 overdrawn at Lloyds for 10 days a month will pay \u00a36.38 a month in fees, but under the new system this will drop to \u00a31.40. Lloyds said nine out of 10 customers will either be better off or no worse off than before. But the losers will be those customers who have large agreed overdrafts and use them a lot each month. Lloyds said someone who has a \u00a31,000 overdraft limit and uses it for 10 days a month will now pay \u00a314.20, compared with \u00a310.88 before. The bank admitted that the 1p per \u00a37 overdraft is equivalent to an APR of 52%, and said it would encourage regular users of large overdrafts to switch to a personal loan instead. Last year the Competition and Markets Authority completed a two-year probe into banking, in which it highlighted how the big banks make around \u00a31.2bn a year from unarranged overdraft fees. Lloyds said it will lose revenue because of the changes, but refused to specify how much. The bank operates around a quarter of all current accounts in Britain, which suggests that it currently takes around \u00a3300m a year in fees that will now be abandoned. Vim Maru, group director of Lloyds, said: \u201cThis new approach is simple and clear, giving customers more control of their overdraft borrowing and how they manage their finances. When asked about our new approach, over 80% of customers said that they preferred it compared to the current charging format.\u201d The switch to flat-rate charging, a first among the major banks, is as much to do with the threat from \u2018fintech\u2019 challenger banks as the CMA inquiry, said Lloyds. Customers have switched en masse to app-based banking, it said, which means the bank can text customers and warn them of charges far more easily. \u201cCustomers who have given their mobile number to the bank will automatically receive free text alerts, including low balance alerts, putting them in control of their budget,\u201d said the bank. Students will continue to benefit from the interest-free overdrafts they are given when taking out an account, the bank added. But the current \u2018fee-free buffer\u2019 of \u00a325, which allows any customer to go overdrawn up to \u00a325 without incurring fees, will disappear. The 1p per \u00a37 deal means that a customer who goes up to \u00a36.99 overdrawn during the month will not be charged anything, but after that will start incurring charges. The new charging regime harmonises the fees across all of Lloyds\u2019 brands, including Halifax and Bank of Scotland. Halifax has a lower, \u00a35-a-day, fee for unplanned overdrafts, so the benefits for its customers will be slightly less. Other major banks are now expected to revise their overdraft deals. Personal finance expert Andrew Hagger of Moneycomms.co.uk said: \u201cThis is a fairly radical move by Lloyds and will be welcomed by customers who have in the past been hit with by the costly unauthorised charges under the bank\u2019s existing tariff. \u201cAt present someone who is \u00a326 overdrawn without arrangement could potentially be charged \u00a386 in unauthorised and monthly fees, something that\u2019s very difficult to justify. \u201cThe FCA is looking at the cost of short term credit and I\u2019m sure Lloyds won\u2019t be the last bank to review its overdraft tariff in the next few months.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Energy networks' \u00a37.5bn windfall 'should be returned to consumers'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Energy networks have been accused of exploiting UK consumers to enjoy a \u00a37.5bn windfall of unjustified \u201csky high\u201d profits, and urged to return the money in the form of a one-off \u00a3285 rebate to every household. Citizen\u2019s Advice said the companies that transmit electricity and gas around the UK, including National Grid, were reaping \u201ceye-watering\u201d average profit margins of 19% from their monopolies. That compares with the 4% margin that big six suppliers, such as British Gas, make selling power and gas to householders. The consumer group said Ofgem, which regulates the networks and sets limits on how much profit they can make, had allowed the firms to overinflate their projected costs of building pipes and wires. The energy regulator had also overestimated the business risks faced by the companies, and did not foresee an unprecedented period of low interest rates and bond returns, the charity said in a report published on Wednesday. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cEnergy network firms are enjoying a multibillion pound windfall at the expense of consumers. \u201cDecisions made by Ofgem have allowed gas and electricity network companies to make sky-high profits that we\u2019ve found are not justified by their performance.\u201d Ofgem rejected the claim it had failed consumers and said it had cut the costs of transmission, which account for nearly a quarter of the average household energy bill. Dermot Nolan, chief executive, said: \u201cWhile we don\u2019t agree with its modelling and the figures it has produced, the Citizens Advice report raises some important issues about network regulation which will be addressed in the next control.\u201d The industry is halfway through an eight-year period of price controls that started in 2013 for gas distributors, electricity and gas transmission firms, and 2015 for electricity distributors. Citizen\u2019s Advice calculated that over the eight years, the energy networks would return more \u00a325bn to their investors and creditors, and \u00a37.5bn of that would be excessive profits. That central estimate compared to a low one of \u00a33.5bn and a high estimate of up to \u00a311.1bn. While disputing the thrust of the report, Ofgem said that when setting the controls it had expected energy networks\u2019 profit margins to range from around 7% to double digits. In the event, it admitted that many had recorded returns at or around double digits. \u201cWhen we look at this next time we need to learn the lessons of why that is the case,\u201d said Jonathan Brearley, partner for networks at Ofgem. \u201cWe fixed a set of assumptions. It turned out this time it has turned out to the benefit of companies. However it could have gone the other way to the benefit of consumers,\u201d he added. Citizen\u2019s Advice called for the excess profits to be returned to consumers in the form of a one-off rebate, which it calculated would be worth \u00a3285 a household \u2013 about a quarter of the average annual dual-fuel bill. Failure to do so would risk incurring the wrath of billpayers and politicians, it warned. \u201cAs their colleagues in the supply business know, it does not take much for public opinion to curdle against an industry,\u201d the report said, in reference to calls earlier this year for a cap on the prices charged by energy suppliers. If suppliers do not return the money to consumers, the government should step in, the group said. On Wednesday, Ofgem will announce plans for the next set of price controls on energy networks, which will start in the 2020s. The regulator said one question would be whether eight-year periods were a sensible length for the controls, with Citizen\u2019s Advice saying that forecasting interest rates and other variables over such a long time was \u201can impossible task\u201d. Nolan said the next regime would be \u201ctougher\u201d for the energy networks.",

      "bodyText": "Coca-Cola is to increase the amount of recycled plastic in its bottles to 50% amid pressure from environmentalists over runaway use of the containers. The world\u2019s biggest drinks brand says it will hit its new UK recycling target - up from a previous goal of 40% - by 2020. The company described the proposal as ambitious but environmentalists said they did not go far enough. John Sauven, head of Greenpeace UK, said smaller drinks companies were already going much further. \u201cOther companies are already at 50% and are aiming to be at 100% by 2020. Coca Cola is huge in scale and this is not an ambitious target.\u201d Coca-Cola\u2019s UK and Europe arm currently has a target to increase the amount of recycled plastic or RPET in its bottles to 40% by 2020. It has already performed a U-turn over bottle deposit schemes following pressure from Greenpeace. In evidence to MPs before the UK election was called, the company said it now supported a deposit scheme. It had previously said it was opposed to such an idea. Figures obtained by the Guardian this month revealed that across the globe one million plastic bottles are bought by consumers every minute \u2013 roughly 20,000 a second. The number will jump another 20% by 2021, with annual sales rising to more than half a trillion a year, creating an environmental crisis some campaigners predict will be as serious as climate change. More than 480bn plastic drinking bottles were sold across the world in 2016, up from about 300bn a decade ago. By 2021 this will increase to 583.3bn, according to the most up-to-date estimates from Euromonitor International\u2019s global packaging trends report. Coca-Cola said it would hit its 50% target by investing millions of pounds in \u201cEurope\u2019s largest and most advanced plastic bottle recycling facility\u201d based in Lincolnshire. Jon Woods, general manager of Coca Cola Britain said today\u2019s announcement was the start of an effort to ensure all of its packaging was \u201crecovered and recycled.\u201d \u201cDoubling the amount of recycled material in all of our plastic bottles is a significant investment and sends a clear signal we want to play a positive role in supporting the circular economy here in Great Britain.\u201d Sources within the recycling industry said Coca-Cola was competing with other brands to be first to announce that it was making dramatic changes to its packaging to use more recycled plastic and recycle more of its bottles. One source said: \u201cThis is because of a combination of consumer pressure and pressure from environmental groups. There is a feeling that no one wants to be the brand which is littering beaches with plastic and there is something of a race among brands to get their green message out first.\u201d Louise Edge, senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cPeople expect companies like Coca-Cola to make their bottles out of 100% recycled content, not virgin plastic. But the bigger question is how Coca-Cola will reduce the sheer scale of plastic it\u2019s pumping out. \u201cProducing over 100 billion single-use plastic bottles every year, Coke\u2019s plastic footprint has been stomped into our planet\u2019s environment. What\u2019s their plan to stop all that plastic ending up in our oceans, streets and beaches?\u201d There has been growing concern about the impact of plastics pollution in oceans around the world. Last month scientists found nearly 18 tonnes of plastic on one of the world\u2019s most remote islands, an uninhabited coral atoll in the South Pacific. Globally Coca-Cola has repeatedly refused to release data to Greenpeace about its global plastic usage. The environmental campaign group estimates that Coca-Cola produces more than 100bn plastic bottles every year \u2013 or 3,400 a second. The top six drinks companies in the world use a combined average of just 6.6% of recycled plastic (PET) in their products, according to Greenpeace. A third have no targets to increase their use of recycled plastic and none are aiming to use 100% across their global production. Plastic drinking bottles could be made out of 100% recycled plastic, known as RPET \u2013 and campaigners are pressing big drinks companies to radically increase the amount of recycled plastic in their bottles. But brands have been hostile to using more RPET for cosmetic reasons. But the recycling source told the Guardian: \u201cConsumer pressure and the image of plastic littering our beaches is making them think again.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A slowdown in food sales at Marks &amp; Spencer has spooked investors who have increasingly relied on brisk trade in its upmarket food halls to prop up its struggling clothing arm. M&amp;S\u2019s shares were marked down by more than 4% after the retailer revealed food sales in stores open more than one year had fallen over the last three months. The 0.1% decline \u2013 contrasting with a 0.6% rise pencilled in by analysts \u2013 comes at a time when sales of its supermarket rivals have been boosted by inflation and the recent heatwave. Underlying food sales had also declined 2.1% in the previous quarter. \u201cIt is a disappointing food number given we have been seeing increasingly resilient UK figures from most of the grocers,\u201d said Shore Capital analysts Darren Shirley. \u201cThe question is whether this a quarterly blip?\u201d M&amp;S chief executive Steve Rowe conceded that the retailer had made some mistakes, including removing products from its shelves that customers had missed, while an attempt to cut back on waste had also affected the availability of meat and fish. There was a need for \u201cstronger promotions\u201d, he said, adding that the performance of stores was also being affected by expansion as new M&amp;S food outlets sprung up on their doorstep. \u201cWe have been in fairly long-term growth in food whereas others are playing a recovery game,\u201d said Rowe in defence of the performance. \u201cWe are continuing to gain [food] market share.\u201d Rowe is seeking to revive the 132-year-old retailer\u2019s declining profits. His biggest job is turning around its clothing arm where sales have been falling for several years. Like-for-like clothing and homeware sales were down 1.2% in the 13 weeks to 1 July, which was an improvement on the 5.9% slump recorded in the previous quarter. Rowe has slashed the number of clothing promotions it runs and said full price clothing sales \u2013 a guide to profitability \u2013 had increased 7%. \u201cI\u2019m delighted with where we are (on clothing),\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gained full price market share, volume market share, (and) market share in stores.\u201d But Rowe also cautioned that consumer confidence had dipped in recent weeks, describing shopper behavour as \u201cvolatile\u201d as households juggle rising living costs. \u201cCustomers are very much shopping for now and cautious with their spend,\u201d he said. Traditionally lower margin, M&amp;S\u2019s food aisles generate over half of its sales and about a third of profits. But since taking over in April 2016, Rowe has made it clear that its food halls will become even more important as it decreases the amount of shopfloor space devoted to clothing. Last year the retailer said it would close 30 \u201cfull-line\u201d stores \u2013 which sell clothing, homewares and food \u2013 and convert 45 more into food-only shops. In May, M&amp;S reported a 64% drop in annual profits to \u00a3176.4m after \u00a3437m of exceptional charges relating to Rowe\u2019s turnaround plan.",

      "bodyText": "Pearson is still going to own a quarter of Penguin Random House, so it\u2019s not too late to hope that it can learn to tell a story like it is. Please, drop this bland corporate talk about \u201crebasing\u201d the dividend. The cut in the offering is from 52p to 17p a share, or thereabouts, which is too severe to dress in neutral language. Pearson\u2019s status as an investment one might wish to own for income is about to be obliterated. The shame is that Pearson\u2019s sale of a 22% stake in PRH has been secured on terms that look respectable, at least in circumstances where there was only one possible buyer \u2013 German media group Bertelsmann, which owns 53% to Pearson\u2019s current 47%. Pearson will collect $1bn (\u00a3778m) in cash, via a combination of the sale of the stake and a dividend, in a transaction that values PRH at about seven times its top-line earnings. That valuation feels roughly right, which is why Pearson\u2019s shares initially rose. They finished 5% lower because the other half of the announcement hinted at the horrors in store for the dividend. A cut was signalled in January, but now the size is becoming clearer. Pearson wants its new \u201csustainable\u201d dividend to be covered at least twice by earnings from its core educational business \u2013 in other words, excluding any contribution from the remaining 25% stake in PRH. But, since those core earnings could be just 37p a share this year, that means the new dividend could be in the 15p-18p range. The implied dividend yield is just 2.5%, a ratio one might associate with a company with strong long-term growth prospects. Pearson, by contrast, has produced a string of profits warnings and that same January statement binned the old earnings target for 2018. An optimist might say that, with a balance sheet reinforced with the PRH proceeds, the company is now freer to invest in its education businesses, especially in the US. Hasn\u2019t chief executive John Fallon predicted that, when the dust settles, the digital future will be at least as profitable as the analogue past? Well, yes, he has. But proving the point is the hard part. Pearson has now sold the FT Group, for \u00a3844m in 2015, and now crystallised more than half the value in PRH. The proceeds on both occasions look OK \u2013 but neither disposal would have been necessary if the core business had been fixed. Carillion must move fast to avoid collapse Another day, another share price plunge for Carillion, the construction contractor that on Monday whacked its shareholders with a \u00a3845m provision. Tuesday\u2019s 33% fall to 78p means the company\u2019s value has collapsed by 60% this week. A business with annual revenues of \u00a35bn and 48,000 employees is now worth just \u00a3330m. Investors\u2019 air of panic is understandable since almost every analyst agrees that the self-help actions Carillion announced on day one \u2013 stopping dividends to save \u00a380m and selling a few businesses \u2013 won\u2019t be enough to stabilise the company. Fresh equity will be needed, maybe as much as \u00a3500m, implying massive dilution for current owners. Thus it is virtually impossible to say what a \u201ccorrect\u201d share price should be. It\u2019s all guesswork until one knows how much cash is required. The best advice for stand-in chief executive Keith Cochrane is to get on with the job of raising equity as fast as possible. He faces the usual problem, however. How do you make a pitch for fresh funds when you haven\u2019t got a solid story to sell to investors? Carillion is hoping it can wait until September before unveiling the findings of its \u201cthorough review of the business and the capital structure\u201d. If that means eight weeks, it would be speedy by normal standards. But, if humanly possible, Cochrane should try to go faster. The deficit in the pension fund was \u00a3587m at the last count and those pensioners deserve to hear even an outline of a recovery plan as soon as possible. Taylor review\u2019s overtime proposal is overdue The Resolution Foundation is right: the most radical idea in the Taylor review had little to do with the \u201cgig\u201d economy. Rather, it was the proposal that overtime should be paid at a rate higher than the national minimum wage. That could affect millions of people in the retail and care sectors. The idea is good. Insecure zero-hours and short-time contracts have flourished, in part, because it is so easy for a company to help itself to maximum labour flexibility. From the point of view of the employer, the arrangement is costless if all hours are paid at the same rate. Taylor\u2019s sound principle is that flexibility should not benefit the employer at the unreasonable expense of the worker. He gives the example of an individual on a minimum-wage contract that guarantees only six hours work a week but who is regularly asked to work more. The first six hours would be paid as normal; others would attract a premium. The review calls on the government to ask the Low Pay Commission to take a look. One hopes that doesn\u2019t mean the long grass beckons. Creating a financial incentive for employers to reduce their reliance on zero-hours and short-time contracts is a sensible and pragmatic proposal.",

      "body": "<p>Pearson is still going to own a quarter of Penguin Random House, so it\u2019s not too late to hope that it can learn to tell a story like it is. Please, drop this bland corporate talk about \u201crebasing\u201d the dividend. The cut in the offering is from 52p to 17p a share, or thereabouts, which is too severe to dress in neutral language. Pearson\u2019s status as an investment one might wish to own for income is about to be obliterated.</p> <p>The shame is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/11/pearson-sells-50-shades-of-grey-publisher-penguin-random-house-bertelsmann\">Pearson\u2019s sale of a 22% stake in PRH</a> has been secured on terms that look respectable, at least in circumstances where there was only one possible buyer \u2013 German media group Bertelsmann, which owns 53% to Pearson\u2019s current 47%. Pearson will collect $1bn (\u00a3778m) in cash, via a combination of the sale of the stake and a dividend, in a transaction that values PRH at about seven times its top-line earnings. That valuation feels roughly right, which is why Pearson\u2019s shares initially rose.</p> <p>They finished 5% lower because the other half of the announcement hinted at the horrors in store for the dividend. A cut was signalled in January, but now the size is becoming clearer. Pearson wants its new \u201csustainable\u201d dividend to be covered at least twice by earnings from its core educational business \u2013 in other words, excluding any contribution from the remaining 25% stake in PRH. But, since those core earnings could be just 37p a share this year, that means the new dividend could be in the 15p-18p range.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/11/pearson-sells-50-shades-of-grey-publisher-penguin-random-house-bertelsmann\">Pearson sells slice of Penguin for $1bn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The implied dividend yield is just 2.5%, a ratio one might associate with a company with strong long-term growth prospects. Pearson, by contrast, has produced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/18/pearson-penguin-random-house-shares-dive-profit-warning\">a string of profits warnings and that same January statement binned the old earnings target for 2018</a>.</p> <p>An optimist might say that, with a balance sheet reinforced with the PRH proceeds, the company is now freer to invest in its education businesses, especially in the US. Hasn\u2019t chief executive John Fallon predicted that, when the dust settles, the digital future will be at least as profitable as the analogue past?</p> <p>Well, yes, he has. But proving the point is the hard part. Pearson has now sold the FT Group, for \u00a3844m in 2015, and now crystallised more than half the value in PRH. The proceeds on both occasions look OK \u2013 but neither disposal would have been necessary if the core business had been fixed.</p> <h2>Carillion must move fast to avoid collapse</h2> <p>Another day, another share price plunge for Carillion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/10/carillion-boss-richard-howson-steps-down-shares-crash\">the construction contractor that on Monday whacked its shareholders with a \u00a3845m provision</a>. Tuesday\u2019s 33% fall to 78p means the company\u2019s value has collapsed by 60% this week. A business with annual revenues of \u00a35bn and 48,000 employees is now worth just \u00a3330m.<br></p> <p>Investors\u2019 air of panic is understandable since almost every analyst agrees that the self-help actions Carillion announced on day one \u2013 stopping dividends to save \u00a380m and selling a few businesses \u2013 won\u2019t be enough to stabilise the company. Fresh equity will be needed, maybe as much as \u00a3500m, implying massive dilution for current owners. Thus it is virtually impossible to say what a \u201ccorrect\u201d share price should be. It\u2019s all guesswork until one knows how much cash is required.</p> <p>The best advice for stand-in chief executive Keith Cochrane is to get on with the job of raising equity as fast as possible. He faces the usual problem, however. How do you make a pitch for fresh funds when you haven\u2019t got a solid story to sell to investors?</p> <p>Carillion is hoping it can wait until September before unveiling the findings of its \u201cthorough review of the business and the capital structure\u201d. If that means eight weeks, it would be speedy by normal standards. But, if humanly possible, Cochrane should try to go faster. The deficit in the pension fund was \u00a3587m at the last count and those pensioners deserve to hear even an outline of a recovery plan as soon as possible.</p> <h2>Taylor review\u2019s overtime proposal is overdue</h2> <p>The Resolution Foundation is right: the most radical idea in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/11/may-relaunches-premiership-with-new-protections-for-gig-economy-workers\">the Taylor review</a> had little to do with the \u201cgig\u201d economy. Rather, it was the proposal that overtime should be paid at a rate higher than the national minimum wage. That could affect millions of people in the retail and care sectors.</p> <p>The idea is good. Insecure zero-hours and short-time contracts have flourished, in part, because it is so easy for a company to help itself to maximum labour flexibility. From the point of view of the employer, the arrangement is costless if all hours are paid at the same rate.</p> <p>Taylor\u2019s sound principle is that flexibility should not benefit the employer at the unreasonable expense of the worker. He gives the example of an individual on a minimum-wage contract that guarantees only six hours work a week but who is regularly asked to work more. The first six hours would be paid as normal; others would attract a premium.</p> <p>The review calls on the government to ask the Low Pay Commission to take a look. One hopes that doesn\u2019t mean the long grass beckons. Creating a financial incentive for employers to reduce their reliance on zero-hours and short-time contracts is a sensible and pragmatic proposal.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Kathrin Muehlbronner, a Moody\u2019s Senior Vice President, explains that the agency is worried that Britain will exit the EU without a good agreement. While the negotiations with the EU have recently started, it remains unclear whether the UK government can eventually deliver a reasonably good outcome for the UK. The likelihood of an abrupt - and damaging - exit with no agreement and reversion to WTO trading rules has increased compared to our expectation directly after the referendum, with the government so far pursuing objectives that imply a \u2018hard\u2019 exit.\u201d In Moody\u2019s base case scenario though, the UK and the EU will manage to agree on a free trade arrangement as this remains in the interests of both sides, Muehlbronner adds. A late PS: Rating agency Moody\u2019s added to the chorus of gloom today by warning that Brexit-related uncertainty is putting the UK\u2019s credit rating at risk. In a statement, Moody\u2019s says that the UK\u2019s creditworthiness is under pressure following last summer\u2019s vote to leave EU, and ongoing uncertainty over how the negotiations will play out. The agency questions whether Britain can really achieve a \u201creasonably good\u201d outcome from its talks with Brussels. Moody\u2019s also warns that the loss of the government\u2019s majority in last month\u2019s elections has raised the \u201cpolitical and fiscal risks\u201d facing the UK. In a generally gloomy assessment, Moody\u2019s also warns that the UK economy is already slowing, and this will get worse. It says: The UK economy has started to slow, and Moody\u2019s expects the UK economy to weaken significantly through the remainder of this year, with the baseline scenario seeing growth declining to 1.5% this year and 1.0% in 2018, compared to 1.8% in 2016. In the medium term, Britain\u2019s growth prospects could be \u201cmaterially weaker\u201d if it doesn\u2019t achieve access to the single markets on good terms (something Ben Broadbent\u2019s speech also covered). To sum up: Britain\u2019s credit rating, already one notch below Triple-A with Moody\u2019s, could be at risk.... And finally... European stock markets all fell today. In London, the FTSE ended down 40 points, or 0.55%m, at 7,329. Pearson let the selloff, losing 5%, after its deal to sell a near $1bn stake in Penguin Random House failed to impress the City. Analysts are concerned it could lead to lower dividends. Marks &amp; Spender shed 4.6% after reporting a small drop in food sales in the last quarter, as well as its traditional fall in clothing sales. The pound also remains lower, after Ben Broadbent dashed our hopes of fresh guidance on UK interest rates. To be fair to the deputy governor, he did give us a very decent speech on trade instead, laced with warnings about the perils of a bad Brexit deal. So the pound is hovering around $1.285 tonight, down 0.2%. David Madden of CMC Market explains: Mr Broadbent discussed international trade, but not his views on interest rates. Dealers were disappointed with the lack of monetary policy remarks, so they had little reason to be long the pound. And that\u2019s all tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Over in Greece, the country\u2019s bank governor Yiannis Stournaras has poured cold water on the government\u2019s aim of returning to the financial markets imminently. Many Greek newspapers are saying Stournaras has put a \u201cbreak\u201d on the plan to tap markets following the conclusion of tortuous bailout negotiations with creditors Helena Smith reports: In his first public intervention since the government made clear its intentions to return to markets, Stournaras has surprised many saying such a move would be premature. When asked by the Wall Street Journal about the finance ministry\u2019s plans to tap public bond markets, possibly as early as next week, the former finance minister\u2019s reaction was decidedly cool. \u201cI think it is a bit early,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it would be even better, for instance, if Greece proceeds with two or three emblematic privatizations in the period to come. That would be more helpful to tap markets later.\u201d Privatisations have lagged far behind creditor-mandated targets with prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 government initially viscerally opposing plans to sell off the country\u2019s prime assets. But in recent months, as pressure has mounted, the opposition has dissipated. Stournaras though often at odds with the Tsipras government and a firm believer in the merits of European economic union, has frequently spoken warmly of the finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and his handling of the economy in interviews with the Guardian. Szu Ping Chan of the Telegraph has covered Broadbent\u2019s speech. Here\u2019s a flavour (more here). The Government must protect the City in Brexit negotiations and keep EU trade links open if it is to safeguard growth and maintain UK living standards, a top Bank of England official has signalled. Ben Broadbent, deputy governor for monetary policy, warned that a pivot away from exports to the EU would force Britain to \u201cshift away from producing the things it\u2019s been relatively good at\u201d, such as financial services. He said this would damage both the UK and 27 nation bloc, hitting growth and pushing up prices. Over in America, the latest employment stats have just landed. They show that the number of vacancies across the US fell by around 300,000 in May, to 5.7 million. That could be a bad sign for the economy. But there\u2019s good news too; The number of hires rose to 5.5 million in May, a gain of 429,000. Kathleen Brooks of City Index suspects that Broadbent is still firmly in the \u2018no change\u2019 camp at the Bank of England. She says: His speech in Aberdeen, the seat of the UK oil industry, gave no direct reference to his views on the outlook for UK monetary policy, however, he was very concerned about the UK\u2019s trade prospects after Brexit, something that is most likely shared by the export-orientated audience in Aberdeen. It doesn\u2019t seem like a stretch to assume that if Broadbent is concerned about Brexit\u2019s impact on trade then he is unlikely to make things harder for exporters by voting to raise interest rates any time soon. Thus, the hawks on the committee, now just McClafferty and Saunders, could remain in the minority for some time. Reminder, the next Bank of England meeting is on August 3rd. City trader Stewart Hampton has a good take on the Broadbent speech, and why he didn\u2019t cover interest rates. Here\u2019s one last chart from Ben Broadbent\u2019s speech, which looks at globalisation. It shows how world trade slumped in the great depression and during the second world war (no surprise really), and then grew, in fits and starts, after WW2 ended. Broadbent sees four lessons: One is that the current extent of world trade isn\u2019t entirely novel and should in some ways be seen as a recovery. World trade had grown very strongly under the classical gold standard, during the second half of the 19th century. The same goes for the capital flows that financed these exchanges. The catastrophes of the world wars, and the intervening Great Depression, put all that into reverse. Partly as a natural consequence of economic contraction, partly thanks to outright protectionism, trade volumes fell sharply between 1914 and 1950, even relative to world GDP. Second, although the conditions for a revival began to be laid during the 1950s it wasn\u2019t until the 1960s and early 1970s that trade costs started to fall, and trade intensity to rise, in earnest. In this first phase of (re-)globalisation, during the 1970s and 80s, much of the growth in trade occurred between developed economies. Third, there was a further and very marked rise in trade intensity during the 1990s and the early part of the last decade, as developing economies entered the world trading system. Finally, you can see clearly how world trade has stalled, relative to GDP, since the financial crisis a decade ago. Ben Broadbent\u2019s speech is a full-throated defence of the benefits of trade, say City experts. Mohammad Jamei of UK Finance, the trade body, is tweeting the key points: European credit strategist Tomas Hirst says Broadbent has shone a light on the problems caused by Brexit Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s Lucy Meakin: The FT\u2019s Gavin Jackson tweets: And here\u2019s Peter Thal Larsen, economics editor at Breaking Views. Ben Broadbent also outlines how the poorest Britons would suffer if trade with the EU was badly damaged by Brexit. He starts by reminding his audience in Aberdeen about the Corn Laws, which drove up the cost of food from abroad - lining landowners pockets but hurting the less well-off (whose meagre incomers were swallowed up by essentials) Then he shows these charts: And here\u2019s what it means: Much of the work on trade and inequality focuses on the potentially differential effect on wages and employment. The gross costs of trade may not be evenly distributed. As Chart 11 demonstrates, however, the gross benefits of lower import prices are probably skewed as well. On average, things that are more tradable are also consumed disproportionately by the less well-off. It turns out this pattern is common to all developed economies. Chart 12 is taken from a recent study by Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016), describing what would happen to relative consumer prices, and thereby the distribution of income, if international trade with the developing world were suddenly shut down. In every country, including the UK, it\u2019s the less well-off who would be worse affected by the consequent rise in prices. I\u2019m no fashion expert, but Ben Broadbent\u2019s tie does remind me of the Queen\u2019s anti-Brexit hat. It\u2019s certainly a similar share of EU blue..... Ben Broadbent has also brushed up his grasp of the UK economy by visiting a Scotch whisky distillery. The pound has also shed its early gains against the euro, falling back to 88.5p, from 88.25p. Ben Broadbent\u2019s failure to discuss interest rates in Aberdeen may be a sign that he\u2019s planning to vote for \u2018no change\u2019 next month. Larry Elliott, our economics editor, explains: Those looking for clues as to how Ben Broadbent will vote in next month\u2019s crunch meeting of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee from his speech in Aberdeen needed the detective skills of Sherlock Holmes. Threadneedle Street\u2019s deputy governor was expected to provide his thoughts on whether interest rates should be raised or left at their current level of 0.25%, but instead devoted his address to the benefits of international trade. But this was surely a case, as in the mystery solved by Holmes, of the dog that didn\u2019t bark. Broadbent voted for no change at the MPC\u2019s last meeting and the fact that he didn\u2019t mention interest rates once in his speech suggests strongly that he will vote the same way again in August. Simon French of Panmure Gordon agrees.... After all that build-up, Ben Broadbent\u2019s speech doesn\u2019t actually discuss UK monetary policy at all! The pound had shed all its early gains, falling back below $1.29, on disappointment that the deputy governor hasn\u2019t given any hints about when he might vote to raise interest rates. Breaking! Ben Broadbent, deputy governor of the Bank of England, is on his feet in Aberdeen now. And his message to the Scottish Council for Development and Industry is that Britain will suffer if its existing trade links with the EU are weakened by Brexit. Broadbent is talking about classical economics, reminding his audience of Adam Smith\u2019s work in the Wealth of Nations and the idea that international trade can be a win-win situation, not a zero-sum game. Broadbent adds that David Ricardo\u2019s Principles of Political Economy took this idea further... What matters for trading patterns, he explained, was not just absolute advantage \u2013 whether a domestic sector was more productive than its peers in other countries \u2013 but also its productivity relative to other sectors at home (\u201ccomparative advantage\u201d).This was important, because it meant that, in principle, a country could have lower productivity across the board, in the production of every good, and still end up as a net exporter of some of them. So what does that mean for today? Over to you, Dr Broadbent.... Well, obviously the EU economies are highly developed, so our trade with Europe \u2013 which is extensive \u2013 is less skewed towards labour intensive goods and services than that with developing economies. Nevertheless, it has allowed for a great deal of specialisation. And if the theme of this talk is that the benefits of trade involve imports as much as they do exports, the same point applies. Put simply, a significant curtailment of trade with Europe would force the UK to shift away from producing the things it\u2019s been relatively good at, and therefore tends to export to the EU, and towards the things it currently imports and is relatively less good at. He also provides this chart , showing how Britain has a \u201ccomparative advantage\u201d in areas like financial services, but not in food and heavy-duty machinery. So if trade links suffer, Britain will make less money from its service sector, and have to replace EU imports with domestic products. At a price. And of course, the same is true of the EU (but on a smaller scale). Broadbent concludes: All else equal, the first shift (i.e. away from services exports) would tend to lower UK income, the second to raise certain costs (that is, of food and machinery). And, albeit on a smaller scale, relative to their (much larger) GDP, the same would be true for the EU16. Trade really is mutually beneficial and less of it costs us all. That these truths are a couple of centuries old, and not always widely accepted, doesn\u2019t make them any less true. Excitement is building in the City as investors await Ben Broadbent\u2019s speech. The pound is a little higher, at $1.2915, up nearly half a cent today. The Bank of England\u2019s session on the importance of numeracy hasn\u2019t yielded much hard news, I\u2019m afraid. The best I can find is this warning from BoE chief economist, Andy Haldane: Over in Greece the finance ministry has embarked on plans to return to bond markets \u2013 possibly as early as next week - following the disbursement yesterday of \u20ac7.7bn in bailout funds. Helena Smith reports from Athens Greek finance ministry officials are mulling issuing up to \u20ac3.5bn worth of five-year bonds with a yield of between 4.75% to 4.85 % in what would amount to a taster-tap of the markets. Investors who bought Greece\u2019s previous five-year debt, in 2014, would be invited to hand in their existing bonds and invest in new longer-dated paper. The issue would seek to capitalise on the optimism generated by the completion of the country\u2019s last bailout review and concomitant release of funds. Well-placed sources say they want to make the move before the International Monetary Fund announces on July 27 whether it will participate in Greece\u2019s current bailout programme. As the Washington-based body has said this will depend on adequate debt relief measures being agreed beforehand \u2013 an unlikely step before Germany\u2019s federal elections in late September \u2013 Athens is keen to avoid negative debt sustainability publicity clouding a potential bond issue. The issue would be of huge symbolic value spawning further faith that Greece is back on the road to normality, officials say. Construction and support services firm Carillion is having another bad day after yesterday\u2019s profit warning, which sent the shares plunging 39%. The shares are down a further 20% today, slumping to 93p \u2013 their lowest level since 2000 \u2013 and wiping out half the company\u2019s market value since Monday morning\u2019s announcement. It is now worth just over \u00a3400m. Carillion is battling rising debts and cashflow problems and is struggling to stay within its borrowing limits. Analysts say it will have to tap investors for money through a big (\u00a3500m) rights issue; it\u2019s already canned its dividend. They were taken aback by the \u00a3845m writedown announced yesterday, which relates to several big PPP contracts in the UK and the cost of pulling out of several Middle Eastern countries. Carillion\u2019s chief executive Richard Howson stepped down with immediate effect and interim CEO Keith Cochrane has been tasked with overseeing a \u201ccomprehensive review of the business and the capital structure,\u201d until a permanent successor is found. He is due to report back to investors in September. Carillion has built the expansion of Liverpool FC\u2019s main stand at Anfield and is working on the Royal Liverpool University hospital, but has decided not to bid for of big construction projects any more and will focus on maintaing roads, railways, government buildings and military bases instead. The FTSE 250 firm has blamed last year\u2019s Brexit vote and election, coupled with a slowdown in the Middle East, for its woes, but some of the problems go back further (note for example the soaring costs on the tram-train link between Sheffield and Rotherham). Construction of the Royal Liverpool University hospital has been beset with delays, most recently after after workers found \u201cextensive\u201d asbestos on site and cracks in the new building. Carillion also blamed bad weather... Over in Paris, some of the world\u2019s top bankers have been discussing their plans for Brexit at a financial forum. Stuart Gulliver, CEO of HSBC, told the audience that HSBC would move 1,000 jobs from the City of London to France if Britain left the single market (reiterating comments made in January). Gulliver said: \u201cThere is about 1,000 jobs out of 43,000 that are employed in the UK that will be unlawful for our activities to be carried out of the UK, if it\u2019s hard Brexit,\u201d Gulliver also backed plans from Emmanuel Macron, the new French president, to shake up France\u2019s labour market, \u201cThe package of reforms suggested last week is very, very positive.\u201d That will please the French government mightily, as it attempts to persuade highly paid financial workers to shift from London to Paris. Jamie Dimon, the head of JP Morgan, told the conference that his bank is preparing for a hard Brexit (which would mean City banks losing their passporting rights across the EU). Boris Glass, senior economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings, has a gloomy take on Britain\u2019s economic prospects in today\u2019s report. Glass says: \u201cGrowth is set to remain on a moderate trajectory as imported inflation squeezes household budgets and uncertainty about the outcome of the EU exit negotiations dampens investment.\u201d On Brexit, S&amp;P is concerned that Britain could suffer a \u2018cliff edge\u2019 departure from the EU. There could be little time to agree a new relationship, especially if the two sides can\u2019t agree the \u2018divorce bill\u2019 first. If negotiations stall, the pound could slump again, driving inflation higher, it adds. My colleague Zoe Wood has spotted protests outside Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s AGM, and a light-fingered investors inside the meeting! Does that count as a special dividend? Credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has just added its voice to the chorus of anxiety around Britain\u2019s economy. In a new report, S&amp;P warns that UK economic growth is likely to slow over the next two years. It believe rising inflation, due to the weak pound, will hurt domestic spending without giving exporters the boost they need. Here are the key points: We expect that a decline in U.K. real wages this year, followed by moderate rises at best next year, will weigh on household spending growth. A boost to net exports from the weaker pound is unlikely to offset weakness in domestic demand. We forecast GDP growth will slow to 1.4% this year and 0.9% in 2018. Brexit uncertainties pose downside risks to this forecast. We expect the Bank of England\u2019s current ultra-accommodative stance to continue over the medium term, and no rate hike before mid-2019. Ben Broadbent\u2019s speech has just been pushed back to 1.30pm, from noon. Here\u2019s the latest from the Bank of England: Ben Broadbent: Speech at the Scottish Council for Development and Industry during regional visit to Scotland (13:30), Aberdeen. Text to be released. (Private, invitation only) Pearson and Marks &amp; Spencer have helped to drag the FTSE 100 into the red this morning. The blue-chip index is down 49 points, or 0.7%, at 7320. That means its underperforming the rest of Europe. The strengthening pound is also weighing on shares in London (as a stronger sterling is bad for multinationals). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says today\u2019s appearances by Haldane and Broadbent could cause ructions: In what looks like is going to be a pretty dull day, sterling may end up being the focus given that the main events are a panel appearance from Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane and a speech from deputy governor Ben Broadbent. The former sparked a sterling surge in June after switching from dove to hawk, while the latter is yet to make his stance clear, meaning any rate hike titbits could be of great interest to the pound. Publishing group Pearson has slumped to the bottom of the FTSE 100 fallers, after selling 22% of its Penguin Random House, the world\u2019s biggest publisher, to Bertelsmann. The sale has yielded almost $1bn for Pearson, which is planning to return \u00a3300m to shareholders. The City seems unimpressed with the deal, though, sending Pearson shares down 6.8% to 642p. Sterling has crept higher this morning as traders get ready for Ben Broadbent\u2019s Aberdeen speech to hit the wires at noon precisely. The pound has risen by 0.2% against the US dollar, to $1.2904. It\u2019s up a similar amount against the euro, at \u20ac1.132. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, suspects that Andy Haldane could also lift the pound, if he discusses monetary policy at today\u2019s event on numeracy. She says: Haldane has recently voiced his preference for higher UK rates to cool down the inflationary pressures. His speech could give a boost to the pound-bulls, yet may not suffice to gain over the critical $1.3045 resistance. We have encouraging news from Italy. Italian industrial production rose by 0.7% in May, beating forecasts of a 0.5% rise and reversing April\u2019s 0.5% decline. That\u2019s also better than the UK, where output fell by 0.1% during May. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets is impressed: On an annual basis, output was 2.8% higher than a year ago: In the City, shares in Marks &amp; Spencer have dropped by 1.5% after it released an underwhelming statement ahead of today\u2019s shareholder meeting. M&amp;S reported a 1.2% drop in clothing and home sales in the last quarter, and a 0.1% decline in food sales. The company insists its strategy is \u2018on track\u2019 (it\u2019s trying to wean itself off price cuts, to boost profitability rather than turnover). But analyst Louise Cooper isn\u2019t impressed: Kathleen Brooks of City Index is also concerned that M&amp;S is falling behind other food retailers. The best way to sum up M&amp;S\u2019s Q1 sales was disappointing. Not only did the clothing and homewares sector see another 1.2% drop in sales, the second consecutive decline, but the all-important food sector also saw a decline in sales, dropping 0.1%, whereas estimates had looked for a pick-up of 0.6%. Unsurprisingly, the share price has dropped at the UK open, as investors\u2019 lose confidence in the outlook for the UK high street stalwart. M&amp;S shares are down 5p at 333.4p. Reuters have done a preview of the Ben Broadbent speech: Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent will deliver a speech on Tuesday, giving investors a chance to hear the views of an interest-rate setter who has not yet commented publicly since a narrow vote to keep rates unchanged last month. Broadbent is due to speak in Aberdeen during a regional visit to Scotland, the BoE said in its weekly schedule of speaking events by top officials. Several analysts have said the views of Broadbent - who is deputy governor for monetary policy - will be key to assessing the chances of a first BoE rate hike in a decade. The central bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee split 5-3 as it decided to keep rates on hold at their record low of 0.25 percent last month, a tighter than expected vote. All eight current members of the MPC have spoken since that meeting except for Broadbent and new committee member Silvana Tenreyro who took up her post this month. Ahead of Ben Broadbent\u2019s speech, here\u2019s a reminder of what his colleagues on the Monetary Policy Committee have said recently. Andy Haldane: If the data holds up, there\u2019s a case for withdrawing some stimulus later this year #hawkish Michael Saunders: Households should prepare for interest rates to go up #hawkish Ian McCafferty: A rate rise would be prudent #hawkish Mark Carney: Monetary policy decision depends on how the economy reacts to both tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations #onthefence Sir Jon Cunliffe: We have a bit of time to see how inflation, consumer spending, business investment and exports develop #dovish Gertjan Vlieghe: Rate rise now would be a mistake #dovish Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale agrees that Ben Broadbent\u2019s speech in Aberdeen today could shift the pound, if he drops any interest rate hints: Mr Broadbent is potentially a market-mover as we watch to see if anyone else is switching to a more hawkish bias on UK monetary policy. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. In the battle between hawks and doves at the Bank of England, Ben Broadbent has kept his head down and his cards close to his chest. But that might all change today, when deputy governor Broadbent gives a speech in Aberdeen at noon. Broadbent\u2019s views on interest rate policy could be crucial at the Bank\u2019s next meeting, in August. Economists believe that up to three policymakers could vote for the first interest rate rise in a decade. Three more, including governor Mark Carney, are likely to vote to leave borrowing costs at their current record low of just 0.25%. So that means that Broadbent, and new member Silvana Tenreyro, could swing August\u2019s vote. And excitingly, the public really don\u2019t know what Broadbent thinks about the tricky balancing act facing the Bank of England as it juggles rising inflation, falling real wages, and an economy gripped by Brexit worries. The pound could surge if Broadbent hints at voting for a rate rise, or fall if he says Britain still needs the boost of record low rates. Sam Hill of RBC Capital Markets explains why investors will be watching closely..... At this stage we would anticipate that Mark Carney, Jan Cunliffe and Gertjan Vlieghe will vote for an unchanged Bank Rate at the August meeting, with Andy Haldane, Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty expected to vote for a hike. This has put the focus clearly on Broadbent, whose post-election purdah views remain unknown up to this point. If Broadbent signals his views are more aligned with the hawks, short-term UK interest rate expectations are likely to jump again. Conversely, if the Deputy Governor maintains a balanced emphasis to his comments the risk of a near-term rate hike in the UK should recede a little. However, the views of new MPC member Tenreyro remain unknown, as does the identity of the ninth voter, with the other Deputy Governorship, for Markets and Banking, remaining vacant at this stage following Charlotte Hogg\u2019s departure. Broadbent\u2019s colleague Andy Haldane is also appearing on a panel today, on numeracy (something the BoE\u2019s chief economist should be familiar with....). Haldane shook the City up a few weeks ago by hinting that he could vote for a rate rise soon, so we\u2019ll watch out for any market-moving comments from him today. Also coming up today... Haldane and Broadbent aren\u2019t the only central bankers out and about today. Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 of the European Central Bank is speaking in Frankfurt around lunchtime. High street stalwart Marks &amp; Spencer is holding its annual general meeting today, at Wembley Stadium. Campaigners are likely to lobby the company to start paying the living wage, and to stop advertising in a certain newspaper.... European finance ministers will meet in Brussels today for an Ecofin meeting. They\u2019ll be discussing the EU\u2019s action plan to create a capital markets union, and boost the availability of funding to small firms. We also find out how many job vacancies are available in the US; a good sign of the health of the labour market. In the City, recruitment firm Pagegroup and insurance firm GoCompare are both reporting results. European stock market are expected to open a little higher, with the FTSE 100 tipped to gain just nine points.

World trade had grown very strongly under the classical gold standard, during the second half of the 19th century. The same goes for the capital flows that financed these exchanges. The catastrophes of the world wars, and the intervening Great Depression, put all that into reverse. Partly as a natural consequence of economic contraction, partly thanks to outright protectionism, trade volumes fell sharply between 1914 and 1950, even relative to world GDP. <br></li> <li>Second, although the conditions for a revival began to be laid during the 1950s it wasn\u2019t until the 1960s and early 1970s that trade costs started to fall, and trade intensity to rise, in earnest. In this first phase of (re-)globalisation, during the 1970s and 80s, much of the growth in trade occurred between developed economies.<br></li> <li>Third, there was a further and very marked rise in trade intensity during the 1990s and the early part of the last decade, as developing economies entered the world trading system.<br></li> <li> Finally, you can see clearly how world trade has stalled, relative to GDP, since the financial crisis a decade ago. <br></li> </ol> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5964ccb2e4b08eb8aa037c22\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-11T13:30:59.672Z\">2.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Broadbent speech: snap reaction</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ben Broadbent\u2019s speech is a full-throated defence of the benefits of trade, say City experts.</strong></p> <p><strong>Mohammad Jamei</strong> of UK Finance, the trade body, is tweeting the key points:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mjjamei/status/884763055703433221\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ben Broadbent&#39;s speech on globalisation and Brexit: UK will need to get better at producing stuff it imports (crude materials, live animals) <a href=\"https://t.co/p01cK5L2G3\">pic.twitter.com/p01cK5L2G3</a></p>&mdash; Mohammad Jamei (@mjjamei) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjjamei/status/884763055703433221\">July 11, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mjjamei/status/884763652460597249\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Arguably the most important part of Ben Broadbent&#39;s speech: Brexit likely to reduce UK&#39;s income and raise costs as we lose benefits of trade <a href=\"https://t.co/WDLtjVB5kn\">pic.twitter.com/WDLtjVB5kn</a></p>&mdash; Mohammad Jamei (@mjjamei) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjjamei/status/884763652460597249\">July 11, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>European credit strategist <strong>Tomas Hirst</strong> says Broadbent has shone a light on the problems caused by Brexit</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tomashirstecon/status/884755974925553664\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That Brexit is an act of gross economic self-sabotage not really a matter of contention any more.

Nevertheless, it has allowed for a great deal of specialisation. And if the theme of this talk is that the benefits of trade involve imports as much as they do exports, the same point applies. Put simply, a significant curtailment of trade with Europe would force the UK to shift away from producing the things it\u2019s been relatively good at, and therefore tends to export to the EU, and towards the things it currently imports and is relatively less good at.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also provides this chart , showing how Britain has a \u201ccomparative advantage\u201d in areas like financial services, but not in food and heavy-duty machinery. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a98d9414b6d769e5884c197fc89c0c57adc65f2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a98d9414b6d769e5884c197fc89c0c57adc65f2d/0_0_593_488/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Broadbent's speech\" width=\"500\" height=\"411\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>So if trade links suffer, Britain will make less money from its service sector, and have to replace EU imports with domestic products. At a price.</strong></p> <p>And of course, the same is true of the EU (but on a smaller scale).</p> <p>Broadbent concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All else equal, the first shift (i.e. away from services exports) would tend to lower UK income, the second to raise certain costs (that is, of food and machinery). And, albeit on a smaller scale, relative to their (much larger) GDP, the same would be true for the EU16.</p> <p>Trade really is mutually beneficial and less of it costs us all. That these truths are a couple of centuries old, and not always widely accepted, doesn\u2019t make them any less true.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-07-11T12:52:42.452Z\">at 1.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5964c2c6e4b0aadbb6419bb7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-07-11T12:22:21.355Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Excitement is building in the City as investors await Ben Broadbent\u2019s speech.</strong></p> <p>The pound is a little higher, at $1.2915, up nearly half a cent today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/stewhampton/status/884748739583373312\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tough to see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BOE?src=hash\">#BOE</a> Broadbent deviating from Carney, but, they have been surprising us of late.</p>&mdash; stewart  hampton (@stewhampton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stewhampton/status/884748739583373312\">July 11, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Fxflow/status/884748862874898432\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">GBP starting to move ahead of Broadbent - who is an enigma now.

But that might all change today, when deputy governor Broadbent gives a speech in Aberdeen at noon.</p> <p>Broadbent\u2019s views on interest rate policy could be crucial at the Bank\u2019s next meeting, in August. Economists believe that up to three policymakers could vote for the first interest rate rise in a decade.</p> <p>Three more, including governor Mark Carney, are likely to vote to leave borrowing costs at their current record low of just 0.25%.</p> <p>So that means that Broadbent, and new member <strong>Silvana Tenreyro</strong>, could swing August\u2019s vote.</p> <p>And excitingly, the public really don\u2019t know what Broadbent thinks about the tricky balancing act facing the Bank of England as it juggles rising inflation, falling real wages, and an economy gripped by Brexit worries.</p> <p>The pound could surge if Broadbent hints at voting for a rate rise, or fall if he says Britain still needs the boost of record low rates.</p> <p><strong>Sam Hill</strong> of<strong> RBC Capital Markets</strong> explains why investors will be watching closely.....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At this stage we would anticipate that Mark Carney, Jan Cunliffe and Gertjan Vlieghe will vote for an unchanged Bank Rate at the August meeting, with Andy Haldane, Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty expected to vote for a hike.</p> <p>This has put the focus clearly on Broadbent, whose post-election purdah views remain unknown up to this point. If Broadbent signals his views are more aligned with the hawks, short-term UK interest rate expectations are likely to jump again. Conversely, if the Deputy Governor maintains a balanced emphasis to his comments the risk of a near-term rate hike in the UK should recede a little.</p> <p>However, the views of new MPC member Tenreyro remain unknown, as does the identity of the ninth voter, with the other Deputy Governorship, for Markets and Banking, remaining vacant at this stage following Charlotte Hogg\u2019s departure.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Broadbent\u2019s colleague Andy Haldane is also appearing on a panel today, on numeracy (something the BoE\u2019s chief economist should be familiar with....). </strong></p> <p>Haldane shook the City up a few weeks ago by hinting that he could vote for a rate rise soon, so we\u2019ll watch out for any market-moving comments from him today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jun/21/oil-price-markets-public-finances-ftse-pound-business-live\">Pound jumps after Haldane turns hawkish and UK deficit falls \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Also coming up today...</h2> <p>Haldane and Broadbent aren\u2019t the only central bankers out and about today. <strong>Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9</strong> of the <strong>European Central Bank</strong> is speaking in Frankfurt around lunchtime.</p> <p>High street stalwart <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer </strong>is holding its annual general meeting today, at Wembley Stadium.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor is being asked to reassure parliament that he will recover any monies lost to aggressive tax avoidance in the recruitment sector, after a Guardian investigation exposed how millions of pounds could be lost to the exchequer. Frank Field MP, who is due to be reconfirmed as the chairman of the House of Commons work and pensions select committee on Wednesday, is also asking the Treasury if it has calculated the impact on tax revenues of the liquidation of companies linked to Anderson Group, one of the recruitment sector\u2019s leading financial services firms that promoted a scheme where almost 2,000 mini companies are now being simultaneously wound up. In a series of parliamentary questions on the subject, Field asked: \u201cWhat assessment has [the chancellor] made of HMRC\u2019s ability to investigate and recover tax revenue lost to aggressive tax avoidance schemes promoted by the Anderson Group and others?\u201d He also asked: \u201cWhat assessment [the chancellor] has made of the impact of the mass liquidation of mini companies associated with the Anderson Group on tax revenue?\u201d The move by Field comes after the latest expos\u00e9 on this type of scheme, designed to save tax by setting up thousands of tiny firms to exploit VAT and national insurance rules that were originally designed to help very small businesses. The arrangements were supposed to work by transferring contracts of low-paid workers from a single large employment agency into a web of tiny companies. So, if an employment agency previously supplied a warehouse with 300 workers, the scheme\u2019s promoters might create 150 new companies, each employing two workers. Many of those mini companies linked to Anderson were put into voluntary liquidation at the end of 2016 \u2013 a move that post-dated HMRC\u2019s fraud and investigation service asking the company for details about the large numbers of VAT registration applications made on behalf of its clients. Tax experts, who questioned if the structure of the Anderson scheme might trigger a possible criminal investigation, also told the Guardian that the mass liquidation makes it extremely difficult to pursue the defunct firms for any potential VAT or national insurance debt \u2013 particularly as each mini company appears to only have a Philippines-based director and barely any retained assets. Anderson Group did not respond to an invitation to comment on Field\u2019s questions.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bars, pubs and restaurant chains are pulling back on expansion and may close outlets amid big rises in food and drink costs. Food price inflation for licensed businesses is running at 9% according to the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers, while drink costs are rising by up to 7%, partly as a result of the fall in the value of the pound since last year\u2019s Brexit vote. Those price rises have combined with increased costs from the introduction last year of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d for over-25s, as well as rising business rates and mandatory pension contributions to pile pressure on hospitality businesses. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of the ALMR, which represents 90% of restaurants, pubs and bars, said the businesses were coming under pressure as only 4% felt they could pass on cost increases to their customers through higher prices. \u201cThere is a real reluctance to increase prices to the consumer for fear of damaging fragile discretionary spend,\u201d Nicholls told the Food and Drink Federation convention at the British Museum in London. \u201cThere is a risk that additional costs could hit at a time of great instability hitting eating and drinking out businesses that are crucial to the UK economy and have helped restore prosperity to our town and city centres.\u201d Concerns about rising costs combined with a drop in drinking and dining out have led to plummeting business confidence. Before the Brexit vote 84% of ALMR\u2019s members were optimistic about their own businesses, a figure that has fallen to 47% . \u201cUncertainty is the new norm,\u201d Nicholls said. \u201cWe are starting to see people go bust. There is a very febrile atmosphere at the moment.\u201d She said businesses had already begun closing outlets or reining in expansion. London-based Affinity Bars &amp; Restaurants closed its four pubs this month, while burger chain Handmade Burger Co went into administration last week and rival Byron is reportedly considering shutting four of its restaurants. The celebrity chef Jamie Oliver closed six restaurants in the wake of the Brexit vote. However, there was also a positive note with nightclubs experiencing 3.6% sales growth after a period of decline, according to the ALMR Christie &amp; Co benchmarking report released on Tuesday. Nicholls said businesses had to increase sales at existing outlets by 5% to 6% a year just to cope with increasing costs and so were increasingly under pressure. Two-thirds of ALMR\u2019s members had already been adversely affected by the fall in the value of sterling. Nearly 30% more said they expected adverse affects this year. She said uncertainty about the future as the UK negotiates its exit from the EU was making it difficult for the many chains backed by foreign private equity money to plan ahead. Availability of labour is a particular concern. About half of the hospitality industry\u2019s workforce comes from overseas and more than a quarter are non-UK EU nationals. The balance varies by role, with 42% of chefs from overseas compared with 35% of restaurant managers, 29% of waiters and 13% of bar staff. In London and the south-east, 70-80% of hospitality workers come from overseas. Nicholls said that with nearly full employment, this was \u201cnot a skills shortage, it\u2019s a labour shortage\u201d and government needed to give confidence about future access to workers. She said it would take three to 10 years for businesses to adapt if access to EU workers was cut off after Brexit.",

In the run-up to last year\u2019s referendum, Jamie Dimon had warned that up to 4,000 roles would be at risk in the event of a vote to leave. Speaking at a conference in Paris on Tuesday, Dimon said the initial response would require several hundred jobs to go \u2013 but the final number would depend on the demands imposed by the EU\u2019s regulators and politicians. Some 16,000 staff are employed by JP Morgan in the UK \u2013 including 4,000 in Bournemouth \u2013 and around 75% of the business they conduct is for EU companies, Dimon said. Dimon said JP Morgan had to be ready for hard Brexit \u2013 whether it was likely to happen or not. \u201cIt\u2019s easy we plan for that ... all it means is that several hundred jobs have to legally be done through an EU sub[sidiary],\u201d he added. He said JP Morgan could handle most of its activities this through its existing operations in the EU in Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg. The bank is buying a landmark office block in Dublin that could house 1,000 staff, double its current workforce in the Irish capital. Dimon said: \u201cPeople should focus more on the second step ... What happens next is totally up to the EU.

      "bodyText": "Struggling fashion chain Store Twenty One is being liquidated with the loss of 900 retail jobs. The value clothing retailer, which was based in Solihull in the West Midlands, has entered compulsory liquidation and its 122 stores which ceased trading on Friday will not reopen. The company had been in a precarious financial situation since April when HM Revenue &amp; Customs issued a winding-up notice over unpaid tax. Store Twenty One, which was owned by Indian textiles company Alok Group, had a chequered financial history and had struggled to adapt as low-cost fashion rivals such as Primark expanded across the UK.

      "bodyText": "After nine months of study and a road trip around British towns and cities being transformed for better and worse by rapid changes in the way we work, the government\u2019s employment reviewer, Matthew Taylor, has grasped one nettle, if not the whole bunch. The Trades Unions Congress is disappointed there is little in the former Blair adviser\u2019s recommendations to act against job insecurity which affects millions of workers who are in self-employment or on zero-hours contracts. A right for agency workers to request fixed hours when they have been engaged with the same hirer for 12 months is something. But millions will still fear the loss of their work at a moment\u2019s notice, even as they may enjoy the flexibility of being able to work when they want. And he has not blown away the uncertainties of a working life spent in the so-called \u201cgig economy\u201d whose workers now number about 1.1 million. He has disappointed trade unions by not demanding full employment rights for people who work for companies such as Uber and Deliveroo. Instead, he has argued for the innovation and flexibility that both zero-hours and gig economy work, at their best, can enable. Exhausted warehouse workers on zero-hours terms may raise their eyebrows at that. On the plus side, he has made a strong case for Theresa May\u2019s government to finally redress a widely felt imbalance between poor workers and rich investors in some of the most highly valued and profitable companies in the world. As the Guardian has charted, too many supposedly self-employed workers for companies such as Uber and Deliveroo and others including the delivery firms Hermes, DPD and UK Mail, have complained of low pay, insecurity and harsh treatment in business models that rely on self-employed labour to deliver cheaper services to consumers, higher profits to employers and tougher conditions for many workers. Without sounding the death knell for the gig economy as we know it, he has done two things of merit to tackle these problems. The first is to urge the government to enact primary legislation which will mean any self-employed workers who are under \u201ccontrol\u201d or \u201csupervision\u201d from their contracting company should be considered a \u201cdependent contractor\u201d. That means they should receive holiday pay and sick pay, and, in most cases, wages that equate to at least the national minimum wage. This boundary between self-employment and worker status has been blurry and has recently been redefined by employment tribunals rather than parliament. Uber last year lost a case brought by two drivers, James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, who claimed they were not genuinely self-employed. The tribunal was damning in its verdict and was clear that these Uber drivers at least should be guaranteed the minimum wage and other basic employment rights. But Uber is appealing. Among other things it points out the potential absurdity of moving from paying drivers on a piece work basis to an hourly minimum wage rate if a driver logs on in the middle of the night and there are no fares, or if he or she logs on and decides not to take those fares. And what if a driver logs on at the same time to drive for Uber and also deliver takeaways for Deliveroo? Who should be paying the minimum wage? These technology companies are labelled \u201cdisruptive\u201d for a reason. Such knotty problems aside, a new law drafted as Taylor intends is likely to give tens of thousands of gig economy workers greater benefits in terms of sick pay and holiday. That will come at a cost. Gig economy companies privately estimate it will add about 20% to employment costs. Pricier minicab rides and more expensive takeaway deliveries may loom unless these firms\u2019 venture capitalist backers change their spots and absorb the loss. Consumers may feel that is a fair price to pay if workers get a better deal, given the services they provide often seem cheap. Taylor is also trying to slice through the complex question of how to guarantee the minimum wage on platforms that are set up to pay on a piece-work rate. This will be harder. He wants companies using \u201cdependent contractors\u201d to be exempt from facing demands for the minimum wage only if they can fulfil three commitments. The first is to show the average worker would receive at least 1.2 times the minimum wage. The second is that workers have the freedom to clock on and clock off when they like and the third is that the gig economy company provides real time information about how much a worker can expect to earn when they clock on. Taylor has accepted that they cannot be expected to face minimum wage claims from workers clocking on at times of extremely low demand, as long as they are told their earnings are likely to be low. Unions understandably disagree. Anyone working, at any time should receive the minimum wage, they believe. But to do so could mean gig firms including Uber and Deliveroo moving to shift work \u2013 setting shifts at the busiest times to guarantee sufficient revenue to pay the wages and still make the profits their investors want. Workers who require greater flexibility and consumers who want access to services 24/7 would lose out. Taylor clearly thinks they should not. We must not assume Taylor\u2019s proposal for a clearer definition of \u201cdependent workers\u201d will be easy to bring into law. For example, the question of how to legislate for employers to model average pay across a diverse workforce looks fraught for dispute and would need to be tightly policed. HMRC already takes months and sometimes years to resolve questions about whether workers are bogusly self-employed. As Phil Allen, a partner and employment law specialist at Weightmans, puts it: \u201cRelabelling workers as dependent contractors won\u2019t achieve anything if the distinction between the categories remains as difficult to pin down.\u201d Even if Taylor\u2019s reforms are implemented, gig economy workers will still number among the \u201cprecariat\u201d, and that remains a problem not just for those people who will continue to struggle to plan their lives beyond the medium term. It stores up political problems too. We have seen the impact of disenfranchised workers on US electoral politics. Government planners will also be concerned at a lack of retirement savings in this growing group. On the gig economy, Taylor has sought to resolve some glaring injustices and will win some praise for that, even if the overall ambition he sets out that \u201call work in the UK economy should be fair and decent with realistic scope for development and fulfilment\u201d remains laudable but less obviously achievable.",

      "bodyText": "Mohaan Biswas, 24, Deliveroo motorbike courier Biswas has worked for Deliveroo since February last year. \u201cI just wanted to find a job where I was riding my bike,\u201d he says. Initially he was paid \u00a37 an hour plus \u00a31 per delivery, as well as petrol and about \u00a315 in tips a week. Now he gets \u00a33.75 per delivery. He reckons both work out at about \u00a310 an hour but he\u2019s only been on the drop rate for a short time. While this sounds a good rate of pay, well above the minimum wage, Biswas is a self-employed independent contractor so he doesn\u2019t receive sick pay, holiday pay or anything towards the cost of maintaining or insuring his motorbike. Biswas bought his own bike which cost about \u00a32,500 and he pays about \u00a3100 a month for insurance. He lives with his parents and so has relatively cheap living costs. But with the bike and insurance costs to cover he has only taken a week\u2019s holiday and a few odd days off in the past year. He also had two weeks off sick after an accident. \u201cYou can make an all right living from it but if you have an accident you stand alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI live with my family so when it happened to me I had support, but not from Deliveroo.\u201d Biswas injured his knee making a delivery. He finished the delivery but ended up going to hospital where he was told he needed to take two or three weeks off work. \u201cI took two weeks off but then I needed to go back to make money,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no sick pay, no holiday pay.\u201d When he took six days off for a holiday earlier this year, he said: \u201cIt left me financially messed up. It used up all my money.\u201d Biswas now works 30 to 40 hours a week. He used to do about 55 hours a week, but says: \u201cIt takes it toll, I couldn\u2019t keep it up. You are riding around the City of London and it\u2019s stressful \u2013 these roads are mad.\u201d He also works for UberEats and BuzzHire, and says he has to do so to get enough work. The flow of work is erratic. There can be times when he earns a lot, with as many as five or six orders in an hour, and other times when he can sit about with no work, and no pay, for several hours. But he says he doesn\u2019t feel like an independent freelance. \u201cThey do exercise control over us,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an illusion of freedom. When you start, you feel the phone is the boss and no one is watching you, but you quickly realise they are watching and if you don\u2019t do things their way there are consequences.\u201d He says that when he first started drivers received regular assessments showing how they were doing against performance metrics. Now they don\u2019t receive this information but drivers still assume these metrics are being watched and those that don\u2019t meet company targets lose hours. \u201cYou are constantly being measured by your phone,\u201d he says. Biswas knows people who have suddenly lost hours or premium pay for training other riders for example, when they have not gone along with new edicts from Deliveroo. \u201cAs soon as they make a decree it happens. You are subject to their whim,\u201d he says. A Deliveroo spokesperson said: \u201cRiders receive around \u00a39.50 per hour on average across the UK, well above the national minimum wage. This rises to \u00a312.00 per hour for riders on the fully flexible fee per delivery model. Riders on both the hourly payment model and the fee per delivery model receive their fees in full and all tips from customers. We take no commission. \u201cDeliveroo riders value and enjoy the flexible well-paid work which we offer. 84% of our riders are happy or very happy working with us, and we receive 10,000 rider applications every week.\u201d A former van driver for UK Express, a delivery company which works for Parcelforce, who spoke anonymously As a self-employed driver for UK Express, the driver\u2019s weekly earnings varied widely \u2013 from a loss of \u00a3200 to a profit of \u00a31,200 in his best ever week. His average take-home pay, after paying van hire fees, insurance and petrol, was about \u00a3250 a week. It\u2019s difficult to say how much this was per hour, he says, as he often slept in his van \u2013 at a destination where he had done a delivery \u2013 before doing a return run later. This was a regular, and expected, part of the work. As an independent contractor, he did not get sick pay or holiday pay and had to continue to pay van hire fees and insurance even when not working. After months on the job, he recently quit after the company said it wanted drivers to take out their own insurance on top of van hire fees. UK Express also asked drivers to become a limited company and to hire their own replacement if they were off work. They could ask UK Express to find a replacement but would have to \u201ccall in to get a price\u201d for that. Van hire, which had to be done via a specific company, was \u00a3318 a week including insurance. Drivers also bought their own petrol. The driver said fuel bought with a card provided by the company was about 20% more expensive than if it was bought directly. The vans use up to \u00a3100 of fuel a day, so paying for it can add up to a serious chunk of pay. Because drivers are paid per mile, longer journeys are profitable but short trips are not. \u201cIf you drive Coventry to Aberdeen three times a week you can get \u00a31,800 and spend half of that on fuel and the van,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s decent money, but the chances of you getting that are low.\u201d Trips are allocated by central controllers and they can penalise those who have not toed the line and tend to award regular long trips to old favourites. \u201cThe work you get is up to the mood of the controller \u2013 four lads in an office,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you upset them you get nothing or little allocations or short distances where you don\u2019t make money.\u201d \u201cSeveral times they told me \u2018you might as well hand the keys back in\u2019 \u2013 they threaten you with that or ignore you if you refuse to do the jobs they want.\u201d For some it can be hard to turn the keys in. New drivers are only given low driving hours and short journeys so once they have paid for the van and fuel they can easily find themselves in debt and having to work very long hours to try and pay that off. Administration fees levied by UK Express can also add heavily to costs. When he got a \u00a330 parking ticket, the driver who spoke to the Guardian not only had to pay the fine but also a \u00a336 admin charge on top. Another time, the van\u2019s tamper alarm was triggered when the driver was sleeping in it. He missed a call from UK Express\u2019s coordinators asking him to report in urgently and was charged a \u00a399 fee. After a lengthy dispute, the driver eventually managed to claim that money back. \u201cIf you don\u2019t check the invoices they sneak things on the bottom,\u201d he says. \u201cLots of guys don\u2019t speak great English and have difficulty knowing what these things are and challenging them.\u201d UK Express had not responded to a request for comment by the time of publication. Care worker, 30, based near Middlesbrough, who spoke anonymously The worker is employed by a private care company helping mainly elderly clients with their medication and care, including food preparation, bathing and dressing, household chores and moving about, such as helping people out of wheelchairs and into bed. She earns \u00a37.80 an hour but this is only for the hours she works dealing with clients. She does not get paid for travel time between jobs and no travel time is included in her rota. Some journeys can take more than 10 minutes so that time comes off the time spent with clients. In practice, to do the job properly, good care workers end up starting their day 15 minutes early \u2013 the earliest time they are allowed to turn up at a client\u2019s house, leaving their last job late and working through unallocated time in their daily schedule. This can mean that our care worker can earn less than the national minimum wage, if travel time is included. If a client needs more time than necessary, care workers don\u2019t get paid extra. She can only ask for extra if there has been an emergency and a doctor or ambulance has to be called, for example. If someone is just not out of bed when they should be, or is more confused or unwell that day and so needs more time to bathe or take their medicine, the care worker has the choice of not doing the job properly or being underpaid. \u201cAll [care workers] I know would never leave a service user in a difficult position but at the same time it is frustrating that to do a job well and look after people in a way that is complete you have to work for free,\u201d she says. Her pay and weekly rota can be very changeable. The care worker is on a zero-hours contract and so is not guaranteed any working hours a week. In practice she usually works about 25 hours a week but hours can change week to week. If a client suddenly goes into hospital or dies she can lose hours or she can suddenly be called in to do extra work. She\u2019s now looking for a different job as she\u2019d like to progress in her career, earn more, get a pension and guaranteed hours but continue to work in caring for people. It\u2019s also difficult to save money. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to set up any direct debits for an amount of money because you don\u2019t know how much you are going to get at the end of the month and whether it\u2019s going to cover your costs.\u201d \u201cIf I had guaranteed hours when I ask the bank for a mortgage they might give you the time of day at least.\u201d As she is on a contract, she gets basic sick pay but it can be difficult to claim. After each period off work, it\u2019s necessary to have a \u201cback to work\u201d interview at the care company\u2019s head office which is more than 10 miles away with no direct public transport. She does receive holiday pay, but the rate is based on the hours worked in the previous week. If you work fewer hours than usual that week you get less holiday pay. Time off can also be difficult to book. You have to inform the company six weeks in advance and go to the head office to pick up or file forms. \u201cThe flexibility has been really good in the last couple of years as I have had to look after my grandmother,\u201d she says. \u201cBut going forward I want a secure job and to be earning better money.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Black cab turns green as all-new electric London taxi launches", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The maker of the London black cab has unveiled the new, electric design of the car, which will hit the capital\u2019s roads in November and which it hopes to sell to pollution-blighted cities worldwide. Known as the London Taxi Company since 1948, the firm will rebrand as the London Electric Vehicle Company (LEVC) to export the new model, which runs for about 70 miles off a battery before switching to a petrol engine for up to 400 miles. Chris Gubbey, the chief executive of the firm, which was bought by Chinese automotive giant Geely in 2013, said he expected older diesel models would soon face a ban from politicians and regulators concerned about air quality. \u201cThey [diesel cabs] will disappear, this is the way forward. [But] that won\u2019t be as immediate as people think,\u201d he said. Gubbey hopes to have up to 150 of the TX cabs on the capital\u2019s streets by the year\u2019s end, after the first deliveries begin in November. Under Transport for London (TfL) rules, all new black cabs from 1 January 2018 will need to be electric, or capable of producing zero emissions. Combined with an age limit for the cabs of 15 years, that means the last diesel ones should disappear from London by 2032. LEVC thinks that the new cab will be able to compete in a world of Prius-owning Uber drivers, arguing that it offers customers a premium service. \u201cThere\u2019s always been a place for private hire and a premium product. [But] you can\u2019t rest on your laurels and say I\u2019m ringfenced,\u201d he said, adding that the company had not done a good enough job in the past of explaining why its cabs were functionally better. LEVC said the private hire vehicle finance for the model would be higher than previous versions but this would be offset by lower running costs, including a claimed \u00a3100 less on weekly fuel costs. It said the cars would also need less maintenance. Alan Filsell, a 61-year-old black cab driver dropping off a fare in central London, liked the new design but was unconvinced about its cost. While the company would not disclose the pricing for the TX, Filsell said: \u201cThey\u2019re talking to us about \u00a350,000 [for the new car]. These are about \u00a343,000,\u201d he said of the TX4 he was driving. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than a mortgage. They [other cab drivers] reckon if the batteries go wrong, it\u2019ll cost \u00a38,000. I do like the look of it, don\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d Filsell also questioned where the new electric model would be charged up, and said a fare to Heathrow and the drive back would wipe out most of the battery\u2019s range. There should be 80 charging points dedicated to black cab drivers by the start of next year, built by T fL and other groups. The number is expected to rise to 150 by the end of 2018, and to 300 by 2020. The average driver of a black cab covers 120 miles in a day, so most of the time the car would be running without emissions, off the battery. The electric motor will also, eventually, mean an end to lines of idling black cabs belching out toxic fumes at train stations. The final design, unveiled in London, was inspired by the FX4 black cabs built until 1984 \u2013 the one usually reproduced as toys and souvenirs. Described as \u201ccontemporary\u201d but \u201ctimeless\u201d, the curves of the final car were settled on after the designers rejected initial, boxier concepts as well as wackier, futuristic designs. In London, the car will have to compete against Mercedes Benz\u2019s \u00a347,000 London Vito Taxi, an alternative to the traditional black cab that went on sale in January. Although not an electric vehicle like the TX, the diesel car is marketed to cabbies as a fuel efficient option. LEVC is also eyeing an international market for the cabs, made at its \u00a3325m factory in Coventry, as cities across Europe and beyond impose stricter vehicle standards to cut air pollution. On Tuesday, the firm announced it had already received an order for 225 of the cars from the Amsterdam taxi operator, RMC. Anna Jones, a clean air campaigner at Greenpeace, said: \u201cThe UK should be proud of having produced the London EV Company, and its progressive attitude towards cleaning our air and reducing emissions. \u201cThe tide is turning on diesel, and now is the time for the car industry as a whole to fully embrace new electric technology in order to stay relevant and competitive.\u201d",

Combined with an age limit for the cabs of 15 years, that means the last diesel ones should disappear from London by 2032.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aad2d90058f21892e3d3a0e92a3a09223bb39357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aad2d90058f21892e3d3a0e92a3a09223bb39357/0_158_4746_2849/1000.jpg\" alt=\"London electric black cab\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London electric black cab</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>LEVC thinks that the new cab will be able to compete in a world of Prius-owning Uber drivers, arguing that it offers customers a premium service.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always been a place for private hire and a premium product. [But] you can\u2019t rest on your laurels and say I\u2019m ringfenced,\u201d he said, adding that the company had not done a good enough job in the past of explaining why its cabs were functionally better.</p> <p>LEVC said the private hire vehicle finance for the model would be higher than previous versions but this would be offset by lower running costs, including a claimed \u00a3100 less on weekly fuel costs. It said the cars would also need less maintenance.<br></p> <p>Alan Filsell, a 61-year-old black cab driver dropping off a fare in central London, liked the new design but was unconvinced about its cost.</p> <p>While the company would not disclose the pricing for the TX, Filsell said: \u201cThey\u2019re talking to us about \u00a350,000 [for the new car]. These are about \u00a343,000,\u201d he said of the TX4 he was driving. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than a mortgage. They [other cab drivers] reckon if the batteries go wrong, it\u2019ll cost \u00a38,000. I do like the look of it, don\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Filsell also questioned where the new electric model would be charged up, and said a fare to Heathrow and the drive back would wipe out most of the battery\u2019s range.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"650a2f3a28478ea67816049d46135306ecb694b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/650a2f3a28478ea67816049d46135306ecb694b3/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cabbie\u2019s command console\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cabbie\u2019s seat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LVEC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There should be 80 charging points dedicated to black cab drivers by the start of next year, built by T fL and other groups.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has said she will aim to improve rights for those working in the gig economy but fell short of promising legislation to tackle the problem, as she gave a speech aimed at relaunching her faltering leadership. The prime minister said it was important to make sure \u201call work is fair and decent\u201d, speaking at the launch of a new report on modern working practices by Matthew Taylor, a former policy adviser to Tony Blair. She said the government would carefully study his recommendations, which include ensuring workers in the gig economy have sick and holiday pay, the possibility of a higher minimum wage for non-guaranteed hours and a new definition of \u201cdependent contractors\u201d to stop companies wrongly claiming their workers are self-employed. However, she did not promise to implement all his ideas and stressed the importance of enforcing existing legislation and cooperation by companies, implying she may first go down a route of persuading business to change its practices voluntarily. She defended the continuation of zero-hours contracts, which Labour has pledged to abolish, saying the UK could not turn the clock back on new working practices. May said she believed most businesses treated their workers not just fairly but well, adding the aim was \u201cnot overburdening with regulation while making sure people have the rights and protections they need\u201d. The gig economy refers to workers for companies such as Uber and Deliveroo who are treated as self-employed and can therefore earn less than the minimum wage. May\u2019s speech was intended to refresh her struggling tenure in No 10 and show she is serious about domestic policy reform after she lost her majority at the election. She said she wanted to work more on a cross-party basis, challenging her political rivals to contribute ideas and back government proposals that they agree with, reflecting the new political reality of her minority administration. However, the Taylor report was criticised by Labour and trade unions for not going far enough to promise concrete changes in conditions for those working in the gig economy. One of the review\u2019s more controversial recommendation is for firms to pay workers less than the minimum wage during periods of slow business as long as they can prove that they are getting 1.2 times the minimum wage overall. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, rejected the proposal and revealed that she boycotts Uber, the ride-hailing firm because of its business practices. \u201cI don\u2019t personally use Uber because I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s morally acceptable, but that\u2019s not to say that they can\u2019t reform their practices,\u201d Long-Bailey said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way that they are exploiting their workers, and I think the recent case proved that in the courts; that suggested that the workers that were there were in fact workers, and they weren\u2019t flexible workers, and they needed to be given the adequate amount of protection and rights that workers enjoy,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. The Taylor report also said the government should endorse certain electronic payment platforms to encourage the move to a cashless economy. It suggested that use of approved methods could be made a condition of migrant workers\u2019 visas, to prevent them from taking cash payments for jobs. Jeremy Corbyn said it was \u201cobviously\u201d wrong to pay in cash as a way to avoid tax. The Labour leader said he would like to see the practice phased out. However, a Downing Street spokeswoman said she was not aware of any work within government to make Britain a cashless economy, adding that cash-in-hand payments would remain a \u201clegitimate\u201d way of settling bills. Tim Roache, the general secretary of GMB, said the aim of the Taylor review was laudable but that it was a \u201cdisappointing missed opportunity\u201d. \u201cEveryone can pay lip service to wanting good quality, well-paid work but employers could offer that right here and now, they simply choose not to,\u201d he said \u2013 claiming the exploitation of insecure workers was a deliberate part of company business models. \u201cThey won\u2019t decide to do so just because they\u2019re asked nicely. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a quirk of the system, this is the system \u2013 and without regulation this system will inevitably continue.\u201d Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, had a more positive response to some elements of the report, saying its ideas for a new minimum wage for overtime could have more far reaching benefits. \u201cWhile much of the focus has been on relatively small shifts on the gig economy, the review\u2019s most radical proposal would actually have far more impact in traditional sectors such as retail and social care,\u201d Bells said. \u201cA new minimum wage for overtime, forms of which already operate in the US and Australia, would be a big change for low earning workers struggling with tight budgets and insecure earnings. \u201cThe boldness on overtime contrasts with a timid right for zero hour contract workers to request guaranteed hours, something that can all too easily be rejected by employers.\u201d In a statement, Andrew Byrne, Uber\u2019s head of policy, said its average drive took home well over the national living wage after costs. \u201cThe main reason why people say they sign up to drive with Uber is so they can be their own boss. With our app drivers are totally free to choose if, when and where they drive with no shifts or minimum hours. We would welcome greater clarity in the law over different types of employment status,\u201d he said. \u201cDrivers using Uber made average fares of \u00a315 per hour last year after our service fee and, even after costs, the average driver took home well over the National Living Wage. We know drivers want more security too which is why we\u2019re already investing in discounted illness and injury cover, and will be introducing further improvements soon.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Camden Town, Goose Island, Blue Point, Meantime, Hop House 13, Blue Moon, Sharp\u2019s Doom Bar, Lagunitas and London Fields. This pub cellar\u2019s worth of beer brands have one thing in common: they are widely perceived as \u201ccraft\u201d brews but are actually owned by multinational companies. To some drinkers, the company behind the pint does not matter, as long as what is in the glass slakes the thirst and greases the wheels of social interaction. However, the Society of Independent Brewers (Siba) begs to differ. The usually good-natured trade body for Britain\u2019s craft brewers has turned from mild to bitter, with Carlsberg\u2019s takeover of the London Fields brewery proving the final straw. Deals such as these, said chief executive Mike Benner, are \u201cmade in the hope of capturing the original customers and target market of an established, previously independent craft beer brewery\u201d. These customers, he said, were won \u201con the back of the brewery being relatively small, independent and brewing quality, flavoursome beer\u201d. Benner added: \u201cConsumers deserve to know that what they are buying is a genuine craft-brewed beer as research clearly shows that most beer drinkers believe craft beer to be produced by relatively small, independent brewers.\u201d These scathing comments come amid an effort by Siba to build a fence around the \u201ccraft\u201d label with the launch of a new kitemarking system, the Assured Independent British Craft Brewer seal. Its criteria are that brewers must produce less than 200,000 hectolitres a year, abide by Siba\u2019s standards of ingredient quality and \u2013 crucially \u2013 be fully independent of any global beer company. It\u2019s the start of a fightback against a perceived effort by big business to appropriate the craft beer revolution. Adopting the maxim that if you can\u2019t beat them you can buy them, a wave of craft beer takeovers engulfed the US first and has now reached Britain. Disapproval among beer purists about this trend began to bubble over when Camden Town Brewery was sold to Budweiser maker AB InBev, in a deal reputedly worth \u00a385m. Self-declared \u201cpunk\u201d beer brand Brewdog, credited by many with putting rocket burners under the UK\u2019s craft beer scene, barked the loudest, pointedly removing Camden from the menu of its network of bars. Just a few months later the Scottish brewer\u2019s own craft credentials were called into question, first via a social media backlash against its legal pursuit of smaller companies and then by its acceptance of a sizeable private equity investment. Yet Brewdog remains very much independent, something one of the British brewing world\u2019s leading lights says is key to maintaining integrity. Justin Hawke, who runs the Bristol-based Moor Beer Company, believes that staying out of the clutches of a major brewer is far more important than some other factors. \u201cFor me size doesn\u2019t matter if the brewery remains independent, in control of its own destiny and maintains quality, flavour and ethos,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cBut when a company is bought, you lose that independence, you lose the ability to control your own destiny. The owning company will take decisions driven by economics and shareholder value that will require you to change your ethos, quality, and flavour.\u201d Camden Town Brewery founder Jasper Cuppaidge has disputed that notion, telling the Guardian that the product could remain unsullied, an autonomous fiefdom within the AB InBev empire. But Hawke does not believe that any business annexed by a global brewing empire can resist pressure to compromise quality and innovation in search of profit. \u201cNo, that\u2019s impossible. There\u2019s no good example of that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sounds nice, it\u2019s a nice thing to tell the owner who\u2019s just given up control so they don\u2019t feel bad about the process. But at the end of the day, we all know where things end up.\u201d Consumers have historically been just as sceptical about the whiff of deception when offshoots of major companies are dressed in artisanal clothing. Coffee lovers who thought they\u2019d discovered a challenger to chains such as Starbucks and Costa when Harris and Hoole hit the high street spat out their macchiatos when they realised it was owned by Tesco. \u201cIf it had been called Tesco Coffee, I wouldn\u2019t have come in,\u201d said one. Animal rights groups urged a boycott of Body Shop when it was bought by L\u2019Oreal, while there were misgivings around Coca-Cola\u2019s purchase of Innocent smoothies and Unilever\u2019s ownership of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice-cream. Siba hopes that its attempt to define and kitemark craft beer will be a weapon against the encroachment of big business. Now it must rely on drinkers to look for its seal of approval, even after the first few pints have started to work their magic. Small beer or Megabrew? Camden Town Brewery \u2013 sold to AB InBev for \u00a385m in 2015. Meantime \u2013 bought by SAB Miller for \u00a350m, then sold to Asahi.
