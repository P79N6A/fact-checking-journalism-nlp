      "bodyText": "The retirement savings of more than four million council workers should be used to fuel a surge in house building in every city, town and village in Britain, an investigation concerning the quantity and quality of new homes has concluded. Six million new homes, the equivalent of 600 new housing estates a year, should be built over the next 20 years using \u00a310bn drawn from struggling local authority pension funds, according to the Future Homes Commission. The commission, a national inquiry established by the Royal Institute of British Architects to investigate the housing crisis, says that investment should be pumped into high-quality designs to end the construction of what have been described as \"rabbit hutch homes. The programme would produce a better return than shares and bonds and would drive the wider economy back towards steady growth, the commission claims. New national minimum standards for internal floor areas, storage, light and noise insulation are needed, the commission says, adding that the huge acceleration in house building would require land \"in or close to virtually every city town and village\". The idea adds to growing interest in Whitehall and in town halls in using the assets of council pension funds, worth more than \u00a3120bn, to help Britain's economic recovery by bankrolling infrastructure projects. However, a survey of 100 local authority funds published by the Smith Institute, a left-wing thinktank, found none of the funds was prepared to accept a lower return in exchange for achieving social benefit. The greater Manchester pension fund last month announced a \u00a325m investment in 240 new homes on sites presented by the council, in a scheme that is thought to be the first of its kind. But most funds have been wary. Ian Greenwood, chairman of the Local Authority Pension Fund forum, said: \"This is people's pensions we are talking about, and if this goes wrong and the councils are called on to provide more money, it will ultimately affect retirement incomes.\" The commission was formed in response to growing concern that ministers in the last two governments had presided over a decline in house building, apparently powerless to increase construction. Last year 113,340 homes were built in Britain, less than at any time since 1923, despite 230,000 new households being formed each year. There is evidence of widespread dissatisfaction among homeowners over design standards. A quarter of buyers are refusing to buy new-built homes, mainly because they are too small, an Ipsos Mori poll has found. New homes in Britain are the smallest in Europe with one bed-flats 20% smaller than equivalent flats in Germany and three-bed houses 16% smaller. The factors causing most dissatisfaction are the lack of storage space, an absence of outdoor areas, the internal layouts and finishes, and the size of rooms, the commission says. The commission took evidence from 140 experts and organisations including councils, Barratt Homes, NatWest bank, the Council for the Protection of Rural England, and the Royal Town Planning Institute. Half of the homes that need to be built every year should be for sale, while the others 150,000 should be for rent, says the report. Sir John Banham, a former chairman of Whitbread, Kingfisher and Tarmac, said: \"I don't think people have comprehended the scale of this. We have got used to moaning about the scale of the crisis that we haven't realised that this represents a huge opportunity.\" The commission found that only 1% of institutional property investments were linked to homes in the UK, compared to the equivalent for the Netherlands of 47%, while France notched up 15% and Germany 13%. The report claims that further investment is undermined by the lack of in-house expertise. It believes the largest 15 funds could pool 15% of their assets (at least \u00a310bn) in an independently managed \"local housing development fund\" which would finance the construction of swathes of new housing for rent and sale. The commission argues that a greater emphasis on well-designed housing would reduce local \"nimby\" opposition and cites a 2011 Policy Exchange survey that found 69% of people saying the quality of homes built in their area was more important than the quantity. Attempts to kickstart housebuilding in Britain have been numerous but unsuccessful. The commission report identifies inter-connected issues that hold back house building, ranging from a lack of mortgage finance for buyers and British pension funds' reluctance to invest in property, to \"onerous\" planning conditions on house builders, and concerns about the design quality of new homes that puts off buyers and leads to planning objections from communities. According to Peter Williams, director of the Cambridge centre for housing policy, the \"sponge effect\", whereby homes are used more intensively, for example, with more adults living with their parents, means the real crisis could be deferred a couple of years. \"If we don't turn the corner in three to four years, we are going to see a sharp rise in levels of homelessness,\" he said. Designs on a home The award-winning design of Mike Hammerton's newly built \u00a3300,000 home in Osbaldwick near York has eased some of the pressures of modern family life. The 51-year-old civil servant moved with his wife, Lorraine, son Chad, 14, and 20-year-old daughter, Claire, from a 1950s semi which they had outgrown. \"We were getting on top of each other,\" Hammerton says. \"We felt we needed the kids to have more privacy and this new development has a dining room on one floor and a living room on another which helps. \"There are three bathrooms too so if our daughter can't afford a house she can have her own floor here. We have to look to the future. There are big rooms, plenty of storage and high ceilings. \"If we become disabled we can fit a lift shaft and the rooms are made so you can get a wheelchair in and out. They have thought of all that.\" The three-bedroom home in the Derwenthorpe development was built by David Wilson Homes for the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust as part of what will eventually be a 540-home development. In a contrasting case, Sarah Althorpe, 35, moved into a new four-bedroom house in Corby in 2007 and was left very dissatisfied. The design of the house, which, she says, has thin walls and bedrooms too small to use, leads her to describe it as \"slap and dash\". She moved in with her partner, Aaron, daughter Olivia, two, and son Reece, six. \"There were damp walls that they'd covered with paint, window panes were scratched, and the front door dropped on its hinges.\" It was difficult to get the builders, a British residential properly developer, to rectify the problems, she says. There were design faults too. \"The only storage is under the stairs so everything gets shoved in there. The smallest bedroom you can barely fit a single bed in. We had my daughter's nursery in there but she had no room to play so we moved her out. \"My son's bedroom is above the garage and is cold in winter and summer. The walls are paper thin and you can hear the shower upstairs when you are in the downstairs living room.\"",

    "webTitle": "George Osborne gives cautious welcome to rise out of recession", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne was given much needed but probably temporary respite as the UK economy raced out of recession, growing 1% in the three months to September, the fastest rate for five years. But the majority of the growth was due to one-off factors, leaving the chancellor to face business and political calls to do more to stimulate growth in the autumn statement in six weeks' time, or risk the economy slipping into recession for a third time in 2013. Government efforts to lift the national mood were also blighted by news of the closure of the Ford Transit plant in Southampton as well as unexpected cuts at the firm's plant in Dagenham. The closures mean the loss of 1,400 skilled jobs. Osborne tried to tread a perilous path between confidence-generating optimism and a premature identification of green shoots, the error perpetrated by previous Tory chancellors. \"If we stick with what we're doing, getting the deficit down, creating jobs, fixing the deep-seated problems in the British economy then I think you can see now that it is going to deliver the kind of underlying prosperity we want to see in this country,\" he said. Nearly 0.7% of the 1% growth was attributed to Olympic ticket sales and activity deferred from the second quarter, when the Diamond Jubilee holiday was held. That left underlying growth at around 0.3% in the quarter, and Treasury was keen to stress this performance was unlikely to be repeated in the coming months, confirming a fragile recovery. The figures also confirm that growth throughout 2012 will have been flat, in contrast to the 0.8% growth predicted by the Office of Budget Responsibility as recently as March. In June 2010 the OBR predicted 2.8% growth this year. David Cameron said the figures showed the economy was on the right track, and repeated his claim that the economy was healing, a phrase that leaves unclear when the patient will be discharged. The business secretary, Vince Cable, struck a more sceptical note, saying: \"This is not recovery in the traditional sense since this is not a recession in the normal sense. It remains a very deep crisis and we are very cautious.\" The better than expected headline growth placed some pressure on Labour to rethink the tone of its attacks on the coalition's fiscal consolidation strategy. The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, ceded little ground, saying the recovery was not sustainable and Osborne was sticking to a plan that is not working. He pointed out: \"Osborne said two years ago the economy would grow by 4.5% over these two years, and it's grown by 0.6%. It's been a fifth of the growth of America or Germany. He said he'd get the deficit down; our borrowing in the first six months of this year is up. And families are really seeing their living standards down, and we've got really high long-term youth unemployment. That is not a working plan.\" Labour is expecting growth to remain weak in 2013 due to consumer indebtedness and low bank lending, as well as the decreasing activity in the eurozone, the UK's main export market. The OBR had predicted investment would rebound from 0.7% this year to 6.4% next year. Will Straw, from the left-of-centre IPPR thinktank, said such optimism seemed \"surprising at the time but now looks extremely unlikely\". He added: \"Over the last year, investment has grown just 0.3% and the government's policy framework is deterring major infrastructure projects in energy generation, rail and airport expansion.\" The figures also showed a continued contraction in construction despite repeated coalition efforts to lift house-building and reform what it describes as a dysfunctional market. The construction industry contracted by 2.5% over the past three months, compared with 3% the quarter before, meaning a year-on-year contraction of over 10%. In a potentially significant policy intervention, the Future Homes Commission, chaired by the former Audit Commission chief John Banham, suggests housebuilding could be tripled if local authority pension funds pooled resources to finance new construction. John Cridland, director general of the CBI, urged the government to do more to lift the economy outside London. He said retailers were having a torrid time and construction companies were in the doldrums, but exporters, both of manufactured goods and the services, were doing really well. \"Balance the whole thing out, to fellow citizens on the street it's just a flat economy\" Cameron was rebuked by Andrew Dilnot, chair of the UK Statistics Authority, for his comments at prime minister's questions on Wednesday. Cameron told MPs the \"good news will keep coming\" on the economy, which was widely construed as him breaking the embargo on today's release of GDP figures. He had access to the numbers 24 hours in advance. Dilnot wrote to Cameron urging him to overhaul the current \"unsatisfactory\" arrangements for pre-releasing statistics. \"It is clear from media reports that, although this may not have been your intent, your remarks were indeed widely interpreted as providing an indication about the GDP figures. The Statistics Authority's position on pre-release access remains clear. We believe the current practices for pre-release access to official statistics are unsatisfactory, not least because they put those who have received such access in a difficult position.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. It was with those words, delivered almost 70 years ago to the day, that Winston Churchill greeted news of Montgomery's victory at El Alamein, a turning point in the second world war. The Conservative party can never get too much of Churchill, so there will be many in the blue half of the coalition who will be hoping that the words are as appropriate for describing the state of the economy today as they were for outlining the global balance of power in late 1942. Make no mistake, news that Britain's economy grew by 1% in the third quarter of 2012 does not mark the end of the downturn that began more than five years ago, even though it is tremendous morale booster for a government that has had its back to the wall in recent months. The Treasury and the Bank of England know the performance of the economy was flattered by one-off factors in the period between July and September, resulting in growth figures that are less good than they look. Over the past 12 months, national output has been flat and remains 3% lower than it was in early 2008. Recovery has been weaker and slower than in any cycle for which reliable records exist, including the Great Depression of the 1930s. It will take another year of robust growth simply to return the economy to where it was during the period of phoney war between the run on Northern Rock in September 2007 and the collapse of Lehman Brothers a year later, and a decade to make up even half the output lost over the past four and a half years. The level of gross domestic product is 13-14% below where it would have been had growth continued at its pre-recession trend of 2.5% a year. Some of that has been lost for good: it will never be recovered. Nor is any minister, least of all George Osborne, willing to say that this is the beginning of the end. There are simply too many things that could wrong \u2013 at home and abroad \u2013 to make that boast with confidence. Not only did the announcement by Ford that it was closing two UK plants take the shine off the GDP announcement, it also underscored the fragility of the productive wing of the economy. Ford's decision chimes with recent business surveys, most of which offered warning signs about a fresh period of weakness in the final three months of 2012. The year started on a weak note, with consumers hammered by high inflation and exports hit by the deepening crisis in the eurozone. In the second quarter, the economy was broadly flat but looked worse than it actually was due to the extra bank holiday granted for the Queen's diamond jubilee. That accounted for all of the 0.4% drop in GDP, and perhaps a little more. Similarly, the third quarter figures released yesterday overstate the strength of the economy, in part because output lost in June was made up in the next two months and in part because there was a boost to growth from the Olympics. The Office for National Statistics estimates that one-fifth of the growth in the last quarter was the result of ticket sales for the Games, but the GDP data also shows an Olympic effect in very strong performance by shops, hotels and restaurants. Overall, output of the service sector \u2013 which accounts for 80% of the economy \u2013 expanded by 1.3% in the third quarter and is now above its pre-recession peak. That is an impressive performance but is unlikely to be repeated soon. As Danny Gabay of Fathom Consulting pointed out, the increase in service sector output during the third quarter of 2012 alone was greater than in the entire period between the Beijing Olympics of 2008 and the second quarter of this year. Wisely, Osborne was careful not to claim the third quarter growth figures as a turning point. The economy remains fundamentally weak, particularly when it comes to exports and investment, the sectors vital for the rebalancing sought by the government. More demand will be sucked out of the economy in 2013 and 2014 than in 2012 as the chancellor's fiscal tightening intensifies. This will be against the backdrop of a global economy in which there is a deepening recession in the eurozone, slowing growth in China and uncertainty about what will happen to the US economy after the presidential election. As things stand, America will wake up on January 1 next year to tax increases and spending cuts worth 4% of GDP, enough to plunge the entire global economy back into recession. Why, then, might this be the end of the beginning? First, there was some genuine growth in the third quarter, even if it was much less than the headline figure suggested. Consumer spending is gently rising, encouraged by falling inflation, compensation payments by banks for mis-sold payment protection insurance and, notwithstanding the Ford job losses, a diminishing threat of unemployment. For the past four years, the Bank of England has been trying to get the economy moving, through record low interest rates, \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing and, more recently its Funding for Lending Scheme. It may be starting to work. There are two other reasons for ministers to be cautiously optimistic. Recessions, even the deep and damaging ones that result from financial crises, don't last for ever. At least, none have until now. Second, the international outlook may be about to improve. America is unlikely to leap off the \"fiscal cliff\" whoever wins next month's election; China's economy appears to be stabilising and there are signs Europe is getting to grips with its problems. Better global news coupled with a pick-up in consumer spending at home may be enough to persuade businesses to take some of their investment projects out of mothballs, providing a second leg to the recovery. Ministers are not banking on any of this. Even in the absence of bad news from the global economy, there is a risk the economy will continue to bump along the bottom. Strong growth in the UK is normally associated with periods when real (inflation adjusted) incomes are rising strongly, and for now prices are still rising faster than wages - albeit by less than they were a year ago. The banking system remains impaired and the housing market will remain in the doldrums until first-time buyers can secure mortgages. This looks the most likely scenario. There is, of course, another possibility: a fresh downturn that would push the UK into an unprecedented triple dip recession. For that to happen, something would have to go seriously wrong over the coming months. Worryingly for ministers, the history of this recession suggests that if something can go wrong, it will. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 October 2102. The original said the collapse of Lehman Brothers came a year earlier than the 2007 run on Northern Rock. That has been corrected to a year later.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of Shire Pharmaceuticals, Angus Russell, is stepping down next April after five years at the helm and will be replaced by a senior Bayer executive. Russell, 56, will leave at the annual meeting after 13 years with the drugs manufacturer, during which he turned the company from a small specialist firm into a FTSE 100 company, focused on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medicines, a lucrative market in the US. Having spent 32 years in the pharmaceutical industry, including at AstraZeneca and ICI, he said he now wanted to spend more time with his family, as well as pursue his charitable interests and non-executive directorships. He got married for the second time last year, leaving him with responsibility for four young children. Russell will be replaced by Flemming Ornskov, chief marketing officer of Bayer's speciality pharmaceuticals business with sales of more than \u20ac10bn in Europe, China and the US. \"He has impressed investors in this role, where he was responsible for the rollout of [blood-thinning pill] Xarelto,\" said analysts at JP Morgan Cazenove. Ornskov previously worked for Merck and Novartis, as well as biotech firms. Analysts at Cowen were surprised by Russell's departure, noting: \"The explanation given is the business is expanding further and more aggressively into international markets in which Ornskov has significant experience. This appears to be sound rationale.\" The news came as Shire's third-quarter sales growth disappointed due to a cut-price version of one of its top-selling ADHD drugs coming onto the market. Missing analysts' expectations, sales at Shire grew by 4% to $1.1bn. Sales of Adderall XR dropped 32% to $102m, which partially offset the 24% rise in sales of Shire's new lead product Vyvanse to $247m. The drug will be called Elvanse when it is launched in Europe. Mick Cooper, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said: \"Shire's growth has slowed because of generic competition to Adderall XR showing that it does face some of the issues facing big pharma. However the underlying growth remains strong and Angus Russell will be leaving Shire in a very strong position.\" Patent expiry on best-selling medicines also continues to haunt AstraZeneca, Britain's second-largest drugmaker, which reported a 19% slide in third-quarter sales. The company said it was hurt by the loss of exclusivity for Seroquel IR, its blockbuster antipsychotic treatment, as well as high blood pressure drug Atacand, antibiotic Merrem, cholesterol drug Crestor in Canada and heartburn pill Nexium in Europe. Revenues fell to $6.7bn (\u00a34.15bn) in the third quarter from $8.2bn a year ago. New chief executive Pascal Soriot, who joined from Roche and suspended share buybacks on his first day in the job, said buying in new treatments would be an important way of rebuilding the pipeline. He added that the recently launched heart drug Brilinta had the potential to do \"far better\", admitting that AstraZeneca had failed to make the most of it. The Frenchman replaced David Brennan, who was ousted by shareholders in the spring amid growing concern about AstraZeneca's thin pipeline of new drugs. Soriot said his priority was to \"restore the company to growth and scientific leadership\" and promised to unveil the results of a strategy review to investors at the end of January. The decision to halt share buybacks is seen as a sign that AstraZeneca is on the prowl for mid-sized to larger acquisitions, with speculation circling around UK group Shire and US firm Forest Laboratories. \"AstraZeneca's key issue remains its shrinking sales line \u2026 impacted heavily by generic losses and with little offset from new products,\" said Mark Clark at Deutsche Bank. \"The results, in our view, appear to put the company on track only to meet the bottom end of its guidance for a low-to-mid teens sales decline for the year and to deliver core earnings per share in the lower half of its $6-6.30 guidance range. This is of little consequence, however, given the overriding importance of the strategy review which is expected to be unveiled in early 2013.",

    "webTitle": "Ford sheds 1,400 jobs as Debenhams announces 1,700 new retail posts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's mixed economic recovery was starkly illustrated on Thursday as Ford closed two sites with the loss of up to 1,400 manufacturing jobs, while Debenhams lifted the mood of embattled high street retailers by announcing plans for 17 new department stores. The contrasting news underlined the difficulties facing George Osborne as he targets a rebalancing that will divert GDP growth away from debt-fuelled spending towards exports. Ford gave a jolt to those plans on Thursday by signalling an end to more than a century of vehicle production in the UK. The US carmaker is closing its Transit van plant in Southampton and a panel-stamping operation in Dagenham next summer, 102 years after starting production of the Model T in Manchester. Ford will still produce and design engines in the UK but the Unite trade union described the shutdowns as \"disgraceful\". Debenhams, meanwhile, reaffirmed the importance of shoppers to Britain's economic health as the UK's second largest department store group pledged to open new sites and hire an extra 1,700 people. The retailer said customers had become acclimatised to the \"new reality\" of an uncertain economic environment, allowing Debenhams to expand aggressively in the UK, while exporting its business model by ramping up foreign store openings. Ford confirmed on Thursday that the economic reality for mass-market car producers is a retrenchment that will cost thousands of manufacturing jobs across the continent, with the US firm shedding 6,200 positions in Europe this week alone. It is the latest mass-market automotive business to restructure its European operations as carmakers seek to eradicate a glut of capacity amid falling sales, which have left manufacturers with too many plants and too little demand. Britain is Ford's largest market for Transits, but the vehicle will now be imported to the UK from Turkey. Unite's general secretary, Len McCluskey, said thousands more jobs could be affected as the closures ripple through Ford's UK supply chain. \"Ford has betrayed its workforce and its loyal customer base. Unite is going to fight these closures,\" McCluskey said. \"This announcement has been handled disgracefully. Only a few months ago, Ford was promising staff a new Transit model for Southampton in 2014. The planned closures will really hurt the local economies and the supply chain will be badly hit.\" Shop stewards representing Ford's 11,500 staff were told the news on Thursday morning by Ford's European boss, Stephen Odell, in a meeting at the company's technical centre in Basildon. Ford said it hoped to reduce the net redundancy total to 1,100 through relocating 300 staff. It said that the Southampton factory and the Dagenham stamping operation \u2013 which makes van panels for Southampton \u2013 had to shut as part of a programme to stem European losses that will cost the company more than $1.5bn (\u00a3930m) this year. Dagenham's engine plant, which is on the same site as the stamping operation, will remain open. Odell said Southampton was shutting because Ford's Transit plant in Kocaeli, Turkey, already has the spare capacity to make the 28,000 vans that were produced on the south coast last year. \"We absolutely believe that we are doing what is necessary for an industry that is significantly over capacity,\" said Odell. He added that it was significantly cheaper to build Transits in Turkey and transport them to the UK than to build and sell them in Britain. Nonetheless, news of the Dagenham closure came as a shock to Ford's staff. One union representative walked out of the Basildon meeting to inform workers at nearby Dagenham, with unconfirmed rumours of a staff walkout on Thursday afternoon. Ford denied that unofficial industrial action had taken place, but confirmed that the entire Dagenham and Southampton workforces had been given the rest of the day off following a staff briefing. Ford said it hoped to achieve the UK staff reductions through a voluntary programme. It employs 500 people at Southampton and 750 at the Dagenham stamping operation, plus 150 support staff. Vince Cable, the business secretary, said the news was \"very disappointing\". He added that the government has awarded Ford a multimillion-pound grant to support the development of the Dagenham engine plant. \"Our priority will be to help the workforce and we will be working with Ford to get them into new jobs as quickly as possible,\" said Cable. Dagenham is the company's biggest UK site, where the majority of the 4,000 staff are involved in diesel engine manufacturing rather than stamping. It also has plants at Bridgend in Wales and Halewood in Merseyside, as well as a technical centre in Basildon, employing a total of 11,500 in the UK. Ford offered guarantees about the future of both Dagenham and Basildon by pledging to invest in the production and design of a new hi-tech, low-carbon diesel engine at both sites. Odell said these commitments were \"significant.\" He added: \"We have made very definite statements about our long-term commitment to engineering, production and powertrain development that go out a long way into the future.\" The Southampton and Dagenham announcements took the number of Ford operations closures to three in two days after the firm announced on Wednesday that it will shut its factory in Genk, Belgium, with the loss of 4,300 jobs. The company said it had to address a capacity glut caused by a 20% fall in industry-wide demand in western Europe since 2007: sales in its main European markets have fallen 12% in the year to date, to 861,000 vehicles. High street stalwart Debenhams gave a more positive view of the economic environment by announcing plans to take its British estate to 171 shops. The store group's chief executive, Michael Sharp, said that retailers were battling against a \"very difficult market\".

The latter has proven to be an important growth market for high-end UK car manufacturers, with Bentley, Mini and Jaguar Land Rover all benefiting from a boom in Chinese demand.",

      "body": "<p>Britain's mixed economic recovery was starkly illustrated on Thursday as Ford closed two sites with the loss of up to 1,400 manufacturing jobs, while Debenhams lifted the mood of embattled high street retailers by announcing plans for 17 new department stores.</p> <p>The contrasting news underlined the difficulties facing George Osborne as he targets a rebalancing that will divert GDP growth away from debt-fuelled spending towards exports.</p> <p>Ford gave a jolt to those plans on Thursday by signalling an end to more than a century of vehicle production in the UK. The US carmaker is closing its Transit van plant in Southampton and a panel-stamping operation in Dagenham next summer, 102 years after starting production of the Model T in Manchester. Ford will still produce and design engines in the UK but the Unite trade union described the shutdowns as \"disgraceful\".</p> <p>Debenhams, meanwhile, reaffirmed the importance of shoppers to Britain's economic health as the UK's second largest department store group pledged to open new sites and hire an extra 1,700 people. The retailer said customers had become acclimatised to the \"new reality\" of an uncertain economic environment, allowing Debenhams to expand aggressively in the UK, while exporting its business model by ramping up foreign store openings.</p> <p>Ford confirmed on Thursday that the economic reality for mass-market car producers is a retrenchment that will cost thousands of manufacturing jobs across the continent, with the US firm shedding 6,200 positions in Europe this week alone.</p> <p>It is the latest mass-market automotive business to restructure its European operations as carmakers seek to eradicate a glut of capacity amid falling sales, which have left manufacturers with too many plants and too little demand.</p> <p>Britain is Ford's largest market for Transits, but the vehicle will now be imported to the UK from Turkey. Unite's general secretary, Len McCluskey, said thousands more jobs could be affected as the closures ripple through Ford's UK supply chain.</p> <p>\"Ford has betrayed its workforce and its loyal customer base. Unite is going to fight these closures,\" McCluskey said. \"This announcement has been handled disgracefully. Only a few months ago, Ford was promising staff a new Transit model for Southampton in 2014. The planned closures will really hurt the local economies and the supply chain will be badly hit.\"</p> <p>Shop stewards representing Ford's 11,500 staff were told the news on Thursday morning by Ford's European boss, Stephen Odell, in a meeting at the company's technical centre in Basildon. Ford said it hoped to reduce the net redundancy total to 1,100 through relocating 300 staff. It said that the Southampton factory and the Dagenham stamping operation \u2013 which makes van panels for Southampton \u2013 had to shut as part of a programme to stem European losses that will cost the company more than $1.5bn (\u00a3930m) this year. Dagenham's engine plant, which is on the same site as the stamping operation, will remain open.</p> <p>Odell said Southampton was shutting because Ford's Transit plant in Kocaeli, Turkey, already has the spare capacity to make the 28,000 vans that were produced on the south coast last year.</p> <p>\"We absolutely believe that we are doing what is necessary for an industry that is significantly over capacity,\" said Odell. He added that it was significantly cheaper to build Transits in Turkey and transport them to the UK than to build and sell them in Britain.</p> <p>Nonetheless, news of the Dagenham closure came as a shock to Ford's staff. One union representative walked out of the Basildon meeting to inform workers at nearby Dagenham, with unconfirmed rumours of a staff walkout on Thursday afternoon.</p> <p>Ford denied that unofficial industrial action had taken place, but confirmed that the entire Dagenham and Southampton workforces had been given the rest of the day off following a staff briefing.</p> <p>Ford said it hoped to achieve the UK staff reductions through a voluntary programme. It employs 500 people at Southampton and 750 at the Dagenham stamping operation, plus 150 support staff.</p> <p>Vince Cable, the business secretary, said the news was \"very disappointing\". He added that the government has awarded Ford a multimillion-pound grant to support the development of the Dagenham engine plant.</p> <p>\"Our priority will be to help the workforce and we will be working with Ford to get them into new jobs as quickly as possible,\" said Cable.</p> <p>Dagenham is the company's biggest UK site, where the majority of the 4,000 staff are involved in diesel engine manufacturing rather than stamping. It also has plants at Bridgend in Wales and Halewood in Merseyside, as well as a technical centre in Basildon, employing a total of 11,500 in the UK.</p> <p>Ford offered guarantees about the future of both Dagenham and Basildon by pledging to invest in the production and design of a new hi-tech, low-carbon diesel engine at both sites. Odell said these commitments were \"significant.\" He added: \"We have made very definite statements about our long-term commitment to engineering, production and powertrain development that go out a long way into the future.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/24/ford-shuts-belgian-factory-uk-unions\" title=\"\">The Southampton and Dagenham announcements took the number of Ford operations closures to three in two days after the firm announced on Wednesday that it will shut its factory in Genk, Belgium, with the loss of 4,300 jobs</a>. The company said it had to address a capacity glut caused by a 20% fall in industry-wide demand in western Europe since 2007: sales in its main European markets have fallen 12% in the year to date, to 861,000&#xa0;vehicles.</p> <p>High street stalwart Debenhams gave a more positive view of the economic environment by announcing plans to take its British estate to 171 shops.

Failing that, a generous welfare state, financed by higher taxes on the more able, would be necessary, though it might have difficulty in attracting electoral support.</p> <p>Ending Poverty (1999) covered the whole world and presciently stressed the importance of good macroeconomic policies in developed countries and good management of the international financial system, as well as the need for increased aid to promote education and industrialisation in developing countries.</p> <p>Robin was best known to economists for his major contribution to our understanding of corporations. His book The Economic Theory of Managerial Capitalism (1964) helped fill a gap in economics in that textbooks assumed that markets were usually supplied by a multiplicity of small firms, even though in reality most output was produced by large firms. It focused on the separation of ownership from management in large firms and on the weakness of shareholder control, which allowed managers considerable discretion.</p> <p>In Robin's view, managers used their discretion primarily to make their firms grow faster than shareholders would prefer, since in larger firms managers get higher salaries and status. He also argued that this was socially desirable: growth-seeking firms make countries grow faster. His work attracted much academic attention, and JK Galbraith's use of it in his 1966 Reith lectures and subsequent book, The New Industrial State, made it known to a wider audience.</p> <p>Since then, economics and the world have moved on, as Robin recognised in a 1998 revision of The Economic Theory of Managerial Capitalism. The existence of large firms is now explained theoretically by their ability to reduce what would otherwise be prohibitive costs of transactions among many small firms. The behaviour of managers is theorised as one of many examples of the problems that arise when principals have to act through agents. The share of managerial remuneration in the form of stock options and bonuses has also been increased, with the aim of aligning the interests of managers more closely with those of shareholders. Stock options have certainly altered managerial behaviour, though not necessarily for the better.</p> <p>Before and after he worked on large firms, Robin's research interests were in macroeconomics and the labour market. In the 1950s he undertook an innovative study of shiftwork. And in 1991 he published a remarkable book, Reconstructing Keynesian Economics with Imperfect Competition, in which he showed how Keynesian macroeconomic theory, of which he was a lifelong advocate, made sense only when combined with the theory of imperfect competition.</p> <p>Both strands of theory were invented in Cambridge in the 1930s, but, as the book intriguingly argues, sexual rivalries among the theorists kept them apart. This book was among the first to include a disk with a simulation model to run on personal computers, of which Robin was an early user.</p> <p>Robin was born in London, where his father was a senior civil servant, and educated at Bedales school, Hampshire, and King's College, Cambridge. His undergraduate studies were interrupted by three years of second world war service as an RAF pilot (achieved by pretending to be older than he was), but he eventually graduated in 1947. After two years in the Treasury and two years with the UN in Geneva, he returned to Cambridge in 1951 as a fellow of King's and a lecturer (later a reader) in the economics faculty, posts he held for the next 25 years. A long series of students, including me, benefited from his lively mind and warm personality \u2013 though his Carnaby Street suits and Mini Cooper S misled some of us into thinking that dons in general were sexy.</p> <p>In 1976, for a mixture of personal and professional reasons, he moved to a chair at the University of Maryland, where for three years he was head of department, and in 1981 to Birkbeck College, University of London, where again he served as head of department and from which he retired in 1987.

    "webTitle": "Costa Coffee drops plans for Totnes outlet after protests", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Costa Coffee has abandoned plans to open a new outlet in the Devon town of Totnes after months of protests by a campaign group. The chain's plans had been approved by the local district council, and the 70-seat outlet had been expected to open this year, but Costa now claims to have \"recognised the strength of feeling\" about its arrival and has decided to pull out. In August Costa told the Guardian that it aimed \"to add to the vibrancy of the town and support the local community \u2026 by adding vibrancy [and] complementing what Totnes currently offers\". Later that month the chain's managing director, Chris Rogers, met Totnes's mayor, Pruw Boswell, and the town's Conservative MP, Sarah Wollaston, both of whom were opposed to Costa's arrival and supportive of the local \"Say no to Costa\" campaign. Costa now says the discussion resulted in its about-turn. \"We had an open and constructive discussion and as a result \u2026 we have carefully considered the points made and decided not to open on Totnes high street,\" said a company statement. A letter signed by all three parties acknowledges Costa's 19 outlets in Devon and their use of milk and food from the county. But it describes Totnes as \"a town with a long and proud history of independent retailers\", which has \"one of the lowest percentages of branded stores of any town of its size in the UK, very few empty shop fronts, as well as a very high proportion of places selling coffee\". Campaigners put the number of coffee-selling businesses in the town \u2013 population 7,500 \u2013 at 42. Totnes is the home of the UK's original transition town project, which is aimed at \"strengthening the local economy, reducing the cost of living and preparing for a future with less oil and a changing climate\", partly via a local currency. The anti-Costa campaign drew much of its energy and nous from the work of Transition Town Totnes. A petition expressing opposition to the chain's arrival collected 5,749 signatures, 75% of which were said to have come from the town or its surrounding areas. Campaigners threatened to greet Costa's opening with a campaign of resistance: among the ideas proposed were encouraging locals to order tap water and drink it as slowly as possible, covering the Costa outlet's exterior in hostile posters, and encouraging a local boycott. The anti-Costa campaigner and Transition Town Totnes action manager Frances Northrop said Costa's decision \"said something about a company actually coming to visit a place and understanding it, rather than sticking a pin in a map\". She added: \"This is a massive achievement, and it could be a turning point in terms of chains getting too big. The idea of communities standing up and saying 'you're not right for us' has now got a lot more traction than it would have had before.\" Costa's statement about Totnes says it is \"proud to be a successful British company employing 10,000 people, the majority of whom are under 25\". It says that \"in all communities in which we operate, we seek to be a force for good, contributing to growth, creating jobs, and supporting the local economy\". The company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Whitbread plc, is now the UK's biggest coffee chain, operating 1,400 outlets. It recently announced plans for 350 more, and its chief executive, Andy Harrison, has talked of increasing the number of branches to as many as 2,000. But the chain's founder, Bruno Costa, who sold the business to Whitbread in 1995, has recently drawn attention to the chain's domination of the coffee shop market. Costa now lives in Purley, Croydon, where Costa has just opened its sixth outlet. \"As far as the coffee business is concerned, like here in Purley, I know it is monopolised by these three or four companies that don't give much chance to the smaller ones,\" he told the Croydon Advertiser. \"It reflects what the supermarkets have done to smaller shops in the high streets.\"",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron has hailed Britain's emergence from double-dip recession as a sign the government is \"on the right track\" and taking the right approach to boost growth. Figures published on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics confirmed the economy is out of recession, having grown by 1% in the third quarter of 2012 with spending believed to have been boosted by the Olympics over the summer. Cameron, who came under fire after official statisticians launched an inquiry into whether he had prematurely leaked the \"good news\" on Wednesday to score a political point at prime minister's questions, said the figures showed an \"underlying picture of good positive growth\" for the economy, though he acknowledged that a single quarter's data must be treated with caution. His comments were echoed by the chancellor, George Osborne, who said the ONS data was a sign that the economy \"is healing\". But the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, warned against government \"complacency and wishful thinking\" and called for more to be done to \"secure and strengthen\" growth. Speaking during a visit to a factory in south London, the prime minister conceded there was \"more to do\" but he said the figures showed \"good progress\" and that the government was \"on the right track\". He said: \"We still have a long way to go and there are still difficulties ahead, but I think these figures do show that we are on the right track, we have got the right approach.

      "body": "<h2>Ed Balls MP, Labour's shadow chancellor </h2> <p>It's good news that, with the help of the Olympics, Britain is finally out of the longest double-dip recession since the second world war. Our economy desperately needs an injection of confidence. But this is no time for complacency and wishful thinking. Today's figures show that underlying growth remains weak and that our economy is only just back to the same size as a year ago \u2014 twelve months of damaging flatlining which has seen borrowing rise in the first half of this year. And with living standards falling, more tax rises on the way, small business lending down and the eurozone still in crisis, it would be very unwise of David Cameron and George Osborne to just sit back, cross their fingers and hope for the best. The complacent thing to do now is simply to wait and hope things will get better. The cautious thing to do is to act now to secure and strengthen growth in our economy.</p> <h2>Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors </h2> <p>The bounceback in GDP growth is good news but not enough to pop the champagne corks. More than half of the quarterly increase is attributable to the Olympics and the reversal of the jubilee effect in Q2. The key message is that we're out of recession but uncertain where we're going. Not for the first time we need to heed the warning that you can't see the road ahead through the rear view mirror. Our view is that growth will continue in Q4 but we have to recognise there could be a fallback.</p> <h2>John Walker, national chairman, Federation of Small Businesses </h2> <p>We welcome the news that GDP grew by 1% in the third quarter. The economy is going in the right direction, but there is still a long way to go. Growth has flatlined in the last year, so the chancellor must use the autumn statement to sustain recovery. Small firms want to grow and if this is to happen they need confidence in the economy. The government is moving in the right direction by announcing the small business bank, but we believe that also extending the national insurance contributions holiday to all micro-firms across the UK would add \u00a31.3bn to GDP, helping to entrench growth.</p> <h2>James Knightley, analyst at ING Bank</h2> <p>We are hopeful that positive GDP growth will continue in coming quarters, although a repeat of today's 1% growth rate is highly unlikely anytime soon. The drag from negative real household disposable income is fading given the sharp drop in inflation and the fact that employment and wages are rising. The Bank of England's funding for lending scheme should also boost lending capacity while lowering borrowing costs for households and small businesses. Meanwhile, fears of another round of austerity measures are also receding. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has suggested he is comfortable with some fiscal slippage as long as it is down to external weakness rather than domestic profligacy.</p> <p>However, external risks remain. The eurozone recession and sovereign debt worries plus concerns over the US fiscal cliff are likely to act as a drag on sentiment and exports. The recent run up in sterling is also a concern as it hurts competitiveness. This suggests to us more QE is likely in November to try and give the UK a bit more of a push.</p> <h2>Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance </h2> <p>Stronger economic growth than most forecasters expected over the summer is extremely welcome news.</p> <p>One quarter of growth doesn't change the overall picture of a weak and vulnerable recovery. The first estimate for each quarter's growth should always be taken with a pinch of salt, but the new figures suggest that all those people working hard at companies struggling out of the recession are starting to get results.</p> <p>If the government wants more of this kind of good news then they need to reform our dysfunctional tax system and create the right incentives for people to work, save and invest in Britain.</p> <h2>Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit </h2> <p>The UK economy grew 1.0% in the third quarter, rebounding from a 0.4% decline in the second quarter and enjoying the strongest quarterly expansion for five years. The second quarter had seen a lost working day arising from the extra public holiday for the Queen's diamond jubilee, so a bounce back was to be expected. If we make an allowance for the drop in output caused by the extra June holiday, the underlying trend in the economy is one of modest expansion over the past two quarters, with an acceleration in the third quarter due to a large extent to the Olympics.</p> <p>Business survey data suggest that the economy's underlying quarterly growth trend over the past two quarters has been more like 0.1-0.3%.</p> <p>Despite the third quarter improvement, the UK has grown by a mere 0.3% so far this year, with output unchanged in the third quarter compared to a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>The government will most likely make the most out of this good news, but unfortunately it is unlikely that the UK will see such a strong performance again for some time. In reality, the danger is that this figure fuels a misguided belief that the economy is on the mend, when in fact there is plenty of evidence to suggest that momentum is being lost again.</p> <h2>John Cridland, CBI director general</h2> <p>It's really encouraging news that growth has snapped back so strongly in the third quarter. Although the Olympics and jubilee have made up the majority of that growth, these numbers do also seem to point to some acceleration in underlying momentum.</p> <p>We expect conditions to remain positive going into the fourth quarter, reflecting some easing of the pressure on household budgets from lower inflation. But the global economic environment remains challenging.</p> <h2>Glenn Uniacke, senior dealer at Moneycorp</h2> <p>The markets had expected strong growth. What they got was the impression that a blue touch paper had been lit.</p> <p>For the economy to have lurched skyward after such a prolonged slump appears an impressive turnaround \u2026 but scratch a little deeper and the performance looks a little less scintillating.</p> <p>Much of the boost is due to one-off factors like the Olympics, and the natural rebound effect that follows a quarter in which working days are lost.</p> <p>So strip out the exceptional factors and the figure is less breathtaking \u2014 closer to zero. And after a pitiful start to the year, the annual trend is likely to be largely flat.</p> <p>With the promised supply side reforms yet to materialise, there's every chance that Q4 will disappoint compared to Q3's surge.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, IHS Global Insight </h2> <p>The economy is far from out of the woods with further relapses highly possible in the face of still tough domestic and global (especially eurozone) conditions. So it is premature for the chancellor to contemplate singing in his bathtub (or on the train).</p> <p>Meanwhile, it is now looking an extremely close call as to whether the Bank of England opts for more quantitative easing in November. Much could well depend on survey evidence on how the economy started off the fourth quarter.</p> <p>GDP growth coming in stronger than expected in the third quarter lowers the odds that the Bank of England will hold fire on more QE in November.</p> <p>Nevertheless, with recovery currently looking limited and far from guaranteed, we believe that the Bank of England will ultimately decide to give the economy a further helping hand \u2013 be it in November or delayed until early 2013. However, we acknowledge that the Bank of England could now be done on QE with seemingly split opinions within the MPC as to whether more QE is needed and a growing view within the committee that QE may now be becoming less effective.</p> <h2>Jason Conibear, trading director at Cambridge Mercantile </h2> <p>What have we learnt today? More than anything, perhaps, that the prime minister is no good at keeping secrets. We've emerged from the double dip but nobody is denying that we've had the wind behind us. It's hard to quantify but the real figure, minus the Olympic boost and other one-off factors, is likely to be roughly half this.</p> <p>We're back in the black and it's better than many had anticipated.</p> <p>This better than expected data comes on the back of a number of positives in recent weeks, not least falling inflation, unemployment and stronger retail sales, but major question marks remain over the UK economy. The UK economy is fundamentally tied to the eurozone, our biggest export market, and that keeps the domestic economic recovery on a knife edge. With the global economy as finely balanced as it is, there's every chance we could see more contraction during 2013.</p> <h2>Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management</h2> <p>No doubt this bounce will be passed off mainly as an Olympic boost, though a much larger influence is the volatility caused by the diamond jubilee holiday in June.</p> <p>Unless we have an unusual weather event, there should be no special factors in Q4, so we will get a better idea of the underlying growth picture when the next set of GDP data is published in January.</p> <p>The MPC appears to have been stepping back from a QE extension, so it would take much weaker news on the economy for them to make a policy move next month.</p> <h2>Andrew Sissons, researcher at the Work Foundation</h2> <p>The economy remains smaller today than it did this time a year ago, and that should be a serious cause for concern. While this quarter's growth corrects for the shallow double-dip recession, it should not be taken as a sign that a strong recovery is on the way.</p> <p>The most encouraging news here is the improvement in the production industries, particularly manufacturing. British manufacturing has had a turbulent year, but its growth is vital to a healthy and balanced recovery. Government must keep working to unlock business investment, to remove barriers to growth for the firms with the most potential, and to support innovation and entrepreneurship. Meaningful action on these priorities should be central to the chancellor's autumn statement in December.</p> <h2>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First </h2> <p>Falls in construction output are a real concern, inflationary pressures will weigh on the consumer expenditure portion while eurozone issues will keep international trade and sentiment.

      "bodyText": "It's all over for another day of the Guardian's rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis on the day when the UK emerged from recession with growth of 1% in Q3. Join us tomorrow on the first anniversary of the EU agreement to tackle the European sovereign debt crisis, including a writedown of 50% of Greek bonds, a recapitalisation of European banks and an increase to the EFSF bailout fund. No doubt we'll have plenty of comments on the EU's level of success. Also: German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle meets Ireland's foreign minister Eamon Gilmore in Berlin Greek opposition leader Alexis Tsipras visits Paris for talks ECB board member Peter Praet is giving a keynote speech at an event entitled \"The Effect of Tighter Regulatory Requirements on Bank Profitability and Risk-Taking Incentives\". Should be a corker. The big economics news will be in the US with Q3 GDP figures with a consensus expecting a 1.7% rise In Germany consumer confidence figures are expected to drop slightly Thanks for all your comments and see you again tomorrow. The International Monetary Fund has been busy with Portugal today. It warns that the risks of the country's bailout plan have \"increased markedly\" as tax revenues dry up and the recession continues. The IMF said in a statement: After a strong start, the [bailout] programme has entered a more challenging phase. The risks to the macroeconomic outlook and fiscal targets are significant and tilted to the downside. However, the Troika of lenders are confident that Portugal could be a success, buoyed by recent falls in the country's 10-year bond yields, at 7.9%, instead of January highs at 17%. Unfortunately, they are worried that with new tax hikes, this could stir up public anger and lead to scenes similar to those played out on the streets of Athens. FTSE 100 closes flat at 5805 DAX up 10 points at 7202 CAC down 15 points at 3411 FTSE MIB down 178 points at 15528 IBEX down 12 points at 7779 The Fitch US downgrade rumours seem to have died down. A quick check of the ratings agency's most recent statement may be the cause... It said: Absent material adverse shocks, Fitch does not expect to resolve the [US] Negative Outlook until late 2013. Fitch will take into account any deficit-reduction strategy that may emerge after Congressional and Presidential elections in addition to an updated assessment of the medium-term economic and fiscal outlook. Agreement on a multi-year deficit reduction plan that would stabilise government indebtedness and secure confidence in the long-run sustainability of public finances would likely result in Fitch affirming U.S. 'AAA' status and revising the Rating Outlook to Stable. Conversely, failure to secure agreement on deficit-reduction that implies a continuing rise in government indebtedness over the remainder of the decade would likely result in Fitch downgrading the U.S. sovereign rating. Over to Greece, where regulators have extended a short-selling ban on the Athens stock exchange for another three months until 31st January. It means the current ban will have been in place for nearly 18 months by the time it is lifted, having first been implemented in August 2011. It had been introduced to try and stop the downward spiral on the country's stock exchange, as traders looking for a quick buck starting shorting stock and this is now the fourth extension on the ban. The Capital Market Commission said: Prevailing market conditions in the Greek and European capital markets and the continuation of the restriction on short sales by Spanish regulator CNMV were taken into consideration. Now the European Securities and Markets Association (ESMA) will have to give its thoughts on the decision. Potentially interesting development from ratings agency Fitch on Twitter. Will update as soon as we hear anything. Some more impact from the UK GDP figures this morning. The euro has taken a hit, sinking to a two-week low. The currency lost 0.6% making \u20ac1 worth 80.37p, its weakest since 11th October. A 'Truth and Reconcilliation' style tribunal should be held into the collapse of the Anglo Irish Bank - the financial institution that almost bankrupted Ireland. Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent, reports: The cost of rescuing and nationalising Anglo Irish and other banks has cost the Irish taxpayers billions of euros and saddled the state with huge debts, which they are seeking help from the EU to cover. The call for such an inquiry was made today in Dublin at a Transparency International conference focussing on corruption in the Republic. Dr Jane Suiter, a panelist at the conference, politics lecturer and anti-corruption campaigner, said such a commission would be far cheaper than previous tribunals into Irish political corruption that cost tens of millions of euros. She warned that the Irish political class may oppose establishing a tribunal into banking given the alleged connections between top bankers, major property speculators and politicians. \"I don't think there is any great appetite for it given that a lot of peope involved were in the major parties,\" she said. Angela Merkel would not have the backing of her coalition partners to push through a deal to give Greece a loan of \u20ac16bn-\u20ac20bn, said Otto Fricke a budget spokesman for her junior coalition partner. ekathimerini reports: Fricke was speaking after Handelsblatt newspaper cited an agreement between the Greek government and its international creditors as saying that Greece will get a loan of 16-20 billion euros to supplement its second rescue package while gaining an extra two years to reach its deficit targets. Germany\u2019s parliament would need to approve the loan. Fricke, a Free Democratic Party lawmaker, told reporters in Berlin on Thursday that he sees \u201cno majority for such a thing.\u201d EC president Herman Van Rompuy has, apparently been and gone from Number 10 Downing Street, with no press conference to announce what was discussed. The press office is still debating whether to put a statement out on what was said. We'll post anything as soon as we get it. In the meantime, here's another picture of the pair when they met earlier today. Meanwhile, Open Europe is running the headline that Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt has threatened to veto the next long-term EU budget if Denmark fails to secure a rebate of 1bn Danish Krone. The Coalition's record on Europe has been \"lamentable\" especially the \"phantom veto\" which has harmed relations with EU partners, said Labour MP Chris Leslie at an Open Europe event this afternoon. He said: That's not to say UK should never wield veto but it has to be done in a way to safeguard national interests not like in December. He said Europe still suffers from accountability and democratic deficit. He is hesitant about an in/out referendum because it crowds out debate on reform of structures, institutions and policy areas. The UK should be leading on reforming the \"oil tanker\" EU budget, he added, and we should be looking at real term cuts not just a freeze on spending. US durable goods orders rose by almost 10% in September, driven by a sharp increase in orders for transportation equipment. That compares with forecasts of a 7% rise, and a 13% slump in August. Durable goods are goods expected to last more than three years, so usually require large investments. A rise suggests buyers are more optimistic about the economy. Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Group, said: We've seen weak durable goods orders for a while here, so to see this strong number is heartening. We've also heard from a number of companies in the reporting season that September was a weak month for business. This indicates that at least orders of the durables side are strengthening here. Jobless claims in the US, meanwhile, fell last week, raising hopes that the labour market is healing. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped 23,000 to 369,000. Briefly back to GDP, the disparity between Britain's regions increased more than in any other major economy over the past 12 years, according to the Bank of International Settlements, via Sky News' Ed Conway. David Cameron said he will discuss keeping Europe's costs under control with EC preisdent Herman Van Rompuy today, Retuers reports. Speaking ahead of the talks, but after Van Rompuy arrived, Cameron told reporters: We have the whole question of the future budget which I'm sure we'll be discussing today and how important I think it's to keep our costs and spending under control. Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras is apparently back in business, after discharging himself from hospital (see 11.24am), with reports that he has said the troika will not accept changes to agreed labour measures. A spokesman for the Democratic Left (DIMAR) has already said it will not vote for the labour reforms as they stand. Ireland has received a relatively clean bill of health from the troika of the ECB, the European Comission and the IMF. In a statement following the review mission to Ireland, the troika noted: Policy implementation remains steadfast despite the challenging external environment, helping Ireland to start to regain market access. The country is expected to meet its fiscal targets this year and the troika say the authorities are committed to next year's deficit ceiling of 7.5%. The economy is expected to grow by 0.5% this year, and 1% next. But, the troika notes: Unemployment remains unacceptably high, especially among the youth, making job creation and growth a key priority. There is a huge amount of regional disparity in this 'recovery', as the reader showmaster notes in the comments below. Sky is running a good graphic on this (in the highlights on the right). The unemployment slide is probably the most telling, with a rate of 9.9% in the North East, compared with 5.8% in south west England. Union Unite also notes that growth is too focused on London and does not reflect the \u2018real\u2019 economy. General secretary, Len McCluskey, said: Too much of the growth is centred on London and the service sector, a more realistic indicator is that the construction industry is still in the doldrums and its contribution to the last quarter\u2019s GDP figures declined by 2.5 per cent. With some 90% of the cuts still to come, consumer confidence is what we really need to recover, but with crippling income and housing cuts heading for the low waged there will be little chance of hope spreading beyond the M25. The European Parliament has rejected the nomination of Yves Mersch, president of the central bank of Luxembourg, to the executive board of the European Central Bank. On Monday, the economic affairs committee rejected his nomination, saying that it would result in an all-male board at the ECB. However, some believe Mersch was rejected because many of the committee's members do not agree with him politically. Mersch is known as an inflation hawk The vote is not, however, binding and many expect the appointment to go ahead anyway. The responses to news that the UK is out of recession keep coming in. Juergen Maier, managing director of Siemens Industry heralded the 1% rise as \"great news for the UK economy\". This is a really strong number that I think also confirms a catch up from last quarter\u2019s bank holidays and special effects. The best thing about this data is that it now gives industry real confidence that a genuine recovery is firmly within reach. Whilst it will remain tough for at least 12 months, it is the fastest growth seen since the crash of 2008 with manufacturing up significantly which we must see as confidence to invest for the future. Where we need to work harder is to ensure a stronger local supply base for these industries, and that journey is going to take a little longer because it takes real long term investment in skills, automated factories and R&amp;D. Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras has beentaken to hospital on Thursday, where he was diagnosed with a serious viral infection and exhaustion. ekathimerini reports: The minister was discharged at his own request before returning to the Finance Ministry offices for talks with officials ahead of a scheduled meeting with Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. ekathimerini then lists a staggering number of Greek ministers who have been feeling the strain from the punishing schedule of negotiations with the troika. Earlier this month, Justice Minister Antonis Roupakiotis underwent an operation to remove a blood clot from his brain. In June, former National Bank president Vassilis Rapanos turned down the job of Finance Minister, offered to him by Samaras, citing serious health problems. A few days before that [Prime Minister Antonis] Samaras himself underwent eye surgery. At last October's crucial European Union summit, two aides to the then Prime Minister George Papandreou suffered serious health problems. Giorgos Glynos suffered a heart attack ahead of the meeting, while Giorgos Zannias developed high blood pressure during the summit and was ordered to stay in his room. Back to the eurozone, where lending to companies has dropped significantly in September as the bleak economic outlook dampened demand. The European Central Bank said loans in the private sector fell 0.8% from the same month a year ago, below expectations of a 0.6% fall. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said the drop was not just down to uncertainty over the economic outlook but also a result of banks' unwillingness to lend. The concern is that a number of companies who do want to borrow \u2013 whether it be to support their operations, lift investment, explore new markets \u2013 and are in decent shape are finding it hard to. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has come through with a veritable essay of a response to the GDP figures. No wonder it took him so long. Some edited highlights... He notes that the UK economy has grown by just 0.6% over the past two year, compared with growth of 3.4% in the US and 3.3% in Germany. So the question for the coming months is whether and how we can catch up all the ground we have lost over the last two years and not keep falling behind as other countries move ahead. Balls proposes a plan to secure and sustain a strong economic recovery, including using funds from the 4G mobile spectrum auction to build 100,000 affordable homes, a temporary VAT cut and a bank bonus tax to fund jobs for young people out of work. We also need action to ease the squeeze for people on low and middle incomes, rather than a tax cut for millionaires. And we need long-term changes to make our economy stronger, including a long-term plan to rebuild our infrastructure and radical reform of the banks. David Tinsley at BNP Paribas has a mixed response to the GDP data. He too says the entire 1% bounce could be down to one-off factors. Still that might prove to be a little bit of tough assessment \u2013 it may well be the there was some weak positive momentum over the middle of this year. Certainly the labour market data would suggest that is the case. Overall, appearances can be deceiving. The UK economy is not growing at an annualised rate of 4.0%! But nonetheless the economy is at least flat and maybe moving forward. That\u2019s a better position then many economies elsewhere in Europe. My mistake (re lack of Labour response, see 10.19am), Ed Balls' spinner Alex Belardinelli did tweet on GDP about an hour ago. The CBI sounds a more upbeat note on the figures. Director general John Cridland said: It\u2019s really encouraging news that growth has snapped back so strongly in the third quarter. Although the Olympics and Jubilee have made up the majority of that growth, these numbers do also seem to point to some acceleration in underlying momentum. We expect conditions to remain positive going into the fourth quarter, reflecting some easing of the pressure on household budgets from lower inflation. But the global economic environment remains challenging. Vicky Redwood of Captial Economics says it is possible that all of the 1% rise in GDP was down to temporary factors. As the Olympic effects unwind, it is still possible that the economy contract again in Q4. This would leave GDP in 2012 as a whole shrinking, albeit by slightly less than the 0.5% drop that we have been forecasting. But, she says, the Chancellor has already jumped on the figures as a vindication for sticking to Plan A. Given that the public borrowing figures are also looking less dreadful than they were, a significant change of course in December\u2019s Autumn Statement might now be a bit less likely. There is (as noted by London &amp; Capital Asset Management's global head of dealing) a deafening silence from Labour, usually so ready to comment on economic figures. Off GDP news for a minute and over to Italy, where retail sales were (very slightly) better than expected. Retail sales were unchanged in August, compared with expectations of a 0.2% decline. They continue to point to long-running weakness of consumer spending in Italy, where household budgets have been squeezed by rising taxes and stagnant wages. The economy is expected to shrink by around 2.5% this year. More analyst comment on the UK GDP figures (see 9.30am - up 1% in Q3). Howard Archer of Global Insight, also sees the possibility of the economy slipping again before the end of the year. The economy is far from out of the woods with further relapses highly possible in the face of still tough domestic and global (especially Eurozone) conditions. So it is premature for the Chancellor to contemplate singing in his bathtub (or on the train). He says it is an extremely close call over whether the Bank of England opts for increase its quantitative easing programme in November. Nevertheless, with recovery currently looking limited and far from guaranteed, we believe that the Bank of England will ultimately decide to give the economy a further helping hand \u2013 be it in November or delayed until early-2013. And comments from the man himself. Chancellor George Osborne said (in an emailed statement, thank you MickGJ): There is still a long way to go, but these figures show we are on the right track. This another sign [typo, Chancellor's own] that the economy is healing and we have the right approach: we've cut the deficit by a quarter, over a million new jobs have been created in the private sector, inflation is down, and the economy is growing. Yesterday\u2019s weak data from the eurozone were a reminder that we still face many economic challenges at home and abroad. By continuing to take the tough decisions needed to deal with our debts and equip our economy for the global race we\u2019re in, this Government is laying the foundations for lasting prosperity. Chris Williamson at Markit sounds a typically gloomy note. He says there is a danger that GDP will fall again in the fourth quarter. The government will most likely make the most out of this good news, but unfortunately it is unlikely that the UK will see such a strong performance again for some time. In reality, the danger is that this figure fuels a misguided belief that the economy is on the mend, when in fact there is plenty of evidence to suggest that momentum is being lost again. There is a real risk that a return to contraction might be seen again in the fourth quarter. The official release is now up. Apart from the headline figure, it is worth restating that GDP is flat compared with the third quarter last year. The ONS said Olympic ticket sales added 0.2%. They said the events would also have driven the creative arts and entertainment activities, hotels, food and drink and transport. It said there was little evidence of an Olympic effect in retail, while video, TV and programme production was weak because of \"people watching the Olympics instead\". Independent economist Shaun Richards points to construction as a continuing worry. And it seems the presentation is over. Simon Neville writes: That's it. As soon as it had started it has finished. The three cameramen start packing up their kit. The broadcast reporters dash off to start giving their analysis and the statisticians start to consider what they'll say as they give a round of one-on-one interviews with Sky, BBC, Channel 4 and others. The manufacturers' organisation the EEF is quick off the mark with its response. Chief executive Terry Scuoler said: Output across manufacturing and the wider economy has mounted a strong rebound confirming that activity wasn\u2019t lost, just displaced from the previous quarter. This has to be regarded as a positive development, given the disappointing data in the year so far. However, a true account of the UK\u2019s economic performance has been skewed recently due to a series of one-off events, and this quarter is no different. The question is whether this first estimate is enough to signal an improvement in the underlying growth picture. With survey data, particularly in our major markets, pointing to difficult trading conditions in recent months, it\u2019s unlikely this pace of expansion will be maintained into the new year. The Office for National Statistics says we should look at the run of GDP figures, not just one quarter. It said output has been flat over the past year. A word of warning for the Chancellor, perhaps? Here come the more muted responses. Data provider Markit notes that we are still significantly below the peak in 2008. Economists calculate that underlying growth over the past two quarters is 0.3%. More from Simon Neville: And that's it. No whoops or cheers. The bunting has not been hung out and champagne corks remain in. (Although there is a distant hubbub from the larger hall in the next room where the civil service fast track members are meeting. Keen is an understatement. In terms of the detail, the UK service sector picked up 1.3%, industrial output was up by 1.1%, but construction dropped by 2.5%. Overall, it was the biggest rise since the third quarter of 2007. Simon Neville writes: We may have come out of recession but ONS budgets still being squeezed. A handful of biscuits and tea and coffee is all that await journalists The economy grew by 1% in the third quarter, pulling the UK out of the longest double dip recession since the second world war. That is a genuinely good result. Economists said the Olympics and the bounce-back after the Jubilee weekend in the second quarter would add around 0.7% to output. This level means there is some genuine underlying growth. The result will strengthen the chancellor's hand ahead of his autumn statement in December. My colleague Simon Neville is at the GDP presentation. He writes: Only six journalists in the chairs with 5 minutes to go until start of GDP announcement in Church House conference centre. One ONS staff member tells me 10 years ago there would be journalists from all newspapers. Another tells me to sit near the front to make it look busy... Adding to the corporate gloom, Santander said net profits dropped by two thirds in the nine months to September. The eurozone's biggest bank said it had been hit by writedowns on bad property investments made during Spain's decade-long housing boom. Santander has written off \u20ac5bn in losses and says it has now completed 90% of the writedowns, forced on the bank by the government, of repossessed housing and unrecoverable loans to developers. It has also increased provisions against bad debts to \u20ac9.5bn. A quick look at the markets, which are looking relatively buoyant, considering the dire corporate news. (see 8.05am) UK FTSE 100: up 0.5%, or 29 points, to 5834 France CAC 40: up 0.8% Germany DAX: up 0.4% Spain IBEX: up 0.5% Italy FTSE MIB: up 0.6% Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research has a witty take on GDP this morning. The [Q3 GDP] figure should be \u201cgood news\u201d or it would indicate that our PM can\u2019t read\u2026I guess the Chancellor can\u2019t read train tickets so who knows what the figure will be\u2026 He also has an interesting take on ECB President Mario Draghi's speech to the German parliament yesterday. Mr Draghi came, he saw and he got out alive. Whilst you could make counter arguments for nearly everything he said, if he had not acted when he did then Spanish bonds would now be talked about in price rather than yield terms and we might be facing a complete implosion of the Eurozone. So you pay your money and you takes your choice. I can\u2019t resist mentioning the following comment though; \u201cOMT\u2019s will not lead to disguised financing of governments\u2026\u201d Well no, quite. There is nothing disguised about it. Sweden has kept its key interest rate at 1.25% as expected but said it would be raised at a later stage and at a slower pace than forecast in September. What's more, some of the members of its rate-setting committee advocated cutting the rate this month, with one pushing for a cut to 0.75%. Celebrations for David Cameron, at least, will be curtailed. He is due to meet Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council at midday to wrangle over the EU budget. It is likely to be a heated conversation. The European Parliament this week backed a 6.8% rise in EU spending for 2013 and an overall rise of at least 5% for 2014-2020, both due to be agreed before the end of the year. The long-term budget requires unanimity among the 27 member-states and Cameron has threatened to veto any increase above inflation. The budget for next year, however, is decided by qualified majority voting, meaning Britain could be overruled. Betting for the GDP figures are in. Our office sweepstake runs from +0.3% to +1%. Whatever happens the government will laud it as a success, but it's worth noting what Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics said late last week. She thinks the rise in GDP will largely be a result of temporary effects, such as the Olympics and a bounce back after the jubilee weekend in the second quarter dented output. Those factors will add at least 0.7% to third-quarter GDP, she said. GDP will therefore need to have risen by more than that to point to any recovery in underlying output. Anything less should be viewed as disappointing. For the record, she is betting on +0.6%. There's a torrent of bad news from companies in the UK and the eurozone out this morning. German luxury car company Daimler was perhaps the worst, warning that it would miss its earnings forecast by around \u20ac1bn. The company announced plans to cut \u20ac2bn of costs by the end of 2014. It blamed: Significantly more difficult market conditions. Net profits at Credit Suisse tumbled by 63% in the third quarter, prompting the bank to announce an extra 1bn Swiss francs of cost cuts by 2015. France Telecom slashed its dividend for this year and next, after it said operating cash flow next year would fall by around \u20ac1bn. It has been hit by the arrival of Iliad's low-cost mobile service and a nine-month price war. And in the UK, WPP \u2013 the world's largest advertising group \u2013 cut its full-year outlook for the second time in two months. Chief executive Martin Sorrell told Reuters: We're exceedingly cautious now. There's a lot of concern out there. He said business owners' main concern had switched from the fate of the eurozone crisis to how the US government would tackle its deficit. UK preliminary GDP for Q3: 9.30am Italy retail sales for August: 10am David Cameron meets EC President: 12pm US durable goods for September: 1.30pm US weekly jobless claims: 1.30pm In the debt markets, the US is selling three and six-month treasury bills, and seven-year notes. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone debt crisis. Today is all about Britain's GDP figures, due out at 9.30am. David Cameron \u2013 who sees the data one day in advance \u2013 hinted yesterday it will be an upbeat release, with his comment: The good news is going to keep coming. Later in the day, data on durable goods orders in the US are expected to show growing consumer confidence across the pond. But it's not all good news. There's a slew of gloomy corporate data from the UK and Europe out already this morning, more on that shortly.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Germany's Daimler warned on Wednesday that it would miss its earnings forecast this year by about \u20ac1bn (\u00a3808m) and would not improve profit margins next year as expected, blaming \"significantly more difficult market conditions\". To combat the accelerated slump in the western European car market, Daimler revealed plans to cut \u20ac2bn in costs by the end of 2014 to support sagging returns at its core Mercedes-Benz Cars division, the bulk of which would be front loaded. The luxury carmaker, in financial results inadvertently released a day ahead of schedule, said it now expected only \u20ac8bn in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from its ongoing business in 2012, rather than the original outlook for flat profits of about \u20ac9bn. \"Due to the economic challenges, Daimler will not match the high prior-year EBIT in full-year 2012, but will still post good earnings once again,\" the chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, said in the statement sent out by email. Most analysts no longer expected the car and truck maker to maintain its forecast for 2012, which was supposed to be a \"transitional year\" that would pave the way next year for the group to hit divisional targets that had been in place since February 2011. \"We regard Daimler's Q3 numbers combined with the muted outlook for the rest of this year and 2013 as a major setback for the Daimler bulls. We continue to believe investors are finding better risk/return in VW and BMW,\" the Credit Suisse analyst Arndt Ellinghorst wrote following the results. Earlier on Wednesday, Volkswagen reaffirmed operating profit would be flat this year, while BMW's chief financial officer told Reuters in an interview that the group would retain its 2012 outlook. The Bernstein analyst Max Warburton called its decline versus BMW and Volkswagen \"saddening\", seeing little hope for investors over the next 12 months in part because he expects Daimler will have to cut its dividend either for this year or the next. Daimler's CEO had already scaled back his ambitions somewhat, saying last month that the Mercedes division would fall short of its profit target despite record vehicle sales. He had also cast doubt on the 2013 goal of raising the EBIT margin for Mercedes to 10%, which Zetsche has aimed for since May 2010. In the statement on Wednesday, Daimler said Mercedes would only earn \u20ac4.4bn this year compared with the \u20ac5.2bn originally sought. All other industrial divisions \u2013 trucks, vans, and buses \u2013 were each forecast to earn roughly \u20ac200m less than previously expected. Daimler added that it could no longer achieve its divisional EBIT margin targets next year, which included reaching 10% at Mercedes and 8% at Trucks. Last year they were 9% and 6.5%, respectively. \"The achievement of those targets has become much more challenging due to the significantly more difficult market conditions prevailing at present,\" the Daimler statement said. \"The group assumes that the targets will be not met until a later date, but continues to pursue them vigorously, with the support of measures taken and programmes initiated in all divisions,\" it added. A significant portion of the planned \u20ac2bn in cost cuts at Mercedes will be achieved by the end of 2013, in part by reducing fixed costs, spending for research and development and fixed capital investment. The company also said its third-quarter operating profit dropped 2% to \u20ac1.92bn, better than the average forecast of \u20ac1.87bn given by analysts in a Reuters poll of 12 banks and brokerages. Daimler burned through \u20ac200m in cash during the third quarter mainly due to inventory stockbuilding of the new Mercedes A-Class ahead of its September launch. Net liquidity in its industrial business shrank to \u20ac8.21bn at the end of September \u2013 its lowest level since the end of the first quarter in 2010. Concerned by the high level of cash burn so far this year even before making a substantial future payment needed to increase its stake in its Chinese import sales company, Bernstein's Warburton recommended investors steer clear of Daimler for now. \"Arguments have been put forward for Daimler \u2013 arguments based on model cycle and an element of 'surely it can get better'. One day Daimler will likely get better,\" he wrote. \"But right now it is hard to see why.\"",

      "bodyText": "The hint from the prime minister could hardly have been clearer. Taunted by Ed Miliband about what a bad week it had been for the government, David Cameron pointed to evidence in the past week that inflation and unemployment were both down, adding that \"the good news will keep on coming\". That \"good news\" will come in the form of the announcement on Thursday that Britain has emerged from a double-dip recession spanning nine months from the autumn of 2011 to the middle of 2012. For George Osborne, in particular, the release of the growth figures will be a blessed relief. Last week, for fans of the Beatles, he was the chancellor without a ticket to ride.
