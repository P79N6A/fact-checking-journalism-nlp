      "bodyText": "I wonder if some bank executives in Australia should rewatch of Robert Connolly\u2019s 2001 film The Bank, in which the protagonist, Jim Doyle, when asked why he perpetrated a scam on a bank, replies: \u201cI just hate banks.\u201d Since the bank levy was announced on budget day, the Australian Bankers Association, led by it chief executive, Anna Bligh, and the big-four banks have sought to suggest it is ruinous for Australia\u2019s economy and an attack on the banks for merely being profitable. Among the threats has been the suggestion of a \u201cmining tax\u201d-style advertising campaign. One would wonder why any bank CEO talking about the importance of profitability would suggest such a thing, given it would undoubtedly be a complete waste of shareholders\u2019 money. Unlike mining, which has a vague sense of being vital to our economy but which is largely detached from most Australians, we all have dealings with banks. Where the mining companies ran advertisements about the \u201ctrue-blue\u201d Aussies working in the sector, it is rather a lot tougher for the banks to do that in light of the constant closure of branches and the removal of staff in place of ATMs. And the banks have not helped themselves at all. This week Macquarie Bank let it be known through the AFR (a paper that very much sees the large banks as its core constituency) that it was considering upping sticks and moving overseas. That\u2019s a pretty dumb political response from a bank that owes much to Australian taxpayers from the bank deposit guarantee the Rudd government instituted during the darkest days of the global financial crisis. During that time the government did everything in its power to ensure the Australian banking system suffered none of the collapses seen around the world. You could argue it did too much \u2013 allowing mergers to occur, such as Westpac taking over St George and Commonwealth Bank taking over Bankwest. Paul Keating soon afterwards suggested as much, arguing: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have agreed as treasurer to allow St George to go into Westpac, because you go from six banks, seven banks, to four and, in the end, what they\u2019ll do, working on the basis of never give the suckers an even break, they\u2019ll simply put the margins up.\u201d And yet now that the government is planning a levy of 0.06% on their licensed entity liabilities, well gosh \u2013 Armageddon, and time to leave these socialist shores. The Commonwealth Bank, in its submission to the Treasury on the bank levy, suggested it \u201cworks against a number of the government\u2019s core economic goals including supporting business to invest and create jobs, and attracting capital to Australia\u201d. It also argued: \u201cIt contradicts the idea that we want people and businesses in Australia to be productive and successful. The levy implies that being profitable is a negative when, in fact, the banking industry\u2019s profitability benefits and supports the whole economy.\u201d Rather nicely the line about attacking companies for \u201cbeing profitable\u201d echoes the line this week from the prime minister suggesting Labor\u2019s insistence on keeping the 2% deficit levy for those earning over $180,000 undermines \u201caspiration and fairness, while worsening incentives and economic efficiency\u201d. The line is silly when uttered by the prime minister and equally so when put forward by the banks. This week in Senate estimates the head of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, Wayne Byres, when asked about the impact of the levy on the stability of the financial system, replied: \u201cThose banks are obviously not happy about having to pay the levy. That is true. But even after that levy is paid, they will still be quite profitable institutions.\u201d Byres went on to state that Apra had come to the view that the levy \u201cwas something that the industry could take on. They were never going to be happy about it, obviously, but they could take it on without threatening the resilience of the system or of an individual institution.\u201d Earlier in the week the head of the Treasury department, John Fraser, also during a Senate estimates hearing, suggested of the economic impacts \u2013 specifically relating to interest rates \u2013 that \u201ccommon sense would suggest they are trivial\u201d. This conforms quite well with research by the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, whose briefing note on the bank levy counters the claim by the banks that lower returns to shareholders will hurt Australians superannuation balances, by arguing even if banks passed the full cost on to shareholders through reduced dividends, \u201cat most it would impact the average superannuation balance by $7 a year\u201d. And as for interest rates, the Australia Institute agrees with the advice of the treasurer, Scott Morrison, that homeowners should shop around. The Australia Institute notes that the smaller banks offer home loans on average around one percentage point lower than the big four. The banks will of course grumble but this levy is not a tax on success or a hit to the stability of either the economy or the financial system. Their problems are much more the work of the banks themselves \u2013 including lending practices that have seen housing interest-only loans account for up to 50% of mortgage borrowing. Such loans help fuel the housing-price boom and do much to create a price bubble. Worries of a bubble led S&amp;P Global to downgrade the credit rating of 23 smaller banks after the budget. It cited concerns that \u201cthe risk of a sharp correction in property prices has increased\u201d. In arguing for the levy, the government has made it clear that the big four and Macquarie are treated as special by the government \u2013 and that treatment is worth (in the treasurer\u2019s view) \u201cabout a 20 to 40 basis point advantage because of the nature of the regulation and structure of our financial system\u201d. The bank levy is thus in effect making it explicit that the big four banks and Macquarie are too big to fail. And crucially, S&amp;P did not downgrade the credit rating of any of those five banks, arguing that it expected they would receive \u201ctimely financial support from the Australian government, if needed\u201d. Effectively, the special treatment the big four banks and Macquarie receive by paying the bank levy also sees them spared a credit rating downgrade and helps not only to keep their borrowing costs down but also (and somewhat perversely) improves their competitive advantage over the smaller banks. Though I doubt you\u2019ll see any banks thank the government for that.",

      "bodyText": "Paul Sutherland is not a man you\u2019d want to mess about. The martial arts instructor, 44, had woken early on the last Saturday in May and checked in on his phone for his British Airways flight to Stockholm, where he was due to officiate at a night of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) bouts. By 7.30am, he had packed his suitcase, complete with laptop and paperwork, into the boot of his car and left his home in Gloucester, picking up two colleagues en route for the 98-mile drive to Heathrow. But just as Sutherland was coming off the M4 at 9.30am, something was going haywire in BA\u2019s nerve centre: a power outage that would mean Sutherland, and 75,000 other passengers, would get no further than the departure lounge. The mayhem started in Boadicea House: simply known as \u201cthe computer building\u201d when it was built for BOAC in 1967 and now managed by CBRE, a global firm that prides itself on \u201cunderstanding how data centre mechanical and electrical services, IT platform requirements and property interact\u201d. Its power was guaranteed by an uninterruptible supply \u2013 only this one was, somehow, interrupted. For a brief but critical moment, the electricity to the servers was cut: and when it was restored, the inter-related systems guiding BA\u2019s global network were thrown into meltdown. At Heathrow Terminal 5, staff were geared up for one of the busiest days of the year: the start of bank holiday weekend and summer half-term, with many families among the ranks of travellers. Suddenly, the self-check-in terminals went blank; phone apps were down; BA\u2019s own email was lost. Internal networks that allocate planes to gates and tell crew where to report failed. Around the world, passengers trying to check in for London flights were finding the computer saying no. In the sky above London, BA pilots were left circling. Denis Fischbacher-Smith, 60, a Glasgow University academic, was on a flight from Copenhagen that would soon be on its final approach to Heathrow. Instead, the captain announced over the intercom that its landing was delayed by congestion due to a storm; and later that lightning had knocked out communications with ground staff. On landing, the captain told passengers he could not find out which gate the plane should taxi to, and finally admitted he had no clue when buses would arrive for the passengers. Inside the terminal, queues for those still expecting to depart were building rapidly. Many who had checked in remotely before the system died still wanted to drop bags. At 11.30am, after a two-hour wait, Sutherland was given a tag for his suitcase, but told the luggage belt wasn\u2019t working and he should take it to a porter in zone C. \u201cThere were thousands of bags there. It was unreal.\u201d That was the last time Sutherland saw his bag. He then joined thousands more unwary BA customers in going through security to departure-lounge hell. BA\u2019s Spanish chief executive, Alex Cruz, had by now arrived at the recently refurbished crisis command centre at BA\u2019s Waterside House HQ. Like most major airlines, BA has well-practised procedures for crisis management, with drills held up to four times a year. Over eight-hour shifts, teams of senior managers would take their places at two horseshoe-shaped tables, holding conference calls with Heathrow\u2019s own crisis centre while facing a video wall showing BA\u2019s fleet and worldwide movements, news broadcasts, surges in Twitter activity \u2013 and planes going nowhere. But at the terminal, the lack of communications was heightening the crisis, leaving helpless staff faced with irate passengers and no information. Departure boards showed flights whose times had come and gone. BA\u2019s first tool for communicating with its increasingly bewildered customers, in and out of the airport, was Twitter, via its Newcastle-based social media team. But they couldn\u2019t keep up with customers tweeting their own devastating verdicts \u2013 holidays in tatters, elderly relatives stranded, even a Greek wedding now missing its bridesmaids and guests. Passengers at the airport were increasingly relying on word of mouth and online news, rather than airline staff. By 2.30pm, the media was reporting that no BA planes would fly from Heathrow or Gatwick before 6pm, a story rejected as \u201cfalse news\u201d in a rare announcement in the departure lounge. But within 20 minutes, a second announcement confirmed that all BA flights were indeed cancelled, at least until 6pm. Contingency plans were laid but, in the chaos, even escaping proved impossible, says Sutherland: \u201cThe UFC tried to book me on another flight at 5.30pm, but I couldn\u2019t even get to Terminal 2, because of the queues to get out.\u201d Huge lines formed at doors that were never opened; queues for claim forms stretched around the terminal, with many in the dark about their rights as the airline pledged to rebook them. Fischbacher-Smith, whose academic field is corporate risk and resilience, was getting a first-hand case study. \u201cI think people would have been more understanding had there been communication on the ground. Failure is one thing. The response is something else.\u201d At 6.30pm, Cruz\u2019s first Twitter broadcast identified a \u201cpower supply issue\u201d, thanked customers for their patience \u2013 and confirmed that all the rest of the day\u2019s flights were cancelled. The explanation only puzzled many further. Fischbacher-Smith says: \u201cIf there\u2019s such a significant vulnerability in the system, you\u2019d normally expect it to be tested and designed out of it. It\u2019s not uncommon for latent errors to be embedded in system design \u2013 but you\u2019d expect early warnings and near misses to be acted upon.\u201d And there had been warnings. Last July, a \u201cshort-lived problem with our check-in system\u201d, in BA\u2019s words, left passengers at its London airports delayed by up to four hours. In September, a second check-in failure in 12 weeks saw passengers given handwritten boarding passes amid lengthy queues \u2013 another reported \u201ccomputer glitch\u201d. Damian Brewer, analyst at RBC, wrote of this month\u2019s meltdown: \u201cIt is tempting but increasingly questionable to view this as a one-off. Across IAG, material operational failures seem to have become a recurring topic. This summer it is BA\u2019s IT meltdown, last year Vueling.\u201d Cruz was chief executive at Vueling, BA\u2019s sister airline in IAG, but moved to BA just before the Spanish low-cost airline cancelled scores of flights in a May 2016 weekend, leaving thousands grounded at its Barcelona base and prompting a government inquiry. Incidents at other carriers such as Delta had vividly demonstrated the risks of an IT outage, so the explanation of a power issue seemed, Brewer added, to suggest \u201cfundamental management and planning weakness in BA\u201d. The problems came amid a growing narrative of costcutting at BA and parent company IAG that had left some observers wondering about the diminishing brand. Although the airline has dismissed any connection between the weekend\u2019s chaos and the outsourcing of jobs to India, the GMB union said it was \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d to see no link with BA\u2019s having made hundreds of experienced IT staff redundant. A series of strikes by cabin crew in BA\u2019s \u201cmixed fleet\u201d branch \u2013 set up during the bitter industrial dispute of 2011 and consisting entirely of new entrants \u2013 testified to simmering discontent among some staff. Another walkout has now been called for late June. Longstanding customers will have noted recent developments such as the axing of free food on short-haul flights, higher fares for flying with hold baggage, and the reconfiguration of some planes to shrink passengers\u2019 space. While Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, briskly rebuffs any notion of staff or customer discontent, pointing to growing passenger and job applicant numbers, even City analysts who applauded his efficiencies have started to wonder if the costcutting has gone too far. Among European airlines, BA has some of the lowest satisfaction scores for customers and staff, according to surveys by Glassdoor and Skytrax. Walsh\u2019s tough efficiencies have led to booming profits for IAG, with Iberia, the first partner in the 2011 merger, forced to slash its fleet and wage bill. The shares, 146p five years ago, are near an all-time high, closing at 607p on Friday, despite the previous weekend\u2019s debacle. Vueling and now Aer Lingus, where Walsh earned his reputation, make up the rest of the IAG fold in an industry where rivals such as Ryanair dominate the short-haul market. This week, IAG launched a long-haul, low-cost carrier, Level, out of Barcelona, following Norwegian\u2019s threat to its transatlantic market. The lines have become increasingly blurred, but while BA has cut costs to compete on fares, so far it still retains a significant brand loyalty. Whether that can survive many more events such as last weekend\u2019s fiasco is critical. Its Avios points scheme keeps many frequent flyers in BA\u2019s network, to the point where even some stranded travellers last week spoke only of \u201cquestioning their loyalty\u201d rather than vowing to switch. But aviation consultant Chris Tarry says: \u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive environment. When you lose those customers it costs a lot to win them back.\u201d Should the tens of thousands stranded that Saturday \u2013 and potentially the same number again delayed as the knock-on effects stretched into Monday \u2013 decide to switch, BA\u2019s loss could far outstrip the estimated \u00a3100m compensation bill. The worst of the debacle came to an end on the Saturday night, when the last of the passengers stuck airside filtered back through immigration, after the indignity of a two-hour queue at the border \u2013 having never left the airport. Heathrow staff, who had suffered Walsh\u2019s public ire during the last comparable public relations catastrophe, when the baggage system failed at the opening of Terminal 5, quietly handed out mats and blankets to passengers who opted to sleep in its halls. The rest of Heathrow was fully functioning, but, as an airport insider put it: \u201cFor BA, it was like someone had literally had flicked the switch.\u201d It may yet prove that they had done just that. Sutherland, meanwhile, emerged just before 10pm, returning to Gloucester without his case or laptop, never to make it to the Swedish fight night, with thousands lost in earnings. Five days later, although he was still waiting for a response to his many calls and messages to BA, he had a text saying his suitcase had arrived \u2013 in Stockholm.",

      "body": "<p>Paul Sutherland is not a man you\u2019d want to mess about. The martial arts instructor, 44, had woken early on the last Saturday in May and checked in on his phone for his British Airways flight to Stockholm, where he was due to officiate at a night of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) bouts. By 7.30am, he had packed his suitcase, complete with laptop and paperwork, into the boot of his car and left his home in Gloucester, picking up two colleagues en route for the 98-mile drive to Heathrow.</p> <p>But just as Sutherland was coming off the M4 at 9.30am, something was going haywire in BA\u2019s nerve centre: a power outage that would mean Sutherland, and 75,000 other passengers, would get no further than the departure lounge.</p> <p>The mayhem started in Boadicea House: simply known as \u201cthe computer building\u201d when it was built for BOAC in 1967 and now managed by CBRE, a global firm that prides itself on \u201cunderstanding how data centre mechanical and electrical services, IT platform requirements and property interact\u201d. Its power was guaranteed by an uninterruptible supply \u2013 only this one was, somehow, interrupted. For a brief but critical moment, the electricity to the servers was cut: and when it was restored, the inter-related systems guiding BA\u2019s global network were thrown into meltdown.</p> <p>At Heathrow Terminal 5, staff were geared up for one of the busiest days of the year: the start of bank holiday weekend and summer half-term, with many families among the ranks of travellers. Suddenly, the self-check-in terminals went blank; phone apps were down; BA\u2019s own email was lost. Internal networks that allocate planes to gates and tell crew where to report failed. Around the world, passengers trying to check in for London flights were finding the computer saying no.</p> <p>In the sky above London, BA pilots were left circling. Denis Fischbacher-Smith, 60, a Glasgow University academic, was on a flight from Copenhagen that would soon be on its final approach to Heathrow. Instead, the captain announced over the intercom that its landing was delayed by congestion due to a storm; and later that lightning had knocked out communications with ground staff. On landing, the captain told passengers he could not find out which gate the plane should taxi to, and finally admitted he had no clue when buses would arrive for the passengers.</p> <p>Inside the terminal, queues for those still expecting to depart were building rapidly. Many who had checked in remotely before the system died still wanted to drop bags. At 11.30am, after a two-hour wait, Sutherland was given a tag for his suitcase, but told the luggage belt wasn\u2019t working and he should take it to a porter in zone C. \u201cThere were thousands of bags there. It was unreal.\u201d</p> <p>That was the last time Sutherland saw his bag. He then joined thousands more unwary BA customers in going through security to departure-lounge hell.</p> <p>BA\u2019s Spanish chief executive, Alex Cruz, had by now arrived at the recently refurbished crisis command centre at BA\u2019s Waterside House HQ. Like most major airlines, BA has well-practised procedures for crisis management, with drills held up to four times a year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"67c79e1ec86580d2f7fa5f30b273f84ba9022203\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67c79e1ec86580d2f7fa5f30b273f84ba9022203/0_7_4134_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British Airways planes at Heathrow during the weekend of the shutdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British Airways planes at Heathrow during the weekend of the shutdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over eight-hour shifts, teams of senior managers would take their places at two horseshoe-shaped tables, holding conference calls with Heathrow\u2019s own crisis centre while facing a video wall showing BA\u2019s fleet and worldwide movements, news broadcasts, surges in Twitter activity \u2013 and planes going nowhere. But at the terminal, the lack of communications was heightening the crisis, leaving helpless staff faced with irate passengers and no information.</p> <p>Departure boards showed flights whose times had come and gone. BA\u2019s first tool for communicating with its increasingly bewildered customers, in and out of the airport, was Twitter, via its Newcastle-based social media team. But they couldn\u2019t keep up with customers tweeting their own devastating verdicts \u2013 holidays in tatters, elderly relatives stranded, even a Greek wedding now missing its bridesmaids and guests.</p> <p>Passengers at the airport were increasingly relying on word of mouth and online news, rather than airline staff. By 2.30pm, the media was reporting that no BA planes would fly from Heathrow or Gatwick before 6pm, a story rejected as \u201cfalse news\u201d in a rare announcement in the departure lounge. But within 20 minutes, a second announcement confirmed that all BA flights were indeed cancelled, at least until 6pm.</p> <p>Contingency plans were laid but, in the chaos, even escaping proved impossible, says Sutherland: \u201cThe UFC tried to book me on another flight at 5.30pm, but I couldn\u2019t even get to Terminal 2, because of the queues to get out.\u201d Huge lines formed at doors that were never opened; queues for claim forms stretched around the terminal, with many in the dark about their rights as the airline pledged to rebook them.</p> <p>Fischbacher-Smith, whose academic field is corporate risk and resilience, was getting a first-hand case study. \u201cI think people would have been more understanding had there been communication on the ground. Failure is one thing. The response is something else.\u201d</p> <p>At 6.30pm, Cruz\u2019s first Twitter broadcast identified a \u201cpower supply issue\u201d, thanked customers for their patience \u2013 and confirmed that all the rest of the day\u2019s flights were cancelled. The explanation only puzzled many further. Fischbacher-Smith says: \u201cIf there\u2019s such a significant vulnerability in the system, you\u2019d normally expect it to be tested and designed out of it. It\u2019s not uncommon for latent errors to be embedded in system design \u2013 but you\u2019d expect early warnings and near misses to be acted upon.\u201d</p> <p>And there had been warnings. Last July, a \u201cshort-lived problem with our check-in system\u201d, in BA\u2019s words, left passengers at its London airports delayed by up to four hours. In September, a second check-in failure in 12 weeks saw passengers given handwritten boarding passes amid lengthy queues \u2013 another reported \u201ccomputer glitch\u201d.</p> <p>Damian Brewer, analyst at RBC, wrote of this month\u2019s meltdown: \u201cIt is tempting but increasingly questionable to view this as a one-off. Across IAG, material operational failures seem to have become a recurring topic. This summer it is BA\u2019s IT meltdown, last year Vueling.\u201d</p> <p>Cruz was chief executive at Vueling, BA\u2019s sister airline in IAG, but moved to BA just before the Spanish low-cost airline cancelled scores of flights in a May 2016 weekend, leaving thousands grounded at its Barcelona base and prompting a government inquiry.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/08/delta-air-lines-flights-grounded-after-it-systems-failure\">Incidents at other carriers such as Delta</a> had vividly demonstrated the risks of an IT outage, so the explanation of a power issue seemed, Brewer added, to suggest \u201cfundamental management and planning weakness in BA\u201d.</p> <p>The problems came amid a growing narrative of costcutting at BA and parent company IAG that had left some observers wondering about the diminishing brand. Although the airline has dismissed any connection between the weekend\u2019s chaos and the outsourcing of jobs to India, the GMB union said it was \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d to see no link with BA\u2019s having made hundreds of experienced IT staff redundant.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/05/british-airways-ba-cabin-crew-begin-six-days-strikes\">A series of strikes by cabin crew in BA\u2019s \u201cmixed fleet\u201d branch </a>\u2013 set up during the bitter industrial dispute of 2011 and consisting entirely of new entrants \u2013 testified to simmering discontent among some staff. Another walkout has now been called for late June.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"620762fca7ee95a76131d705f5ce03a0f0f4d534\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/620762fca7ee95a76131d705f5ce03a0f0f4d534/0_0_5112_3067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A departure board in Haethrow Terminal 5.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A departure board in Haethrow Terminal 5.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Longstanding customers will have noted recent developments such as the axing of free food on short-haul flights, higher fares for flying with hold baggage, and the reconfiguration of some planes to shrink passengers\u2019 space.</p> <p>While Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, briskly rebuffs any notion of staff or customer discontent, pointing to growing passenger and job applicant numbers, even City analysts who applauded his efficiencies have started to wonder if the costcutting has gone too far. Among European airlines, BA has some of the lowest satisfaction scores for customers and staff, according to surveys by Glassdoor and Skytrax.</p> <p>Walsh\u2019s tough efficiencies have led to booming profits for IAG, with Iberia, the first partner in the 2011 merger, forced to slash its fleet and wage bill. The shares, 146p five years ago, are near an all-time high, closing at 607p on Friday, despite the previous weekend\u2019s debacle.</p> <p>Vueling and now Aer Lingus, where Walsh earned his reputation, make up the rest of the IAG fold in an industry where rivals such as Ryanair dominate the short-haul market. This week, IAG launched a long-haul, low-cost carrier, Level, out of Barcelona, following Norwegian\u2019s threat to its transatlantic market. The lines have become increasingly blurred, but while BA has cut costs to compete on fares, so far it still retains a significant brand loyalty.</p> <p>Whether that can survive many more events such as last weekend\u2019s fiasco is critical. Its Avios points scheme keeps many frequent flyers in BA\u2019s network, to the point where even some stranded travellers last week spoke only of \u201cquestioning their loyalty\u201d rather than vowing to switch. But aviation consultant Chris Tarry says: \u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive environment. When you lose those customers it costs a lot to win them back.\u201d</p> <p>Should the tens of thousands stranded that Saturday \u2013 and potentially the same number again delayed as the knock-on effects stretched into Monday \u2013 decide to switch, BA\u2019s loss could far outstrip the estimated \u00a3100m compensation bill.</p> <p>The worst of the debacle came to an end on the Saturday night, when the last of the passengers stuck airside filtered back through immigration, after the indignity of a two-hour queue at the border \u2013 having never left the airport.</p> <p>Heathrow staff, who had suffered Walsh\u2019s public ire during the last comparable public relations catastrophe, when the baggage system failed at the opening of Terminal 5, quietly handed out mats and blankets to passengers who opted to sleep in its halls. The rest of Heathrow was fully functioning, but, as an airport insider put it: \u201cFor BA, it was like someone had literally had flicked the switch.\u201d</p> <p>It may yet prove that they had done just that. Sutherland, meanwhile, emerged just before 10pm, returning to Gloucester without his case or laptop, never to make it to the Swedish fight night, with thousands lost in earnings.</p> <p>Five days later, although he was still waiting for a response to his many calls and messages to BA, he had a text saying his suitcase had arrived \u2013 in Stockholm.</p>",
