Obviously our minds were full of other things. You do the things you do. You have the turkey dinner and exchange presents, but it was very sombre. I just went to my bed on Christmas night about 10pm. I wasn\u2019t really in the mood. I found out [about City Link going into administration] on Christmas Eve, just about lunchtime. I got a call from the RMT [Ward is the local representative for the RMT trade union]. I was down in Ayr delivering parcels to my customers as I do every day. I then called my depot manager and it was denied. They were going around the office telling everybody: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, this is a load of nonsense.\u201d I sent my daughter a text message because I was quite upset. And I said: \u201cDon\u2019t say anything until it is 100% confirmed.\u201d And she was working next to people who were talking about Christmas and what they were doing and she knew. They were all in with their Christmas hats and jumpers and she knew: I\u2019ve got some horrible news and I can\u2019t tell you. I had kiddies\u2019 Christmas presents in the van so for the sake of them I carried on. I had medical goods in the van, we deliver a lot of medical supplies to people who have quite serious illnesses. And you can\u2019t just say you are not getting them. I had bikes in the back of the van and other toys. There is no point in spoiling Christmas for other people. On New Year\u2019s Eve I got it confirmed that talks had broken down and we were going to be made redundant. How did I feel? Just deflated. I spoke to my wife, spoke to my daughter, had a coffee and went to my bed. But I couldn\u2019t sleep. I\u2019ve never been so angry about anything in my life. I\u2019m normally a mild-mannered person, but this has made my blood boil. I am hopeful I can get something else but I don\u2019t know. It would be great if the three of us and my colleagues in Motherwell could get something. But who knows. The economic climate in Lanarkshire isn\u2019t too good. To make matters worse my wife is an agency worker for another company and she got laid off on Christmas Eve as well. She works with a food production company. She is waiting by the phone. They said stand by your phone and you might get a call in the new year. Mick Ward is a driver at the City Link depot at Motherwell, where his son is a forklift driver, and his daughter is a call centre manager for City Link at Cambuslang, near Glasgow.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "On New Year\u2019s Eve, more than 2,300 workers at City Link found out their jobs had been axed. But more than 1,000 self-employed van drivers and agency workers who earned a living from the failed parcel delivery firm will not receive a redundancy letter. John Baginton, a 54-year-old van driver, has had no communication from the company since he found out from a news website on Christmas Day that his job was gone. \u201cIt has left a bitter taste in my mouth. I still haven\u2019t had a letter or an email to say my job\u2019s finished. Nothing from head office to say \u2018thanks for your loyalty\u2019. They didn\u2019t even send a text message.\u201d Baginton, not his real name, was never counted as an employee by City Link. Although he worked for City Link, and its predecessor Direct Express, for nine years, he has never been on the payroll. In City Link parlance, he is a \u201cservice delivery partner\u201d. In other words, a contract worker with no guaranteed hours, sick pay, holiday pay or entitlement to redundancy. City Link owe him \u00a32,400 for three weeks\u2019 work. But he doesn\u2019t expect to see any of this money: \u201cI very much doubt it, as we will be the last of the last [on the creditors\u2019 list].\u201d Even after last-minute talks to save the firm failed, City Link was still advertising on its website for \u201cpassionate\u201d people who wanted to be their own boss. The firm, owned by multimillionaire Jon Moulton, claimed that drivers could earn \u00a343,000 a year. Phil Valentine, a contractor who has worked for City Link \u201con and off\u201d for six years and runs six vans, dismissed the \u00a343,000 figure. Once a driver paid for fuel, insurance and a weekly charge for a van, earnings would be more like \u00a328,000 a year. Baginton said: \u201cGross-wise it looks good, but net-wise you are probably looking at around half of that [\u00a343,000].\u201d Officially self-employed, he paid his own taxes and national insurance. Work started at 4.30 in the morning and sometimes didn\u2019t finish until 7.30 at night. Holidays were rare, because it was hard to find a replacement driver. \u201cIf we have two weeks\u2019 holiday, it will take us two months to recover. It is a double whammy. First because you lose your wages and second because you have to pay someone else to do your job.\u201d Illness was an even bigger problem. Last year, City Link docked him \u00a375 for missing a morning\u2019s work after he came down with food poisoning. \u201cI rang in sick the night before and I said I didn\u2019t feel well. They rang throughout the morning and asked \u2018where are you?\u2019\u201d He went in at lunchtime, still feeling unwell, but found out a week later he had been fined. \u201cI asked my boss: \u2018What\u2019s this charge for?\u2019 And he said it would have been \u00a3150 if I had missed the whole day. So I had gone in sick and I had basically worked for free. \u201cBefore Christmas I had a chest infection for two weeks and my wife was saying I should stay at home. But you can\u2019t. You have it at the back of your mind: \u2018I am going to get charged.\u2019\u201d City Link contract drivers are part of an army of self-employed labour that has boomed during the recession. Around 4.6 million people are self-employed in the UK, 15% of the working population, the highest proportion for 40 years, according to the Office for National Statistics. The biggest growth category for self employment is not consultants tapping away on laptops in cafes, but taxi drivers, carpenters and bricklayers. Delivery workers are not counted separately in the statistics, but there is little doubt their numbers have grown as Britons have embraced online shopping. Around 1.7bn parcels were delivered in the UK in 2012, up from 1.3bn in 2005, according to PWC. Amid fierce competition for a slice of the \u00a37bn parcel market, costs are being squeezed, especially as big customers, such as Amazon, develop their own delivery networks. \u201cThere is constant downward pressure on parcel carriers which they can only deal with by economies of scale,\u201d said one distribution industry source. Mike Parkinson, a City Link contractor who is owed \u00a37,500 for unpaid work, saw higher payments for early-morning deliveries dropped after Better Capital took control of the firm in 2013. He could be fined if he missed a delivery slot. Baginton was paid \u00a32.15 per delivery, no matter how many items were going to one house. \u201cI could have 20 parcels and that is classed as one stop and I get paid the same.\u201d Sometimes he delivered flat-pack furniture stamped with \u201c2-man lift\u201d for the same \u00a32.15 rate he would be paid for delivering a T-shirt. Mike Cain, an employment lawyer at Slater &amp; Gordon, who successfully fought for compensation for warehouse workers and delivery drivers working for the collapsed Comet retail business, said: \u201cSelf-employed contracts are playing a major part in the so-called economic revival. Under such contracts, worker rights and access to legal protection are minimised if not removed altogether and the risk and the costs if a business fails are being shifted downwards.\u201d Trade unions are worried this model will spread to the whole industry, including the Royal Mail, now in private hands. \u201cWhile the parcel market has grown quickly, so too has the number of operators at an even faster rate. The same principle applies to post and the UK\u2019s 650-year-old post operator, Royal Mail, faces intense pressure of its own,\u201d said Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union. He accuses the regulator, Ofcom, of shirking its responsibilities by failing to apply standards to fledgling companies that will do anything to undercut the Royal Mail. \u201cOne of the worst impacts of Ofcom\u2019s current approach to let the free market have its head is the downward pressure they support, to reduce pay and terms and conditions, and encourage a race to the bottom for workers.\u201d Ofcom said parliament was ultimately responsible for regulating workers\u2019 rights. \u201cOfcom has a duty to secure the universal service for postal users. We do not regulate terms of employment, which are for individual companies to determine.\u201d The department of business, innovation and skills said the government was conducting a review into \u201chow to make a person\u2019s employment status clearer and how this affects their employment rights\u201d. \u201cWorkers and businesses should be free to agree the terms of an employment relationship and the government does not want to restrict people\u2019s ability to choose how they work. This ensures a flexible and vibrant labour market, supporting growth and delivering jobs.\u201d Meanwhile, Baginton is consulting a solicitor friend for advice about his rights. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government realise what this job entails,\u201d he says.",

He accuses the regulator, Ofcom, of shirking its responsibilities by failing to apply standards to fledgling companies that will do anything to undercut the Royal Mail. \u201cOne of the worst impacts of Ofcom\u2019s current approach to let the free market have its head is the downward pressure they support, to reduce pay and terms and conditions, and encourage a race to the bottom for workers.\u201d</p> <p>Ofcom said parliament was ultimately responsible for regulating workers\u2019 rights. \u201cOfcom has a duty to secure the universal service for postal users. We do not regulate terms of employment, which are for individual companies to determine.\u201d</p> <p>The department of business, innovation and skills said the government was conducting a review into \u201chow to make a person\u2019s employment status clearer and how this affects their employment rights\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWorkers and businesses should be free to agree the terms of an employment relationship and the government does not want to restrict people\u2019s ability to choose how they work. This ensures a flexible and vibrant labour market, supporting growth and delivering jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Baginton is consulting a solicitor friend for advice about his rights. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government realise what this job entails,\u201d he says.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For a large endowment fund with a seemingly conservative approach to investing, the returns generated by the \u00a318bn Wellcome Trust are extraordinary. The gain for the past financial year \u2013 15.4%, or \u00a32.5bn \u2013 continued a run that stretches back years. Over the past six years since the financial crisis, the trust has generated 81%, or \u00a39bn. That equates to 10.4% per annum, roughly the trust\u2019s 20-year average. Since the start of the investment portfolio in 1985, the average is 14% a year. It\u2019s clearly no fluke. What\u2019s the secret? One short answer is long investment horizons. \u201cWe are an asset owner not a fund manager,\u201d says Danny Truell, chief investment officer. \u201cWe buy businesses, we don\u2019t buy share prices. When we buy a business we enter into, and we maintain, a targeted return over the next decade and we are indifferent to short-term mark-to-market movements.\u201d Two remarkable statistics illustrate the point. First, Wellcome Trust\u2019s 31-strong portfolio of shares in \u201cmega-cap\u201d multinationals \u2013 one of the main pillars of the investment strategy \u2013 contains exactly the same names as two years ago; no company has been added or removed in that time. Second, the adventures into the spicier worlds of venture capital and private equity do not end when the companies go public. Wellcome Trust has never sold a share in a flotation. Thus stakes in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, and Twitter \u2013 acquired when those firms were smaller and private \u2013 remain in the portfolio. Can anybody invest like this? Or do you have to be part of an organisation that dates back to 1936 and Henry Wellcome\u2019s creation of the Wellcome Group, owner of the drug company that eventually created the first $1bn drug (Zovirax) in 1981 and was then sold to Glaxo in 1995? \u201cI think is predominately a mindset,\u201d says Truell. \u201cIt is a mindset that believes that compounding cash flows over time is the most effective form of investment. It is partly also the mindset of the organisation. I have a board that consists mainly of very eminent scientists who are very empathetic to the view that you make progress over years and decades, not over the next quarter.\u201d The endowment exists to fund medical research. Grants last year totalled \u00a3690m. Thanks to the recent strong investment performance, the trust now expects its charitable spending to be \u00a34bn in the next half-decade, up from \u00a33bn over the past five years. Investment style If the investment style is so successful, why don\u2019t more pension fund trustees, who by rights should also be looking to the long-term, copy it? \u201cThe [pension] fund trustees may wish to think long-term but when they are investing through managers who they are judging on a short-term view that\u2019s where there can be a breakdown between the intent and the outcome,\u201d says Truell. Truell also chairs the World Economic Forum\u2019s long-term investor council, which comprises some of the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth funds and state pension funds. \u201cI think it is fair to say that all are moving in the direction of how to be genuinely long-term investors and how they also get more control over their own destiny by doing things directly rather than through third parties,\u201d he says. The Wellcome Trust itself is managing a greater portion of its assets directly but still uses up to 50 partners in areas where it feels it has no expertise, such as early-stage venture capital, running hedge funds or investing across many classes of assets in Asia. \u201cThere are skills that we have and there are skills that we don\u2019t have, and we are fairly hard-nosed about identifying them,\u201d says Truell. The early investments in Facebook, Twitter and Alibaba came via contacts at such partners. The valuations of some of those firms strike many people as stratospheric but Truell is sanguine. The share prices of Twitter and Alibaba \u201cran a bit too hard\u201d after IPO and he thinks short-sellers in the hedge fund world have done a good job in spotting froth: \u201cYou saw in March this year there was a bit of a bubble and, actually, the hedge funds did a good job in pushing prices down to more realistic levels.\u201d He argues that Facebook and Twitter (where Wellcome\u2019s holdings were worth \u00a3102m and \u00a3194m respectively at the end of September) are very different businesses. \u201cFacebook is a platform. It\u2019s got that global penetration. Twitter is about content, which if it works, is more valuable than platform. What it must not do is downplay the quality of its content. Challenges \u201cThe world is working through the question, \u2018Is it about the number of people who tweet, or is it about the quality of what is tweeted?\u2019 There was a period when it was about the former, and I think it is moving towards the latter. Though, clearly, as you have seen in 2014, Facebook has done well and Twitter has not done well. There are always going to be challenges to these businesses but, if they get it right, potential valuations are by no means demanding.\u201d At Alibaba (a \u00a3115m holding at year-end), outsiders\u2019 worries tend to focus on corporate governance and the fact the management own businesses in a private capacity that trade with the public entity. Truell suggests part of his confidence stems from having been invested in Alibaba since 2011. \u201cWe would say that no company can say it is absolutely free of governance issues but the fact is that they are at least cognisant of them.\u201d The bulk of the \u201cmega-cap\u201d portfolio is concentrated in longer-established names. UK-listed companies include Marks &amp; Spencer, HSBC, Shell, Vodafone, BP, Unilever, GlaxoSmithKline, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton. Tobacco companies are the only ones excluded on ethical grounds. Some environmental campaigners would also like to see oil companies deemed off-limits by socially minded investors. Truell, however, starts from the premise that energy is essential to the global economy and argues that engagement is better than disengagement. \u201cAs far as we are concerned, it is not realistic that we can dispense with fossil fuels. If I look today at a company like Shell, which has argued in favour of the carbon tax, is making major investments into carbon capture, and whose revenues now come predominately from gas rather than oil, it is very important that we engage with companies to ensure that they are being realistic about the changes in the nature of the energy market.\u201d In what circumstances does Wellcome Trust sell an investment? \u201cIt does not happen very often but essentially if we feel that a business model is challenged and the company is not responding.\u201d Finnish mobile phone maker Nokia was an example. \u201cIt had produced very popular products and then it just lost its way and it got into internal turmoil about producing new products. And, unfortunately, in a sector like technology the failure to produce the right products is something that can be severely damaging very quickly. Fortunately we realised that in time and we exited the investment.\u201d Strong returns Despite the trust\u2019s strong returns since the great financial crash of 2008-09, Truell suggests that the going is likely to get harder from here. \u201cValuations since then have moved from being depressed to being fairly to fully valued, hence returns from here will be driven by organic growth rather than revaluation,\u201d he says. For the time being Wellcome Trust will retain its bias towards the US, which accounts for 60% of the assets and has been one big driver of outperformance in the past half-decade. He says it is \u201cstill unclear\u201d how Japan will respond to aggressive quantitative easing. Europe is still \u201cfar away\u201d from resolving its structural problems. \u201cIn many countries, including the UK, France, Spain and Italy, populist politics appear to have largely derailed progress in driving public-sector supply-side reforms to restore fiscal balance through greater efficiencies,\u201d he wrote in the trust\u2019s annual report. Thus both the euro and sterling are vulnerable to further falls against the dollar, he thinks. The Russian crisis developed after the Wellcome Trust\u2019s year-end, but Truell is gloomy about prospects there. \u201cI think it is quite difficult to see what they are going to do, and I don\u2019t think we can rule out the imposition of capital controls. But they do have substantial foreign reserves so the real challenge is maintaining the credibility of the banking system. \u201cSo far we have seen the currency come under severe pressure but it does not appear yet that there has been a major withdrawal of deposits from the banking system and that is obviously the challenge. So it is making sure that there is liquidity in the banking system that is really the key to allowing the crisis to simmer down and let time have its effect. I think they have a credible cental bank governor [Elvira Nabiullina]. I think she is good.\u201d Wellcome Trust has no direct investments in Russia and, by the sounds of it, that will remain the case. Instead, the most interesting new investment in the past year was the \u00a3249m purchase of the Co-op Group\u2019s farms in the UK. It was a very Wellcome-type of deal \u2013 expand into an under-invested agricultural sector and take a \u201cmulti-decade\u201d view of returns.",
