      "bodyText": "Figures from China showing that factory output contracted for a 10th straight month in December pointed to a continuation of 2015\u2019s global economic slowdown and the likelihood of worse to come. Separate figures revealed India suffered a shock fall in manufacturing output in the month before Christmas. To cap it all, factory figures from the US showed that the world\u2019s largest economy can catch a cold when China sneezes. Far from being immune, US factories reported declines in new orders and, without an upturn in sight, large scale layoffs. Investors, spooked by the rash of bad news, raced towards safe havens to stash their money. Gold prices jumped and the Swedish krona, long considered a safe currency, soared to new highs before the country\u2019s central bank threatened to intervene to prevent a further appreciation. Stock markets, including Tokyo, New York and London, tumbled. Oil prices, which have slumped in recent months to an 11-year low, were caught in the Saudi Arabia-Iran row, with buyers first sniffing a war that would limit supplies, sending prices higher, before deciding that Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest producer, would want to keep pumping the black stuff to maintain low prices to hurt Iran\u2019s oil revenues. Some analysts have likened the current turmoil to the third and final act of the 2008 banking crisis. After the bank bailouts that crippled the west and the subsequent austerity, which delayed the recovery, the colossal borrowing by developing world nations must be reined in. Beijing borrowed heavily to maintain production in the wake of the crash and has attempted to limit lending since 2014, especially to state enterprises, many of them large-scale manufacturers, and local authorities that fund construction. Re-shaping of the economy away from steel and copper smelting to a more westernised service economy was always going to cause jitters in world markets that have become dependent on cheap Chinese goods. Yet that is little comfort to manufacturing businesses in all corners of the globe attempting to plan for the future. What level of investment should they adopt and how many workers will they need? Low oil prices are a huge boon, making everything from energy to transport costs cheaper. But dwindling demand for goods worldwide is a bigger factor in the investment equation than cheaper supplies, which is why the UK steel industry has already shed 5,000 workers and many more are at risk outside Britain\u2019s golden circle of aerospace builders, car makers and pharmaceutical firms.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "HSBC will not face formal action from the City regulator following revelations that the Swiss arm of Britain\u2019s biggest bank helped clients to evade tax. HSBC was engulfed in scandal a year ago when leaked bank account details showed how the bank\u2019s Swiss unit helped wealthy customers to dodge taxes by concealing assets and handing out bundles of cash to avoid the authorities. At the time, the Financial Conduct Authority said it was looking at the working practices inside the bank after admitting it had learned about the details of the activities in the Swiss bank from the reports in the Guardian and other publications. However, the FCA has now concluded that review and will not take formal action against HSBC. The FCA would not comment on the decision, first reported by Sky News, butit said in February 2015 that the leak of the bank account details \u201chas served to reinforce the importance of firms operating with the right culture across all of their operations\u201d. Martin Wheatley, the then chief executive of the FCA, said: \u201cThe allegations are about a Swiss unit of the bank, based on events of predominantly 2005-2007 ... We are very closely monitoring the ability of the bank overall \u2026 and we think significant improvements have been made\u201d. Wheatley resigned in July when George Osborne did not renew his contract, sparking speculation that the chancellor wanted to take a softer stance towards the City. A successor for Wheatley has not been named and the regulator ended 2015 facing criticism of its decision to end a review of culture at banks that had been outlined in its business plan earlier in the year. HSBC, which declined to comment on Monday, has repeatedly said it has changed its practices, including an overhaul of its structure that began in 2011. Last year, the Geneva authorities instructed HSBC to pay a record 40m Swiss francs (\u00a328m) for \u201corganisational deficiencies\u201d. A month ago, Herv\u00e9 Falciani, an IT expert, was sentenced to five years in prison by a Swiss court for aggravated industrial espionage, data theft and violation of commercial and banking secrecy. Falciani was convicted in his absence and did not attend the trial. HSBC is currently reviewing whether to keep its headquarters in the UK, where it has been based since the early 1990s following the takeover of Midland Bank. The outcome is expected early this year. The bank has published 11 factors it will consider during the review, which include the government\u2019s tax policy and attitude to financial services companies. The FCA decision emerged as the bank\u2019s UK arm \u2013 which has 17 million customers \u2013 tweeted on Monday that people were having problems logging on to online and mobile banking services. Towards the end of the day, it tweeted: \u201cPersonal banking customers should now be able to access the mobile app, although we continue to work on a fix for desktop users\u201d. It is the latest IT problem for a big bank. On New Year\u2019s Day, Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s customers had problems using their debit cards in shops.",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 1.6% after staging a late rally. It was still its worst post-New Year performance in eight years. The Dow had been down 2.5% in the morning, a new year trading dip unseen since 1922 when the markets closed down 2.3% on the first day of trading after the holidays. The S&amp;P 500 lost 30.88 points, or 1.51%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 104.32 points, or 2.08%. The New Year\u2019s rout started after a closely watched survey of China\u2019s vast manufacturing sector showed it shrank for a 10th month running. In China, shares were suspended after a drop of 7% activated \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d on their very first day. The Shanghai Composite Index ended 6.9% lower. Investors across the world joined the sell off. In London, the FTSE 100 lost 2.4%, its worst opening day to a new year in 16 years and the second-worst on record. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 lost 2.8% and Germany\u2019s Dax lost 4.3%, its weakest start to a trading year in the history of the index. In Brazil, the real fell 2% against the dollar and Brazilian equities dropped 1.6% to 42,646.19, the lowest since 16 March 2007, as investors worried the country will fall deeper into recession. Moody\u2019s Investors services is currently reviewing the country\u2019s debt and is soon expected to downgrade its rating to junk amid the country\u2019s political and economic crisis. Moody\u2019s rivals Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s and Fitch made the cut to junk last year. With all this bad news US markets looked set to open with a sell off even before the opening bell for trading was rung. Compounding woes from China the latest report on the state of the he manufacturing sector from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) proved weaker than expected. ISM\u2019s index fell to 48.2 in December from 48.6 in November, its lowest level since 2009. A level above 50 indicates growth and analysts had been expecting a rise. \u201cThe US manufacturing sector is dangerously close to recession and, given the dollar\u2019s continued appreciation, we don\u2019t anticipate any significant improvement until the second half of this year,\u201d Capital Economics\u2019 US economist Steve Murphy wrote in a note to clients. Oil rose, briefly, after months of falls. Rising tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran following the execution of Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr led to speculation that oil supply could tighten. But oil soon lost those gains as investors bet that continuing oversupply would outstrip demand.",

      "bodyText": "UK factories entered 2016 in a \u201cstate of near stagnation\u201d following a decline in output growth and new orders during December. Firms blamed the weaker than expected growth on falling demand for consumer goods and machine tools, which have experienced a long slowdown in growth since a peak in 2014 apart from a recovery in the summer. The disappointing figures from the pre-Christmas period meant Britain\u2019s total manufacturing production over 2015 was lower than the previous year, according to the closely watched Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply/Markit purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) survey. Seen alongside the official figures, which have shown outright declines in manufacturing output since last March, the figures will spook ministers concerned that Britain\u2019s recovery is skewed towards the services sector and the consumption of imported goods. The PMI survey posted a reading of 51.9 in December - where 50 separates growth from contraction. This is down from 52.5 in November and the sector\u2019s 16-month peak of 55.5 in October. Economists had expected growth in December to come in at 52.8. However, the report pointed out that a 33rd consecutive month of expansion, which contrasts with many continental economies, was underpinned by higher domestic orders and exports to continental Europe, the US and China. The report said the consumer goods sector remained the prime driver of production and new order growth, despite seeing its rates of expansion ease over the month. It added that manufacturing costs continued to fall at a sharp pace during December, due to declines in the prices of oil and other commodities. Martin Beck, the senior economic adviser to the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, said: \u201cManufacturing activity appears to have ended 2015 in a state of near stagnation. \u201cThe weakening was broad based, with the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sub-sectors all seeing a deceleration in growth. Meanwhile, the rise in export orders was the weakest since September.\u201d He added that the recent boost to manufacturers from the drop in the price of oil, down almost 13% in December on the previous month, still left them struggling against the headwinds of sterling\u2019s previous strength and problems in the world economy. \u201cLooking ahead manufacturing looks set to play firmly second fiddle to services in driving growth in 2016. However, the weakening in the pound since the autumn, as well as a modest pickup in global activity, should assist manufacturers selling abroad or competing with imports.\u201d Business groups have long pointed to the high pound and a lack of access for small and medium sized firms to bank finance as the main barriers to growth in the sector. Sterling remains high against the euro, which has come under pressure in the last year from the concerted actions of the European Central Bank to print money and drive down the value of the eurozone currency. Rob Dobson, the senior economist at Markit, said: \u201cThis suggests that industry will make, at best, only a marginal positive contribution to broader economic growth in the final quarter of the year.\u201d Manufacturing accounts for about 10% of the UK economy.",

Priory Group, which consists of the original south-west London clinic and more than 300 other sites in the UK, has been bought by Acadia Healthcare for \u00a31.28bn from private equity group Advent.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Just a strong reaction to a weak set of Chinese factory data? Slow manufacturing numbers were a trigger for Monday\u2019s China-inspired falls in stock markets around the globe, but the worries were also fuelled by memories of Beijing\u2019s cack-handed attempts to prop up share prices last summer. Nobody wants a see another shambolic exercise in state-sponsored market intervention, but a repeat performance is a possibility. To refresh memories, a 30% fall in the Shanghai Composite Index over a few weeks last May and June prompted a series of emergency measures that, if attempted in the west, would have been deemed ridiculous. State-backed investment funds spent billions buying stocks. Notionally independent stockbrokers and fund managers were encouraged to join in. Finance houses dished out cheap loans to private investors to bet on recovery. It was an extraordinary response to what looked, to most outsiders, like a healthy correction in a stock market that had climbed too high, too quickly. The Shanghai Composite had previously gained 150% in a year and no market can sustain that pace. Being generous, one could say the state-funded intervention to \u201cuphold market stability\u201d worked. Share prices indeed stabilised and Beijing got a pat on the back from the supposedly free-market International Monetary Fund for preventing a \u201cdisorderly\u201d market. The Shanghai Composite ended 2015 up 9% on the year. The problem, though, is that artificial props under share prices can be hard to remove. Worse, they sometimes require reinforcement if the old cracks are still apparent. That point may be arriving, since one factor behind Monday\u2019s selling was the fear that large institutions will dump shares when the ban on sales is lifted soon. Investors\u2019 underlying confidence in valuations, it seems, is weak. Another contributor was the newly created \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d, another product of last summer\u2019s drama. Trading was suspended for 15 minutes after a 5% fall in the main index. When trading resumed, prices quickly hit the 7% cut-off point to halt trading for the day, a predictable response. Do circuit breakers calm nerves and allow cool heads to prevail, which is the ambition, or do they merely intensify panic when markets reopen? We\u2019ll find out in coming days. But, by most conventional yardsticks, Chinese stock markets are still severely overvalued. If prices continue to slide, it is easy to imagine another round of demands for the authorities to rescue investors in the name of stability and prevent a broader loss of confidence among over-borrowed households. In reality, Beijing would be silly to get back on the intervention treadmill. In the end, the only sure way to create a stable stock market is to allow prices to find their own level. Far-sightedness, however, requires the authorities in a state-controlled economy to accept that share prices do not march to ordained scripts. There is no evidence that Beijing has accepted that lesson from last summer. No wonder investors elsewhere are worried. Less than direct with investors Sports Direct is in the \u201cclarification\u201d business. In this instance, it wants to make clear that Michael Murray, the 26-year-old boyfriend of founder Mike Ashley\u2019s daughter, is not a director of any Sports Direct company. Since nobody had suggested otherwise (instead, Murray was described as a director of three Ashley-linked companies outside Sports Direct) it is odd that the sportswear retailer felt annoyed. So what is Murray\u2019s role at Sports Direct itself? Investors were told he \u201cheads up\u201d the property team in the UK and abroad and has the task of finding new sites for the chain\u2019s larger-format stores and its shop-plus-gym units. It\u2019s a big job since the company is said to be spending \u00a3250m on expansion. It is also a job that most FTSE 100 retailers would hand to an experienced property specialist on a full-time basis. But Murray\u2019s services are secured via a consultancy agreement and he is paid up to 25% of the \u201cincreased value\u201d that Sports Direct\u2019s non-executive directors judge to be created. Why is the youthful Murray the best person for this role? How on earth do the non-executives go about calculating the \u201cincreased value\u201d of a property purchase? And will shareholders be told the outcome of their deliberations? At that point, Sports Direct\u2019s clarifications cease. The company declined to answer all three questions. Outside shareholders must therefore accept the possibility that millions of pounds will be paid as a success fee to the boyfriend of the boss\u2019s daughter without outsiders being told the basis of the payments. Ashley owns 55% of the shares, so presumably can ignore all complaints from his outside investors. But to describe Monday\u2019s statement as a clarification is a joke. Persimmon payout is too much, too soon Mike Farley, former chief executive of Persimmon, left the housebuilder in April 2013 with \u201cour gratitude and best wishes for his retirement\u201d, as his chairman put it at the time. Warm words were appropriate since Persimmon, under Farley, was one of the few big UK housebuilders that did not require a bailout by its shareholders during the 2008-2011 downturn.

Slow manufacturing numbers were a trigger for Monday\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/04/china-manufacturing-slowdown-ftse-100-stocks-markets\">China-inspired falls in stock markets around the globe</a>, but the worries were also fuelled by memories of Beijing\u2019s cack-handed attempts to prop up share prices last summer. Nobody wants a see another <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/16/why-chinas-stock-market-bubble-was-always-bound-burst\">shambolic exercise in state-sponsored market intervention</a>, but a repeat performance is a possibility.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/04/factory-figures-make-for-grim-reading-as-global-stock-markets-fall\">Factory figures make for grim reading as global stock markets fall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To refresh memories, a 30% fall in the Shanghai Composite Index over a few weeks last May and June prompted a series of emergency measures that, if attempted in the west, would have been deemed ridiculous. State-backed investment funds spent billions buying stocks. Notionally independent stockbrokers and fund managers were encouraged to join in. Finance houses dished out cheap loans to private investors to bet on recovery.</p> <p>It was an extraordinary response to what looked, to most outsiders, like a healthy correction in a stock market that had climbed too high, too quickly. The Shanghai Composite had previously gained 150% in a year and no market can sustain that pace.</p> <p>Being generous, one could say the state-funded intervention to \u201cuphold market stability\u201d worked. Share prices indeed stabilised and Beijing got a pat on the back from the supposedly free-market International Monetary Fund for preventing a \u201cdisorderly\u201d market. The Shanghai Composite ended 2015 up 9% on the year.</p> <p>The problem, though, is that artificial props under share prices can be hard to remove. Worse, they sometimes require reinforcement if the old cracks are still apparent. That point may be arriving, since one factor behind Monday\u2019s selling was the fear that large institutions will dump shares when the ban on sales is lifted soon. Investors\u2019 underlying confidence in valuations, it seems, is weak.</p> <p>Another contributor was the newly created \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d, another product of last summer\u2019s drama. Trading was suspended for 15 minutes after a 5% fall in the main index. When trading resumed, prices quickly hit the 7% cut-off point to halt trading for the day, a predictable response. Do circuit breakers calm nerves and allow cool heads to prevail, which is the ambition, or do they merely intensify panic when markets reopen?</p> <p>We\u2019ll find out in coming days. But, by most conventional yardsticks, Chinese stock markets are still severely overvalued. If prices continue to slide, it is easy to imagine another round of demands for the authorities to rescue investors in the name of stability and prevent a broader loss of confidence among over-borrowed households.</p> <p>In reality, Beijing would be silly to get back on the intervention treadmill. In the end, the only sure way to create a stable stock market is to allow prices to find their own level. Far-sightedness, however, requires the authorities in a state-controlled economy to accept that share prices do not march to ordained scripts. There is no evidence that Beijing has accepted that lesson from last summer. No wonder investors elsewhere are worried.</p> <h2>Less than direct with investors</h2> <p>Sports Direct is in the \u201cclarification\u201d business. In this instance,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/04/sports-direct-stock-exchange-statement-property-boss-michael-murray\"> it wants to make clear that Michael Murray, the 26-year-old boyfriend of founder Mike Ashley\u2019s daughter, is not a director of any Sports Direct company</a>. Since nobody had suggested otherwise (instead, Murray was described as a director of three Ashley-linked companies outside Sports Direct) it is odd that the sportswear retailer felt annoyed.</p> <p>So what is Murray\u2019s role at Sports Direct itself? Investors were told he \u201cheads up\u201d the property team in the UK and abroad and has the task of finding new sites for the chain\u2019s larger-format stores and its shop-plus-gym units. It\u2019s a big job since the company is said to be spending \u00a3250m on expansion. </p> <p>It is also a job that most FTSE 100 retailers would hand to an experienced property specialist on a full-time basis. But Murray\u2019s services are secured via a consultancy agreement and he is paid up to 25% of the \u201cincreased value\u201d that Sports Direct\u2019s non-executive directors judge to be created.</p> <p>Why is the youthful Murray the best person for this role? How on earth do the non-executives go about calculating the \u201cincreased value\u201d of a property purchase? And will shareholders be told the outcome of their deliberations?</p> <p>At that point, Sports Direct\u2019s clarifications cease. The company declined to answer all three questions. Outside shareholders must therefore accept the possibility that millions of pounds will be paid as a success fee to the boyfriend of the boss\u2019s daughter without outsiders being told the basis of the payments.</p> <p>Ashley owns 55% of the shares, so presumably can ignore all complaints from his outside investors. But to describe Monday\u2019s statement as a clarification is a joke.</p> <h2>Persimmon payout is too much, too soon</h2> <p>Mike Farley, former chief executive of Persimmon, left the housebuilder in April 2013 with \u201cour gratitude and best wishes for his retirement\u201d, as his chairman put it at the time. Warm words were appropriate since Persimmon, under Farley, was one of the few big UK housebuilders that did not require a bailout by its shareholders during the 2008-2011 downturn.</p> <p>But Farley departed with more than mere thanks. He was also granted a slice of Persimmon\u2019s grand 2012-22 incentive scheme, even though he was at the helm for less than a year of the performance period. His portion is now worth \u00a316m and was delivered on New Year\u2019s Eve even though the scheme runs to 2022. The award is indefensible: if the boss left after one lap of a 10-lap race, why should he get a prize?</p>",

      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 index had \u00a338bn wiped off its value as global stock markets started the year with a rout sparked by fresh fears over the Chinese economy. Investors returning after the Christmas break were greeted by turmoil on stock exchanges, with Germany\u2019s share index posting its worst start to a new year on record and London\u2019s FTSE 100 putting in its second-worst start. As European markets closed, Wall Street looked set for the sharpest new year losses since the 1930s. The sell-off rippled out from China, where news of weakness in the vast factory sector and a faltering yuan sent Chinese shares on the CSI300 index tumbling 7%, forcing trading to be halted. There was further pressure on the country\u2019s stock market as investors anticipated the end of a ban on share sales by big stakeholders this week. The deep losses and the share suspension \u2013 which came on the first day that China\u2019s so-called \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d came into effect \u2013 helped send the FTSE 100 down 2.4%, or 149 points, to 6,093. Germany\u2019s Dax was down more than 4% and France\u2019s Cac 40 fell 2.5%. Oil prices were also volatile as tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran sent Brent crude soaring in early trade only for prices to fall later on. In the US, the Dow Jones industrial average had lost 2.4% by the time London markets closed. It ended the day 1.6% down, its worst opening to a new year since 2008. \u201cAnyone hitting the trading floor expecting a calm and quiet start to 2016 was given a rude surprise as Asian chaos affected European markets,\u201d said Alastair McCaig, market analyst at online trading company IG. \u201cThis swift return to the 2015 template of worrying about China looks to have been the trigger for the sell-off in Chinese equities. It is the first time Chinese regulators have activated the suspension in trading as a circuit breaker safety measure. Starting the year off by suspending trading an hour and a half early on the back of a 7% fall has set an ugly precedent for the year ahead.\u201d The drop in Chinese stocks followed a business survey that suggested manufacturing activity in China contracted for the 10th successive month in December and at a faster pace than the previous month. An official survey of the factory sector last week pointed to a further slowdown in December, adding to worries that, despite a series of interventions by authorities, the world\u2019s second largest economy will slow further in 2016 and put further pressure on global growth. Traders said Chinese stock markets were also weighed down by investors selling shares ahead of the imminent ending of a share sales ban on listed companies\u2019 major shareholders, which was brought in during the market crash last summer. The oil price had a volatile session, as the signals from China, the world\u2019s biggest energy consumer, offset traders\u2019 predictions that tensions between Saudia Arabia and Iran could upset supply. Brent crude turned negative in afternoon trading, down 0.4% at $37.14, having earlier added more than a dollar to $38.99 a barrel. Analysts at the consultancy Capital Economics said the tensions in the Middle East were unlikely to provide a lasting boost to oil prices. \u201cAmple global stocks of crude and higher production elsewhere mean that geopolitical risks from the Middle East are not as great as they once were,\u201d they wrote in a note. \u201cWe suspect a sustained recovery in oil prices will have to depend on production cuts outside OPEC and on signs of stronger global demand. These, rather than fresh disruption to supply from the Middle East, are the key factors behind our end-2016 forecast of $55 for a barrel of Brent.\u201d In the UK, China\u2019s waning growth has weighed on confidence among exporters. There were further signs of weakness for British factories on Monday, with a survey appearing to confirm 2015 was slower than 2014. The year closed on a sluggish note, defying City expectations of a small bounce-back in December. As British manufacturers fret about the effects of a strong pound and softer overseas demand, new orders came in at the slowest pace for five months, according to the latest Markit/Cips purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The report\u2019s main activity index slipped to 51.9 in December from 52.5 in November. It was above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction but undershot forecasts of a 52.7 reading in a Reuters poll of economists. The business survey painted a slightly brighter picture than official figures, which showed manufacturing was in recession last year. Surveys from manufacturing in the eurozone showed business picked up in December offering some glimmers of hope for UK factories exporting to the single currency bloc.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Stavros Staikos thinks of the year ahead, he expresses dread. Although stoic in demeanour, the retired merchant seaman struggles to be upbeat about his country and his own circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be optimistic,\u201d he says, waiting his turn for financial advice in the central Athens branch of the Union of Consumers and Borrowers. \u201cWho\u2019d have thought it would come to this? Who\u2019d have thought that at the age of 63, I\u2019d be worried sick about losing my home.\u201d Like an odyssey without end, Greece\u2019s great economic crisis goes on and the predicament of people such as Staikos is igniting new fears of social unrest. Last year was tumultuous, punctuated by two elections, a referendum, the imposition of capital controls, negotiations to reach a bailout deal, cliffhanger parliamentary votes and Athens\u2019 closest brush yet with bankruptcy and euro exit. But 2016 could be more unpredictable still. The hardest, many agree, is yet to come, even if Greeks have stared into the abyss and accepted there is no alternative to the constraints of membership of the eurozone. \u201cJust when a lot of people thought it couldn\u2019t get worse, it seems it can,\u201d says Toula Thanopoulou, the director of the Union of Borrowers and Consumers. \u201cWe are seeing people in really bad shape psychologically. They are incredibly scared that the next step will be banks taking away their homes. The government says all will be well, but the problem is no one believes it.\u201d The question now being asked, as the thrice bailed-out nation heads into its most difficult winter yet, is whether Greece will ever be able to bounce back. Six years into the country\u2019s morale-sapping debt drama, the omens are mixed. Ushering in the new year, prime minister Alexis Tsipras predicted that 2016 marked the beginning of the end, \u201ca final exit from economic crisis\u201d. With a financial lifeline sealed via an \u20ac86bn (\u00a363bn) aid package from the International Monetary Fund, EU and the European Central Bank, the country could look ahead to radical change and \u201cnational rebirth\u201d. But not everyone is buying into the success story. More than 55% of Greeks signalled pessimism over the future in a recent poll. Another 61% thought their country\u2019s enforced ejection from the eurozone remains a distinct possibility. Alongside the rise in pessimism, the events of the past 12 months have exacerbated Greece\u2019s economic trauma: unemployment has soared above 30% and disposable income has plummeted by more than 25%. However, after years of make-or-break deadlines and emergency summits, this is a nation that has learned to deal with adversity. It has accepted that, trapped in a vicious cycle of austerity and debt, salvation will not be easy as it copes with the effects of spending cuts, including hospitals and schools operating on skeletal staff. \u201cThe risk for the country now is an anaemic recovery, unable to bring down unemployment and put the real economy back on track,\u201d says Theodore Pelagidis, economics professor at the university of Piraeus and a fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank. But this year will see the Greek state and its citizens pushed further by its three lenders, who have demanded reforms in exchange for assistance. In the weeks ahead, Athens must overhaul the country\u2019s pension system, enforce higher taxes on farmers and forge ahead with aprivatisation programme. The measures will test the resolve of Europe\u2019s first leftwing administration to enact neo-liberal reforms. From being the party of resistance when it was catapulted into power last January, the anti-austerity Syriza party led by Tsipras has become the political force that will oversee implementation of the country\u2019s most painful bailout programme. The middle class, hit so hard by the rigours of fiscal adjustment in the form of repeated tax hikes, budget and spending cuts, will feel the pain again as the gap between rich and poor grows ever wider. Farmers, never shy of erecting tractor roadblocks, are threatening \u201cwar.\u201d Trade unions are girding for battle and the overhaul of the pension system \u2013 seen as essential if savings worth \u20ac1.8bn or 1% of GDP are to be delivered this year \u2013 will hit households that depend on retirement income. The prospect of banks repossessing homes \u2013 an inevitability if international creditors insist on enforcing measures reducing mortgage debtors\u2019 protections \u2013 has further stoked fears of social upheaval. From government quarters, defiance is already being heard. Tsipras recently declared his opposition to the continued participation of the IMF in Athens\u2019 bailout programme when current aid disbursements expire in March. In advance of the new round of negotiations over the bailout reforms, he announced at the weekend that his coalition government, in partnership with the populist rightwing Independent Greeks party, would not be caving in to \u201cunreasonable and unfair demands\u201d. Retirees have suffered 12 cuts in monthly pension payments since the outbreak of the crisis, with ministers expected to argue that it is not uncommon for entire families to be forced to rely on pension income. At 41, Tsipras is Greece\u2019s youngest leader in modern times and has proved to be a wily tactician. This was underlined by his ability to turn an overwhelming no to austerity in July\u2019s referendum on EU-dictated measures into a humbling yes barely days later. A lacklustre opposition has also helped him along the way. Unless the centre right opposition party New Democracy ushers in a new era when it undergoes a leadership contest on 10 January, the former communist will remain the dominant figure on the Greek political scene. But Tsipras himself opposes the reforms and the majority of his own MPs are against the measures. In the dissonance that has erupted since his re-election in a snap poll last September, his parliamentary presence has been whittled down to a majority of three. Even if reforms are turned into legislation, there are few who believe they will be implemented or attract the foreign investment that will lead to growth. \u201cI cannot see how this government can survive the reforms. And I cannot see how it can avoid these reforms,\u201d says Aristides Hatzis, an associate professor of law and economics at Athens university. \u201cI think this government will face insurmountable problems in early 2016.\u201d Hatzis worries that Syriza, which was perceived to offer hope last year, will soon come to be identified with despair. And because he believes rage is despair\u2019s mirror image, he wonders where Greeks will turn next. The anti-austerity neo-fascist group Golden Dawn has emerged as a significant political force even if its appeal appears to have peaked. Latest opinion polls have put the once indomitable Syriza at just above 18% \u2013 less than half its ratings six months ago. Analysts agree that Tsipras will try to either consolidate his power by broadening his coalition or once again call elections. \u201cPolitics, since the crisis, is like a meat grinder. It spits politicians out; in a split second, they can find themselves out of favour,\u201d says Hatzis. \u201cMy greatest worry is the political and economic turmoil that will ensue if the government falls.\u201d Capital controls imposed to prevent the country\u2019s financial collapse in July \u2013 bank withdrawals are still limited to \u20ac60 a day or \u20ac420 a week \u2013 are not slated to be lifted until the spring at the earliest. From showing the first signs of recovery in late 2014, the Greek economy is expected to contract again this year. Tax revenues have missed targets and deposit outflows, according to data released by the country\u2019s central bank, have continued apace. But the recapitalisation of banks has gone better than expected and, unlike any of their predecessors, the leftists are better placed to tackle endemic problems such as tax evasion and corruption. After a rollercoaster ride under Yanis Varoufakis, the flamboyant former finance minister, cooperation has replaced confrontation in Athens\u2019 relations with its eurozone partners. The firebrand Tsipras, formerly regarded as the bad boy of EU politics, now says that membership of the common currency is the best possible barrier to economic chaos, a position buttressed by Greece now being on the frontline of Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. That decision, embodied by acceptance of the tough terms attached to the latest bailout deal, appears to have put an end to the tug of war that defines Greek identity as a people caught between east and west on the periphery of Europe. \u201cWe have finally acknowledged that linking ourselves to Europe is the only way to regain lost time,\u201d says Greece\u2019s preeminent philosopher, Stelios Ramfos. \u201cLost time in the form of the centuries forsaken as a people who never experienced the renaissance. If it weren\u2019t for Europe, its rules and directives, Greece would not be much different than Iraq.\u201d This may partly explain why Greece in 2016 will remain the eurozone\u2019s weak link and why, in contrast to other bailed-out EU member states, there is no guarantee that its latest rescue programme will succeed without another bout of debt relief. This will doubtless become a further source of potential conflict with Germany, the biggest contributor of bailout funds to date. Athens\u2019 debt burden is expected to exceed 187% of GDP this year, a load widely viewed as unsustainable if the country is to undergo a sustainable economic recovery. Those given the task of saving Greece are not without blame, according to some observers. \u201cInstead of insisting on full implementation of structural reforms during the programme\u2019s first two critical years, creditors just poured helicopter money into Greece,\u201d says Pelagidis. \u201cAs a result, Europe had decoupled itself from the Greek crisis by the end of 2012, but Greece was still non-reformed, over-indebted and bankrupt.\u201d Greece\u2019s future stability depends on the reaction of Stavros Staikos and other citizens for whom numbers are not abstract, but biting and real. \u201cWhat to say?\u201d he shoots back when asked about the prospect of unrest. \u201cI have a loan of \u20ac45,000, a pension that has been cut to \u20ac700 a month, bills of \u20ac300 a month and a monthly mortgage repayment of \u20ac400 a month. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the future will bring. All I know is I can no longer honour the loan and I will do whatever it takes to protect my family, protect my home.\u201d",

Six years into the country\u2019s morale-sapping debt drama, the omens are mixed.</p> <p>Ushering in the new year, prime minister Alexis Tsipras predicted that 2016 marked the beginning of the end, \u201ca final exit from economic crisis\u201d. With a financial lifeline sealed via an \u20ac86bn (\u00a363bn) aid package from the International Monetary Fund, EU and the European Central Bank, the country could look ahead to radical change and \u201cnational rebirth\u201d.</p> <p>But not everyone is buying into the success story. More than 55% of Greeks signalled pessimism over the future in a recent poll. Another 61% thought their country\u2019s enforced ejection from the eurozone remains a distinct possibility.</p> <p>Alongside the rise in pessimism, the events of the past 12 months have exacerbated Greece\u2019s economic trauma: unemployment has soared above 30% and disposable income has plummeted by more than 25%. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/01/greece_gdp-zip/giv-27167N2OD0oqCExu4/\" data-alt=\"Greek GDP\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/01/greece_gdp-zip/giv-27167N2OD0oqCExu4/\">Greek GDP</a> </figure>  <p>However, after years of make-or-break deadlines and emergency summits, this is a nation that has learned to deal with adversity.

    "webTitle": "Boyfriend of Mike Ashley's daughter gets key Sports Direct role", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boyfriend of Mike Ashley\u2019s eldest daughter could earn about \u00a32.5m a year after being controversially put in charge of Sports Direct\u2019s property empire. Corporate governance watchdogs criticised Sports Direct, the sporting retailer controlled by Ashley, after the retailer revealed that Michael Murray would lead its UK and international property team. Sports Direct said in a stock market statement that Murray would not be paid a salary; instead, the 26-year-old has a \u201cconsultancy arrangement\u201d with the company. However, Murray\u2019s consultancy, MM Prop Consultancy Limited, was only set up on 17 December and is registered to the same address as Ashley\u2019s business interests. The Institute of Directors, the business leaders\u2019 group, said the arrangement would not be tolerated at other companies and warned that shareholders would seek assurances over Murray\u2019s role and qualifications. Murray previously ran student nights in Reading, Berkshire with a friend. The controversy comes after a Guardian investigation revealed that the company effectively pays thousands of temporary workers below the national minimum wage of \u00a36.70 an hour and subjects warehouse staff to a regime of searches and surveillance. Last week, Sports Direct bowed to growing pressure over its employment practices and announced it would increase the pay of thousands of staff on the minimum wage by 15p an hour. Murray\u2019s remuneration is based \u201csolely on creating value\u201d, Sports Direct said. The company\u2019s non-executive directors will oversee an independent review every year to decide with their \u201cabsolute discretion\u201d how much he should be paid. The maximum Murray can be paid is 25% of the increased value. Sports Direct declined to clarify how it would measure the value added, but Murray could earn millions of pounds if it uses the profits it banks from property every year. The company controls \u00a3443m of property, plant and equipment. In its last financial year, Sports Direct earned profits of \u00a310.3m from the buying and selling of property. Under this measure, Murray could collect up to \u00a32.58m in remuneration. He is at risk of being categorised as a de facto or shadow director under existing guidelines, making him subject to the same duties and liabilities as Sports Direct\u2019s board. According to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, a person can be categorised as a de facto director if they are \u201cnegotiating with third parties on behalf of the board\u201d. However, by paying Murray as a consultant and not directly employing him, Sports Direct does not have to make the same financial and regulatory disclosures. Oliver Parry, senior corporate governance adviser at the IoD, said: \u201cAlthough it is ultimately up to each individual company to determine who they appoint to executive roles, shareholders will rightly be concerned about the appointment process surrounding Michael Murray, as well as how he will be remunerated. \u201cAt any other FTSE 100 company, this would not be tolerated. The board should provide more details about how they will assess his \u2018value\u2019 and what his targets will be, which should be high achieving. \u201cConsidering the importance of Mr Murray\u2019s role to Sports Direct\u2019s future, shareholders and other employees deserve to know more about this appointment.\u201d Sarah Wilson, chief executive of Manifest, the shareholder representative group, said related party transactions between directors and their associates were a \u201chot topic\u201d for investors, although Sports Direct is not thought to consider the agreement with Murray as a related party transaction. She said: \u201cAny transfer of wealth from a listed company to a controlling shareholder through related party vehicles have the potential to be detrimental to minority shareholders. Loose or informal governance arrangements have the potential to surprise investors, something they would rather avoid. \u201cInvestors look to high quality disclosures to reassure themselves about the nature and extent of such transactions. We have no doubt that institutional investors will seek assurance and clarity about the nature of the business relationships.\u201d Sports Direct issued the statement after reports that Murray had been appointed as a director to companies connected to Ashley. Murray is a director at Mash Services, a new vehicle linked to Ashley\u2019s main company Mash Holdings, as well as McGrove Developments, Ashley\u2019s new property group, and Strawberry Place Newcastle Limited, which owns land next to Newcastle United\u2019s football stadium and plans to develop offices, student homes and a hotel. Murray is the boyfriend of Anna Ashley, the tycoon\u2019s eldest daughter. Murray bought a property in Belgravia for \u00a310.75m in June 2013 with Ashley lending him money for the deal. In addition, Murray\u2019s former home in Chelsea is now owned by Matilda Ashley, the tycoon\u2019s youngest daughter, who paid \u00a35.1m for the property in September. Sports Direct, which has 400 stores across the country, said the primary task for the property team was to find new sites for its larger format stores and its combined retail and gym units. The retailer is ready to commit \u00a3250m towards buying new sites, particularly in south-east of England, and rolling out the new stores.",

Murray previously ran student nights in Reading, Berkshire with a friend.</p> <p>The controversy comes after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/sports-direct-share-price-falls-following-guardian-working-practices-revelations\">Guardian investigation</a> revealed that the company effectively pays thousands of temporary workers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">below the national minimum wage</a> of \u00a36.70 an hour and subjects warehouse staff to a regime of searches and surveillance. </p> <p>Last week, Sports Direct bowed to growing pressure over its employment practices and announced it would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/31/sports-direct-pledges-10m-towards-staff-pay-rise\">increase the pay of thousands of staff</a> on the minimum wage by 15p an hour. </p> <p>Murray\u2019s remuneration is based \u201csolely on creating value\u201d, Sports Direct said. The company\u2019s non-executive directors will oversee an independent review every year to decide with their \u201cabsolute discretion\u201d how much he should be paid. The maximum Murray can be paid is 25% of the increased value.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/sports-direct-international\">Sports Direct</a> declined to clarify how it would measure the value added, but Murray could earn millions of pounds if it uses the profits it banks from property every year.</p> <p>The company controls \u00a3443m of property, plant and equipment. In its last financial year, Sports Direct earned profits of \u00a310.3m from the buying and selling of property. Under this measure, Murray could collect up to \u00a32.58m in remuneration.</p> <p>He is at risk of being categorised as a de facto or shadow director under existing guidelines, making him subject to the same duties and liabilities as Sports Direct\u2019s board. According to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, a person can be categorised as a de facto director if they are \u201cnegotiating with third parties on behalf of the board\u201d.</p> <p>However, by paying Murray as a consultant and not directly employing him, Sports Direct does not have to make the same financial and regulatory disclosures.</p> <p>Oliver Parry, senior corporate governance adviser at the IoD, said: \u201cAlthough it is ultimately up to each individual company to determine who they appoint to executive roles, shareholders will rightly be concerned about the appointment process surrounding Michael Murray, as well as how he will be remunerated.<br></p> <p>\u201cAt any other FTSE 100 company, this would not be tolerated. The board should provide more details about how they will assess his \u2018value\u2019 and what his targets will be, which should be high achieving.</p> <p>\u201cConsidering the importance of Mr Murray\u2019s role to Sports Direct\u2019s future, shareholders and other employees deserve to know more about this appointment.\u201d </p> <p>Sarah Wilson, chief executive of Manifest, the shareholder representative group, said related party transactions between directors and their associates were a \u201chot topic\u201d for investors, although Sports Direct is not thought to consider the agreement with Murray as a related party transaction.</p> <p>She said: \u201cAny transfer of wealth from a listed company to a controlling shareholder through related party vehicles have the potential to be detrimental to minority shareholders. Loose or informal governance arrangements have the potential to surprise investors, something they would rather avoid.</p> <p>\u201cInvestors look to high quality disclosures to reassure themselves about the nature and extent of such transactions. We have no doubt that institutional investors will seek assurance and clarity about the nature of the business relationships.\u201d</p> <p>Sports Direct issued the statement after reports that Murray had been appointed as a director to companies connected to Ashley. </p> <p>Murray is a director at Mash Services, a new vehicle linked to Ashley\u2019s main company Mash Holdings, as well as McGrove Developments, Ashley\u2019s new property group, and Strawberry Place Newcastle Limited, which owns land next to Newcastle United\u2019s football stadium and plans to develop offices, student homes and a hotel.</p> <p>Murray is the boyfriend of Anna Ashley, the tycoon\u2019s eldest daughter. Murray bought a property in Belgravia for \u00a310.75m in June 2013 with Ashley lending him money for the deal. In addition, Murray\u2019s former home in Chelsea is now owned by Matilda Ashley, the tycoon\u2019s youngest daughter, who paid \u00a35.1m for the property in September.</p> <p>Sports Direct, which has 400 stores across the country, said the primary task for the property team was to find new sites for its larger format stores and its combined retail and gym units. The retailer is ready to commit \u00a3250m towards buying new sites, particularly in south-east of England, and rolling out the new stores.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "So it\u2019s been a not-so-happy new year start on stock markets. Any investors hoping 2016 would bring some fresh market forces will have been spooked by a very familiar pattern today, as weak manufacturing data from China again provided much of the (downward) momentum. Here\u2019s a closing summary of the first trading day of 2016. The FTSE 100 lost 2.4%, its worst opening day to a new year since 2000 and the second-worst on record The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 lost 2.8% and Germany\u2019s Dax lost 4.3%, its weakest start to a trading year in the history of the index On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average has sold off sharply (down 2.4% at the time of the London close) and could end up setting its own multi-decade record: if the losses stay this deep, it will be the worst start to a year since 1932 Brent crude has lost earlier gains made on the back of tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Having rallied more than 4%, it is now down 0.9% at $36.9 per barrel In China, shares were suspended after a drop of 7% activated \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d on their very first day. The Chinese sell-off came as a closely watched survey of the country\u2019s vast manufacturing sector showed it shrank for a tenth month running US manufacturing reports were weaker and construction spending data pointed to a muted finish to 2015 for the world\u2019s biggest economy Manufacturing surveys from the eurozone were more upbeat The latest UK manufacturing PMI showed Britain\u2019s factories grew at a slower pace in December while consumers continued to prop up the recovery with debt-fuelled spending as figures showed the fastest growth in net lending since 2006 The IMF\u2019s new chief economist, Maury Obstfeld, said he was putting China\u2019s transitioning economy high on his watchlist for 2016 Sweden\u2019s central bank moved a step closer to intervening in currency markets to weaken the crown That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and the comments, we will be back early tomorrow with more rolling coverage from global markets. Time for a round-up of European stock markets at the close and on many exchanges it\u2019s clearly been the worst start to the year for many years. The FTSE 100 has lost almost 2.4% on the first day of trading in 2016, that\u2019s a drop of 149 points to 6093. The bluechip index is now at its lowest since 22 December and today marked the biggest one-day drop since a 2.5% fall on 28 September 2015. It is also the second worst opening day on record, says RBS. Here is how markets stand around Europe: France\u2019s CAC 40 down 3% FTSE Eurofirst 300 down 2.8% Germany\u2019s Dax down 4.5% FTSE 100 down 2.4% Those falls follows a plunge in Chinese shares - the worst ever start to a year for the Shanghai Composite index - which saw trading there halted. Over on Wall Street, things are not looking much better and the Dow Jones industrial average is down 2.4% while the S&amp;P 500 is down 2.3%. Just when you thought it might be safe to bet on a rising oil price, Brent crude has turned negative. It had rallied to a session high of $38.99 a barrel earlier on the back of predictions supply could be hit by tensions between Iran and Saudia Arabia. But the price fell back on worries about slower demand after news of a further factory slowdown in China and releases from the US showing its construction and manufacturing sectors had lost steam. Brent crude is currently down 0.9% or 31 cents at $36.97 a barrel. Meanwhile, former Bank of England policymaker David Blanchflower has been scouring the skies for omens.... Sweden\u2019s central bank has come a step closer to intervening in currency markets to weaken the crown, which it worries is keeping inflation from rising back to more normal levels. Against the backdrop of negative interest rates, a quantitative easing programme and a Swedish inflation rate in negative territory at -0.1%, the Riksbank\u2019s governor Stefan Ingves said last week the central bank was ready to start currency interventions to stop the crown from strengthening. Today the bank\u2019s policy-setting board said in a statement it has voted to give the governor the power to intervene immediately in the currency market. The decision at an extraordinary meeting of the six-member board means the central bank will be able to \u201cinstantly intervene on the foreign exchange market if necessary, as a complementary monetary policy measure, to safeguard the rise in inflation\u201d. The statement adds: \u201cSince the last monetary policy meeting in mid-December, the Swedish krona has appreciated against most other currencies. If this development were to continue, it could jeopardise the ongoing upturn in inflation.\u201d The crown weakened against the euro and the dollar after the announcement. With global downturn fears prompting such a rocky start to the new year for global markets, what perfect timing for the IMF\u2019s new economist to share his predictions for 2016. Maury Obstfeld has put China and its slowing economy high on his watchlist for 2016. He also highlights \u201cthe crisis of refugees fleeing Iraq and Syria\u201d, climate change and international trade\u2014 \u201cwhich has had setbacks in recent years\u201d, Obstfeld says, citing the effective end of the Doha trade round. Obstfeld, former chair of the economics department at University of California at Berkeley, joined the International Monetary Fund in September to succeed Olivier Blanchard. Shortly before the start of the new year, IMF Survey magazine interviewed Obstfeld and has just published the chief economist\u2019s views online. Here are some extracts: On key issues to watch in 2016: China will remain high on the list. Its economy is slowing as it transitions from investment and manufacturing to consumption and services. But the global spillovers from China\u2019s reduced rate of growth, through its diminished imports and lower demand for commodities, have been much larger than we would have anticipated. Serious challenges to restructuring remain in terms of state-owned enterprise balance sheet weaknesses, the financial markets, and the general flexibility and rationality of resource allocation. Growth below the authorities\u2019 official targets could again spook global financial markets\u2014but then again, time-honored methods of enforcing growth targets could simply extend economic imbalances, spelling possible trouble down the road. On how 2015 turned out: There was good news and bad news. The U.S. economy continued its solid growth and job creation, while Europe generally picked up speed and Japan remained a question mark. But with some exceptions (such as India), emerging and developing countries continued to slow in the face of falling commodity prices and tighter financial conditions, and synchronized and sustainable global growth remained elusive. The comments follow a prediction from IMF head Christine Lagarde last week that global growth will be disappointing this year as the prospect of rising interest rates in the US and a further slowdown in China feed into uncertainty around the world. Separate date from the US construction sector also strikes a downbeat tone. The Commerce Department said construction spending fell for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years in November. Spending fell 0.4% after a downwardly revised 0.3% rise in October. As Reuters reports, the government revised construction data from January 2005 through October 2015 because of a \u201cprocessing error in the tabulation of data\u201d. The revisions, which showed construction spending was not as strong as previously reported for much of 2015, could prompt economists to lower their fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimates. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.6% in November after a previously reported 1.0% increase in October. Unsurprisingly, this trio of disappointing releases is prompting questions over why the US Federal Reserve thought December was the right time to raise interest rates - the first increase for almost a decade. Meanwhile, US stock markets have sold off further, with the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 2.3% at one point in its biggest one-day fall for more than four months. The Dow Jones is now down 2%, the S&amp;P 500 is down 2.1% and the Nasdaq is down 2.7%. Hot on the heels of that weaker Markit PMI report on US manufacturers comes the separate Institute for Supply Management report and it makes even gloomier reading, suggesting the sector shrank again in December. The main activity index fell to 48.2 in December from 48.6 in November, confounding forecasts for a pick-up to 49.0 in a Reuters poll of economists. As with Markit\u2019s PMI reports, a reading above 50 signals expansion, a reading below suggest contraction. The new orders index in the ISM report edged up to 49.2 from 48.9 in November, but was still below the all-important 50-mark. More details on that weaker Markit U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index: The authors note the latest reading (51.2 in December) was much weaker than the survey average (54.2) and pointed to \u201conly a marginal upturn in operating conditions\u201d. The report also shows output slowed in December and that input costs declined again. On new orders (which expanded at the weakest pace since September 2009), Markit said there was anecdotal evidence of \u201csofter underlying demand conditions, intense competition for new work and subdued business confidence among clients\u201d, while export sales were also close to stagnation in December, with manufacturers noting that the strong dollar continued to act as a drag on demand from abroad. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said: \u201cThe manufacturing sector saw a disappointing end to 2015, and its plight looks set to continue into the New Year as headwinds show no sign of abating any time soon. \u201cOrder book growth has stalled as producers report some of the toughest trading conditions since the end of the global financial crisis. \u201cThe strong dollar is hurting exporters as well as hitting domestic sales as firms compete against inflows of cheap imports. Low oil prices are meanwhile hitting demand for goods and machinery from the energy sector. There are signs that consumers are becoming more cautious in relation to spending as interest rates lift off their historic lows, and overseas demand remains in the doldrums. All of these factors look set to continue to hurt manufacturers, and even intensify, in coming months. \u201cHowever, with the Fed stressing that the trajectory of interest rates will be data dependent, any extended period of weakness at least suggests that the rate hiking process will be very gradual.\u201d The US manufacturing sector grew at a slower pace in December, expanding at the weakest pace for more than three years, according to the latest PMI report from the world\u2019s biggest economy. The survey by data company Markit also pointed to a slowdown in orders, with the weakest reading since during the financial crisis in September 2009. The headline index for manufacturing came in at 51.2 for December, down from an inital estimate of 51.3 and from 52.8 in November. That was above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction but the weakest reading since October 2012. The report follows a flurry of manufacturing surveys from around the world. The picture was particularly weak in China, where the factory sector shrank for a 10th month running. Reports from Europe were slightly brighter with eurozone manufacturing activity picking up in December while in the UK, manufacturing continued to grow but at a slower pace. Ahead of the latest US manufacturing data, American markets have joined in the global rout prompted by weak Chinese figures earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has slumped 350 points or 2% in early trading, while Nasdaq is 2.2% lower and the S&amp;P 500 is off 1.2%. With the FTSE 100 down 2.3%, here are the major movers. With commodity prices falling on renewed fears of a Chinese slowdown, it is no surprise that mining shares are among the biggest fallers. Standard Chartered is also down due to its exposure to emerging markets, and commodity company lending. An exception to the mining slide is Randgold Resources, lifted by a rise in the gold price as investors seek a haven for their cash: Germany\u2019s Dax, now down 4.1%, has seen a broad based fall with the best performers being companies recording, not an increase, but the smallest declines: Danny Blanchflower, former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee: German inflation figures are one positive in a flurry of negative news, according to Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank: With these December data, the year 2015 marks the lowest average annual inflation rate in Germany since the start of the monetary union. Looking at the available components at the regional levels shows that the drop in headline inflation was not only driven by lower energy prices but also some tentative second-round effects on consumer goods and probably first discounts in the Christmas sale season. Looking ahead, it should take at least until the second half of the year before German headline inflation at least crosses the 1%-threshold again. With the continued slump in energy prices, further second-round effects on other goods and only little pricing power from retailers and producer, it is hard to see a strong acceleration of German inflation any time soon. Even the strong labour market and latest wage increases have done little to push up \u2013 at least \u2013 core inflation. All of this means that German consumers are currently enjoying the best of both worlds: a strong labour market with decent wage increases and low inflation. The perfect combination for an improvement of German consumers\u2019 purchasing power and hence private consumption. Looking at other deja-vus at the start of the New Year, like new tensions in the Middle-East, tumbling Chinese stock markets and new problems with structural reforms in Greece, at least German inflation data provide one comforting and positive signal for 2016 today. German inflation figures have come in slightly weaker than expected in December: The harmonised figures have been brought in line with other European countries. Apart from the weak data, there is another reason for the slump in Chinese shares, according to Mark Dampier, head of investment research at Hargreaves Lansdown: Contrary to reports, the fall in the Chinese stock market has little to do with the December PMI data coming in at 49.7 against a consensus of 49.8. It has far more to do with worries that major shareholders will reduce their positions after the ban of share sales and short selling which came in at the end of trading on Friday. The slide in global markets is getting worse. Germany\u2019s Dax, now down 4.3% is heading for its biggest daily fall since August last year following the global market rout in the wake of renewed worries about the Chinese economy. Germany of course is a major exporter and likely to be hard hit by any slowdown. France\u2019s Cac is 2.8% lower while in London, the FTSE 100 has now dropped 162 points or 2.6%, on course for its worst daily performance since September. It looks like the global share sell-off which has followed the weak Chinese data will extend to US markets: Daniel Vernazza, lead UK economist at UniCredit Research, said: With economic growth slowing and consumer credit growth rising fast, the risk to our forecast for the first Bank of England hike to come in May this year is that they delay further and try to use macroprudential policy as the first line of defence against risks to financial stability. The weakness in UK manufacturing activity is explained by a number of headwinds facing UK manufacturers. First, sterling\u2019s past appreciation is still weighing on the competitiveness of UK manufacturers. Second, external demand remains subdued, particularly in emerging markets. Earlier today, Caixin\u2019s China manufacturing PMI surprisingly fell back to 48.2 in December from 48.6 in the prior month; and the new export orders sub-component fell sharply from 51.6 to 47.8, suggesting weak external demand. On the UK manufacturing data, economist Malcolm Barr at JP Morgan said: The December manufacturing PMI release was a modest disappointment, with the headline index nudging down to 51.9 (J.P. Morgan 52.5) from a revised 52.5 in November (previously reported as 52.7). Having stepped down in late 2014 the PMI has been in a range between 51.5 (the survey\u2019s long run average) and 54 for nearly all of 2015. The data increasingly make the move up in activity in to 55.2 in October look like it was a blip. The pound has hit a nine month low against the dollar, as weakness in the economy cast doubt over an imminent UK rate rise and worries grew over the impact of any departure from the European Union. Sterling was down to $1.4684, its lowest since April, and is currently at $1.4795. And here\u2019s a nice graphic showing how China\u2019s CS! 300 suffered major falls last year. And the new year is already on the way to a similar performance. The grim start to the new year means some \u00a334bn has been wiped off the value of Britain\u2019s top one hundred companies with the FTSE 100 down 133 points. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said: Anyone hitting the trading floor expecting a calm and quiet start to 2016 was given a rude surprise as Asian chaos affected European markets. Worries over China\u2019s ability to keep up its pace of economic growth have been hit with an early warning sign as the Caixin PMI data came in weaker than expected, and stretched the contraction in China to ten months. This swift return to the 2015 template of worrying about China looks to have been the trigger for the selloff in Chinese equities. It is the first time Chinese regulators have activated the suspension in trading as a circuit breaker safety measure. Starting the year off by suspending trading an hour and a half early on the back of a 7% fall has set an ugly precedent for the year ahead. Tensions in the Middle East have escalated again as the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran is being stretched to breaking point. Considering the prominence both nations take as far as global oil supply is concerned, the subsequent spike in oil prices is, if anything, a little on the mild side. An interest rate rise is still on the cards this year, even though the manufacturing sector has come in weaker than expected, according to ING Bank. However any increase in borrowing costs may now come later than forecasters currently believe, said ING\u2019s James Smith: The UK manufacturing PMI fell unexpectedly to 51.9 in December, from 52.7 previously (consensus 52.8), consistent with levels seen through most of 2015 before the surprise uplift in October. This marks a disappointing end for what was a difficult year for the manufacturing sector given external growth concerns and sterling strength. Looking at the details, Markit said that input prices continued to fall sharply in December, which they attribute to lower commodity prices (principally oil). Furthermore, export orders continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace. All in all, this suggests that the manufacturing sector contributed very little to fourth quarter GDP growth (released at the end of this month), although it is worth noting that manufacturing only forms around 10% of the UK economy (versus 30% in the late 1970s). The service sector, which makes up over three quarters, is performing better and we should get a further indication of this on Wednesday when the services PMI is released. Overall, the economy remains strong and the case for a rate hike in 2016 looks very compelling. Although we continue to forecast a hike in the second quarter, the risks surrounding the EU referendum are beginning to build and the probability that the Bank of England will leave rates lower for a longer period of time is increasing. Despite the disappointing UK manufacturing figures, Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said there could be a pickup in GDP growth in the fourth quarter: Despite December\u2019s dip, the purchasing managers\u2019 survey does show overall improvement in the fourth quarter of 2015; and it does look possible that the manufacturing sector managed to eke out a modicum of growth in the fourth quarter after contracting in both the third (by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter) and second quarters (by 0.6%). In fact the manufacturing PMI averaged 53.3 in the fourth quarter, which was markedly above the third quarter average of 51.8 and clearly above the 50.0 level indicates flat activity. Meanwhile, although latest hard data show that manufacturing output dipped 0.4% month-on-month in October this followed increases in both September (0.9%) and August (0.3%) so it was actually up 0.4% on a three-month/three-month basis. If the manufacturing sector did manage to eke out some growth in the fourth quarter, it would boost the chances that the economy managed to achieve some pick-up in GDP growth after it dipped to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. We have pencilled in GDP growth of 0.6% quarter-on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2015. Even if the manufacturing sector did manage to eke out some growth in the fourth quarter, 2015 was undoubtedly a torrid year for manufacturers. Furthermore, the pretty lacklustre December PMI suggest that 2016 is also likely to be challenging for manufacturers. Indeed, the breakdown of the December purchasing managers\u2019 survey shows new orders growth matching July\u2019s lowest level for 2015, with export orders only inching up. Furthermore, backlogs of work contracted markedly. Meanwhile, more signs of a buoyant UK housing market and confident consumers, with higher than expected lending figures. Reuters reports: British lending to consumers expanded at the fastest annual rate in almost a decade in November and banks approved more mortgages than forecast, showing a buoyant mood among households towards the end of 2015. The Bank of England said net lending to consumers in November was up 8.3 percent compared with a year earlier, the biggest such increase since February 2006 and a growth rate that may raise concern at the Bank about lending standards. Lenders also granted more home loans than expected, with 70,410 mortgages for house purchase approved, the highest number in three months. The figures add to signs that Britain\u2019s housing market is accelerating after a dip in mid-2014 when tighter rules on mortgage lending took effect, requiring banks and building societies to make more rigorous checks on whether borrowers can afford their loans. Here are the key charts for the disappointing UK manufacturing data: The manufacturing data is more bad news for chancellor George Osborne, and his chances of hitting his Autumn Statement targets. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit said: The UK manufacturing sector ended 2015 on a disappointing note, with its rate of growth slowing further from October\u2019s recent high back down towards the stagnation mark. This suggests that industry will make, at best, only a marginal positive contribution to broader economic growth in the final quarter of the year. Although this would be an improvement on the second and third quarters, it does also suggest that manufacturing output over 2015 as a whole may be below the level achieved in 2014. With the latest revisions to official data also suggesting that GDP growth earlier in the year was softer than previously thought, the emphasis has really shifted to other sectors of the economy if the rate of expansion for the year as a whole is to come in close to the OBR forecast as outlined in the Autumn Statement. And after the positive eurozone figures, the UK purchasing managers\u2019 index has come in below expectations, recording its slowest growth in three months. The index fell from 52.5 in November to 51.9 last month, below expectations of a figure of 52.7. New orders came in at their slowest pace for five years, according to the Markit survey. Here\u2019s our story on the rising oil price: Economist Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: The improved Eurozone manufacturing survey for December supports hopes that Eurozone growth picked up to at least 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the in the fourth quarter of 2014 after dipping to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter from 0.4% in the second and a peak of 0.5% in the first quarter. Eurozone manufacturers are currently getting appreciable help from very low oil and commodity prices which is boosting their ability to price competitively to win business. In addition, a weak euro is boosting Eurozone manufacturers\u2019 competitiveness in international markets \u2013 so they will be hoping that the euro does not rise any further after firming to be currently trade close to $1.09 from a seven-month low of $1.055 earlier in December. Meanwhile, the fundamentals look reasonably solid for consumer spending in the eurozone which should be supportive to demand for durable manufactured goods. Consumers\u2019 purchasing power is getting a serious boost from very low inflation/deflation across all countries while labour markets have generally improved. Indeed, it is notable that the European Commission reported that consumers\u2019 perception of whether it is a good time to make major purchases now and during the next 12 months in November were only just below September\u2019s respective strongest levels since September 2001 and February 2008. Nevertheless, there are still appreciable challenges facing Eurozone manufacturers. Foreign orders are being hampered by mediocre global growth, most notably the slowdown in China and emerging markets. Eurozone manufacturers will also be wary that the current uncertain global growth outlook could lead to increased business caution over investment and the purchase of capital goods. Commenting on the eurozone PMI figure, Markit said: The eurozone manufacturing sector continued to make solid progress at the end of 2015, as rates of growth in production, new orders and new export business all improved. Although input costs and output charges fell again, trends in both provided further evidence of deflationary pressures easing. With the Greek PMI edging back above 50.0, December saw PMI readings in all of the nations covered at levels signalling expansion for the first time since April 2014. Italy remained the fastest- growing, with its rate of expansion improving to a 57- month record. \uf0a7 So the overall picture for eurozone manufacturing has shown an improvement. The purchasing managers\u2019 index for the eurozone came in at 53.2 in December, according to Markit. This compares to the 53.1 initial estimate, and the 52.8 recorded in November. And Greek manufacturing has also shown an improvement: Markit said: Greek manufacturers reported a slight improvement in operating conditions in December, ending a sequence of deterioration which began in September 2014. The upturn in manufacturing was driven by higher production, which returned to expansionary territory for the first time in 12 months. Encouragingly, a slight increase in staff numbers was also reported. The German manufacturing sector has recorded its best performance for four months, according to the PMI survey. The Markit index rose from 52.9 in November to 53.2 last month, and economist Oliver Kolodseike said: Reflective of the trend observed throughout 2015, the Germany Manufacturing PMI posted above the no- change mark of 50.0 in December, thereby signalling sustained growth in the sector. New order intakes continued to grow at a healthy rate, with demand for consumer goods particularly strong and exports showing the largest monthly rise since February 2014. However, the strong rise in new business resulted in capacity problems at some plants, with business outstanding rising at the sharpest rate for nearly two years. It is therefore likely that employment and output will continue to increase in coming months. Downward pressure on inflation meanwhile persisted at the year end, as the recent falls in energy and oil prices led to a further sharp drop in manufacturers\u2019 input costs. Meanwhile in France the purchasing managers\u2019 index hit a 21 month high, according to Markit. The index climbed to 51.4 in December from 50.6 the previous month, its highest level since March 2014. A strong performance in December meant Italy\u2019s manufacturing sector ended 2015 by growing at the fastest rate since early 2011. The Markit PMI index came in at 55.6 in December, up from 54.9 the previous month and the best reading since March 2011. There was a sharp and accelerated increase in production levels at manufacturers. Markit economist Phil Smith said: The headline PMI maintained its recent ascent in December, moving to its highest level since March 2011. This completes what is a drastic turnaround from the situation just one year ago when the index was languishing below the 50.0 mark as the economy contracted. Since then, a weak euro, recovering domestic demand and falling global commodity prices have provided the necessary tailwinds to get things moving. The goods-producing sector has solid momentum heading into the New Year, with new order growth accelerating and companies taking on new staff to cope with rising production requirements. The weak Chinese data has, inevitably, hit metal prices on concerns about a slowdown in demand. And that in turn has meant shares in mining companies are among the day\u2019s biggest fallers so far, with Anglo American down 5%, Glencore 4% lower and Antofagasta off 3%. Spanish manufacturing activity was virtually unchanged in December, but both output and new orders rose at sharper rates than in November. The Markit purchasing managers\u2019 index came in at 53 last month, down from 53.1 in November and slightly below forecasts. Markit senior economist Andrew Harker said: The latest Spanish manufacturing PMI data signalled a solid end to 2015 for the sector as growth rates for output and new orders continued to accelerate following a brief slowdown around the end of the third quarter. The rate of job creation remained weak, however, with companies perhaps cautious about making decisions on hiring and investment ahead of the election on December 20 (the data were all collected prior to the election) and subsequent results. With the FTSE 100 now down around 2%, market analyst Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct said: It might be a new year as far as the calendar is concerned, but the market seems unwilling to be taking a fresh view. Disappointing manufacturing data out of China overnight resulted in such a marked fall for domestic stocks that trading was suspended in Shanghai for the remainder of the session, so there can be no surprise that many of the mining stocks in London have once again been left wearing more than their fair share of losses in early trade in what is by all accounts a sea of red numbers. One notable exception here is Randgold Resources \u2013 the equity slump in China is driving gold prices sharply higher, leaving the stock as the only winner a few minutes into the day. A degree of volatility was probably to be expected this morning as normal trading conditions resume, but it appears that the big sell-off is being driven largely by the overnight news out of Asia, rather than any New Year\u2019s hangover of the so-called Santa rally we saw start less than two weeks ago. With further tensions in the Middle East, notably between Saudi Arabia and Iran after the execution of the Saudi Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, crude prices have edged higher. Brent crude is currently up 0.7% at $37.57 a barrel, and would probably have been higher if not for the weak Chinese data. In the wake of the Chinese data disappointment, European markets have opened sharply lower. The FTSE 100 has fallen 87 points or 1.4%, while Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 2.8% and France\u2019s Cac is down 1.2% and Spain\u2019s Ibex has lost 1.3%. But bear in mind that while the FTSE 100 lost 4.9% in 2015, both the Dax and the Cac moved higher, up 9.8% and 8.5% respectively, putting these latest moves in context. More on Chinese manufacturing: Ahead of the UK PMI figures, here\u2019s a preview from Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 survey (out on Monday) is likely to show modest overall expansion in December, although it is unclear to what extent activity may have been affected by the flooding. Specifically, we expect the manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) to have edged back further to 52.5 in December after dipping to 52.7 in November from 55.2 in October (which had been the best performance since June 2014 and a sharp improvement from 51.7 in September). Even so, this would result in the PMI averaging 53.5 in the fourth quarter, which would be markedly above the third quarter average of 51.8 and clearly above the 50.0 level indicates flat activity. UK mortgage approvals and consumer credit figures are also due to be released. The weak Chinese data and the subsequent plunge on the country\u2019s stock markets is likely to have a negative impact on European shares: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a good day for data junkies, with snapshots of December\u2019s manufacturing figures from the UK, US and Europe. But as traders return to their desks for the first full week after the festive period, things have got off to a bad start. After weak manufacturing figures last week from China, a private survey on Monday showed factory activity contracting for the tenth month in a row. The Caixin/Markit PMI fell to 48.2 in December, down from November\u2019s reading of 48.6 and below expectations of a figure of 49. Anything below 50 signals contraction. The disappointment led to weakness in the yuan, and prompted a 7% fall in the blue chip CSI300 index, before circuit breakers kicked in to halt stock market trading. This was the first time they had been used to curb market volatility. The poor manufacturing data could well lead Chinese authorities to bring in further stimulus measures to help boost the flagging economy. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: China\u2019s latest PMI data implies more stimulus may be required in 2016. The surprise monthly drop in the Caixin report comes off the back of the official manufacturing PMI that saw factory activity shrink for the fifth month in December with a reading of 49.7, up slightly from November. A big swing factor for this coming year will be whether Beijing makes better use of its ability to stabilise the Chinese economy. The government has been walking a tightrope of growth stabilisation and economic reform. The way Chinese authorities lean in 2016 could determine whether market\u2019s have a good year or not.

Its economy is slowing as it transitions from investment and manufacturing to consumption and services. But the global spillovers from China\u2019s reduced rate of growth, through its diminished imports and lower demand for commodities, have been much larger than we would have anticipated. Serious challenges to restructuring remain in terms of state-owned enterprise balance sheet weaknesses, the financial markets, and the general flexibility and rationality of resource allocation. Growth below the authorities\u2019 official targets could again spook global financial markets\u2014but then again, time-honored methods of enforcing growth targets could simply extend economic imbalances, spelling possible trouble down the road. </p> </blockquote> <p>On how 2015 turned out:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was good news and bad news. The U.S. economy continued its solid growth and job creation, while Europe generally picked up speed and Japan remained a question mark. But with some exceptions (such as India), emerging and developing countries continued to slow in the face of falling commodity prices and tighter financial conditions, and synchronized and sustainable global growth remained elusive.</p> </blockquote> <p>The comments follow a prediction from IMF head Christine Lagarde last week that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/30/imf-chief-christine-lagarde-disappointing-global-growth-economy-2016\">global growth will be disappointing this year</a> as the prospect of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/16/federal-reserve-us-interest-rate-rise-fed-funds-janet-yellen\">rising interest rates in the US</a> and a further <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/19/slowing-growth-china-commodities-global-economy\">slowdown in China</a> feed into uncertainty around the world.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568a8d2ce4b03b24c8fe0ee2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-04T15:28:57.672Z\">3.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Separate date from the <strong>US construction sector</strong> also strikes a downbeat tone.</p> <p>The Commerce Department said construction spending fell for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years in November.

The perfect combination for an improvement of German consumers\u2019 purchasing power and hence private consumption. Looking at other deja-vus at the start of the New Year, like new tensions in the Middle-East, tumbling Chinese stock markets and new problems with structural reforms in Greece, at least German inflation data provide one comforting and positive signal for 2016 today.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568a6db0e4b08cff944021fd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-04T13:05:26.915Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">German inflation slows in December</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>German inflation figures have come in slightly weaker than expected in December:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/livesquawk/statuses/683996450133508096\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"pt\" dir=\"ltr\">German CPI EU Harmonized (MoM) Dec P: 0.00% (est 0.20%; prev 0.10%)&#10;-CPI EU Harmonized (YoY) Dec P: 0.20% (est 0.40%; prev 0.30%)</p>&mdash; Live Squawk (@livesquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/livesquawk/status/683996450133508096\">January 4, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The harmonised figures have been brought in line with other European countries.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-01-04T13:11:09.404Z\">at 1.11pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-568a63e6e4b08cff94401e17\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-04T12:23:22.463Z\">12.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Apart from the weak data, there is another reason for the slump in Chinese shares, according to Mark Dampier, head of investment research at Hargreaves Lansdown:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Contrary to reports, the fall in the Chinese stock market has little to do with the December PMI data coming in at 49.7 against a consensus of 49.8.

This marks a disappointing end for what was a difficult year for the manufacturing sector given external growth concerns and sterling strength. Looking at the details, Markit said that input prices continued to fall sharply in December, which they attribute to lower commodity prices (principally oil). Furthermore, export orders continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace.</p> <p>All in all, this suggests that the manufacturing sector contributed very little to fourth quarter GDP growth (released at the end of this month), although it is worth noting that manufacturing only forms around 10% of the UK economy (versus 30% in the late 1970s). The service sector, which makes up over three quarters, is performing better and we should get a further indication of this on Wednesday when the services PMI is released.</p> <p>Overall, the economy remains strong and the case for a rate hike in 2016 looks very compelling. Although we continue to forecast a hike in the second quarter, the risks surrounding the EU referendum are beginning to build and the probability that the Bank of England will leave rates lower for a longer period of time is increasing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-568a40cde4b03051a013845e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-04T09:54:53.793Z\">9.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Despite the disappointing UK manufacturing figures, Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said there could be a pickup in GDP growth in the fourth quarter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite December\u2019s dip, the purchasing managers\u2019 survey does show overall improvement in the fourth quarter of 2015; and it does look possible that the manufacturing sector managed to eke out a modicum of growth in the fourth quarter after contracting in both the third (by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter) and second quarters (by 0.6%). In fact the manufacturing PMI averaged 53.3 in the fourth quarter, which was markedly above the third quarter average of 51.8 and clearly above the 50.0 level indicates flat activity. Meanwhile, although latest hard data show that manufacturing output dipped 0.4% month-on-month in October this followed increases in both September (0.9%) and August (0.3%) so it was actually up 0.4% on a three-month/three-month basis.</p> <p>If the manufacturing sector did manage to eke out some growth in the fourth quarter, it would boost the chances that the economy managed to achieve some pick-up in GDP growth after it dipped to 0.4% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. We have pencilled in GDP growth of 0.6% quarter-on quarter in the fourth quarter of 2015. </p> <p>Even if the manufacturing sector did manage to eke out some growth in the fourth quarter, 2015 was undoubtedly a torrid year for manufacturers. </p> <p>Furthermore, the pretty lacklustre December PMI suggest that 2016 is also likely to be challenging for manufacturers. Indeed, the breakdown of the December purchasing managers\u2019 survey shows new orders growth matching July\u2019s lowest level for 2015, with export orders only inching up.

Meanwhile, the fundamentals look reasonably solid for consumer spending in the eurozone which should be supportive to demand for durable manufactured goods. Consumers\u2019 purchasing power is getting a serious boost from very low inflation/deflation across all countries while labour markets have generally improved. Indeed, it is notable that the European Commission reported that consumers\u2019 perception of whether it is a good time to make major purchases now and during the next 12 months in November were only just below September\u2019s respective strongest levels since September 2001 and February 2008.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there are still appreciable challenges facing Eurozone manufacturers.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the Treasury\u2019s most senior civil servant, will step down in April after 10 years advising successive chancellors of the exchequer. The surprise announcement will trigger a search for a new permanent secretary, most likely from the ranks of the Treasury\u2019s senior staff, although the No 10 adviser Tom Scholar was cited by some insiders as a possible successor. Macpherson, 56, who joined the Treasury in 1985, has held various roles including principal private secretary to Kenneth Clarke, the former Tory chancellor, and then to Labour\u2019s long-running chancellor, Gordon Brown during the banking crisis. He came to prominence last year during the Scottish independence referendum when he advised the chancellor, George Osborne, against entering into a currency union with Edinburgh. His intervention was widely seen as crucial in scuppering the hopes of Scottish Nationalists that an independent Scotland could maintain sterling as its currency.

The sportswear retailer says Murray heads its UK and international property team, whose main job is to find sites for large stores and a new format combining a shop and a gym.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Oil prices swung rapidly on Monday, first rising on tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran before fears about the strength of the global economy drove prices lower. Brent crude oil futures rose 3.3% to $38.50 (\u00a326.17) a barrel at one stage, the global benchmark\u2019s highest price for about three weeks, after Saudi Arabia executed a prominent Shia Muslim cleric. However, the weak economic data coming out of China triggered fears about a downturn in economic growth, and sentiment about the world economy was knocked further by figures coming out of the US. By the end of the day in London, Brent was down 13 cents at $37.14. Late last month, the price hit its lowest level for 11 years, touching $36.05 a barrel. Then the concern was about the impact on supply from the lifting of sanctions on Iran which could push down prices further. The tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran was also sparking questions about the implications for oil production. Some analysts were suggesting the Iranians might export more oil once sanctions are lifted, adding to the world\u2019s oversupply of the commodity. But, others said Saudi output in its eastern province could be jeopardised by unrest in the region, which could knock its output. Ric Spooner, an analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, said there was no imminent threat to oil production but that the dispute was a cause for concern. \u201cIt may be seen by the market as an incremental step in a possible longer-term escalation of problems in the core oil producing nations of Saudi Arabia and Iran,\u201d he told Bloomberg News. Saudi Arabia cut diplomatic ties with Iran after protesters attacked its embassy in Tehran on Saturday, setting fire to the building. The onslaught was triggered by the execution of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a critic of the Saudi monarchy. He was killed with 46 others accused of terrorist offences. The Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said Shia-ruled Iran\u2019s diplomatic staff in Saudi Arabia had been given 48 hours to leave the Sunni-led kingdom. The dispute is the worst crisis between the regional powers, led by competing sects of Islam, since the 1980s. Saudi Arabia and Iran are the most powerful members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and are battling for regional influence. Analysts have said the removal of western sanctions against Iran will add to global oil reserves. Last month, Opec decided to stick with its policy of not constraining output. Key members of the cartel \u2013 effectively led by Saudi Arabia \u2013 have kept the pumps on overdrive in an effort to maintain market share and pressure high-cost producers in other parts of the world. Some say the strategy has been formulated with a view to wrecking the shale gas industry in the US, which has gone a long way to providing energy independence to the region. The Opec meeting last month highlighted the growing discord between Riyadh and Tehran. Iran has called for action to stem the drop in oil prices but its requests have been rebuffed by the kingdom, which is the world\u2019s largest oil exporter. The political tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran will result in oil prices becoming more unpredictable, which will likely affect other asset classes, including bonds, said Sharon Stark, chief fixed income strategist at DA Davidson &amp; Co in Florida. Oil initially rose despite weak manufacturing data from China that caused shares across the world to fall. The severe fall in the price of oil over the past year claimed another casualty on the first working day of the new year as Swift Energy, an independent oil and gas group with operations in Louisiana and Texas in the US (and more than $1.2m of debt), filed for bankruptcy.",

      "bodyText": "Sending a letter within Australia is now slower and more expensive. Australia Post has increased the cost of stamps for sending regular letters within the country from 70 cents to $1 \u2013 a rise of nearly 43%. The change to the \u201cBasic Postage Rate\u201d, effective on Monday, comes with the introduction of three delivery speeds for sending letters within Australia: express post, priority and regular. The regular service is now slower by up to two business days. A letter could take as many as six business days to arrive at its destination. The new priority service is up to two days faster, with an estimated delivery time of between one and four days \u2013 but costs an extra 50 cents for a priority label. Express Post remains the fastest service, with \u201cguaranteed next-business-day delivery*\u201d \u2013 to approximately 80% of Australian addresses, as part of its network operating \u201cbetween all capital cities (except Darwin and in Perth CBD only) and some major centres\u201d. In an explanatory video posted on YouTube, Australia Post says the changes are designed to give consumers \u201cmore choice over the speed at which you send letters\u201d. Almost-instantaneous delivery of correspondence of any size, to any destination, is not being offered by the postal service. Concession card holders can continue to buy regular stamps for 60 cents; the priority service will cost them $1.10. The price of seasonal greeting stamps remains unchanged. The increases were expected after Australia Post recorded an annual after-tax loss of $222m in late September \u2013 its first loss in 30 years \u2013 that group CEO Ahmed Fahour said reflected \u201cterminal and structural decline\u201d in the sending of letters. Australia Post signalled its intention to increase stamp prices at the time, but first had to secure the approval of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The government granted it regulatory approval to introduce different speeds of service. Fahour has not commented on the change to services on Twitter, although he had posted on the site on Sunday. Unusually for the forum, there were no cries of outrage expressed on Twitter over the price increases, but they were discussed with some bitterness on Australia Post\u2019s \u201cNational Conservation\u201d forum. User \u201cJodiandbrett\u201d said all services bar regular were now \u201cexpensive\u201d and \u201cunaffordable\u201d. \u201cMy goodness. I really feel helpless here, does giving my opinion actually make a difference or is it just a place Australia Post have put here for people to \u2018feel\u2019 like they can voice their opinions? ... Thank you for letting me vent, as I am sure that\u2019s all this will be good for.\u201d User \u201cDanny\u201d compared the introduction of the priority label to the pink sticker service offered \u201cback in the 1990s\u201d. In response, user \u201cRubblesby\u201d said Fahour \u201cshould be sacked\u201d. \u201cHe took what was once a proud Australian institution that people loved and trusted and turned it into a self serving honey pot\u201d. No dollar stamps were available for sale in Australia Post\u2019s online store today, and priority stamps were out of stock.",

      "bodyText": "Worries about the eurozone and shaky prospects for the wider global economy have dented confidence among bosses of the UK\u2019s biggest companies, according to a survey. After a tumultuous 2015, when a downturn in China and sharp slowdown in global trade prompted big businesses to scale back spending plans, the year ahead will be marked by even more caution, a poll of chief financial officers (CFOs) suggests. The survey by consultancy Deloitte also signals growing uncertainty among business leaders over the UK\u2019s planned referendum on EU membership, with support for staying in the bloc waning significantly over the past six months. The quarterly report chimes with economists\u2019 warnings over a range of risks to the global economic recovery in 2016. It follows a prediction from IMF head Christine Lagarde last week that global growth will be disappointing this year as the prospect of rising interest rates in the US and a further slowdown in China feed into uncertainty around the world. Confidence back to 2012 levels Business confidence fell for the third quarter running in the Deloitte survey and is now back to where is was in early 2012 when the eurozone was in recession. Almost a third of the 137 CFOs surveyed, or 30%, said they were less optimistic about the prospects for their companies compared with three months ago. That was up from 20% feeling more downbeat when asked six months earlier. Just 12% said they were more optimistic in the latest poll, down from 36% six months earlier. As a result, risk appetite was also down and the pace of hiring and capital spending was likely to slow in coming months, said Deloitte\u2019s chief economist Ian Stewart. \u201cDoubts about the pace and sustainability of the global recovery are weighing on business sentiment,\u201d Stewart added. \u201cUK corporate sector risk appetite has fallen to a three-and-a-half-year low, mirroring the loss aversion and caution being seen in financial markets... CFOs\u2019 strategies are more defensive than at any time in the past three years.\u201d Growth prospects Finance chiefs were broadly optimistic about the UK\u2019s economic prospects in 2016 as well as for the US, the world\u2019s largest economy. But despite stronger than expected growth in the euro area last year, CFOs remained pessimistic about prospects for the region. Levels of confidence about growth in the single currency bloc were lower than for emerging market economies. The survey also signalled a drop in support among business leaders for the UK to remain in the EU ahead of a referendum on the issue, expected this year and promised before the end of 2017 by prime minister David Cameron. Shifting views on EU membership Deloitte asked CFOs whether it was in the interests of British business for the UK to remain a member of the EU. In the latest survey, 62% agreed that continued membership was beneficial, down from 74% when the question was asked six months earlier. There was also an increase in the number of those saying that UK business would benefit from leaving, to 6% now compared with just 2% before. Just over a quarter, or 28%, said their decision depended on the outcome of the prime minister\u2019s renegotiation of UK membership, up from 23% six months earlier. The remaining 4% said they were uncertain of their position. The narrowing support among CFOs for staying in the EU follows polls finding British voters split down the middle on EU membership. \u201cA clear majority of CFOs continue to favour the UK remaining in the EU, but the proportion of those expressing unqualified support has fallen. This mirrors what we have seen from the broader public in opinion polls in the last six months,\u201d said David Sproul, senior partner and chief executive of Deloitte. \u201cWith around one third of CFOs undecided on their position or awaiting the outcome of renegotiation discussions, the eventual deal may well significantly affect business attitudes to EU membership.\u201d After almost seven years of interest rates being held at a record low of 0,5%, a potential increase from Bank of England policymakers in coming months represents yet another uncertainty for businesses as they enter 2016. With low oil prices helping to keep inflation low, financial markets do not point to a rate rise until late 2016 or early 2017. But a recent Reuters poll found that most economists expect a move sooner. Deloitte said its survey suggested that big companies felt they were well positioned to cope with higher borrowing costs. Almost two thirds, or 64%, said interest rates would have to rise by one percentage point before their businesses cut planned investments or employment. One in ten said a rate rise would be good for their business. There is similar evidence of falling confidence in a separate survey of 1,500 UK companies by Lloyds Bank out today. It found that businesses were less confident about prospects for the next six months, with UK and global demand seen as the biggest threats to their fortunes in 2016. Expectations of an interest rate rise in 2016 had increased among the predominantly small to medium-sized businesses surveyed by Lloyds.",
