      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce has become the latest major UK company to warn on profits as the industrial group called an end to a decade of revenue growth and wiped more than \u00a33bn off its share price. The Derby-based engine manufacturer joined Pearson, BG Group and Royal Bank of Scotland in surprising investors this year with an about-turn on earnings, predicting profits would be flat in 2014 owing to US defence cuts and the end of profitable contracts. Rolls-Royce stock slumped 13.6%, costing shareholders \u00a33.1bn, but the company was only the second-biggest faller in the FTSE 100 index behind sweetener firm Tate &amp; Lyle, which issued a profit warning and slipped 16%. They joined a string of companies that have jolted investors with grim trading updates this year even as the economy shows signs of improvement, with the strength of sterling among the most commonly cited factors for downward revisions to earnings. Announcing a \"pause\" in growth after a strong 2013, chief executive John Rishton said: \"This is a break in a 10-year trend that will be followed by more growth in 2015. We have defied gravity for a couple of years compared with other defence companies and the impact of a couple of things is coming together in 2014.\" The world's second-biggest aircraft engine maker expects revenue to fall between 15% and 20% at its defence business and a small reduction in revenue but modest profit growth at its marine division. The defence arm will feel the effects of \"well publicised cuts\" in the US and the end of big orders in India and the Middle East, Rishton said. But Investors were left shocked by the grim trading update from a company that is normally a model for meeting market expectations. Tina Wood, an industry analyst at broker Charles Stanley, said: \"For the past few years Rolls-Royce's defence business has been outperforming its defence peers. Analysts have been asking about that for the last two years so it's quite a shock for it to be downgraded so much. It's raised a lot of questions and that is clearly reflected in what has happened to the share price, which is dramatic, especially for a company such as Rolls-Royce.\" Rishton said: \"Could we have done better? Yes we probably could. You reflect on it and you think maybe we need to do something different and that's what we have done.\" Rolls-Royce's underlying pre-tax profit for 2013, excluding an acquisition, rose 23% to \u00a31.76bn \u2013 near the top of analyst forecasts. Rishton said a record order book of \u00a371.6bn \u2013 up 19% \u2013 underpinned the group's prospects for many years to come and that a flat 2014 would be \"a pause, not a change in direction\". He said confidence on growth allowed Rolls-Royce to increase its annual dividend by 13% to 22p. Rishton declined to comment on two arrests made by the Serious Fraud Office on Wednesday in connection with an investigation into allegations of bribery in Indonesia and China. Neither of those arrested was a Rolls-Royce employee but were said to have been intermediaries used by the company. \"It's a matter for the authorities,\" Rishton said. Rolls-Royce and Tate &amp; Lyle, whose sucralose product is suffering from heavy competition in China, are the latest big UK firms to warn on trading this year. Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group and Pearson have all shaken investors with profit alerts along with Royal Bank of Scotland and retailers Morrisons and Mothercare. They were joined on Thursday by Swiss firms Nestl\u00e9, the world's biggest food company, and ABB, an engineering group, which warned of a sharp worsening of revenue prospects. Financial analyst Louise Cooper said Britain might be growing strongly but the world economy was still suffering from the after-effects of the financial crisis and the global recession that followed. \"Tate &amp; Lyle is a one-off and it doesn't tell us much about the world. What is more concerning is when companies are worrying about the top line, and to have three big companies warning about revenue today is a little concerning. Nestl\u00e9's chief executive calls Europe a no-growth environment with material negative pricing. That is quite worrying for something as basic as food from such a big company.\" Upside downside Rolls-Royce and Tate &amp; Lyle have joined a growing list of companies that have stunned investors with grim updates on their trading prospects this year. The aerospace giant said a decade of growth would end this year as US spending cuts hit its defence division. Tate &amp; Lyle was hit by falling fizzy drink sales and price pressure from a glut of unsold Chinese sucralose.Profit warnings have come thick and fast in the first few weeks of 2014 even as Britain and the US have shown encouraging signs of economic growth and the eurozone has shaken off its long recession. They also follow a year in which warnings fell to a three-year low, according to figures from accountants EY. But the recent trend was already taking shape at the end of last year. British companies published 73 profit warnings in the final three months of 2013, up 30% on the previous quarter. The 350 biggest listed companies posted 31 warnings \u2013 as many as in the last quarter of 2008 when the world was on the brink of financial armageddon.Thursday brought three significant profit warnings that do not bode well for wider market prospects \u2013 two of them outside the UK. Alongside Rolls-Royce's revelation, Switzerland's Nestle, the world's biggest food company, and ABB, the automation giant, also issued grim outlooks on revenues. Financial analyst Louise Cooper said: \"Tate &amp; Lyle is a one-off and it doesn't tell us much about the world. What is more concerning is when companies are worrying about the top line, and to have three big companies warning about revenue today is a little concerning.\" \"Nestle's chief executive calls Europe a no-growth environment with material negative pricing. That is quite worrying for something as basic as food from such a big company.\" There is no dominant pattern in the roster of UK companies warning on profits. A number of warnings, for example that relating to BG Group's problems in Egypt and the fallout from the scandal of Serco overcharging taxpayers, were specific to those companies. But many of the warnings indicate a global economy still suffering from the after-effects of the financial crash and the deep recession that followed \u2013 from government cutbacks to tumbling emerging market currencies and weak household spending power. The main retail casualties \u2013 Morrisons, Mothercare and Debenhams on New Year's Eve \u2013 suffered from their own shortcomings such as poor internet strategies compared with online converts such as Next and Argos. But the trio all suffered from cut-throat competition as squeezed UK consumers abandoned the middle ground and opted for cheaper options with a touch of luxury on top. Companies have become more global meaning shocks outside Britain economy \u2013 such as political unrest in the Middle East, turmoil in emerging markets and falling commodity prices \u2013 are more likely to affect UK firms. The FTSE 100 is no longer a barometer for the UK economy. Britain's leading companies now make almost 80% of their revenues overseas and 30% from emerging markets after they expanded overseas or foreign companies listed in London. For companies trading abroad, and particularly in emerging markets, the strengthening US and British economies are not necessarily a good thing. The falls in developing countries' currencies hit profits when they are translated into the buoyant pound or, in some cases, the dollar. Even smaller companies Mothercare and Hornby were hit by falling currencies in emerging markets. Iowan Smith, a strategist at Knight Capital Europe, said the picture was worse than it seemed because many companies have been guiding down expectations or cutting costs to meet forecasts on results day. He said: \"Earnings growth expectations for the biggest European companies have collapsed from more than 9% at the start of December to 0% \u2013 i.e. no growth.\"",

      "bodyText": "If you are one of the many thousands of Australians at risk of being priced out of the property market, you had better wish that Harry Dent has got his sums right. Dent, an American investment guru who uses demographics to forecast economic cycles, thinks the soaring housing market is ready to burst any day now, perhaps reducing values by as much as 50% in some places. Dent, who was in Sydney this week to promote his book The Demographic Cliff, has a formidable record. He claims credit for predicting Japan\u2019s deflationary decade and the US boom and bust of the past 20 years, and has now turned his numbers on Australia. \u201cI don\u2019t see an upside in Australian real estate but there is a lot of downside. If you are going to own a house and live in it forever then perhaps it\u2019s OK to buy a house, but speculative property \u2013 don\u2019t do it.\u201d With housing valued at 10 times average incomes \u2013 the same level as California\u2019s just before the subprime crash \u2013 Dent thinks Australia is heading for a fall which will be sparked by a sharp reversal of the current global economic recovery. \u201cI see a decline in the 30-50% range across Australia, although it may vary from city to city,\u201d he says. \u201cThe rule with bubbles is that they always go back to where the bubble started.

      "bodyText": "Retail space equalling the size of the vast Westfield shopping centre in west London was converted to new uses last year, as the UK's high streets adapted to changing habits. Traditional shop space in excess of 1.7m sq ft was lost in 2013 \u2013 an increase of more than 60% on 2012 \u2013 as betting shops, gyms, bars and restaurants moved into vacant retail premises, according to a report for the industry journal Estates Gazette. Betting shops were the single most prolific type of new entrant, with 106 winning permission to open last year \u2013 but gyms and health clubs took up the most space, at more than 1m sq ft. The UK's high streets are undergoing a rapid transformation, as shoppers trim their spending and buy more online but continue to look for local leisure services and experiences. Change has also been driven by variations in the planning rules, which came into force in May last year and made it easier for developers to change the use of buildings. Nadia Elghamry, data editor at Estates Gazette, said: \"Across the country, councils are permitting the majority of applications from betting shops and are only turning around 10% of applications.\" The new figures show the ease with which bookies are moving into British high streets despite widespread concern, particularly about fixed-odds betting terminals, which have been dubbed \"the crack cocaine of gambling\". Labour has said it would empower local councils to ban the terminals from high streets. Government ministers are waiting for the outcome of research before considering a reduction in the maximum stake on the machines from \u00a3100, which can currently be wagered every 20 seconds. Mike Jones, chair of the Local Government Association's environment and housing board, said: \"Councils warned last year that relaxing planning laws to make it easier for shops to change use would expose our high streets to the risk of being overrun by betting shops, and this research proves our fears are now being realised.\" He said that councils wanted to do more to prevent \"clustering\" of betting shops but were restricted by the planning and licensing system that gave them little power to block applications. On a positive note, the research shows that UK high streets are finding new ways to fill space being vacated by retailers. Reports by the TV retail guru Mary Portas and former Iceland boss Bill Grimsey have suggested that planners and councils need to encourage alternative businesses to move in, or even convert shops into homes, in order to keep town centres alive. Graham Shone, head of Estates Gazette retail research, said high streets needed to follow the trends seen in new shopping centres if they were to appeal to modern consumers. \"New retail developments are built with around 15%-20% of the space dedicated to leisure and restaurant use \u2013 three times the once traditional 5%. If town centres are going to recover, they may have to end up with the same ratio,\" he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 April 2014. The earlier version quoted Nadia Elghamry, data editor at Estates Gazette, as saying: \"Betting shops have boomed during the downturn, doubling their presence on our high street over the past five years.\" That was what Elghamry said in a press release issued by Estates Gazette. However, Estates Gazette now says that was inaccurate, and that what its data does show is that leases for premises in its \"negative clusters\" category (which include bookies, pawnbrokers and charity shops) accounted for 9.1% of all high street property deals signed between July 2012 and June 2013, up from 4.1% of those signed in the 12 months to June 2008. It adds that the number of deals signed in relation to betting shops alone in 2012-13 was 77% greater than the number signed in in 2007-08.",

Then, the PD party, led by Pier-Luigi Bersani, was heading for victory in the general election. But a late rally for Silvio Berlusconi, and a surge of support for <b>Beppe Grillo\u2019s radical Five Star movement</b>, left no party with a clear majority.</p> <p>After weeks of deadlock, president Napolitano managed to hammer out a deal where<b><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/24/enrico-letta-italy-prime-minister-designate\"> PD and Berlusconi\u2019s PDL would form an uneasy coalition with Letta</a></b> - a senior member of PD - at the helm.</p> <p>In his early months Letta was pretty outspoken about the need to fight youth unemployment, warning of the damage that harsh austerity was causing in Europe\u2019s periphery. But much of his time was dominated by Berlusconi, who threatened to bring down Letta\u2019s government in anger at being convicted for tax fraud.</p> <p>Letta won that battle -- <b><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/02/italian-prime-minister-faces-crunch-confidence-vote-live\">dramatically winning a confidence vote in October 2013</a></b>. Berlusconi\u2019s party subsequently split, but enough MPs stayed within the coalition to keep Letta in power.</p> <p>But Letta has not managed to push through many reforms - and has looked increasingly bogged down in recent months.

      "bodyText": "And finally, from Rome, here\u2019s our correspondent Lizzy Davies on the latest drama in Italian politics: Italy\u2018s prime minister, Enrico Letta, will resign on Friday after his centre-left party voted heavily in favour of backing his rival\u2019s call for a new government, a \u201cnew phase\u201d and a \u201cradical programme\u201d of reform. Minutes after the Democratic party\u2019s (PD) national committee backed the 39-year-old Florence mayor Matteo Renzi\u2019s proposal by 136 votes to 16, with two abstentions, Palazzo Chigi - the official residence of the prime minister - said Letta would be going to the Quirinale on Friday to tender his resignation to President Giorgio Napolitano. Letta\u2019s government, which came into being after an unprecedented period of uncertainty following inconclusive elections in February, had been in power for nine-and-a-half months. Renzi, who became leader of the PD in December, is now almost certain to take over as prime minister. In a speech earlier, Renzi had paid tribute to Letta\u2019s government, saying the meeting was not intended to put it \u201con trial\u201d. But, without directly proposing himself as the next premier, he said the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy urgently needed \u201ca new phase\u201d and \u201cradical programme\u201d to push through reforms. The motion made clear \u201cthe necessity and urgency of opening a new phase with a new executive\u201d. The two Tuscan politicians had been engaged in an intense power struggle for days. More here: Italian PM Enrico Letta to resign Reminder - you can scroll back to 1.29pm GMT onwards for highlights of Matteo Renzi\u2019s dramatic speech, and 5.08pm GMT onwards to see how the news of Letta\u2019s resignation broke. That\u2019s a good morning moment to stop the blog. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning to cover the latest developments in Italy, and lots of GDP data from across the eurozone showing which countries grew and which shrunk in the final quarter of 2013. Until then, thanks, and goodnight. GW. Silvio Berlusconi, who quit Letta\u2019s government with a rump of loyal MPs, will also attend tomorrow\u2019s meeting at the presidential palace to choose a new prime minister. Interesting.... Angelino Alfano, who leads the centre-right faction in the current Italian coalition, has given cautious support to Matteo Renzi, but cautioned that he can\u2019t guarantee reaching a deal with him. Here\u2019s the snaps: ITALY COALITION PARTNER ALFANO SAYS APPRECIATES \u201cCLARITY\u201d OF RENZI\u2019S PROPOSAL AND FACT WANTS TO KEEP SAME RULING COALITION ITALY COALITION PARTNER ALFANO SAYS SUPPORT FOR RENZI DEPENDS ON AGREEMENT OVER POLICY ITALY COALITION PARTNER ALFANO SAYS RENZI GOVERNMENT MUST LAST AS LONG AS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE REFORMS, NOT NECESSARILY UNTIL 2018 ITALY COALITION PARTNER ALFANO SAYS WANTS TO SEE IF CAN WORK WITH RENZI ON ON LABOUR MARKET, TAX POLICY ITALY COALITION PARTNER ALFANO SAYS TAKING NOTHING FOR GRANTED AND NOT SURE THAT ATTEMPT TO FORM NEW GOVT WILL SUCCEED Political analysts have suggested that neither side would want to return to the polls until electoral law changes have been pushed through. What went wrong for Enrico Letta? Cast your mind back a year, and no-one was suggesting that the former MEP and Italian minister would become prime minister. Then, the PD party, led by Pier-Luigi Bersani, was heading for victory in the general election. But a late rally for Silvio Berlusconi, and a surge of support for Beppe Grillo\u2019s radical Five Star movement, left no party with a clear majority. After weeks of deadlock, president Napolitano managed to hammer out a deal where PD and Berlusconi\u2019s PDL would form an uneasy coalition with Letta - a senior member of PD - at the helm. In his early months Letta was pretty outspoken about the need to fight youth unemployment, warning of the damage that harsh austerity was causing in Europe\u2019s periphery. But much of his time was dominated by Berlusconi, who threatened to bring down Letta\u2019s government in anger at being convicted for tax fraud. Letta won that battle -- dramatically winning a confidence vote in October 2013. Berlusconi\u2019s party subsequently split, but enough MPs stayed within the coalition to keep Letta in power. But Letta has not managed to push through many reforms - and has looked increasingly bogged down in recent months. The easing of the eurozone crisis has, paradoxically, meant less pressure to take unpopular decisions. It can\u2019t have been a pleasant nine months either. As Lizzy Davies wrote in today\u2019s paper: Recalling the \u201ccrisis situation\u201d in which his government was formed last year, Letta said he had always considered it to be \u201ca government of service\u201d and appeared at pains to stress how unusually difficult his period as prime minister had been, repeatedly declaring he had been living \u201ceach day as if it was the last\u201d. Here\u2019s how the newswires are reporting the news: Associated Press Italian Premier Enrico Letta says he is resigning after a party rival withdrew crucial government support. Letta said Thursday that he will hand in his resignation to Italy\u2019s president on Friday. Letta was virtually forced to resign after his Democratic Party\u2019s leader, Florence Mayor Matteo Renzi, pulled support for Letta\u2019s tattered, 10-month-old governing coalition. Renzi wants to be premier. Reuters Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta will tender his resignation on Friday after his Democratic Party (PD) called for him to step aside to make way for a new government, a statement from the premier\u2019s office said. Letta will hand his resignation to President Giorgio Napolitano, who is widely expected to ask PD leader Matteo Renzi to form a new government. At just 39, Matteo Renzi would be the youngest PM in Italy\u2019s history -- continuing the generational change begun by Enrico Letta himself, who took office aged 46. More reaction: Matteo Renzi would also become the third unelected Italian prime minister in a row -- following Mario Monti (installed in November 2011 after Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s government collapse) and Letta himself (chosen after last February\u2019s general election delivered a split parliament). Assuming Matteo Renzi is invited to become PM, his next task will be to form a cabinet, and then win a confidence vote in the Italian parliament. That shouldn\u2019t be a serious obstacle - the coalition has a healthy enough majority, as long as the centre-right MPs who also form the government back him. But then the hard work begins - Renzi had painted himself as the man who can shake up Italian politics, demolishing the bad old ways and pushing through the economic reforms that are desperately needed. Delivering that vision will require talent, vision, and guts. Once Enrico Letta tenders his resignation tomorrow, president Georgio Napolitano must choose a new leader. It seems inevitable that he will pick Matteo Renzi -- the Democratic Party are the largest member of the current coalition. Napolitano may not be impressed by the way Renzi has forced Letta out of office after just nine months -- the president was famously brought close to tears last April during the battle to form a new government. IT\u2019S OFFICIAL: Enrico Letta will resign, after seeing his Democratic Party back Matteo Renzi\u2019s call for a new government in the last few minutes. Reuters had the news first: LETTA WILL TENDER RESIGNATION TO NAPOLITANO ON FRIDAY - PM OFFICE STATEMENT - REUTERS THE RESULT IS IN: The Democratic Party have backed Matteo Renzi\u2019s call for a new government, and for prime minister Enrico Letta to step aside. And it\u2019s a landslide result -- a total of 136 members voted in favour, with just 16 against, and 2 abstaining. As covered at 2.39pm onwards, Renzi made a passionate call for change in Italian politics, and a new phase to tackle the country\u2019s economic problems It\u2019s getting tense over in Italy.... The dollar has weakened today, since the worst-than-expected retail sales and jobless claims data was released at 1.30pm GMT. This pushed the gold price back over $1,300 for the first time since November, and drove the pound to a two and a half-year high of $1.667. There\u2019s a hefty police presence outside the Democratic Party headquarters as the leadership meeting continues: A calm end to trading in Milan -- the FTSE MIB closing down just 0.2%. Italian politics appears to have lost the power to shock traders. And Italian bonds are also unshaken - trading slightly higher tonight, which has pushed down the yield on 10-year debt to 3.71%, from 3.73% yesterday. The Democratic Party committee is expected vote later today on whether to back Matteo Renzi\u2019s call for a new government (effectively a vote of no confidence in prime minister Letta) There is no panic, at all, in the financial markets over the prospect of the Italian prime minister being forced to resign. Italian 10-year bond yields (the measure of how much it costs the country to borrow) are actually slightly LOWER this afternoon at 3.72%. Two years ago, Silvio Berlusconi was ejected from office when those yields soared over 7% - showing Italy was losing the ability to finance its own debts. Since then, Mario Monti and then Enrico Letta have pushed some structural reforms though. The big change, though, is that the European Central Bank pledged to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the eurozone -- by buying unlimited quantities of short-term debt if needed. In Milan, the main Italian stock market (the FTSE MIB) is only down 0.7% - in line with other markets today. It\u2019s all terribly Italian: A series of senior party members have been speaking (livefeed here), and broadly backing Matteo Renzi\u2019s call for change. Need to get up to speed on the latest Italian political crisis? Then check out Lizzy Davies\u2019s piece in today\u2019s paper - it explains how Matteo Renzi has been firing steady criticism at Enrico Letta since becoming head of the PD party in December*. Italian PM Enrico Letta\u2019s government in danger of collapse (Renzi had originally LOST the race to become PD leader in December 2012. His victor, Pier-Luigi Bersani, then botched the job of winning the general election in Spring 2013, and was later ousted. That election produced a hung parliament, leading [eventually] to Enrico Letta being summoned to become coalition PM). Here\u2019s some instant reaction to Matteo Renzi\u2019s call for a new Italian government: Here\u2019s Reuters early take Italian centre-left leader Matteo Renzi on Thursday piled pressure on Prime Minister Enrico Letta to resign, telling his Democratic Party (PD) at a leadership meeting that Italy needs a new government. Renzi is widely expected to succeed Letta as prime minister if the PD leadership approves his proposal at the end of the meeting. Renzi called for \u201ca new phase with a new government backed by the same coalition forces.\u201d Renzi thanked Letta, who is also a member of the PD, for his service to the country and said snap elections were not the best way forward for Italy.  As mentioned earlier this afternoon, Letta has cancelled two trips to European countries later this month -- fuelling speculation that his future is in doubt. So what has Matteo Renzi said, and what does it mean? The rising talent of centre-left Italian politics (compared to Blair or Schr\u00f6der in some quarters) has demanded a change of political direction and a \u201cnew government\u201d, but not new elections. That, political analyst Alberdo Nardelli says, means one thing -- Renzi is making his pitch to become Italy\u2019s next prime minister, for the long haul too. PD are one of the two partners in the current coalition, along with a centre-right group led by Angelino Alfano, Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s former right-hand man. Renzi just finished speaking - and was received with warm applause from the PD audience. Matteo Renzi (seen by some as Italy\u2019s best hope of a reforming leader) went on to warn that Italy\u2019s credibility is at risk, if the situation does not change. (critics of Enrico Letta say he has failed to drive through structural reforms over a nine-month period dominated by the travails of Silvio Berlusconi) Matteo Renzi says Italy\u2019s outdated electoral system mean it wouldn\u2019t be possible to hold a \u201csuccessful\u201d vote right now. In other words, he\u2019s arguing against a snap election -- suggesting that Democratic Party should NOT withdraw from the current government and trigger another ballot. Launching a new government in the current parliament would also be risky, he adds. Tapping the lectern firmly at one stage, Matteo Renzi thanked Enrico Letta for his work as prime minister since April 2013. He then talks about the need to open a new phase in Italian politics! 14:39 - ITALY CENTRE-LEFT LEADER RENZI SAYS DEMOCRATIC PARTY THANKS PM LETTA FOR WORK IN GOVERNMENT 14:40 - ITALY CENTRE-LEFT LEADER RENZI SAYS NEW PHASE NEEDS TO BE OPENED 14:41 - ITALY CENTRE-LEFT LEADER RENZI SAYS NEW GOVERNMENT NEEDED WITH SAME COALITION BACKING Matteo Renzi, the centre-left leader who might, perhaps, be poised to usurp prime minister Letta, has begun speaking at the Democratic Party\u2019s meeting. Live stream here Sounds like the Italian PM (at the time of writing) has also scrapped a visit to the Netherlands.... Enrico Letta, Italy\u2019s prime minister, has cancelled his official visit to the UK, which was due to take place on the 24th and 25th of February, according to the excellent Fast FT. The visit would have included a lecture at the London School of Economics and meetings with both investors and representatives of the UK government. The cancellation of the visit will add to the sense of uncertainty which has surrounded the political future of Mr Letta ever since Matteo Renzi, the secretary of Mr Letta\u2019s Democratic Party, moved against him in an attempt to replace him as prime minister. Italian premier cancels UK visit Here\u2019s the link to watch the Italian Democratic Party\u2019s press conference, where it will back or try to sack prime minister Letta: They\u2019ve moved onto jazz now... Update: But alas, not for long US retail sales are also weaker than expected, helping to push shares down in Europe (Wall Street opens under 30 minutes). Sales fell 0.4% in January (against expectations of a flat reading), and were unchanged if you stripped out sales of new cars. November and December\u2019s figures were also revised down. Analysts at Capital Economics say the drop suggests the US recovery was less robust: January\u2019s US retail sales data suggest that fourth-quarter GDP growth may be revised down by an additional 0.1 ppts and that first-quarter growth may be weaker than we previously thought. James Knightley of ING pointed to the recent (ongoing) bad weather in the US: Furniture sales fell 0.6%, as did health and personal care with clothing down 0.9%, sporting goods down 1.4% and eating and drinking retailers saw sales fall 0.6%. This is more understandable given the \u201cpolar vortex\u201d clearly disrupted retailers activities and deterred consumers from going out to shop. The latest US weekly jobs data is weaker than expected -- with 339,000 new claims for unemployment benefit filed in the last week, UP from 331,000 the previous seven days. That has hit sentiment on Wall Street, and knocked European markets lower -- with the FTSE 100 now down 55 points at 6619, a drop of 0.8%. My colleague Sean Farrell has been finding out why investors took Rolls-Royce\u2019s warning this morning quite so badly (see our early morning post), sending its shares tumbling almost 17% at pixel time. It appears that management, despite their protestations that a slowdown was foreseeable, had failed to keep the market abreast of developments: Here\u2019s what Tina Cook, an analyst at Charles Stanley, told Sean: For the past few years Rolls-Royce\u2019s defence business has been outperforming its defence peers. Analysts have been asking about that for the last two years so it\u2019s quite a shock for it to be downgraded so much. There was a genuine belief that [resilience] was sustainable. Management has given very good guidance for the year but perhaps has fallen short on longer term guidance. It\u2019s raised a lot of questions and that is clearly reflected in what has happened to the share price, which is dramatic, especially for a company such as Rolls-Royce. Enrico Letta will not be attending the Democratic Party meeting that might seal his fate as PM -- he\u2019ll be dealing with matters of state in his office, according to Reuters: Back in Italy, tension is rising as the Democratic Party\u2019s committee prepares to decide whether to back prime minister Enrico Letta, or try to supplant him with their leader, Matteo Renzi. That meeting starts at 3pm local time, or 2pm GMT. Although stock prices are down, there is little reaction in the bond market -- the Italy Treasury held a successful debt auction this morning. Renzi could, potentially, become the third man in a row to become an unelected Italian PM -- Giovanni Toti, political adviser to former centre-right Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, has criticised the way Renzi is playing the situation, telling RAI state television. This is a very dangerous operation by Renzi both for the country and for himself \u201dHe was supposed to be the outsider who was going to renew the PD. Now, as soon as he gets close to power, he\u2019s behaving exactly like all the others. Italian politics expert Alberto Nardelli makes a similar point: Another tweet capturing the more cynical reaction to the deal: Here\u2019s our news story on the deal: Comcast announces $42bn takeover of Time Warner Cable US cable TV giant Comcast has agreed to buy rival Time Warner Cable in a $45.2bn (\u00a325.5bn) deal that unites the country\u2019s two biggest cable TV operators and will control more than a third of the market. Comcast, which owns the NBC broadcast network and the Universal film studio, offered $158.82-a-share to take over Time Warner Cable (TWC), which owns movie channel HBO and Time Magazine. Shares in Time Warner Cable have jumped in pre-market trading, but they\u2019re some way below the $158 offer price. TWC shares have risen from $135 last night to $147, having been above $151 earlier. That suggests some concern on Wall Street that regulators will block the bid. Comcast shares are down 4% in early trading. Time Warner Cable has accepted Comcast\u2019s wooing after fighting off the advances of another cable operator, Charter Communications. Charter\u2019s offer of $132.50 per share had been rejected as \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d by TWC -- and has now been trampled by Comcast\u2019s $158 per share offer. Brian Roberts, chairman and CEO of Comcast, has told CNBC that he is \u201coptimistic\u201d that regulators will approve the deal to buy Time Warner. Roberts said it was a \u201creally special transaction\u201d for both company\u2019s shareholders, employees and TWC and Comcast, our shareholders, our employees and especially our customers. The deal is pro-competitive, it\u2019s pro-consumer. We are going to be able to bring better products, faster internet, more channels, on demand TV everywhere, on a national local platform that\u2019s really special. So we\u2019re optimistic we can get this approved. TWC\u2019s chief executive, Rob Marcus, is also in the studio, and said the deal does not include a break fee -- ie, no penalty to Comcast if the merger collapses. Skimming Twitter, there\u2019s plenty of Americans voicing concerns that merging Comcast and Time Warner Cable is bad for competition. And one favourite from overnight,as rumours of an impending deal broke... What\u2019s in it for customers? Comcast (not the most impartial judge of its own services), claims households and businesses will benefit. Here\u2019s the logic: Comcast\u2019s subscribers today have access to the most comprehensive video experience, including the cloud-based X1 Entertainment Operating System, plus 50,000 video on demand choices on television, 300,000 plus streaming choices on XfinityTV.com, Xfinity TV mobile apps that offer 35 live streaming channels plus the ability to download to watch offline later, and the newly launched X1 cloud DVR. Comcast is also a technology leader in broadband and has increased Internet speeds 12 times in the past 12 years across its entire footprint..... Time Warner Cable will combine its unique products and services with Comcast\u2019s, including StartOver, which allows customers to restart a live program in progress to the beginning, and LookBack, which allows customers to watch programs up to three days after they air live, all without a DVR. Time Warner Cable also has been a leader in the deployment of community Wi-Fi, and will combine its more than 30,000 hotspots, primarily in Los Angeles and New York City, and its in-home management system, IntelligentHome, with Comcast\u2019s offerings. Through this merger, more American consumers will benefit from technological innovations, including a superior video experience, higher broadband speeds, and the fastest in-home Wi-Fi. The transaction also will generate significant cost savings and other efficiencies. American businesses will benefit from a broader platform, and the Company will be better able to offer advanced services like high-performance point-to-point and multi-point Ethernet services and cloud-based managed services to enterprises. Additionally, the transaction will combine complementary advertising platforms and channels and allow Comcast to offer broader and more valuable packages to national advertisers. Here\u2019s the full statement. Comcast is planning to keep its investors sweet with a $10bn share buyback. It also says the deal will yield around $1.5bn in \u201coperating efficiencies\u201d -- much loved by investment bankers looking to nail a deal, but bad news for back-office workers whose roles can now be combined. Comcast is already the biggest pay TV operator in America, and Time Warner Cable is number 2, so the merger will create a real powerhouse. Analysts have calculated that a combined Comcast/TWC would control about 33 million pay TV subscribers in the US, and 32 million broadband customers. Even if Comcast sheds 3 million TWC customers, as planned, it would still be pumping content into around one in four US households. Comcast hopes to complete the deal by the end of 2014 -- clearly anticipating some regulatory challenges. As rumoured overnight, Comcast is paying the equivalent of $158.82 for each Time Warner Cable share -- an 17% premium to last night\u2019s closing price of $135.31. It\u2019s an all-share deal, so Time Warner investors will get 2.875 Comcast shares for each TWC they own. BREAKING: It\u2019s official: Comcast is buying Time Warner Cable in an all-share deal that values TWC at $45.2bn -- forming a pay-TV giant. The deal will create a \u201cworld-class technology and media company\u201d, Comcast says. And as flagged up this morning, Comcast is pledging to divest 3 million TWC customers in a bid to address \u201ccompetition concerns. More to follow.... National Bank economist Nikos Magginas says the drop-off in the Greek tourist trade last November pushed its jobless rate up: \u201cAs expected, the labour market showed a lagging reaction to other positive signs in the economy. The increase in unemployment is also due to a loss of support from tourism which was seen in the previous months.\u201d Via Reuters. If you don\u2019t adjust for seasonal factors (tourism, agricultural work, etc), then the Greek jobless total really spiked in November: Today\u2019s data confirms that 2013 was another rough year for Greeks - the number of people in work fell by 112,752 since November 2012, with an extra 35,726 losing their jobs between October 2013 and November 2013. The total classed as \u201cunemployed\u201d (rather than inactive) rose by 78,041 over the last year, a rise of six percentage points, to the fresh high of 28.0%. Early reaction to the grim news that Greece\u2019s unemployment rate is now 28% - compared to a eurozone average of 12% Bad economic news out of Greece, which should dampen the claims that the country has put the worst of its financial crisis behind it. The unemployment rate in Greece hit an all time high of 28% in November, up from 27.7% in October, on a seasonally adjusted basis. And the youth unemployment rate was 61.4%, reinforcing fears that the eurozone crisis has created a generation of young people who whose career changes are permanently harmed. Statistics body Elstat reported that there were 3,550,679 people employed in Greece, 1,382,062 unemployed, and a further 3,376,643 classed as inactive. In recent months Elstat has claimed that the unemployment rate in Greece had stabilised, but today\u2019s data shows that it climbed to previously unseen levels: The data also shows that the number of unemployed people in Greece has jumped over 200% since the collapse of Lehman Brothers - from 383,000 in November 2008 to 1.38m now. Reaction to follow.... The political tensions in Italy have hit shares on the country\u2019s stock market. The FTSE MIB has shed 225 points to 19,916, a drop of 1.9%, as traders await the result of the tussle between prime minister Enrico Letta and PD leader Matteo Renzi. As MrWicket pointed out in the comments below, Letta has declined to simply slink away and is making a fight of it. Someone\u2019s going to come out of this tussle bruised, or at least embarrassed.... On the Comcast - Time Warner Cable deal, this tweet from US journalism tutor Dan Kennedy sums up the concerns: The top civil servant at the Treasury has formally given the thumbs down to a currency union: Heads-up: chancellor George Osborne is giving a speech explaining why an independent Scotland wouldn\u2019t be allowed to keep the pound. Osborne said that the size of Scotland\u2019s banking sector (12 times larger than its GDP) means it would need banking union - which the UK wouldn\u2019t be willing to join as it would face potentially huge bills with little support for its banks from the Scots. He also warned that a currency union would only work with tight fiscal controls -- saying the SNP\u2019s claim that tax rates would be exempt were \u201ca million miles\u201d from the controls that Bank of England governor Mark Carney believes are needed. Our politics liveblogger Andy Sparrow is covering the key points here: The speech is part of an unusual alliance between the UK\u2019s three largest parties -- with Labour and the Liberal Democrats also due to rule out a currency union with an independent Scotland. Here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s story on the Lloyds results and bonus payouts: Lloyds Banking Group chief Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio gets \u00a31.7m bonus Bank reports statutory profit of \u00a3415m and announces \u00a3395m bonus pool to be shared between 91,000 staff Unions and fair tax campaigners are outraged that Lloyds Banking Group has handed chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio a \u00a31.7m bonus alongside today\u2019s financial results (see 7.44am onwards) Unite national officer, Rob Macgregor, said the payoff dwarfed the wage rises given to staff last year -- those staff who avoided being laid off: \u201cLloyd\u2019s has slashed over 35,000 jobs since 2008 bringing misery for staff. \u201cProfits have doubled thanks to ordinary workers doing extraordinary work behind the scenes to turn the bank around but they have been rewarded with an insulting 2 per cent pay deal - the lowest pay deal of the big four banks so far. \u201cThe CEO\u2019s 1.7 million bonus, on top of shares worth millions awarded at the end of October are a kick in the teeth to the taxpayer, and to hard-working staff who don\u2019t know if they will be next in line for the chop from one day to the next. \u201cFrom the financial crisis to PPI mis-selling, workers in call centres and branches are being forced to pay the price for past failures which were not of their making, but those at the top continue to enjoy bumper bonuses with the help of taxpayers money.\u201d As well as setting aside \u00a33bn for PPI mis-selling payouts last year, Lloyds also received a record \u00a328m fine for the incentives it dangled before staff to encourage them to sell products to customers. David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, said it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that a bank bailed out by the taxpayer should pay \u201clottery-sized sums\u201d to its top staff. \u201cThe Government should stop pussyfooting around the City and ensure it contributes more positively to the society it should be serving.\u201d The Financial Times has more details of the regulatory hurdle that Comcast has to jump before it can claim Time Warner in its $45bn all-stock deal. The Federal Communications Commission may feel the resulting company would simply have too big a sway over the industry, potentially using its size to drive unfair deals with content providers. Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson Research, said a Comcast-TWC bid \u201cwould face significant antitrust/public interest challenges, particularly with the FCC\u201d. A combined group would control about 33m video subscribers in the US, and 32m total broadband subscribers, Mr Moffett estimates. Insiders say that Comcast will offer to shed three million TMC customers in a bid to appease the regulators. That would keep its customer base below below 30% - which was the maximum national footprint before that cap was thrown out by a federal court five years ago. Back to the Comcast-Time Warner takeover -- there is chatter that the merger to be announced sometime around 11.45am GMT (6.45am New York time). CNBC are expecting the two companies\u2019 CEOs in its studio at noon GMT/7am Eastern Time to discuss the deal. Tate &amp; Lyle has also cut its financial outlook for this year, sending its shares sliding 14%. The sweeteners and ingredients firm warned shareholders that it had suffered \u201csoftness in developed markets\u201d, wiping out some the strong growth in emerging markets. Tate &amp; Lyle admitted that it had forced to swallow less lucrative deals from customers buying its Splenda sweetener -- blaming a \u201csignificant overhang of unsold Chinese sucralose\u201d that had flooded the market. It, like Rolls Royce this morning, now expects no profit growth in 2014. Analysts had expected profits of \u00a3340m, up from \u00a3329m in 2013. Back in the City, and Rolls-Royce has hit investors with the news that it expects profits to be flat this year as defence spending is cut back. The news has sent its shares tumbling 9.5% in early trading -- despite the company beating expectations for 2013. On its conference call, the company admitted that 2014 will be the first time in a decade that it will fail to grow earnings. Sean Farrell tweeted the key points: John Rishton, its CEO, promised shareholders that profit growth would resume in 2015 -- and hinted at further cost-cutting. Our priorities remain the 4Cs: Customer, Concentration, Cost and Cash. There has been good progress on Customer, particularly with on-time delivery. On Concentration, we continue to focus on our two technology platforms of gas turbines and reciprocating engines. We achieved a cash inflow of \u00a3359m and improved our inventory turns. On cost, there is more to do. RR has already cut its \u201cindirect headcount by 11%\u201d in 2013, and plans with further savings this year -- as shifts production away from high cost countries. On the eurozone front - it could be a dramatic day in Italy. The Democratic Party (PD) could be poised to whip away its support from coalition leader Enrico Letta in a move that would put its own leader, Matteo Renzi, in power. PD will hold a national committee meeting today -- at which Renzi could indicate whether he will bid to become Italy\u2019s next prime minister. That would make him the THIRD unelected Italian PM in a row, since Silvio Berlusconi was bundled out of office and into a series of courtroom dramas. The latest word from Italy is that the right-wing coalition party says it will back Letta, as long as the centre-left PD do as well..... Here\u2019s Lizzy Davies\u2019s latest take on the situation: Italian PM Enrico Letta\u2019s government in danger of collapse City editor Jill Treanor was on the early-morning Lloyds conference call, , and reports that Horta-Osorio defended his \u00a31.7m bonus: Horta-Osorio also told reporters that the bank could return fully to the private sector whenever the government was ready to sell shares, and has held \u201cconstructive and productive\u201d discussions with regulators over its plans to pay dividends to its huge army of shareholders. While Lloyds staff are sharing \u00a3395m in bonuses, CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio is personally taking home \u00a31.7m after hitting his targets - including keeping Lloyds\u2019 share price over the level at which the government could sell its stake without making a loss. Meanwhile in the UK, Lloyds Banking Group has - finally - posted a profit for the first time since the financial crisis. A few minutes ago it reported a statutory profit before tax of \u00a3415m for 2013 (compared to a loss of \u00a3606m in 2012), despite paying another \u00a33bn in compensation over the PPI mis-selling scandal. Chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio sounds upbeat this morning -- saying the results should help the taxpayer to shed its large stake in Lloyds (acquired when the bank was rescued in the financial crisis) These results, with Group underlying profit more than doubled to \u00a36.2 billion, confirm that the Group is returning to robust health, thanks to the commitment of our people and the consistent execution of the strategy we set out in June 2011. We have a strong business model and have made significant progress, despite our legacy issues, in improving our capital position and profitability in a sustainable way. As a result, the UK Government started the process of returning the Group to full private ownership. Lloyds is holding a conference call now - we\u2019ll have highlights in a moment... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and business. Two big corporate news stories to start the morning -- a mega deal that will combine America\u2019s two biggest cable companies, and the long-awaited return to profitability at one of Britain\u2019s largest banks. Comcast is expected to announce today that it has hammered out a massive $45bn deal to take control of fellow pay-TV giant Time Warner Cable. It would cement Comcast\u2019s position as the US\u2019s biggest cable operator (TWC is number two). The deal faces tough regulatory scrutiny, though -- as it would create a huge player with over 33 million subscribers. The deal also ends a long fight over ownership of TWC, with Comcast thwarting rival firm Charter\u2019s own ambitions with a knockout bid , worth $158 per share. CNBC, which broke the deal earlier this morning, explains: The agreement comes more than eight months after Charter Communications and Liberty Media made their first foray to try and negotiate a deal to acquire Time Warner Cable (a story broken by CNBC) and follows months of conversations between Time Warner Cable and Comcast about the prospect of a Comcast acquisition of the company. Charter\u2019s offer of roughly $133 a share in cash and stock has been rejected by Time Warner Cable as it held out for a price of $160, which it has said is reflective of where an asset of its size and scope should trade in a deal. Analysts are speculating that Charter (partly owned by cable veteran John Malone) might yet hit back. And some customers are already fretting that the deal will cut competition in the industry and lead to worse services -- although the two companies largely compete in different parts of the US. Our early news story on the deal is here: Comcast to buy Time Warner Cable Lots more reaction to follow....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group has awarded its chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio a \u00a31.7m bonus after declaring itself \"a normal bank\" five years after its bailout. With preparations under way for a sale of the taxpayer's remaining 33% stake, Horta-Os\u00f3rio played down the impact of Scottish independence on the bailed-out bank, which owns Bank of Scotland. The Portuguese banker \u2013 who took the top job in March 2011 \u2013 was forced to defend his decision to accept the bonus after union leaders called on him to follow rivals at Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays and waive his payout. Horta-Os\u00f3rio pointed to last year's 70% rise in the share price, which allowed the government to sell off part of its stake last September. There are expectations that a further share sale could begin after the annual report is published on 6 March. \"We are ready to proceed,\" he said. \"The market, I think, is ready as well. I came to Lloyds three years ago to fix this bank and help taxpayers get their money back.\" He said he had stabilised the bank after its \"quite precarious\" position when he took charge, and declared that Lloyds was now \"a normal bank\". But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady was unimpressed. \"With Lloyds still owing billions to the taxpayer and the amount it has had to set aside for PPI mis-selling rising by a whopping \u00a31.8bn, now is not the time for its chief executive to be taking a multimillion-pound bonus.\" Unite national officer Rob MacGregor said the payout to the boss \u2013 in a year when staff pay rose 2% and after 35,000 roles had been lost since the 2008 bailout \u2013 was a \"kick in the teeth to the taxpayer\". Horta-Os\u00f3rio will receive the \u00a31.7m share bonus only if half of the remaining taxpayer holding is sold or if the share price remains above 73.6p \u2013 the breakeven point of the taxpayer bailout \u2013 for six months. He will then be required to hold the shares until 2019. A bonus pool of \u00a3395m will be shared between 91,000 staff and payouts will average \u00a34,500 per worker. The bank insisted the payout pot had been reduced as a result of the bank's vast bill for compensating customers for mis-selling payment protection insurance \u2013 which has now reached nearly \u00a310bn \u2013 and last year's \u00a328m fine from the Financial Conduct Authority for a \"champagne\" bonus culture that potentially encouraged mis-selling. The bank reported a statutory profit of \u00a3415m \u2013 and a loss of \u00a3802m after tax \u2013 after being rocked by a \u00a33bn charge for PPI mis-selling. It admitted a week ago that its total PPI mis-selling bill is now \u00a39.8bn and former boss Eric Daniels is among those facing a potential clawback of bonuses after the bigger than expected compensation claims. Lloyds reported a \u00a3606m loss a year ago while the underlying profit for 2013 was \u00a36.2bn, double a year ago. Horta-Os\u00f3rio's bonus comes on top of his \u00a31m salary, \u00a3500,000 pension contribution and a payout from a long-term incentive plan that could total \u00a32.9m \u2013 half the potential sum \u2013 when it is formally revealed next month. He has now begun work on a new three-year strategic plan for the bank, which is being forced to spin off its TSB brand under the terms of its bailout, in a move that could signal branch closures. Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, which on Tuesday blasted Barclays for paying higher bonuses when profits were falling, said Lloyds needed to be \"sensitive to taxpayer perceptions when making decisions on remuneration and bonuses\". Horta-Os\u00f3rio agreed it was a \"bad principle\" to pay out higher bonuses when profits were down as Barclays had done. Following calls by Ed Miliband to shake up high street banking by create two new players, Horta-Os\u00f3rio said this would be achieved by TSB \u2013 to be floated in the coming months \u2013 and the separation of Williams &amp; Glyn's from RBS. However, the Lloyds boss conceded that competition was more of a concern in the small business banking market, currently being reviewed by the Office of Fair Trading. The shares closed down 2% at 81.32p. The bank warned last week that it would not be able to resume dividends until towards the end of this year, later than some analysts had hoped. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said: \"The statutory losses are heavier than had been assumed and the forward guidance is softer than frothier market expectations\". Fine fears at BNP BNP Paribas, France's biggest listed bank, has set aside $1.1bn (\u00a3660m) to cover a possible fine for breaching US sanctions on countries including Iran, the latest bank to take a hit to profit from a legal investigation. Banks across the world are under investigation for a string of alleged misdeeds, including fixing benchmark interest rates and manipulating foreign exchange markets. They are also facing tougher rules in the wake of the financial crisis. This month, Credit Suisse set aside SFr514m (\u00a3346m) to cover US investigations, while in January Deutsche Bank blamed legal costs for a surprise quarterly loss. BNP said on Thursday it had set aside the funds after talks with the US authorities, though it said there had been no discussion on the size of any potential penalty. \"We've been doing a retrospective review for several years and we've basically now presented our findings to the U.S. authorities,\" BNP Chief Financial Officer Lars Machenil told Reuters Insider TV. Standard Chartered agreed in 2012 to pay $327m (\u00a3196m) to resolve allegations that it violated US sanctions against Iran, Sudan, Burma and Libya. BNP shares were down 4.1% to \u20ac58.38, the biggest fall on the STOXX 600 Europe banks index. Reuters",

The bank insisted the payout pot had been reduced as a result of the bank's vast bill for compensating customers for mis-selling payment protection insurance \u2013 which has now reached nearly \u00a310bn \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/11/lloyds-mis-selling-scandal-champagne-bonuses\" title=\"\">last year's \u00a328m fine from the Financial Conduct Authority</a> for a \"champagne\" bonus culture that potentially encouraged mis-selling.</p> <p>The bank reported a statutory profit of \u00a3415m \u2013 and a loss of \u00a3802m after tax \u2013 after being rocked by a \u00a33bn charge for PPI mis-selling. It admitted a week ago that its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/03/lloyds-ppi-compensation-bill-10-billion-pounds\" title=\"\">total PPI mis-selling bill is now \u00a39.8bn</a> and former boss Eric Daniels is among those facing a potential clawback of bonuses after the bigger than expected compensation claims.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/01/lloyds-horta-osorio-bonus-ppi-loss\" title=\"\">Lloyds reported a \u00a3606m loss a year ago</a> while the underlying profit for 2013 was \u00a36.2bn, double a year ago.</p> <p>Horta-Os\u00f3rio's bonus comes on top of his \u00a31m salary, \u00a3500,000 pension contribution and a payout from a long-term incentive plan that could total \u00a32.9m \u2013 half the potential sum \u2013 when it is formally revealed next month.</p> <p>He has now begun work on a new three-year strategic plan for the bank, which is being forced to spin off its TSB brand under the terms of its bailout, in a move that could signal branch closures.</p> <p>Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, which on Tuesday blasted Barclays for paying higher bonuses when profits were falling, said Lloyds needed to be \"sensitive to taxpayer perceptions when making decisions on remuneration and bonuses\".</p> <p>Horta-Os\u00f3rio agreed it was a \"bad principle\" to pay out higher bonuses when profits were down as Barclays had done. Following calls by Ed Miliband to shake up high street banking by create two new players, Horta-Os\u00f3rio said this would be achieved by TSB \u2013 to be floated in the coming months \u2013 and the separation of Williams &amp; Glyn's from RBS.</p> <p>However, the Lloyds boss conceded that competition was more of a concern in the small business banking market, currently being reviewed by the Office of Fair Trading.</p> <p>The shares closed down 2% at 81.32p. The bank warned last week that it would not be able to resume dividends until towards the end of this year, later than some analysts had hoped.</p> <p>Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said: \"The statutory losses are heavier than had been assumed and the forward guidance is softer than frothier market expectations\".</p> <h2><strong>Fine fears at BNP</strong></h2> <p>BNP Paribas, France's biggest listed bank, has set aside $1.1bn (\u00a3660m) to cover a possible fine for breaching US sanctions on countries including Iran, the latest bank to take a hit to profit from a legal investigation.</p> <p>Banks across the world are under investigation for a string of alleged misdeeds, including fixing benchmark interest rates and manipulating foreign exchange markets. They are also facing tougher rules in the wake of the financial crisis.</p> <p>This month, Credit Suisse set aside SFr514m (\u00a3346m) to cover US investigations, while in January Deutsche Bank blamed legal costs for a surprise quarterly loss. BNP said on Thursday it had set aside the funds after talks with the US authorities, though it said there had been no discussion on the size of any potential penalty.</p> <p>\"We've been doing a retrospective review for several years and we've basically now presented our findings to the U.S. authorities,\" BNP Chief Financial Officer Lars Machenil told Reuters Insider TV.</p> <p>Standard Chartered agreed in 2012 to pay $327m (\u00a3196m) to resolve allegations that it violated US sanctions against Iran, Sudan, Burma and Libya.</p> <p>BNP shares were down 4.1% to \u20ac58.38, the biggest fall on the STOXX 600 Europe banks index. <strong>Reuters</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "The cosmetics company Avon Products said on Thursday that it faced a bill for up to $132m (\u00a380m) to settle a US bribery investigation into the company's drive to expand overseas. Avon, famous for its army of Avon Lady sales reps, has had problems regarding its Chinese business since 2008, just two years after it started trading in the country, when it launched an internal inquiry into allegations of improper payments in China. In 2011 the US securities and exchange commission and the US justice department began an investigation under American law defined by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The inquiries have so far cost Avon $300m. The company, which sacked four senior executives in 2011, said on Thursday that there were no assurances that it would reach a settlement and if it did, the company could not estimate its timing. The possible settlement of $132m, however, would be about $40m more than the group had set aside and $120m more than it first offered as a settlement. The legal update came as Avon revealed worse than expected recent trading. Sales fell 10% to $2.7bn, while operating losses climbed to $17m. In recent years Avon has been betting on emerging markets for growth to offset a decline in business in the US. But over the last three months trade has deteriorated in Mexico and Russia, and sales fell by half in China. In north America, Avon's sales of beauty products were down 25%. The number of sales reps was down 17%. A bright spot was Brazil, Avon's top market, where sales rose 6%, stripping out the impact of foreign exchange. Avon's net loss narrowed to $69m, or 16 cents per share, from $162m.

Sucralose accounts for one fifth of Tate &amp; Lyle's lucrative speciality food business, which includes a host of unbranded ingredients used to add taste and texture to processed food. Demand for these products has been increasing sharply in recent years, with double-digit growth in parts of Asia and Latin America as more people get a taste for pre-prepared foods and fizzy drinks. Tate's latest half year results show sucralose earned the company revenues of \u00a3106m in a speciality foods division worth \u00a3519m. The company said it saw \"good long term opportunities for growth\" in the Splenda market, and was expecting profit growth for its other speciality products.",

      "bodyText": "In a mixed day for company results, Tate and Lyle is taking the wooden spoon. The sweetener specialist had some sour news for shareholders, cutting its estimate for the full year below City expectations. The news sent its shares tumbling 136.5p or 17.5% to 650p, making it the biggest faller in a downbeat FTSE 100. Tate said it expected annual profits to be in line with the previous year's total of \u00a3329m, below analyst forecasts of \u00a3340m. As it headed into its final quarter, it said third quarter profit was below its expectations. The company, which supplies sweeteners and other ingredients to food and drink makers, blamed weak sales in developed markets and a drop in sucralose prices. Darren Shirley at Shore Capital said: Tate &amp; Lyle has worked in recent years to improve visibility and build control over it profits stream through investment in its speciality food ingredients [SFI] infrastructure. However, today's statements confirms to us that despite such investment, large elements of the bulk ingredients (and it appears) Sucralose profit streams remain out of the companies control, whilst volume momentum from SFI still remains modest. We retain our hold stance today, though expect weakness in the share price. Tate is not the only company suffering from a disappointing update. A day after two people were arrested in connection with Rolls-Royce's dealings in Asia, the company has said sharp cuts in defence spending in the US and Europe would mean no profit growth in 2014. As a result, its shares have dropped 141p to \u00a310.89 or nearly 12%. On the other side of the coin, Amec has added 58p to \u00a311.50 and Imperial Tobacco is up 112p at \u00a323.37 after well received updates. But the Tate and Rolls falls have helped push the overall market into the red. The FTSE 100 has fallen 34.44 points to 6635.75, with investors across the globe seeing a pause for breath after recent rises.",

And thus we are also able to bring out the economists and talk about how it will either hit certain areas hard, or won\u2019t be so much as a blip.</p> <p>At times like this it\u2019s very easy to throw around the big numbers. The common one this week has been that while there are about 45,000 workers in the car industry, about 350,000 people each month change jobs \u2013 either through choice or not \u2013 and about the same number get a new job.</p> <p>So it\u2019s pretty easy to think that 45,000 workers over the next four years is just a drop in the ocean, and not worth worrying about. Of course that 350,000 is Australia-wide, and the car industry is a bit more concentrated.</p> <p>As<a href=\"http://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2014/02/assessing-the-impact-of-the-car-industrys-closure/\"> the National Australia Bank</a> noted, while the car industry accounts for only 0.4% of all workers in Australia and just under 5% of all manufacturing jobs, in Victoria it is rather more important \u2013 accounting for nearly 9% of all manufacturing jobs:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of jobs accounted for by the motor vehicle and parts manufactuing sector\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/mhd8v/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"http://cf.datawrapper.de/mhd8v/3/\">Click here for the graph on mobile</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clearly that is a big hole to fill. And while some might think the demise of the car industry is just a further example of the need for Australia to shift from manufacturing, which in 2000 was our largest employer, we should recognise the total industry remains our fourth-biggest employer \u2013 with 934,000 workers.</p> <p>The decline in the automotive sector has been a part of that overall decline in the manufacturing industry. The<a href=\"http://www.pc.gov.au/projects/inquiry/automotive/position\"> productivity commission\u2019s position paper</a> on the sector noted: \u201cEmployment in automotive manufacturing decreased by about 40 per cent [about 30,000 jobs] over the period 2006 to 2013\u201d.</p> <p>But manufacturing remains important in Australia.
