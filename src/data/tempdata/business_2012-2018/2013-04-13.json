      "bodyText": "The coalition's plans to crack down on Britain's tax havens were discussed at a meeting between David Cameron and chancellor Angela Merkel, amid growing concerns in Germany. Merkel is understood to have had questions about the monitoring of British sovereign territories used as tax havens by the rich. The German public has been alarmed in recent weeks about reports of its citizens using havens to avoid paying taxes at home, and the matter has become an electoral issue. But sources close to Cameron said that he was first to raise the future of the territories in order to spell out how his government was cracking down on tax avoidance in places such as Jersey and Guernsey. A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister was keen, ahead of June's G8 summit in Northern Ireland, to stress that the UK and others \"should show global leadership by taking concrete action on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance and making clear that everyone must pay their fair share of taxes\". The two leaders also agreed on the \"urgent need\" to make Europe more \"competitive and flexible\", according to Downing Street. The spokesman added: \"They discussed how we can work together in the runup to the May and June European councils to make further progress.\" In his keynote speech on Britain's future in Europe earlier this year, Cameron pledged to hold a referendum during the early part of the next parliament \u2013 by the end of 2017 at the latest \u2013 if the Tories win the next general election. He has argued a new settlement is needed before UK voters are asked if they want to end ties with Brussels. A Downing Street source said there was agreement from Merkel that there would be the necessary treaty change at some point although there has been no agreement yet on timing or the substance of the changes. After the meeting outside Berlin, Number 10 said both had also agreed that they wanted faster progress on trade deals between the EU and the rest of the world and that the EU should be prepared to make an \"ambitious offer\" in trade talks with the US. The prime minister arrived in Berlin with his family on Friday and was staying at Schloss Meseberg, the chancellor's official guest residence in the Brandenburg countryside. A spokesman said that areas of agreement were also found on Syria and Afghanistan. He said: \"The PM updated the chancellor on the trilateral talks with presidents Karzai and Zardari and they discussed how the international community should work in partnership with Afghanistan to support the country beyond 2014. \"On Syria, they share grave concerns about the deteriorating situation and the ongoing bloodshed. They agreed that the UK and Germany should keep working together to find ways to increase the pressure on Assad and his regime while also strengthening the moderate opposition.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne's controversial efforts to rekindle the housing market will help to prevent Britain's economy from flatlining this year, according to a forecast. In its quarterly health check of the economy, the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club said a million homes would change hands in 2013, 5% more than in 2012 and the highest number since 2007. \"We expect a million households to move this year, helping growing families and labour mobility,\" said Peter Spencer, author of the report, which is the only independent forecast to use the Treasury's model of the economy. \"Sales of household appliances and other expenditures involved in moving home will also be buoyant.\" The Treasury has announced a series of measures to underpin the housing market, including a \"funding for lending\" scheme, which offers cheap loans to banks and aims to bring down mortgage costs. In last month's budget, the chancellor also promised to introduce a taxpayer-backed mortgage guarantee scheme from 2014. The policies have been criticised by some analysts, who warned that because many households were still sitting on heavy mortgage debts from the boom years, reinflating house prices would be dangerous. With the new scheme set to be available on properties worth up to \u00a3600,000, Osborne has also been accused of giving help to wealthy buyers. However, Spencer insisted that the \"rebalancing\" that Osborne had hoped for \u2013 away from debt-fuelled growth and towards exports \u2013 would be impossible while the eurozone economy, Britain's biggest export market, remained so weak. \"Although it's not a long-term strategy, stimulating the housing market and the high street will keep GDP growth positive. Unbalanced growth is better than no growth,\" he said. He added that household debts in the UK had fallen since the start of the financial crisis, from an average of 174% of annual income to 146%. Even with a housing market revival, Item expects the economy to eke out growth of just 0.6% this year and 1.9% in 2014, which is still a more optimistic projection than other forecasters. City consultancy Fathom, for example, has pencilled in growth of just 0.2%. A Treasury spokeswoman said: \"The government is committed to building a stronger economy and this report highlights the real and positive impacts of government policies to support hard-working families and those who aspire to own their own homes.\" Richard Donnell, director of research at housing research company Hometrack, said: \"I definitely think the air of optimism will continue to grow, but I don't think we're suddenly going to see strong house price growth.\" He pointed out that while prices in London and towns such as Oxford and Reading had already regained the dizzy heights set at the height of the market in 2007, in Liverpool and Glasgow they remained 20% below their peak. The government is watching anxiously to see if the latest GDP figures, to be published on 24 April, will reveal that the economy slipped into an unprecedented triple-dip recession at the start of the year. The latest jobs figures, to be published on Wednesday, could also show that unemployment has begun to increase, after declining through much of last year. Howard Archer, of information analysts Global Insight, said: \"We expect the labour market data to show further signs of fraying strength in reaction to the economy's persistent softness.\" As well as encouraging British families to head to the estate agents, the government is also hoping that the arrival of the new Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, this summer will mark a shift to a more aggressive policy in Threadneedle Street \u2013 by promising to keep interest rates at their current rock-bottom levels for an extended period, for example. However, Spencer suggested that monetary policy was unlikely to provide much extra support to growth. \"Although monetary policy is good at cushioning a recession, it is bad at stimulating a recovery,\" the report said.",

This is a long way short of the 33% required to reach Davies's target. It is also a marked slowdown on rates seen for the preceding six months \u2013 44% and 36% for FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies respectively. Women now hold 17.3% of FTSE 100 directorships, but just 5.8% of executive roles, and 21.8% of non-executive posts.</p> <p>The deceleration in progress may, of course, be a statistical quirk, and certainly business secretary Vince Cable was careful not to use too much alarming language when reviewing the figures.

The worry now is that the easy early gains have been made, and further progress will be much harder to achieve \u2013 especially in terms of getting more women into executive roles.</p> <p>That is illustrated by Cranfield's statistics, which suggest that there are simply not enough women in the pipeline with the necessary experience to get to the top. Its research shows the percentage of women sitting on executive committees \u2013 the management level one layer below the board \u2013 has dropped from 18.1% to 15.3% since 2009. There are probably several reasons for that, including issues such as flexible working and childcare, but it appears that outright discrimination still hampers those who overcome the restrictions. The figures also show that just 48% of female executive directors are internally promoted \u2013 compared with 62% for men. This results in ambitious, capable women feeling forced to leave their current company or accept the Paula Principle.</p> <p>Davies, Cable, CBI president Roger Carr and equalities minister Maria Miller all spoke on these issues last week, and they all seemed to agree that more needs to be done. But none of them expressed a clear vision of exactly what, which is worrying if this slowdown proves more than a blip.</p> <p>It leaves Britain's ambitious businesswomen hoping that those leading the drive for more female directorships have a Plan B, and do not prove to be operating a notch or two above their competence level.</p> <h2>Miserly bailout deal could end in tragedy \u2013 and not just for Cyprus</h2> <p>Even by the eurozone's standards regarding its struggling members, the deal Cyprus's politicians will now be forced to sell to a wary public looks especially miserly.</p> <p>Of the \u20ac23bn total cost of the bailout (\u20ac6bn more than was agreed less than a month ago, by the way), Cyprus is expected to find \u20ac13bn from its own resources. That means as well as the privatisations, public sector layoffs and tax rises that have become familiar from the Greek case, Cyprus will have to sell off a large chunk of its gold reserves, and depositors in the collapsed Laiki bank with more than \u20ac100,000 in savings are likely to find themselves completely wiped out. There are even rumours the bank may not open on Monday morning.</p> <p>Yet, also in a familiar pattern, the calculations on which the rescue is based are still too optimistic: the country is expected to bounce back within a couple of years, despite a collapsed banking industry. Tourism, the country's other main business, will hardly have been enhanced by coverage of shuttered banks and riots.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/12/eurozone-crisis-live-cameron-merkel-eurogroup\" title=\"\">Dublin this weekend</a>, eurozone finance ministers promised Cyprus \"structural funds,\" to help rebuild its economy. But with the banking bust exacerbated by the bungled bailout, it's not clear what exactly they are planning to rebuild.</p> <p>And despite euro-politicians' repeated insistence that the island should not be seen as a \"template\" for future rescues, the raid on bank balances will mean any renewed whiff of crisis in Spain or Italy will send investors fleeing to the safer haven of Germany \u2013 or out of the eurozone altogether. The collateral damage to the whole eurozone banking system may prove far costlier than the bailout.</p> <p>Meanwhile hotel and restaurant-owners may be looking longingly across at the Turkish-occupied half of their island, which can offer a cheap lira and no chance of being stopped at the border and forced to hand over your holiday money. Pressure to leave the euro can only intensify.</p> <h2>Let us applaud HBOS's Crosby \u2013 for having a conscience</h2> <p>There has been an absence of morality, and of a reckoning, in the aftermath of the British banking crash \u2013 until recent weeks. The report into HBOS by the parliamentary commission on banking standards has provided the catharsis, adding empirical clarity to a public anger that has raged without a focal point since 2008.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/09/james-crosby-give-up-knighthood-pension\" title=\"\">subsequent statement</a> by former chief executive Sir James Crosby is also one of the first genuine acts of atonement to emerge from that era. He was not legally obliged to ask for the retraction of his knighthood, or give up 30% of his pension, but the moral imperative held sway. Unlike <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/31/fred-goodwin-stripped-of-knighthood\" title=\"\">Fred Goodwin at Royal Bank of Scotland</a>, it did not take months of political pressure to make him succumb. If the banking industry is to regain public and political trust, it needs to mimic Crosby and find a moral conscience.</p>",

Of the \u20ac23bn total cost of the bailout (\u20ac6bn more than was agreed less than a month ago, by the way), Cyprus is expected to find \u20ac13bn from its own resources. That means as well as the privatisations, public sector layoffs and tax rises that have become familiar from the Greek case, Cyprus will have to sell off a large chunk of its gold reserves, and depositors in the collapsed Laiki bank with more than \u20ac100,000 in savings are likely to find themselves completely wiped out. There are even rumours the bank may not open on Monday morning. Yet, also in a familiar pattern, the calculations on which the rescue is based are still too optimistic: the country is expected to bounce back within a couple of years, despite a collapsed banking industry. Tourism, the country's other main business, will hardly have been enhanced by coverage of shuttered banks and riots. In Dublin this weekend, eurozone finance ministers promised Cyprus \"structural funds,\" to help rebuild its economy. But with the banking bust exacerbated by the bungled bailout, it's not clear what exactly they are planning to rebuild. And despite euro-politicians' repeated insistence that the island should not be seen as a \"template\" for future rescues, the raid on bank balances will mean any renewed whiff of crisis in Spain or Italy will send investors fleeing to the safer haven of Germany \u2013 or out of the eurozone altogether. The collateral damage to the whole eurozone banking system may prove far costlier than the bailout. Meanwhile hotel and restaurant-owners may be looking longingly across at the Turkish-occupied half of their island, which can offer a cheap lira and no chance of being stopped at the border and forced to hand over your holiday money. Pressure to leave the euro can only intensify. Let us applaud HBOS's Crosby \u2013 for having a conscience There has been an absence of morality, and of a reckoning, in the aftermath of the British banking crash \u2013 until recent weeks. The report into HBOS by the parliamentary commission on banking standards has provided the catharsis, adding empirical clarity to a public anger that has raged without a focal point since 2008. The subsequent statement by former chief executive Sir James Crosby is also one of the first genuine acts of atonement to emerge from that era. He was not legally obliged to ask for the retraction of his knighthood, or give up 30% of his pension, but the moral imperative held sway. Unlike Fred Goodwin at Royal Bank of Scotland, it did not take months of political pressure to make him succumb. If the banking industry is to regain public and political trust, it needs to mimic Crosby and find a moral conscience.",

      "bodyText": "A City worker catching an early train on 14 September 2007 from Edinburgh to London via Newcastle, home of the head office of a certain bank, would have passed the three great sites of British financial mismanagement even before the era-defining run on Northern Rock began that day. It's not purely coincidental that as the crisis grew and taxpayers' billions rescued Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, the banker's route would also become a bailed-out railway line. Just a month earlier, a new private operator, National Express, had won the right to operate the east coast mainline service with an eyebrow-raising bid, widely seen as the kind of overloaded punt businessmen and bankers were fond of taking at the time. Anticipating demand that would never appear as a new economic reality bit, by 2009 National Express East Coast had collapsed under the weight of its \u00a31.4bn offer \u2013 following in the footsteps of the previous incumbent, GNER, which had reneged on a \u00a31.3bn contract. Like RBS, Lloyds and Northern Rock, the east coast line was nationalised. Now the franchise, after its spell in the hands of East Coast, a subsidiary of the government's holding company Directly Operated Railways (DOR), is to be returned to the private sector. Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin prioritised an auction of the line in the new franchising timetable drawn up after the west coast fiasco. This week, one of the leading contenders for the route, Sir Richard Branson, spoke of the \"hunger\" that his Virgin group could bring to the route after what he called the \"stagnation\" of the past three-and-a-half years. Buoyed by recent confirmation that Virgin Trains will operate the west coast route until 2017, he said: \"We can absolutely do an awful lot better than the current management team on the east coast. The east coast has stagnated. The feedback we get is that passengers would like to see a change. We have years of experience in building companies, how to get people working for us really motivated and steamed up.\" Despite the east coast route's steady progress in public ownership, Branson told the Guardian in stark terms: \"If you just work for the government you don't get people hungrily trying to make a real difference.\" But a Thatcherite zeal for privatisation aside \u2013 he now owns Northern Rock as well \u2013 the Virgin tycoon is too canny to confirm he would match the premiums paid to the Treasury by DOR. After all, he has twice before been outbid for the line. In the past three years, DOR's east-coast operation has returned more than \u00a3600m to the government. This is more in real terms, DOR points out, than any other previous franchisee. If the issue of state versus private comes down to how much it costs to subsidise the nation's railways, the case for public ownership of the east coast is surprisingly strong. Instead, Branson argued that Virgin would provide \"massively\" better value to taxpayers overall through a combination of investment and premiums. \"We'd want to invest considerably in improving the track, trains, and speed times.\" Passenger numbers \u2013 and therefore revenue \u2013 could be driven up, Branson believes. City analysts agree there is scope for growth, particularly if Britain's wider fortunes pick up. But Douglas McNeill, investment director at stockbroker Charles Stanley, counsels: \"A long-distance franchise like East Coast is more subject to economic fluctuations than commuter services. There's more discretionary business and leisure traffic. And National Express bet on a level of passenger growth that did not materialise.\" So is it realistic to believe now that a private operator could deliver a better service for a lower cost, making profits for shareholders and still paying premiums to a government which has promised to cut state support for the railways? Branson has consistently argued that his rivals overbid unrealistically for the east coast, and the financial records bear out a history of operators trying to squeeze out more than the line could bear. The three sets of accounts filed at Companies House setting out the performance of the nationalised east coast mainline provide a stark insight into what the state inherited from the first private operators. The maiden accounts for DOR for the nine months to March 2010 paint a picture of a business which was suffering from underperformance and underinvestment. \"For long-term sustainable health, a business turnaround is required,\" the directors said. Train performance was a worry, but the engineering organisation was the biggest concern. \"There has been a prolonged period of underinvestment and support.\" In 2011's report they expanded: \"Safety performance had been deteriorating. There was a poor safety culture in the business.\" The latest report suggests the east coast franchise has improved under state ownership by almost every measure. \"The lack of investment has been reversed and, as a consequence, this has started to translate into improved performance.\" That performance covered safety standards and a more engaged, stable and committed workforce. And punctuality and customer satisfaction scores, measured by the Passenger Focus survey, were at record levels for the line. Yet directors recognised that there are still significant issues to be addressed. The 936 miles of track have had nothing like the money spent by Network Rail on the west coast mainline, a transformative \u00a39bn state investment. Branson's Virgin Trains \u2013 the main long-distance operator on the west coast \u2013 has benefited as a consequence, taking home \u00a3382m in dividends over 10 years, shared with co-owner Stagecoach. On the east coast line, severe delays have again hit the service in recent weeks with overhead line failures, making a mockery of last year's punctuality scores. In fact, only one operator fares worse on current annual average punctuality: Virgin. And while East Coast argues that 80% of delays occur as a result of external factors, the need to overhaul its ageing train fleet is an imminent, serious problem. The latest East Coast accounts underline the challenge that a private operator faces if it assumes control of the line. That company must match DOR's payment profile, help fund an overhaul of the infrastructure and the trains, and generate a decent profit for its shareholders. In the 28 months to 31 March 2012, the last period for which accounts have been published, the east-coast line generated more than \u00a31.5bn of turnover for DOR. In the same period, combined retained profits were just \u00a310m. With net assets of just \u00a37m, DOR has the hallmarks of a thriving not-for-profit business, not a successful private business. A significant turnaround has been executed at no cost to the government, which had received financial premiums of \u00a3416m by 2012, a figure East Coast says will total \u00a3640m when the latest accounts are filed. The business is in better shape, makes unprecedented returns for the state and remains in the black. But this is a business which is hungry for continued investment \u2013 and one with significant direct costs. The wage bill is \u00a3115m a year, it has annual lease commitments of \u00a3140m and must pay a financial premium to government of approaching \u00a3200m. At the same time, there is a pension deficit of nearly \u00a390m to be funded. For all that, Branson is unlikely to be the only private-sector investor who believes, despite previous failures, that there is still plenty to be squeezed out of the network by increasing passenger numbers. His 49% partner in the Virgin Rail group, Stagecoach, is reticent about bidding for the east coast again but Branson believes both the private sector and the taxpayer can benefit. He points to a tripling of passenger numbers on Virgin Trains' west coast services over the past decade: \"The subsidies the government had to put in were enormous. Now the government is the net beneficiary.\" The broader context was, of course, that the \u00a39bn west-coast upgrade was underwritten by the taxpayer, not Virgin. Yet Jim Steer, of transport consultancy Steer Davies Gleave, says that whoever picked up the tab, credit has to be given to Virgin for turning around the west coast. \"It doubled the number of intercity trains coming out of Euston and can point to having brought in radically different and challenging new trains, the Pendolinos, so it does have a track record.\" Steer warns that increasing capacity is complex, especially at the southern end of the eastern route and, he points out: \"Unlike on the west, the train's just not fast enough to compete with the airlines.\" Yet returning the east coast line to any operator who promises to ramp up passenger numbers raises a wider question about investment. Branson talks of building new track \u2013 money that would, of course, again ultimately come from the public purse. The boom in rail travel has also forced the case for high-speed rail on capacity grounds. The \u00a333bn bill is, the government says, a necessary price to pay before space runs out on the west coast main line. If Branson or any private operator is to end the alleged stagnation on the east coast line, the taxpayer will be called upon again.",

      "bodyText": "As crisis-weary finance ministers and central bank governors from around the world kick back in Washington this week, on the sidelines of the twice-yearly International Monetary Fund meetings, they could be excused for feeling a tinge of optimism in the spring sunshine. In the US, the bombed-out housing market is bouncing back; the stock market has hit fresh all-time highs; and there are hints that the Federal Reserve is starting to think about slowing the pace of its drastic quantitative easing programme. The latest data on consumer spending last week raised questions about how solid the recovery is \u2013 but there is hope. Japan's experiment with its radical new policy of Abenomics \u2013 the attack on deflation launched by new prime minister Shinzo Abe \u2013 may be in its early stages, but at least the country's new policymakers have a plan. And even in the eurozone, where keeping the single currency afloat still demands relentless wrangling, the mood of imminent crisis has abated since the bailout with Cyprus was agreed. But in a scene-setting speech in New York last week, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde stressed the deep divisions that remain in what she described as a \"three-speed\" global economy. Lagarde placed emerging economies at the front of the pack, ahead of a middling group \u2013 including the US \u2013 that has begun to rebuild its battered economies; while Japan and Europe were trailing behind. She also warned that the world's biggest banks remained a menace to financial stability, particularly in recession-hit Europe. Some of these differences, between the leaders and the laggards, are likely to surface in the talks this week among the IMF's 188 member countries, as central banks fret about their \"exit strategy\" from the emergency policies they have used to try to stimulate demand since the Great Recession. A chapter of the IMF's latest financial stability report, released to coincide with the build-up to the meetings, warns that long periods with ultra-low interest rates and so-called \"unconventional\" monetary policy, such as quantitative easing, can spawn serious long-term problems, even if they succeed in boosting short-term growth. At home, \"zombie\" firms and households that would have gone bust can be propped up by super-cheap borrowing \u2013 only to face an even greater risk of collapse when interest rates finally go up. Meanwhile, some of the cheap money created in the US, Japan and the UK will leak overseas, as investors seek better returns elsewhere. Emerging economies in Asia and Latin America are increasingly concerned about speculative investment flows pumping up their currencies and inflating asset bubbles. \"Despite their positive short-term effects for banks, these central bank policies are associated with risks that are likely to increase the longer the policies are maintained,\" the IMF warned. Depreciation is another welcome by-product of the hyperactive central banks' policies, and there will also be a debate in Washington about the risks of a beggar-my-neighbour battle to create the cheapest currency. Even before Japan's dramatic expansion of its bond-buying programme, the sharp devaluation in the yen over the past six months had raised concerns in Europe that a strong euro will harm competitiveness. Danny Gabay, of City consultancy Fathom, said an appreciating euro would drive Europe's economies deeper into recession and put the region's fragile banks at greater risk. \"Do they think the banking system that is already under stress from high unemployment and non-performing loans can withstand a stronger euro too?\" Face-to-face talks, like those that take place at these IMF gatherings, can force policymakers to confront the consequences of their domestically motivated policies \u2013 but they are rarely persuaded to change their plans as a result. Sir Mervyn King, the outgoing Bank of England governor, is likely to repeat his frequently expressed fear that there remain deep, fundamental tensions in the world economy, between creditors and debtors, savers and spenders, which have never been tackled. As he put it in a speech in New York in December: \"The G20 in 2009 came together at the London Summit and agreed the easy part, which was stimulatory policies where every country could agree. But ... since then ... there has been no agreement on the need for working together to achieve some element of re-balancing the world economy.\" Instead of brokering such an agreement, which might involve creditor countries such as Germany and China agreeing to boost their demand, instead of relying solely on cutbacks in debtor countries to narrow the divide, the IMF has repeatedly been dragged into rubber-stamping botched bailouts and harsh austerity policies when tackling the eurozone sovereign debt crisis. The IMF is due to reform its governance, including giving emerging economies such as China a stronger voice, but so far its board members have been unable to agree firm proposals. Meanwhile, it will stand ready to intevene whenever the next domino falls in the crisis that began more than five years ago.",

      "body": "<p>As crisis-weary finance ministers and central bank governors from around the world kick back in Washington this week, on the sidelines of the twice-yearly International Monetary Fund meetings, they could be excused for feeling a tinge of optimism in the spring sunshine.</p> <p>In the US, the bombed-out housing market is bouncing back; the stock market has hit fresh all-time highs; and there are hints that the Federal Reserve is starting to think about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/apr/10/federal-reserve-minutes-qe-ben-bernanke\" title=\"\">slowing the pace of its drastic quantitative easing programme</a>. The latest data on consumer spending last week raised questions about how solid the recovery is \u2013 but there is hope.</p> <p>Japan's experiment with its radical new policy of Abenomics \u2013 the attack on deflation launched by new prime minister Shinzo Abe \u2013 may be in its early stages, but at least the country's new policymakers have a plan. And even in the eurozone, where keeping the single currency afloat still demands relentless wrangling, the mood of imminent crisis has abated since the bailout with Cyprus was agreed.</p> <p>But in <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2013/041013.htm\" title=\"\">a scene-setting speech</a> in New York last week, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde stressed the deep divisions that remain in what she described as a \"three-speed\" global economy.</p> <p>Lagarde placed emerging economies at the front of the pack, ahead of a middling group \u2013 including the US \u2013 that has begun to rebuild its battered economies; while Japan and Europe were trailing behind. She also warned that the world's biggest banks remained a menace to financial stability, particularly in recession-hit Europe.</p> <p>Some of these differences, between the leaders and the laggards, are likely to surface in the talks this week among the IMF's 188 member countries, as central banks fret about their \"exit strategy\" from the emergency policies they have used to try to stimulate demand since the Great Recession.</p> <p>A chapter of the IMF's latest financial stability report, released to coincide with the build-up to the meetings, warns that long periods with ultra-low interest rates and so-called \"unconventional\" monetary policy, such as quantitative easing, can spawn serious long-term problems, even if they succeed in boosting short-term growth.</p> <p>At home, \"zombie\" firms and households that would have gone bust can be propped up by super-cheap borrowing \u2013 only to face an even greater risk of collapse when interest rates finally go up.</p> <p>Meanwhile, some of the cheap money created in the US, Japan and the UK will leak overseas, as investors seek better returns elsewhere. Emerging economies in Asia and Latin America are increasingly concerned about speculative investment flows pumping up their currencies and inflating asset bubbles.</p> <p>\"Despite their positive short-term effects for banks, these central bank policies are associated with risks that are likely to increase the longer the policies are maintained,\" the IMF warned.</p> <p>Depreciation is another welcome by-product of the hyperactive central banks' policies, and there will also be a debate in Washington about the risks of a beggar-my-neighbour battle to create the cheapest currency.</p> <p>Even before Japan's dramatic expansion of its bond-buying programme, the sharp devaluation in the yen over the past six months had raised concerns in Europe that a strong euro will harm competitiveness.</p> <p>Danny Gabay, of City consultancy Fathom, said an appreciating euro would drive Europe's economies deeper into recession and put the region's fragile banks at greater risk. \"Do they think the banking system that is already under stress from high unemployment and non-performing loans can withstand a stronger euro too?\"</p> <p>Face-to-face talks, like those that take place at these IMF gatherings, can force policymakers to confront the consequences of their domestically motivated policies \u2013 but they are rarely persuaded to change their plans as a result. Sir Mervyn King, the outgoing Bank of England governor, is likely to repeat his frequently expressed fear that there remain deep, fundamental tensions in the world economy, between creditors and debtors, savers and spenders, which have never been tackled.</p> <p>As he put it in a speech in New York in December: \"The G20 in 2009 came together at the London Summit and agreed the easy part, which was stimulatory policies where every country could agree. But ... since then ... there has been no agreement on the need for working together to achieve some element of re-balancing the world economy.\"</p> <p>Instead of brokering such an agreement, which might involve creditor countries such as Germany and China agreeing to boost their demand, instead of relying solely on cutbacks in debtor countries to narrow the divide, the IMF has repeatedly been dragged into rubber-stamping botched bailouts and harsh austerity policies when tackling the eurozone sovereign debt crisis.</p> <p>The IMF is due to reform its governance, including giving emerging economies such as China a stronger voice, but so far its board members have been unable to agree firm proposals. Meanwhile, it will stand ready to intevene whenever the next domino falls in the crisis that began more than five years ago.</p>",

Or an everyday devalue, as its marketing slogan almost puts it. Slim pickings for headhunters Anybody who's ever been interviewed by a City headhunter will almost certainly have been asked the standard questions: \"Where do you see yourself in the future?\"; \"What are your strengths?\"; and \"Do you have any weaknesses?\" (Wrong answer: \"I'm told I'm a bit of a perfectionist\"). Candidates without nicely honed responses to these perennial favourites tend to find their applications consigned to the filing cabinet, but this week that will be reversed as headhunting firms search for replies to similar queries from investors.

Persimmon man dismounts Persimmon was a top racehorse best known as a) the 1896 Derby winner b) a star of the future Edward VII's stables and c) the nag that gave its name to a house builder. While the racing original also went on to co-produce a quadruple classic winner, the builder's offspring have not always been in that thoroughbred class, having spawned a string of homogenous housing estates as well as, potentially, a shareholder revolt. A controversial \"golden goodbye\" likely to be worth more than \u00a34m to Mike Farley, the builder's departing chief executive, looks set to prove one of the early flashpoints of the annual meeting season this week. Farley is riding off with his winnings after a pay scheme was pushed through by the board last year \u2013 even though 15% of shareholders opposed it and the company stressed that the long-term incentive plan (LTIP) only paid out after large cash returns to investors. Yet in January Farley announced that he was ignoring the LT bit of the LTIP. He's to dismount on Thursday at the annual shareholder meeting \u2013 fittingly to be held at York racecourse. This has upset action groups and investors in the firm \u2013 whose equine inspiration spent his retirement in stud. Farley now looks set for a similarly gratifying retirement.",

      "bodyText": "Poor Sir James Crosby \u2013 as we must still call him, despite his wish to be plain mister \u2013 must now get by on a pension of just \u00a3406,000, after conceding last week that he should bear his share of the responsibility for the collapse of HBOS. His outbreak of humility, following the strongly worded report by the parliamentary commission on banking standards into the bailed-out bank's demise, was another step towards the public catharsis Britain has so far failed to achieve in the wake of the financial meltdown of 2008-09. Andrew Tyrie's commission, which boasts former chancellor Lord Lawson and no lesser figure than the Archbishop of Canterbury among its members, has done great work in peeling back the layers of self-justification and myth-making that had allowed some of the key protagonists in Britain's catastrophic banking crisis to insist that their consciences were clear. But the danger of such clear-cut historical analysis is that it consigns the recklessness and risk that brought down HBOS to the past. In a thought-provoking new book, The Bankers' New Clothes, described by the FT's Martin Wolf as the most important to emerge from the crisis, Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig make the heretical argument that banks are holding far too little capital, and this makes a fresh financial crisis is all but inevitable. One former Labour cabinet minister remarked wistfully after Crosby's climbdown last week that it was rather a shame, because while HBOS chairman Lord Stevenson, HBOS's chairman, who was also castigated by the committee, had never given much impression of being a banking expert, Crosby \"really seemed to know what he was talking about\". Labour heavyweights were far from alone in being taken in. The mystique of the money men, with their mathematical models and beautifully tailored suits, convinced everyone, including their own regulators, that they knew what they were doing. Today, they are busy modelling another suit of what Admati and Hellwig call \"new clothes\" \u2013 this time the idea that they can't possibly raise new capital from their shareholders without threatening to bring the fledgling economic recovery to a halt. Most fundamentally, the authors insist that boosting capital levels need not curb lending. Because capital is new funding, raised from shareholders or by reinvesting a bank's profits, it doesn't have to sit idle in a vault, but can be lent out. The question of how much lending to do is a separate one. Since the start of the credit crisis, we've all been forced to think hard about the ways in which banks are different from other businesses, not least because of the damaging knock-on effects of a banking collapse on the rest of the economy, and on taxpayers. But Admati and Hellwig insist that they're also fundamentally similar to other firms (and indeed homeowners), in a key sense: the more equity they have, the safer they become. Banks overwhelmingly fund themselves with debt, with borrowing levels far higher than most shareholders would consider prudent for other firms. That's for a patchwork of reasons, not least the fact that banks' creditors assume they will be bailed out in the event of a collapse, so are willing to lend to them cheaply. But just as a widget-maker, or a homeowner, would be considered dangerously leveraged if they had equity in their company or their home worth just 3-4% of its total value, banks' heavy dependence on debt makes them extremely vulnerable to even small fluctuations in the value of their assets, however sophisticated their risk models. That thin sliver of shareholders' capital is wiped out all too easily. Admati and Hellwig argue that capital levels should routinely be much higher \u2013 perhaps 20% to 30% of banks' total funding, instead of less than 5%. If, they say, a bank is unable to raise new capital \u2013 by retaining profits or by issuing new shares at any price \u2013 it would be a market signal that it was at risk of insolvency, and should be carefully dismantled, instead of kept alive by artificially cheap debt. For the UK, where even after the crash the financial industry is cherished, that would be a very bold upending of the long-held logic \u2013 accepted by George Osborne when he watered down the Vickers report proposals on banks' leverage levels \u2013 that forcing banks to build up capital is tantamount to telling them not to lend. But it should also embolden the Bank of England's financial policy committee, which has been widely criticised for asking the banks to find an extra \u00a325bn; and the commission for banking standards \u2013 which has already scored a considerable achievement in persuading the chancellor to \"electrify\" the ringfence between banks' investment banking and high street operations. Admati and Hellwig argue powerfully that if banks' funding model looks shaky, that's because it is. There is growing evidence that, outside the Treasury at least, policymakers are starting to think more radically too. The Bank of England's Andy Haldane has suggested that a clear, simple rule forcing banks to hold more capital might be more powerful and effective than the internationally agreed Basel III framework, with its fearsomely complex \"risk-weightings\" for different investments. As Haldane put it in a characteristically metaphor-rich speech last week, \"thin-slicing reform, whether regulation or tax, condemns us to failure. Peeling the onion one layer at a time tends to end in tears. It is only by removing all of the old layers that the painter and decorator can achieve a robust finish.\" Bankers and politicians have plenty of reasons for maintaining the status quo that has prevailed since the crisis, but Tyrie should not be afraid to get out the paint-stripper.",
