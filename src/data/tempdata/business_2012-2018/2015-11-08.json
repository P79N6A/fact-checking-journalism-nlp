      "bodyText": "Nordea, the \u20ac190bn (\u00a3135.6bn) Scandinavian fund manager, has become the first major investor to signal it is preparing to sue Volkswagen over the carmaker\u2019s manipulation of emissions tests. Nordea Asset Management told reporters over the weekend that it planned to join \u201cseveral different class actions\u201d against Volkswagen. The emissions fixing scandal has left investors with billions of euros of losses. VW\u2019s supervisory board is due to meet on Monday for the first time in a month, with the meeting chaired by new chief executive Matthias M\u00fcller, according to Reuters. The board includes a representative for the state of Lower Saxony, which holds a 20% stake in VW, as well as labour representatives and members of the founding Pi\u00ebch and Porsche families. It is expected to assess the fallout from the deepening scandal. VW\u2019s share prices has plummeted almost 40% since the company admitted in mid-September to US regulators that it had installed software in 11m diesel vehicles which could cheat nitrogen oxide emissions tests. A few days after the scandal broke, Stockholm-based Nordea banned its fund managers from making investments in VW for the next six months. It held half a million VW shares, worth more than \u20ac80m prior to the scandal, but has since offloaded the vast majority. Sasja Beslik, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management, told the Guardian: \u201cAs responsible investors we have the obligation to protect the interests of our beneficiaries and take measures that correspond with that responsibility.\u201d He said no final decision had been taken on legal action. The crisis widened dramatically last week when Porsche, owned by VW, became involved and VW admitted \u201cirregularities\u201d in the levels of carbon dioxide emitted by 800,000 cars sold mainly in Europe. This means that it could have to repay billions of pounds in tax to European governments. Germany\u2019s Bild am Sonntag reported that several VW engineers had admitted manipulating carbon dioxide emissions data because goals set by former chief executive Martin Winterkorn were hard to achieve. Winterkorn declared at the Geneva auto show in March 2012 that VW would reduce its CO2 emissions by 30% by 2015. Engineers did not dare tell him that this would be difficult to achieve, according to Bild. It reported that VW engineers manipulated tyre pressure and mixed diesel with motor oil to make cars use less fuel, a practice that began in 2013 and carried on until spring of this year. Volkswagen\u2019s UK sales fell by almost 10% after the emissions rigging scandal, according to industry figures, while other carmakers also posted steep declines. In south Korea, VW sales nearly halved in October from a year earlier.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The first 180 homes planned for inside the BBC\u2019s former headquarters \u2013 a curving 1950s building in White City, London, familiar to generations of television watchers \u2013 have been snapped up, mainly by UK buyers. The apartments were so popular that more were put up for sale than planned over the past two months. A further 270 homes will go on sale in April. Prices start at \u00a3650,000 for a one-bedroom flat but they will not be ready to move into until the end of 2017. Nearly half the planned 950 Television Centre homes will be inside the building, which when viewed from the air is shaped like a question mark. The central circular area, known as the \u201cdonut\u201d, is listed and has featured in decades of BBC programmes. Also well-known to viewers are the \u201catomic dot\u201d wall and the reception, popularly known as the stage door. Five penthouses at the top of the building are on sale, priced at up to \u00a37m. They will be next to a Soho House rooftop pool and bar, overlooking a public cafe-lined piazza the size of Trafalgar Square at the front of the building. Two office towers and 38 townhouses, which are expected to be priced at \u00a31.2m\u2013\u00a31.65m, as well as two affordable housing blocks, are also in the works. The 142 affordable homes will go on sale at 25% of the market value at a later stage. The new owners of the 14-acre BBC campus, the London developer Stanhope, Japan\u2019s Mitsui Fudosan and Canada\u2019s Alberta Investment Management Corporation, were careful to market the apartments to UK buyers first \u2013 who bought about 150 \u2013 before going on an overseas tour to Hong Kong and Singapore. There are mounting concerns that much of London\u2019s prime property is being snapped up by overseas investors, with the \u201cbuy to leave\u201d phenomenon turning swaths of west London into a ghost town at night. The Television Centre revamp is part of a wider, \u00a37bn construction frenzy at White City, where 5,000 new homes along with hundreds of offices and shops are being built. A further 24,000 new homes, along with a Crossrail-HS2 interchange station, are planned for Old Oak Common, north of the White City area. Westfield is building a four-level John Lewis store at its shopping centre in White City alongside 1,500 new homes. Developer St James is building a similar number of homes and Imperial College is constructing a new White City campus. Many of those looking for an affordable home, however, will be disappointed. As with elsewhere in London, only a small proportion of the new homes will be classed as affordable. Campaigners argue that the White City revamp will do little to mitigate the nationwide housing crisis, which will halve the number of young homeowners by 2020, according to the housing charity Shelter. Analysis of recent official figures found that the typical UK home (\u00a3284,000) costs more than 10 times the annual average income of full-time workers (\u00a327,000). Investment bank UBS has judged that house prices in London are the most overvalued of any major city in the world and are in \u201cbubble-risk territory\u201d. Stanhope insists that its prices are still lower than in many other west London areas, such as Notting Hill. Affordable housing makes up 15% of the total at Television Centre. One housing campaigner said: \u201cThat\u2019s actually quite a high number compared to other schemes.\u201d Shelter is calling for a return to the 50% affordable housing target for new developments in London, a goal that was in place until 2008. Its chief executive, Campbell Robb, says: \u201cWe have seen the rules watered down so that developers are let off the hook when it comes to building genuinely affordable homes. \u201cThe mayor and the government need to work together and reinstate clear rules for developers on affordable house-building. If they don\u2019t, ordinary Londoners face being priced out of the city altogether.\u201d Darren Johnson, who represents the Green party in the London assembly, would also like to see a return to the 50% target for affordable housing. \u201cThat target was never achieved, but it was an aim. The majority should be social rent. The numbers we are seeing in White City are clearly inadequate.\u201d The White City Residents\u2019 Association has welcomed the arrival of new homes and 19,000 jobs, which are desperately needed. The 1930s White City Estate, home to about 5,000 people, is one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the country. The association\u2019s chair, Harry Audley, says: \u201cThere\u2019s an incredible pressure on housing in this area. When I moved here 18 years ago, houses were just about affordable in terms of renting and buying.\u201d Today, an annual income of at least \u00a360,000 is needed to buy a home in the area, Audley says \u2013 while the average income is about half that. \u201cGiven that this is an area of low incomes ... people generally think that\u2019s a mockery.\u201d Nearly a third of local residents earn less than \u00a320,000. But, Audley adds: \u201cSome developers like Stanhope have made it clear that they are here for the long haul and want to contribute to the community. That doesn\u2019t mean to say that they put in 50% affordable housing, but it does give us room for discussion.\u201d Stanhope and Mitsui Fudosan have also bought the BBC\u2019s sprawling Media Village complex in White City and plan to turn it into a big office park, in the hope of luring creative companies from Soho with lower rents. At Television Centre, the BBC has leased a fifth of the site, including three of the original eight studios, dressing rooms and offices for its commercial arm, BBC Worldwide. Across the road, Imperial College is creating a 10-hectare (25-acre) technology and research campus that will straddle both sides of the A40. Westfield has embarked on a \u00a31bn expansion of its shopping centre that is expected to turn it into Europe\u2019s biggest mall. Westfield Shepherds Bush wants to snatch the title from Avia Park in Moscowand will have 2.6m sq ft of retail space. Next door, Berkeley Group\u2019s St James division will start building 1,465 homes on a former Marks &amp; Spencer warehouse site next summer, set around a four-acre public park. Here, 279 affordable homes will make up a fifth of the total, and the developer is paying \u00a333.5m to the council to fund another 163 social rented homes. Alicia Weston, a housing analyst at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, contrasts the fate of two neighbouring councils in a big city outside London. One of them struggles to get 10% affordable housing in new schemes, while the other routinely gets 30-40%. The first one does not have a clear decision-making process and officials give in quite easily to developers, she says, while the second one makes clear upfront that developers will not get planning permission if they don\u2019t meet the affordable housing target. \u201cIt\u2019s about who blinks first.\u201d But, she admits, things are trickier in the capital. \u201cYou have to do the best you can given that land prices are so ridiculously high.\u201d But even in London some councils, such as Islington, are getting higher proportions of affordable housing than others, she notes. Hammersmith and Fulham council says it has \u201cmade a valiant attempt to increase the amount of affordable housing in the current schemes. Each development is different and we look to maximise all opportunities to provide homes for local residents, not overseas investors.\u201d It has renegotiated several property deals and secured more than \u00a350m in extra funds that will be spent on 231 new affordable homes.",

The first one does not have a clear decision-making process and officials give in quite easily to developers, she says, while the second one makes clear upfront that developers will not get planning permission if they don\u2019t meet the affordable housing target. \u201cIt\u2019s about who blinks first.\u201d</p> <p>But, she admits, things are trickier in the capital. \u201cYou have to do the best you can given that land prices are so ridiculously high.\u201d But even in London some councils, such as Islington, are getting higher proportions of affordable housing than others, she notes.</p> <p>Hammersmith and Fulham council says it has \u201cmade a valiant attempt to increase the amount of affordable housing in the current schemes. Each development is different and we look to maximise all opportunities to provide homes for local residents, not overseas investors.\u201d It has renegotiated several property deals and secured more than \u00a350m in extra funds that will be spent on 231 new affordable homes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Senior TalkTalk staff were warned as early as 2013 that fraudsters were accessing customers\u2019 personal details \u2013 two years before the company fell victim to an external cyber-attack. As further TalkTalk fraud victims came forward this week \u2013 one losing almost \u00a310,000 \u2013 it has emerged that a manager in the chief executive\u2019s office was warned of a suspected data breach in July 2013, more than a year before the first evidence emerged that part of the firm\u2019s database had been leaked. Customer Keith Aldridge switched phone and broadband to the company in 2013, but within days he was called by a fraudster on the new landline number. The caller said he was ringing from TalkTalk and quoted details of his account \u2013 data that he claims \u201conly someone working for the telecoms firm would have had access to\u201d. Aldridge lost \u00a3110 as a result of the scam, but TalkTalk\u2019s head office later told him it would be inappropriate for the company to investigate the possible breach as it was a police matter, he claims. TalkTalk said there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that a problem in 2013 was ignored, and has refused to pay compensation. It argues that Aldrige must have provided additional personal or financial details to the scammers for the fraud to take place. Fourteen months after Aldridge was targeted by fraudsters, TalkTalk suffered the first of series of data breaches, culminating in the most catastrophic breach last month. About a dozen people are each thought to have lost several thousand pounds after being called by fraudsters who were able to convince their victims that they worked for TalkTalk. This week, three further victims emerged, including a Manchester nurse who has lost \u00a39,600 after being contacted by fraudsters purporting to be from TalkTalk just days before the company revealed the latest cyber-attack. Thomas Catherall was quoted all his account details and promised a \u00a3250 refund. His computer was taken over remotely and two payments were taken out of his bank account. His bank, Santander, has refused to refund him \u2013 as it has other victims\u2013 on the basis that he was tricked into handing over security codes. TalkTalk has repeatedly refused to accept any liability for its customers\u2019 losses. But fraud victims planning to bring a class action against the telecoms firm have claimed that they were not properly warned that their personal data was in the hands of fraudsters after the 2014 breach, and therefore they should be compensated. Any evidence that the company was aware its data had got into the hands of criminals as early as 2013 could strengthen their case. Aldridge said he switched to TalkTalk in the summer of 2013 but almost immediately suffered technical problems. \u201cThe fraudsters called me on my brand new landline, on a new number that I had been given as part of the switch. It was so new that I had only passed it on to two family members, and yet the fraudsters had that number \u2013 and knew all about the technical problems I had had,\u201d he claims. Like other victims he was promised a \u00a350 goodwill payment to apologise for the problems he experienced after the fraudsters used his bank card to make a Western Union payment for \u00a3109. While his bank, the Co-op, refunded the money, Aldridge was so concerned at what had happened that he contacted the TalkTalk CEO\u2019s office to outline his concerns. \u201cIn my view the company did not address it in anything approaching an adequate manner. Perhaps if they had done so there might not have been these newer issues,\u201d he said. Two teenagers and a man in his 20s have been arrested in connection with the most recent alleged data theft from TalkTalk. Almost 157,000 TalkTalk customers had their personal details hacked in last month\u2019s cyber-attack. TalkTalk said the total number of customers affected by the attack two weeks ago was 156,959, including 15,656 whose bank account numbers and sort codes were hacked. The total is 4% of TalkTalk\u2019s 4 million customers and is a small fraction of the number feared when news of the attack broke. In a statement, TalkTalk said: \u201cWe\u2019re sorry that Mr Catherall and Mr Aldridge have been targeted by criminals. Sadly, telephone scams are a growing problem for all companies, not just TalkTalk. That\u2019s why we continue to advise customers to be vigilant and we have put measures in place to help our customers stay safe. \u201cWe have written to all our customers to warn them about phone and email scams and provided a list of information we will never ask customers to provide over the telephone. We\u2019ve also set up an online advice page, and customers can report suspicious calls by calling 0800 0832710. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that scam telephone calls and emails have been going on for years and continue to be a growing issue. Just a few weeks ago research from the Money Advice Service showed that around eight scam calls are placed every second from fraudsters purporting to be from the likes of banks, utilities companies and even HMRC.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The court is in session. The jury has been chosen and the public gallery is packed. The clerk has sworn in the first witness and the trial in Kilkenny\u2019s courtroom No 2 is ready to begin. This, though, is a tribunal with a difference. It is not an individual in the dock but economics. The event is part of the Kilkenomics festival, four days in which economists, financial experts and media commentators are asked questions by Ireland\u2019s standup comedians. Although it sounds a bit weird, the concept works \u2013 not least because the comedians pull the economists up if they start to talk in jargon. The idea is to demystify economics and turn it into Davos with jokes. There is laughter in the courtroom when the comedian Karl Spain asks the jury: \u201cHave any of you ever been hurt by economists in the past?\u201d. The quip is well-aimed. It is a lot of fun. This year, the main attraction was Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister. His appearance highlighted the fact that while the eurozone crisis has disappeared from the headlines, the underlying issues remain unresolved. Greece is being turned from a developed nation to a developing nation. It was a shame that Varoufakis left before the trial of economics, since he would have been an excellent witness. In the case of Greece, economics is guilty as charged. The point was made by Heiner Flassbeck, who is unusual in that he is a German economist who thinks his country is the problem rather than an example to be followed by the rest of Europe. \u201cGermany is to blame,\u201d Flassbeck tells the court. \u201cGermany got it wrong from the beginning of monetary union because it tried to live below its means.\u201d Asked to explain, Flassbeck says that after the German monetary union deflated domestic demand, wages didn\u2019t keep pace with inflation so living standards fell. Companies couldn\u2019t sell at home and investment was weak, but fortunately there was a safety valve: countries such as China were industrialising fast and wanted the high-quality manufacturing goods that were Germany\u2019s speciality. Countries in the rest of Europe struggled to match the improvement in Germany\u2019s productivity. The circle could only be squared by Germany reinvesting the profits it was making on its exports. This took the form of capital flows from Germany to the weaker countries of southern Europe, which became heavily indebted and vulnerable to the financial crash that came along in 2007. At that point, one solution would have been for the Germans to help the rest of Europe through a modern form of the Marshall Plan, a four year postwar financial commitment by the US to rebuild the economies of countries devastated by war. But Angela Merkel, with the support of other countries in northern and eastern Europe, did not do that. Instead, Berlin decided that the solution was to export the German model to Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland. The economics behind this was that wage cuts and less generous welfare would reduce the price of labour. Economics textbooks say that if you reduce the price of something the demand for it will go up. But demand for labour in Greece and Portugal did not go up: it dropped alarmingly. Why? Simple, says Flassbeck: what\u2019s true of the market for potatoes is not true of the market for labour. \u201cPotatoes do not buy other goods\u201d, he tells the court. \u201cIf you cut the price of people you cut their ability to buy other goods. It has been a disaster for the whole of Europe.\u201d No lessons have been learned from this catastrophe, according to Flassbeck. \u201cHaving tried it in Greece, Portugal and Spain, the Germans now say \u201clet\u2019s try it in France and Italy as well\u201d. The experience of the recent past proves Flassbeck\u2019s point. Another witness, Mart\u00edn Lousteau, was Argentina\u2019s youngest ever economics minister between 2007 and 2008, and explains to the court how his country escaped from its own death spiral in 2001. At the turn of the millennium, Argentina looked much like Greece today. It had tied the peso to the dollar in an attempt to sweat inflation out of the economy but the result had been a severe depression and rising debt. In early 2002, the crisis came to a head. Argentina abandoned the dollar peg and devalued. It said it would not pay its international creditors. It said that those members of the public who had taken out home loans in dollars could have them redenominated in pesos to make them affordable. Within five months, Lousteau notes, the economy was growing again. True, he says, Argentina is now back in trouble. It has 25% inflation, poor growth and a big budget deficit. But it is the politicians who are to blame for failing to learn the right lessons from the past. In the 1990s, he adds, the problem was that politicians listened too much to the economists; today the problem is that the warnings of economists have been ignored. There was much talk in 2008 and 2009 about how the near-death experience of the global financial system would lead to a new economics. This hasn\u2019t really happened yet, although events such as Kilkenny suggest there are plenty of people yearning for a different way of doing things. Richard Murphy, who has been the source of many of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s economic policies, including \u201cpeople\u2019s QE\u201d\u2013 the creation of money to pay for infrastructure projects \u2013 is a big draw. Stephanie Kelton, economic adviser to Bernie Sanders, who is challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination in the US presidential race, tells the mock trial that capitalism has to work for more than just the top 1% of earners. Improvement in the economy is not filtering down, she says, and the anger is manifesting itself in the popularity both of Sanders and Donald Trump. In a sense, there are two problems. One is that economics in the years leading up to the crash was dry, mathematical, irrelevant and wrong. The second is that politicians have been slow to pick up on the ideas of economists who have challenged the orthodoxy. They have instead have tried to return to business as usual. It is not just economics that needs to prove its relevance, but politics as well. Both have a legitimacy problem. So here\u2019s a question. If, as seems almost inevitable, the shock treatment for Greece fails, what happens next? Will there be calls for still more self-defeating austerity or will somebody stand up to Germany and say enough is enough? Flassbeck says there is a need in Europe for people bold enough to stand up to Germany. \u201cMy fear is that it will be Marie Le Pen who will do it.\u201d",

Simple, says Flassbeck: what\u2019s true of the market for potatoes is not true of the market for labour. \u201cPotatoes do not buy other goods\u201d, he tells the court. \u201cIf you cut the price of people you cut their ability to buy other goods. It has been a disaster for the whole of Europe.\u201d</p> <p>No lessons have been learned from this catastrophe, according to Flassbeck. \u201cHaving tried it in Greece, Portugal and Spain, the Germans now say \u201clet\u2019s try it in France and Italy as well\u201d.</p> <p>The experience of the recent past proves Flassbeck\u2019s point. Another witness, Mart\u00edn Lousteau, was Argentina\u2019s youngest ever economics minister between 2007 and 2008, and explains to the court how his country escaped from its own death spiral in 2001.</p> <p>At the turn of the millennium, Argentina looked much like Greece today. It had tied the peso to the dollar in an attempt to sweat inflation out of the economy but the result had been a severe depression and rising debt.</p> <p>In early 2002, the crisis came to a head. Argentina abandoned the dollar peg and devalued. It said it would not pay its international creditors. It said that those members of the public who had taken out home loans in dollars could have them redenominated in pesos to make them affordable. Within five months, Lousteau notes, the economy was growing again.</p> <p>True, he says, Argentina is now back in trouble. It has 25% inflation, poor growth and a big budget deficit. But it is the politicians who are to blame for failing to learn the right lessons from the past. In the 1990s, he adds, the problem was that politicians listened too much to the economists; today the problem is that the warnings of economists have been ignored.</p> <p>There was much talk in 2008 and 2009 about how the near-death experience of the global financial system would lead to a new economics. This hasn\u2019t really happened yet, although events such as Kilkenny suggest there are plenty of people yearning for a different way of doing things. </p> <p>Richard Murphy, who has been the source of many of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s economic policies, including \u201cpeople\u2019s QE\u201d\u2013 the creation of money to pay for infrastructure projects \u2013 is a big draw. Stephanie Kelton, economic adviser to Bernie Sanders, who is challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination in the US presidential race, tells the mock trial that capitalism has to work for more than just the top 1% of earners. Improvement in the economy is not filtering down, she says, and the anger is manifesting itself in the popularity both of Sanders and Donald Trump.</p> <p>In a sense, there are two problems. One is that economics in the years leading up to the crash was dry, mathematical, irrelevant and wrong. The second is that politicians have been slow to pick up on the ideas of economists who have challenged the orthodoxy. They have instead have tried to return to business as usual. It is not just economics that needs to prove its relevance, but politics as well. Both have a legitimacy problem. </p> <p>So here\u2019s a question. If, as seems almost inevitable, the shock treatment for Greece fails, what happens next? Will there be calls for still more self-defeating austerity or will somebody stand up to Germany and say enough is enough?</p> <p>Flassbeck says there is a need in Europe for people bold enough to stand up to Germany. \u201cMy fear is that it will be Marie Le Pen who will do it.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "As the Irish property market was in the early days of what would become a freefall in 2008, Damien Murtagh had an opportune idea. The architect, then working in Dublin, was used to making models using card and foamboard to show clients what their completed home would look like. However, the process typically took improvisation, with magnets from kitchen cabinets used to bring the scale structures to life. Many other architects had long since switched to solely showing their work via 3D computer imagery. Murtagh said: \u201cI thought [that] surely if you can make a model as quickly as you can draw it, architects will start making models again. If I could make it quick, affordable, reusable, there has to be a world out there that would want it.\u201d From those early thoughts emerged Arckit, a modelling kit that provides the doors, walls, supports and roof tiles to create scale-model houses. While the initial product was focused on architects, the popularity of the kits has now spread to hobbyists and children, prompting comparisons with Lego and Meccano. \u201cI like to say that it is a graduation from all of the building blocks you have ever played with,\u201d said Murtagh. \u201cI always knew that if I could simplify model making that it would open it up to everybody. It just means that you take away the glue, the cutting, the measuring, the sticking. You don\u2019t have to know about scale.\u201d The plastic kits include a selection of 26 different types of parts, which come together to make up the final home, from the joins that connect floorboards to the tiles that line the rooftop. The pieces are clicked together to take the form of the houses, which are 1:48 in scale to a full-sized building. Ideas are provided in an accompanying booklet. Using this basic selection of parts, two- and three-storey models, linked by stairwells, internal columns and corner windows, can be constructed. Packaged with the parts are blank adhesive sheets on which designs such as brick patterns can be printed, to bring colour to the constructions. Future plans include the option for users to design their own parts for the kits, which can then be 3D-printed to order. After launching last year, the kits\u2019 appeal extended beyond architects who may have wanted to use them alongside 3D on-screen renderings, said Murtagh. The Arckit boxes are placed beside Meccano on the shelves of Harrods in London. Arckit\u2019s place among other construction toys was confirmed when Barnes &amp; Noble stocked the product in 445 of its US stores. Four kits are available: the smallest is \u00a349.99, while a kit equivalent to 60 sq metres (650 sq ft) is \u00a389. One for 120 sq metres is \u00a3169 and a version equivalent to 240 sq metre is \u00a3269. Adding to demand is a generation of children who have grown up playing Minecraft, the computer game where players make constructions in a virtual world. Murtagh said: \u201cThere is this gap between all of these toy products and [something more advanced]. You had all of these toys but you had nothing done after that.\u201d Murtagh\u2019s family, who are from Cavan, Ireland, has a long history in the construction industry. His father, Eugene, was the founder of Kingspan, the listed-building materials group. The first Arckit box was sold at the Grand Designs show in London last year to a child who had played with an early test version the year before. Murtagh said: \u201cThis generation is incredible, what they are creating is staggering and I think [that] \u2014 like Lego inspired the architects of today \u2014 Minecraft will inspire the architects of tomorrow, and I hope that Arckit will take part in that.\u201d Arckit has been use to recreate Big Ben and build spaceships and airports, which is all far from the intended scale models for architects. The construction toy market is a lucrative one to break into. It is one of the fastest-growing segments of the games industry and even outperforms video games, according to figures from Euromonitor International. From 2008 to 2013, toy sales were down 15% but the construction toy sector grew by 123%. In the US, Arckit has won an award for its educational benefits and for introducing children to architecture. Murtagh explained the four different-sized kits are tailored to the different groups - hobbyists, architects and children - using them. One of the primary aims for the kits was education, rather than for it to become the next mainstream toy product, he said. At \u00a3269, the largest kit could be above some parents\u2019 budgets. Murtagh argues, however, that it is a \u201cproduct for life\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is a quality reusable product that is a design tool. If you compare this to other products it is not really expensive.\u201d One of the scale houses that Murtagh has made to illustrate what can be achieved with the Arckit is a recreation of a Frank Lloyd Wright house in Pittsburgh. His own preference is for modern architecture and the kits are based on contemporary panel-building systems. While he initially divided his time between the Arckit project and designing real-life homes at his architecture practice in Teddington, south-west London, he says his sole focus is now on the rapidly growing new product. The future launch of an online shop for components will broaden out the range of pieces by 30, with users able to order individual parts. People will also be able to draw sketches of parts they want, such as a curved or coloured wall, and they will be designed and printed. \u201cIf you want to put a turret [on the house], you can 3D-print it,\u201d Murtagh said What is in the kit? The heavily stylised Arckit boxes give more of a nod to Apple design than traditional toy packaging. Inside there are selections of corner-wall joints, low walls, corner windows, roof panels, stairsand other components. The pieces click into each other and can be reused. A booklet offers ideas for modern-style buildings that can be made to scale. Bags of additional pieces can be bought to add to those included in one of the four kits.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s retailers are hanging out the tinsel and looking forward to a bumper Christmas, with unemployment down, living standards finally climbing and house prices on the rise. But if everything is set fair for a festive blowout, why does the Bank of England still think it\u2019s too soon to raise interest rates? Part of the answer is that, as governor Mark Carney made clear at his quarterly inflation report briefing last week, the shaky state of global economies, including China\u2019s, means they have to balance the strength of domestic demand against over headwinds from overseas. But it\u2019s more than that: the Bank is acutely conscious that the recovery remains fragile, unbalanced and vulnerable to external shocks. Four pieces of evidence. First, there has been precious little \u201cdeleveraging\u201d, or unwinding of debt, among Britain\u2019s households, many of which struggled to keep their heads above water in the lean years that followed the recession. Real wages have recently started to rise, and with luck they should continue to do so; but it will take a long time to unwind the after-effects of a protracted period during which consumers have turned to payday lenders in their droves, maxed out their credit cards and dipped deep into their overdrafts to make ends meet. As the Bank of England pointed out in its inflation report, the average household owes debts worth about 130% of a year\u2019s income. That\u2019s less alarming than the 150% peak before the crisis, but it still tells a story of fragility and stress: and it\u2019s a key reason the Bank has so far fought shy of raising interest rates from emergency levels. Second, the sheer size and openness of our financial sector means we tend to catch a heavy dose of any market contagion going. The assets of the UK\u2019s banking sector are worth four years\u2019 GDP, with \u201cnon-bank financial institutions\u201d such as insurers and fund managers worth as much again \u2013 making our financial sector far larger, relative to the rest of the economy, than any other major country bar Switzerland. As the Bank of England put it in its recent assessment of the economic impact of Brexit, \u201cgreater openness to the EU, like openness more generally, has probably increased the external challenges to UK monetary and financial stability, as seen in the recent euro-area crisis\u201d. There is no reason to think that would be any less true in a future crisis, whatever form it takes. Third, bubbles are a sure sign of economic fragility, and the housing market, particularly in London, is well into frothy territory. Prices nationwide are increasing at an annual rate of 10%, and the average property in the capital is now worth almost eight times the average income. That has dire social consequences, as the grim tales of first-time buyers queuing around the block to secure an affordable flat in Hounslow attest. But it has economic consequences too. Unaffordable housing silts up social mobility, exacerbates inequality and makes it hard for firms in expensive areas to hire the staff they need. But like any bubble, it is also inherently unstable, kept intact by cheap debt and confidence. Lower house prices would bring benefits; but an abrupt crash would be catastrophic, which is one of the reasons the Bank has so far used extreme caution in exercising its new \u201cmacroprudential\u201d powers to rein in the market. And fourth, our current account deficit with the rest of the world \u2013 often seen as one of the best indicators of whether a country can pay its way \u2013 stood at 5.1% of GDP last year, the highest level since records began in 1948. The reasons are complicated: as well as the trade balance, the current account deficit includes the returns we make on overseas investments \u2013 which have declined recently \u2013 compared with the returns earned by foreign investors in Britain. One potential explanation for this shift could be large-scale tax avoidance showing up as investment offshore, rather than a fundamental deterioration in our ability to make good returns abroad. That would be an indicator of a global tax system gone mad rather than economic weakness. But there\u2019s no easy way to explain away the stubborn persistence of the trade deficit, which was \u00a38.5bn in the latest quarter and will continue to drag on economic growth. Much of this pattern is depressingly familiar. In some ways the credit crisis may have changed everything, but as long ago as 2002, Mark Carney\u2019s predecessor-but-one, Eddie George, was already saying \u201ca two-speed economy is better than a no-speed economy\u201d \u2013 with a rampant services sector and buoyant consumer spending compensating for the weakness of manufacturing and trade. With luck, recent evidence that productivity is starting to pick up, validating rising wages, should continue to underpin living standards, helping to offset the impact of a fresh round of public spending cuts. But Carney and his colleagues are wise to be cautious. Gordon Brown\u2019s catchphrase, \u201cthe economic fundamentals are sound\u201d, soon looked absurd when the Lehman collapse exposed the lopsidedness of Britain\u2019s economy. And as Catherine Colebrook, chief economist at the Institute for Public Policy Research, puts it: \u201cSince the crisis, we haven\u2019t done enough to change what we produce and how we produce; and on a fundamental level, we still have the same vulnerabilities that we had five or 10 years ago.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "More than four decades have passed since strikers at Ford\u2019s Dagenham plant helped usher in the Equal Pay Act. Yet, tomorrow, with eight weeks still to go until the end of the year, women in effect stop earning relative to their male counterparts. The point in the year campaigners have dubbed \u201cequal pay day\u201d is based on the 14.2% gap in average hourly pay between men and women working full-time. That gap is part of a much wider inequality problem in Britain\u2019s workplaces. Not only are women likely to earn tens of thousands of pounds less than male colleagues over a career, they will also face a tougher battle getting to the top. They are far more likely than men to work in low-paid part-time jobs. And when caring needs hit a family \u2013 be it for small children or ageing parents \u2013 women are still more likely than their male partners to cut their hours or give up work altogether to shoulder the load. Good news, then, that David Cameron has vowed to \u201cend the gender pay gap in a generation\u201d. Shortly after re-election he announced new rules forcing every company with more than 250 employees to publish the difference between the average pay of its male and female employees. There were also encouraging noises in two government-backed reports published over the last fortnight. The most recent looked at the UK\u2019s financial sector, where fewer women progress to senior levels than in any other industry. Leading the government-backed review, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money, recommended the bonuses of City executives be linked to hitting targets for the number of senior women appointed at a firm. That followed a report from Lord Mervyn Davies that showed FTSE 100 companies had exceeded the target of having 25% women on their boards \u2013 more than doubling their numbers from 2011, when the goal was set. Davies has now raised the bar, urging Britain\u2019s biggest companies to ensure that at least a third of board positions are held by women by the end of the decade. So he should. The rise in numbers of women on boards is welcome but started from a low base. Research by the Guardian this year showed there were more men called John running FTSE 100 companies than all the female bosses combined. There are plenty of other reasons campaigners will be pushing Cameron and colleagues to keep their word on equality. When and if women do make it to the top, against the odds, they tend to be paid far less than their male peers. New analysis being published by the TUC tomorrow will show that as people move up the pay scale, the gap between men and women widens. There is still widespread evidence, too, of pregnant women and new mothers being discriminated against by their employers. Employers are by no means alone in carrying the blame for entrenched stereotypes around the role of mothers. Parents themselves are guilty of outmoded thinking when it comes to deciding who cuts their work commitments to care for the children. In theory, shared parental leave, which came into force this year, should challenge the stereotype of the mother as the main carer. But in reality for most families it would not make financial sense to take advantage of the new rules. It\u2019s baby steps rather than social revolution. So will a generation be long enough? For the economy it simply has to be. More than half our graduates are women, and a country with such woeful productivity levels cannot afford to squander so much talent, training and education. But it will require more than reports and recommendations. Investors must lobby for more equality in companies, businesses themselves can fight discrimination, offer more flexibility and be transparent about pay. The government, meanwhile, must do more on childcare and to help fathers take parental leave. Only if action is taken on all fronts can we expect to stop marking equal pay day. Insular VW badly needs some independents The news last week that Volkswagen may have rigged carbon dioxide tests as well as those for diesel emissions is a disaster for the German company for two reasons. First, rigging CO2 tests resonates more with governments and motorists than the diesel scandal. CO2 effects the tax band that a vehicle sits in and its fuel consumption, so governments will be able to force the company to repay tax credits, and customers will ask for compensation for their fuel costs. Second, the discovery of another front in the scandal erodes the credibility of VW\u2019s investigation, its management, and the company\u2019s corporate governance. Matthias M\u00fcller, the new chief executive, was already stretching his credibility when he claimed that a handful of rogue engineers were behind the installation of defeat device software into 11m diesel cars. Now that we know VW may also have cheated other tests, this statement becomes even more unacceptable. Even if it was 10 to 20 rogue engineers who created the scandal, there is something deeply wrong in a company where this level of deception is allowed to foster or is not spotted. VW\u2019s statement revealing its concerns about the CO2 levels emitted by 800,000 cars was laughable. It had no detail about the models involved or how the irregularities occurred. It provided more questions than answers. The German carmaker sorely needs an independent and experienced voice at the top to help it through this crisis. The bosses of Britain\u2019s leading companies are criticised when they go awry, and rightly so. But the standards that FTSE 100 companies are held to should be applauded. The need for an independent chairman, a senior independent director, and the regular refreshing of boards means management is held to account and is connected with the outside world. VW gives the impression that it is insular. Its board is full of local government ministers and members of the Pi\u00ebch and Porsche family. The works council is represented, while the chairman is the former finance director. The company should take a leaf out of Britain\u2019s book and bring some outsiders on to its board. Cyber-attack puts TalkTalk\u2019s targets out of reach Is embattled TalkTalk chief executive Dido Harding about to set a record for the fastest abandonment of a core financial target? It was only in May that she upgraded the phone firm\u2019s revenue targets. The last quarter had seen record growth and she thought TalkTalk could run at 5% every year to 2017 and beyond. After the cyber-attack suffered by the company a fortnight ago, few in the City think it can be done. On Friday the group said the impact was \u201cless than feared\u201d but the damage to the brand will be hard to shake off. Indeed, think of Harding\u2019s reign as a five-year attempt to shed TalkTalk\u2019s reputation for poor customer service. Until the hack, she seemed to be winning; hard to say so now. Chairman and founder Sir Charles Dunstone\u2019s thoughts would be good to know: since the optimism in May, the value of his 30% stake has fallen by \u00a3450m.",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s imports fell by nearly a tenth in October from a year ago, official data showed on Sunday, underlining weakening domestic demand in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The slowdown in China\u2019s economic expansion has sent jitters across global stock markets and was cited in September by US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen as a reason for delaying the long-expected rise interest rates. But although the weak trade figures may again cast doubt on the chances of a rate rise in December, one of her colleagues has called for the Fed to start the so-called \u201clift-off\u201d after keeping raising rates at near zero for seven years. \u201cMy forecast is that we\u2019ll reach our maximum employment mandate in the near future and I\u2019m increasingly confident that inflation will gradually move back to our 2% goal,\u201d San Francisco Federal Reserve bank president John Williams said in a speech in Arizona. \u201cIt makes sense, therefore, to start gradually moving away from the extraordinary stimulus that got us here,\u201d added Williams, who was Yellen\u2019s chief researcher when she had his job before moving to Washington. Traders boosted their bets on such a move after a US government report on Friday showed the economy added many more jobs than expected in October, sending the jobless rate down to 5%, close to or at full employment. But the latest figures from China could make them think again. Imports fell 9.8% to $130.77bn in October, the 12th consecutive monthly drop in imports, following a 20.4% decrease in September. Exports, too, continued their losing streak from July, dropping by 6.4% year-on-year in October to $192.41bn as foreign demand languished, according to figures from the general administration of customs. Purchases of raw materials such as crude oil and soybeans went up in quantity, but China paid far less for the goods than a year ago because of lower prices. However, China cut back on purchases of coal, steel, copper and aluminum, in a sign of sluggish economy. Coal imports, for example, have dropped almost 30% on volume and 40% on value over the first ten months of the year, the data showed. The October trade surplus rose to $61.64bn, driven by the continued drop in imports, the data showed, suggesting that the Asian giant continues to struggle with improving domestic demand. It was also bad news for resource-rich countries such as Australia and Brazil for whom the world\u2019s biggest trader country is a crucial client. China\u2019s sluggish property market, overcapacity in the manufacturing sector and slowed government spending in infrastructure have contributed to the country\u2019s economic slowdown and contribute to decreasing demand for such commodities as coal and iron ore, used in heavy industry. Beijing aims to rebalance the economy to a sustainable model where expansion is predominantly driven by domestic consumer demand, but the transition is proving bumpy. Botched stock exchange interventions and a sudden currency devaluation in August have rattled confidence in the country\u2019s leadership, whose legitimacy rests on maintaining an aura of economic infallibility. Last week, Chinese equities entered a bull market, with the Shanghai Composite Index rising over 20% since the end of August, a hopeful signal that investor confidence is on the upswing and could drive increasing consumer confidence. Chinese president Xi Jinping this month said annual expansion should be no less than 6.5% in 2016-2020 if the country is to double GDP and incomes compared to 2010 levels by the end of the decade. The comments are the clearest indication yet that Beijing will reduce its target growth rate from the current \u201caround seven percent\u201d, after expansion slowed in the July-September period to 6.9 percent, its slowest pace in six years.",
