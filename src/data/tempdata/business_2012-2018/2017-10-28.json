While companies refuse to invest and Whitehall is paralysed by Brexit, why not legislate and nationalise to get something done? Britain is in the midst of an investment crisis, a productivity crisis, an income crisis and an inequality crisis \u2013 and all are so entrenched that they are beyond policies that tinker or No 10\u2019s \u201cnudge unit\u201d. Nudge economics, despite the award this year of a Nobel prize to its main proponent, the American Richard Thaler, is a pathetically weak tool given the scale of the problem. What\u2019s more, so many of the government\u2019s current policies, nudge or otherwise, are just plain bad. A case in point is the \u00a310bn allocated to the help to buy programme, which is a rare example of big money being thrown at a situation, in this case the one affecting housebuilding. Help to buy works by giving homebuyers an interest-free government loan worth up to 20% of the value of a new-build property. It was designed by the Treasury and backed by the Bank of England as a way to spur housebuilding across the country. But a report by Morgan Stanley has found that almost all of the \u00a310bn has gone into the pockets of housebuildding firms, with little evidence that the rate of housebuilding has increased. Shares in the big building companies have soared, as you might imagine, and the promise of \u00a310bn more from Philip Hammond in next month\u2019s budget has of sent their market values even higher. A year ago, the price of a share in Persimmon, the UK\u2019s second-largest housebuilder, stood at \u00a316. Now it stands just below \u00a329, a 55% rise. And this obsession with private property goes deeper, as the IPPR Commission on Social Justice found in its report \u2013 Financing investment: Reforming Finance Markets for the Long Term. The commission is a cross-party group that includes business people \u2013 who run airports, departments stores and investment funds \u2013 alongside figures from civil society such as Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, members of charity Citizens UK and a smattering of academics. It\u2019s not only the government that is obsessed with lending to prop up property owners and developers \u2013 the banking sector is keen, too. The report sets out the way UK banks mostly lend abroad, with loans to UK businesses accounting for just 5% of total UK bank assets, compared with 11% in France, 12% in Germany and 14% on average across the rest of the eurozone. Property loans to businesses and individuals in the UK account for more than 78% of all loans to individuals and non-financial businesses \u2013 which means those outside the Square Mile. After stripping out real estate, loans to UK businesses account for just 3% of all banking assets. As a transmission mechanism for diverting the nation\u2019s savings into worthwhile, productive businesses, the banks fail miserably. And the rest of the financial sector is just as bad. The IPPR report accused hedge funds, proprietary traders (which use investment bank cash) and high-frequency traders \u2013 a group that collectively makes up 72% of trades in on the London market \u2013 of paying themselves depending on performance against rivals and over short timescales, \u201cnot long-term value creation\u201d. This spivvy trading arena has the knock-on effect of making short-term demands on the boards of listed companies. Such is the pressure to avoid being caught in traders\u2019 headlights that in a survey of more than 400 executives, some 75% said they \u201cwould sacrifice positive economic outcomes\u201d if it helped smooth their profit figures from one quarter to the next. The report argues that this self-absorbed world of stock market trading needs to support longer-term investment in a way that also benefits savers and business owners. Some of the solutions it puts forward are all well worth pursuing, including a move to scrap the little-known \u201cmarket maker\u201d relief on stamp duty reserve tax. This would effectively be a first step towards a financial transactions tax to reduce short-term speculative trading, while also raising at least \u00a31.2bn a year by 2020. The commission goes on to say that the funds raised should be used to introduce new reliefs in capital gains tax and corporation tax to encourage the longer-term ownership of shares. Yet, that \u00a31.2bn qualifies as not much more than a nudge in the right direction. It won\u2019t satisfy those who demand that a leftist government should go beyond encouragement and nationalise the commanding heights of the economy, from the energy companies to the railway franchise holders, and tackle the banking sector by funding new investment vehicles, national and regional, to bridge the gap between high finance and small and medium-sized businesses. Labour already has many of these policies in its manifesto, and some at the top of the party plan to go further. Fortune favours the brave, they say. Could it be though, that while the commission appears timid, its aim of achieving a broad consensus for policy initiatives means it has a better chance of long-term success? It is frustratingly accurate when it portrays Britain\u2019s economy as a supertanker. Hoping it will react like a dinghy to a hard push on the tiller is wishful thinking.",

      "bodyText": "Markets have a tendency to panic when central banks threaten to raise interest rates. In 2014, the US Federal Reserve and its then boss, Ben Bernanke, sent traders across the world into a spin when he merely hinted that the era of almost zero rates might be ending. It\u2019s been a decade since the Bank of England last increased the cost of borrowing, so it is no surprise that this week\u2019s vote by the monetary policy committee, which Threadneedle Street has sketched out as a good moment for a rise, is being closely watched. Nine committee members hold the key to unlocking 10 years of ultra-low rates \u2013 with five drawn from the Bank\u2019s payroll and four external members from industry and the City. The latter serve a three-year stint, which is often extended to six years. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is among many on the MPC to have hinted that 2 November will be the day the Bank should at least reverse its emergency 0.25% set in August 2016, which was designed to ensure that the economy did not take a dive in the wake of the Brexit vote. And having listened to one carefully coded hint after another in recent months from what is clearly a majority of members, markets have judged that an increase is now almost nailed on \u2013 with a 90% probability. However, the case for a rate rise, as Carney and his colleagues always stress, is finely balanced and could go either way once they have sieved through all the economic data. Here we consider the arguments for raising them versus the reasons to hold steady. The case for higher rates The Bank of England was set two targets when it was reconstituted by Gordon Brown in the late 1990s and granted the power to set interest rates independently: to maintain inflation at around 2% and to make sure that monetary policy kept the economy\u2019s wheels turning. In the past 10 years these have proved to be conflicting aims, because to raise rates has been seen as an almost certain way to kill off growth. That wouldn\u2019t be the case in more normal times, but in the aftermath of the banking crash, with lenders initially strapped for funds and regulators concerned to keep the financial sector on a tight rein, low interest rates were seen as the only way to keep money flowing around the economy. And that is especially true when so much household spending is based on borrowed money. So the second concern \u2013 to keep GDP expanding \u2013 has won out over the imperative to maintain inflation steady at 2%, and inflation has been allowed to soar to 5% \u2013 as it did in 2012, when the Bank sat firmly on its hands and did nothing. Forecasts for inflation don\u2019t show it going back to 2012 levels, but with a rate of 3% recorded in September and predictions of rises for at least the next couple of months, the Bank must consider increasing the cost of borrowing to reduce the demand for goods and services, and calm price rises. Further price increases could already be in the pipeline, according to some MPC members, following the fall in unemployment to 4.3% in the three months to August. As Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, says, the joblessness rate is at its lowest since 1975 and well below the 4.5% equilibrium rate the Bank believes determines full employment and is the trigger for higher wages. With more money in their pockets, workers could be tempted to borrow and spend even more, adding to the pressure on prices. It\u2019s not just jobs: the economy has held up much better than most forecasters, including the Bank, predicted following the Brexit vote. It has grown throughout the year \u2013 when many thought it could fall into recession \u2013 after three previous years of growth. If the Bank won\u2019t raise rates against this backdrop, then when? Some economists also believe the bank should take the opportunity to raise rates now because it may need to cut them again the future. At 0.25%, the bank has no real leeway for a cut that would act as a stimulus. By raising rates \u2013 maybe once, maybe more \u2013 Threadneedle Street starts to rebuild its ammunition for use in a crisis. And then there is the question of pride. This is a huge factor after months during which the Bank has prepared the ground for a rate rise. As Archer says: \u201cIf it fails again to follow through with a rate hike, it will risk losing credibility.\u201d It would also probably prompt a fall in the pound \u2013 which would stoke inflation even further. Carney\u2019s reputation as a modern-day Grand Old Duke of York is under particular scrutiny. He has used speeches and reports in the past to tell businesses and households that higher borrowing costs are imminent \u2013 only to retreat back down the mountain. It could be that his influence will wane should he refuse to make good on yet another threat. The case for the status quo The economy may have grown for almost four straight years, but the rate of growth has declined since its initial burst in late 2013 and is now the lowest of all major economies. Next year, the OECD says Italy and Japan, often derided as the zombie economies of the developed world, will grow faster than the UK. Last week the Office for National Statistics said Britain grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of the year, compared with 0.3% in the first two quarters. The MPC\u2019s newest recruit, Sir David Ramsden, formerly the Treasury\u2019s chief economic adviser, said in his confirmation hearing that given rates of growth almost half what they were in 2015, the economy was too weak to withstand higher borrowing costs. With the government seeking to cut back on borrowing, and large corporations hoarding enough cash to avoid the need to borrow, driving up the cost of loans to consumers and small businesses could push the economy further towards zero growth. Brexit is another reason to err on the side of caution and keep rates where they are. Consumers have already become more circumspect with their spending. High street surveys show consumers keeping their wallets shut unless there is a good reason to open them. The CBI\u2019s latest figures showed the steepest fall in retail spending since the depths of the post-banking crisis recession in 2009. High street bellwethers John Lewis and Debenhams have both warned of challenging trading. Car sales have already plummeted, as have sales of furniture. According to the Halifax, confidence in the housing market is at a five-year low. Chris Williamson of economics consultancy IHS Insight says the \u201cslow erosion of growth\u201d may continue. He points out that across all sectors of the economy, inflows of new business in September were at their lowest for 13 months, suggesting that demand for goods and services \u201chas waned again\u201d. Business optimism is weak, he adds, which is another indication that businesses are about to suffer a further drop in activity and that the economy will slow \u201ctowards stagnation at best\u201d. Archer of the EY Item Club believes inflation is set to fall back markedly from around the turn of the year as the impact of past sharp falls in sterling fade. The weak pound has seen many businesses suffering a large rise in import costs, which a number have absorbed through lower profit margins and passed on to workers through sub-inflation wage rises. Nevertheless, prices have crept up. Without further falls in sterling, prices will stabilise on their own. An interest rate rise in this situation could make a bad situation worse. It\u2019s a danger Ramsden has been explicit about wanting to avoid. But pushing an already struggling economy, dogged by Brexit-related uncertainty, towards recession is not something any MPC member will want to be remembered for. Where the MPC stands Gertjan Vlieghe External member A former hedge fund economist, Vlieghe, an external member of the MPC, said in August: \u201cThis is an environment where a premature hike would be a bigger mistake than one that turns out to be slightly late.\u201d Last month he said the mood was changing: \u201cThe appropriate time for a rise in bank rate may be as early as in the coming months.\u201d How hawkish? 8/10 Silvana Tenreyro External member A former professor at the London School of Economics, Tenreyro is a new appointee. At her first public engagement last month, she said: \u201cWe are approaching a tipping point when we will need to reduce some of that stimulus.\u201d She added that unemployment still needed to be lower: \u201cA premature increase might be very contractionary, so a mistake there might be very costly.\u201d How hawkish? 6 Michael Saunders External member Former Citibank economist Saunders voted for a rise in September, to dampen looming price pressures. In August he said: \u201cOur foot no longer needs to be quite so firmly on the accelerator in my view. A modest rise in rates would help ensure a sustainable return of inflation to target.\u201d How hawkish? 10 Ian McCafferty External member The former chief economic adviser at the CBI voted in July to raise the base rate from 0.25% to 0.5%. He has voted for a rise ever since, arguing that the \u201cpick-up in inflation is not something we can just ignore\u201d, especially when the \u201chealthy performance of businesses in the past year shows the UK economy could cope with higher interest rates\u201d. How hawkish? 10 Andrew Haldane Chief economist Haldane was once a fervent supporter of low interest rates, but in the summer hinted that he was more inclined to start pushing them higher. In June, he said a partial withdrawal of the emergency post-Brexit package of an interest rate cut and an extra \u00a360bn of quantitative easing \u201cwould be prudent relatively soon\u201d. How hawkish? 6 David Ramsden Deputy governor In charge of markets and banking, the former Treasury economist says slowing growth and declining real wages mean now is not the time for a rate rise. He said last month: \u201cDespite continued robust growth in employment, there is no sign of second-round effects [demands for higher pay] on to wages from higher recent inflation.\u201d How hawkish? 2 Jon Cunliffe Deputy governor In charge of financial stability at the Bank, Cunliffe is one of the committee\u2019s most risk- averse members. Last month he told the Western Mail that the UK economy had \u201cclearly slowed\u201d, and that any rate rises would be gradual. As he put it: \u201cThe exact timing of when that starts? Well, that for me is a more open question.\u201d How hawkish? 4 Ben Broadbent Deputy governor Responsible for monetary policy, Broadbent is a close confidant of Carney and keeps his cards close to his chest. In July he stressed the weakness of the economic outlook, saying: \u201cIt is a bit tricky at the moment to make a decision [to raise rates]. I am not ready to do it yet.\u201d How hawkish? 6 Mark Carney Governor Carney is expected to vote for a rise after saying in September that the \u201cpossibility has definitely increased\u201d. To give a little more context to his decision, he said: \u201cThe majority of committee members, myself included, see that that balancing act is beginning to shift, and that ... to return inflation to that 2% target in a sustainable manner, there may need to be some adjustment of interest rates.\u201d How hawkish? 6",

And that is especially true when so much household spending is based on borrowed money.</p> <p>So the second concern \u2013 to keep GDP expanding \u2013 has won out over the imperative to maintain inflation steady at 2%, and inflation has been allowed to soar to 5% \u2013 as it did in 2012, when the Bank sat firmly on its hands and did nothing.</p> <p>Forecasts for inflation don\u2019t show it going back to 2012 levels, but with a rate of 3% recorded in September and predictions of rises for at least the next couple of months, the Bank must consider increasing the cost of borrowing to reduce the demand for goods and services, and calm price rises.</p> <p>Further price increases could already be in the pipeline, according to some MPC members, following the fall in unemployment to 4.3% in the three months to August. As Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, says, the joblessness rate is at its lowest since 1975 and well below the 4.5% equilibrium rate the Bank believes determines full employment and is the trigger for higher wages. With more money in their pockets, workers could be tempted to borrow and spend even more, adding to the pressure on prices.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just jobs: the economy has held up much better than most forecasters, including the Bank, predicted following the Brexit vote. It has grown throughout the year \u2013 when many thought it could fall into recession \u2013 after three previous years of growth. If the Bank won\u2019t raise rates against this backdrop, then when?</p> <p>Some economists also believe the bank should take the opportunity to raise rates now because it may need to cut them again the future. At 0.25%, the bank has no real leeway for a cut that would act as a stimulus. By raising rates \u2013 maybe once, maybe more \u2013 Threadneedle Street starts to rebuild its ammunition for use in a crisis.</p> <p>And then there is the question of pride. This is a huge factor after months during which the Bank has prepared the ground for a rate rise. As Archer says: \u201cIf it fails again to follow through with a rate hike, it will risk losing credibility.\u201d</p> <p>It would also probably prompt a fall in the pound \u2013 which would stoke inflation even further.</p> <p>Carney\u2019s reputation as a modern-day Grand Old Duke of York is under particular scrutiny. He has used speeches and reports in the past to tell businesses and households that higher borrowing costs are imminent \u2013 only to retreat back down the mountain. It could be that his influence will wane should he refuse to make good on yet another threat.</p> <h2><strong>The case for the status quo</strong></h2> <p>The economy may have grown for almost four straight years, but the rate of growth has declined since its initial burst in late 2013 and is now the lowest of all major economies. Next year, the OECD says Italy and Japan, often derided as the zombie economies of the developed world, will grow faster than the UK.</p> <p>Last week the Office for National Statistics said Britain grew by 0.4% in the third quarter of the year, compared with 0.3% in the first two quarters.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Inflows of new business in September were at their lowest for 13 months, suggesting that demand has \"waned again\"'</p> <footer> <cite>Chris Williamson, IHS Insight</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The MPC\u2019s newest recruit, Sir David Ramsden, formerly the Treasury\u2019s chief economic adviser, said in his confirmation hearing that given rates of growth almost half what they were in 2015, the economy was too weak to withstand higher borrowing costs.</p> <p>With the government seeking to cut back on borrowing, and large corporations hoarding enough cash to avoid the need to borrow, driving up the cost of loans to consumers and small businesses could push the economy further towards zero growth.</p> <p>Brexit is another reason to err on the side of caution and keep rates where they are. Consumers have already become more circumspect with their spending. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/26/alarm-sounds-over-state-of-uk-high-street-as-sales-crash\" title=\"\">High street surveys show consumers keeping their wallets shut</a> unless there is a good reason to open them. The CBI\u2019s latest figures showed the steepest fall in retail spending since the depths of the post-banking crisis recession in 2009. High street bellwethers John Lewis and Debenhams have both warned of challenging trading. Car sales have already plummeted, as have sales of furniture. According to the Halifax, confidence in the housing market is at a five-year low.</p> <p>Chris Williamson of economics consultancy IHS Insight says the \u201cslow erosion of growth\u201d may continue. He points out that across all sectors of the economy, inflows of new business in September were at their lowest for 13 months, suggesting that demand for goods and services \u201chas waned again\u201d.</p> <p>Business optimism is weak, he adds, which is another indication that businesses are about to suffer a further drop in activity and that the economy will slow \u201ctowards stagnation at best\u201d.</p> <p>Archer of the EY Item Club believes inflation is set to fall back markedly from around the turn of the year as the impact of past sharp falls in sterling fade. The weak pound has seen many businesses suffering a large rise in import costs, which a number have absorbed through lower profit margins and passed on to workers through sub-inflation wage rises. Nevertheless, prices have crept up. Without further falls in sterling, prices will stabilise on their own. An interest rate rise in this situation could make a bad situation worse.</p> <p>It\u2019s a danger Ramsden has been explicit about wanting to avoid. But pushing an already struggling economy, dogged by Brexit-related uncertainty, towards recession is not something any MPC member will want to be remembered for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13a7f70e930946ff7ab7d4c15811948df996cbf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13a7f70e930946ff7ab7d4c15811948df996cbf9/0_336_3925_2355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is now expected to vote for a rate rise.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is now expected to vote for a rate rise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Where the MPC stands</h2> <p><strong>Gertjan Vlieghe</strong><br><strong>External member</strong><br>A former hedge fund economist, Vlieghe, an external member of the MPC, said in August: \u201cThis is an environment where a premature hike would be a bigger mistake than one that turns out to be slightly late.\u201d Last month he said the mood was changing: \u201cThe appropriate time for a rise in bank rate may be as early as in the coming months.\u201d <strong>How hawkish? 8/10</strong></p> <p>S<strong>ilvana Tenreyro</strong><br><strong>External member</strong><br>A former professor at the London School of Economics, Tenreyro is a new appointee.

But on Monday the suited and booted doormen will be opening the doors to some perhaps unexpected faces. The bank, which has served the Queen and every member of the royal family since George IV, is hosting a special event for a group of its next target clients: twentysomething video gamers. Peter Flavel, Coutts\u2019s chief executive, said talented eGamers and eSports players are now making so much money from games like League of Legends, Dota 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive that they require the services of the private bank to help manage their new-found fortunes. \u201cAs the economy evolves and people are creating wealth in new ways, it\u2019s important that we\u2019re at the forefront,\u201d says Flavel, a 57-year-old Australian who joined Coutts as chief executive last year. \u201cIncreasingly younger people are making money in electronic games and vlogging [video blogging].\u201d When asked how many people were making enough money from gaming to make it worthwhile for Coutts, which is part of majority state-owned RBS and demands prospective customers have at least \u00a31m in investable assets, Flavel said: \u201cIt\u2019s large enough for me to be talking to you. It\u2019s not in the handful of clients.\u201d ESports have broken out of teenage bedrooms to sports arenas across the world, where tens of thousands of fans watch the best players compete for multi-million pound prizes. The players of Team Liquid shared $10.8m (\u00a38.25m) of prize money for winning the International DOTA 2 Championships in Seattle this summer. Total prize money for the championship of the five against five multiplayer fantasy game was $24m. Tickets to watch the final against team Newbee at the 17,500-seat KeyArena stadium cost $200 each, and more than 5 million watched the battle online. Team Liquid\u2019s 24-year-old captain Kuro \u201cKuroky\u201d Takhasomi is the world\u2019s number one player and highest earning eGamer, according to E-sports Earnings, with career winnings of $3.4m. The Iranian-German eSports pro has played in 74 tournaments and won six so far this year. As well as prize money eGamers also make handsome returns from sponsorship and marketing deals. More than 600 players have signed sponsorship deals since 2016, according to research by Nielsen. Global eSports revenue is expected to reach $696m in 2017, an increase of 41% on 2016, according to eSports market intelligence firm Newzoo. It estimates that 385 million either play or watch eSports, and expect the number to grow to almost 600 million by 2020. Goldman Sachs reckons that the eSports industry will be worth more than $1bn within three years as it develops into professional sports teams with leagues, franchises, sponsors and fans. Almost 100 eGamers and YouTubers \u2013 some of whom are in their early 20s, have signed up for Coutts accounts, and the bank hopes a similar number of prospective clients will turn up to its eGaming event on Monday. Flavel said the bank would treat eGamers similarly to its other professional sports clients, including some of the world\u2019s most famous footballers, golfers and Formula One racing drivers. \u201cMuch like footballers, we\u2019ll lend to them for six-to-seven year terms, because that\u2019s the average [professional] life of a footballer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important for people new to wealth to think through how long [their] income stream will be there for. \u201cThese games tend to have short half-lives. So we need to help these young people think through the next 10 to 15 years, not the next one or two years.\u201d Flavel said the younger gamers would help in the bank\u2019s mission to become more \u201cmodern and contemporary\u201d while keeping its roots and traditions. The bank has a history of working with people in the arts, including famous actors and rock and pop stars, but most of its younger clients tend to come from wealthy families with longstanding ties to the institution. He said the bank holds regular events for the children of clients to explain to them the basics of finance and markets, and to help them meet each other and \u201ccreate a community\u201d of likeminded people to share advice and investment ideas. As well as meeting in Coutts\u2019s offices, younger clients are also encouraged to join an online portal called Coutts Connect. Flavel said, of Coutts customers: \u201cThey run from the landed estates and traditional clients through to those in the arts, media and entertainment.\u201d As well as sports stars, Flavel said Coutts is also the favoured bank of many of the partners of major City law and accountancy firms. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ve got the CEOs of the FTSE 100 [companies],\u201d he said. In total Coutts\u2019 customers hold \u00a358.8bn with the bank. About 85% of the clients of the bank are British, but Coutts also helps wealthy overseas investors conduct deals in the UK. Flavel describes a typical example as \u201cSomeone from the Middle East buying a hotel in Mayfair, living in a house in South Kensington with kids going off to public schools and then on to the elite universities.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A tatty car park under a railway line is squeezed between a busy road, an industrial site and a semi-derelict pub covered in graffiti. It\u2019s one of the grittiest parts of east London and probably the last place you would imagine some of the trendiest eateries in the country to be preparing meals. But the grimy spot is just a short moped ride from the gleaming office towers of Canary Wharf and upmarket docklands apartments, and is therefore the perfect location for the latest idea from Deliveroo, the food courier service. It is setting up dozens of \u201cdark kitchens\u201d in prefabricated structures for restaurants that want to expand their businesses without opening expensive high street premises. Ten metal boxes of a similar size to a shipping container are on this site in Blackwall. They are fitted with industrial kitchen equipment, and two or three chefs and kitchen porters are at work in each, preparing food for restaurants including the Thai chain Busaba Eathai, the US-style MeatLiquor diners, the Franco Manca pizza parlours and Motu, an Indian food specialist set up by the family behind Mayfair\u2019s Michelin-starred Gymkhana. The boxes have no windows and many of the chefs work with the doors open, through which they can be seen stirring huge pans or flipping burgers. Outside there are piles of spare equipment, mops in buckets, gas cylinders for the stoves and large cans of cooking oil. This is one of the biggest of 11 sites currently operated by Deliveroo that are home to 66 dark kitchens. Five sites use the metal structures, known as Rooboxes or Deliveroo Editions, while others are in adapted buildings. The majority are in London, but there are others in Leeds, Reading and Hove, tucked away in car parks or on industrial estates. All are close to residential and office areas filled with customers hungry for upmarket takeaways. The locations may be unglamorous, but one dark kitchen in Southwark, south London, is turning out rotisserie chicken for the pricey Notting Hill-based specialist Cocotte. There are also outposts for Gourmet Burger Kitchen, the trendy pizza joint Crust Bros and the Soho sushi bar Yoobi. Deliveroo has big ambitions for its Rooboxes, with plans to open more in London\u2019s Swiss Cottage, Nottingham and Cambridge soon, and Manchester and Birmingham lined up for more boxes next year. Deliveroo finds and equips the locations, then rents them out to the restaurants, which employ and train the kitchen staff. Two chefs tell the Guardian that working in the metal boxes is either hot or cold, depending on the weather and whether they are cooking or prepping. In one kitchen, there is only a small fan heater for cold days. Another houses a pizza oven that takes up more than a third of the space and makes it extremely hot. Javed Akhtar, the operations director of Franco Manca, says the company is testing out a Roobox at the Blackwall site so diners and chefs at its busy nearby restaurant can avoid being troubled by takeaway delivery drivers. Franco Manca chefs get extra money for working in the box, he says, because \u201cthere is no interaction with front-of-house staff\u201d. It also encourages chefs who may not be keen to work in a metal box in a car park. But more chefs are likely to soon be swapping central locations for less salubrious surroundings. Deliveroo\u2019s sales soared sevenfold to \u00a3128.6m last year as it expanded its operations in the UK and overseas, to 25,000 restaurants in more than 140 cities and 12 countries. The food delivery market, which includes the Deliveroo rivals JustEat and UberEats as well as traditional takeaways, is expected to increase by 10% a year to \u00a353bn by 2020, according to the market analyst NPD. But it is not all straightforward for Deliveroo. The company had planned to have more than 200 dark kitchens on 30 sites across the UK by the end of 2017, and even more overseas. That target has been missed and there have been complaints from residents and councils, who accuse the company of bypassing planning rules. The Roobox site in Camberwell, south London, may be forced to close after Southwark council said the noise of delivery vans and mopeds was a nuisance to neighbours and the operations had been set up without planning permission. Dan Warne, Deliveroo\u2019s UK and Ireland managing director, admits the company did not move quickly enough to speak to the council and residents in Southwark, but says Roobox kitchens are clean, hygienic and checked by the Food Standards Agency. He says Deliveroo is considering the use of more pushbikes to deliver food, rather than mopeds, in order to reduce noise where that is a problem. The company has a team of staff especially to deal with queries and complaints from councillors and residents. \u201cWe are keen to adapt our operations to meet the concerns that people raise,\u201d Warne says. \u201cWe do understand this is a new thing coming into an area and some people will have questions about it.\u201d Some residents living in and around Rooboxes say they welcome the opportunity for jobs for young people. But in Dulwich, south London, Pasquale Mereu, a chef at the nearby Italian restaurant Il Mirto, says Deliveroo has been a \u201cvery bad thing\u201d for the business. He says the restaurant\u2019s delivery orders have more than halved in the past year and they have had to lay off one of two couriers.",
