      "bodyText": "Strikes by butchers over the price of beef have led the Indonesian government to seek to import more cattle into the country, but Australian exporters are still awaiting confirmation on how the changes will affect them. Indonesian trade minister Rachmat Gobel has increased the number of permits for the importation of live cattle, Indonesian news outlets have reported, less than a month after Jakarta announced it would slash permits for Australia by 80% from 250,000 head of cattle to just 50,000 this quarter. It is unclear whether Indonesia will seek to increase imports from Australia, and whether it will take live cattle or boxed meat. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of speculation at the moment. We need to see the detail of the specifications,\u201d the chief executive of the Australian Livestock Exporters\u2019 Council, Alison Penfold, said. Jakarta has said it wants to move Indonesia towards food self-sufficiency, but the price of beef has remained high following the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ended in mid-July, due to the shortage in supply. \u201cButchers have been on strike because of the price,\u201d Penfold said. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly been a reaction from butchers.\u201d A spokesman for the Australian agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, said he is \u201cencouraged\u201d by news that more permits will be released. \u201cWhile this is a matter for the Indonesian government, the Australian government\u2019s continued engagement with Indonesia and advocacy for our livestock export industry has highlighted the benefits of a good relationship and an open trading environment for both countries,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIf confirmed, this will be good news for our producers and exporters who will have more options about where to sell their quality livestock.\u201d Penfold said the request for more imports in Indonesia proves that the two countries need to issue permits on an annual basis, rather than the current quarterly basis. \u201cWe\u2019re not a \u2018turn the tap on and off\u2019 industry,\u201d she said, adding that it can take years for cattle to become ready for export. The Australian government is concerned about the uncertainty the current system creates for Australian exporters, the spokesman for Joyce said. \u201cFluctuating quota levels create uncertainty that in turn creates additional costs which are passed on to Indonesian consumers and industry, leading to higher food prices,\u201d he said. Joyce announced a new live-cattle deal with China in late July, after warning that Australia would need to look beyond Indonesia to grow its live export industry.",

The bank was warned in June it could face penalties from the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England, which are preparing to announce their findings on Tuesday. At the time, the bank said it would begin settlement talks with the two regulators in July, sparking expectations it could face a fine for the events that led to it needing an emergency cash injection in 2013. As a result of the cash call, the Co-op Group\u2019s stake in its once important banking arm fell to 20% after hedge funds stepped in to fill the funding void. Sky News has reported that the regulators have concluded a large fine could undermine the capital position of the Co-op bank. The bank, the Bank of England and the FCA refused to comment. In June, the bank said: \u201cThe FCA and PRA [Prudential Regulation Authority] have indicated that their preliminary view is they are minded to make findings against the bank covering certain decisions, events and processes over the period from mid-2008 to end-2013. Based on their current view, the FCA and PRA have indicated they intend to commence formal settlement discussions in July 2015.\u201d The regulators have powers to fine, reprimand and ban firms and individuals, although the Bank of England\u2019s PRA has rarely used its powers. The first bank to be fined by the PRA was the Royal Bank of Scotland, in November for its IT failures in June 2012. The near collapse of the Co-op bank unleashed a row about the way it had been regulated and hit a political nerve about the role of the major parties in promoting co-operatives, with the bank seen as having had the backing of politicians to expand. The government has promised an independent inquiry. There was also scrutiny of those at the top of the bank at the time of the debacle, particularly of Paul Flowers, who was the chairman and a methodist minister. Flowers was unable to tell the Treasury select committee the size of the bank\u2019s balance sheet and later pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine at Leeds magistrates court after an expos\u00e9 by the Mail on Sunday.",

    "webTitle": "Berkeley's supercharged share payout makes Sir Martin Sorrell's look modest", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell eat your heart out. The boss of WPP attracts flak every year when he collects the winnings from his supercharged incentive scheme, but they almost look modest when set against the financial prizes accumulating at Berkeley Group, the company that builds one in 10 new homes in London. Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman, got \u00a320m worth of shares in April from a long-term scheme created in 2009, yesterday\u2019s annual report revealed; the same scheme is virtually nailed on to pay out similarly next year. But these distributions (actually worth \u00a325m now because of the subsequent jump in the share price) are appetisers. The main course is the 2011-21 scheme, which already looks likely to generate what could be the biggest payout to the board of a UK public company. Pidgley and his managing director Rob Perrins each have 5m options under the 2011 scheme; three other directors have a combined 5.1m shares. That 15.1m collection is potentially worth \u00a3528m at the current share price of \u00a335, or \u00a3400m if one deducts the value of dividends that must be paid to hit the jackpot. The key point is that Berkeley directors have cleared the first dividend hurdle on the way to a full payout and are odds-on to jump the other two, especially now that the Conservative party\u2019s general election victory in May has killed talk of a mansion tax. As the annual report said: \u201cThe board considers that the group is well positioned to meet the remaining milestones of 433p by September 2018 and 433p by September 2021.\u201d A 10-year scheme is long and, viewed through the lens of the 2011 property market, the targets would have looked tough. Berkeley, in effect, was aiming to return its entire market capitalisation, or \u00a31.7bn, to investors via dividends within a decade. Shareholders thus approved an arrangement whereby 13% of Berkeley\u2019s equity could be handed to the directors as a bonus. Yet the thick end of half a billion quid shared between five individuals would be an extraordinary landmark in the rise of boardroom pay in the UK. Sums became life-changing long ago, but this could be another league. Pidgley, it might be argued, is a unique individual whose ability to read the property market is essential to Berkeley\u2019s success \u2013 similar arguments are made to justify Sorrell\u2019s rewards. Yet, in Berkeley\u2019s case, we are talking about mega-sums being collected by an entire board. Divisional director Sean Ellis, for example, is on course for a \u00a360m payday at the current share price. Berkeley is an unusual company, certainly, and not all housebuilders have trebled their share prices since 2011, despite George Osborne\u2019s many housing-friendly measures. But the precedent here can\u2019t be good. Directors everywhere, under pressure to lengthen their long-term incentive schemes, will draw a straightforward conclusion: if they have to wait longer for their prizes, they will want their potential jackpots to be bigger \u2013 much bigger. Berkeley will be exhibit A as they make that demand. A textbook acquisition for Warren Buffett Precision Castparts is a typical Warren Buffett deal \u2013 it\u2019s an industrial company with a long history and a well-entrenched position in a big market, namely components for airplanes. \u201cWith few exceptions, every aircraft in the sky flies with parts made by Precision,\u201d the company can claim. The timing also follows the familiar textbook. Buffett is buying after the share price has fallen from its highs, in this case because of weakness in the oil and gas markets, which Precision also supplies. So far, so predictable. But, at $32.5bn, Buffett is paying 19 times his earnings for a company whose profits have gone roughly sideways for the past two years. The great man, naturally, is more interested in the next two decades. If his analysis is that the number of planes in the air will only increase, he may be vindicated. Even so, this is not a straightforward bargain. Berkshire\u2019s biggest deal probably won\u2019t be its best. That\u2019s the problem of being so huge already. Esure looking unsure Some two years after arriving on the stock market, Esure is still almost a fifth below its flotation price. Car insurance, it seems, is a rough market \u2013 lots of whiplash claims and intense pressure on premiums. Underlying profits fell 21% to \u00a346.5m in the first half. \u201cThe management team continue to act in a disciplined manner in challenging market conditions,\u201d says its founder and chairman, Peter Wood. Translation: we are going to lose market share by putting up prices but we have to do it anyway. It\u2019s a reasonable strategy, but you can understand why shareholders aren\u2019t excited.",

The boss of WPP attracts flak every year when he collects the winnings from his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/30/wpp-boss-martin-sorrell-paid-43m-last-year-britains-best-paid-ceo\">supercharged incentive scheme</a>, but they almost look modest when set against the financial prizes accumulating at Berkeley Group, the company that builds one in 10 new homes in London.</p> <p>Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman, got \u00a320m worth of shares in April from a long-term scheme created in 2009, yesterday\u2019s annual report revealed; the same scheme is virtually nailed on to pay out similarly next year. </p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/24/berkeley-housebuilder-dividend-windfall\">these distributions</a> (actually worth \u00a325m now because of the subsequent jump in the share price) are appetisers. The main course is the 2011-21 scheme, which already looks likely to generate what could be the biggest payout to the board of a UK public company.</p> <p>Pidgley and his managing director Rob Perrins each have 5m options under the 2011 scheme; three other directors have a combined 5.1m shares. That 15.1m collection is potentially worth \u00a3528m at the current share price of \u00a335, or \u00a3400m if one deducts the value of dividends that must be paid to hit the jackpot.</p> <p>The key point is that Berkeley directors have cleared the first dividend hurdle on the way to a full payout and are odds-on to jump the other two, especially now that the Conservative party\u2019s general election victory in May has killed talk of a mansion tax. As the annual report said: \u201cThe board considers that the group is well positioned to meet the remaining milestones of 433p by September 2018 and 433p by September 2021.\u201d</p> <p>A 10-year scheme is long and, viewed through the lens of the 2011 property market, the targets would have looked tough. Berkeley, in effect, was aiming to return its entire market capitalisation, or \u00a31.7bn, to investors via dividends within a decade. Shareholders thus approved an arrangement whereby 13% of Berkeley\u2019s equity could be handed to the directors as a bonus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/10/warren-buffett-six-key-deals-coca-cola-gillette\">Warren Buffett: six key deals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet the thick end of half a billion quid shared between five individuals would be an extraordinary landmark in the rise of boardroom pay in the UK. Sums became life-changing long ago, but this could be another league.</p> <p>Pidgley, it might be argued, is a unique individual whose ability to read the property market is essential to Berkeley\u2019s success \u2013 similar arguments are made to justify Sorrell\u2019s rewards. Yet, in Berkeley\u2019s case, we are talking about mega-sums being collected by an entire board. Divisional director Sean Ellis, for example, is on course for a \u00a360m payday at the current share price.</p> <p>Berkeley is an unusual company, certainly, and not all housebuilders have trebled their share prices since 2011, despite George Osborne\u2019s many housing-friendly measures. But the precedent here can\u2019t be good. Directors everywhere, under pressure to lengthen their long-term incentive schemes, will draw a straightforward conclusion: if they have to wait longer for their prizes, they will want their potential jackpots to be bigger \u2013 much bigger. Berkeley will be exhibit A as they make that demand.</p> <h2>A textbook acquisition for Warren Buffett</h2> <p>Precision Castparts is a typical Warren Buffett deal \u2013 it\u2019s an industrial company with a long history and a well-entrenched position in a big market, namely components for airplanes. \u201cWith few exceptions, every aircraft in the sky flies with parts made by Precision,\u201d the company can claim.</p> <p>The timing also follows the familiar textbook. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/10/warren-buffett-biggest-buy-yet-precision-castparts\">Buffett is buying after the share price has fallen from its highs</a>, in this case because of weakness in the oil and gas markets, which Precision also supplies.</p> <p>So far, so predictable. But, at $32.5bn, Buffett is paying 19 times his earnings for a company whose profits have gone roughly sideways for the past two years. The great man, naturally, is more interested in the next two decades. If his analysis is that the number of planes in the air will only increase, he may be vindicated. Even so, this is not a straightforward bargain. Berkshire\u2019s biggest deal probably won\u2019t be its best. That\u2019s the problem of being so huge already.</p> <h2>Esure looking unsure</h2> <p>Some two years after arriving on the stock market, Esure is still almost a fifth below its flotation price. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/aug/10/esure-sheilas-wheels-raise-premiums-motor-insurance-profits-fall\">Car insurance, it seems, is a rough market</a> \u2013 lots of whiplash claims and intense pressure on premiums. Underlying profits fell 21% to \u00a346.5m in the first half.</p> <p>\u201cThe management team continue to act in a disciplined manner in challenging market conditions,\u201d says its founder and chairman, Peter Wood. Translation: we are going to lose market share by putting up prices but we have to do it anyway. It\u2019s a reasonable strategy, but you can understand why shareholders aren\u2019t excited.</p>",

Leading farming unions called on the government to introduce long-term contracts between farmers, distributors and supermarkets and to force retailers to clearly label whether their products are British or imported. The emergency summit in London followed days of protests from farmers over the sharp fall in the prices they are being paid for milk. Asda and Morrisons distribution centres have been blockaded, farmers have removed cartons of milk from supermarkets and cows were paraded through the aisles of an Asda store in Stafford. Figures from AHDB Dairy, the trade body, show that the average UK farmgate price for milk \u2013 the price that farmers are paid \u2013 has fallen by 25% over the last year, to 23.66p per litre. Industry experts claim it costs farmers 30p per litre to produce milk, meaning farms have been thrown into chaos by the drop in prices. Farmers have blamed the fall in prices on a supermarket price war but retailers claim the drop reflects declining commodity prices and an oversupply of milk, partly caused by Russia\u2019s block on western imports. Farmers For Action, the campaign group behind the milk protests, is scheduled to meet representatives from Morrisons on Tuesday to discuss the crisis. The farming unions warned of \u201cdire consequences for the farming industry and rural economy\u201d if the way in which food is sold does not change in the near future. The presidents of the NFU, NFU Scotland, NFU Cymru, Ulster Farmers Union and four other unions, said: \u201cWe would urge farm ministers across the UK to meet urgently. They need to admit that something has gone fundamentally wrong in the supply chain and take remedial action. \u201cIn general, voluntary codes are not delivering their intended purpose. Government needs to take action to ensure that contracts to all farmers are longer-term and fairer in apportioning risk and reward. \u201cGovernment also needs to urgently ensure that rules are put in place regarding labelling so that it is clear and obvious which products are imported and which are British.\u201d The trade unions said they wanted the government to push for change at the European meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 7 September. In a direct message to retailers, they added: \u201cStop devaluing fresh British food like milk purely to get customers through the door.\u201d Arla, the biggest milk supplier in Britain, is to launch a new logo on its milk to show it was \u201cresponsibility sourced\u201d from local farms. Supermarkets will have to agree to a series of conditions, including long-term contracts and a commitment to pay prices in line with the wider market, in order to sell milk with the logo. Arla is a cooperative owned by more than 13,000 farmers, including 3,000 in the UK, who are paid from the profit the group makes. Ash Amirahmadi, head of milk at Arla, warned that some farmers were being paid as little as 12p or 13p per litre and that the present situation was unsustainable. He added: \u201cOur farmers are incredibly concerned at the moment. There is a reason why farmers are going out protesting; they are not bad people.\u201d Amirahmadi urged retailers to make themselves \u201cpart of the solution\u201d by signing up to the new conditions and improving the labelling of British products. \u201cSome retailers are not far off following this already but it is not transparent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make it more transparent for our farmers.\u201d Dairy UK, the body that oversees the country\u2019s largest dairies and processors, which buy milk from farmers before selling it to supermarkets, said there is a global downturn in prices that is likely to worsen. Judith Bryans, chief executive of Dairy UK, whose members include M\u00fcller, Dairy Crest, and First Milk, said: \u201cAll markets are still under severe pressure and there is no denying that market conditions won\u2019t get tougher before they get better. \u201cVolatility is an inherent feature of the dairy industry and we need to work as effectively and collaboratively as possible to find instruments which will help farmers in cycles of extreme volatility. But in terms of what is happening at the moment, prices will not increase until global production eases and the market is no longer over supplied. \u201cWe as an industry need to work together to weather the current storm and develop ways of helping farmers manage cyclical volatility in the future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets around the world have been lifted by hopes that the Chinese government will allow its currency to devalue to boost growth after figures at the weekend showed a surprise slump in exports from the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The FTSE turned a near 80-point loss into a 17-point gain on Monday as investors speculated that Beijing will move to offset further bad news from its manufacturing sector on Wednesday with a package of measures to help exports. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 223 points, or 1.3%, in early afternoon trading. Copper prices recovered from a six year-low while oil prices edged back to $49.77. The oil price had slumped in early trading after the mixed weekend figures from China showed crude oil imports rose by 4.1% in July from June, but broader trade data revealed an 8.3% slump in exports. Fears that Chinese economic activity was slowing helped push the benchmark North Sea Brent oil down to $48.24 a barrel, its lowest level in more than six months. Analysts said they expected China\u2019s central bank to respond with a further easing of monetary policy to push down borrowing costs and the value of the currency. Wei Yao, an analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said: \u201cJudging from recent data, the economy is still under immense downward pressure.\u201d She said high pork prices were a major factor squeezing disposable incomes and forcing the government to act. China produces and consumes approximately half the world\u2019s pigs. Yao said: \u201cHigher pork prices squeeze other consumption in the absence of any acceleration in income growth. Therefore, fiscal policy has to step up and monetary policy is likely to play an assisting role by providing targeted liquidity.\u201d The central bank is not likely to cut its main interest rate, but would use other, less obvious methods of easing the constraints on banks to lend, she said. China has suffered a year-long slowdown that has dragged down global growth and hit neighbouring Vietnam, Thailand and South Korea, which rely on it as the engine of the region\u2019s economic growth. Alongside the instability in the global economy wrought by the Greek debt crisis, China\u2019s economic woes have been the main drag on growth over the past year. A sharp slide in share values on the Shanghai stock market last month alarmed Chinese investors and was only prevented from turning into a rout after the central bank stepped in to impose tight trading rules. Jeremy Batstone-Carr, a market analyst at Charles Stanley, said more weak data from China could prompt the Beijing authorities to allow the currency to devalue against the dollar and the euro. He said: \u201cThe pressure is rising on China to devalue, which would support China\u2019s equity [markets].\u201d Prices of most commodities have tumbled on world markets over the past six months as traders forecast declining sales in China. Foodstuffs have joined a slump in metals and energy prices following predictions that China, which has struggled with an overheated property market and the recent stock market crash, may not maintain its previously strong rate of growth. But on Monday, the Shanghai Composite Index had its best day since early July, climbing 4.9% to 3,928. Mainland investors brushed off the gloomy data at the weekend and pinned their hopes on fresh support measures for the economy. Du Changchun, an analyst at Northeast Securities in Shanghai, said: \u201cChina\u2019s economic indicators are not very good, which means monetary policy will continue to be accommodative.\u201d The figures show exports to the EU fell 12.3% in July, while those to the US dropped 1.3%. Demand from Japan, another big trading partner, slid 13%. China\u2019s factory activity suffered its biggest contraction in two years in July as the number of new orders fell.",

Fears that Chinese economic activity was slowing helped push the benchmark North Sea Brent oil down to $48.24 a barrel, its lowest level in more than six months.</p> <p>Analysts said they expected China\u2019s central bank to respond with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/17/chinas-biggest-banks-loan-stock-market-chinese-securities-finances-margin-lending\">further easing of monetary policy</a> to push down borrowing costs and the value of the currency. Wei Yao, an analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said: \u201cJudging from recent data, the economy is still under immense downward pressure.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/01/fears-for-chinese-economy-as-shares-fall\">Chinese shares are falling, but the real fear is that the economy itself is slowing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She said high pork prices were a major factor squeezing disposable incomes and forcing the government to act. <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21636507-chinas-insatiable-appetite-pork-symbol-countrys-rise-it-also\">China produces and consumes approximately half the world\u2019s pigs</a>.</p> <p>Yao said: \u201cHigher pork prices squeeze other consumption in the absence of any acceleration in income growth. Therefore, fiscal policy has to step up and monetary policy is likely to play an assisting role by providing targeted liquidity.\u201d</p> <p>The central bank is not likely to cut its main interest rate, but would use other, less obvious methods of easing the constraints on banks to lend, she said.</p> <p>China has suffered a year-long slowdown that has dragged down global growth and hit neighbouring Vietnam, Thailand and South Korea, which rely on it as the engine of the region\u2019s economic growth.</p> <p>Alongside the instability in the global economy wrought by the Greek debt crisis, China\u2019s economic woes have been the main drag on growth over the past year. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/china-stock-market-crisis-explained\">sharp slide in share values on the Shanghai stock market</a> last month alarmed Chinese investors and was only prevented from turning into a rout after the central bank stepped in to impose tight trading rules.</p> <p>Jeremy Batstone-Carr, a market analyst at Charles Stanley, said more weak data from China could prompt the Beijing authorities to allow the currency to devalue against the dollar and the euro. He said: \u201cThe pressure is rising on China to devalue, which would support China\u2019s equity [markets].\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/27/the-commodities-rout-why-prices-are-falling\">Prices of most commodities have tumbled</a> on world markets over the past six months as traders forecast declining sales in China. Foodstuffs have joined a slump in metals and energy prices following predictions that China, which has struggled with an overheated property market and the recent stock market crash, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/01/fears-for-chinese-economy-as-shares-fall\">may not maintain its previously strong rate of growth</a>. But on Monday, the Shanghai Composite Index had its best day since early July, climbing 4.9% to 3,928.</p> <p>Mainland investors brushed off the gloomy data at the weekend and pinned their hopes on fresh support measures for the economy. Du Changchun, an analyst at Northeast Securities in Shanghai, said: \u201cChina\u2019s economic indicators are not very good, which means monetary policy will continue to be accommodative.\u201d</p> <p>The figures show exports to the EU fell 12.3% in July, while those to the US dropped 1.3%. Demand from Japan, another big trading partner, slid 13%. China\u2019s factory activity suffered its biggest contraction in two years in July as the number of new orders fell.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Amazon has moved a step closer to launching a grocery service in the UK, taking over the lease on a warehouse previously used by Tesco. The US online retailer is to use the site in Weybridge, Surrey, which used to be a Tesco distribution centre and is ideally positioned just inside the M25 to deliver fresh food to London shoppers. Amazon\u2019s grocery service, Amazon Fresh, is already available in Seattle, California and New York and the company is now close to launching in the UK. The online retailer has presented its grocery plans to major food manufacturers in Britain and could launch the service as early as next month. The launch would put further pressure on Britain\u2019s beleaguered supermarkets, which have suffered a slump in sales and profits, and are battling for customers with price cuts. Amazon Fresh has the potential to revolutionise grocery shopping in Britain. In California, shoppers use it to buy food from local shops and restaurants, while a wireless device called Amazon Dash monitors when users run out of household essentials and orders replacements. Amazon already sells household essentials such as tea, toothpaste and washing-up liquid, but Amazon Fresh includes fruit, vegetables, bread and meat. The company confirmed it was opening a delivery station in Weybridge, but declined to comment whether this would form part of Amazon Fresh in the UK, calling the potential launch of a grocery service \u201crumour and speculation\u201d. Amazon said it will employ 20 people directly at the site in Brooklands business park, with four independent delivery companies also hiring 140 drivers to work from the station. This tallies with rumours that Amazon plans to use third-party drivers and vans fitted with cool boxes to deliver groceries. The warehouse covers 300,000 sq ft, which is a similar size to other facilities used for online grocery deliveries. It has been empty since Tesco closed its distribution centre in 2013 with the loss of hundreds of jobs. A company called Clegg Food Projects is understood to be revamping the warehouse for Amazon, although the site already includes chiller cabinets. According to its website, Clegg Food specialises in \u201cproviding practical solutions for major food and drink operations\u201d. The website adds: \u201cWhether it\u2019s a multimillion-pound new food facility, or if you\u2019re looking to improve your existing manufacturing processes, our team of specialists can help come up with the best solutions for your project.\u201d Amazon has also agreed to lease a warehouse in Bardon, Leicestershire. A spokesman for the company said this would also be a \u201cdelivery and sortation station\u201d, although the building is thought to have planning permission to store food. It will replace a smaller site at nearby Castle Donington, which will close in the autumn. Amazon has stepped up its investment in UK delivery services in recent months. As well as launching Sunday deliveries, Amazon offers one-hour delivery on more than 20,000 products in London and Birmingham. The Weybridge site will be Amazon\u2019s 15th delivery station in the UK, while the company also has eight \u201cfulfilment centres\u201d across the country where orders are packaged for delivery. Amazon is opening a ninth fulfilment centre in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, which could also be used for Amazon Fresh. The launch of Amazon Fresh would pit Amazon directly against Ocado, which is the biggest online-only grocery retailer in Britain but has struggled to make a profit. Ocado shares have fallen by 15% in the past month as speculation that Amazon could start delivering groceries has increased.",

      "bodyText": "Standard Chartered bank is pulling out of a vast coalmining project in Australia that critics say threatens endangered species and could wreck international efforts to contain global warming. The London-based bank revealed on Monday it was giving up its role advising the Indian conglomerate, Adani, on building one of the world\u2019s biggest coalmines in Queensland and expanding a port on the Great Barrier Reef. The decision to pull out of the A$16bn (\u00a37.8bn) Carmichael mine and port throws the project further into doubt. Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Bank gave up its advisory role last week, after a ruling by an Australian court overturning federal government approval for the mine. A spokesman from Standard Chartered said: \u201cBoth parties [Adani and Standard Chartered] have agreed to end the bank\u2019s role in the Carmichael project.\u201d Standard Chartered is one of the UK\u2019s largest banks, but does most of its business in Asia. The bank\u2019s involvement in the Carmichael coalmine was exposing it to reputational damage, after a string of international lenders, including Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, said they would not touch the mining project. In May, the bank told its investors at its annual general meeting it would go no further with the project until it was fully satisfied with its environmental credentials. Bank officials have held separate meetings with representatives from Greenpeace and the Wangan and Jagalingou people, a group of Indigenous Australians campaigning to preserve their ancestral lands from being destroyed by mining. But until now, the bank had declined to say whether it would give up its advisory role. A spokesman said: \u201cStandard Chartered outlined at its AGM earlier this year that it would listen to and consult with a wide range of stakeholders before participating further in the Carmichael project. This process of engagement, which has been extensive, has enabled us to review and assess the competing demands of, and on, the energy sector. \u201cAs a result of this ongoing review by Standard Chartered and the delays experienced by Adani in receipt of its project approvals, both parties have agreed to end the bank\u2019s role in the Carmichael project.\u201d Adani Australia said in a statement it had requested the termination of Standard Chartered\u2019s financial advisory role, on the basis of Adani\u2019s own concerns over delays to the approvals process for the mine. \u201cThe company values the partnership it has enjoyed with Standard Chartered,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAs Standard Chartered has noted, the delays experienced by Adani in receipt of its project approvals informed the decision. \u201cIn the event Australia\u2019s federal approvals framework is not further undermined by activists seeking to exploit legal loopholes, enabling the project and the thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of investment it would bring to be delivered, Adani would happily work with the bank in future.\u201d Adani\u2019s claims on the jobs and investment the mine would provide have been disputed in court using its own modelling. The bank maintains that it was never a lender to the project, although a senior executive at Adani\u2019s Australian mining subsidiary told a Queensland court in April that Standard Chartered had lent it $680m (\u00a3448m) for the project. Sebastian Bock at Greenpeace said Standard Chartered\u2019s decision was welcome and was an acknowledgment that involvement in the mine was \u201ca bad deal, from an environmental, commercial and reputational point of view, and in conflict with the bank\u2019s own policies\u201d. Bock said: \u201cIt is now up to the remaining parties, in particular the Australian government, to also recognise this reality and cancel this destructive project.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In more than 50 years of investing, Warren Buffett has bought and sold stakes in some of the biggest companies in the world through his Berkshire Hathaway vehicle. As the famous investor unveils his biggest deal yet, the $37.2bn takeover of Precision Castparts, here are six of his most notable transactions. Goldman Sachs In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, Buffett stunned Wall Street by investing $5bn (\u00a33.2bn) in Goldman Sachs. The complex deal gave Buffett $5bn of preferred stock paying a 10% dividend and the option to buy a further $5bn of shares for less than their market value at the time. The result? Goldman got some much-needed cash along with the Buffett stamp of approval and Berkshire Hathaway eventually made a profit of more than $3bn. Tesco Buffett\u2019s maxim of buying when others are fearful failed with Tesco. He started buying shares in Britain\u2019s biggest retailer in 2006 when Tesco appeared all-powerful. In 2012, Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake to more than 5% and became Tesco\u2019s third-biggest shareholder after Tesco issued a profit warning. But Tesco\u2019s problems mounted, culminating in last year\u2019s accounting scandal, and Buffett admitted the investment was a \u201chuge mistake\u201d. Coca-Cola Buffett advocates buying companies whose products you like and his 9% stake in the world\u2019s biggest soft drink maker is an exemplar of that strategy. Buffett, who is teetotal, claims a quarter of his daily calories come from drinking Coke. He has described Coke as an \u201cinevitable\u201d company likely to be around for ever; Berkshire Hathaway has made billions from its stake. Last year, Buffett ran into trouble when he said Berkshire Hathaway abstained on a bumper pay deal for Coke\u2019s management because it was \u201ckind of un-American\u201d to vote against Coke. Freddie Mac Berkshire Hathaway started buying shares in the giant US mortgage lender in the late 80s and came to own almost 9% of the company. But Buffett became concerned that Freddie Mac was taking on too much risk to meet quarterly earnings forecasts and sold almost all Berkshire\u2019s stake in 1999 for a $2.75bn profit. Freddie Mac was bailed out by the US government in 2008 after racking up billions of dollars of losses from defaults on mortgages. Gillette Buffett viewed Gillette as another inevitable brand whose dominance in shaving products was akin to Coca-Cola\u2019s in beverages. Berkshire Hathaway began buying shares in the late 1980s and became Gillette\u2019s biggest shareholder. Berkshire Hathaway made an estimated $4.4bn paper profit when Procter &amp; Gamble bought Gillette in 2005 and Buffett\u2019s company became P&amp;G\u2019s biggest investor before swapping its shares for P&amp;G\u2019s Duracell business and $1.7bn of cash last year. Heinz Berkshire Hathaway joined forces with 3G Capital, a private equity firm, to buy Heinz for $28bn in 2013. Buffett said the purchase was \u201cmy kind of deal\u201d and that he had sampled Heinz\u2019s tomato sauce many times. In March, Buffett orchestrated Heinz\u2019s $40bn merger with Kraft, creating a stronger counterweight to the purchasing power of retailers. The combined company faces a challenge in adapting to the changing eating habits of US consumers, who are opting for fresher, healthier options.",

      "bodyText": "The day began with hopes of a Greek debt breakthrough but, as the history of these debt talks shows, there\u2019s a long way to go between the germ of a deal and the signing on the dotted line. What is certain, for sure, is that Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, is on its way to consummating its record takeover, a $37bn bid for an aerospace parts supplier. The sage of Omaha has been busy justifiying the high multiple he is paying for that not so well known company, Precision Castparts. On the UK stock markets, miners had a torrid time following a bearish note from Investec. Meanwhile oil prices hit an eight month low, putting the Russian economy, among others, under strain. That\u2019s all for today. Warren Buffett has revealed details on CNBC of his company\u2019s $37bn takeover of Precision Castparts, which is not exactly a household name. And he\u2019s admitted that he\u2019s paying a \u201cvery high multiple\u201d for the aerospace industry supplier. Buffett told CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box he made a bid for Precision during the Allen &amp; Co. Sun Valley conference last month. This is right up there at the top of expensive deals. This a very high multiple for us to pay,\u201d said Buffett. He\u2019s also told the financial news station that he\u2019s planning some further small deals over the next few months. The New York Times points out that not many people will have heard of Buffett\u2019s latest acquisition. Turning away from Greece to another story that has dominated financial news over the past year: the plunge in oil prices. Members of the OPEC oil exporters group have insisted they have no plans for an emergency meeting, as oil prices fell to their lowest level since January. A barrel of Brent crude - the industry benchmark - is hovering at just under $49, slightly up from an earlier low of $48, but a far cry from the $100 plus level of June 2014. Algeria\u2019s energy minister Salah Khebri said discussions about holding a meeting were ongoing, although other unnamed OPEC officials said there was no suggestion of a meeting before a scheduled December gathering. OPEC is split over how to respond to the fall in oil prices: Algeria favours supply cuts to defend prices, while dominant Saudi Arabia and the Gulf members want to protect market share, even if that means taking a hit on lower prices. Further reading: this Guardian analysis explains why the US oil book lies behind Opec\u2019s reluctance to cut supplies. Further further reading: Energy expert Nick Butler has written an informative piece for the Financial Times (\u00a3) on how low oil prices and falling gas revenues are putting the Russian economy under severe strain. Here is the problem with oil prices: As a result of the fall in oil prices, the Russian economy is predicted to decline by 3.5% this year, with oil export revenue down by $95bn, after suffering a fall of $174bn in 2013. Gas isn\u2019t helping the Kremlin either: Gazprom is set to produce less gas this year than at any time since the fall of the Soviet Union. The troubles with the Russian economy are systemic: Russia\u2019s immediate problem is not sanctions imposed by the west or the continuing conflict in Ukraine. The issue is economic. Not the first outing for this comment and probably not the last... It is hardly a statistic to merit breaking out the Burgundy, but official forecasts are predicting that the French economy will grow slightly faster over the summer. The Bank of France estimates that the economy will expand by 0.3% in the third quarter, compared to 0.2% growth in the second. Agri-food industries and pharmaceuticals were expanding in July, while chemicals, machinery and automotive declined, the bank said. Activity in the service sector also picked up, especially in transport, consulting and IT. Greece\u2019s banks are the country\u2019s Achilles heel, or so says columnist Hugo Dixon, who always has interesting things to say about the Greek debt crisis. In his latest column he sets out his throughts on how to fix Greece\u2019s banks, which have been hammered by the return of capital flight and the renewed recession. Dixon argues that forcing Greek creditors to take a hit on the bank\u2019s losses is fine in theory, but not desirable in the current context because depositors would lost out. Instead he would like to see the eurozone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, take direct stakes in banks. Here is a flavour of the column: A direct recapitalisation would be preferable because it would cut the link between the government and the country\u2019s lenders. Athens would no longer be able to meddle with their management. Nor would the state, which is already virtually bust, be loaded up with up to 25 billion euros in extra loans. A further advantage is that, if the euro zone directly owned the banks, depositor confidence would be immediately boosted and capital controls could be swiftly lifted. One reason this option has not been favoured is because the ESM guidelines require a bail-in before it can inject equity. What\u2019s more, Germany has never been keen on the idea of banks being directly recapitalised. However, if the euro zone wished, it could change these guidelines. Impose strict limits on money that can be withdrawn from banks and... surprise, surprise... people buy fewer expensive items. That economic lesson was made clear on Monday by data showing that Greeks were driving fewer new cars and motorbikes off the forecourts in July, a month of strict capital controls. Nearly 8,200 cars and 3,100 motorbikes were put on the road for the first time in July 2015, a decrease of 24% and 39% respectively compared to the same month in 2014, according to number crunchers at the Hellenic Statistical Authority. Greece\u2019s economy was already slowing even before capital controls came into force on 29 June. Other Elstat data released on Monday showed a 4.5% year-on-year fall in factory production in June. Warren Buffett, the legendary American investor known as the Sage of Omaha, is set to clinch one of his biggest deals ever, a more than $30bn takeover of Precision Castparts. Buffett\u2019s investment group Berkshire Hathaway already owns a 3 per cent stake in the company, which is a supplier to General Electric, Boeing and Airbus. Precision Castparts, headquartered in Portland, Oregon, was valued at $26.7bn on Friday. Read more here: Warren Buffett lines up his biggest buy yet with $30bn acquisition Hot off the wires, Greece\u2019s economy could shrink by 2.3% in 2015, after a year of chaotic bailout talks. Here are the snaps, courtesy of Reuters Greece, creditors estimate economy will shrink between 2.1%-2.3% in 2015, primary surplus target set to zero - gov official. EU Commission says deal with Greece can be reached in the month of August. The first statement is especially interesting, suggesting that creditors are prepared to give Greece more leeway on budget targets, because of the dire state of the economy. JR Greece\u2019s centre-right party New Democracy will not join forces with other opposition groups to form a pro-European centre party in the event of snap elections this autumn, its leader has said. New Democracy leader Evangelos Meimarakis told Kathimerini there was no scope for coalition in the event of snap elections. Athens has been buzzing with speculation about early elections since prime minister Alexis Tispras lost the support of almost 40 of his MPs in a vote on the Greek bailout deal last month. Meimarakis, who replaced former prime minister Antonis Samaras in the wake of the 5 July referendum, said New Democracy would not be dissolved in favour of a united European party, adding that electoral law made a coalition \u201cvery difficult\u201d. He also contended that \u201clabels such as centre-right or centre-left have to a great degree disappeared\u201d. I would say the main distinction is between common sense and irrationality, between who is responsible and irresponsible, who is European or not. JR Better to be careful than hasty. That is the gist of the view on Greece from the German government. At a regular government press conference, spokesman Steffen Seibert said a swift Greek bailout deal was desirable, but added that it was more important to be reach a thorough agreement. Germany\u2019s concerns about the smallprint of the bailout were highlighted on Monday by one ally of chancellor Angela Merkel. Ralph Brinkhaus, deputy parliamentary floor leader for Merkel\u2019s conservatives, told Deutschlandfunk radio that a lot of questions remained open. He would prefer Greece to get a smaller sum of bailout aid than the \u20ac30bn proposed by the International Monetary Fund. The more money is handed out in one stroke, the less leverage one has to stop payments if the reform process in Greece does not pan out as planned and as promised. Via Reuters Greek bond yields fall on bailout deal hopes Bond traders are feeling pretty optimistic about the prospects of a deal on Greece\u2019s third international bailout. Yields on Greece\u2019s two-year bonds have fallen 43 basis points to 20.69% on Monday, with 10-year yields 12 bps lower at 11.77%. For comparison, 10-year yields hit 19% in early July when Greece and its international creditors were on the brink of divorce. The next ten days will be critical if Greece is to get a proposed \u20ac86bn loan. Here is how events might unfold, although any timetable comes with a health warning. Officials on the creditor side are sounding more cautious than the Greek government. But these are the key dates to watch over the next 10 days: Tuesday 11 The Greek government hopes to conclude talks with European officials in Athens by Tuesday morning. As one anonymous Greek government official told Reuters: Efforts are being made to conclude the negotiations, the horizon is by Monday night or early Tuesday. Friday 14 Possible meeting of eurozone finance ministers to review the deal - a Memorandum of Understanding setting out the detailed terms of the bailout. An unnamed EU official: Until the MoU is on the table and signed, we are still cautious. Tue 18 Greek parliament to vote on bailout package. A Greek government spokeswoman said: There is a good climate in the talks and in the mood of the institutions showing that this timeframe will be met. Thu 20 Greece must repay \u20ac3.5bn to the European Central Bank. Missing this deadline would result in the ECB pulling support for Greek banks, although that is an unlikely outcome. Greece would be more likely to get another emergency loan if the timetable slips. UK farming unions are due to meet today at an emergency summit as protests grow over falling milk prices. The farming unions are protesting about discounts at most of the major supermarket groups that they claim result in them producing milk at a loss. Protests have included farmers buying up all the milk at some stores. Cows have also been paraded through the aisles of Asda, one of the chief culprits in the eyes of the farmers. Here is a video of the cow protest. So the cautiously positive opening on the London markets hasn\u2019t lasted, with shares now in negative territory. The FTSE 100 is off more than 50 points at 6665 as mining stocks, both in the top index and below the top tier of companies, lose ground on a broker\u2019s downgrade. Broker Investec downgraded several stocks in the sector and lowered its commodity price forecast due to China weakness. Aside from the problems at Dixons Carphone, down 1.2% on the data breach issues, insurance group Esure dropped 9.3% after its interim results missed analysts\u2019 forecasts. Here are the headlines from the Investec note on mining, which is doing damage to the sector this morning. Mining: Commodity prices in the \u201cNew Normal\u201d The increasing problems in China have caused us to reassess our commodity price outlook., says a note from the South African-based bank. Our price profile is designed to reflect our conviction that the super cycle, driven by a structural shift in the demand curve resulting from China\u2019s industrialisation and a protracted lag in the supply response, is now well and truly over. Mining shares have reflected further weakness in underlying commodities and appear set for a fifth straight year of underperformance relative to wider equity markets. Our earnings adjustments have meant downgrades for nearly all of the companies under our coverage. While Glencore moves to a Sell, we retain Hold recommendations on the other three majors: Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Anglo American. We retain our view that the sector is unlikely to recover anytime soon, especially as signals from China appear to be deteriorating. Financial markets are opening cautiously higher, with the FTSE up 0.5%. One stock falling though is Dixons Carphone, whose shares are the third largest faller, down 0.8%, after the personal data breach of 2.4m of the group\u2019s customers. Not everybody sees a Greek deal as inevitable, though. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the business and economics world. Once again, Greece is in the spotlight after overnight talks took a definitely positive step forwards. Greece is inching towards a deal with its international creditors, according to reports out of Athens this morning. Sources are confidently predicting that a deal on the \u20ac86bn bailout plan will be now be reached after significant concessions have been made by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras which seem to have won over even the hawkish Finns. The main concessions of the proposed deal include spending cuts, public sector reforms and privatisations. An official told Reuters: From midnight the two sides started the final stretch - combing through the final text, sentence by sentence, word by word. In London the defections keep coming at the spread betting company IG Group. Weeks after Tim Howkins, IG Group\u2019s chief executive, said he was retiring after nine years comes news today that the group\u2019s chief financial officer Chris Hill is on his way to Hargreaves Lansdown. We\u2019ll be checking for reaction to Greece throughout the morning.",

Instead he would like to see the eurozone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, take direct stakes in banks.</p> <p>Here is a flavour of the column:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A direct recapitalisation would be preferable because it would cut the link between the government and the country\u2019s lenders. Athens would no longer be able to meddle with their management. Nor would the state, which is already virtually bust, be loaded up with up to 25 billion euros in extra loans. A further advantage is that, if the euro zone directly owned the banks, depositor confidence would be immediately boosted and capital controls could be swiftly lifted.</p> <p>One reason this option has not been favoured is because the ESM guidelines require a bail-in before it can inject equity. What\u2019s more, Germany has never been keen on the idea of banks being directly recapitalised. However, if the euro zone wished, it could change these guidelines.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-08-10T11:46:08.620Z\">at 12.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55c87ee5e4b0ae6e92d43d4d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-10T11:04:32.751Z\">12.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Capital controls curb Greek spending</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Impose strict limits on money that can be withdrawn from banks and... surprise, surprise... people buy fewer expensive items.</strong><br></p> <p>That economic lesson was made clear on Monday by data showing that Greeks were driving fewer new cars and motorbikes off the forecourts in July, a month of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33303540\">strict capital controls</a>.</p> <p>Nearly 8,200 cars and 3,100 motorbikes were put on the road for the first time in July 2015, a decrease of 24% and 39% respectively compared to the same month in 2014, according to number crunchers at the Hellenic Statistical Authority.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Manos Giakoumis\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-partner=&quot;tweetdeck&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The impact of capital controls was clearly evident in Jul. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Greece&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/economy?src=hash&quot;&gt;#economy&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/pMFewW2Gh8&quot;&gt;https://t.co/pMFewW2Gh8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Manos Giakoumis (@ManosGiakoumis) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ManosGiakoumis/status/630665937159634945&quot;&gt;August 10, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>Greece\u2019s economy was already slowing even before capital controls came into force on 29 June</strong>.

      "bodyText": "The boss of Berkeley Homes, one of the UK\u2019s biggest housebuilders, received \u00a323.3m last year at the start of a series of payouts to the company\u2019s top executives that could add up to \u00a3500m in the next six years. The payment to Tony Pidgley was part of \u00a342m of bonuses for the top five executives at Berkeley who appear to be on track for one of the biggest pay awards ever handed out by a UK listed company. The \u00a342m they shared this year is expected to be matched by a similar amount next year. By 2021 they could be sitting on share bonuses worth a combined \u00a3500m if targets for returns to shareholders set in 2011 are met. Pidgley\u2019s \u00a323.2m in cash and shares cements his position as one of the wealthiest business executives in the UK, with the Sunday Times Rich List having already estimated his fortune at \u00a3212m (\u00a3). Pidgley, who co-founded Berkley nearly 30 years ago, was adopted from Barnardos by travellers when he was four and spent his early years living in a disused railway carriage. His pay award for the year to the end of April is outlined in the group\u2019s annual report (pdf), which shows his \u00a3825,000 salary is bolstered by \u00a32.4m in annual bonuses and payouts from long-term incentive plans dating back at least five years, worth \u00a319.8m. The numbers in the annual report are based on a share price of \u00a327, although the shares are currently trading at \u00a335, meaning that Pidgley\u2019s total could be bolstered even further. Pidgley has become known for his ability to call the housing market, notably sitting on cash in the run-up in the banking crisis. Berkeley is focusing on upmarket homes in London and the south-east of England, building 10% of all new homes in the capital. But it has run into criticism over some of the developments, including Woodberry Down in north-east London, where long-term residents have complained about their treatment. Among other directors sharing in the long-term bonuses are Rob Perrins, who joined the company 20 years ago and is now managing director. His \u00a3500,000 salary was boosted by the long-term bonuses which took his total to \u00a312.3m. The annual report shows that former finance director Nick Simpkin, who left in September, is taking legal action against the company. He was replaced by Richard Stearn, from Quintain, who received \u00a31.6m to buy him out of previous awards. The company pointed to the long-term performance after the payments were announced. Profits for the year were \u00a3539m, up 42% while the shares have risen 15% this year to \u00a335.29p The company said: \u201cOur policy is to reward success over the long-term and these awards reflect the value delivered to shareholders through a total shareholder return of 300% over the last six years.\u201d The biggest rewards are still to come. The scheme put in place in 2011 is based on \u00a31.7bn being returned to shareholders by 2021. In the annual report Pidgley said: \u201cThe board considers that the group is well positioned to meet the remaining milestones of 433p by September 2018 and 433p by September 2021\u201d. The precise level of payments to executives will depend on the share price. Pidgley, who is said to have left school barely able to read and write at the age of 15, set up the business with Jim Farrer in 1976. He previously set up a haulage business that he sold at the age of 20, before turning to the housebuilding trade. In the runup to the election in May - when Pidgley showed his support for the Conservatives in a letter to the Daily Telegraph - Pidgley sold 750,000 shares for \u00a318.7m. In the annual report, he said: \u201cWe welcome the stability in central government following the general election and the commitment to increase housing supply, but political uncertainty remains with the London mayoral election and referendum on Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe on the horizon.\u201d The annual report also details dealings between the company and its directors. For instance, Pidgley paid \u00a325,470 for works carried out at his home under the group\u2019s own-build scheme and in 2013 bought a flat in an upmarket part of central London for \u00a310.5m, where he spent \u00a31.3m on enhancements. It also shows that Langham Homes, the company set up by his son \u2013 also called Tony \u2013 has received \u00a31.5m for land introductions over an unspecified period. At the annual meeting next month, shareholders will be asked to approve properties bought by board director Greg Fry and non-executive director Diana Brightmore-Armour because they are valued at more than \u00a3100,000.",

      "bodyText": "Warren Buffett, the octogenarian multibillionaire investor, has struck his biggest deal by agreeing to buy a US maker of aircraft components and industrial pipes for $37.2bn (\u00a324bn) including debt. Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett\u2019s investment company, has agreed a deal that values the Portland, Oregon-based Precision Castparts at about $32.5bn excluding its net debt. The price of $235 a share in cash is 21% more than the company\u2019s closing share price on Friday. Precision Castparts manufactures nuts, bolts and other fasteners for aerospace companies such as Airbus and Boeing. It also makes pipes and fittings for power and industrial companies. Berkshire Hathaway owns about 3% of the company, having started to build up a stake three years ago. Buffett\u2019s decision to use a large part of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s $67bn cash reserves to buy the entire company is a bold bet on the future of manufacturing in the US. Buffett said: \u201cI\u2019ve admired PCC\u2019s operation for a long time. For good reasons, it is the supplier of choice for the world\u2019s aerospace industry, one of the largest sources of American exports.\u201d In May, Buffett marked 50 years since he bought Berkshire Hathaway and turned what was a struggling textiles business into a $354bn conglomerate spanning insurance, confectionery and restaurants, with stakes in Coca-Cola, American Express and other US household names. The latest purchase will extend Buffett\u2019s recent push into the industrial sector, mainly in America. In the past decade, he has bought companies such as the US industrial components producer Marmon, Israeli toolmaker Iscar, and Lubrizol, the US chemicals company. Buffett ranks those unglamorous companies among what he calls the \u201cpowerhouse five\u201d \u2013 non-insurance businesses whose combined earnings are a cornerstone of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s financial performance. BNSF, the US railway operator Berkshire Hathaway purchased in 2009, is also on the list. It paid $26bn for the 77% of BNSF it did not own in what Buffett said was a bet on America. Precision Castparts has suffered from weaker demand in the energy sector due to the low oil price and last month reported quarterly profits below expectations. Revenue fell 4% to $2.4bn and operating profit dropped 16% to $619m. The near-30% fall in the company\u2019s share price since the middle of last year may well have prompted Buffett and his investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, to make a bid. Known as the \u201csage of Omaha\u201d, Buffett, 84, runs Berkshire Hathaway from a nondescript building in Omaha, the largest city in Nebraska. He is known for living frugally despite a fortune estimated at \u00a367bn and has shunned stock market fads in favour of long-term investments since buying Berkshire Hathaway. Mark Donegan, Precision Castparts\u2019 chairman and chief executive, said: \u201cWe see a unique alignment between Warren\u2019s management and investment philosophy and how we manage PCC for the long term. This transaction offers compelling and immediate value for our shareholders, and allows PCC\u2019s employees to continue to operate in the same manner that has generated many years of exceptional service and performance to our customers.\u201d Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s businesses include insurance companies such as the giant reinsurer General Re, Fruit of the Loom clothing and Dairy Queen, the fast-food chain. It has also bought and sold stakes in Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Heinz, often spotting opportunities that other investors missed. Buffett has said that Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s size makes meaningful acquisitions increasingly difficult to come by and has described finding such deals as \u201celephant hunting\u201d. Buffett is the second richest person in the US and the fourth wealthiest in the world. He has traditionally vied with his friend Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, and Carlos Slim, the Mexican telecoms mogul, for the top spot but was knocked down to number four last year by Amancio Ortega, founder of Zara, the fashion retailer. Buffett is giving away almost all his fortune by donating to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, set up by Gates to promote health and education and combat poverty. He donated $2.84bn to the foundation and other charities last month. Not all Buffett\u2019s bets pay off. He admitted in March that his \u201cthumb-sucking\u201d over selling his stake in Tesco cost Berkshire Hathaway $444m. Buffett, who advocates buying when others are fearful, increased his stake in Britain\u2019s biggest retailer in 2012 despite a profit warning but then \u201cdawdled\u201d as the bad news mounted, he said in his annual letter to shareholders.",

      "bodyText": "The rail regulator has fined Network Rail \u00a32m for inept timetabling and poor planning for upgrades that caused severe disruption at London Bridge station. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) said Network Rail had made repeated mistakes in timetabling services in and out of London Bridge, had failed to work properly with train operators, and had neglected to plan in passengers\u2019 interests. The result was that Southern and Govia Thameslink Railway missed their punctuality targets for commuter routes serving London Bridge last year. The operators accounted for a third of delays and almost half the cancelled and significantly delayed services in England and Wales. Network Rail failing mainly affected London Bridge but also caused disruption in Scotland, ORR said. Network Rail breached the terms of its licence to operate Britain\u2019s tracks, signals, large stations and other rail infrastructure, the ORR added. London Bridge station, which serves commuters into the City of London, descended into chaos over Christmas and New Year as trains were unable to get into the station. The problems continued this year and on 3 March overcrowding prompted frustrated passengers to jump ticket barriers, the ORR said in its report. The ORR chief executive, Richard Price, said: \u201cOur analysis shows that the company needs to develop a much better understanding of the impact of timetabling on the reliability of services and on rail users. \u201cThese serious issues have caused severe disruption and frustration for passengers, most notably affecting services at and around London Bridge. ORR is therefore imposing a \u00a32m fine on Network Rail \u2013 a decision we did not take lightly.\u201d The fine is a further embarrassment for Network Rail, whose soaring costs were blamed by the government for the decision to scrap or delay upgrades to reinvigorate northern England. Network Rail\u2019s former chairman, Richard Parry-Jones, was replaced in June by Sir Peter Hendy, the former chief executive of Transport for London who has been a fierce critic of London\u2019s rail commuter services. Network Rail said it had spent \u00a311m to make improvements for Southern and Thameslink passengers and that reliability had improved since January. Phil Hufton, managing director of network operations at Network Rail, said: \u201cWhile the nuts and bolts of our infrastructure are the most reliable they\u2019ve even been, severe congestion caused by record numbers of trains and passengers makes delivering a consistently reliable service a daily challenge for ourselves and the train operators.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hancock Prospecting, the mining company owned by billionaire Gina Rinehart, has criticised regulators for an \u201cunnecessary\u201d $130,000 fine for failing to file financial reports on time. The business was ordered pay the fine after pleading guilty to 13 counts of breaching section 319 of the Corporations Act 2001, which stipulates that corporations must lodge their annual report with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission within four months of the end of the financial year. Hancock Minerals, Hancock Prospecting and Hope Downs Iron Ore, all companies in Rinehart\u2019s stable, failed to submit multiple financial reports on time between 2008 and 2012, magistrate Richard Huston heard at the Central Law Courts in Perth on Monday. The maximum penalty for each charge was a fine of $13,750. In a statement, a spokesman for Hancock said the prosecution was \u201cnot necessary\u201d because the companies had paid their taxes on time, and the financial reports, while late, had been filed before the charges were laid. He also noted that the Hancock Prospecting Group had \u201cpaid billions of dollars in taxation\u201d since 2008, the date given for the earliest charges. \u201cThis prosecution highlights questions as to why some private companies must file annual accounts with a government agency even when timely paying tax, while others do not,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhat benefit is there for taxpayers of this government administration requirement for some private companies with the extra costs involved for government agencies? \u201cWhen the government is attempting to bring about policies to alleviate the decline in small business openings, decline in investment in Australia, decline in exploration, and record debt, do such government administrative requirements assist?\u201d Over-regulation is a familiar topic for Rinehart, whose wealth of $20 billion makes her Australia\u2019s richest person. The three Hancock group companies were charged in April, following an Asic investigation. In a statement on Monday, Asic commissioner, Greg Tanzer, defended the decision to prosecute. \u201cFinancial accounts hold important information for shareholders, creditors and the public to help them make informed decisions,\u201d Tanzer said. \u201cASIC will continue to take enforcement action against companies who fail to meet their financial reporting obligations.\u201d Tanzer said Asic had prosecuted 17 public companies for the same offence between July 2014 and April 2015. However the Hancock prosecution was more significant - the heftiest fine ordered in the other prosecutions was $27,000.",

      "bodyText": "Last week\u2019s job figures included a jump in the unemployment rate to 6.3%, the highest rate since June 2002. But rather than be worried, treasurer Joe Hockey should think these a beautiful \u2013 if very noisy \u2013 set of numbers. The unemployment figures were a bizarre mixture of data that really didn\u2019t make too much sense and quickly had both sides of politics setting the spin cycle to maximum. The seasonally adjusted rate of 6.3% was not only the worst figure for 13 years, it came within an Australian test innings score of being 6.4%. The actual rate was 6.349%. Had there been just an extra 112 workers unemployed, it would have been rounded up to 6.4%. Not that that would have made much difference \u2013 it still would have been the worst rate since June 2002, and to be honest there were already enough unemployed to be going on with. In July, the ABS estimated there were 800,712 people unemployed \u2013 the most since November 1994, when Australia was finally coming out of the early 1990s recession. While this sounds bad, the reality is we have about 3.8 million more people in the labour force now than we did then, so 800,000 unemployed doesn\u2019t really mean all that much. It is the reason we look at the unemployment rate \u2013 which is the number of unemployed as a percentage of the labour force \u2013 rather than the nominal number of unemployed. But surely the 6.3% unemployed figure remains bad news? Well, yes \u2013 if you believe it and if you think that the seasonally adjusted figure is the only one to look at. And even then, you have to ignore all the other data. The only reason the unemployment rate jumped was because of a big increase in the unemployed number. This would be bad, but it was a jump in people shifting from not being in the labour force to trying to find work. So essentially more people became optimistic about being able to find work. But I don\u2019t really believe that \u2013 or at least I don\u2019t believe the size of the jump. If you look at the participation rate you see a pretty odd increase in the seasonally adjusted rate that does not really look plausible: The 0.32 percentage point jump in the rate was the biggest for 13 years. That doesn\u2019t make it wrong, but it does make you pause and wonder if maybe it\u2019s more due to statistical noise than a reflection of reality. You pause even more so when you consider that 81% of the increase in the number of unemployed was due to women. In July, the ABS estimates there was a 9.35% increase in the number of women unemployed. That is the second biggest jump in 25 years. It meant the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for women went from 6.1% to 6.6%, which is also the second biggest jump for 25 years, and which, as well, is plainly ridiculous: It gets even more silly when we drill down and see most of the increase occurred in Victoria and Queensland. In Victoria, the number of women unemployed jumped 14%, and in Queensland it went up 14.7%. The unemployment rate for women in Victoria went from 6.6% to 7.5%, which is a nice bit of statistical comedy, but not a great representation of reality. All up, Australia\u2019s unemployment rate moved rather unexpectedly and erratically: The trend rate meanwhile stayed flat at 6.1%, which makes a lot more sense given what else is going on, and certainly is the number people should focus on. Seasonally adjusted figures are good for showing signs of changes occurring, but not when they don\u2019t make sense. And the seasonally adjusted figures don\u2019t make much sense at all. In the past two months the unemployment rate has risen 0.39 percentage points. In the past 25 years the only time such a rise in two months has occurred is during the GFC and during the 1990 recession. For all the spin about the unemployment rate rising because more people are entering the workforce, the reality is the unemployment rate doesn\u2019t spike up when things are going well \u2013 when things are going well people come into the labour force and get work, not remain unemployed. And that is why the figure makes little sense, because the signs are very good for employment. Annual employment growth is now above 2% for the first time since 2011: And the growth is in both full-time and part-time work: No one \u2013 not even the RBA \u2013 is quite sure why this job growth is occurring. Economic growth as a whole (when measured by GDP) is not all that flash, so employment growth should also be weak, and yet oddly it is improving. The RBA in its Statement of Monetary Policy released on Friday improved its estimates for unemployment over the next two years, even while it was downgrading its estimates for economic growth. And regardless of whatever erratic numbers the ABS throws out in its seasonally adjusted estimate \u2013 and remember it is just an estimate: the ABS is only 95% confident the unemployment rate is somewhere between 5.9% and 6.7% \u2013 the government will be happy if the jobs keep on growing. The figure of 800,000 unemployed is not the only nominal figure in play with the labour force figures \u2013 Tony Abbott promised 1m new jobs in five years. And right now it is looking much more likely to happen. Due to a slow start, the number of jobs created has never kept pace with the average of 16,667 needed each month to get 1m in five years. By July the government needed to have created 366,660 jobs since September 2013 instead of the 332,030 that actually has been created (in trend terms): But the gap is closing and closing fast. A year ago they were 46% behind the required rate, now they are just 10% behind. In September 2013, to achieve 1m jobs they needed annual employment growth to average 1.74%. It quickly rose to a required rate of 1.94% in October 2014: But due to the strong jobs growth in the past six to nine months the required annual growth rate till September 2018 is down to 1.79% \u2013 well below the current rate of 2.09%. So while the big headline unemployment figure looks bad, Hockey and Abbott will take comfort from these figures, not only because the unemployment rate will likely be revised down in the next couple months, but because as long as the jobs keep growing, they will have a lot of good news to talk about.",
