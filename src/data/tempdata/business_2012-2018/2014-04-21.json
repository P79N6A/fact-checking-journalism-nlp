      "bodyText": "David Cameron and George Osborne are to make a rare joint appearance on Tuesday to publicise an infrastructure programme that they claim will support more than 150,000 construction jobs. Visiting a transport project in the east Midlands, the prime minister and the chancellor will say that more than 200 infrastructure projects are due to be completed in 2014-15, and that more than 200 infrastructure projects are due to be started over the same period. The schemes are ones that have already been itemised in the government's national infrastructure plan, but Cameron and Osborne are keen to publicise them in order to demonstrate their commitment to what the Conservatives describe as their \"long-term economic plan\". They have tended to avoid joint appearances in the past, partly for fear of reinforcing the impression that government is run by people from highly privileged backgrounds. But, with economic indicators looking up, and the Conservatives extending their lead over Labour as the party most trusted on the economy, No 10 has decided the presentational advantages of fielding both men outweigh any potential drawbacks. One source said that Cameron and Osborne were sharing the infrastructure announcement because it was \"a very important issue\" and having both men taking part would ensure that it \"gets good coverage\". According to Downing Street, \u00a336bn will be spent on the projects starting this year, with \u00a35bn coming directly from the state, \u00a321bn from the private sector and a further \u00a310bn from joint public/private investment. The government claims this spending will support more than 150,000 construction jobs. The projects starting this financial year include: the \u00a3589m Mersey Gateway Bridge, a six-lane tolled suspension bridge linking Runcorn and Widnes; the \u00a318m Sheffield Don Valley flood relief scheme; the \u00a330m Exeter flood defence scheme; and the A1 Leeming to Barton motorway upgrade in Yorkshire, which is expected to cut journey times by 20%. The 200-plus infrastructure projects due to be completed this year include the Nottingham tram extension, the Heathrow Terminal 2 upgrade and the Gwynt y M\u00f4r offshore windfarm, currently the largest in construction in Europe. In a statement, Cameron said: \"Ensuring Britain has first class infrastructure is a crucial part of our long term economic plan: supporting business, creating jobs and providing a better future for hardworking people. \"As a crucial part of our long-term economic plan, this government is backing business with better infrastructure so that more jobs and opportunities are created for hardworking people, meaning more financial security and peace of mind for families.\" Other ministers will also be making visits on Tuesday to publicise infrastructure projects, including Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, who will be inspecting progress on a redevelopment at Birmingham New Street station. Alasdair Reisner, chief executive of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association, said that renewing the country's infrastructure could add up to 5% to GDP. \"We believe that effective infrastructure is the cornerstone of a thriving economy. Our research indicates that every job created maintaining and improving our transport and utility networks supports a total of three new jobs across the economy as a whole,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Last March, Jack Ma rose to a podium in front of a crowd of international investors, who met him with thunderous applause. \"E-commerce in the USA is like a dessert,\" he said in fluent English, his cadence calm and measured. \"But in China ... e-commerce is the main course \u2013 the only way to shop.\" Ma will find out soon how much value investors are prepared to put on his version of e-commerce. His Alibaba Group, a \"business-to-business marketplace for global trade\", is preparing to list on the New York stock exchange any day now in what is expected to be one of the largest stock market debuts in history. The Chinese company could be worth $100bn (\u00a359bn). But China's eighth-richest man does not wear his $10bn fortune on his sleeve. The stick-thin, five-foot-tall 49 year-old has a bulging forehead and expressive hands which dart about to underscore his bolder points. Yet Ma is possibly one of contemporary China's greatest success stories. Chinese media call Alibaba an \"empire,\" though Ma prefers the term \"ecosystem\". Between its two retail sites: Taobao (like a Chinese eBay) and TMall (closer to Amazon), Alibaba controls 80% of China's e-commerce market and accounts for more than half of its parcel deliveries. The company's Alipay (like a Chinese Paypal) boasts more than 800 million registered users. Last year, Ma stepped down as the company's chief executive to devote more time to making China's \"water clearer, skies bluer, and food more secure\". He has lobbied against the consumption of shark's fin. This month, he launched a campaign to crowd-source a map of the country's water quality. \"My father said if you were born 30 years ago, you'd probably be in a prison, because the ideas you have are so dangerous\" he told the American TV interviewer Charlie Rose in 2011. Both men laughed at the irony. In interviews, Ma's billionaire persona seems to blend naturally with his English-teaching pedigree. He speaks in a heady mix of aphorisms and metaphors. \"Because of [China's] rapid economic growth in the past 30 years, and the lack of religious beliefs in this country, our management follows a less consistent pattern [than the US],\" he told Washington University business professor Xiao-Ping Chen last year. \"We must take scraps from here and there, and nothing is our own.\" His own style, he said, combines precepts from Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Tai Chi. During the interview, he likened management to fish in a pond and gold bars falling from the sky. \"In China, just when the internet was getting started, there weren't many outlets for young people to express themselves. They couldn't do that in politics or even the arts, really,\" said Porter Erisman, a former Alibaba vice-president and director of Crocodile in the Yangtze, an upcoming documentary about his experience with the company. \"So the internet is where the first homegrown heroes of this new generation came from.\" Ma declined to be interviewed for this article; Alibaba's communications team said that the company is \"effectively in a quiet period.\"Ma lives in Hangzhou, a historical eastern city of 8.7 million people known for its scenic lakes and its fresh, mild cuisine. He was born two years before the start of the Cultural Revolution; his parents were performers of Ping Tan, a traditional form of theatre. As a student, Ma performed poorly in maths, but excelled in English; he would take foreigners around the city's main tourist attractions to practise. Ma failed his college entrance examination twice, but did well enough on his third try to enrol in Hangzhou Normal University, where he studied English. He graduated in 1988, and taught English for years at a local university, making $12 per month. In 1995, Ma discovered the internet during a short trip to the US. His first internet venture, the listings website Chinapages, failed. In 1999, he started Alibaba with 17 friends in his Hangzhou apartment. At the time, e-commerce was unheard of in China. \"I called myself a blind man riding on the back of blind tigers,\" he once said in a speech. Although Ma enjoys an amicable relationship with the Chinese government \u2013 authorities appreciate his economic pull \u2013 his international profile has occasionally put him in awkward situations. In the early 2000s, Yahoo caused controversy by handing over information on a journalist and a pro-democracy campaigner to the government, which jailed the two for subversion. In 2005, Ma planted his company firmly on the side of the authorities: \"We create value for the shareholders and the shareholders don't want us to oppose the government and go bankrupt,\" he said. \"Whatever [government officials] say, we'll do it.\" Yet Ma has a penchant for pushing at boundaries and has turned down numerous opportunities to form joint ventures with state-owned firms. According to a profile of Ma in the Financial Times, he has often told employees to \"be in love with the government but never marry it\". \"The frontier areas that Alibaba can move into are exciting, but they all face some government hurdles \u2013 like financial services, or telecommunications, or media,\" said Erisman. \"These are all areas that are inefficient because they're state run.\" Alibaba's newest venture is in online finance, a sector which is dominated by the state. Last summer, the People's Daily quoted Ma as calling Chinese financial regulations \"excessive\". On 12 March, Alibaba announced plans to launch a virtual credit card, allowing users to invest and buy insurance. Ma also knows that in China the political winds can change in a heartbeat. Two days after Alibaba announced plans to offer the card, China's central bank blocked the company's plans. \"Sometimes, what can beat you is not technology but just a document,\" Ma said at a technology forum last month. He did not elaborate.",

      "bodyText": "Barclays is to announce on Tuesday that it is pulling out of commodities trading as its boss Antony Jenkins attempts to focus the investment banking arm on its most profitable and least controversial areas. Just days before Jenkins faces a storm of protests about bonuses at the bank's annual general meeting, Barclays will tell staff in its commodities arm that large parts of the operation are to be shut down or sold off. The future of the commodities business \u2013 one of the world's biggest \u2013 is likely to figure in questions at Thursday's AGM where much focus is expected to be on a decision to increase bonuses by 32% after a year when profits fell 10% and shareholders were asked to back a \u00a35.8bn cash call. Jenkins pledged to halt any business that could be construed as involving speculation on food after he took the helm of the bank in 2012 when Bob Diamond quit following the Libor rigging scandal. At last year's AGM, Jenkins had insisted that Barclays only supported clients involved in food production rather than helping big investors take bets on prices. The decision to exit other areas of commodities trading such as metals, agricultural and energy products is to be announced to staff before the AGM and a set-piece strategy update on 8 May when investors will be seeking information about how Jenkins intends to bolster dividends paid to them. Barclays declined to comment but the expected move follows decisions by rivals, such as JP Morgan, to also pull back from an area where regulations are becoming tighter and profits falling sharply. Barclays' commodities operations reportedly employ 160 although it is not immediately clear how many of them be affected by the new plans. At next month's strategy day, Jenkins is expected to reveal whether he is further cutting back the investment bank which was built up by Diamond and his colleagues Jerry del Missier and Rich Ricci who have both left since. Jenkins has already incurred criticism after saying he needed to increase bonuses for 2013 to avoid a \"death spiral\" of investment bankers quitting to take up higher paid jobs at rivals. At the AGM, the bank could face a rebellion from as many as 40% of shareholders about its remuneration report, one of three votes on pay to be tabled at the meeting. Another will be on the pay policy of the bank \u2013 a new resolution ordered by business secretary Vince Cable from all major companies which allows investors to vote down bonus schemes for the coming three years. Another will be on the plan to allow Barclays to pay bonuses of two times salaries, a limit imposed by the European Union's new bonus rules.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne has a spring in his step. A well-received budget, a growing economy, a fighting chance of winning the election, the opportunity to stick it to his critics. If, as they say, revenge is a dish best served cold, the chancellor has been plating up a large helping in the past few weeks. But between now and the general election of 7 May 2015 so much could go wrong for David Cameron and his closest cabinet pal \u2013 a Blair/Brown partnership without the rivalry and suspicion \u2013 that Osborne must wake in a sweat at night thinking about it. It's not just the UK's fragile economic recovery, which could be knocked off course by renewed problems in any number of places, from the ailing eurozone to rising nationalist tensions in Asia, not to mention the new cold-war-style standoff over the integrity of Ukraine's borders. At home, Ukip's populist panaceas (\"quit Europe, end immigration\") enjoy rising popularity among disaffected Conservative voters who see the presiding duo as metropolitan posh boys; \"greedy elitists\" who don't know the price of milk. A symbolically damaging defeat in next month's European elections just might be followed by a \"yes\" vote on Scottish independence on 18 September, ensuring that the names Cameron and Osborne will be remembered chiefly for failing to save the Anglo-Scottish union of 1707 from destruction. For the man who encourages speculation that his is the bigger part of Downing Street's strategic political brain such an event would be catastrophic \u2013 even without the hovering presence of Boris Johnson, the Tories' cheerful Ronald Reagan wannabe. So Osborne would be wise to enjoy his burst of spring sunshine while it lasts. Since taking office in May 2010 he has endured a long, wet winter. Just this time last year, the chancellor was left squirming and furious in Washington when the IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, said he would be \"playing with fire\" if he failed to throttle back on austerity and provide more stimulus to the economy. The timing could hardly have been worse. After two dismal years, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) was about to pronounce on whether Britain had slipped into a triple-dip recession. That had not happened under Mrs Thatcher. It had not happened under James Callaghan in the grim 1970s when Opec quadrupled oil prices. It had not happened in the 1930s. Indeed, it had never happened, not even in the great deflation that followed the crash of 1873. And still hasn't. When the official data came out, the news was that in the first three months of 2013 the economy had started growing again. Not by much, but by enough to suggest that a corner had been turned. Even better, the number crunchers decided that there had not even been a double-dip recession, merely a period of unusually sluggish activity. For Osborne, it represented the turning of the tide. When he returned to Washington in bullish mood for this month's IMF meeting, there was no talk of him playing with fire. Indeed, the fund said the UK was likely to grow faster than any other G7 country this year. And the chancellor was more than willing to take on \"the deficit deniers\" and the \"growth deniers\" when he addressed a favourite rightwing thinktank, the American Enterprise Institute. \"The pessimists said our plan would not deliver economic growth. Now they say economic growth will not deliver higher living standards,\" Osborne said. \"They were wrong about the past and they are now wrong about the future. It's only by continuing to work through our longterm economic plan that we can deliver more economic security and a brighter future for all.\" But the success of the Osborne \"plan\" needs to be put into context. Britain's economic output \u2013 gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 has yet to return to pre-2008 levels. The recovery not only lags behind that in the US and Germany, but is even slower than that which followed the Great Depression of the 1930s. Living standards have taken a colossal hit as incomes (except at the very top) have failed \u2013 year after year \u2013 to keep pace with prices. In the US presidential election debate in 1980, Reagan said Americans should ask themselves whether they were better or worse off than when Jimmy Carter became president. Despite tentative evidence that real wages are again rising, Osborne will fail the Reagan test in 2015 by some distance, except in a few favoured professions and places. As elsewhere, inequality has become a major fact of life and political distress. Even so, the chancellor is confident voters will pay more heed at the general election to the performance of the economy in the final two years of the parliament than in the three preceding years. Miliband's stress on the \"cost of living\" crisis resonates with voters, but this weekend's YouGov poll for the Sunday Times \u2013 carried out after the better wage and unemployment figures \u2013 shows, to Labour's alarm, the gap between the parties narrowing. And voters blame the previous government, not the coalition, for the current period of austerity. Polls repeatedly show that Osborne and Cameron are far more widely trusted to run the economy than Ed Miliband and Ed Balls. One reason for that is that the chancellor was given a free run to set the terms of debate during his first months in office. With Labour holding a five-month-long leadership election in 2010, the record of Gordon Brown's government was relentlessly trashed. The aim was to implant the idea that the recession was not a global phenomenon caused by out-of-control banks, but by Labour's profligacy and failure \"to mend the roof while the sun was shining\". Given that both Cameron and Osborne had endorsed Labour's spending plans and light-touch regulations (\"not light enough!\") until after the disastrous collapse of Lehman Brothers in late 2008, this was chutzpah. But the cheeky strategy worked a treat. It was helped by the fact that Labour's electorate duly enthroned the Brownite Miliband, not his Blairite brother, David. Miliband and Balls (soon to be restored as shadow chancellor) were closely associated with key mistakes of Gordon Brown's decade at the Treasury and reluctant to acknowledge them. Only recently did Balls start admitting that, like US Federal Reserve chairman and Brown hero Alan Greenspan, they overrated the City's willingness to regulate its own reckless conduct. But phase two of Osborne's plan did not go so well as the effort to blame Labour. It involved a concept dubbed \"expansionary fiscal contraction\", the idea that austerity would enhance growth by generating a warm feeling among consumers and businesses that the government was balancing its books. Both investment in new capacity and jobs as well as spending in the shops would rise even as the Treasury was hacking away at the deficit. Part of the \"blame Labour\" campaign involved drawing ridiculous comparisons between Britain and crisis-stricken Greece. Even the new Lib Dem business secretary and unreconstructed Keynsian Vince Cable, whose warnings during the boom years had proved far wiser than Osborne's, joined in. That did not do much for fragile confidence. Osborne tackled Britain's deficit by cutting spending on infrastructure and welfare, and by putting up VAT to 20%. That slowed down the economy at precisely the time that Britain's main export market, the eurozone, was going into meltdown. When campaigning for the Labour leadership in the summer of 2010, Balls said Osborne's approach was \"wrong in its analysis of the past; reckless in its diagnosis of the current situation; and dangerous in its prescription for the future\". This analysis looked more and more perceptive as the economy crawled along for the next two years. But voters still mistrusted Balls's past record too much to take much notice. By the time of the 2012 budget, Conservative MPs were desperate for a package that would boost both growth and morale. What they got was the \"omnishambles\" budget, with its tax increases on pasties, caravans, cathedrals and grannies, but a cut in income tax for millionaires from 50p to 45p. Osborne did a U-turn on all but the last, but his reputation as a street-smart political brain took a serious hit as the tabloids savaged the \"pasty tax\" and much else. From here, the story gets a little messy. Osborne says he stuck to his plan; his critics say he quietly ditched it and moved on to \"plan B\". Certainly, the idea of sorting out the public finances within one five-year parliament went out of the window. So did the timetable for starting to reduce national debt as a share of GDP. Some of the cuts in capital spending were reversed, with a host of road and rail projects given the go-ahead on the grounds that they will boost growth. Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning US economist, puts it this way: \"So the UK government did a lot of austerity, then stopped doing more, and the economy began to grow thereafter. Does this vindicate expansionary austerity? To use an analogy I've used before, if I keep hitting myself in the head with a baseball bat, and then I stop, I will start to feel better; this doesn't mean that hitting yourself in the head with a baseball bat is a good thing.\" It was not only the deficit-reduction plan that was shelved. Osborne arrived in office determined to change the face of the economy. Britain had become a nation of spendthrifts (as Vince Cable repeatedly warned in the boom years), racking up too much private debt and too much government debt. Given the right incentives, including those controversial tax breaks, growth under the coalition would be skewed more towards investment and exports. Not for the first time in postwar British history, it hasn't worked that way, as Osborne recognised in last month's budget when he announced measures to boost investment and exports. He has talked tougher than he has acted, at least since his early days in office, and sought to address high levels of youth unemployment by cutting employers' national insurance contributions. The chancellor would also argue that his commitment to deficit reduction has won the government brownie points in the financial markets and provided the Bank of England with the freedom to boost activity through cheap borrowing and credit creation. Interest rates have been pegged at 0.5% for more than five years. Threadneedle Street has created \u00a3375bn in electronic money since 2009 by buying bonds in the process known as quantitative easing (QE). Banks were encouraged to lend to the mortgage market and home loans have been subsidised by Osborne's Help to Buy initiative. Yet lending remains sluggish and banks, not borrowers, have been the chief beneficiaries of cheap money. Pensioners' annuity rates on retirement have been dismal, prompting Osborne to say \"save, save, save\" in his March budget while simultaneously abolishing restrictions on how people spend their tax-subsidised pension pots. \"Spend, spend, spend\" was the subtext (on a foreign-made Lamborghini, if you wish). In their desperation and gratitude for a tabloid-friendly budget (tiny cuts in beer and petrol duty still generate corny tabloid headlines, 1960s-style), more fastidious Tory MPs averted their gaze and cheered the conjuring trick. By Christmas, Omnishambles Osborne had overtaken Balls for perceived economic competence. Last week Ipsos Mori reported him to be presiding over levels of economic optimism not seen since 1976, when Labour's lovable bruiser Denis Healey was battling his own IMF crisis. Yet, despite the froth and partisan pre-election press coverage, in the end it has been another familiar case of \"here's the new growth, same as the old growth\". Osborne is now presiding over a bog-standard British recovery built on a rising property market and more consumer debt. In the past 40 years, every housing boom has been followed by a housing bust. But there is always a sweet spot when growth is strong, inflation is low and Britons convince themselves of the four most dangerous words in economics: \"this time it's different\". If there is a reckoning, it won't come until after May 2015. Which is why Osborne thinks the election is his to lose. As with Brown, whom he resembles in office, every Osborne move has as much politics as economics in its making. But will the electorally calibrated policy shifts \u2013 such as Osborne's unlikely use of a speech in Tilbury this year to declare his goal is to become the \"full employment chancellor\" \u2013 actually work? Since 1945 many chancellors have aspired to move from No 11 to No 10, but only four have succeeded: Harold Macmillan in 1957, Jim Callaghan in 1976, John Major, the dark horse, in 1990, and, of course, Brown after his long wait in 2007. All had their moments of glory: Macmillan and Major even won elections. But all were ultimately tainted with failure and defeat. It is as if the two jobs require different skill sets: No 11 the gravitas, No 10 the showmanship and a feel for the public mood. No one disputes Osborne's influence. Once again, Cameron's recent reshuffle saw an Osborne man, Sajid Javid, promoted to cabinet rank after the chancellor reportedly gave Maria Miller the coup de grace. He was also credited with trying to lure Boris Johnson, his presumed chief rival for the leadership succession, back to Westminster at the 2015 election, widely seen as a precaution to dip the London mayor's hand in any defeat. Johnson, who routinely criticises the coalition from the safety of City Hall, duly invited Osborne and his cheerleader Michael Gove to a curry supper at home in Islington, to mend fences. But Johnson will not be standing in 2015. Either victory or defeat will be Cameron and Osborne's to enjoy. That is a gamble too. What if Cameron were to resign after losing the Scottish referendum by proxy in September? Could Osborne, who would never break with Cameron, succeed his pal then? It seems unlikely, since he \u2013 and his chosen Bank of England chief Mark Carney \u2013 would share much of the blame for \"going negative\" over not sharing sterling with an Alex Salmond-led state. Yet much stranger things have happened: in the doomed invasion of Suez in 1956 Harold Macmillan was \"first in, first out\", a colleague who ratted on the policy and benefitted. Callaghan, Major and Brown also engaged in some deft treachery on the way up. Yet Osborne's problem is surely deeper. His party finds him hard to love, the wider public even more so. After his four years in office, they still do not know what he really believes in. The CV is also not one that most voters warm to in a fiercely undeferential age. Born only in 1971, and chancellor at just 39, Osborne is the child of privilege, heir to a 17th-century Anglo-Irish baronetcy (he will one day be the 18th Sir George \u2013 formerly Gideon \u2013 Osborne). He was raised in a metropolitan, liberal atmosphere; his father's swish soft furnishing firm, Osborne and Little, has made him comfortably well off. Calling George \"oik\" because he only attended St Paul's School (founded 1509) may have been a good joke among Oxford's Bullingdon Club Etonians, but it does not make most people laugh in a world of rising inequality, one in which the chancellor, though far from banker-rich, seems to feel comfortable. So having his hair restyled (new adviser Thea Rogers, a former BBC political producer, gets the credit) and telling voters \"we're all in this together\" will not be enough to secure his future or his reputation. Voters are disaffected and suspicious of the very qualities in the political elite that Osborne embodies. His best hope lies not in himself, but in the weakness of his rivals. The two Eds are yet to persuade the public they are ready for office. Johnson may never shake off his image as a buffoon. Dazzling Alex Salmond may finally trip himself up once too often, and Ukip's Nigel Farage might prove to be a bad-tempered chancer \u2013 or worse. As with the fate of the British economy, the prospects may not be appetising, but they are what they are.",

Polls repeatedly show that Osborne and Cameron are far more widely trusted to run the economy than Ed Miliband and Ed Balls.</p> <p>One reason for that is that the chancellor was given a free run to set the terms of debate during his first months in office. With Labour holding a five-month-long leadership election in 2010, the record of Gordon Brown's government was relentlessly trashed. The aim was to implant the idea that the recession was not a global phenomenon caused by out-of-control banks, but by Labour's profligacy and failure \"to mend the roof while the sun was shining\".</p> <p>Given that both Cameron and Osborne had endorsed Labour's spending plans and light-touch regulations (\"not light enough!\") until after the disastrous collapse of Lehman Brothers in late 2008, this was chutzpah. But the cheeky strategy worked a treat. It was helped by the fact that Labour's electorate duly enthroned the Brownite Miliband, not his Blairite brother, David. Miliband and Balls (soon to be restored as shadow chancellor) were closely associated with key mistakes of Gordon Brown's decade at the Treasury and reluctant to acknowledge them. Only recently did Balls start admitting that, like US Federal Reserve chairman and Brown hero Alan Greenspan, they overrated the City's willingness to regulate its own reckless conduct.</p> <p>But phase two of Osborne's plan did not go so well as the effort to blame Labour. It involved a concept dubbed \"expansionary fiscal contraction\", the idea that austerity would enhance growth by generating a warm feeling among consumers and businesses that the government was balancing its books. Both investment in new capacity and jobs as well as spending in the shops would rise even as the Treasury was hacking away at the deficit.</p> <p>Part of the \"blame Labour\" campaign involved drawing ridiculous comparisons between Britain and crisis-stricken Greece. Even the new Lib Dem business secretary and unreconstructed Keynsian Vince Cable, whose warnings during the boom years had proved far wiser than Osborne's, joined in. That did not do much for fragile confidence. Osborne tackled Britain's deficit by cutting spending on infrastructure and welfare, and by putting up VAT to 20%. That slowed down the economy at precisely the time that Britain's main export market, the eurozone, was going into meltdown. When campaigning for the Labour leadership in the summer of 2010, Balls said Osborne's approach was \"wrong in its analysis of the past; reckless in its diagnosis of the current situation; and dangerous in its prescription for the future\". This analysis looked more and more perceptive as the economy crawled along for the next two years. But voters still mistrusted Balls's past record too much to take much notice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-435031237\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/21/1398092329066/Osborne-eating-a-pasty-af-001.jpg\" alt=\"Osborne eating a pasty after his notorious 'omnishambles' budget.\" width=\"220\" height=\"274\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Osborne eating a pasty after his notorious 'omnishambles' budget. Photograph: Apex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time of the 2012 budget, Conservative MPs were desperate for a package that would boost both growth and morale. What they got was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/16/omnipresent-unlikely-accolade\" title=\"\"> \"omnishambles\"</a> budget, with its tax increases on pasties, caravans, cathedrals and grannies, but a cut in income tax for millionaires from 50p to 45p. Osborne did a U-turn on all but the last, but his reputation as a street-smart political brain took a serious hit as the tabloids savaged the \"pasty tax\" and much else.</p> <p>From here, the story gets a little messy. Osborne says he stuck to his plan; his critics say he quietly ditched it and moved on to \"plan B\". Certainly, the idea of sorting out the public finances within one five-year parliament went out of the window. So did the timetable for starting to reduce national debt as a share of GDP. Some of the cuts in capital spending were reversed, with a host of road and rail projects given the go-ahead on the grounds that they will boost growth.</p> <p>Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning US economist, <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/the-return-of-expansionary-austerity/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">puts it this way</a>: \"So the UK government did a lot of austerity, then stopped doing more, and the economy began to grow thereafter. Does this vindicate expansionary austerity? To use an analogy I've used before, if I keep hitting myself in the head with a baseball bat, and then I stop, I will start to feel better; this doesn't mean that hitting yourself in the head with a baseball bat is a good thing.\"</p> <p>It was not only the deficit-reduction plan that was shelved. Osborne arrived in office determined to change the face of the economy. Britain had become a nation of spendthrifts (as Vince Cable repeatedly warned in the boom years), racking up too much private debt and too much government debt. Given the right incentives, including those controversial tax breaks, growth under the coalition would be skewed more towards investment and exports.</p> <p>Not for the first time in postwar British history, it hasn't worked that way, as Osborne recognised in last month's budget when he announced measures to boost investment and exports. He has talked tougher than he has acted, at least since his early days in office, and sought to address high levels of youth unemployment by cutting employers' national insurance contributions. The chancellor would also argue that his commitment to deficit reduction has won the government brownie points in the financial markets and provided the Bank of England with the freedom to boost activity through cheap borrowing and credit creation.</p> <p>Interest rates have been pegged at 0.5% for more than five years. Threadneedle Street has created \u00a3375bn in electronic money since 2009 by buying bonds in the process known as quantitative easing (QE). Banks were encouraged to lend to the mortgage market and home loans have been subsidised by Osborne's Help to Buy initiative. Yet lending remains sluggish and banks, not borrowers, have been the chief beneficiaries of cheap money.</p> <p>Pensioners' annuity rates on retirement have been dismal, prompting Osborne to say \"save, save, save\" in his March budget while simultaneously abolishing restrictions on how people spend their tax-subsidised pension pots. \"Spend, spend, spend\" was the subtext (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/20/pension-pots-used-lamborghinis-minister\" title=\"\">on a foreign-made Lamborghini, if you wish</a>).</p> <p>In their desperation and gratitude for a tabloid-friendly budget (tiny cuts in beer and petrol duty still generate corny tabloid headlines, 1960s-style), more fastidious Tory MPs averted their gaze and cheered the conjuring trick. By Christmas, Omnishambles Osborne had overtaken Balls for perceived economic competence. Last week Ipsos Mori reported him to be <a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/38/Satisfaction-With-The-Chancellor-since-1976.aspx?view=wide\" title=\"\">presiding over levels of economic optimism not seen since 1976</a>, when Labour's lovable bruiser Denis Healey was battling his own IMF crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-435031238\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/21/1398092082922/Osborne-and-his-arch-riva-011.jpg\" alt=\"Osborne and his arch-rival Boris Johnson in London in 2011.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Osborne and his arch-rival Boris Johnson in London in 2011. Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet, despite the froth and partisan pre-election press coverage, in the end it has been another familiar case of \"here's the new growth, same as the old growth\". Osborne is now presiding over a bog-standard British recovery built on a rising property market and more consumer debt. In the past 40 years, every housing boom has been followed by a housing bust. But there is always a sweet spot when growth is strong, inflation is low and Britons convince themselves of the four most dangerous words in economics: \"this time it's different\". If there is a reckoning, it won't come until after May 2015. Which is why Osborne thinks the election is his to lose.</p> <p>As with Brown, whom he resembles in office, every Osborne move has as much politics as economics in its making. But will the electorally calibrated policy shifts \u2013 such as Osborne's unlikely use of a speech in Tilbury this year to declare <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/mar/31/george-osbornes-speech-on-tax-and-welfare-politics-live-blog\" title=\"\">his goal is to become the \"full employment chancellor\"</a> \u2013 actually work? Since 1945 many chancellors have aspired to move from No 11 to No 10, but only four have succeeded: Harold Macmillan in 1957, Jim Callaghan in 1976, John Major, the dark horse, in 1990, and, of course, Brown after his long wait in 2007. All had their moments of glory: Macmillan and Major even won elections. But all were ultimately tainted with failure and defeat. It is as if the two jobs require different skill sets: No 11 the gravitas, No 10 the showmanship and a feel for the public mood.</p> <p>No one disputes Osborne's influence. Once again, Cameron's recent reshuffle saw an Osborne man, Sajid Javid, promoted to cabinet rank <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2601081/Osborne-pulls-strings-Miller-goes-Chancellor-livid-expenses-row-eclipsed-news-recovery.html\" title=\"\">after the chancellor reportedly gave Maria Miller the coup de grace</a>. He was also credited with <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dac98186-a2d0-11e3-9685-00144feab7de.html#axzz2zWC9n8Gg\" title=\"\">trying to lure Boris Johnson, his presumed chief rival for the leadership succession, back to Westminster</a> at the 2015 election, widely seen as a precaution to dip the London mayor's hand in any defeat. Johnson, who routinely criticises the coalition from the safety of City Hall, duly invited Osborne and his cheerleader Michael Gove to a curry supper at home in Islington, to mend fences.</p> <p>But Johnson will not be standing in 2015. Either victory or defeat will be Cameron and Osborne's to enjoy. That is a gamble too. What if Cameron were to resign after losing the Scottish referendum by proxy in September? Could Osborne, who would never break with Cameron, succeed his pal then? It seems unlikely, since he \u2013 and his chosen Bank of England chief Mark Carney \u2013 would share much of the blame for \"going negative\" over not sharing sterling with an Alex Salmond-led state. Yet much stranger things have happened: in the doomed invasion of Suez in 1956 Harold Macmillan was \"first in, first out\", a colleague who ratted on the policy and benefitted. Callaghan, Major and Brown also engaged in some deft treachery on the way up.</p> <p>Yet Osborne's problem is surely deeper. His party finds him hard to love, the wider public even more so. After his four years in office, they still do not know what he really believes in. The CV is also not one that most voters warm to in a fiercely undeferential age. Born only in 1971, and chancellor at just 39, Osborne is the child of privilege, heir to a 17th-century Anglo-Irish baronetcy (he will one day be the 18th Sir George \u2013 formerly Gideon \u2013 Osborne). He was raised in a metropolitan, liberal atmosphere; his father's swish soft furnishing firm, Osborne and Little, has made him comfortably well off. Calling George \"oik\" because he only attended St Paul's School (founded 1509) may have been a good joke among Oxford's Bullingdon Club Etonians, but it does not make most people laugh in a world of rising inequality, one in which the chancellor, though far from banker-rich, seems to feel comfortable.</p> <p>So having his hair restyled (new adviser Thea Rogers, a former BBC political producer, gets the credit) and telling voters \"we're all in this together\" will not be enough to secure his future or his reputation. Voters are disaffected and suspicious of the very qualities in the political elite that Osborne embodies. His best hope lies not in himself, but in the weakness of his rivals. The two Eds are yet to persuade the public they are ready for office. Johnson may never shake off his image as a buffoon. Dazzling Alex Salmond may finally trip himself up once too often, and Ukip's Nigel Farage might prove to be a bad-tempered chancer \u2013 or worse. As with the fate of the British economy, the prospects may not be appetising, but they are what they are.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Retailers suffered a drop in shopper numbers over the crucial Easter weekend, according to figures that deal a blow to hopes of a bounceback this month after a tough March. News that footfall in UK shops was down 1.9% on last Easter underscored the fragility of consumer confidence after years of squeezed incomes, according to the retail data company Springboard. Its figures, which count shoppers out and about and not actual sales, showed that shopping centres fared worst over the weekend while out-of-town retail parks \u2013 traditionally boosted by shopping for DIY products on bank holiday weekends \u2013 were the best-performing category. \"People are clearly still very nervous about spending and these figures reveal the fragility of the recovery. Easter weekend is the next big trading opportunity for retailers after Christmas and a huge opportunity, but even good weather was not enough to encourage people to go out and spend,\" said Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard. \"Though out-of-town locations are trading well, high streets and shopping centres have had a tough time this weekend, which is unexpected. I think it's a function of the fact that the recovery we are seeing in terms of the macro-economic indicators, such as rising employment and falling inflation, haven't yet filtered through enough for people to feel more confident,\" she said. The figures for Good Friday, Saturday and Easter Monday will be a particular disappointment to retailers given they compare with one of the coldest Easters on record in 2013. Springboard said that while retail park footfall was up 6.1% on Easter 2013, high streets saw a 3.5% drop and shopping centres suffered a 5.3% fall. There was, however, welcome news of a 2.4% pick-up for coastal towns after many were hurt by severe floods earlier in the year. The overall drop across all categories for the weekend was a reminder to retailers of the slow road ahead, said Wehrle. \"I wouldn't envisage the recovery in consumer spending is going to be imminent ... This period of economic uncertainty has gone on for a long time and almost become the norm,\" she said. The numbers cast doubt over whether retailers' forecasts of an Easter turnaround after a dire March will be realised. Official figures on March are not out till the end of this week, but the British Retail Consortium has already reported that its measure put like-for-like sales down 1.7% on March last year, when retailers benefited from an earlier Easter. That was the sharpest drop for a year but the trade group insisted the underlying trend on the high street was encouraging and that April would see shoppers back out in force to pick up their usual Easter holiday purchases such as children's clothes and furniture. Economists expect the numbers from the Office for National Statistics on Friday to show a slight dip in sales in March. The consensus forecast is for a 0.4% drop in sales volumes on the month after a 1.7% surge in February, according to a Reuters poll. Sales are expected to be up 3.8% on the year, after 3.7% annual growth in February. However, economists say the outlook for consumer spending is improving after official data last week confirmed wage growth had finally overtaken inflation after years of falling pay in real terms. \"The encouraging news for retailers \u2013 and for overall growth prospects \u2013 is that consumers' purchasing power should pick up over the coming months with inflation remaining muted and earnings growth strengthening, albeit likely relatively gradually,\" said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. But he cautioned against betting on a quick turnaround in spending. \"Given that consumers have faced a prolonged squeeze on their purchasing power, the ability and willingness of many people is likely to remain limited for some time to come,\" he said. Capital Economics has a more upbeat forecast for retail sales in March and expects volumes to come in unchanged from February. Its economists said: \"We think that retail sales volumes may have held broadly steady in March. This would leave them 1% higher in Q1 overall than in Q4, indicating that the consumer recovery still has plenty of momentum.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Three of Scotland's leading universities have quit the CBI employers' federation in protest at its decision to register as a formal anti-independence campaign for September's referendum. Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen universities said CBI Scotland's decision to designate itself a no campaign with the Electoral Commission clearly conflicted with their need to remain neutral in the independence debate. The resignations have intensified the controversy over the CBI's registration as a no campaigner, which came to light last Friday just over three weeks after it officially stated that it opposed independence. Over the weekend, government agencies, led by Scottish Enterprise and broadcaster STV, quit the CBI, damaging the organisation's reputation as a broad-based employers' group and reigniting a simmering feud between the CBI and the pro-independence movement. A University of Edinburgh spokesperson said: \"While the University of Edinburgh hosts debate from all sides in the discussion around Scottish independence, we have a strictly neutral position on the issue as an institution. We have therefore withdrawn from membership of CBI Scotland while they are officially backing one side in that debate.\" The University of Glasgow said: \"We have carefully considered the decision of CBI Scotland to register with the Electoral Commission and decided that in order to maintain our impartiality we must resign our membership forthwith.\" Aberdeen University said it also felt it would be inappropriate to remain a member, stating: \"The University of Aberdeen does not take an institutional position on the constitutional future of Scotland.\" The resignations from the CBI of Scottish Enterprise and the tourism agency VisitScotland were prompted by the Scottish government after a government spokesman said late last week that ministers expected public bodies to quit the CBI \"with immediate effect\". As other CBI members who back independence accused it of failing to canvass their views, STV said its status as a neutral public service broadcaster would be undermined by continuing its involvement with the CBI. Firms with strong pro-independence links quit immediately after the Electoral Commission registration came to light. Tony Banks, who chairs the pro-independence campaign Business for Scotland, withdrew his care home company Balhousie Care Group, followed quickly by the wave power firm Aquamarine Power, whose chief executive, Martin McAdam, has personally endorsed independence. Banks challenged the CBI to produce minutes or evidence to prove its membership had been properly consulted. \"The fact is that [the CBI] have not gone through a democratic process and discussed this with the membership,\" he said. Other organisations and universities are expected to follow suit by resigning over the coming days. Glasgow Caledonian University's executive board was due to discuss its reaction on , with the investment agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise also likely to quit. John Cridland, the CBI's director general, said he regretted any resignation from the organisation but insisted its stance reflected the views of the great majority of its members, who were represented on its Scottish council and consulted through meetings and direct discussions. \"I am very sad to lose Scottish university members. Education of our young people is vitally important to everyone in business, and I have greatly valued the contribution that Scottish universities have made to the CBI,\" he said. \"We are all in uncharted waters and recognise and respect that difficult decisions may need to be taken.\" He sought to defuse the row by insisting that registering with the Electoral Commission was largely a technical and legal step to protect it from breaching strict laws on spending limits during the official 16-week independence campaign. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme before the university resignations were announced, Cridland said: \"We have to operate within the law and the decision we took was that simply to do our normal activities on behalf of our members, including events and public statements between now and the referendum, we were advised that we needed to comply with the Electoral Commission's rules because we have a position on the issues. \"It is a compliance issue.\" He insisted the CBI had a right to take a role in the debate. \"We are not trying to campaign to influence the Scottish voter but we are a business organisation and on the business issues \u2013 jobs in Scotland, growth in Scotland, living standards in Scotland \u2013 we have a view,\" he said. \"We don't think the economic case for independence has been made and we think the economy in Scotland and the economy of the United Kingdom is stronger together.\" The CBI was given one small boost when Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, which has close links to the North Sea oil and engineering industries, said that while it did not approve of the decision to register as a no campaign, it saw no reason to resign. It said it would remain neutral on the referendum but added: \"The purpose of the university's membership of the CBI is to assist in developing links with potential business partners \u2026We are not in the CBI in order to address Scottish independence.\"",

      "body": "<p>Three of Scotland's leading universities have quit the CBI employers' federation in protest at its decision to register as a formal anti-independence campaign for September's referendum.</p> <p>Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen universities said CBI Scotland's decision to designate itself a no campaign with the Electoral Commission clearly conflicted with their need to remain neutral in the independence debate.</p> <p>The resignations have intensified the controversy over the CBI's registration as a no campaigner, which came to light last Friday just over three weeks after it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/26/independent-scotland-influence-eu-finland-cbi\" title=\"\">officially stated that it opposed independence</a>.</p> <p>Over the weekend, government agencies, led by Scottish Enterprise and broadcaster STV, quit the CBI, damaging the organisation's reputation as a broad-based employers' group and reigniting a simmering feud between the CBI and the pro-independence movement.</p> <p>A University of Edinburgh spokesperson said: \"While the University of Edinburgh hosts debate from all sides in the discussion around Scottish independence, we have a strictly neutral position on the issue as an institution. We have therefore withdrawn from membership of CBI Scotland while they are officially backing one side in that debate.\"</p> <p>The University of Glasgow said: \"We have carefully considered the decision of CBI Scotland to register with the Electoral Commission and decided that in order to maintain our impartiality we must resign our membership forthwith.\"</p> <p>Aberdeen University said it also felt it would be inappropriate to remain a member, stating: \"The University of Aberdeen does not take an institutional position on the constitutional future of Scotland.\"</p> <p>The resignations from the CBI of Scottish Enterprise and the tourism agency VisitScotland were prompted by the Scottish government after a government spokesman said late last week that ministers expected public bodies to quit the CBI \"with immediate effect\".</p> <p>As other CBI members who back independence accused it of failing to canvass their views, STV said its status as a neutral public service broadcaster would be undermined by continuing its involvement with the CBI.</p> <p>Firms with strong pro-independence links quit immediately after the Electoral Commission registration came to light.</p> <p>Tony Banks, who chairs the pro-independence campaign Business for Scotland, withdrew his care home company Balhousie Care Group, followed quickly by the wave power firm Aquamarine Power, whose chief executive, Martin McAdam, has personally endorsed independence.</p> <p>Banks challenged the CBI to produce minutes or evidence to prove its membership had been properly consulted. \"The fact is that [the CBI] have not gone through a democratic process and discussed this with the membership,\" he said.</p> <p>Other organisations and universities are expected to follow suit by resigning over the coming days. Glasgow Caledonian University's executive board was due to discuss its reaction on , with the investment agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise also likely to quit.</p> <p>John Cridland, the CBI's director general, said he regretted any resignation from the organisation but insisted its stance reflected the views of the great majority of its members, who were represented on its Scottish council and consulted through meetings and direct discussions.</p> <p>\"I am very sad to lose Scottish university members. Education of our young people is vitally important to everyone in business, and I have greatly valued the contribution that Scottish universities have made to the CBI,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We are all in uncharted waters and recognise and respect that difficult decisions may need to be taken.\"</p> <p>He sought to defuse the row by insisting that registering with the Electoral Commission was largely a technical and legal step to protect it from breaching strict laws on spending limits during the official 16-week independence campaign.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme before the university resignations were announced, Cridland said: \"We have to operate within the law and the decision we took was that simply to do our normal activities on behalf of our members, including events and public statements between now and the referendum, we were advised that we needed to comply with the Electoral Commission's rules because we have a position on the issues.</p> <p>\"It is a compliance issue.\"</p> <p>He insisted the CBI had a right to take a role in the debate. \"We are not trying to campaign to influence the Scottish voter but we are a business organisation and on the business issues \u2013 jobs in Scotland, growth in Scotland, living standards in Scotland \u2013 we have a view,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We don't think the economic case for independence has been made and we think the economy in Scotland and the economy of the United Kingdom is stronger together.\"</p> <p>The CBI was given one small boost when Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, which has close links to the North Sea oil and engineering industries, said that while it did not approve of the decision to register as a no campaign, it saw no reason to resign.</p> <p>It said it would remain neutral on the referendum but added: \"The purpose of the university's membership of the CBI is to assist in developing links with potential business partners&#xa0;\u2026We are not in the CBI in order to address Scottish independence.\"</p>",
