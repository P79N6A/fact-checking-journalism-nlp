      "bodyText": "The crisis at Sports Direct escalated once again on Monday as the retailer was rounded on by MPs during an urgent parliamentary debate and the company was deserted by some of its leading City cheerleaders. Former shadow business minister, Chuka Umunna, branded the retailer as \u201ca bad advert for British business\u201d and said it had \u201ca culture of fear in the workplace that we would not wish to see repeated elsewhere\u201d. At the same time, City hedge fund boss Crispin Odey, a leading Sports Direct investor who had previously called the retailer\u2019s founder Mike Ashley a genius, also turned on the billionaire. Odey said Ashley was \u201cdifficult to house train\u201d and described his authority over other Sports Direct directors as \u201cdangerous\u201d. HM Revenue and Customs is facing increasing pressure to launch an inquiry into the sportswear retailer following a Guardian investigation that revealed how thousands of Sports Direct workers were receiving hourly rates of pay effectively below the minimum wage. Undercover reporters found how thousands of the retailer\u2019s warehouse workers are subjected to an extraordinary regime of searches and surveillance, while local primary schoolteachers also told the Guardian that pupils can remain in school while ill \u2013 and return home to empty houses \u2013 as parents working at Sports Direct are too frightened to take time off work. Around \u00a3600m has been wiped off the value of the company in the last four trading days as the shares have tumbled 16%. With a 55% stake in the company the value of Ashley\u2019s personal fortune has taken a hit of \u00a3330m. In another difficult day for the company, which was last week described as a \u201cscar on British business\u201d by the Institute of Directors: The business minister, Nick Boles, praised the Guardian\u2019s reporting and then added to the pressure on HMRC by telling parliament that tax officials have the power to proactively investigate companies like Sports Direct if there is general concern about practices in the sector; Major Sports Direct shareholders said they would meet this week in a bid to put pressure on the company to beef up its boardroom. Boles was called to a parliamentary debate on the retailer\u2019s conduct after Umunna filed an urgent question asking why the tax authorities were not actively investigating the revelations in the Guardian\u2019s undercover report last week. Umunna said a request for an investigation has been made by Unite, but HMRC had told the union it was unable to act without direct complaints from workers, who are refusing to come forward for fear of losing their jobs. \u201cWe know enough about the practices at Sports Direct Plc to conclude this company is a bad advert for British business and one with a culture of fear in the workplace which we would not want to see repeated elsewhere,\u201d Umunna said. \u201cWhy cannot HMRC go ahead and carry out an investigation in this case?\u201d In response, Boles said HMRC can act proactively where there is a sector of concern and does not need necessarily to wait for a specific complaint. He also praised the Guardian\u2019s reporting, which uncovered the harsh working conditions at Sports Direct, saying: \u201cIn general, I don\u2019t often welcome an investigation by the Guardian newspaper, but in this case, I think it is absolutely vitally important that media organisations do investigate these things because the government is never going to be able to investigate every employer in the country. And if they can uncover things, then I can promise you the government will be sure to review their findings and enforce the law where necessary.\u201d Boles said he could not give an \u201cabsolute pronouncement\u201d about some of the practices associated with Sports Direct but stressed that \u201canything that counts as work must be compensated at least at the level of the minimum wage\u201d. In what appeared to be a pointed warning to Sports Direct and Ashley, Boles added: \u201cI don\u2019t care how famous an employer is. I don\u2019t care how well connected they are. I don\u2019t care, frankly, how much money they have made. They need to obey the law. If they don\u2019t obey the law, we will find them and disqualify directors if necessary.\u201d A Sports Direct official said: \u201cSports Direct believes it\u2019s in compliance with minimum wage regulations and takes its responsibilities extremely seriously.\u201d Temporary workers at its Shirebrook warehouse are mostly hired through agencies, which technically employ the staff. The Commons debate came on an afternoon when more of the retailer\u2019s shareholders broke ranks. Odey, a City grandee who had once been a major supporter of the company, said: \u201cI have every sympathy for [the Guardian\u2019s] expos\u00e9s. In the fund I manage, I have personally reduced our holding substantially over the course of this year. That is partly because of the company\u2019s problems in Austria and partly because Mike is a difficult animal to house train. \u201cI think he should address these issues, I really do. It\u2019s that old question of citizen versus subject. Do you have any obligation to your people and to the community in which you operate? In a strange way, Amazon are no different \u2013 they have more technology and use fewer people \u2013 but they don\u2019t do anything for the greater good. They are all part and parcel of the new capitalism, which is quite cut-throat in the way it does business.\u201d Odey said some of the responsibility for the working conditions at Sports Direct must lie with consumers: \u201cWe have to recognise consumers\u2019 desire for cheap shoes is how you end up with these problems. Shoppers need to understand that these prices are only possible because every cost has been analysed and reduced as far as it will go.\u201d He said that Ashley was very difficult to deal with and warned that investors should now be wary of the business: \u201cIt is very difficult as a shareholder to understand half the decisions Mike makes. He is not under any authority and that is dangerous. My experience with Ashley is that is quite hard to change him. I don\u2019t think anybody has any influence on Mike apart from Mike. All that happens is that he gets angrier if he comes under pressure and thus you end up with a board of people who are very loyal to him. I don\u2019t think there is anyone there who says, \u2018Mike you can\u2019t do that,\u2019 and thus as a shareholder you have to make sure your exposure is not too big.\u201d Odey\u2019s views were reiterated by other major shareholders in Sports Direct, who indicated that they had begun talks to oust directors from the company\u2019s board. A source at one large holder of Sports Direct shares said: \u201cThey certainly need new non-executives and better non-executives \u2026 There are lots of discussions going on in the background [between shareholders] and there will be discussions and we will see where they land. We talk to each other about very concerning situations and this certainly qualifies as one.\u201d The source said shareholders who had turned a blind eye to Sports Direct\u2019s governance problems when performance looked good were now starting to pay attention after the Guardian\u2019s revelations coincided with disappointing financial results and new doubts about Ashley\u2019s strategy. \u201cLast week\u2019s results made it harder not to be bothered,\u201d the shareholder said. \u201cWhen the numbers go the other way, people spot problems that have been there all along. The shareholder said investors would prefer to apply pressure behind the scenes but that they could try to force existing directors out by going public. \u201cIt\u2019s Ashley\u2019s business so it depends on the level of embarrassment that non-executive directors are willing to face. Maybe they are happy with that but I suspect some of them won\u2019t be.\u201d A source at another large fund manager said. \u201cThe board needs refreshment from the chairman down. The role of the chairman is going to be a focus for most investors.\u201d Despite the government\u2019s response in the Commons, the Treasury tried to block the debate by writing to the Speaker of the House of Commons to say the matter was \u201cnot urgent and should not be aired\u201d. This was overruled. The minister was urged by Conservative and Labour MPs alike to look into practices like those of Sports Direct. Marcus Fysh, Tory MP for Yeovil, criticised the \u201caggressive use and attitude to flexible working\u201d and called for ministers to consider a \u201cgeneral anti-avoidance rule when it comes to these employment laws\u201d. HMRC said it could not comment on individual companies but acknowledged officials were able to launch proactive investigations as well as ones in response to specific complaints by employees. \u201cHMRC investigate all direct complaints made by workers and considers all issues raised which may impact on whether a worker receives the full national minimum wage,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who believes they are not receiving the national minimum wage should contact Acas.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Accountancy watchdogs decided not to conduct a full investigation into the auditing of HBOS before they received all the information about the near-collapse of the bank, MPs have been told. During evidence given at the Treasury select committee on last month\u2019s report into HBOS, MPs were also told it was obvious that Andy Hornby, the former chief executive who now holds a senior role at bookmakers Gala Coral, should have been investigated. They also heard that Sir Hector Sants, the former boss of the Financial Services Authority, should bear responsibility for the narrow scope of the investigation which led to only Peter Cummings, the former head of the HBOS corporate bank, being banned and fined \u00a3500,000 in 2012. Andrew Green, the QC who scrutinised the decision by City regulators to only take action against Cummings, said: \u201cIn the circumstances where you have the CEO of a systemically important bank that fails \u2013 and is failing across multiple areas \u2026 it seems it\u2019s pretty obvious and in the public interest that he [Hornby] should have been investigated in early 2009.\u201d Last month, Green concluded it was in the public interest for regulators to widen their investigation beyond Cummings. Iain Cornish and Stuart Bernau, the two financial experts who acted as independent scrutinisers of the HBOS report, also expressed surprise that the accountancy body, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), had not investigated KMPG. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said he was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d after being told by Bernau that the FRC had taken the decision before it had all the evidence. Cornish said it showed a \u201clack of curiosity\u201d. Green blamed a \u201cperfect storm\u201d leading to the \u201cmisguided and wrong\u201d decision to investigate only Cummings. He said there had been \u201ca real concern within enforcement about losing cases\u201d. He also said it was \u201csomewhat unsatisfactory\u201d and not in the public interest that the City regulator had prevented him naming the four individuals who decided to focus only on Cummings. The four are named in his report as Ms Williams, Mr Johnson, Mr Smith and Mr Walker \u2013 none are real names. The FSA \u2013 whose responsibilities have since been handed to the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England \u2013 had argued that only senior individuals should be identified, Green said. According to Green\u2019s report, Sants had told FSA staff to take a tough stance when considering regulatory action against former HBOS officials but did not know that there were grounds for a full investigation into Hornby. \u201cSomebody was taking their eye off the ball,\u201d said Green, referring to the communication between Sants and the FSA\u2019s enforcement division.",

Even as the price of a barrel of oil fell close to an 11-year low on Monday, the chief executive of Shell indicated, for the umpteenth time, that his group\u2019s proposed \u00a340bn takeover of BG Group will proceed as planned. His cue was a thumbs-up from China, the final regulator to pronounce favourably. \u201cThis is a strategic deal that will make Shell a more profitable and resilient company in a world where oil and gas prices could remain lower for some time,\u201d said Van Beurden. \u201cWe will now seek approval from both sets of shareholders as we move towards deal completion in early 2016.\u201d Not everyone is convinced. David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life, told the BBC the takeover did not make financial sense at the current oil price. Shell is paying too much. In Cumming\u2019s view, there are three possibilities: Shell walks away, agreeing to pay the \u00a3750m break fee; it seeks improved terms from BG; or shareholders vote against. Cumming didn\u2019t actually say Standard Life would vote against itself, which is a sign of the delicate politics at play. If Shell were to lose a shareholder poll on a \u00a340bn acquisition, the result would be taken as a vote of no confidence in the board. Heads would have to roll. That is why, if Van Beurden is sufficiently bloody minded, he could probably prevail. Institutional shareholders rarely rebel against giant companies on matters of confidence. But he would be unwise to push matters that far. Whatever he says in public now, he ought to be examining the option of renegotiation. The outlook in the market has transformed since the original terms were agreed in April, when oil fetched $65 a barrel. These days, the world is running out of places to store excess supplies. BG\u2019s shareholders are getting the better end of this deal by far. It\u2019s no use Shell arguing that the equity component in the terms mean \u201cboth sets of shareholders share the benefits of the combination in any expected oil price environment\u201d. That is true only up to a point. The terms also include cash of 383p a share \u2013 indeed, that is now worth almost 40% of the offer price, reflecting the fall in value of Shell\u2019s shares. It would, of course, be embarrassing for Van Beurden to attempt to secure better terms at this late stage. But embarrassment should not enter the equation. The best reason to pick up the phone is simple: in the current climate, BG\u2019s board would surely have to agree to talk. Spotlight must return to HBOS\u2019s auditors As the sorry tale of the failure of HBOS in 2008 is examined afresh, one actor in the drama has avoided the spotlight \u2013 KPMG, the bank\u2019s auditors. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the accountancy watchdog, looked into HBOS\u2019s provisioning for bad loans in its corporate lending division and decided KPMG had no case to answer. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, has been critical of that decision since it was made, calling it a \u201cserious mistake\u201d. On Monday, he was left \u201cflabbergasted\u201d on being told that the FRC didn\u2019t even wait for the official report on HBOS before reaching its conclusion. There was a \u201clack of curiosity\u201d at the FRC, reported Iain Cornish, adviser to the committee. That is damning stuff for FRC, whose credibility rests on being seen to make its rulings transparently and in full possession of the facts.

A Man\u2019s man \u2013 but what else is on Livingston\u2019s agenda? Ian Livingston, the chief executive who helped haul BT off its knees and then quit to join the coalition government as trade minister, is a chap who might expect to resume life on the corporate merry-go-round in a senior saddle \u2013 the chairmanship of a decent-sized FTSE 100 company, say. In fact, Lord Livingston is set to chair Man Group, which is still a large hedge fund, even after the 2012-14 upsets with its trend-following black box, but is in no immediate danger of re-joining the FTSE 100. He is a good high-profile hire for Man, which is looking to attract investors in the US and Asia, but it\u2019s harder to see the appeal from Livingston\u2019s point of view. There\u2019s the chance to chew the cud with Man\u2019s brainy multimillionaires, but that\u2019s about it.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Concerns are growing over the future of Rolls-Royce after it emerged the government has drawn up contingency plans to nationalise part of the power systems engineering firm if the crisis facing it worsens. Shares in Rolls fell on Monday as investors digested reports that the government could nationalise the company\u2019s nuclear submarine business or force it to merge with defence manufacturer BAE Systems. Analysts played down the prospect of either deal taking place, but the fact that the government, one of Rolls\u2019 biggest customers, is contemplating these options highlights how concerned it is about the FTSE 100 engineer. The government holds a golden share in Rolls which allows it to block a takeover by a foreign bidder and restrict any foreign investor from holding more than 15% of the company\u2019s shares. This restriction has become increasingly relevant because ValueAct, an activist investor based in California, has built a 10% stake in Rolls and is pushing for a seat on the company\u2019s board. Rolls is under pressure after issuing five profit warnings in less than two years. The company\u2019s share price has fallen by almost 40% this year as it struggles against government cuts to defence spending, the falling oil price and weakening demand for the wide-bodied commercial aircraft Rolls makes engines for. The government contingency plans are in case the performance of Rolls weakens further. The plans, first reported by the Financial Times, include taking control of the arm of the business that powers Britain\u2019s nuclear submarines. This would potentially allow a foreign investor to either acquire Rolls or pump emergency funds into the company by buying a stake larger than 15% without national security being compromised. Another option would be to merge the nuclear division of Rolls, or the whole company, with BAE. Both companies are a key part of the project to build new nuclear submarines to replace the UK\u2019s Trident programme. Sir Vince Cable, the former business secretary, said the government should consider buying its own stake in Rolls. Cable told Sky News that \u201canything which fundamentally threatens to diminish the value of Rolls-Royce could be a trigger for the government to take a stake\u201d. Analysts said the government was conducting a \u201csensible\u201d review of its plans to replace Trident, which will cost \u00a331bn, and that Rolls was still financially robust. Sandy Morris, analyst at Jefferies, said Rolls was investing \u00a3750m a year in research and development and \u00a3600m on new infrastructure. He added: \u201cI think the government being totally on top of Trident, and how they\u2019re going to manage it and the supply chain, is only sensible.\u201d Howard Wheeldon, an independent analyst, said: \u201cTo suggest that nationalisation is even a thought process in the minds of anyone currently, let alone that it may become a possible issue, is irresponsible in the extreme. \u201cYes, Rolls-Royce may have a US shareholder breathing down its neck, and that [ValueAct] has been reported as wishing to see parts of the group hived off. \u201cI doubt that will occur and I very much hope that it will not. The sum of the parts is what makes Rolls-Royce what it is and provides it with global strength.\u201d Shares in Rolls closed down 2.63% at 537.50p on Monday. A Rolls spokesperson said: \u201cWe are in contact with government as a matter of routine and regularly keep them updated on our performance and progress.\u201d",

Cable told Sky News that \u201canything which fundamentally threatens to diminish the value of Rolls-Royce could be a trigger for the government to take a stake\u201d.</p> <p>Analysts said the government was conducting a \u201csensible\u201d review of its plans to replace Trident, which will cost \u00a331bn, and that Rolls was still financially robust.</p> <p>Sandy Morris, analyst at Jefferies, said Rolls was investing \u00a3750m a year in research and development and \u00a3600m on new infrastructure. He added: \u201cI think the government being totally on top of Trident, and how they\u2019re going to manage it and the supply chain, is only sensible.\u201d</p> <p>Howard Wheeldon, an independent analyst, said: \u201cTo suggest that nationalisation is even a thought process in the minds of anyone currently, let alone that it may become a possible issue, is irresponsible in the extreme. </p> <p>\u201cYes, Rolls-Royce may have a US shareholder breathing down its neck, and that [ValueAct] has been reported as wishing to see parts of the group hived off. </p> <p>\u201cI doubt that will occur and I very much hope that it will not. The sum of the parts is what makes Rolls-Royce what it is and provides it with global strength.\u201d</p> <p>Shares in Rolls closed down 2.63% at 537.50p on Monday.</p> <p>A Rolls spokesperson said: \u201cWe are in contact with government as a matter of routine and regularly keep them updated on our performance and progress.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of unbuilt flats and apartments could come back on to the London property market over the next two years as foreign investors seek to cut their losses, according to a new study. In their latest report on the residential market, researchers at estate agent Cluttons said a large volume of newbuild stock was flowing on to the off-plan resales market, \u201cas buyers, particularly those of an international flavour, try to exit the market as currency advantages, especially for those from emerging markets, fade\u201d. Cluttons\u2019 head of research, Faisal Durrani, said he had seen figures suggesting 60,000 residential properties were due to be finished in London during 2016 and 2017, and said that about half of these were likely to be owned by overseas investors who would return them to the market. As the pound has strengthened against other currencies, London property has started to look much less attractive to overseas investors. Durrani said that since the last market peak in the summer of 2007, the cost of a London property has increased by almost a third for Malaysian investors and two-thirds for investors buying into the market from India. Overseas investors in some countries have also been hit by falling oil and commodity prices, which have reduced the amount they have to spend. A year ago the Guardian reported on an unfinished apartment in Battersea power station being sold on at a huge profit, while during 2015 the number of properties being \u201cflipped\u201d seems to have picked up. A search on property website Zoopla shows more than 400 properties specifically listed with the term \u201cresale\u201d, including a three-bedroom apartment within One Blackfriars due to be completed in spring 2018 on for just under \u00a33m, and a one-bedroom flat in Kensington for \u00a31.7m which will not be built until summer 2016. However, Durrani said he did not think that the homes were being sold to cash in but to break even. \u201c[In particular it\u2019s] developments that are not yet out of the ground and are still a year or two from completion. There\u2019s no income stream yet and breaking even is probably the best they could hope for.\u201d He said a lot of newbuild properties were flowing on to the buy-to-let market in the capital, which meant competition for rents was fierce. \u201cFor the first 11 months of the year the total number of renewals we saw was 25% higher than last year \u2013 because rents are remaining unchanged tenants are staying put.\u201d Property price growth in London\u2019s most expensive neighbourhoods has slowed over the past year, and the latest index from another estate agent, Knight Frank, showed a 0.3% drop in October, bringing the annual rate of growth down to just 0.9%. Investors were hit by stamp duty changes in 2014\u2019s autumn statement which added to the upfront cost of buying a property costing more than \u00a3937,400. From April 2016, buyers of second homes will face an additional charge, which will add a three percentage point surcharge to tax bills. Durrani said this would be seen as an \u201cirritant rather than a deterrent\u201d by potential buyers determined to secure a London residential investment asset. The Cluttons report suggests a bigger risk to the top end of the property market lies in the EU referendum in 2017. \u201cShould the UK vote to leave the EU, the impact on GDP growth and the value of sterling is likely to be quite substantial, with both likely to come under significant downward pressure,\u201d it said. \u201cFurthermore, the ending of free labour movement from the EU may curb demand in both the sales and lettings markets as the rate of household creation is likely to dip.\u201d In their latest monthly report, researchers at Knight Frank said they believed the latest changes to stamp duty would not have a big impact on the market. London \u201cwas in the middle of the pack compared to other major global cities in relation to prime property tax and holding costs\u201d, it said, and the changes \u201cappear unlikely to alter this position materially\u201d. However, Ed Mead, executive director of estate agency Douglas &amp; Gordon, said investors had been pulling out since the latest stamp duty announcement. \u201cSadly many who invest in newbuilds will rightly feel that they are being unfairly targeted and will withdraw from sales,\u201d he said. \u201cCurrency is an issue but this is one step too far.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It was another volatile day for investors, with oil prices hitting new seven year lows and Brent crude coming close to its lowest since 2004 before making a recovery. Traders were also nervous about the prospect of the US Federal Reserve agreeing the first interest rate rise for nearly a decade when it meets later this week. So the closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 78.72 points or 1.32% at 5874.06 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.94% to 10,139.34 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.68% lower at 4473.07 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.42% to 20,506.56 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 2.1% at 9428.5 But in Greece, the Athens market added 2.07% to 590.26 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recovered from its early falls and it currently up 21 points or 0.14%. Brent crude, having fallen as low a $36.33 a barrel, is now up 0.6% at $38.16. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Leading shares in London have closed at a three year low after the continuing plunge in the oil price, and nervousness ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting. The final scores showed the FTSE 100 down 1.3% at 5874.06, its lowest level since early December 2012. Markets are still under pressure ahead of this week\u2019s US Federal Reserve meeting, as oil prices remain weak. With Brent crude now down 1.7% at $37.27, the FTSE 100 has now lost 1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 100 points or 0.6% Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG said: Oil prices continue to dominate trading, with the FTSE 100 exhibiting major volatility and unpredictability in a largely mixed session today. Arguably, the correlation between oil prices and the FTSE is as strong as it ever has been, and with oil breaking towards multi-year lows, this is not a good sign for stocks. The positive influence felt by strong Chinese data overnight is all but forgotten by now, and instead the feeling is that markets are nervously preparing for the Fed decision. For that reason, the choppiness seen today could provide a format for future trading as we head into Wednesday\u2019s announcement. If the UK votes to leave the European Union, it would have a moderately negative effect on its credit rating, according to Fitch. The agency said: [A vote to leave would raise] risks to [the UK\u2019s] medium-term growth and investment prospects, its external position, and the future of Scotland within it. Longer term, the economic impact of leaving the EU is highly uncertain, but the impact on the rating dynamics would be less pronounced as many of the UK\u2019s key rating fundamentals would remain intact assuming UK-EU trade relations are not meaningfully disrupted. We forecast the UK referendum on EU membership to be held in the second half of 2016 following negotiations around the UK government\u2019s proposals for reform. Our baseline is that the UK will remain in the EU, but the risk of \u201cBrexit\u201d is significant. We expect the UK to be able to secure a deal reforming the terms of its EU membership. But there is a risk that the government may not get agreement to restrict \u201cin-work\u201d and family benefits for EU nationals working in the UK. It would then be harder for the pro-EU campaign to rally around the call to stay in a \u201creformed Europe\u201d. The often unpredictable nature of such referendums means there is a significant possibility that the vote will tip towards Brexit and lead to short-term volatility in financial markets. Market turbulence need not have any sovereign ratings impact, but how Brexit would be achieved is highly uncertain and the negotiations could be lengthy and complicated. This would raise at least three key risks from a ratings perspective. The full report is here: Fitch: Brexit Vote Would Be Moderately Credit Negative for UK Well that didn\u2019t last long. After a reasonable opening, US shares are trading lower as the oil price continues to slide towards eleven year lows. Added to that there has been some volatility on the S&amp;P 500, supposedly due to high frequency trading. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 49 points or 0.2%, the FTSE 100 has fallen 0.8% and Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.7%. As for oil, Brent crude is down around 2% at $37 a barrel, now far off its 11 year intra-day low. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Whilst not at its 4% nadir, a 2% drop for Brent crude has continued to weigh on the markets this Monday, pushing the previously positive global indices into the red as the day wore on. Given the state of oil, and the gradually deepening shade of red in its commodity sector as a whole, it is fairly remarkable that the FTSE is only down by around 50 points at this point in time instead of facing a hefty 3 digit decline. The Eurozone indices were just as bad as the FTSE this Monday afternoon despite the morning\u2019s solid industrial data. Whilst the relative lack of news has allowed commodities to rule this Monday, Tuesday presents a much busier schedule and, with it, a different set of problems. Inflation data is set to dominate, with the UK and US both revealing their latest figures. The US number is the more important of the two; expected at 0.0% against 0.2% last month, any dramatic movement downwards (however unlikely) could throw a spanner in the works ahead of Wednesday\u2019s FOMC meeting. As that is the other reason Tuesday could be difficult; pre-Fed jitters have already added to today\u2019s tricky trading, and with the proximity of that potential rate-hike growing ever closer investors\u2019 nerves are only likely to intensify. Here\u2019s an interesting table from M&amp;G\u2019s retail bond team comparing the economic situation the last time the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates to the position now: Meanwhile in the currency markets, sterling has hit a seven week low against the euro at 72.79p as the single currency gained ground across the board. Despite the concern about the falling oil price, it should not have too great an effect on the global economy, according to Capital Economics. It said: The latest slide in the price of crude oil is clearly unsettling the financial markets, but it should not materially affect the prospects for the global economy. Even if prices remain below $40 per barrel, this would not prevent inflation from rebounding next year. What\u2019s more, as the latest slide mainly reflects developments on the supply side, the fall in oil prices is not a signal of weakening economic activity... In contrast to the dip in August, which was driven by concerns about the impact of developments in China on the demand for oil, the latest slide is largely due to the inability of OPEC to agree any formal target for supply. The recent fall in oil prices is not, therefore, a sign of renewed fears about global growth, let alone an indication that the world is slipping back into recession. What\u2019s more, we do not expect oil prices to drop much further, or at least not for very long...In short, cuts in non-OPEC supply and stronger demand should support a gradual recovery over the coming years. If, however, we turn out to be wrong and Brent remains below $40 a barrel, the impact on global inflation would not be huge. The upshot is that inflation should rise sharply in advanced economies even if oil settles around its current level. As energy typically accounts for 10% of the CPI in advanced economies, a rebound in energy price inflation from -10% to zero would raise the headline rate by around one percentage point. This increase would be more gradual, and the peak a bit lower, if oil prices do not recover, but it is still coming. Central banks will not change course simply because headline inflation looks likely to rise a bit more slowly than they had anticipated, as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored and core price pressures continue to build. Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s key US interest rate decision and amid oil prices sliding towards 11 year lows, the American stock market has managed to open on a positive note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 50 points of 0.2% in early trading, giving some support to European markets, which are off their lows of the day. The FTSE 100 is up 0,2%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.3% and France\u2019s Cac virtually unchanged. Don\u2019t panic! So says David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, to investors who are flapping about the prospect of a US rate rise on Wednesday night. He is urging people to \u2018under-react\u2019 to any market \u2018over-reaction\u2019 this week if the Federal Reserve hikes (as appears likely). Kelly argues that the US economic fundamentals are improving: This week sees the release of the November CPI report which could show core CPI inflation rising to 2.0% year-over-year. A strong report on Housing Starts on Wednesday should offset weaker reports on manufacturing in the shape of the Industrial Production numbers for November and the Empire State and Philly Fed Indices for December. Flash Markit PMI numbers for the Eurozone, the U.S. and Japan should show more stability in manufacturing and more growth in services. Meanwhile, Unemployment Claims on Thursday should remain well below 300,000, indicating a still-tightening labor market. \u201cIf the numbers pan out this way, it will confirm that the U.S. economy is clearly healthy enough for the Fed to begin tightening. Time for a recap of the key points so far: A volatile morning\u2019s trading in Europe has seen the oil price come close to hitting an 11-year low, as investors brace for a historic US rate rise this week. Brent crude has tumbled by 4% to $36.42, on the brink of falling through the the levels last seen in December 2008. US crude oil has slipped below the $35/barrel mark, hitting a new seven-year low. Traders blame fears of a supply glut, with Iran expected to accelerate its pumping in 2016 as sanctions are lifted. That adds to ongoing angst over Opec\u2019s failure to curb production at its meeting 10 days ago. After a decent start, European stock markets have lost ground. Investors are fretting about the oil rout - and the prospect of the US central bank hiking interest rates on Wednesday, for the first time in almost a decade. This follows a solid selloff in Asia, where Australia\u2019s stock market fell 2% and a gauge of emerging market shares hit a six-year low. Economists are urging the Federal Reserve to act carefully when it meets this week; a US rate rise could hurt fragile economies worldwide. Market turbulence continues to rock the junk bond market. Bloomberg reports that a fund named Lucidus has liquidated its positions, following several other funds who have been hit by falling demand for high-yield assets in recent weeks. Elsewhere.... One of the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governors is refusing to vote to raise UK interest rates until wage growth appears sustainable. The chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland has predicted that UK borrowing costs will remain at record lows next year. South Africa\u2019s currency has rebounded after prime minister Jacob Zuma chose a new finance minister, for the second time in five days. And ECB president Mario Draghi has repeated his pressure on eurozone governments to reform. He also reiterated that the eurozone\u2019s central bank could take more action to fight deflation if necessary. The slump in the oil price is going to drag on inflation rates, and make central banks even more nervous about tightening monetary policy. Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank, believes it will prevent the Fed from hiking rates more than twice next year (assuming we get a rate rise on Wednesday): The recent fall in oil prices should only increase the deflationary forces at work in the US, which have created a noticeable outlook divergence between the Fed and the market. We are at the dovish-end of the spectrum calculating only two 25bp hikes in 2016, bringing the target range for the Fed Funds rate to 0.75 - 1.00% by year-end. Brent crude is now down 4%! This is pushing the cost of a barrel of North Sea oil very close to the financial-crisis-era low of $36.20, set in late December 2008. US crude oil is also weakening further, down over 2.5% today at $34.68 per barrel. The sight of the oil price falling another 3% today, towards its post-crisis lows, is causing alarm in the markets. The Financial Times has a good quote: \u201cThe year is ending on an uncomfortable note. The smell of fear is back in the air,\u201d said David Hufton at London-based broker PVM. Hufton added that Opec\u2019s failure to cut production this month is continuing to drive the oil price down and down: \u201cThe dam has collapsed and prices are in free fall with devastating consequences.\u201d This morning\u2019s rally in European markets has fizzled out, dragged down by energy firms and commodity producers. All the main indices are now in the red, led by a 1% slide in Frankfurt: The latest tumble in the oil price has send BP and Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s shares down around 1.8%. Mining firms are also hurting, with Glencore leading the FTSE fallers, down 2.3% The Bank of England have uploaded Minouche Shafik\u2019s new speech on interest rate policy: Treading carefully - speech by Minouche Shafik It includes a chart showing how UK drivers delayed replacing their tyres when the financial crisis struck, and haven\u2019t changed their behaviour since (teeing up a \u2018tyre tread gag\u2019....) Minouche Shafik, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has begun speaking at the Institute of Directors\u2019 HQ in London. And Shafik is sounding rather dovish, telling her audience that she will not vote for an interest rate rise until she is convinced wage growth has recovered. She says: In deciding how to vote in monetary policy meetings each month, I look across a wide range of indicators. There are many signs that the economy is normalising - the labour market is tightening, consumption growth is solid, investment is recovering, and even productivity growth is showing tentative signs of a return. And although the downward pressure on inflation from movements in energy prices and the exchange rate are proving persistent, they will not have a permanent effect on inflation. But, there is residual uncertainty about the relationship between the real economy and inflation \u2013 something economists refer to as \u2018model uncertainty\u2019 - which in this instance augurs for caution in setting monetary policy. The most likely outcome is that wage growth will soon resume its recovery, but there are alternative states of the world in which it takes longer for that to happen. So I judge it prudent to tread carefully, and refrain from voting for an increase in Bank Rate until I am convinced that wage growth will be sustained at a level consistent with inflation returning to target. That may back up RBS chief executive Ross McEwan\u2019s prediction that UK interest rates won\u2019t rise in 2016 at all (as covered here). Here\u2019s Katie Allen\u2019s news story on Shafik\u2019s speech: Yup, missed this one: Brent crude is also caught up in the oil selloff, hitting a new near-seven-year low today. It\u2019s currently down 3% to $36.78, only half a dollar above the low hit in February 2009. The turmoil in the junk bond market (see earlier) has apparently claimed another victim. Bloomberg is reporting that Lucidus Capital Partners has liquidated its positions, and returning funds to clients. Lucidus was set up in 2009, when it raised $500m to invest in high-yield bonds. Like many in the sector, it has suffered from falling prices and growing anxiety over the sector. Bloomberg\u2019s Christine Harper explains: \u201cThe fund has exited all investments,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Christon Burrows and Chief Investment Officer Geoffrey Sherry said in the statement obtained by Bloomberg. \u201cWe would like to thank our investors and counterparties for their support over the years.\u201d A redemption notice from a significant investor in October triggered Lucidus\u2019s decision to start winding down the portfolio and shedding staff, according to a person familiar with the fund\u2019s operations, who asked not to be identified speaking about internal deliberations. Oil is also suffering from the strengthening US dollar (which pushes down the cost of commodities priced in dollars). Investors are anticipating receiving higher returns on US dollar holdings once the Fed raises borrowing costs. The oil price has lurched through another milestone, as the selloff gathers pace. US crude oil just traded hands at $34.99 per barrel, a new near-seven year low. As explained earlier, oil is being hit by oversupply worries and anxiety over the likely US interest rate rise on Wednesday. Over in Bologna, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is repeating his traditional call for eurozone governments to reform their economies and their monetary union. In a well-worn refrain, Draghi is urging politicians to do more to tackle problems in the euro area, and pointed to the bad loans still sitting on some bank balance sheets. Here\u2019s a flavour: Investment has been held back in the euro area by three things: weak demand dynamics, the still-high private debt overhang and fragile private sector confidence. The euro area today needs to take additional steps, alongside supporting demand, to address the debt overhang and fragile confidence. Structural reforms are key to this end. It is clear that, in some countries, the large stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) is still preventing a stronger recovery in credit. All this explains why facilitating a work-out of NPLs has to be part of the package of policy actions to restore productive investment. The ongoing work towards a Capital Market Union (CMU) is an opportunity to accelerate progress also on this front. If we are to truly underpin confidence, it is important that, even while dealing with more pressing priorities, we do not lose sight of the need to complete our monetary union. Draghi also added that the ECB has all the tools it needs to bring inflation back up to target. If we need to intensify the use of those tools, we will do, he adds. That\u2019s a nod to investors who were disappointed that the ECB didn\u2019t announce a bigger injection of stimulus measures 10 days ago, at its latest meeting. Thousands of oil workers at Royal Dutch Shell and BG face an uncertain Christmas. Shell has just told the City that it expects to cut around 2,800 jobs once its \u00a347bn takeover of BG has been completed. That\u2019s around 3% of the total company. The layoffs will come after Shell has conducted a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of the joint company\u2019s operations in the UK. It is planning \u201coffice footprint rationalisation\u201d - which is code for back office closures and cutbacks. The move means that the merger will cost at least 10,000 jobs. Shell explains: These reductions are in addition to the previously announced plans to reduce Shell\u2019s headcount and contractor positions by 7,500 globally. The proposed changes are subject to deal completion, engagement with affected employees and relevant employee representatives. Further detailed work will be undertaken on the details of the proposed operational and administrative restructuring as part of ongoing integration planning. European stock markets are holding onto their early gains, while the oil price has hit a new seven-year low. The FTSE 100 is still up around 31 points, or 0.5%, while France\u2019s CAC is the standout performer, up 1.1%. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, market analyst at London Capital Group, says: \u201cRisk sentiment is rather good at the start of this year\u2019s last Fed-focus-week.\u201d Sentiment in the energy market remains subdued, though. Brent crude has fallen by 1.3% this morning, meaning a barrel of oil from the North Sea costs just $37.41. That\u2019s only $1.20 above the lows hit in 2009: That follows those reports that Iran is pumping more oil, in preparation for the easing of sanctions (see 8.02am for details) which is adding to concerns of a major supply glut in 2016. This chart shows how the selloff in junk bonds (or \u2018high-yield\u2019 assets) has already hurt investors this year. It would probably be better to describe junk bonds as \u2018higher yield\u2019 rather than \u2018high yield\u2019 these days, though. Investors have driven down the yield (or interest rate) on sub-investment grade bonds in a dash to buy assets that actually delivered a return (given that safer assets such as short-dated German bonds now have a negative yield). The head of Royal Bank of Scotland has predicted that UK interest rates will remain at their record lows for another year. In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Ross McEwan said he doesn\u2019t expect the Bank of England to hike anytime soon . McEwan said: I think the interest rates in the U.K. will stay low for longer..... I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be moving in 2016. So we\u2019re building our business around the fact that they won\u2019t be moving. And if they do move, that\u2019s nice to see. But it I think you\u2019ve got to build your business around some of the -- not the worst case scenarios but the scenarios that don\u2019t leave you, you know, hoping that something will happen. In a wide-ranging interview, McEwan also said that the task of restructuring RBS\u2019s investment bank was \u201cvery well advanced\u201d - seven years after the bank was almost sunk in the financial crisis. He also argued that he has to be \u201cpragmatic\u201d about paying bonuses to bankers - despite moves to cut City remuneration bills.

Industrial production across the Eurozone jumped by 1.9% year-on-year in October, according to data just released. Output was 0.6% higher compared with September, reversing a 0.3% decline, and suggesting that European firms saw stronger demand during October. Firms reported that demand for \u2018durable\u2019 consumer products was strong, followed by \u2018capital goods\u2019 (machinery and equipment). Eurostat explains: The increase of 1.9% in industrial production in the euro area in October 2015, compared with October 2014, is due to production of durable consumer goods rising by 4.2%, capital goods by 3.5%, intermediate goods by 1.5%, non-durable consumer goods by 0.7% and energy by 0.2%. Over in Greece, the government is launching a new push to get its austerity programme approved by MPs, to unlock more bailout funds. The Athens parliament is expected to vote on various measures on Tuesday night, including unpopular privatisations and new rules to tackle bad debts. It could be a bruising vote for Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s prime minister, who now only holds a majority of three. Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith explains: The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has warned of the perils that his government faces after jumping another reform-for-aid hurdle with international creditors. After a week of rigorous negotiations with foreign lenders, Tsipras\u2019s leftist-led government finalised a deal foreseeing further privatisations, reforming the energy sector and opening up the market to non-performing loans. The agreement is slated to unlock another \u20ac1bn (\u00a3720m) in loans for the debt-stricken country next week. Addressing Syriza\u2019s central committee at the weekend, Tsipras spoke of the dangers that lay ahead. \u201cThere are forces that want to see Greece\u2019s government fail,\u201d he said. The cost of insuring South Africa\u2019s sovereign debt against default has also fallen this morning, following Pravin Gordhan\u2019s reappointment as finance minister. The cost of a South African credit default swap (which would pay out if the country defaulted), has dropped from 347 basis points to 320 basis points this morning. That means it now costs $320,00 per year to insure $10m of SA bonds. European currencies are losing ground against the US dollar this morning. The pound has dropped by half a cent, to $1.516, while the euro has lost a third of a cent to $1.096. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, says traders are \u201crepositioning themselves\u201d ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Fed meeting: \u201cCurrency markets are in retracement mode to start the trading week. The Swiss Franc, Euro, British Pound and Japanese Yen are trading lower having outperformed on Friday while the Australian and Canadian Dollars are in recovery mode having been the weakest over the same period.\u201d The South African rand is the best-performing emerging market currency, thanks to the sudden switch in finance ministers: Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale is also worried about the junk bond market. He predicts pain as investors who have piled into riskier assets in the search for decent returns try to cash out, particularly from energy and commodity companies. Kit writes: The news on Friday that Third Avenue Management is winding up its \u2018Focused Credit Fund\u2019 prompted plenty of parallels with the closure of mortgage-backed credit funds ahead of the financial crisis in 2008. A decade ago, easy money was fuelling a surge in mortgage lending and it was investors in that market who took the hit as borrowers suffered from economic slowdown and higher rates. Part of the problem for US High Yield funds is that they have been forced down the credit curve in search of yield. But commodity and especially resource-backed borrowers have been responsible for an outsized share of the growth in the market. On a positive note, the commodity market is much smaller than the mortgage market, especially in developed economies. On a negative note, it is now very clear that this is where the danger of even a small, extremely well-flagged Fed rate hike triggering a major reaction lies. Some industry pros are looking nervously at the junk bond market, where the prospect of a US interest rate hike has already caused some ructions. Junk bonds (company loans that are below investment grade) suffered a serious selloff on Friday, dropping by the most since 2011. Anxiety was rife after a junk-bond fund named Third Avenue Management announced it was halting withdrawals while it tried to liquidate its holdings. Some traders have been reporting huge gaps between the prices being quoted on corporate junk bonds, and what buyers are prepared to stump up. Veteran City analyst George Magnus suggests this upheaval might make the Federal Reserve think twice before raising rates. (ZIRP = zero interest rate policy). And as this chart from Marketwatch shows, problems in the junk bond market often (but not always) precede share selloffs; More here: Why the junk bond selloff is getting very scary South Africa\u2019s currency, the rand, has surged overnight after the country got its third finance minister in a week. The rand surged by 5% after respected politician Pravin Gordhan (a former finance minister) was appointed, in a remarkable U-turn by prime minister Jacob Zuma. Last week, Zuma fired the incumbent Nhlanhla Nene (who had succeed Gordhan in May 2014), and appointed a relatively obscure MP called David van Rooyen. That decision sent the rand slumping on the international markets; seemingly triggering a change of heart for Zuma, and a call to Gordhan (who had previously run the finance ministry from 2009 to 2014). And that has prompted the biggest surge in the rand since 2008, although it only recovers some of the recent losses: Analysts reckon that Gordhan is a good choice to steer South Africa\u2019s economy, which is experiencing weak growth and rising inflation. But investors are likely to be wary. As Mohammed Nalla, head of research at Nedbank Capital put it (via the BBC). \u201cCritics would say having a finance minister serving only two days doesn\u2019t bode well for the reputation of South Africa. \u201cInternational investors are probably thinking: Why didn\u2019t the president make a much more considered decision in the first place?\u201d London\u2019s FTSE 100 index of blue chip companies has climbed over the 6,000 market, as shares claw back some of last week\u2019s losses. European markets have all opened higher, up around 0.9%, having slumped by 2% on Friday. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says: So the last full trading week of 2015 is underway and \u2013 at least for now \u2013 traders seem eager to try and put some of the recent malaise behind them. He argues that investors could see a US rate hike as positive news; it means policymakers think America\u2019s economy is strong enough to handle higher borrowing costs. What\u2019s more, the sheer volume of surplus cash that is in play may well ensure that corporate borrowing costs barely feel any fall-out as a result of the policy change, mitigating some of the real downside for corporate balance sheets. The prospect of a US rate hike has already spooked investors in emerging markets. Today\u2019s Asian selloff helped to send the MSCI Emerging Markets Index down to its lowest level since 2009. The index, which tracks shares in most developing markets, has now dropped for 9 days in a row, and shed around 20% of its value this year. China\u2019s slowing economy, and the slump in commodity prices, have also hurt emerging markets: Stephen King, senior economic adviser at HSBC, predicts that US interest rates are unlikely to rise much in 2016, even if the Fed hikes on Wednesday. He told Bloomberg TV this morning that: The Fed needs to tread very carefully because China, and other parts of the world, are not as robust as the US itself. The news that Chinese factory output grew by 6.2% in November, up from 5.6% in October, might reassure policymakers that Beijing is avoiding a \u2018hard landing\u2019. But even so, King expects that the Fed will only raise borrowing costs twice, at most, next year. The oil price is dropping this morning, amid growing speculation that Iran will fuel the world\u2019s growing supply glut. Brent crude has fallen by 0.6% in early trading to $37.69 per barrel, while US crude is down 0.5% at $35.43. This follows reports that Iran is boosting its production levels, even before oil sanctions are lifted: Reuters has the details: Iran is on track to ship 1.26 million barrels a day (bpd) of crude this month, according to an industry source with knowledge of the OPEC member\u2019s tanker loading schedule. That preliminary number, nearly a quarter higher than levels just two months ago, could stoke worries over a global supply glut that have intensified since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries abandoned its output ceiling on Dec. 4. Iran and its eager potential trading partners have been quietly getting ready for life after sanctions, following a landmark July agreement with the West over Tehran\u2019s nuclear policy. Russia\u2019s envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency said last week he expected the deal would be implemented in January, leading to sanctions relief for Tehran..... Over in Asia, stock markets have endured a bumpy ride today as the prospect of a US rate hike on Wednesday night dents confidence. Japan\u2019s Nikkei tumbled by 3% at one stage, closing down 1.8%, while 2% was wiped off Australia\u2019s S&amp;P index. The Chinese stock market jumped by 2%, though. There was some relief in Shanghai after a new factory survey showed output hit a five-month high. But that didn\u2019t stop the People\u2019s Bank of China from allowing the yuan to hit its lowest level in four years. From Sydney, my colleague Martin Farrer reports: China\u2019s decision to loosen its grip on the yuan and allow slow but steady depreciation in recent weeks has added to concerns that the world\u2019s second-biggest economy may be more fragile than expected. The move, which followed an announcement on Friday of a shift towards a trade-weighted basis instead of exclusively tracking the US dollar, will also heighten concerns that China is prepared to intensify a currency war with rival regional economies in order to keep its huge export sector competitive. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The waiting is nearly over! No, not for Christmas, kids, but for the first US interest rate rise in almost a decade (probably). This week is all about the Fed, with US central bankers meeting on Wednesday night to set monetary policy. And there\u2019s pretty much unanimity that the Fed will ignore recent market volatility and raise rates to between 0.25% and 0.5%. After last week\u2019s pummelling, markets are nervous this morning as traders brace for the end of the era of record low borrowing costs. There is particular concern about the impact of a Fed hike on developing economies, who will be vulnerable if borrowing costs spike and capital flows back into the US. Analysts at French bank BNP Paribas urge caution, saying: With the US Federal Reserve likely to start its interest-rate hiking cycle next week, we reiterate our cautious view on emerging markets for the coming months. Debt in emerging markets (EM) has risen significantly over the past ten years and EM currencies have weakened, heightening concerns about credit risk. Asian markets have already fallen today, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei losing 1.8%. European markets are heading towards a mixed open: Also coming up today..... We get a healthcheck on Europe\u2019s factory sector, and hear from the head of the European Central Bank and a top policymaker at the Bank of England: 10am: Eurozone industrial production survey for October 11am: ECB president Mario Draghi is giving a speech at a conference in Italy 12pm: Bank of England deputy governor Minouche Shafik is speaking at the Institute of Directors in London And we\u2019ll be watching oil too, after crude prices hit their lowest level in seven years last week....",

But there is a risk that the government may not get agreement to restrict \u201cin-work\u201d and family benefits for EU nationals working in the UK. It would then be harder for the pro-EU campaign to rally around the call to stay in a \u201creformed Europe\u201d.</p> <p>The often unpredictable nature of such referendums means there is a significant possibility that the vote will tip towards Brexit and lead to short-term volatility in financial markets. Market turbulence need not have any sovereign ratings impact, but how Brexit would be achieved is highly uncertain and the negotiations could be lengthy and complicated. This would raise at least three key risks from a ratings perspective. </p> </blockquote> <p>The full report is here:</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/site/fitch-home/pressrelease?id=996667\">Fitch: Brexit Vote Would Be Moderately Credit Negative for UK</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-566ee091e4b05d10e1adbf91\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-14T15:38:03.967Z\">3.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Well that didn\u2019t last long. After a reasonable opening, US shares are trading lower as the oil price continues to slide towards eleven year lows. </strong>Added to that there has been some volatility on the S&amp;P 500, supposedly due to high frequency trading.</p> <p>So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 49 points or 0.2%, the FTSE 100 has fallen 0.8% and Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.7%. As for oil, Brent crude is down around 2% at $37 a barrel, now far off its 11 year intra-day low. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Whilst not at its 4% nadir, a 2% drop for Brent crude has continued to weigh on the markets this Monday, pushing the previously positive global indices into the red as the day wore on.</p> <p>Given the state of oil, and the gradually deepening shade of red in its commodity sector as a whole, it is fairly remarkable that the FTSE is only down by around 50 points at this point in time instead of facing a hefty 3 digit decline. </p> <p>The Eurozone indices were just as bad as the FTSE this Monday afternoon despite the morning\u2019s solid industrial data. </p> <p>Whilst the relative lack of news has allowed commodities to rule this Monday, Tuesday presents a much busier schedule and, with it, a different set of problems. Inflation data is set to dominate, with the UK and US both revealing their latest figures. The US number is the more important of the two; expected at 0.0% against 0.2% last month, any dramatic movement downwards (however unlikely) could throw a spanner in the works ahead of Wednesday\u2019s FOMC meeting. As that is the other reason Tuesday could be difficult; pre-Fed jitters have already added to today\u2019s tricky trading, and with the proximity of that potential rate-hike growing ever closer investors\u2019 nerves are only likely to intensify.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-566edf85e4b0e94163103818\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-14T15:27:40.459Z\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s an interesting table from M&amp;G\u2019s retail bond team comparing the economic situation the last time the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates to the position now:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bondvigilantes/statuses/676421531791138816\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Key economic/market levels today vs start of last Fed tightening cycle.

It said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The latest slide in the price of crude oil is clearly unsettling the financial markets, but it should not materially affect the prospects for the global economy. Even if prices remain below $40 per barrel, this would not prevent inflation from rebounding next year. What\u2019s more, as the latest slide mainly reflects developments on the supply side, the fall in oil prices is not a signal of weakening economic activity...</p> <p>In contrast to the dip in August, which was driven by concerns about the impact of developments in China on the demand for oil, the latest slide is largely due to the inability of OPEC to agree any formal target for supply. The recent fall in oil prices is not, therefore, a sign of renewed fears about global growth, let alone an indication that the world is slipping back into recession.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, we do not expect oil prices to drop much further, or at least not for very long...In short, cuts in non-OPEC supply and stronger demand should support a gradual recovery over the coming years.</p> <p>If, however, we turn out to be wrong and Brent remains below $40 a barrel, the impact on global inflation would not be huge.</p> <p>The upshot is that inflation should rise sharply in advanced economies even if oil settles around its current level. As energy typically accounts for 10% of the CPI in advanced economies, a rebound in energy price inflation from -10% to zero would raise the headline rate by around one percentage point. This increase would be more gradual, and the peak a bit lower, if oil prices do not recover, but it is still coming. Central banks will not change course simply because headline inflation looks likely to rise a bit more slowly than they had anticipated, as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored and core price pressures continue to build.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-566ed30de4b01dc54b2b9f86\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-14T14:38:24.199Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s key US interest rate decision and amid oil prices sliding towards 11 year lows, the American stock market has managed to open on a positive note.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 50 points of 0.2% in early trading, giving some support to European markets, which are off their lows of the day.

So I judge it prudent to tread carefully, and refrain from voting for an increase in Bank Rate until I am convinced that wage growth will be sustained at a level consistent with inflation returning to target.</p> </blockquote> <p>That may back up RBS chief executive Ross McEwan\u2019s prediction that UK interest rates won\u2019t rise in 2016 at all (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/dec/14/markets-fed-week-jittery-mood-business-live#block-566e9699e4b052107bd8b7b3\">as covered here</a>).</p> <p>Here\u2019s Katie Allen\u2019s news story on Shafik\u2019s speech:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/14/bank-of-england-deputy-governor-minouche-shafik-vows-to-tread-carefully-on-interest-rates\">Bank of England deputy vows to 'tread carefully' on interest rates</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-12-14T13:22:05.883Z\">at 1.22pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-566eae1fe4b0e9416310376b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-14T11:59:21.029Z\">11.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Yup, missed this one:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EdVanDerWalt/statuses/676368857423065088\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">With everything else going on, few noticed silver&#39;s drop to a six-year low under $13.75/oz. <a href=\"https://t.co/lsFQxL4yo9\">pic.twitter.com/lsFQxL4yo9</a></p>&mdash; Eddie van der Walt (@EdVanDerWalt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdVanDerWalt/status/676368857423065088\">December 14, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-566eac2be4b01dc54b2b9ee3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-14T11:48:08.331Z\">11.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Brent crude is also caught up in the oil selloff, hitting a new near-seven-year low today. </strong></p> <p>It\u2019s currently down 3% to $36.78, only half a dollar above the low hit in February 2009.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-12-14T11:48:18.088Z\">at 11.48am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-566ea968e4b05d10e1adbee6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-14T11:42:06.568Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The turmoil in the junk bond market (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/dec/14/markets-fed-week-jittery-mood-business-live#block-566e84f1e4b08e2ee5e58890\">see earlier</a>) has apparently claimed another victim.</strong></p> <p>Bloomberg is reporting that Lucidus Capital Partners has liquidated its positions, and returning funds to clients.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=awg3J_ggE.Uk\">Lucidus was set up in 2009</a>, when it raised $500m to invest in high-yield bonds.

Structural reforms are key to this end. It is clear that, in some countries, the large stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) is still preventing a stronger recovery in credit. All this explains why facilitating a work-out of NPLs has to be part of the package of policy actions to restore productive investment. The ongoing work towards a Capital Market Union (CMU) is an opportunity to accelerate progress also on this front.</p> <p>If we are to truly underpin confidence, it is important that, even while dealing with more pressing priorities, we do not lose sight of the need to complete our monetary union.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Draghi also added that the ECB has all the tools it needs to bring inflation back up to target.

      "bodyText": "Royal Dutch Shell plans to cut about 2,800 jobs after its takeover of BG Group is completed early next year. Shell said the cuts, quantified for the first time since the $60bn (\u00a340bn) deal was announced in April, would affect about 3% of the combined company\u2019s permanent workforce. It did not reveal which countries or businesses would be affected. The group said: \u201cShell proposes that office consolidation will be undertaken where practical in certain locations around the world. With regards to office footprint rationalisation in the UK, Shell will, following deal completion, undertake a comprehensive review during the course of 2016.\u201d The post-takeover job losses will come on top of 7,500 announced by Shell for its own business as it seeks to cut costs after a slump in oil prices. The Anglo-Dutch company announced the cuts after China\u2019s competition authority consented to the BG takeover, after it completed the required regulatory approvals. Shell approval from Brazil, the EU and Australia. Some Shell shareholders have become increasingly doubtful about the BG deal, which was agreed on the assumption oil prices would recover to $90 a barrel by 2020. The price of oil has slumped from $115 a barrel in summer 2014 to less than $40, with some analysts predicting it could fall further. Shell said it aimed to press on with the deal by seeking approval from both sets of shareholders, but Standard Life, one of the biggest investors in the UK stock market, said the deal could not work with oil prices so low. David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments, said: \u201cThe deal doesn\u2019t make financial sense at the current oil price. You have to be pretty bullish on the oil price to make this deal work.\u201d Shell could walk away from the deal or renegotiate terms or shareholders could vote against it, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He declined to say how Standard Life, which owns about 0.24% of Shell and is not among the top 20 shareholders, would vote. Cumming said the \u00a3750m Shell would have to pay BG to abandon the deal is \u201cpretty low\u201d and that Shell would therefore come under pressure from shareholders to explain how the deal will work. Shell left expected cost and revenue gains from the BG takeover unchanged at $3.5bn. The company doubled its estimate for cost cuts to $2bn last month as it sought to reassure investors that the BG takeover remained a good deal. Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said: \u201cI am delighted we now have all the pre-conditional approvals needed to move to the next important phase. This is a strategic deal that will make Shell a more profitable and resilient company in a world where oil and gas prices could remain lower for some time. We will now seek approval from both sets of shareholders as we move towards deal completion in early 2016.\u201d Shell\u2019s shares fell 1% to \u00a314.45 on Monday morning, their lowest price since the peak of the financial crisis in October 2008. BG shares rose 0.8% to 933p.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England deputy governor, Minouche Shafik, has said she will not vote for an interest rate rise until she is convinced wage growth has recovered. In the latest sign from policymakers that borrowing costs will remain on hold well into 2016, Shafik noted signs that the rate of earnings growth in the UK had \u201clevelled off\u201d recently and that other factors were also keeping inflation low, such as the strong pound and a drop in commodity prices. Her comments echoed the minutes of last week\u2019s monetary policy meeting when the Bank left interest rates at 0.5%, citing another fall in oil prices and that pay growth had \u201cflattened off\u201d. Rates have been at a record low since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. Shafik said in a speech to the Institute of Directors: \u201cThe most likely outcome is that wage growth will soon resume its recovery, but there are alternative states of the world in which it takes longer for that to happen. So I judge it prudent to tread carefully, and refrain from voting for an increase in bank rate until I am convinced that wage growth will be sustained at a level consistent with inflation returning to target.\u201d The comments come as financial markets prepare for the Bank\u2019s US counterpart, the Federal Reserve, to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. Bank of England policymakers have repeatedly sought to play down market expectations that they will take cues from the Fed in setting UK policy. Shafik, who is the Bank\u2019s deputy governor for markets and banking, said that once UK interest rates do start to rise, she sees them doing so slightly faster than markets had been implying. When the Bank published its latest forecasts for the economy in November financial markets were implying the first increase in the base rate would come in March 2017, and that it would reach 1.25% by the end of 2018. Financial markets are now pricing in a UK rate hike around the end of next year, while economists polled by Reuters mostly expect it to happen by mid-2016. \u201cShould the downside risks from the world economy fail to materialise, and absent further shocks, once wage growth has returned to a level consistent with inflation returning to target I would expect the economy to warrant a path for bank rate that increases more quickly than implied by the market yield curve used to condition the November Inflation Report,\u201d Shafik said. . \u201cI think it is interesting to note that surveys of economic forecasters \u2013 a more direct measure of the expected future path of interest rates \u2013 show expectations for a faster pace of increases in Bank Rate. Having said that, I think all agents, and all members of the MPC, expect the future path to be gradual and limited.\u201d Shafik was among the eight members of the nine-strong committee voting for no change at last week\u2019s meeting. Just one member, Ian McCafferty, voted for a rate rise to 0.75% given concerns while inflation is negative now it could soon rise and overshoot the Bank\u2019s target. Shafik saw several possible explanations for wage growth easing off: that the number of hours worked per person per week may have started to decline; that employment growth has been skewed towards lower paid jobs; and that the low level of headline inflation may be leading to less generous pay rises. Overall she was upbeat that the UK was putting the financial crisis behind it. \u201cThere are many signs that the economy is normalising - the labour market is tightening, consumption growth is solid, investment is recovering, and even productivity growth is showing tentative signs of a return,\u201d Shafik said. \u201cAnd although the downward pressure on inflation from movements in energy prices and the exchange rate are proving persistent, they will not have a permanent effect on inflation.\u201d Her view that the Bank should tread very carefully when deciding when to start raising interest rates follows similar comments from the International Monetary Fund last week. In its latest healthcheck of the UK economy, the IMF said borrowing costs should stay on hold until there were clearer signs of inflationary pressures.",

So I judge it prudent to tread carefully, and refrain from voting for an increase in bank rate until I am convinced that wage growth will be sustained at a level consistent with inflation returning to target.\u201d<br></p> <p>The comments come as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/12/us-interest-rate-rise-heard-round-world-janet-yellen\">financial markets prepare for the Bank\u2019s US counterpart, the Federal Reserve, to raise interest rates</a> for the first time in almost a decade. Bank of England policymakers have repeatedly sought to play down market expectations that they will take cues from the Fed in setting UK policy. </p> <p>Shafik, who is the Bank\u2019s deputy governor for markets and banking, said that once UK interest rates do start to rise, she sees them doing so slightly faster than markets had been implying. </p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/05/interest-rate-bank-of-england-leave-record-low-decision\">the Bank published its latest forecasts for the economy in November</a> financial markets were implying the first increase in the base rate would come in March 2017, and that it would reach 1.25% by the end of 2018.</p> <p>Financial markets are now pricing in a UK rate hike around the end of next year, while economists polled by Reuters mostly expect it to happen by mid-2016. </p> <p>\u201cShould the downside risks from the world economy fail to materialise, and absent further shocks, once wage growth has returned to a level consistent with inflation returning to target I would expect the economy to warrant a path for bank rate that increases more quickly than implied by the market yield curve used to condition the November Inflation Report,\u201d Shafik said. .</p> <p>\u201cI think it is interesting to note that surveys of economic forecasters \u2013 a more direct measure of the expected future path of interest rates \u2013 show expectations for a faster pace of increases in Bank Rate. Having said that, I think all agents, and all members of the MPC, expect the future path to be gradual and limited.\u201d</p> <p>Shafik was among the eight members of the nine-strong committee voting for no change at last week\u2019s meeting. Just one member, Ian McCafferty, voted for a rate rise to 0.75% given concerns while inflation is negative now it could soon rise and overshoot the Bank\u2019s target.</p> <p>Shafik saw several possible explanations for wage growth easing off: that the number of hours worked per person per week may have started to decline; that employment growth has been skewed towards lower paid jobs; and that the low level of headline inflation may be leading to less generous pay rises.</p> <p>Overall she was upbeat that the UK was putting the financial crisis behind it.</p> <p>\u201cThere are many signs that the economy is normalising - the labour market is tightening, consumption growth is solid, investment is recovering, and even productivity growth is showing tentative signs of a return,\u201d Shafik said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd although the downward pressure on inflation from movements in energy prices and the exchange rate are proving persistent, they will not have a permanent effect on inflation.\u201d</p> <p>Her view that the Bank should tread very carefully when deciding when to start raising interest rates follows similar comments from the International Monetary Fund last week. In its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/11/imf-lagarde-wants-britain-stay-in-eu-osborne\">latest healthcheck of the UK economy</a>, the IMF said borrowing costs should stay on hold until there were clearer signs of inflationary pressures. </p>",

      "bodyText": "CityFibre, the Aim-listed broadband specialist, is hoping to take on BT Openreach\u2019s national fibre optic network by buying assets from telecoms group KCom in a \u00a390m deal. The company is effectively doubling its fibre optic presence by acquiring 1,100km of network assets in 24 towns and cities and a long distance network connecting 22 towns and cities. It excludes KCom\u2019s network in its home base of Hull and East Yorkshire. KCom will have access to the full network for up to 15 years, paying \u00a35m a year for a minimum of five years. The move will give CityFibre a presence in 36 cities and towns across the UK, and will allow it to offer services to private businesses, the public sector and mobile operators. It will be cheaper than expanding its own network and will speed up its growth by at least five years, the company said. CityFibre will fund the deal, partly through debt but mostly from an \u00a380m placing at 50p a share with new and existing investors. The news has seen Cityfibre drop 15% to 56p, while KCom has climbed more than 2% to 105.09p. The company estimates the purchase price is 45% lower than the cost of building an equivalent network, and chief executive Greg Mesch said the deal was transformational: We believe [the acquisition] will accelerate our growth target by five to seven years, creating a credible alternative to BT Openreach across the UK. Furthermore, we are delighted to have received the support of our existing shareholders to fund this transaction, and we welcome new shareholders to the register. Meanwhile KCom said the network was no longer core. Chief executive Bill Halbert, said\u201d Today\u2019s announcement unlocks considerable value in relation to an under-utilised asset, built more than ten years ago and which is no longer core to our strategy. Over the first half of the financial year, there were encouraging signs that our business transformation is starting to deliver results and the proceeds from this transaction offer us the opportunity to accelerate investment in those plans, without the need for any material increase in our indebtedness. Jason Holden, an analyst at CityFibre\u2019s joint broker Liberum, said: Against the backdrop of relatively low fibre penetration in the UK, CityFibre represents a unique pure play on a growth market. We have raised our target price from 114p to 138p. Meanwhile Andrew Darley at CityFibre\u2019s other broker finnCap said: CityFibre becomes a national alternative to BT, offering a competitive opportunity on the existing model for business and residential service providers, mobile network operators, local authorities and datacentre operators. The deal adds to a successful year of organic development with announcements of key new relationships (eg Vodafone), new cities (Newport, Edinburgh, Glasgow), and proof points for existing networks (eg Peterborough, Hull, York, Kirklees), demonstrating the effectiveness of the business model \u2013 which has now been materially advanced by this deal. On KCom, Darley said: KCom retains access to the under-utilised network asset, managed by BT on KCom\u2019s behalf since 2009, at a net cost of \u00a34m per annum (after transfer of \u00a31m of operational costs to CityFibre), while freeing up the balance sheet for greater flexibility to comfortably accommodate the commitments of the pension and the dividend in addition to growth opportunities: the sale reflects very positively on the book value of the network assets of \u00a341.8m, reducing net debt to a proforma level of \u00a313.0m (as at September 2015), freeing up the group\u2019s financial position and opening up the opportunities for further investment in areas of strategic importance. Target 130p reiterated, and we look forward to reviewing our forecasts.",

      "bodyText": "Customers could face shortages of fabrics by upmarket brands such as Sanderson and Morris &amp; Co after Storm Desmond flooded a factory in Lancaster owned by Walker Greenbank, the maker of posh wallpaper and cloth. The company said Desmond damaged equipment and stock at its Standfast &amp; Barracks fabric printing site on the river Lune. Digital printing is expected to restart early next year but it will take until the end of April for the majority of printing capacity, which includes traditional rotary and flatbed processes, to resume. Accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers has estimated the cost of damage done by Storm Desmond at \u00a3500m \u2013 almost double the cost of the floods that hit the UK six years ago. Stagecoach, the rail and bus operator, said last week its bus service in Cumbria and the north-west of England was under water and that Storm Desmond had also hurt its Scottish business. Other companies affected by the storm included McVitie\u2019s biscuit factory in Carlisle and James Cropper, a paper maker whose Burneside factory in Cumbria was damaged. John Sach, Walker Greenbank\u2019s chief executive, said the company had stock stored at warehouses in Milton Keynes but that some fabrics would be in short supply as those supplies were sold. \u201cI think that will happen,\u201d Sach said. \u201cWe hold huge amounts of stock at Milton Keynes but \u2026 as the weeks go by, we will have shortages.\u201d He said Walker Greenbank, whose other brands include Zoffany and Harlequin, was looking to outsource some of its printing to maintain supplies until the factory is up and running again. Sach said it was too early to know the full extent of the damage to machinery, stock and other property caused by four feet of flooding at the nine acre site two weekends ago. Because of the disruption, pre-tax profit for the year to the end of January will be about 15% less than the \u00a38.8m expected by analysts and trading will also be affected in the next financial year. Sach said Walker Greenbank\u2019s insurance covered loss of profits as well as damage to equipment, stock and other items at the factory, which employs about 200 people, and that it expected to recover all the lost profits. The site is now completely dry and electricity has been restored. \u201cThe storm came on Saturday night, the flood was on Sunday morning and within 24 hours it had completely disappeared,\u201d he said. The last time the factory flooded was in 1994 when about a foot of water seeped in but before that no one at the company can remember anything similar, he said. Shares in Walker Greenbank fell 4% to 203p.",

      "bodyText": "After last week\u2019s market plunge which knocked \u00a373bn off the value of Britain\u2019s biggest companies, shares are edging higher at the start of a key week for the global economy. All eyes will be on the Federal Reserve and whether or not it will raise US interest rates on Wednesday. Before then, investors have pushed shares higher, with positive industrial production and retail sales figures from China over the weekend providing some support, despite a fall in Asian markets and the yuan slipping to its lowest level since July 2011. Among the leading risers are companies with South African links. They were hard hit last week after the surprise departure of the country\u2019s finance minister Nhlanhla Nene. His replacement - the relatively unknown David van Rooyen - was not universally welcomed, and over the weekend President Jacob Zuma made another sudden change, giving the post back to Nene\u2019s predecessor Pravin Gordhan. Despite this chopping and changing, the rand recovered lost ground and helped lift Old Mutual by 13.1p to 168.8p, making it the biggest riser in the FTSE 100. Financial group Investec is topping the FTSE 250 mid-cap index, up 41.7p at 460.7p. Meanwhile paper and packaging group Mondi is 39p better at \u00a313.14 while troubled mining group Anglo American - which dropped its dividend payments as part of a restructuring - has added 7.45p to 300.4p. Overall the FTSE 100 is back over the 6000 level - just - adding 49.78 points to 6002.56. But oil prices continued to slide amid concerns about oversupply, as Iran ramps up production ahead of the lifting of sanctions. Brent crude is down 0.95% at $37.57 a barrel. So BP has slipped 0.7p to 337.3p but Royal Dutch Shell A shares have added 3p to 1456.5p as it cleared the last regulatory hurdle for its takeover of BG, up 11.2p to 937p, after China approved the deal. There have been some suggestions the deal may now be too expensive following the plunge in the oil price, but analysts at Liberum said: We believe the combination is a good deal for BG investors and will be seen as a good deal by Shell holders in future. We do not believe Shell will try to renegotiate the terms agreed with the BG Board but will live with them. Everything the Shell chief executive has stated recently confirms this view. The only way in which the deal could fall apart is if a third party waits until Shell has received all 5 approvals and then submits a higher bid than Shell\u2019s for BG.

      "bodyText": "Asian stocks have fallen sharply and the Chinese currency hit fresh four-year lows as concern about crude oil prices and an expected US rate rise by the Federal Reserve later this week kept investors on edge. European markets seemed likely to follow suit after the People\u2019s Bank of China on Monday continued guiding the yuan lower, setting official trading midpoint with the US dollar at its weakest since July 2011. China\u2019s decision to loosen its grip on the yuan and allow slow but steady depreciation in recent weeks has added to concerns that the world\u2019s second-biggest economy may be more fragile than expected. The move, which followed an announcement on Friday of a shift towards a trade-weighted basis instead of exclusively tracking the US dollar, will also heighten concerns that China is prepared to intensify a currency war with rival regional economies in order to keep its huge export sector competitive. More encouraging Chinese economic data released over the weekend did little to improve the mood on stock markets as the backdrop of a shakeout in commodities markets and fitful global growth continued to drag on confidence on Monday. Japan\u2019s Nikkei was down 1.86% in afternoon trade after initially falling more than 3% to a six-week low, while South Korea\u2019s Kospi retreated 1%. Australian shares dropped 1.37% as the rout in commodities continued to hit the country\u2019s large resources sector. The benchmark ASX/S&amp;P 200 index fell below 5,000 points with more selling of mining stocks. BHP Billiton, the world\u2019s largest mining company, lost another 2% to a near-10-year low of $16.83. In addition, Suncorp, the insurance company, issued a profit warning on concerns about mounting payouts for weather-related claims, building costs and the weaker Australian dollar. The mainland Chines emarkets provided a rare bright spot, with the Shanghai Composite up 0.54% at the lunch break. European futures trading pointed to more falls on Monday morning. The FTSE100 was expected to open 22 points lower at 5,930 points, while the Dax in Germany was seen opening 18 points down at 10,322. Much of the glut in oil which has been concerning investors in recent weeks can be attributed to excess supply rather than weakening demand, analysts said. But the focus was turning on Monday Asia to whether markets will be able to withstand a US rate hike, which is excepted to be announced after the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy review on Wednesday evening US time. \u201cIf the Fed hikes a rate as expected, people are watching whether recently sold assets such as US shares, oil and the dollar will rebound,\u201d said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. \u201cIf they rebound, the market will likely be stabilised, but if not, we have to prepare for another sell-off.\u201d For now, investors looked past better-than-expected Chinese indicators released over the weekend. Data on Saturday showed factory output growth in China accelerated to a five-month high in November, while retail sales rose at an annual 11.2 percent pace - the strongest this year. On Friday, the Dow sank 1.8% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.9%, as falling crude prices added to investor nervousness before an expected first U.S. interest rate hike in nearly a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that equities are going to be truly tested over the coming four days, and the Fed will be a catalyst for volatility in the lead up to Thursday,\u201d wrote Evan Lucas, market strategist at IG in Melbourne. A Fed rate hike would be a first step towards normalising monetary conditions after an extended period of loose policy, which had helped shore up risk assets. Oil prices continued their freefall after the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that global oversupply of crude could worsen next year. US crude was down 0.2% at $35.54 a barrel after touching $35.16 on Friday, the lowest since February 2009.",

    "webTitle": "Nurofen's maker misled consumers over painkillers' contents, court rules", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A court in Australia has ordered drug giant Reckitt Benckiser to stop selling some of its popular Nurofen painkiller brands after finding tablets marketed for specific complaints such as back pain or migraines contained exactly the same active ingredient. The Australian federal court ruled that the British-based multinational had made misleading claims when selling its Nurofen Back Pain, Nurofen Period Pain, Nurofen Migraine Pain and Nurofen Tension Headache products. While these were marketed as formulated to treat a specific type of pain, and cost about double the price of standard Nurofen, tablets from the so-called Nurofen Specific Pain range were all found to contain the same active ingredient, 342mg of ibuprofen lysine, equivalent to 200mg of ibuprofen. The court ordered that the products should be removed from shops within three months. A subsequent court hearing will decide on a possible fine for the company. The ruling followed legal action launched this year by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which argued that even though the tablets all contained the same generic ingredient they were priced \u201csignificantly above that of other comparable analgesic products\u201d. The ACCC\u2019s chairman, Rod Sims, said on Monday that the watchdog had been concerned people might have bought the products \u201cin the belief that they specifically treated a certain type of pain, based on the representations on the packaging, when this was not the case\u201d. Sims said price sampling by the ACCC before the start of the court case found the Nurofen Specific Pain products were being sold at almost double that of Nurofen\u2019s standard ibuprofen. He said: \u201cTruth in advertising and consumer issues in the health and medical sectors are priority areas for the ACCC, to ensure that consumers are given accurate information when making their purchasing decisions. \u201cAny representations which are difficult for a consumer to test will face greater scrutiny from the ACCC.\u201d The Nurofen brand is also used in the UK and New Zealand. While many of the same pain-specific Nurofen products are sold in Britain, and also all contain 342mg of ibuprofen lysine, the British government\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it currently had no concerns about the issue. An MHRA spokeswoman said: \u201cFor over-the-counter medicines, informative names are permitted to help patients select an appropriate product without input from a healthcare professional.\u201d The MHRA has no remit on medicine pricing, and tends to intervene only when a product\u2019s name or description makes a medically misleading claim. The Consumers\u2019 Association in the UK said it had no comment to make as it had not looked at the issue. Aomesh Bhatt, head of regulatory and medical affairs for Reckitt Benckiser in Europe, said the company did not set out to mislead consumers and was cooperating with the ACCC and the federal court. It was, he said, an \u201cAustralia-only issue\u201d with no implications for UK sales. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One, Bhatt explained the company\u2019s reasoning for branding the same ingredient under multiple names: \u201cConsumers want the navigation in a grocery environment, where there\u2019s no healthcare professional to assist in the decision-making. We know that 90% of consumers look for a specific type of product for their individual pain.\u201d The company has been ordered to publish website and newspaper articles to clarify its status, implement a consumer protection compliance programme and pay the ACCC\u2019s costs. The company\u2019s Australian website has already been changed. A section describing the four types of pill connected to the case describes them as \u201cfor general pain\u201d and says: \u201cAny of the four products shown on this page have the same ingredient and can be taken to provide effective temporary relief of pain and/or inflammation associated with either migraine, tension headache, back pain or period pain.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The results of the latest national health survey released last week revealed that we are an overweight nation that \u2013 probably not coincidentally \u2013 does little exercise and is not all that interested in eating fruit and vegetables. On the bright side, however, smoking rates have fallen by a third since 2000 and have shown solid falls since in 2011-12, especially in young men and women aged between 25 and 45. Since the introduction of plain packaged cigarettes in December 2012, there has been a lot of frankly silly commentary trying to suggest they had no impact and that smoking had actually increased. In 2014 the Australian newspaper, for example, tried to spin the line fed by the tobacco industry that raising tobacco excise and plain packaging had \u201cactually increased the number of smokers buying cheaper legal cigarettes\u201d. The journalists even found one smoker who \u201cdefinitely had not cut down\u201d her smoking since the introduction of plain packaging. Not exactly definitive. Rather bizarrely, the tobacco industry suggested plain packaging had no impact by explaining how after the new laws came into effect, the industry launched cheaper packets of cigarettes, and even offered a free cigarette or two in a packet, to counteract the ... errr ... impact of plain packaging. The logic was never all that solid, but such is the case when your ideology involves defending an industry that makes a product designed to get people addicted to something that will kill them. The ABS\u2019s quarterly figures contained within the national accounts, however, showed that tobacco and cigarette consumption, despite the best efforts of the industry, fell after the introduction of plain packaging, and while in the two quarters since the introduction it did rise, consumption never again reached the levels seen before December 2012: And once the first of four 12.5% annual increases in excise came into effect in December 2014, tobacco and cigarette consumption plummeted \u2013 as it always does when there is a big increase in excise. The ALP\u2019s policy to keep the 12.5% increases going for another four years may be poor tax policy, but it sure as heck will cut smoking. Some critics suggest the ABS didn\u2019t know how to count cigarette consumption given the changes to packet sizes and the like. The ABS responded with an archly brief note suggesting that, yes, it did know how to walk and chew gum. This was not surprising given tobacco companies have been changing packet sizes and offering different discount cigarettes packets for decades. And now we can also look at the results of the latest national health survey, which involved the survey of 14,700 private dwellings across the nation. It found that since 2011-12 the number of smokers has dropped by about 7%, from about 2.8 million to 2.6 million, or from 16.1% of the adult population to just 14.5%: Now maybe the remaining smokers have collectively increased their smoking intake by more than 7% to keep the consumption of cigarette steady, or it might be time to admit that cigarette consumption has fallen. In the past four years there has been a big drop in the proportion of young men smoking \u2013 down from 18.3% to 12.8%, the biggest drop observed by any age group regardless of gender. The rate of smoking for men in their mid-20s to mid-40s remained pretty steady, unlike for women of that age group. Now for the first time a smaller proportion of women aged 25-34 and 35-44 smoke than do women aged 18-24: The news is also good for people who have quit \u2013 now the number of ex-smokers is almost double that of current smokers: But our decline in smoking rates is not reflected in healthy habits elsewhere. Only half of us do at least the recommended amount of exercise each week, and we clearly exercise less the older we get: We also are not the biggest fans of fruit and vegetables. Only half of adults have at least two of the recommended daily serves of fruit. Age certainly does make one seem more appreciative of fruit \u2013 only 42.8% of those aged 18-24 consume the required amount compared with 60.3% of those aged 65-74. With vegetables the picture is rather more grim, perhaps because adults are recommended to have five to six servings each day. Only 9.3% of Australia adults reach that goal. The rest of us (and that would include me) are most likely to be found consuming one to two serves each day: We actually consume more servings of vegetables than fruit, just not more than we need to. With only half of us exercising enough, eating the right amount of fruit and with frankly bugger all of us eating enough vegetables, it is little wonder the survey also found only 35% of adults were within the normal weight range, and nearly two-thirds were classed as either overweight or obese: Once again age is a big factor, not surprisingly given the decrease in exercise that goes with age. The graph exhibits a nice bulge in those middle-aged years that may be somewhat familiar to a few (or, in reality, two-thirds) of us. There\u2019s nothing like perusing health data to make you question whether sitting down with your feet up and a big bag of potato chips while watching the cricket is a good idea. And as one whose sedentary job sees me do less physical activity than I should, it\u2019s also a nice reminder as the Christmas holiday feasting season arrives that it might be best not to wait till the new year to start that exercise regime.",

The journalists even found one smoker who \u201cdefinitely had not cut down\u201d her smoking since the introduction of plain packaging. </p> <p>Not exactly definitive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/09/a-gst-on-fresh-food-is-an-exceptionally-dumb-strategy-in-the-midst-of-an-obesity-crisis\">A GST on fresh food is an exceptionally dumb strategy in the midst of an obesity crisis | Catherine King</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rather bizarrely, the tobacco industry suggested plain packaging had no impact by explaining how after the new laws came into effect, the industry launched cheaper packets of cigarettes, and even offered a free cigarette or two in a packet, to counteract the ... errr ... impact of plain packaging.</p> <p>The logic was never all that solid, but such is the case when your ideology involves defending an industry that makes a product designed to get people addicted to something that will kill them. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/5206.0Main%2520Features2Sep%25202015?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=5206.0&amp;issue=Sep%25202015&amp;num=&amp;view=\">ABS\u2019s quarterly figures</a> contained within the national accounts, however, showed that tobacco and cigarette consumption, despite the best efforts of the industry, fell after the introduction of plain packaging, and while in the two quarters since the introduction it did rise, consumption never again reached the levels seen before December 2012:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Consumption of tobacco and cigarettes (volume)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tea6M/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And once the first of four 12.5% annual increases in excise came into effect in December 2014, tobacco and cigarette consumption plummeted \u2013 as it always does when there is a big increase in excise. The ALP\u2019s policy to keep the 12.5% increases going for another four years may be poor tax policy, but it sure as heck will cut smoking. </p> <p>Some critics suggest the ABS didn\u2019t know how to count cigarette consumption given the changes to packet sizes and the like. The <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/d3310114.nsf/4a256353001af3ed4b2562bb00121564/0eef1e81b5623984ca257cfb002688ca!OpenDocument\">ABS responded with an archly brief note</a> suggesting that, yes, it did know how to walk and chew gum. This was not surprising given tobacco companies have been changing packet sizes and offering different discount cigarettes packets for decades. </p> <p>And now we can also look at the results of the latest national health survey, which involved the survey of 14,700 private dwellings across the nation. It found that since 2011-12 the number of smokers has dropped by about 7%, from about 2.8 million to 2.6 million, or from 16.1% of the adult population to just 14.5%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Proportion of Australians over 18 who are current daily smokers\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BUcZy/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Now maybe the remaining smokers have collectively increased their smoking intake by more than 7% to keep the consumption of cigarette steady, or it might be time to admit that cigarette consumption has fallen. </p> <p>In the past four years there has been a big drop in the proportion of young men smoking \u2013 down from 18.3% to 12.8%, the biggest drop observed by any age group regardless of gender.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Proportion of men who are current daily smokers by age group.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/evEoY/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The rate of smoking for men in their mid-20s to mid-40s remained pretty steady, unlike for women of that age group.</p> <p>Now for the first time a smaller proportion of women aged 25-34 and 35-44 smoke than do women aged 18-24:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Proportion of women who are current daily smokers by age group.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gQqSU/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The news is also good for people who have quit \u2013 now the number of ex-smokers is almost double that of current smokers:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Smoking habits by age group.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BvzfR/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But our decline in smoking rates is not reflected in healthy habits elsewhere. </p> <p>Only half of us do at least the recommended amount of exercise each week, and we clearly exercise less the older we get:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Level of weekly exercise by age group.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mvlAa/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>We also are not the biggest fans of fruit and vegetables.</p> <p>Only half of adults have at least two of the recommended daily serves of fruit. Age certainly does make one seem more appreciative of fruit \u2013 only 42.8% of those aged 18-24 consume the required amount compared with 60.3% of those aged 65-74.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Daily intake of fruit by age group.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Lf1fU/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>With vegetables the picture is rather more grim, perhaps because adults are recommended to have five to six servings each day. Only 9.3% of Australia adults reach that goal. The rest of us (and that would include me) are most likely to be found consuming one to two serves each day:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Daily intake of vegetables by age group.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/McIva/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>We actually consume more servings of vegetables than fruit, just not more than we need to.</p> <p>With only half of us exercising enough, eating the right amount of fruit and with frankly bugger all of us eating enough vegetables, it is little wonder the survey also found only 35% of adults were within the normal weight range, and nearly two-thirds were classed as either overweight or obese:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Australian's body mass index.\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wot6C/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Once again age is a big factor, not surprisingly given the decrease in exercise that goes with age. The graph exhibits a nice bulge in those middle-aged years that may be somewhat familiar to a few (or, in reality, two-thirds) of us.</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing like perusing health data to make you question whether sitting down with your feet up and a big bag of potato chips while watching the cricket is a good idea. </p> <p>And as one whose sedentary job sees me do less physical activity than I should, it\u2019s also a nice reminder as the Christmas holiday feasting season arrives that it might be best not to wait till the new year to start that exercise regime. </p>",
