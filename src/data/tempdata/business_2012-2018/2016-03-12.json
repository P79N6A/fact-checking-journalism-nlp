      "bodyText": "Behind smart Georgian facades in prime West End addresses a little-known industry that serves the growing numbers of the global super-rich in London is booming. Boasting marble foyers and plushly carpeted meeting rooms, some of these companies might be mistaken for luxury hotels. In fact, they are private offices that manage family wealth that can compare with the assets of FTSE 250 companies such as Tate &amp; Lyle and Debenhams. Family offices have their roots in the sixth century when a king\u2019s steward held responsibility for managing royal wealth, a model later adopted by many aristocrats, according to accountancy firm EY. But the modern concept of the family office \u2013 an organisation that manages private wealth and other family affairs \u2013 was developed by the financier JP Morgan and the Rockefellers in the 19th century. The number of single-family offices in the UK has more than doubled to around 1,000 since the 2008 financial crash, and they manage more than $1,000bn (\u00a3700bn) in assets, with London now the premier global hub for the secretive organisations. The figures come as researchers from Goldsmiths, University of London and Newcastle University claim the proliferation of family offices is entrenching the rise of inherited wealth and income inequality in Britain. They conclude that the industry has promoted \u201centrenched elitism\u201d, with a growing butler class of financiers and lawyers handsomely rewarded to preserve the wealth and social position of the super-rich. The number of single-family offices worldwide is estimated to have risen by up to 40% since 2008 to 10,000-11,000, with combined investable assets of up to several trillion dollars, according to industry experts. The exact total is difficult to calculate because they are structured in different ways and they are so secretive that some families may have two offices that are not aware of one another. In the UK, those that only manage a single family\u2019s wealth are unlikely to require registration with the Financial Conduct Authority. Therefore, they are subject to far less scrutiny than private banks and hedge funds, despite the size of their assets making family offices influential players in the global economy. These offices serve individual families with investable assets of at least $100m but typically more than $250m, with the top tier managing fortunes of several billion. There are 44,900 individuals with fortunes of at least $100m and 4,500 worth more than $500m, according to Credit Suisse. The average assets under management of 157 single-family offices surveyed by Campden Wealth in 2015 was $662m. The uber-wealthy known to have family offices include Bill Gates, former Google boss Eric Schmidt, Oprah Winfrey, the Duke of Westminster, the Sainsbury and Goldsmiths families, and inventor James Dyson. There are now about 1,000 single-family offices in the UK, compared with 400 in 2008, according to Sebastian Dovey of wealth consultancy Scorpio Partnership. Keith Johnston, chief executive of the Family Office Council, which represents 100 single-family offices with combined assets of $100bn, estimated the total assets under management by all offices in the UK was $1,000bn. He added the figure could be higher as there could be as many as 1,800 offices in the country. Johnston said the rise was spurred by the 2008 financial crisis because super-wealthy families were \u201cvery cheesed off with their private banks\u201d because of the poor performance of their investments. \u201cThey decided to take more control and create a structure which they felt was \u2026 entirely doing their bidding,\u201d he added. Karen Clark, managing director of the Family Office Exchange, which represents 450 single-family offices worldwide with median assets of just more than $500m, said the rise was also spurred by the subsequent spike in the number of ultra-high net worth individuals, especially since the economic upturn from 2011-12. Over the next 30 years, they will transfer $16tn in assets, which will increase the need for family offices, according to analysts Wealth-X. Clark added that London had become the prime location for family offices, not only because of the high concentration of financial and luxury lifestyle services available to meet the needs of the global super-rich but also because it offered a safe haven for those from Russia, China and the Middle East, and a more favourable tax and regulatory environment than its chief rival, New York. The surge in family offices has also led to exponential growth in a wealthy butler class as the organisations employ three-to-12 core staff, including chief executives and chief investment officers, who are usually senior bankers and investment analysts. Major banks, accountancy and legal firms, and estate agents have also established dedicated teams for super-rich families. Single-family office CEOs typically earn $330,000, according to Campden Wealth\u2019s 2015 Global Family Office report. But Mark Somers, founder of wealth management recruitment firm Somers Partnership, said those employed by the largest family offices, with assets of several billion, could earn \u201ceasily double or triple that\u201d. They may also receive bonuses of up to $400,000, according to the Family Office Club. Other rewards include use of the family\u2019s properties or private jets. Only the largest family offices, which can have more than 100 employees, usually provide in-house lifestyle management services, according to the Goldsmiths and Newcastle study. The concierge staff organise everything to the liking of the family\u2019s members, wherever they are in the world: \u201cEverything would be taken care of, globally, so that the right kind of drinks would be available in the car that picked them up, on the plane, and so on. Upon arrival, the properties would be perfect, not just clean but recently decorated to the owner\u2019s specification with permanent staff whose job it was to take care of maintenance and gardening.\u201d The study aims to illuminate how family offices create dynasties by maintaining the wealth and lifestyles of the global super-rich. Co-author Luna Glucksberg attended a family-offices conference in a hotel in a converted castle in the Swiss Alps, which heard that only 10% of super-rich families manage to retain their wealth over three generations. The study said the most successful families shared a vision of the purpose of their wealth over future generations. The mechanisms employed by family offices to achieve this include creating family constitutions, which set out rules the family members have to follow, such as attending annual or biannual meetings, which keep the various branches and generations together. The rules \u201cmay state that all family members have to get their spouses to sign \u2018pre-nups\u2019 to protect the family capital. It may stipulate how succession is worked out, how inheritances are planned or what happens when family members are not interested in \u2026 family businesses.\u201d The researchers write that family offices do not just prepare the money for the children, but prepare the children for the money: \u201cThe wealth needs to be preserved just as well as the family line \u2026 It is about creating dynasties.\u201d Family office associations said children could be incentivised to generate their own wealth by match-funding: giving them a sum from the family\u2019s assets equivalent to their independent earning. Johnston said some family offices encouraged entrepreneurship by enabling the offspring of the super-wealthy to turn their hobbies into businesses. For example, he said the son of a Middle East magnate, who had no interest in the family business, was given funding to set up a gallery because he collected art. Mike Savage, professor of sociology at the London School of Economics and author of Social Class in the 21st Century, criticised family offices for promoting the rise in inherited wealth, which now accounts for 70% of total wealth in Britain and is expected to rise to 80% by 2050. He said: \u201cWe can see them as key drivers of the inter-generational reproduction of inequality and their proliferation is likely to entrench inequality.\u201d Disputing this, Johnston said family offices have a positive impact on the economy. He added: \u201cFrom a social point of view, since wealth is more concentrated it\u2019s important that those who deploy family capital spend that money wisely. It\u2019s key that families are well-governed and make sustainable investments because that has a wider impact on the economy in terms of jobs, tax and investment.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "First it\u2019s sea bass, and then an individually wrapped dover sole. Malcolm Walker is banging high-quality frozen seafood down on the table as if he\u2019s demonstrating some kind of fish-based martial art. But he\u2019s not planning an attack on the Observer \u2013 Walker is using the icy seafood as a key weapon in his attempt to fight back against the fast-growing discounters, Aldi and Lidl, which are putting his home-grown discount chain under pressure. Walker is trying to change the perception of Iceland from the home of the doner kebab pizza, cheap fish fingers and deals on fizzy pop into something with broader appeal. You can still buy frozen chocolate fudge cake for \u00a31.50, two \u201cdeep dish\u201d pizzas for \u00a31 or a bag of Bernard Matthews mini-kievs for \u00a32. But there are also frozen scallops, whole sea bass and swordfish steaks, as well as Slimming World ready meals, quinoa and frozen berries for juicing. \u201cWe have been fighting on price for many years. Everybody knows we are cheap. Now we are trying to convince you that our food is better than you think it is,\u201d says Walker. \u201cIn England, frozen food has the reputation of being low quality \u2013 that\u2019s nothing to do with it being frozen,\u201d he says. Findus Crispy Pancakes were ousted from Iceland\u2019s freezers in 2014; the doner kebab pizza and bubble bobble prawns, which have generated many a column inch for Iceland in the past, have now been ditched in favour of cheese souffl\u00e9s, frozen soup and woodfired pizzas, albeit alongside \u00a31 cottage pies. Bringing in more premium ranges has worked wonders for Aldi and Lidl, which have attracted middle-class shoppers with cheap lobster and champagne and managed to shrug off their image as the destination shop for skint students and those on benefits. But Iceland has so far struggled to broaden its appeal in the same way. Whether it\u2019s the cheesy Peter Andre ads, the lurid red-and-white branding or snobbery about stores piled high with cheap deals, the chain is a discounter that is not riding the discounter trend. Aldi and Lidl are also able to offer the very keenest prices on everything from wine to nappies \u2013 because they focus on own-label products, sourced via their huge international parent companies, rather than the international brands that Iceland sells. Iceland might also be continuing to suffer from its early link to the horsemeat scandal back in 2013. Traces of equine DNA were found in some Iceland burgers in initial tests by Irish authorities, which generated huge adverse publicity. The level found \u2013 0.1% \u2013 was well below the 1% threshold that UK food regulators later defined as indicative of contamination or adulteration. Other retailers, whose products were tested later, were not named for selling food with such trace levels of DNA. Whatever the reason, sales at established stores sank 2.7% in the 40 weeks to 1 January and underlying pre-tax profits slipped 1% to \u00a3107m. Last year, annual profits slumped by a quarter. So far, there is little sign that the upmarket food is pulling in the punters. New data published last week by research group Kantar showed grocery spending in the 12 weeks to the end of February up more than 15% at Aldi, and nearly 19% at Lidl, compared to the same period in 2015. Iceland spending was down 2.6%. In terms of market share, Aldi now accounts for 5.8% of the UK grocery market, making it bigger than Waitrose and close to overtaking the Co-operative. Together, Aldi and Lidl have 10% of the market, meaning the big two discounters are snapping at Morrisons\u2019 heels. Iceland has just 2.1% of the market. \u201cLife is tough,\u201d says Walker. \u201cAldi and Lidl are having a big impact but the growth in their market share is not that big at all ... but they have forced prices down because [rivals] want to be seen as comparable as much as they can. There\u2019s food commodity deflation, the oil price is down and dairy prices are on the floor. \u201cIn the past four years, 3,000 convenience stores have opened in Britain and then there\u2019re the pound shops, Home Bargains and B&amp;M. Five years ago, none of them sold food; now they all do. Everybody is eating away at market share. It is an oversupplied industry \u2013 and we have to compete with everybody on price.\u201d Despite the chain\u2019s current trading difficulties, Walker, a veteran retailer who founded Iceland in 1970, last year won increased backing from Christo Wiese, the acquisitive South African entrepreneur who is also a major shareholder in Steinhoff International, the company currently trying to buy Argos. Wiese\u2019s Brait investment vehicle upped its stake in Iceland to 57% from about 20% in October last year. It sees Iceland as a way to get a slice of food-discounter action in the UK and has been rumoured to want to link it with an acquisition of Morrisons. That may or may not be true but, for now, Wiese is backing Walker\u2019s plan to expand his new Food Warehouse chain \u2013 which has bigger stores and a broader range of products. Walker plans to double the number of Food Warehouse stores to about 24 over the next year, with outlets already planned in Manchester, Bristol and Reading. Meanwhile, more exotic or premium items that have sold well in Food Warehouse, from scallops to ostrich and kangaroo steaks, are also being introduced into Iceland\u2019s 850 stores. The group is taking \u00a3100,000 a week in sales of scallops and sea bass and sold 300,000 lobsters over Christmas. Walker says that is down to ordinary shoppers experimenting with new ideas, not an influx of BMW drivers. He insists he is not trying to move upmarket and is happy with the chain\u2019s demographics \u2013 about 30% of customers are middle class. \u201cWe still sell inexpensive foods. But if you want to buy an \u00a38 dover sole, it\u2019s there,\u201d says Walker. He believes the problem is a stigma about frozen food in the UK, although we have the upmarket Cook frozen ready-meals chain here. \u201cWe have such a strong brand but it is almost working against us now,\u201d Walker says. He\u2019s even toying with a new store front that would ditch the bright red. Walker points out that in the Czech Republic, where Iceland now has four stores with plans for one more in the near future, the retailer is seen as posh. \u201cStupid, middle-class people think chilled is better. I am trying to remove the prejudice against frozen food and get people to understand it is better for you [than chilled or fresh],\u201d he says.",

      "body": "<p>First it\u2019s sea bass, and then an individually wrapped dover sole. Malcolm Walker is banging high-quality frozen seafood down on the table as if he\u2019s demonstrating some kind of fish-based martial art. But he\u2019s not planning an attack on the <em>Observer</em> \u2013 Walker is using the icy seafood as a key weapon in his attempt to fight back against the fast-growing discounters, Aldi and Lidl, which are putting his home-grown discount chain under pressure.</p> <p>Walker is trying to change the perception of Iceland from the home of the doner kebab pizza, cheap fish fingers and deals on fizzy pop into something with broader appeal. You can still buy frozen chocolate fudge cake for \u00a31.50, two \u201cdeep dish\u201d pizzas for \u00a31 or a bag of Bernard Matthews mini-kievs for \u00a32. But there are also frozen scallops, whole sea bass and swordfish steaks, as well as Slimming World ready meals, quinoa and frozen berries for juicing.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been fighting on price for many years. Everybody knows we are cheap. Now we are trying to convince you that our food is better than you think it is,\u201d says Walker.</p> <p>\u201cIn England, frozen food has the reputation of being low quality \u2013 that\u2019s nothing to do with it being frozen,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Findus Crispy Pancakes were ousted from Iceland\u2019s freezers in 2014; the doner kebab pizza and bubble bobble prawns, which have generated many a column inch for Iceland in the past, have now been ditched in favour of cheese souffl\u00e9s, frozen soup and woodfired pizzas, albeit alongside \u00a31 cottage pies.</p> <p>Bringing in more premium ranges has worked wonders for Aldi and Lidl, which have attracted middle-class shoppers with cheap lobster and champagne and managed to shrug off their image as the destination shop for skint students and those on benefits.</p> <p>But Iceland has so far struggled to broaden its appeal in the same way. Whether it\u2019s the cheesy Peter Andre ads, the lurid red-and-white branding or snobbery about stores piled high with cheap deals, the chain is a discounter that is not riding the discounter trend.</p> <p>Aldi and Lidl are also able to offer the very keenest prices on everything from wine to nappies \u2013 because they focus on own-label products, sourced via their huge international parent companies, rather than the international brands that Iceland sells.</p> <p>Iceland might also be continuing to suffer from its early link to the horsemeat scandal back in 2013. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/10/horsemeat-scandal-timeline-investigation\" title=\"\">Traces of equine DNA were found in some Iceland burgers</a> in initial tests by Irish authorities, which generated huge adverse publicity. The level found \u2013 0.1% \u2013 was well below the 1% threshold that UK food regulators later defined as indicative of contamination or adulteration. Other retailers, whose products were tested later, were not named for selling food with such trace levels of DNA.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, sales at established stores sank 2.7% in the 40 weeks to 1 January and underlying pre-tax profits slipped 1% to \u00a3107m. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/iceland-profits-fall-in-exceptionally-challenging-year-for-supermarkets\" title=\"\">Last year, annual profits slumped by a quarter</a>.</p> <p>So far, there is little sign that the upmarket food is pulling in the punters. New data published last week by research group Kantar showed grocery spending in the 12 weeks to the end of February up more than 15% at Aldi, and nearly 19% at Lidl, compared to the same period in 2015. Iceland spending was down 2.6%.</p> <p>In terms of market share, Aldi now accounts for 5.8% of the UK grocery market, making it bigger than Waitrose and close to overtaking the Co-operative. Together, Aldi and Lidl have 10% of the market, meaning the big two discounters are snapping at Morrisons\u2019 heels. Iceland has just 2.1% of the market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa0d058d3b412a198f527a96a2347283bae3f564\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa0d058d3b412a198f527a96a2347283bae3f564/0_257_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People walking past an Iceland shop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are plans to change Iceland\u2019s branding and store fronts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cLife is tough,\u201d says Walker. \u201cAldi and Lidl are having a big impact but the growth in their market share is not that big at all ... but they have forced prices down because [rivals] want to be seen as comparable as much as they can. There\u2019s food commodity deflation, the oil price is down and dairy prices are on the floor.</p> <p>\u201cIn the past four years, 3,000 convenience stores have opened in Britain and then there\u2019re the pound shops, Home Bargains and B&amp;M. Five years ago, none of them sold food; now they all do. Everybody is eating away at market share. It is an oversupplied industry \u2013 and we have to compete with everybody on price.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the chain\u2019s current trading difficulties, Walker,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/15/iceland-boss-malcolm-walker-interview\" title=\"\"> a veteran retailer who founded Iceland in 1970</a>, last year won increased backing from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/27/christo-wiese-south-african-billionaire-prepares-for-move-to-uk\" title=\"\">Christo Wiese, the acquisitive South African entrepreneur</a> who is also a major shareholder in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/19/home-retail-group-receives-takeover-offer-111m-pounds-higher-than-sainsburys\" title=\"\">Steinhoff International, the company currently trying to buy Argos</a>.</p> <p>Wiese\u2019s Brait investment vehicle upped its stake in Iceland to 57% from about 20% in October last year. It sees Iceland as a way to get a slice of food-discounter action in the UK and has been rumoured to want to link it with an acquisition of Morrisons.</p> <p>That may or may not be true but, for now, Wiese is backing Walker\u2019s plan to expand his new Food Warehouse chain \u2013 which has bigger stores and a broader range of products. Walker plans to double the number of Food Warehouse stores to about 24 over the next year, with outlets already planned in Manchester, Bristol and Reading.</p> <p>Meanwhile, more exotic or premium items that have sold well in Food Warehouse, from scallops to ostrich and kangaroo steaks, are also being introduced into Iceland\u2019s 850 stores. The group is taking \u00a3100,000 a week in sales of scallops and sea bass and sold 300,000 lobsters over Christmas. Walker says that is down to ordinary shoppers experimenting with new ideas, not an influx of BMW drivers.</p> <p>He insists he is not trying to move upmarket and is happy with the chain\u2019s demographics \u2013 about 30% of customers are middle class. \u201cWe still sell inexpensive foods. But if you want to buy an \u00a38 dover sole, it\u2019s there,\u201d says Walker.</p> <p>He believes the problem is a stigma about frozen food in the UK, although we have the upmarket Cook frozen ready-meals chain here. \u201cWe have such a strong brand but it is almost working against us now,\u201d Walker says. He\u2019s even toying with a new store front that would ditch the bright red.</p> <p>Walker points out that in the Czech Republic, where Iceland now has four stores with plans for one more in the near future, the retailer is seen as posh. \u201cStupid, middle-class people think chilled is better. I am trying to remove the prejudice against frozen food and get people to understand it is better for you [than chilled or fresh],\u201d he says.</p>",

What the staff at Starbucks are really worried about is lackluster voter turnout in the US. To help with \u201cincreasing voter registration and participation across America\u201d, Starbucks is urging its US employees to register to vote, according to a letter from CEO Howard Schultz. The letter has been sent to the company\u2019s 150,000 US employees. According to the letter, the idea came from a Starbucks shift supervisor called Fred Verillo. Back in February, Verillo told Schultz that he thought making people aware of the importance to vote would a \u201cphenomenal\u201d way to help elevate citizenship in the US. \u201cIt does not matter if you are a Republican or a Democrat or an independent. Our intention is nonpartisan, and it is simple: by helping to increase voter registration and participation, we believe more people will have an opportunity to make their voices count,\u201d wrote Schultz. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just about who will be the next occupant of the White House. More Americans should participate in all elections, even those for city councils and school boards.\u201d According to him, Starbucks \u201cwill not stop there\u201d and will soon have more initiatives focused on civic engagement and community service. To help staff register to vote, Starbucks is partnering with TurboVote; staff will be able to register using a computer or a mobile device. Starbucks also said that if staff need registration or absentee ballots sent to them, it will cover the costs of the mailings. Schultz pointed out that this is not the first time Starbucks has been involved in politics. \u201cIn 2008 we raised awareness of Election Day with customers in our stores. In 2012, we celebrated National Voter Registration Day by providing our partners a way to register using a digital tool,\u201d he said. \u201cBut given that fewer than 60% of eligible voters cast ballots in the 2012 national elections, helping to increase voter turnout at the local and national level seems another meaningful way to use our scale for good. So, we will.\u201d In 2013, Starbucks also launched a petition urging the US government to \u201ccome together\u201d and reopen the US government after it had shut down for more than two weeks. However not all of Starbucks\u2019 forays into US politics have been voluntary. Last year, when Starbucks introduced new plain red cups for its seasonal holiday beverages, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump accused it of waging a war on Christmas and even suggested a boycott of the coffee chain. \u201cI have one of the most successful Starbucks, in Trump Tower. Maybe we should boycott Starbucks? I don\u2019t know. Seriously, I don\u2019t care. That\u2019s the end of that lease, but who cares?\u201d Trump told a crowd in Springfield, Illinois, in November. \u201cIf I become president, we\u2019re all going to be saying \u2018merry Christmas\u2019 again, that I can tell you.\u201d Fortunately for Starbucks, the \u201cred cup fiasco\u201d had little impact on its 2015 sales, and the coffee giant reported better-than-expected sales growth during its holiday quarter.",
