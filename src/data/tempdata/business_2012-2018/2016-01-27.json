      "bodyText": "And finally.... Wall Street has ended the night on the back foot, after being underwhelmed by the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones shed 222 points, or almost 1.4%, to close at 15,944.46. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers a wider range of companies, lost over 1% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq slid by over 2%. Investors have noted the Fed\u2019s dovish stance, and recognised that the central bank is anxious about the global economy and the market turmoil. But policymakers still see the US economy recovering, which could mean it still raises borrowing costs later this year.... Anyway, we\u2019ll back in the morning, London time, for more reaction. Good night, GW Facebook also posted some highly impressive mobile advertising revenue: Some late breaking news... Facebook appears to have smashed forecasts. The social network has posted earnings of 79 cents per share, compared to expectations of 68 cents. And Wall Street loves it, sending shares leaping in afterhours trading. David Zervos, Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies, is telling Bloomberg TV that the Fed\u2019s statement was quite comforting. But the markets are still being driven by fluctuations in the oil price, and fears over emerging markets, he adds. Zervos says: Markets are still bouncing around on oil, still bouncing around on China. So what could turn the markets around? Signs that the US economy is still doing well, and not entering recession. Our news story on the Fed decision is now live: Here\u2019s a flavour: The Federal Reserve is keeping a key interest rate unchanged while pledging to closely monitor developments in the global economy and financial markets. In December the central bank made the decision to raise rates for the first time since the recession. Stock markets have been turbulent across the world since the move, and all the US markets entered negative territory again after the announcement. The policymakers left their benchmark rate unchanged in a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. Until December, they had kept that rate at record lows. The Fed noted in its latest policy statement that economic growth has slowed since it raised rates from record lows: \u201cThe [Fed] is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.\u201d The changes in its statement signaled that the Fed could be prepared to slow future rate hikes if recent market turbulence and global weakness do not abate..... (click here for more). The selloff is picking up pace, with the Dow Jones industrial average now down over 1%. That\u2019s not all down to the Fed, though. Apple has shed 6% after last night\u2019s disappointing results showed that iPhone sales have slowed. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, also points out that the Fed is no longer willing to describe the risks to the outlook as \u201cbalanced\u201d (as covered here). He writes: As expected, the new statement acknowledged the apparent slowdown in activity growth in the fourth quarter. The growth of consumption and business investment is now described as \u201cmoderate\u201d whereas back in December it was described as \u201csolid\u201d. The slowdown in inventory investment also receives an explicit reference. At the same time, the Fed stressed that labourmarket conditions \u201cimproved further\u201d with \u201cstrong\u201d job gains. Ashworth reckons that economic data, and financial markets, may not improve in time to allow a rates to rise in March. But he still expects a string of hikes later in the year. Nevertheless, we still think that once the worst fears about China blow over and US economic growth rebounds, the Fed will end up raising interest rates more rapidly that expected in the second half of this year. We expect the fed funds rate to reach 1.50% to 1.75% by end-2016. The Fed is primarily worried about China, argues Worth Wray, chief economist at wealth management firm Evergreen GaveKal. One expert reckons the Fed\u2019s statement guarantees more market turbulence in the next six weeks: This month\u2019s Fed meeting was always going to be all about the statement, given the FOMC bit the bullet and raised borrowing costs for the first time since the crisis in December. The tone of the Fed\u2019s comments set the tone for the next few weeks -- and the statement is being taken as quite dovish. Chris Beauchamp, Senior Market Analyst at City trading firm IG, explains: Markets got the more dovish tone they were hoping for, with the Fed noting slowing economic growth and tipping its hat towards the idea that inflation won\u2019t rise towards 2% as fast as it thought in December. This doesn\u2019t mean a March move is out of the question, but the reference to global economic developments means that there will have to be plenty more improvement in the US economy before one is a definite possibility. With the risks to the economy no longer seen as \u2018balanced\u2019 this is a Fed committee drawing in its horns. It was never going to admit that December\u2019s move was a mistake, but today\u2019s statement acknowledges that it is not time to get carried away with rate hikes. Matthew Boesler of Bloomberg says the Fed is taking the recent stock market losses seriously, without panicking. Brett House, chief economist of US investment management firm Alignvest, reckons the Fed won\u2019t raise rates four times this year (as it had been expecting). Financial commentator Bobi Petrov reckons rates will remain on hold at the Fed\u2019s next meeting, in early March. The Fed also doesn\u2019t see inflation roaring away this year - hardly surprising, given the oil price tumble. Tonight\u2019s statement says: Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further This is a useful tool, showing some of the changes to this month\u2019s statement: Note how jobs growth is now \u201cstrong\u201d after this month\u2019s blowout non-farm payroll report showed 292,000 new hirings in December. Stocks are falling on Wall Street as traders digest tonight\u2019s statement. Not immediately clear why - but investors may be concerned that the Fed has dropped that line about economic risks being balanced. There\u2019s a significant change between this statement and December\u2019s one. The Fed has dropped the line saying that the risks to economic activity and the labour market are \u201cbalanced\u201d. That suggests the Fed thinks the situation has become unbalanced.... You can read the statement online, here. The Fed is also sticking to its view that interest rates will only rise gradually, meaning borrowing costs will remain below the long-term average for some time. But it all depends on the data..... However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The decision was unanimous -- all 10 members of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee agreed to leave borrowing costs unchanged. Again, that\u2019s not a surprise. The US central bank also reckons that the American economy is continuing to heal. The statement says: Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft and inventory investment slowed. A range of recent labor market indicators, including strong job gains, points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources The Federal Reserve says it is keeping a close eye on the global economy, and financial markets. In tonight\u2019s statement, is says: The Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook. That means the Fed is considering the impact on recent market turmoil, and the fall in the oil price, on the US economy and the path of inflation. In the least surprising news of 2016, the US central bank has left borrowing costs unchanged. The policy rate remains at 0.25% to 0.5%. OK, it\u2019s nearly time for the Federal Reserve to announce this month\u2019s monetary policy decision. Remember, it\u2019s all about the Fed\u2019s statement - Wall Street is certain that Janet Yellen isn\u2019t going to raise interest rates again..... Ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate setting meeting, and following a rise in the oil price, European shares have ended the day on a positive note. With hopes of co-operation between oil producers - notable Opec and Russia - to tackle the issue of oversupply, Brent crude has jumped 3.6% to $32.96. The rise comes despite a jump in US crude inventories. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 78.91 points or 1.33% higher at 5990.37 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.59% to 9880.82 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.54% to 4380.36 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.56% at 8741.0 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was an exception, dipping 0.4% to 18,848.03 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 34 points or 0.22% higher. Another reason for the day\u2019s strength in the oil price: Russia has said it discussed co-operation with Opec over crude prices. Reuters reports: Russia\u2019s energy ministry said possible coordination between Russia and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was discussed at a meeting with Russian oil companies on Wednesday. The ministry said the discussion was related to unfavourable oil prices. There is also talk of an emergency Opec meeting in February. Despite its share price fall, Apple is still top of the pile in value terms: Markets are moving higher on the back of the improvement in the oil price. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said: The threat of the early sell-off for oil prices this morning failed to materialise with crude bouncing above the $30 mark and this has in turn lent a raft of support to equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic. Even what could at best be described as a mixed bag in terms of US oil inventory data has failed to knock sentiment so London\u2019s FTSE-100 is rounding off the day \u2013 where we tested highs not seen for two weeks \u2013 with a bullish tone. Next up however it\u2019s the latest Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting and anything that is interpreted as being overly hawkish here could readily unseat equity markets globally that are still clearly rattled by recent events. Elsewhere, US crude stocks rose to their highest level on record - ie back to 1930 - last week while gasoline stocks increased but inventories of distillates fell. The figure for distillates, which include heating oil, follows the cold front hitting the country in the past few days. Distillate inventories fell by 4.1m barrels compared to expectations of a near 2m fall. But crude stocks climbed by 8.4m barrels last week, well above expectations of a 3.3m increase, to 494.9m, the highest level since the Energy Information Administration began compiling records. Refinery crude runs fell by 551,000 barrels a day. Gasoline stocks climbed by 3.5m barrels compared to forecsats of a 1.5m increase. But despite the rises, Brent crude is up 0.79% at $32.05 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: US crude oil inventories rose by the highest level since April 2015 last week, pushing overall oil in storage to near levels not seen in 80 years for this time of year. Crucially, we did see domestic production fall ever so slightly. This distinction highlights the reaction in global trade, which has seen oil prices rise off the back of seemingly bearish headline data. With sentiment driven by record output from Iraq and Russia, alongside the entry of Iran on the mainstream oil market, any news that US output is starting to turn lower is certainly welcome for oil bulls. Here\u2019s our take on the libor verdicts: Five of the six brokers were acquitted of conspiring to rig Libor, reports Reuters. The jury also reached a not guilty verdict on one count of conspiracy to defraud for former Icap broker Darrell Read, said Reuters, but it has yet to reach a verdict on a second count. The judge has asked the jury to reach a majority verdict. The six brokers on trial were Darrell Read, Danny Wilkinson and Colin Goodman from Icap, Noel Cryan from Tullett Prebon, and Jim Gilmour and Terry Farr from RP Martin. Five out of six brokers accused of manipulating libor bank rates have been acquitted of fraud at Southwark crown court. A jury is still discussing one count against one of them, but the others have been freed. The six were accused of conspiring with Tom Hayes and others in a trial brought by the Serious Fraud Office which has lasted 15 weeks. But a jury took just a day to acquit them. The Federal Reserve is holding its first meeting since December\u2019s now-contentious decision to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. The subsequent market turmoil, focused on a slowdown in China and the tumbling oil price, has made many wonder whether the Fed was a bit premature in pulling the rate trigger. The Fed is highly unlikely to change rates at this meeting, and there is no press conference for Fed chair Janet Yellen to be quizzed about her thoughts on the aftermath of last month\u2019s move. So the statement accompanying the rate decision is likely to be scrutinised for clues as to the Fed\u2019s latest thinking. It must surely acknowledge the market slump and fears of a global downturn which have increased since December, and may even hint that it no longer expects three or four more rate rises this year. The wording of its comments on the current state of the global economy will be key, but analysts are divided on what the Fed\u2019s tone will be. Simon Smith, chief economist at FXPro said: All eyes will be back on the Federal Reserve today as they make their first interest rate decision and monetary policy statement of the year but there are no economic projections or press conference this time round, which come at the next meeting in March. We\u2019ve seen a rise in risk appetite in this final week of January which so far has been a bit of a blood bath, although the recovery from lows in many indices has softened the blow for many investors. This has come as a result of a bounce in oil prices but also a growing expectation that central banks will have to do more to support the global economy. Today\u2019s Fed meeting as a result is likely to see a more dovish tone to it, especially since the market consensus is that we will see fewer rate hikes this year than the Fed is currently pencilling in. Even though we saw a higher than expected rise in US consumer confidence yesterday a big warning shot has come from one of the world\u2019s largest companies Apple which saw its first fall in revenue since 2003. But lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said: The rate-setting FOMC committee is broadly expected to keep the benchmark lending rate unchanged this time around. Indeed, priced-in probability of an increase is a mere 14.3%. This puts the spotlight on the text of the statement accompanying the rate decision and the forward guidance contained therein. Investors appear positioned for a dovish outcome having scaled back 2016 tightening bets amid risk aversion since the beginning of the year... For its part, the Fed will have to attempt a difficult balancing act. On one hand, it will have to acknowledge recent market turmoil as well as softening US growth dynamics in the final months of 2015. On the other, it will have to re-focus investors\u2019 attention on mandate-relevant fundamentals and establish the possibility of tightening in March. This is necessary so that such a move, if deemed appropriate, does not trigger an overly violent response. On balance, the case for policy normalization remains compelling. Realized and expected inflation is firming: the latest readings on core year-on-year CPI and hourly earnings growth registered at multi-year highs while 2-3 year breakeven rates have trended upward since August. On the jobs front, the unemployment rate is at the lowest level since 2008 and nonfarm payrolls growth is running at a reasonably brisk pace, with the 12-month trend average at 220k. This means that the Fed statement will have to reassure investors that it will adjust policy if market stress infects the real economy. In the same breath, it will have to explain that as of now, the projected rate hike path has not materially changed since the first post-QE rate hike in December. The markets\u2019 subsequent reaction will depend on the degree of wishful thinking that traders are prepared to entertain. If they emphasize the first point \u2013 a possible result considering the dovish shift in expectations in spite of the aforementioned fundamental evidence \u2013 risk appetite is likely to strengthen. This will see the stocks rising alongside sentiment-geared currencies like the Australian and New Zealand Dollars while the greenback as well as the anti-risk Euro and Yen decline. A focus on the second point will probably deliver the opposite result. As investors await the latest US oil inventory figures and the outcome of this month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, Wall Street is on the slide again. In early trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 113 points or 0.7%, partly due to Apple which is down 3.8% at $96.24 following its disappointing figures. Ahead of the start of US trading, here are some opening calls: Note Apple is quoted as falling more than 3%. Oil has come back from its worst levels of the day, on renewed hopes that Opec and other producers such as Russia would act to stem the supply glut which has hit prices. Brent crude is now down 0.8% at $31.52 a barrel having fallen to $30.83 earlier. But US inventory figures due later will undoubtedly have an impact on the price, not to mention the Federal Reserve rate setting meeting and any effect the US central bank\u2019s comments have on the dollar. Meanwhile the recovery in crude has helped support stock markets. Both the FTSE 100 and Germany\u2019s Dax are marginally in positive territory after earlier falls, while France\u2019s Cac is only narrowly down. US futures are showing a 57 point decline on the Dow Jones Industrial Average after Tuesday\u2019s 282 point surge. Apple\u2019s shares will of course be in focus after its disappointing update. Ben van Beurden is upbeat about today\u2019s vote, despite the small revolt. Shell\u2019s CEO says: \u201cI am delighted with the positive shareholder vote and the confidence that shareholders have shown in the strategic logic of the combination of Shell and BG. Our immediate focus is on the successful completion of the transaction and we now await the results of tomorrow\u2019s BG shareholder vote. Assuming BG\u2019s shareholders approve the deal (they will), Shell will become the world\u2019s biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader. It\u2019s worth reiterating that 17% of Shell shareholders opposed the BG merger at today\u2019s vote. That suggests that some big City investors have reservations about the deal, despite Shell chief Ben van Beurden\u2019s best efforts to persuade them of its merits. Standard Life was the only large investor to go public - their head of equities, David Cumming, reckoned the deal only made sense when oil was over $60 per barrel, not $30ish. But Standard Life owned less than 2% of the company, so others have clearly found the deal too risky. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, reminds me that even Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s disastrous merger with ABN Amro in October 2007 got the support of 99% of shareholders (who then suffered huge losses). So a 17% revolt may sting, a little. Thousands of workers at Shell and BG now face the axe, once the merger goes through. Shell announced last month that it will cut around 2,800 positions, or some 3% of the combined company. Newsflash from The Hague - Royal Dutch Shell shareholders have just voted in favour of its \u00a335bn merger with rival oil firm BG. That\u2019s despite pressure from some shareholders to renegotiate the tie-up, which was negotiated before the oil price slumped to just $30 per barrel. During the meeting, Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden told the meeting that the deal would be a \u201cspringboard to simplify Shell\u201d, the Evening Standard reports. Van Beurden also argued that a merger still made sense despite the cheaper oil price. The deal was approved by 83% of shareholders, with 17% opposing the plan. BG investors give their verdict tomorrow, but there\u2019s little chance that they will block the deal. RBS is helping to drag the London stock market down into the red today. As traders scoff a quick sandwich (or three courses at Gaucho), the FTSE 100 is down 22 points at 5888. RBS are the second biggest faller, down 3.8% at 251p. The only biggest faller is Anglo American, the mining company, which has shed 5.2%. Other miners are also in the red, reflecting ongoing concerns over global growth. Other European markets are also in the red, as investors wait to hear from the US Federal Reserve at 7pm GMT (when it will surely leave interest rates unchanged). Here\u2019s more reaction to RBS\u2019s latest financial woes, via Press Association: Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \u201cIt\u2019s another bitter pill, but putting legacy issues behind it is essential if Chancellor George Osborne is going to off-load the Government\u2019s stake during this parliament.\u201d But banking analyst Gary Greenwood, at Shore Capital, said that, while \u201cdisappointing\u201d, the latest financial charges are not unexpected. Over in America, traders are expecting Apple\u2019s share price to slide after it warned that revenue will fall this quarter, for the first time in 13 years. RBS isn\u2019t the only bank counting the cost of the PPI scandal today. Santander, the Spanish financial giant, has announced it is setting aside another \u00a3450m to cover compensation to customers who were missold Payment Protection Insuranace. The move will dent profits at Santander UK. It could be the bank\u2019s final bill for the scandal, but we won\u2019t know for sure until the deadline for PPI claims in 2018. A wave of \u2018challenger banks\u2019 have sprung up since the financial crisis, hoping to win business from scandal-splattered big players such as Royal Bank of Scotland. And one of them, Metro Bank, has announced plans to float on the stock market. Metro, which is losing around \u00a310m per quarter, wants to raise \u00a3500m from shareholders. Random fact: Metro encourages dogs into its branches, and even lays on water bowls and doggie toys. If only bankers had spent more time doing that before the crisis, instead of churning out toxic debt and lumbering customers with PPI contracts.... The British public had better face the truth - we\u2019ll all be shareholders in the banks for a while longer yet. So argues Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at City firm IG. He told clients: RBS\u2019s ability to surprise investors with fresh bad news has been one of the hardy perennials of the past six years, and yet still the news keeps coming. George Osborne\u2019s decision to sell a chunk of the government\u2019s stake last August, which was derided at the time, now looks like a sound financial decision, but it does mean any further sales are essentially off the table. Coincidentally, with Lloyds down 2% this morning in sympathy, it seems the government will remain a key asset manager when it comes to UK banks. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s Jill Treanor\u2019s news story about the latest problems at RBS: RBS takes \u00a32.5bn hit to profits as chief executive announces bank \u2018clean-up\u2019 Royal Bank of Scotland is set to report its eighth consecutive year of full-year losses after announcing a string of charges for legal bills, compensation and a pension payment. The bank, which is more than 70%-owned by the taxpayer, said it would take a \u00a32.5bn hit to profits in 2015 as a result of a clean-up exercise, driving its share price to a three-year low in Wednesday\u2019s early trading. RBS shares fell 5% to 246p \u2013 below the 330p at which George Osborne sold off the the government\u2019s first tranche of shares in August, and less than half the 502p average price at which taxpayers pumped \u00a345bn into the bank. Issuing an unscheduled trading update on Wednesday, Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said the move was part of a continued clean-up but conceded that that the bank would make another full-year loss for 2015. It has not reported a profit since 2007. \u201cI am determined to put the issues of the past behind us, and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean up the bank and improve our core businesses,\u201d said McEwan. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long-term value for our shareholders,\u201d he added..... Here\u2019s Jill\u2019s full story: The latest problems at RBS show that bankers need keeping on a tight leash, argues campaigners for a financial transaction tax. David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says: \u201cIt\u2019s groundhog day in the City as RBS announces yet another huge provision for dodgy dealing and fleecing its customers. \u201cTry as it might, the banking sector is incapable of shaking off its past sins. The government must take note \u2014 now is not the time for it to ease up on financial sector reform.\u201d There are signs that Britain is taking a softer line with the City. An inquiry into banking culture was curiously abandoned at the end of last year, alarming campaigners. And yesterday, Bank of England deputy governor Andrew Bailey was appointed as head of the Financial Conduct Authority - and hand-picked by George Osborne for this crucial job. Citigroup analysts have warned that RBS could suffer even more legal charges this year, points out the BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed: \u201cWe still see significant additional litigation charges in 2016, on top of the charges that have been announced today. A quick explanation. When RBS says it is setting aside \u00a31.5bn to cover \u201cvarious US residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d) litigation claims\u201d, it is referring to one of the more noxious elements of the 2007-08 financial crisis. In the build-up to the crisis, milions of mortgages were sold to US citizens with shaky credit histories, who could not really afford them. Those loans were repackaged by investment banks into new financial products (the RMBSs) and sold onto investors who weren\u2019t told how dangerous they might be. Cue the credit crunch, and the collapse of the subprime market. Mortgage-backed securities plunged in value, as the borrowers behind them failed to meet their payments and handed back the key to their homes. And the smaller banks, credit unions, insurers and suchlike who had been left holding them when the music stopped (and the Big Short paid out) launched waves of legal action against Wall Street. RBS had a finger in this unsavoury pie though its US subsidiary, Greenwich Capital Markets. In 2013, the SEC accused it of \u201cmisleading investors\u201d and cutting corners, by selling loans that didn\u2019t meet underwriting guidelines. Important point: The \u00a31.5bn in new US legal charges announced by RBS this morning does not cover any potential settlements with the US Department of Justice, or various US State Attorney General investigations. Ian Gordon of Investec warns that: The timing and the cost of resolving those cases remains highly uncertain. City analysts are punting out their opinions now. And Sandy Chen of Cenkos Securities isn\u2019t too alarmed by RBS\u2019s announcement. He argues that the bank is simply cleaning up the mess of previous eras (or possibly \u2018previous errors\u2019). The new \u00a31.5bn provision against US mortgage-backed security costs brings the total bill to \u00a33.8bn - \u201ccloser to the \u00a34-6bn totals that most analysts have had in mind\u201d, Chen says. And the \u00a3500m payment protection insurance top-up should be one of the last big ones, given the FCA\u2019s consultation on a 2018/19 time-bar on PPI claims, Chen adds. His conclusion: Bad news \u2013 really? More like putting their past in their behind, as Pumba said (in the Lion King). [I think Pumba actually says \u201cyou got to put your behind in your past.\u201d -- but we get the gist] The UK government currently owns almost 73% of RBS, and at today\u2019s share price I fear we\u2019re stuck with it for some time. The taxpayer paid around 502p per share when it bailed the stricken bank out in 2008. Today, RBS shares are trading at just 250p, so we would take a stonking loss if George Osborne sells another slice of the bank. Last summer, he sold \u00a32.1bn of stock at around 320p - crystallising a \u00a31bn loss for the taxpayer. That deal was criticised, but with hindsight the hedge funds who bought the stock are now sitting on a loss themselves. RSB shares have just hit their lowest level since September 2012, I reckon. That\u2019s not good news for George Osborne, as he tried to sell the bank back to the private sector. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have slumped by 5% at the start of trading, shedding 12.1p to 248p. That makes RBS is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. Bad news for shareholders - which in RBS\u2019s case is every member of the UK public, as we bailed the bank out in 2008. Q: When did RBS last make a profit, asks Jill Treanor. CEO Ross McEwan sucks through his teeth and takes a stab at 2007 -- the year before Lehman Brothers failed. We told you that 2015 and 2016 was about tidying up these legacy issues, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing, McEwan adds. Q: How much has RBS paid out on PPI? The total bill is around \u00a34.3bn, says McEwan. Q: Do today\u2019s provisions mean RBS will declare a loss for 2015? Yes, McEwan replies. Some of these charges will hit the bottom line (not the pension changes, though) My colleague Jill Treanor asks whether today\u2019s \u00a3500m PPI provision is finally the end of the saga. We\u2019ve done the best we can, based on what we know today, to estimate what the final provision will be, McEwan replies. We think it is hopefully the end. People have until spring 2018 to file PPI claims. McEwan says PPI has been a long and torturous journey for many banks, and a reminder of how to treat consumers (or how not to mistreat them). RBS is briefing the media now, on a conference call. Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson is telling reporters that \u201cunderneath it all we\u2019ve got a strong core bank\u201d. Will it ever end, wonder City journalists.... Is Ross McEwan is cleaning up RBS ahead of a sale, wonders the BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed. RBS has also told the City that it is putting \u00a34.2bn into its pension scheme, to cover an accounting deficit of \u00a33.3 billion. That\u2019s mainly an accelerated payment of existing committed future contributions. It follows changes in accounting practice, which have made RBS rethink whether or not it has an unconditional right to a refund of any surpluses in its employee pension funds. Royal Bank of Scotland has stunned the City with a fresh wave of provisions to cover bad behaviour and legal bills. In an unscheduled announcement, RBS announced a series of new charges. In a nutshell: The bank is setting aside $2.2 billion, or \u00a31.5bn, to cover litigation claims in the US relating to various residential mortgage-backed securities. That\u2019s a legacy of the subprime crisis. It is also setting aside an extra \u00a3500m to cover Payment Protection Insurance (\u201cPPI\u201d) claims. That\u2019s the long-running mis-selling scandal in which millions of consumers were sold insurance they didn\u2019t need (or even ask for, in some cases). RBS taking a goodwill impairment charge of \u00a3498m against its Private Banking business. More than seven years after being rescued by the taxpayer, RBS is still a work in progress..... CEO Ross McEwan insists that he is cleaning up the mess of the past: \u201cI am determined to put the issues of the past behind us and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean-up the bank and improve our core businesses. We\u2019ve always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long term value for our shareholders.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets the eurozone, and business. Two things dominate today -- the turmoil in the stock markets, and the first US Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2016. Traders can\u2019t take their eye off the oil price, which is lurching around the $30 per dollar mark this week. Brent crude is currently trading around $31.42 per barrel, helped by rumours that Russia and Saudi Arabia might carve up some kind of deal to cut production. It\u2019s all a bit flaky, though. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: The symbiotic relationship between equity markets and oil prices continued yesterday as after a rocky start to trading saw a slide in oil prices below $30 drag equity markets lower, the lack of follow through saw a semblance of stability return and a sharp recovery back above the $30 level on vague chatter that senior OPEC officials were looking to open a dialogue and put together some form of deal with Russia in an effort to put a floor under prices. European markets are likely to be calm this morning, as investors await new from America\u2019s central bank. At 7pm GMT tonight, the Federal Reserve announces its decision on monetary policy. It will surely (surely!) leave interest rates unchanged, having made the first symbolic post-crisis hike last month. The Fed\u2019s statement will be scrutinised for its view on the global economy, and any signs of \u2018hikers\u2019 remorse\u2019, given the turmoil in the markets in recent weeks. Lots of companies reporting results today, although the biggie - Facebook - comes at 9pm GMT. The City will also be digesting Apple\u2019s results last night, which showed that the iPhone boom may finally be over: We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

So the statement accompanying the rate decision is likely to be scrutinised for clues as to the Fed\u2019s latest thinking.</p> <p>It must surely acknowledge the market slump and fears of a global downturn which have increased since December, and may even hint that it no longer expects three or four more rate rises this year. The wording of its comments on the current state of the global economy will be key, but analysts are divided on what the Fed\u2019s tone will be.</p> <p>Simon Smith, chief economist at FXPro said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All eyes will be back on the Federal Reserve today as they make their first interest rate decision and monetary policy statement of the year but there are no economic projections or press conference this time round, which come at the next meeting in March. We\u2019ve seen a rise in risk appetite in this final week of January which so far has been a bit of a blood bath, although the recovery from lows in many indices has softened the blow for many investors. This has come as a result of a bounce in oil prices but also a growing expectation that central banks will have to do more to support the global economy.</p> <p>Today\u2019s Fed meeting as a result is likely to see a more dovish tone to it, especially since the market consensus is that we will see fewer rate hikes this year than the Fed is currently pencilling in.</p> <p>Even though we saw a higher than expected rise in US consumer confidence yesterday a big warning shot has come from one of the world\u2019s largest companies Apple which saw its first fall in revenue since 2003.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a59eec51d6b478c60d8d80577479b838861028df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a59eec51d6b478c60d8d80577479b838861028df/0_0_3942_2366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fed chair Janet Yellen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fed chair Janet Yellen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rate-setting FOMC committee is broadly expected to keep the benchmark lending rate unchanged this time around. Indeed, priced-in probability of an increase is a mere 14.3%. This puts the spotlight on the text of the statement accompanying the rate decision and the forward guidance contained therein.</p> <p>Investors appear positioned for a dovish outcome having scaled back 2016 tightening bets amid risk aversion since the beginning of the year...</p> <p>For its part, the Fed will have to attempt a difficult balancing act. On one hand, it will have to acknowledge recent market turmoil as well as softening US growth dynamics in the final months of 2015. On the other, it will have to re-focus investors\u2019 attention on mandate-relevant fundamentals and establish the possibility of tightening in March. This is necessary so that such a move, if deemed appropriate, does not trigger an overly violent response.</p> <p>On balance, the case for policy normalization remains compelling. Realized and expected inflation is firming: the latest readings on core year-on-year CPI and hourly earnings growth registered at multi-year highs while 2-3 year breakeven rates have trended upward since August. On the jobs front, the unemployment rate is at the lowest level since 2008 and nonfarm payrolls growth is running at a reasonably brisk pace, with the 12-month trend average at 220k.</p> <p>This means that the Fed statement will have to reassure investors that it will adjust policy if market stress infects the real economy. In the same breath, it will have to explain that as of now, the projected rate hike path has not materially changed since the first post-QE rate hike in December. </p> <p>The markets\u2019 subsequent reaction will depend on the degree of wishful thinking that traders are prepared to entertain. If they emphasize the first point \u2013 a possible result considering the dovish shift in expectations in spite of the aforementioned fundamental evidence \u2013 risk appetite is likely to strengthen. This will see the stocks rising alongside sentiment-geared currencies like the Australian and New Zealand Dollars while the greenback as well as the anti-risk Euro and Yen decline. A focus on the second point will probably deliver the opposite result.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a8d4fbe4b0de317fbefc60\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-27T14:36:36.263Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As investors await the latest US oil inventory figures and the outcome of this month\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, Wall Street is on the slide again.</p> <p>In early trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 113 points or 0.7%, partly due to Apple which is down 3.8% at $96.24 following its disappointing figures.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a8d28fe4b027b9c9e83740\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-27T14:22:49.756Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of the start of US trading, here are some opening calls:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/statuses/692351571607298048\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"in\" dir=\"ltr\">US Pre-market movers:&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CAPN&amp;src=ctag\">$CAPN</a> +34.9%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24RPTP&amp;src=ctag\">$RPTP</a> +12.1%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BIIB&amp;src=ctag\">$BIIB</a> +5.4%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SUNE&amp;src=ctag\">$SUNE</a> +4.9%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TEX&amp;src=ctag\">$TEX</a> +3.2%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BBBY&amp;src=ctag\">$BBBY</a> -2.9%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AAPL&amp;src=ctag\">$AAPL</a> -3.1%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FCAU&amp;src=ctag\">$FCAU</a> -5%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BA&amp;src=ctag\">$BA</a> -6.7%&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24X&amp;src=ctag\">$X</a> -7.7%</p>&mdash; RANsquawk (@RANsquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RANsquawk/status/692351571607298048\">January 27, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Note Apple is quoted as falling more than 3%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56a8ce3ae4b00acfaea29c4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-27T14:11:08.536Z\">2.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Oil has come back from its worst levels of the day, on renewed hopes that Opec and other producers such as Russia would act to stem the supply glut which has hit prices.</strong></p> <p>Brent crude is now down 0.8% at $31.52 a barrel having fallen to $30.83 earlier.

In December the central bank made the decision to raise rates for the first time since the recession. Stock markets have been turbulent across the world since the move, and all the US markets entered negative territory again after the announcement. The policymakers left their benchmark rate unchanged in a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. Until December, they had kept that rate at record lows. But the Fed did not signal whether or not it would raise rates at its next meeting in March. The central bank\u2019s cautious outlook added to more volatility in the stock markets. The Dow dropped 223 points, or 1.4%, to 15,944. The S&amp;P 500 slipped 1.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 2.2%. The Fed noted in its latest policy statement that economic growth has slowed since it raised rates from record lows: \u201cThe [Fed] is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.\u201d The changes in its statement signaled that the Fed could be prepared to slow future rate hikes if recent market turbulence and global weakness do not abate. The statement comes against a more perilous global backdrop. Since the Fed raised rates on 16 December, stock markets have plunged, oil prices have skidded and China\u2019s leaders have struggled to manage a slowdown in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. Federal reserve chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to deliver her semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress on 10 and 11 February. The most visible sign of the rising economic fear has been the sharp fall in the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average shed more than 7% of its value in the first three trading weeks of 2016. All the US markets turned negative after the Fed statement was released. China has unnerved investors because of an economic slowdown that Beijing seems incapable of steering properly. The country\u2019s decelerating growth has shrunk global commodity prices and the emerging market countries that have supplied them to China. Last week, the price of oil reached a 12-year low of $28.15 a barrel before rebounding slightly this week. The tumbling markets so far have not shaken consumer confidence. One measurement of confidence climbed for a second month, the Conference Board said this week. Much of the optimism stems from solid job growth: US employers added an average of 284,000 jobs a month in the final quarter of last year. And the unemployment rate remains a low 5%. Home and auto sales have also been solid. But American manufacturing has remained weak. Export sales have slowed in part because a higher-valued dollar has made goods more expensive overseas. The strong dollar has also made imports cheaper, which, along with falling energy prices, has kept inflation below the Fed\u2019s target level for more than three years. The economy\u2019s growth, as measured by the gross domestic product, has lagged, with many analysts suggesting that it slowed to a sluggish annual rate below 1% in the October-December quarter. Still, they foresee a rebound to a rate of around 2% in the current January-March quarter, helped by strength in consumer spending. Many point to the Fed\u2019s December rate hike as a key factor in the stock market\u2019s tumble. The move amounted to only a small rise in the Fed\u2019s still-extremely low target rate for overnight bank lending. But it signaled that a seven-year period of near-zero rates was ending and that while borrowing costs would not be rising fast, they would be headed steadily up. The Fed\u2019s critics had warned for years that by keeping rates so low for so long, it was fueling dangerous bubbles in assets such as stocks. Some now see the falling stock prices as the correction that they had forecast would occur after the Fed started raising rates. Others say the market\u2019s swoon is not the product of the small increase in the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate. They point instead to China\u2019s economic troubles, the slide in oil prices and weakness in key areas of the global economy. Still, some economists suggest that if the Fed could have foreseen what has ensued in the weeks since it raised rates, it might have reconsidered. The Associated Press contributed to this article",

      "bodyText": "What if EDF says no to Hinkley Point? What if the French power generator, under pressure from its unions and potential lenders, decides it can\u2019t finance the \u00a318bn project, even with the Chinese chipping in? After all, the disgruntled French workers make a reasonable point. EDF\u2019s last big foreign adventure, in Finland, is nine years behind schedule and massively over-budget, so why risk another expedition? EDF\u2019s share price, remember, is down 85% since 2004: the company is in a weak position to resist its local critics. The short answer is that the UK\u2019s nuclear strategy would be in tatters if EDF backs out. If EDF can\u2019t get financing for Hinkley, then Sizewell C, the company\u2019s intended follow-on project in Suffolk, would also bite the dust. The same goes for the next plant at Bradwell in Essex, where Chinese constructors are supposed to be taking the lead but are relying on Hinkley\u2019s and Sizewell\u2019s infrastructure and momentum. And, if the UK\u2019s nuclear strategy becomes a non-runner, then the government\u2019s entire energy policy is dead. By the mid-2030s, Hinkley and other new nuclear plants are supposed to have replaced the current clapped-out fleet and added capacity on top. Onshore wind couldn\u2019t fill the gap, and anyway the government hates turbines on land. Offshore wind is currently more expensive than nuclear. Building a new generation of gas-fired stations would, almost certainly, mean missing the legally binding targets for reducing carbon emissions. George Osborne could, of course, decide that the Treasury should finance Hinkley, but that would be a monumental U-turn. It would mean abandoning the core principle that Hinkley\u2019s costs must be kept away from the public debt. UK taxpayers would be exposed to the same potential cost overruns that are causing so much angst at EDF. The position is not yet that dire for the government. EDF is still at the table and the French government, when push comes to shove, tends to be supportive. The best guess \u2013 still \u2013 is that the funds will be forthcoming. If not, Osborne\u2019s difficulty with Google\u2019s tax bill would look like a storm in a tea cup. All the subsidies, and the grovelling for Chinese cash, would have yielded nothing except proof of the horrible economics of nuclear power in the 21st century. Worst is not yet over for RBS Put away the bunting. Royal Bank of Scotland will not be announcing a profit for 2015 next month. In truth, such an outcome was already an outside bet, but chief executive Ross McEwan removed all doubt on Wednesday by serving yet another dish of write-offs and provisions, covering payment protection insurance, the Coutts private bank and mortgage-backed securities in the US. By way of novelty, there was an unfamiliar side order in the form of \u00a34.2bn to cover the deficit in the pension fund. That doesn\u2019t hurt the profits line, but the others all do. It will be the eighth year of losses. Can shareholders \u2013 in other words, us \u2013 dare to dream that the worst is over? Not yet. When finance director Ewen Stevenson speaks of \u201ca few more bumps\u201d this year, neither he nor anyone else can know whether the biggest bump will throw RBS into a ninth year of losses. The big unknown is the settlement with the US Department of Justice on those same mortgage securities. It could be \u00a32bn, but could be \u00a36bn, and current provisions cover only non-DoJ actions. RBS can absorb the latest hits, and even the DoJ\u2019s heftiest blows, because its capital position is strong. The City, though, had started to dream of dividends or a share buyback in 2017. Those hopes are still alive but Wednesday\u2019s fresh scars are a serious setback. George Osborne, in retrospect, did well to flog 5% of RBS shares at 330p last August. But, at today\u2019s 256p, a three-year low, he only has one option: sit back and wait \u2013 again. Shell\u2019s BG suit wears thin for dissenters Ben van Beurden, Shell\u2019s chief executive, says he is \u201cdelighted with the positive shareholder vote and the confidence that shareholders have shown in the strategic logic of the combination of Shell and BG\u201d. Well, yes, 83% is an overwhelming majority, but 17% dissent is on the high side. Shell is a corporate titan and this was, in effect, a vote of confidence in the board\u2019s judgment. The company also had some of the world\u2019s most powerful investment banks acting as whippers-in. The real test is where Shell stands in two years time and whether it can maintain its dividend. Van Beurden knew the sliding oil price made his BG pitch harder to sell \u2013 but he would surely have hoped to keep the scepticism in single figures.",

However, at this point, no decisions have been made and there can be no certainty that any process will be formalised.\u201d The company will have to consider the volatility of the stock markets before pressing ahead with its plans. Comparethemarket.com has become one of the UK\u2019s best-known brands after its campaign featuring animated meerkat characters, who originally ran a website called \u201ccomparethemeerkat.com\u201d, first launched in January 2009. Other meerkat promotions for the website have included a three-year sponsorship of Coronation Street and Meerkat Movies, a two-for-one cinema tickets offer launched in April 2015. Merchandising spin-offs, including cuddly toys, a spoof autobiography of main meerkat character Aleksandr and downloads including ringtones, have proved a lucrative business in themselves. Matthew Donaldson, chief executive of BGL, said the campaign had been a key reason for the growth of the business. He said: \u201cWe knew that people didn\u2019t recognise the name, so we asked agencies to come up with something different, daring and amusing.\u201d The parent company of Peterborough-based BGL is the South African-based insurance group BHL, majority owned by family trusts of Douw Steyn, the founder of BGL and one of the richest men in the insurance business. There are other family trusts representing a second family, and the management team owns 8%. BHL is likely to sell a minority shareholding if the flotation goes ahead, with the proceeds to be reinvested in other parts of the group\u2019s empire. Steyn founded BGL Group\u2019s UK insurance underwriting business in 1992 and oversaw its move into broking in 1997. He stepped down as non-executive chairman in 2012 and is now said to be worth around \u00a3500m. He now has little regular contact with the business. Steyn\u2019s big focus recently has been the creation of what is called a \u201clifestyle estate\u201d, Steyn City, which is sandwiched between an affluent golf estate and a low-income neighbourhood on the northern outskirts of Johannesburg. Steyn\u2019s palatial mansion is believed to be the most expensive home ever built in the country, even pipping President Jacob Zuma\u2019s Nkandla. Steyn City, which used to be occupied by a squatter camp, is four times the size of Monaco. Separately, Metro Bank, the loss-making challenger to the UK\u2019s established high street banking groups, is pressing ahead with its own plans for a stock market listing next month that is expected to value the company at nearly \u00a32bn. The lender, which has opened 40 branches since launching in 2010, plans to raise \u00a3500m from its 450 shareholders and is seeking a stock market listing in the first quarter. Its shares are expected to start trading at the end of February. CMC Markets, the spread-betting firm, on Tuesday priced its own IPO at \u00a3740m, less than expected until a few months ago. However, investment banks believe robust companies with well-known brands can still attract investors if they list on the stock market. BGL is probably thinking of making a move towards the second half of the year, sources said.",

      "bodyText": "One of the most powerful opponents of Google\u2019s controversial tax structures, European tax commissioner Pierre Moscovici, is expected on Thursday to call on Britain and Ireland to drop their objections to radical tax reform across the EU. Moscovici, who has previously advocated a Europe-wide \u201cdigital tax\u201d on companies such as Google, now wants to tackle aggressive tax avoidance among multinationals by requiring them to file a single European tax return. He believes this reform \u2013 known as the common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB) \u2013 would remove the temptation for international firms to artificially divert income from one country to another. Member states, would still be free to set their own corporate tax rates. Britain, however, is among a small band of countries fiercely opposed to the European commission\u2019s plans, believing they would weaken the UK\u2019s ability to tailor its tax system to attract jobs and investment from international businesses. \u201cThe CCCTB [proposal] has been around a very long time,\u201d Treasury minister David Gauke said last year. \u201cIt is a proposal still looking for a justification.\u201d Moscovici is due to give an update on other corporate tax reforms in Brussels on Thurday morning, but is expected to use the occasion to insist his CCCTB reforms are far from dead in the water \u2013 despite British opposition. The former French finance minister has a long track record of challenging the tax affairs of internet companies \u2013 and Google in particular. Two years ago, he led calls for the G20 to create dedicated tax rules for digital companies, though his efforts were ultimately blocked by American pressure. He has also previously advocated a Europe-wide \u201cdigital tax\u201d on internet companies that make money from consumers\u2019 personal data. France has consistently taken a tougher approach to aggressive tax planning by Google and other digital companies. In 2011, tax inspectors raided the search group\u2019s Paris offices, and ever since have been challenging Google\u2019s claims that its French sales can be legitimately booked in Ireland. French tax officials are said to be seeking \u00a3380m in back taxes. Google is next week expected to reveal that its controversial tax structures have boosted its offshore cash reserves to $43bn \u2013 up $4bn in 12 months. Overnight on Tuesday, fellow US tech group Apple, which also uses controversial tax structures to pay less tax in Europe, revealed its offshore cash pile has now reached $200bn \u2013 largely held through companies in Ireland. Chief executive Tim Cook boasted Apple now had \u201cthe mother of all balance sheets\u201d. Earlier this month, Moscovici told MEPs that he wanted to make 2016 \u201cthe year of tax reform\u201d, with CCCTB at the centre of his plans. \u201cWe have a serious problem with tax avoidance and lack of transparency. Too many people have looked the other way\u201d, Moscovici said. Since unveiling his reforms last summer, the European tax commissioner has been barraged with lobbying submissions. The majority have come from business trade bodies, law firms and multinationals, many based in the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands. But Moscovici insists widespread anger among voters at a string of tax scandals will play a vital role in winning round reluctant governments, often subject to lobbying from big business. He has described CCCTB as part of a [global] trend, drawing support from the pressure of public opinion. Britain, meanwhile, has attempted to tackle Google\u2019s tax avoidance in its own way. Chancellor George Osborne last year introduced a new tax on diverted profits, having promised to put a stop to technology companies such as Google going to what he called \u201cextraordinary lengths to pay little or no tax\u201d in the UK. Of those who used such structures, he said: \u201cyou abuse the trust of the British people\u201d. But last week his crackdown pledge was left in tatters after Google confirmed it had struck a deal with HMRC that effectively allowed it to continue to route \u00a34.6bn of UK sales via an Irish company that pays no tax in Britain. Google\u2019s UK arm \u2013 which paid \u00a321m in tax according to its latest accounts \u2013 will only be required to pay slightly more to HMRC under the settlement. Critics have branded it a sweetheart deal, pointing out that the \u00a3130m in back taxes, which relates to a 10-year period, is tiny in comparison with the sums mounting up in Google\u2019s coffers in Bermuda. George Osborne has been vocal in supporting some initiatives on international tax reform, but has confused many tax experts by also slashing the UK tax rate \u2013 due to fall to 18% by 2020 \u2013 and introducing controversial tax breaks to attract multinationals to invest in Britain. Google last year stalled its plans for a big new London headquarters in King\u2019s Cross, London, insisting, according to reports, that the design proposals for a building \u2013 complete with a rooftop pool \u2013 to house 5,000 workers were \u201cboring\u201d. A new architect has since been hired, and fresh plans are now expected. In 2011, Google increased its workforce in France by half and invested heavily in a new Paris head office near the Saint-Lazare train station amid public anger about its tax payments. One French senator accused the group of running its local business as a \u201ccharity\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Shell shareholders vote for BG Group takeover despite opposition", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shell has won shareholder approval for its \u00a335bn takeover of BG Group despite nearly a fifth of investors opposing the deal. At a specially convened general meeting in The Hague on Wednesday, 83% of Shell shareholders voted for the acquisition, despite claims that the Anglo Dutch group was paying too much for its rival during a period of collapsing oil prices and should be investing instead in renewable energy. Ben van Beurden, the Shell chief executive, expressed relief he had won the day, although for the merger to be consummated, he must also secure the support of BG investors at a separate meeting in London on Thursday. \u201cI am delighted with the positive shareholder vote and the confidence that shareholders have shown in the strategic logic of the combination of Shell and BG,\u201d he said. Van Beurden and Shell are struggling because the company has already warned it is heading for a 50% reduction in fourth-quarter profits and \u00a35bn worth of asset writedowns because of low commodity prices. Management expressed confidence that the price of oil would eventually bounce back, but Simon Henry, chief financial officer, admitted Shell \u2013 even without a merger \u2013 would face challenges if crude remained at $40 to $50 per barrel over a long period. The price of oil has been at 12-year lows, although it has lifted off these levels to around $31. It has been badly affected by the oversupply from US shale producers, an unwillingness of Opec members to cut production and, most recently, Iran\u2019s re-entry into the oil supply market after the lifting of sanctions. At the same time, demand for oil is lower than expected because of a faster-than anticipated economic slowdown in China and elsewhere. Few at the meeting spoke out against the tie-up, but the 17% who did not vote in favour represents a sizeable rebellion. Standard Life had earlier said the merger was \u201cvalue destructive\u201d. On the day, some opposition came from shareholders who thought it was time for Shell to change strategic direction and work harder for the low-carbon world envisaged by negotiators at the recent climate change talks in Paris. \u201cWe have voted against this deal because we think there is a much better way to spend billions: in renewable energy,\u201d said Mark van Baal, founder of Follow This, a group of Shell investors supporting green energy. Shell shares rose slightly to 1,401p on the day, but they remain almost 40% lower than where they were 12 months ago. Despite this, there was a note from analysts at investment bank Barclays Capital recommending buying the shares. \u201cShell is clearly not exempt from the squeeze in earnings and cashflow faced by the industry, but with the acquired assets it is likely to have more levers than most to pull through the downturn. We continue to see the investment case for Royal Dutch Shell as compelling,\u201d said Barclays. But there will be nervousness in Aberdeen, the British offshore oil capital, because more jobs could be on the line. Shell has already promised to sell off $30bn (\u00a321bn) worth of assets and cut 10,000 more jobs once the BG merger is complete. The UK North Sea is particularly vulnerable because it is a high-cost area from which to produce oil. Shell last year unveiled plans to reduce the headcount of its workforce by 6,500 worldwide. The cash and shares deal agreed between the boards of the two companies involves a 50% premium to the price of BG at the time. The deal was first unveiled last April, when the price of oil was $55 per barrel. Shell believes that BG offers it access to significant new oil markets such as deep-water fields in Brazil, and more exposure to Australia\u2019s growing gas reserves. BG was once part of state-owned British Gas, but has grown to become a substantial international exploration and production company. There has been particular concern in the City that the Shell dividend, an important income generator for many pension fund investors, could in future be slashed but the company insists that it is safe.",

      "bodyText": "British insurer Legal &amp; General has teamed up with a Dutch pension fund manager to construct 3,000 apartments across the UK under a \u00a3600m \u201cbuild-to-rent\u201d plan. L&amp;G and PGGM will initially build 650 flats in Bristol, Salford and Walthamstow, north-east London, to help tackle the housing crisis. Only about half of the 250,000 new homes thought to be needed every year are being built. The UK private rental market has traditionally been dominated by individual buy-to-let landlords, but thepast in the few years, big institutional investors and developers such as Berkeley Homes have entered the market to build blocks of rental homes. Paul Stanworth, managing director of Legal &amp; General Capital (LGC), the insurer\u2019s main investment division, said: \u201cThe UK rental market, compared to the US and Europe, is dysfunctional, with ever increasing rents and increasingly poor accommodation. For this to change, and renting to become more affordable, we need to invest in the \u2018new\u2019, and build new homes to rent, and just stop inflating the prices of old housing stock.\u201d L&amp;G will act as the developer, and once the flats \u2013 ranging between one and four bedrooms \u2013 are built, it will be the landlord and use rental income to pay pensions. It is targeting yields of 3-5%. Other insurance companies and pension funds have been investing in private rental housing in the hope of stable long-term rental yields. M&amp;G, the asset management arm of insurer Prudential, and Hermes Investment Management have launched funds in the past two years. M&amp;G Real Estate\u2019s first deal in the sector was to build 152 private rental homes in Acton, west London, in partnership with developer HUB. The new stamp-duty surcharge on second homes, coupled with the removal and erosion of tax breaks for property investors, is likely to lead to falling supply \u2013 while demand for rented homes from those who cannot afford to buy continues to go up. But rather than buying up old buy-to-let properties, Stanworth believes L&amp;G is \u201cbetter off creating purpose-built blocks\u201d with shared utilities. L&amp;G intends to focus on urban areas with good transport links across the country and on the outskirts of London. Its partnership with PGGM comes nearly a year after the UK insurer made its first investment in private rental housing and set out plans to invest \u00a31bn in the sector. In February 2015, LGC bought a \u00a325m site at Walthamstow to build and rent more than 300 flats. It is putting this site into the new venture. A report by PricewaterhouseCoopers published last summer predicted that almost a quarter of all UK households would be renting privately by 2025 (taking the total to 7.2m households), and that more than half of those would be aged 20 to 39. As house prices have risen much faster than earnings, the number of households renting privately has more than doubled since 2001. L&amp;G has also been investing in rented student housing in partnership with universities, and is talking to local authorities about providing affordable housing. Stanworth said the way in which houses are built needed to change \u2013 pointing to the modular housing popular in continental Europe and the US. Factory-made modular housing is still a cottage industry in the UK, but Stanworth thinks it could become more popular. \u201cPeople see the quality of modern modular housing. It\u2019s hugely energy efficient and the costs are competing quite significantly against traditional build. If you create the same unit again and again, like a car, you get the same efficiencies.\u201d The insurer\u2019s Dutch partner, PGGM, has invested in build-to-rent housing for more than 40 years, pouring close to \u00a33bn into residential projects in the Netherlands and the US. Property market analyst Hometrack welcomed the new venture. Alex Rose, managing director of data analytics, said: \u201cL&amp;G has joined many other investors pursuing the attraction of stable returns from investing in private rented housing. Build-to-rent unlocks capital-intensive housing schemes, typically in city centres. The practice will be an increasingly important feature of the new-build market.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The number of Chinese tourists visiting the UK soared 37% in the first nine months of last year, taking the total to more than 200,000 in 2015. Chinese visitors collectively spent just 4% more than in 2014 \u2013 or \u00a3435m \u2013 according to the tourism body VisitBritain. However, that was a bounce back from a 1% fall in the same period a year before, after a 68% surge in 2013. While the number of Chinese visitors saw the fastest growth in the first nine months of last year, other tourists increased their spending by a greater amount. The number of tourists from Saudi Arabia slipped down 3%, but they spent 44% more, taking their total spend to \u00a3466m. The number of visitors from France in 2015 remained at the same level as the preceding year, but their collective spending rose 9% to \u00a31.2bn, overtaking Germans to be the second largest spenders collectively, behind Americans, who spent \u00a32.3bn over the period. Luxury retailers such as Burberry have reported \u201cmore challenging\u201d conditions in the UK towards the end of last year because of a slowdown in spending by tourists from China and the Middle East. The relatively high value of the pound against the euro has encouraged visitors to pick up luxury goods on the continent instead of in London or the Bicester Village discount shopping centre in Oxfordshire. The Chinese stock market crash in the summer of 2015 also raised concerns about the slowdown in the country\u2019s economy, but it remains a fast-growing market. VisitBritain, which is hoping to double spending from Chinese visitors to \u00a31bn by 2020, said they were already among the highest spenders \u2013 ringing up \u00a32,688 a head. Chinese visitors already account for almost a quarter of tourist spending in the UK. Higher incomes have allowed millions of Chinese to start taking holidays outside their country. The World Tourism Organisation estimates 100 million Chinese will leave their country on holiday this year. While Asian countries make up the top five destinations, France, Italy Switzerland and Germany are also in the top 10. The UK has proved less popular, as it is outside the EU\u2019s Schengen single-visa bloc. In a bid to boost visitor numbers ahead of Chinese new year on 8 February, the UK introduced a new two-year visitor visa for Chinese nationals earlier this month. The new visa will cost \u00a385, the same as the previous six-month visa, and enables holders to make multiple trips to the UK. \u201cChina is the world\u2019s largest outbound market and a huge tourism opportunity for Britain,\u201d said VisitBritain director Patricia Yates.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More needs to be done to propel women into the top jobs in Britain\u2019s biggest businesses, to boost economic growth, according to the head of the CBI \u2013 who wants all major companies to ensure that a quarter of all senior roles are held by women. Referring to previous efforts by the government to address the gender balance in Britain\u2019s boardrooms, Carolyn Fairbairn, the first woman to run the employers\u2019 body, said: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we broaden the exam question and talk more widely about women as leaders. I believe that this, not women on boards per se, is the real issue.\u201d Women were held back by the \u201cclubbiness\u201d of business life, which is still focused on the working habits of men, she said. \u201cToo much of UK business is still geared up for men, in terms of its social habits, its small talk, its clubbiness.\u201d The government is yet to name a replacement for Lord Davies, who set out a voluntary target in 2011 for women to hold 25% of boardroom seats in the FTSE 100 by 2015. Last year he said that at least a third of boardroom positions at Britain\u2019s biggest companies should be held by women by the end of the decade. But Fairbairn wants there to also be a focus on roles below the boardroom to encourage a pipeline of talent to develop, and avoid the situation where boardrooms are populated by women who hold non-executive directorships, rather than full-time management positions. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic that women are present in boardrooms in greater numbers. But let\u2019s be clear. Non-executive directors and even chairmen attend between four and 10 board meetings a year. They approve strategy, are guardians of values, challenge decisions and help manage risk,\u201d Fairbairn is expected to say in a speech on Thursday. \u201cThese are important roles, but it is the job of executives to take daily decisions, shape and define strategy, and influence culture through the everyday examples that they set. They are the sleeves-rolled-up leaders in our society,\u201d she will say. The latest report by Cranfield School of Management showed that 23 boards in the FTSE 250 \u2013 the rung below the FTSE 100 \u2013 still had all-male boards, with women holding 18% of all boardroom seats. Fairbairn said that even after the Davies report: \u201cThere are just nine more female executive directors on FTSE 350 boards than in 2010 and the number of female chief executives has barely moved. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough women running things and it is not getting better anything like fast enough. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that developing more women leaders will make a real difference to the success of the UK economy, our productivity and the UK\u2019s future place in the world.\u201d Picking up on the pledge by the government to conduct a new review of gender balance to build upon the Davies\u2019 report, Fairbairn said: \u201cI\u2019d like to suggest that they draw on the success of the Davies review and establish a new voluntary target of 25% female senior executives in major UK companies. The timeframe would be up to the new review \u2013 as would the milestones marking progress along the way.\u201d \u201cTwenty five per cent is a deliberately ambitious target, but I think that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d she said. When Davies published his final report he said that FTSE 100 companies had exceeded the target of having 25% women on their boards \u2013 more than doubling the number in 2011, when the target was set. At the time, 135 of 1,076 (12.5%) FTSE 100 directorships were held by women.",

      "body": "<p>More needs to be done to propel women into the top jobs in Britain\u2019s biggest businesses, to boost economic growth, according to the head of the CBI \u2013 who wants all major companies to ensure that a quarter of all senior roles are held by women. </p> <p>Referring to previous efforts by the government to address the gender balance in Britain\u2019s boardrooms, Carolyn Fairbairn, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/23/new-cbi-chief-carolyn-fairbairn-backs-eu-membership\">the first woman to run the employers\u2019 body</a>, said: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we broaden the exam question and talk more widely about women as leaders. I believe that this, not women on boards per se, is the real issue.\u201d</p> <p>Women were held back by the \u201cclubbiness\u201d of business life, which is still focused on the working habits of men, she said. \u201cToo much of UK business is still geared up for men, in terms of its social habits, its small talk, its clubbiness.\u201d</p> <p>The government is yet to name a replacement for Lord Davies, who set out a voluntary target in 2011 for women to hold 25% of boardroom seats in the FTSE 100 by 2015. Last year he said that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/29/a-third-of-boardroom-positions-should-be-held-by-women-uk-firms-told\"> at least a third of boardroom positions at Britain\u2019s biggest companies</a> should be held by women by the end of the decade.</p> <p>But Fairbairn wants there to also be a focus on roles below the boardroom to encourage a pipeline of talent to develop, and avoid the situation where boardrooms are populated by women who hold non-executive directorships, rather than full-time management positions.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic that women are present in boardrooms in greater numbers. But let\u2019s be clear. Non-executive directors and even chairmen attend between four and 10 board meetings a year. They approve strategy, are guardians of values, challenge decisions and help manage risk,\u201d Fairbairn is expected to say in a speech on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cThese are important roles, but it is the job of executives to take daily decisions, shape and define strategy, and influence culture through the everyday examples that they set. They are the sleeves-rolled-up leaders in our society,\u201d she will say.</p> <p>The<a href=\"http://www.som.cranfield.ac.uk/som/dinamic-content/research/ftse/FemaleFTSEReportMarch2015.pdf\"> latest report by Cranfield School of Management</a> showed that 23 boards in the FTSE 250 \u2013 the rung below the FTSE 100 \u2013 still had all-male boards, with women holding 18% of all boardroom seats.<br></p> <p>Fairbairn said that even after the Davies report: \u201cThere are just nine more female executive directors on FTSE 350 boards than in 2010 and the number of female chief executives has barely moved.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough women running things and it is not getting better anything like fast enough. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that developing more women leaders will make a real difference to the success of the UK economy, our productivity and the UK\u2019s future place in the world.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/11/barrier-bosses-twice-as-likely-to-be-anti-gender-equality-than-public-finds-study\">'Barrier bosses' twice as likely to be anti-gender equality than public, finds study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Picking up on the pledge by the government to conduct a new review of gender balance to build upon the Davies\u2019 report, Fairbairn said: \u201cI\u2019d like to suggest that they draw on the success of the Davies review and establish a new voluntary target of 25% female senior executives in major UK companies. The timeframe would be up to the new review \u2013 as would the milestones marking progress along the way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwenty five per cent is a deliberately ambitious target, but I think that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>When Davies published his final report he said that FTSE 100 companies had exceeded the target of having 25% women on their boards \u2013 more than doubling the number in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/feb/24/double-number-of-women-directors-davies-tells-firms\">2011, when the target was set</a>. At the time, 135 of 1,076 (12.5%) FTSE 100 directorships were held by women.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Taylor Wimpey, one of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders, and the Home Builders Federation have rejected accusations that the industry is hoarding land to cash in on rising property prices. Nearly half a million new homes in England and Wales have planning permission but are yet to be built, according to recent figures from the Local Government Association. Analysis by the Guardian found that Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders own enough land to create more than 600,000 new homes, raising questions about whether they are doing enough to tackle the country\u2019s housing shortage. The Lords economic affairs committee has launched an inquiry into the economics of the UK housing market. At a hearing on Tuesday afternoon, Lord Hollick, the chairman of the committee, asked whether there was an \u201ceconomic incentive among builders to hoard land\u201d. He noted that Taylor Wimpey built 12,454 houses last year, but owned 75,000 plots with planning permission. Jennie Daly, Taylor Wimpey\u2019s UK land director, said only 40,000 plots were \u201cshovel ready\u201d. She explained that the firm had a short-term pipeline of 415 sites with detailed planning permission, was already on site at 371 (89%), and gearing up to start building on a further 34 sites. On eight sites, planning conditions still had to be resolved, and two others involved \u201cviability issues where we are actively engaged with the local authority\u201d. \u201cBy the time we have detailed planning permission, we\u2019ve already paid for the land \u2013 our most expensive commodity is already on our balance sheet. We are incentivised to get building because only through building will we get a return,\u201d she said. \u201cThe housebuilding model does not sit well with land hoarding \u2026 It would not be an appropriate business response to sit on such a large and expensive commodity.\u201d Daly said housebuilders had to be careful not to flood an area with new housing, pointing to the \u201cdistorting effect\u201d that oversupply could have on the local property market. John Stewart, the director of economic affairs of the Home Builders Federation, the industry body, quoted evidence that nearly all the sites in London where building work had not started were owned by speculators \u2013 non-developers \u2013 and said the federation would commission research into this. When asked whether rising property prices provided an incentive for builders to hold on to land and get increased margins, Daly replied: \u201cIf one has a very clear crystal ball then that might be a business model ... House price inflation is with us currently, but it\u2019s not secure and it\u2019s not something we can bank on.\u201d Stewart said the cost of holding land meant that \u201cyou\u2019d have to assume astronomical rates of house price inflation for that to work\u201d. Daly and Stewart pointed to delays in the planning system, caused by local authorities\u2019 understaffed planning departments, along with a shortage of smaller housebuilders and skill shortages in the industry. Stewart said 1991 legislation had put local authorities in the driving seat, rather than the private sector, which he described as the \u201croot cause of the problems\u201d. He called on local authorities to allocate a greater variety of sites that smaller companies could build on.",

House price inflation is with us currently, but it\u2019s not secure and it\u2019s not something we can bank on.\u201d</p> <p>Stewart said the cost of holding land meant that \u201cyou\u2019d have to assume astronomical rates of house price inflation for that to work\u201d.</p> <p>Daly and Stewart pointed to delays in the planning system, caused by local authorities\u2019 understaffed planning departments, along with a shortage of smaller housebuilders and skill shortages in the industry. </p> <p>Stewart said 1991 legislation had put local authorities in the driving seat, rather than the private sector, which he described as the \u201croot cause of the problems\u201d. He called on local authorities to allocate a greater variety of sites that smaller companies could build on.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Further falls in the oil price, continuing worries about China and some poor company results have sent shares lower after Tuesday\u2019s gains. The US Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision later is also causing some uncertainty. Brent crude is down 2% at $31.15 as Russia said there were no specific plans to co-ordinate action (presumably with Opec) to support the tumbling oil price. Meanwhile Chinese markets fell again following profits at the country\u2019s industrial firms fell 4.7% in December, the seventh successive monthly decline. So the FTSE 100 is currently 19.37 points lower at 5892.09, with Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac also edging down. Mining shares are under pressure after Antofagasta, down 9p at 369p, missed its forecasts for 2015 production and predicted lower than expected output for the current year. It said 2015 copper production fell 10.6% to 630,000 tonnes, below its 635,000 target. For 2016 it expected to produce 710,000 to 740,000 tonnes, well below market expectations. So Anglo American - boosted on Tuesday by sparkling diamond sales - is 10.45p lower at 242.9p, BHP Billiton is down 22.7p at 642.8p and Rio Tinto is 31.5p off at \u00a316.57. Banks have been hit by the surprise announcement of extra provisions by Royal Bank of Scotland, down 8.7p at 252.2p. Lloyds Banking Group is 1.15p lower at 63.58p and Barclays is 3.15p down at 179.85p. Elsewhere Arm is down 21.5p at 993.5p after one of the chip designer\u2019s key customers, Apple, warned of slowing iPhone sales. But graphics chip specialist Imagination Technologies, another Apple supplier, has added 4.25p to 136.50. In a buy note, Investec said: Implied second quarter iPhone units from the Apple results overnight are in line with US expectations as downgraded in recent weeks, but suggest that there is further royalty-related downside to come for Imagination. However, the group has at last started to take action on cost; we estimate that up to around \u00a325m per annum is relatively easily attainable. We retain our target price [of 160p] and buy recommendation on the basis that there is a sea change in financial discipline on the cards at Imagination; combined with a well-below trend rating and strong intellectual property backing. Meanwhile Liberum picked up on another possible reason for Arm\u2019s fall: STMicroelectronics has announced that it is closing its set-top box business. These products are primarily based on Arm\u2019s V8 technology. The closure will result in a reduction in licensing payments to Arm (around $10m per annum). No change in royalties as other companies (Broadcom, MediaTek) will pick up the volume from STM. We think consensus licensing expectations for Arm are too high in 2016 (up 10%). Arm\u2019s licensing backlog is down more than 20% since the peak and over 50% of licensing booked in the profit and loss account is pulled from backlog. Arm\u2019s licensing follows backlog with a lag and the decline in backlog is likely to impact the profit and loss in 2016. Sage, up 32p at 599.5p, and Aberdeen Asset Management, 2.7p higher at 235.5p, both pleased with their results. On Aberdeen, Liberum said: The first quarter 2016 statement reported net outflows of \u00a39.1bn. This was better than the \u00a311bn we had feared. It also indicates a slowdown in net outflows. The third quarter 2015 number was \u00a39.9bn and the fourth quarter was \u00a312.7bn. We take that as a positive but do note the cautious statements from the chief executive on the analyst conference call. He stated that, \u201cSentiment was fragile and is even more fragile now\u201d post the performance of China and other markets in January 2016. The second quarter of 2016 looks like it will also be a testing period for flows and investors might want to wait for more visibility before committing. That said, we are happy to re-iterate our buy recommendation at this stage. Among the mid-caps Just Eat is down 26.5p at 394p as Morgan Stanley cut its recommendation from equal weight to underweight and reduced its target price from 450p to 390p. The bank said: New evidence suggests Just Eat is losing share of UK delivery restaurants as alternative platforms expand. This erosion of its network effect reduces barriers to entry and puts long-term growth and margin forecasts at risk. For example, our web data gathering shows that Deliveroo restaurants represent around 12% of Just Eat\u2019s total and over 50% in certain cities. Deliveroo was launched in 2013 and it only started expanding outside of London in 2015. We envisage a scenario in which Just Eat does not have most restaurants on its platform, losing the network effect which is its main barrier to entry.",

    "webTitle": "Investors' worries over Brexit lead to increased sterling volatility", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Investors\u2019 jitters over the Brexit referendum have reached levels not seen since the 2015 general election as financial institutions seek protection from a fall in sterling, according to market data. Measures of volatility in the value of sterling indicate mounting fears that Britons may vote to leave the EU and further weaken the British pound. Since the end of 2015, more people have been looking at ways to sell sterling-denominated assets over the next six to 12 months \u2013 by taking out contracts that allow them to dump the pound if it drops below a certain level \u2013 than those looking to buy the currency. This has been highlighted in data for one year 25 delta GBP-USD risk reversals, which compares the number of people who wish to buy or sell sterling at a certain date. In early January this traded at -2.5%, with the negative reading showing that more people are looking to sell sterling than want to buy. This is close to the pre-general election nadir of -2.7% and has already surpassed the pre-Scottish referendum level of -2.1%. The negative values indicate that \u201cputs\u201d, which give option holders the right to sell to a counterparty a specific amount of a currency within a specified timeframe, are more expensive than \u201ccalls\u201d, which mean option holders have the right to buy currency from a counterparty. It means that protection against a slide in the value of sterling is more costly than taking protection against an increase in the pound. Recent polls point to a tight contest in the referendum, with several online surveys placing the vote to leave camp marginally ahead. To add to the unpredictability, the vote to stay remains substantially ahead in phone polling. The main factor of uncertainty worrying investors still remains the lack of clarity over when the referendum will be held. One year-rate of implied volatility in GBP-USD \u2013 a measure of risk related to sterling \u2013 has been capped at around 10.6 recently. This is the same level as its pre-general election high, when most expected a hung parliament and months of constitutional confusion. A greater implied volatility indicates the higher potential instability of an exchange rate over time. The same measure traded to 8.0 ahead of the Scottish referendum in 2014. Also, an increase in demand for contracts that protect financial institutions against a volatile pound between June and December suggests that the market is positioning itself for the referendum to take place between June and November 2016. It suggests that the market expects sterling to be volatile around these dates. The data is likely to be influenced by worries surrounding the global economy, a weakening pound and delays in any Bank of England decision to hike interest rates. However, the implied volatility and risk reversals into the first six months of the year hint that the timing and potential outcome of the EU referendum is a key driver. Eimear Daly, an FX strategist at Standard Chartered bank, said that \u201can acceleration of developments surrounding the EU referendum and increased news coverage has brought the UK\u2019s EU referendum into the market\u2019s focus. GBP is no longer trading largely on expectations for when the Bank of England will raise interest rates. The complete uncertainty over the EU referendum is one reason behind the GBP\u2019s recent slide. GBP will likely only be able to recover its losses on a \u2018stay\u2019 referendum outcome.\u201d There is growing optimism that Cameron will secure a deal in February, paving the way for a referendum in June. Last week, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, said he was quite sure that \u201ca permanent solution\u201d would be reached next month.",

      "body": "<p>Investors\u2019 jitters over the Brexit referendum have reached levels not seen since the 2015 general election as financial institutions seek protection from a fall in sterling, according to market data.</p> <p>Measures of volatility in the value of sterling indicate mounting fears that Britons may vote to leave the EU and further weaken the British pound. </p> <p></p> <p> </p> <p>Since the end of 2015, more people have been looking at ways to sell sterling-denominated assets over the next six to 12 months \u2013 by taking out contracts that allow them to dump the pound if it drops below a certain level \u2013 than those looking to buy the currency. This has been highlighted in data for <a href=\"https://www.tradingfloor.com/tools/25-delta-risk-reversals\">one year 25 delta GBP-USD risk reversals</a>, which compares the number of people who wish to buy or sell sterling at a certain date. In early January this traded at -2.5%, with the negative reading showing that more people are looking to sell sterling than want to buy. This is close to the pre-general election nadir of -2.7% and has already surpassed the pre-Scottish referendum level of -2.1%.</p> <p>The negative values indicate that \u201c<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp\">puts</a>\u201d, which give option holders the right to sell to a counterparty a specific amount of a currency within a specified timeframe, are more expensive than \u201c<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp\">calls</a>\u201d, which mean option holders have the right to buy currency from a counterparty. It means that protection against a slide in the value of sterling is more costly than taking protection against an increase in the pound.</p> <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum#Standard_polling_on_EU_membership\">Recent polls</a> point to a tight contest in the referendum, with several online surveys placing the vote to leave camp marginally ahead. To add to the unpredictability, the vote to stay remains substantially ahead in phone polling.</p> <p>The main factor of uncertainty worrying investors still remains the lack of clarity over when the referendum will be held. One year-rate of implied volatility in GBP-USD \u2013 a measure of risk related to sterling \u2013 has been capped at around 10.6 recently. This is the same level as its pre-general election high, when most expected a hung parliament and months of constitutional confusion.</p> <p>A greater implied volatility indicates the higher potential instability of an exchange rate over time. The same measure traded to 8.0 ahead of the Scottish referendum in 2014.<br></p> <p>Also, an increase in demand for contracts that protect financial institutions against a volatile pound between June and December suggests that the market is positioning itself for the referendum to take place between June and November 2016. It suggests that the market expects sterling to be volatile around these dates.</p> <p>The data is likely to be influenced by worries surrounding the global economy, a weakening pound and delays in any Bank of England decision to hike interest rates. However, the implied volatility and risk reversals into the first six months of the year hint that the timing and potential outcome of the EU referendum is a key driver.</p> <p>Eimear Daly, an FX strategist at Standard Chartered bank, said that \u201can acceleration of developments surrounding the EU referendum and increased news coverage has brought the UK\u2019s EU referendum into the market\u2019s focus. GBP is no longer trading largely on expectations for when the Bank of England will raise interest rates. The complete uncertainty over the EU referendum is one reason behind the GBP\u2019s recent slide. GBP will likely only be able to recover its losses on a \u2018stay\u2019 referendum outcome.\u201d</p> <p>There is growing optimism that Cameron will secure a deal in February, paving the way for a referendum in June. Last week, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, said he was <a href=\"http://%20http//www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/15/juncker-quite-sure-february-deal-britain-eu-membership-referendum\">quite sure that \u201ca permanent solution\u201d would be reached next month</a>.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is set to report its eighth consecutive year of full-year losses after announcing a string of charges for legal bills, compensation and a pension payment. The bank, which is more than 70% owned by the taxpayer, said it would take a \u00a32.5bn hit to profits in 2015 as a result of a clean-up exercise, driving its share price to a three-year low in Wednesday\u2019s early trading. RBS shares fell 5% to 246p \u2013 below the 330p at which George Osborne sold off the government\u2019s first tranche of shares in August, and less than half the 502p average price at which taxpayers pumped \u00a345bn into the bank. By lunchtime, the share price had recovered marginally, but RBS remained one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, down more than 3% at about 250p. Issuing an unscheduled trading update on Wednesday, Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said the move was part of a continued clean-up but conceded that the bank would make another full-year loss for 2015. It has not reported a profit since 2007. \u201cI am determined to put the issues of the past behind us, and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean up the bank and improve our core businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long-term value for our shareholders.\u201d The RBS finance director, Ewen Stevenson, warned analysts that there would be a \u201cfew more bumps\u201d this year and described the latest setback as \u201chumbling\u201d. The bank said not all of the measures it was announcing would hurt its profits and the hit to shareholders\u2019 equity was \u00a33.6bn in 2015. For instance, the \u00a34.2bn being pumped into its pension fund will hurt its key capital base rather than profits. RBS\u2019s pension fund has 230,000 members, about 30,000 of whom still work for the bank, although it has been closed to new members since 2006. The bank had been plugging the deficit by annual payments, but is now making a single payment. There are also new provisions of \u00a31.5bn for legal costsin anticipation of US litigation over 20 cases relating to residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) \u2013 which date back to the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 taking the total set aside for this matter to \u00a33.8bn. But the cost of this mortgage bond misselling looks certain to rise once the US authorities, the department of justice and attorney generals impose fines on the bank. Stevenson said the final bill would be \u201csubstantially in excess\u201d of the sums already set aside. An extra \u00a3500m is being set aside for payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling, taking this total to \u00a34.3bn, though McEwan said he believed that this would be the bank\u2019s last provision for this \u201clong, tortuous\u201d saga. The bank is also taking a hit from its private bank, Coutts, writing down its value by \u00a3498m. \u201cThis business can do better. It\u2019s in the middle of a multi-year turnaround,\u201d said McEwan, who has sold off Coutts\u2019s international operations. Stevenson said Wednesday\u2019s announcement should not have an impact on the bank\u2019s ability to start returning to capital to shareholders. Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: \u201cWhile such headlines are disappointing, they are not necessarily unexpected and we note that RBS now has the balance sheet strength to comfortably absorb such costs. Indeed, we estimate that the group had approximately \u00a38bn of surplus capital on its balance sheet at the end of September 2015.\u201d Sandy Chen at Cenkos said: \u201cBad news \u2013 really? More like putting their past in their behind, as Pumbaa said [in the Lion King].\u201d",
