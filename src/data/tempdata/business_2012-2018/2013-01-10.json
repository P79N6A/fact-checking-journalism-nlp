      "bodyText": "Mario Draghi sent the euro surging on Thursday by declaring \"positive contagion\" was helping to drag the eurozone out of its crisis. The president of the European Central Bank said he was confident that a gradual recovery would begin in the euro region this year. After the ECB voted to leave interest rates unchanged, he told reporters Europe had turned a corner in the crisis, with borrowing costs across the eurozone now \"significantly lower\". \"Stock markets have increased. Volatility is at a historical minimum,\" said Draghi at the ECB's monthly press conference in Frankfurt. \"We have seen strong capital inflows in the euro area.\" European commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso was also in ebullient mood. On a visit to Dublin, he announced that \"the doomsday scenario of a break of the euro has not come to pass\". Fresh economic data from Greece, though, showed the European periphery was still suffering. The Greek jobless rate rose to a record high of 26.8% in October, with 36,219 people losing their jobs during the month. Youth unemployment hit 56.6%, having almost doubled over the last three years. With Spain selling bonds at much lower interest rates than last year, Draghi's comments helped to bolster confidence in the City. The euro jumped almost two cents against the dollar to $1.326 after Draghi insisted that the ECB's governing council was unanimous in leaving borrowing costs unchanged \u2013 matching the Bank of England's own decision earlier in the day. In a sign of how the situation in the eurozone has calmed, Draghi even fielded a question on whether there was too much exuberance in European markets, where the FTSE 100 closed at a four-and-a-half-year high. Draghi denied that excessive exuberance was a big threat, arguing that Europe had simply returned to normality. \"We spoke a lot about contagion when things go poorly but I believe there is a positive contagion when things go well. And I think that's also what is in play now. There is a positive contagion,\" insisted the man credited with saving the eurozone last summer by promising an unlimited bond buying programme that has yet to be activated. Draghi cautioned that Europe still faced \"downside\" risks, but refused to be blamed for the eurozone's record unemployment levels - which he partly attributed to 'structural' problems beyond his remit. Kit Juckes, global macro strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, believes the ECB president is now 'passing the baton' to Europe's elected leaders. \"Super Mario sounded like a man who thinks the job is done, battle won, time to rest. Superhero departs, leaving unemployed to politicians,\" Juckes said. The economic data from Greece showed that women are the worst hit by Greece's long recession, with over 30% out of work. Elsewhere in the eurocrisis, Cyprus hit back at German MPs who are refusing to support its bailout because of money-laundering concerns. Government spokesman Stefanos Stefanou said Cypriot banks were the victims of Europe's decision to demand a haircut on Greek debt, which left them nursing losses of over \u20ac10bn. \"What we are asking for is an expression of solidarity, which is a basic EU principle, towards a country which is the victim of a European decision to restructure Greek debt,\" Stefanou said. Nicos Anastasiades, the right-wing front runner to win next month's elections in Cyprus, said he was keen to implement an economic reform plan. However Anastasiades also indicated he would not prioritise the privatisations of state assets - a key demand of international lenders.",

      "bodyText": "Jessops, which this week became the latest casualty of the economic downturn, is unlikely to be the last household-name retailer to struggle for survival this year as experts warn that 2013 will prove even harder on Britain's atrophying high streets than 2012. The camera chain's fall into administration follows the failure last year of a string of big names including Barratts, Peacocks, Game, Clinton Cards, Comet, Allders and JJB Sports, and the demise in 2009 of the once-great Woolworths chain. With British Retail Consortium (BRC) figures showing that one in nine high street shops stand empty, there are fears that specialist retailers such as Jessops are facing unprecedented challenges as they try to contend with online competitors and increasingly squeezed consumers. Jessops' mistake was investing too heavily in the digital camera boom as smartphones took off and internet retail blossomed, according to analysts. \"Jessops expanded on the back of that wave and the problem is that if you expand on the back of a bubble, if that bubble ever bursts and you're a specialist, single-product retailer, you're very exposed,\" said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at Conlumino. \"That's exactly what happened with Jessops: they struggled over quite a long period of time and they had a lot of debt as well, and eventually I think the business was just seen as being quite unsustainable.\" Despite trying to rebalance itself by offering other products and services, said Saunders, Jessops never quite managed it. \"We've seen this pattern replicated many times before and it's been shown to be true in music and video \u2013 especially where the product is becoming digitalised \u2013 and it is true in books to a lesser extent.\" Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb put Jessops' failure in still starker terms. \"If people are using smartphones and tablets to email photos around on social media sites, then who needs a specialist camera? Professional photographers can shop online for that kind of thing.\" Specialist retailers, whatever their products, had to be wary of \"their niche becoming a tomb\", he said. Experts are downbeat about the average high street's prospects over the next 12 months. Saunders predicted a lot more gaps as the high street struggles with a falling number of visitors with a decreasing amount of money in their pockets. He also believes that some specialist music and video retailers will follow Jessops into administration. HMV, which reported a half-year loss of \u00a337m in December, on Thursday announced a month-long sales promotion which will see prices reduced by 25%. Bubb added: \"I think we'll see a number of players consolidating store numbers, and that bodes very badly for secondary and tertiary high streets or the less prosperous locations, and I think we will see high streets struggling to attract footfall.\" He agreed that while the big shopping-cum-entertainment centres such as Westfield, Bluewater and Lakeside would continue to do well because that is where all the consumers and retailers want to be, more modest high streets would suffer. \"If you're talking about Margate high street or Barnsley high street, they will continue to be full of betting shops and discount shops and pound shops and charity shops.\" However, both analysts pointed out that some big-name players, including John Lewis, House of Fraser and Debenhams, had managed to weather the economic storm and did well over Christmas by successfully integrating their physical and online operations. Saunders said: \"It's very clear that where you do tie the two things together, they do work. What retailers need to do is not to see their operations as about stores and online but to see it as a seamless whole and then decide what they need to do to bring their products to market: how many stores they need and how the internet fits in with that.\" Richard Dodd, head of media and campaigns for the BRC, also counselled against treating the internet as the enemy of the high street shop. Were it not for strong online sales in December, he said, there would have been no positive spending growth across the retail sector as a whole. \"When you strip out the online element from overall retail sales, it's clear that store sales in December were actually down on 12 months earlier,\" he said. \"It's wrong to start thinking that [internet retail] is the prime cause of the difficulty: it's actually an opportunity and route to salvation.\" Dodd feels the government could take bolder steps to support the ailing high street: the BRC wants the coalition to help retailers by announcing a freeze on business rates in April. Like his fellow analysts, Richard Hyman, a retail consultant at Patel Miller, has no doubt that 2013 will be a bleaker year for the British high street than 2012 with more shops set to close. \"By the end of this year, there'll be quite a few more names that won't be there any more because there are too many mouths to feed and too many companies that are not really fit for purpose,\" he said. Hyman believes high street retailers have been overly reliant on outdated business and management models. He warned that the slow deaths of high street giants will continue until the entire sector takes the time to re-examine the relationship between supplier, retailer and consumer. \"This is the Pandora's box that the internet has opened for retailing. I don't for one moment think that retailing's going to disappear, but I do think that its future will be quite different and that some really fundamental revisiting of the model needs to take place to establish scalable and sustainable businesses.\"",

In a lengthy answer, Rohner cast doubt on the strategy of hiring big teams to poach business. \"When you grow a business too quickly, you hire people from many different places and some of them \u2026 you really have to qualify as mercenaries,\" Rohner said in a rare public appearance. He insisted that the Libor-rigging had not been brought to his attention \u2013 even though he had made a presentation in 2007 boasting about the bank's \"structured Libor\" business. The three other former UBS bankers who appeared all insisted they had also read about Libor after they left and were not interviewed by regulators. Rohner said he was \"shocked\" when he read about the manipulation of Libor. \"I felt embarrassed and ashamed,\" he said. Accused of failing to spot the \"epic\" scandal, Rohner said he had done his best. He admitted \"accountability\" for the manipulation of Libor and described decision-making at UBS as a \"complete nightmare\" and like \"squaring of a circle\". But he did not support the idea of breaking up banks. In a later session, Hector Sants, chief executive of the Financial Services Authority until days before the Barclays Libor fine, told the commission that only nine of the 40 individuals who knew of UBS's Libor-rigging fell into the FSA's jurisdiction. Sants is poised to join Barclays as head of compliance this month and pledged to change the culture at the bank, indicating that he would set up a committee to focus on its culture. \"Banks have got to change and one key issue that's got to change is the culture. If I can do that I believe I'll have made a good contribution,\" he saidSants, who was knighted in the New Year's honours list and is expected to be on a \u00a33m a year package at Barclays.",

He never seemed to think he had as much power as he really did. As Vogue tells one revealing anecdote that shows how Geithner never really thought he could throw his weight around: \"On a recent business trip, Geithner and his entourage were trying to decide where to eat dinner. An aide suggested a popular restaurant, but Geithner nixed the idea, saying they'd never get a table. The aide laughs at the memory: 'I mean, he's the secretary of the Treasury! He could get a table.'\"</p> <p>Lew was clearly happy to get the treasury nomination. Geithner fought it, then spent four grudging years in treasury, two of them openly trying to escape the institution. If there was one movie moment that could describe the four-year career of Timothy Geithner as treasury secretary, it would be this despairing exclamation from The Godfather, Part III: \"Just when I thought I was out, they keep pulling me back in!\"</p> <p>Geithner was an odd fit for Treasury, a fact Obama noted: \"I couldn't blame Tim when he told me he wasn't the right guy for the job.\" A Spock-like economic wonk used to the civilized stone halls of the New York Federal Reserve bank, Geithner was dragged in 2009 into one of the most ill-starred tenures of any modern US treasury Secretary. From the financial crisis, to Tarp, to AIG, to not one but two immature congressional fights over lifting the US debt ceiling, he lived the exasperated query from Dorothy Parker: \"What fresh hell is this?\"</p> <p>The White House kept thwarting him, but finally gave in. \"I understand that Tim is ready for a break,\" President Obama said, in one of the great political understatements of our time. By August of 2009 \u2013 less than a year in the job \u2013 Geithner was caught in a screaming, profanity-laden rant in a meeting with Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and other regulators. He made quick enemies of Tarp inspector Neil Barofsky and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation chair Sheila Bair, both of whom wrote books casting Geithner in a bad light.</p> <p>Part of Geithner's problem in Washington is that it was easy to tell which button to push to drive him crazy: his legacy. The suggestion that he is cozy with Wall Street that seems to drive Geithner over the edge, even now. In an appearance on Charlie Rose's television show, Geithner responded to the charges that he is too cozy with Wall Street by saying, \"You know, I'm deeply offended by that,\" Geithner said. \"I find that deeply offensive.\" Bair dubbed him the \"bailouter in chief.\"</p> <p>Barofsky, who openly suggested Geithner was trying to thwart his oversight of Tarp, chronicled a Geithner rant: 'No one has ever made the banks disclose the type of shit that I made them disclose after the stress tests. No one! And now you're saying that I haven't been fucking transparent?' \u2026 Neil, I have been the most fucking transparent secretary of the treasury in this country's entire fucking history!\" According to Barofsky, a press aide later whispered that he expected Geithner to throw a punch.</p> <p>It's tempting for anyone \u2013 not just Geithner and Barofsky \u2013 to say \"goodbye to all that.\" No one likes to be in a constant crisis mindset; it is the opposite of a civilized society if we are. But that crisis mindset could have been useful, if it had pushed financial reform a little harder. Geithner, to some extent, was willing to take the punches necessary to connect Washington and Wall Street.</p> <p>That connection is essential. Jack Lew, because of his love of budgets and deficit planning, seems likely to let that tenuously built bridge between Wall Street and Washington decay. His strengths are in the molasses-speed world of government deficits and budget planning, where costs are calculated in increments of a year or a decade. He is largely uninterested in Wall Street, and unbendable in some cases.</p> <p>Congressional Republicans have derided Lew as \"an uncompromising know-it-all,\" in the words of a newspaper profile on him last month. Whereas Geithner spoke the language of Wall Street \u2013 including its tone, with yelling and profanity \u2013 Lew speaks the language of the political court. He reportedly yelled once, chastely, about Medicaid \u2013 and then <a href=\"http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-09/lew-taking-over-at-treasury-puts-perennial-aide-at-head.html\">felt immediately embarrassed after</a>.</p> <p>To the administration, Lew's storied history in budgets is only a plus. As President Obama nominated him, he made sure to mention that Lew had presided over three budget surpluses.

They're a tapestry, the fabric of what we believe. The numbers tell a story, a self-portrait of what we are as a country.\" </p> <p>That is beautifully said, and also true. But inevitably, this means when the next financial crisis comes \u2013 and it will, because it always does \u2013 everyone will ask something along the lines of \"why wasn't anyone paying attention?\"</p> <p>Here's the answer: because we did once, and then got bored before we finished the job.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer endured a tumultuous trading session as a panicky reaction to the surprise release of Christmas trading figures wiped nearly \u00a3300m off the retailer's value, but the group clawed back most of the losses by the close of the day. At one point investors knocked more than 5% off the value of M&amp;S. The shares recovered, closing down 2.2p at 368.8p. A rattled M&amp;S chief executive, Marc Bolland, took the unusual step of releasing figures 12 hours ahead of schedule after the results, showing a 1.8% fall in sales over the festive period, were leaked. Jeremy Batstone-Carr, an analyst at Charles Stanley, described the figures as \"slightly disappointing\", paring back his earnings valuation on the stock by a small amount. There are no indications yet of unusual trading patterns around the alleged leaking of price sensitive figures. Data Explorers, the research firm which monitors trading behaviour associated with short selling, said many short sellers had appeared to lose interest in M&amp;S a while ago. The percentage of stock on loan \u2014 a key measure of short-seller interest \u2014 peaked at 6.5% in May and had been flat, at just under 3%, for some time. Figures were available up to Monday of this week. A short seller looks to profit from a drop in a share price. Bolland insisted in a hastily-arranged conference call with reporters on Wednesday night that M&amp;S had not issued a profits warning, despite reporting a 1.8% fall in overall sales for the 13 weeks to 29 December. M&amp;S declined to comment on whether an investigation into the early release was under way. \"Our priority is to communicate the results to the market, and give people a fair stab at analysing them,\" it said. Since joining the firm in May 2010 Bolland has shaken up the management team \u2013 with fashion boss Kate Bostock departing last autumn.",

The shares recovered, closing down 2.2p at 368.8p.</p> <p>A rattled M&amp;S chief executive, Marc Bolland, took the unusual step of releasing figures 12 hours ahead of schedule after the results, showing a 1.8% fall in sales over the festive period, were leaked.</p> <p>Jeremy Batstone-Carr, an analyst at Charles Stanley, described the figures as \"slightly disappointing\", paring back his earnings valuation on the stock by a small amount.</p> <p>There are no indications yet of unusual trading patterns around the alleged leaking of price sensitive figures. Data Explorers, the research firm which monitors trading behaviour associated with short selling, said many short sellers had appeared to lose interest in M&amp;S a while ago. The percentage of stock on loan \u2014 a key measure of short-seller interest \u2014 peaked at 6.5% in May and had been flat, at just under 3%, for some time. Figures were available up to Monday of this week. A short seller looks to profit from a drop in a share price.</p> <p>Bolland insisted in a hastily-arranged conference call with reporters on Wednesday night that M&amp;S had not issued a profits warning, despite reporting a 1.8% fall in overall sales for the 13 weeks to 29 December.</p> <p>M&amp;S declined to comment on whether an investigation into the early release was under way. \"Our priority is to communicate the results to the market, and give people a fair stab at analysing them,\" it said. Since joining the firm in May 2010 Bolland has shaken up the management team \u2013 with fashion boss Kate Bostock departing last autumn.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Office for National Statistics has bowed to fierce lobbying by pensioner groups and backed away from radical changes to the way inflation is calculated that could have depressed retirement payouts. Jil Matheson, the UK's national statistician, surprised the City on Thursday when she announced that the ONS had rejected a proposal to alter the way the RPI, the time-honoured measure of inflation, is calculated, despite acknowledging that it tends to systematically overestimate inflation. After a two-year review, the ONS said that while it will still produce the RPI \u2013 to which many index-linked bonds, pensions and other long-term contracts are tied \u2013 it is constructed in a way that is out of line with international best practice, and does not give a good measure of the increase in the cost of living. From March, the ONS will publish a new inflation index, the RPIJ, based on a different way of averaging prices, known as a Jevons average, which it believes is superior to the current method, known as a \"Carli average\". Given the questions about how it is calculated, the UK Statistics Authority will also review the RPI and decide whether it should be stripped of its \"national statistic\" badge. Asked whether she thought the government should switch to the RPIJ for calculating payments on government bonds, rail fares and the many other decisions currently based on RPI, Matheson said: \"It is in the hands of users to decide which index they use\". She rejected the more radical option of changing the way the main RPI index is calculated, overturning the views of the ONS's consumer prices advisory committee, after public consultations revealed that users of statistics were overwhelmingly against the move, with 82% of respondents calling for no change in the methodology. Pensioners' groups had lobbied particularly hard against the change. Many pensioner benefits are pegged to the RPI. There was also a possibility of high-profile legal challenges from aggrieved groups if the method for calculating the RPI had been altered. Matheson said: \"We acknowledge that the RPI in its current form doesn't meet international standards; however, what we also have to do is to take account of user needs.\" Joanne Segers, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds, said: \"Pension funds are relieved that RPI has been left intact because rewiring this crucial measure would have created upheaval for both inflation-linked pension fund investments and the income of current and future pensioners.\" Some commentators argued that the ONS's approach would sow confusion, however. \"It seems that now we will have the worst of both worlds \u2013 the flawed RPI will continue to be used but its flaws will be highlighted each month by the publication in tandem of a new RPIJ index which makes the methodological changes that had previously been recommended to remove the RPI's undesirable statistical properties,\" said Brian Hilliard, of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, adding: \"What a mess\" The Treasury said that not only would future payments on so-called index-linked gilts \u2013 which protect savers against inflation \u2013 continue to be calculated according to the RPI, but new gilts would also still be pegged to the old measure. Index-linked gilts rallied on financial markets after the news. The economic secretary to the Treasury, Sajid Javid, left open the possibility that the government might use the new measure for other purposes. \"The government will consider any implications of the national statistician's announcement on its approach to RPI indexation across different policy areas in due course,\" he said. George Osborne has already shifted the uprating of many benefits to the consumer price index, the internationally comparable measure of inflation targeted by the Bank of England, which tends to be up to a percentage point lower than RPI. In his December autumn statement, Osborne went even further, putting a controversial 1% cap on many payments.",

      "body": "<p>Tesco is \"back on form\", according to its chief executive, Philip Clarke, after the supermarket giant claimed victory over the Christmas trading period, sparking counter-claims from arch-rival Sainsbury's.</p> <p>In a riposte to Sainsbury's claim on Wednesday that it was the \"clear winner\" of the festive season after posting a 0.9% increase in like-for-like sales, Tesco announced a 1.8% rise in like-for-like sales \u2013 although that was over a shorter six-week period.</p> <p>The seething rivalry between the two erupted further, when a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2013/jan/10/tesco-sainsburys-christmas-trading-row\" title=\"\">Sainsbury's executive sent analysts an email questioning Tesco's figures</a>. According to Sky News, the email accused Tesco of being \"a bit disingenuous\" with its figures because they use an accounting guideline that includes payments with Clubcard vouchers. A Tesco source said the group had used the same standard in past results statements.</p> <p>Despite the row, Tesco shares closed nearly 2% higher at 353.4p, while Sainsbury's shares headed down 1% to 325.7p.</p> <p>John Ibbotson, director of the consultants Retail Vision, said: \"The crucial like-for-like number is flattered somewhat by Tesco's dire performance over Christmas 2011, but it does confirm both a return to form and a decisive victory over rivals Sainsbury's and Morrisons.\"</p> <p>Last January, Britain's biggest retailer shocked the City with its first profit warning in more than 20 years, leading to the departure of Richard Brasher as head of its UK arm. Clarke set out a three-year plan to turn the group around and took over day-to-day running of the UK business.</p> <p>On Thursday he stepped back from that post, announcing the appointment of Tesco veteran Chris Bush as UK managing director. \"With the UK plan under way it's right for me to step back a little from day-to-day management of the UK business,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We're back on form, with like-for-like sales growing at the strongest rate for three years.\" But he warned that there was still much to be done. \"This was only a six-week period. Christmas is just one step on the way.\"</p> <p>He would not say whether sales would continue to grow. \"The future is somewhat uncertain. You've seen how hard-pressed consumers are. I don't know what like-for-likes are going to be.

      "bodyText": "Tesco is \"back on form\", according to its chief executive, Philip Clarke, after the supermarket giant claimed victory over the Christmas trading period, sparking counter-claims from arch-rival Sainsbury's. In a riposte to Sainsbury's claim on Wednesday that it was the \"clear winner\" of the festive season after posting a 0.9% increase in like-for-like sales, Tesco announced a 1.8% rise in like-for-like sales \u2013 although that was over a shorter six-week period. The seething rivalry between the two erupted further, when a Sainsbury's executive sent analysts an email questioning Tesco's figures. According to Sky News, the email accused Tesco of being \"a bit disingenuous\" with its figures because they use an accounting guideline that includes payments with Clubcard vouchers. A Tesco source said the group had used the same standard in past results statements. Despite the row, Tesco shares closed nearly 2% higher at 353.4p, while Sainsbury's shares headed down 1% to 325.7p. John Ibbotson, director of the consultants Retail Vision, said: \"The crucial like-for-like number is flattered somewhat by Tesco's dire performance over Christmas 2011, but it does confirm both a return to form and a decisive victory over rivals Sainsbury's and Morrisons.\" Last January, Britain's biggest retailer shocked the City with its first profit warning in more than 20 years, leading to the departure of Richard Brasher as head of its UK arm. Clarke set out a three-year plan to turn the group around and took over day-to-day running of the UK business. On Thursday he stepped back from that post, announcing the appointment of Tesco veteran Chris Bush as UK managing director. \"With the UK plan under way it's right for me to step back a little from day-to-day management of the UK business,\" he said. \"We're back on form, with like-for-like sales growing at the strongest rate for three years.\" But he warned that there was still much to be done. \"This was only a six-week period. Christmas is just one step on the way.\" He would not say whether sales would continue to grow. \"The future is somewhat uncertain. You've seen how hard-pressed consumers are. I don't know what like-for-likes are going to be. I expect we will become more competitive.\" There was some concern among analysts that Tesco had cut one percentage point from its profit margin in order to win such strong sales growth, with heavy discounting and the use of vouchers. Clarke said: \"We always said we'd do more coupons. But the improvement is broadly based, it's across all formats; it's in food, general merchandise and clothing. That shows we got it right at Christmas.\" Conditions remained tough, he said, noting that customers were opting for a mixture of high-end and value products. Tesco Finest and the recently relaunched Everyday Value range outperformed the rest of the business, with rapid sales of own brand Premier Cru champagne and turkeys. Sales of general merchandise \u2013 which includes clothing and other non-food products \u2013 was better than in the third quarter but continued to drag on growth. Clarke said there was still an \"enormous amount to do\" in this area, both in stores and online. Group sales in the period rose 3.9%, excluding petrol. Shoppers increasingly opted for home delivery, sending online food sales up by 18% in the six weeks to 5 January.

      "bodyText": "And with that, I'm finished. As expected, the ECB press conference was the main event in the eurozone - which has managed to send the euro ralling. Highlights from 1.29pm. Back tomorrow morning, and I promise to be earlier.... Goodnight! Our full story on Germany's threat to the UK over a referendum is live here: Germany tells Cameron: don't blackmail the EU A late update from Greece, where finance minister Yannis Stournaras was remarkably upbeat about the country's situation. Stournaras declared that: The Greek economy will make a giant step to restore its competitiveness....If this trend continues it is probable that 2013 will be the first year after decades that the current account will be about balanced.. Germany has become the latest country to urge Britain not to risk its EU membership, piling even more pressure on David Cameron. The head of the German parliament's influential European Union Affairs Committee warned Britain not to \"blackmail\" other countries in its push to fashion a new relationship with Europe. Gunther Krichbaum added that any In-Out referendum could leave UK isolated and hamper moves towards closer European integration: On a visit to London, Krichbaum said: You cannot create a political future if you are blackmailing other states. That will not help Britain. It needs a Europe that is stable. It needs markets that are functioning. In the broader sense of negotiating a new treaty, it is neither wise nor useful to open Pandora's box, because every state in the EU, not just Britain, would again try to get their interests in. With the US, Ireland and Brussels top officials all voicing concerns, Cameron's big speech on Europe gets ever more interesting..... The euro is hitting new highs this evening, now up two cents against the US dollar at $1.3263. Anyone who was 'short the euro' in anticipation of a rate cut soon is nursing burnt fingers tonight. Reuters has helpfully published a round-up of the best quotes from Mario Draghi -- HIGHLIGHTS-Draghi comments at ECB news conference The Greek finance ministry has reported that Greece's central government budget deficit shrank by a third in 2012. The budget gap (which doesn't include social security payments or the cost of running local government services) dropped by 30% to \u20ac15.91bn, from \u20ac22.77bn. That reflects the cutbacks implemented last year, and brings Athens closer to the goal of a primary budget surplus. More developments at the ECB - Mario Draghi has officially unveiled the new \u20ac5 note. It boasts a photo of the ancient Greek goddess Europa, and will come into circulation on May 2* * - assuming the euro lasts that long** ** - only joking, Mr Draghi. More seriously, the ECB says the new note will include special security features to fight counterfeiters, adding that 531,000 fake euro notes were found and removed from circulation last year. That's a 12% drop. UPDATE: here's an actual photo (Europa's head and shoulders can be seen on the right). The rally in Spanish government debt continues... This may be the best \"take-away\" quote from ECB president Mario Draghi during today's press conference (see 1.29pm onwards) There is a positive contagion when things go well and that\u2019s what\u2019s in play now. Last question: Does Mario Draghi see the calming in the markets as a \"personal success\"? He replies: Let me be absolutely clear on this, the jury is still out. It's too early to claim success. And with that, the first ECB press conference of 2013 is over. But as the ECB board stand up and leave, someone leaves the microphones on for a few seconds - enough to hear ECB vice-president V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio tease his boss for his final answer: And the euro rises to $1.32, up 1.3 cents today. Would the ECB consider a Funding for Lending scheme like the one recently created in the UK? Draghi argues that the Long Term Refinancing Operations already run by the ECB are similar, as they allow banks to use a wide range of collateral to borrow from the central bank. We think our scheme is simpler Draghi points out that banks can use loans made using LTRO funds as collateral with the ECB, freeing up fresh capital for more lending. Not everyone thinks that's a good thing.... Finally, someone reminds Draghi that there's an unemployment crisis in Europe. Draghi reminds the room that the ECB doesn't have an explicit mandate to target the jobless rate. He then argues that 'dual labour markets' are being created, with older workers enjoying better job security while young people bear the brunt. He also suggests there are 'structural reasons' behind the youth unemployment crisis, given the huge regional difference that exist within the euro. A central bank can't solve those..... More reaction: An unusual question from the floor -- a journalist launches into an anecdote about how he met a man recently who said his job was in 'waste management', only to explain he was actually a banker charged with valuing \"garbage assets\" in banks. That includes German banks who are valuing toxic debts at 'fantasy values', says said banker. So, Mr Draghi, is there a hidden problem here? Draghi says he doesn't believe this is a significant problem, but concedes that there is more work to do on banks' balance sheets, and that local regulators should keep a close watch on how banks value their assets. Michael Steen of the Financial Times reminds Draghi that he warned that risks remain to the downside. Does that mean that there's now a danger of 'exuberance' (given the recent stock market rally)? Draghi replies that he doesn't see a big danger here: We are back in a normal situation from a financial viewpoint - we are not seeing a strong recovery. But he adds that the ECB is closely watching possible signs of exuberance in certain parts of the financial system. And then the ECB president moves onto a favourite theme - the need for governments to make structural adjustments to fix imbalances in the euro area. That's the only thing that matters. The Q&amp;A continues, and Mario Draghi permits himself the smallest pat on the back. Asked for his views on other central banks, he says that each one carries out its own mandate: Within this each central bank tries to steer private sector expectations...we've shown how to do it. The ECB has now uploaded its full opening statement - here. Here's the summary: To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. Other economic policy areas will need to make further contributions to ensure a firm stabilisation of financial markets and an improvement in the outlook for growth. Further structural reforms should be rapidly implemented to make the euro area a more flexible, dynamic and competitive economy. In particular, product market reforms to increase competition and competitiveness are essential, accompanied by measures to improve the functioning of labour markets. Such reforms will boost the euro area\u2019s growth potential and employment and improve the adjustment capacities of the euro area countries. They will also add further momentum to the progress being made with regard to unit labour costs and current account imbalances. As regards fiscal policies, the recent significant decline in sovereign bond yields should be bolstered by further progress in fiscal consolidation in line with the commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact. Another question - is the European Central Bank considering exiting from its current unorthodox monetary measures, given the recent improvement in market conditions? No. Mario Draghi says the ECB is not planning an exit from non-standard measures, as it sees \"signs of fragmentation in eurozone\". It wants to see cleare signs of recovery first. The Euro has rallied to $1.316 on the news that the ECB was 'unanimous' in its vote to leave eurozone borrowing costs unchanged. Another questioner queries whether the ECB really didn't consider a rate cut \u2013 last month there were clear signs that some board members considered a cut. Draghi reiterates that everyone was on the same page. Draghi's list of improvements (see 13.45pm) ignores Europe's unemployment crisis - where the latest data shows things have got (even) worse. Of course Draghi's mandate is price stability (unlike the US Fed, which has now decided to target the American jobless rate). Question 1) Was the decision unanimous? Yes it was, Draghi replies, and goes on to list several reasons to be optimistic: CDS* rates are lower, stock markets are higher, volatility rates are at recent lows, the deposits in periphery banks are up.... the ECB balance sheet continues to shrink. He adde: All in all we have signs that fragmentation is being repaired... but all this has not made its way through to the real economy yet. * - credit default swaps, used to insure against a bond defaulting Onto questions.... Draghi's summing up statement has a 'steady as she goes' feel. He repeats that inflation is under control, but other players in the crisis must do more to ensure: firm stabilisation for financial markets and an improvement in the outlook for growth. And on the recent rally in bond yields, he predicts further improvements as the eurozone recovery continues. Draghi's statement has a certain familiar ring to it.... On the credit side, Draghi says the situtation is still subdued. The underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued, Mario Draghi continues. Draghi forecasts that the economic recovery will begin this year, as structural reforms and the ECB's own actions bear fruit. Risks, though, remain on the downside, due to the risk of 'slow implemention' of reforms. Draghi adds that it is still essential for national governments to mend the imbalances within the eurozone, and continue with financial sector restructuring. IE: don't relax just because the crisis has eased Mario Draghis begins by predicting that inflationary pressures will be 'contained' over the forecasting horizons, and that expectations are anchored to the ECB's target of CPI inflation close to, but below 2%. He still expects inflation to fall below 2% this year. And we're off.... Draghi starts by wishing everyone a very happy new year The European Central Bank's monthly press conference is just getting underway - remember you can watch it here. Update: actually, the live feed has started but it's just journalists chattering.... A press conference is also underway in Dublin, where Jose Manuel Barroso is visiting to mark the start of the Irish EU presidency. Barroso has apparently repeated his argument that the worst ravages of the eurozone crisis have abated. Tony Connelly of RTE has the key quotes: You can watch the European Central Bank press conference (starting in 15 minutes) live at the ECB's site: Webcast of the press conference 10 January 2013. (I can't find a way of embedding it without it autoplaying, which I know people find annoying, so I won't) Here's the full statement from the ECB: 10 January 2013 - Monetary policy decisions At today\u2019s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.75%, 1.50% and 0.00% respectively. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 2.30 p.m. CET today. Breaking: The European Central Bank has left its interest rates unchanged. That's broadly as expected - though some economists had suspected there could be a shock cut. Kit Juckes of SocGen isn't cheered that sovereign bond and the euro have both strengthened despite the weaknesses in the euro economy. Juckes sees a worrying comparison with another country who suffered a debt crisis, followed by a long stagnation: Really low bond yields and a strong currency despite a huge debt burden, sizeable budget deficit and chronic economic weakness. Yup, the Japanification of the eurozone continues apace. Economists believe that the Bank of England is likely to boost its QE bond-buying programme in the months ahead, having left it unchanged along with interest rates today (see 12.01pm). Nida Ali, economic advisor to the Ernst &amp; Young ITEM Club, argued that the Bank needs to send a clear signal that it will take more action to help the UK economy: In our view, the Bank has been very ambivalent about their policy stance, with members projecting a neutral attitude about whether policy should be loosened or not. We think that, similar to the Fed, the Bank should make a clearer commitment to doing whatever it takes to keep the recovery on track and provide guidance on the likely future path of rates. Jeremy Cook of foreign exchange company World First believes the QE programme could have swelled to \u00a3500bn by the end of 2013. There is also speculation that UK interest rates could stay at their current record low for another four years: The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. There's no change to the quantitative easing progamme either, which remains at \u00a3375bn. Not a surprise. Back in the financial markets, Spanish government debt is rallying following this morning's bond sale. This has pushed the yield on its 10-year bonds below 5% for the first time since March 2012 (currently 4.95%, a fall of 0.165 percentage points). That bolsters the argument that the immediate crisis in the eurozone has eased since last summer, when Spanish debt was trading at 'bailout danger zone levels' above 7%. Cyprus has hit back at Germany following reports yesterday that its bailout could be blocked by the Bundestag because of concerns over money laundering in its banking sector. Government spokesman Stefanos Stefanou has declared that Cyprus is the victim of Greece's debt restructuring (which slashed the value of Greek bonds held by Cypriot banks, leaving a \u20ac10bn+ black hole). Stefanou also rejected Angela Merkel's suggestion that Cyprus could not expect to be treated differently, and must swallow demands for state privatisations. He said: We never asked for special treatment. What we are asking for is an expression of solidarity - which is a basic EU principle - towards a country which is the victim of a European decision to restructure Greek debt. According to Reuters, the decision to apply a haircut to Greek bonds cost Cyprus banks the equivalent of 20% of the country's GDP. The decision to make private investors share the price of the Greek aid package rather backfired on Cyprus.... This graph shows how Greece's unemployment rate has almost doubled over the last two years: That's from the official data, which can be downloaded here. Greek unemployment has hit a record high, data just released shows, in a stern reminder that bond sales are not the only measure of success in dealing with the euro crisis. The Greek jobless rate hit 26.8% in October, up from September's 26.2%. In raw terms, another 36,219 people lost their jobs during the month. Greece now has the highest unemployment rate in the eurozone (followed by Spain with 26.6% in November). Greece's youth jobless crisis also deepened, hitting 56.6%. It has almost doubled in the last three years: The data also shows that women are being disproportionately hit - the female unemployment rate is now 30.4%, compared with 24.1% for men. The successful Spanish and Italian debt auctions have cheered the financial markets, with the euro climbing 0.27% to nudge $1.31 again. Here's some early reaction: More debt auction news, and Italy has followed Spain by selling debt at lower costs. The Italian debt management agency found buyers for \u20ac8.5bn of one-year bonds at average yields of 0.864%, much lower than the 1.456% demanded by investors in the previous auction (in December). Just in: Spain has held a successful bond auction, selling more debt than expected at sharply lower borrowing costs. The Spanish Treasury raised a total of \u20ac5.8bn, beating its own maximum target of \u20ac5bn. And the significant falls in the yields (or interest rates) on the various flavours of bonds showed traders were keen to get their hands on Spanish debt. Here's the details: \u2022 \u20ac3.397bn of two-year bonds at a maximum yield of 2.587% \u2022 \u20ac1.95bn of five-year bonds, at a maximum yield of 4.033%, down from 4.769% in November 2012 \u2022 \u20ac470m of 13-year bonds at a maximum yield of 5.569%, down from 6.218% in July 2011 That's a decent result for Madrid, and shows that the bond-buying programme announced by Mario Draghi last summer is still boosting confidence. Good morning, and welcome to another day of rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events in the world economy. Central bankers are in the spotlight today, with the European Central Bank and the Bank of England both holding their monthly meetings to set monetary policy. We're not expecting any rate cuts (although you can never be sure), but the ECB's press conference at 1.30pm GMT (2.30pm Frankfurt time) will dominate attention. Mario Draghi will give his views on the state of the European economy, and probably field a few telling questions about the eurozone crisis. Will he agree that the worst is over, or renew his pressure on leaders to take decisive action now before panic returns?.... Otherwise, we'll be watching the situation in Cyprus after German politicians warned yesterday that its bailout could be in jeopardy. And Spain is holding a bond sale this morning -- the results will indicate whether Madrid can keep staving off a request for financial help. (ps, sorry for the late start -- was distracted by the drama at Marks &amp; Spencer)",

Further <strong>structural reforms</strong> should be rapidly implemented to make the euro area a more flexible, dynamic and competitive economy. In particular, product market reforms to increase competition and competitiveness are essential, accompanied by measures to improve the functioning of labour markets. Such reforms will boost the euro area\u2019s growth potential and employment and improve the adjustment capacities of the euro area countries.

As regards <strong>fiscal policies</strong>, the recent significant decline in sovereign bond yields should be bolstered by further progress in fiscal consolidation in line with the commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50eec84a95cb42427dba95a9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-01-10T13:55:22.923Z\">1.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Draghi: not ready to stop non-standard measures yet</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another question - is the European Central Bank considering exiting from its current unorthodox monetary measures, given the recent improvement in market conditions?</p> <p>No.</p> <p>Mario Draghi says the ECB is not planning an exit from non-standard measures, as it sees \"signs of fragmentation in eurozone\".

      "bodyText": "There's nothing like Christmas trading figures to bring out the seething rivalry between the big grocers. On Thursday morning it erupted, with a Sainsbury's executive questioning Tesco's like-for-like sales figures. Sainsbury's was undoubtedly feeling the heat, as its briefings led to the chief executive, Justin King, declaring the supermarket chain the \"clear winner\" of the Christmas trading period, one day before Tesco came out with apparently better sales figures. The two chains report on different periods, making a straight comparison impossible. But \u2013 looking at the Christmas trading statements alone \u2013 Tesco enjoyed 1.8% growth in like-for-like sales, excluding petrol, in the six weeks to 5 January, while Sainsbury's saw the same measure of sales tick up by 0.9%, in the 14 weeks to the same date. But is it the same measure of sales? Sky News's Mark Kleinman reported that in an email sent to food retail analysts a senior member of Sainsbury's investor relations team points out that Tesco included sales where customers used Clubcard vouchers. That number does not meet accounting rules under international financial reporting standards (IFRIC) and much further down in the trading statement, Tesco reports the IFRIC-compliant figure of 1.4% sales growth. Sources \u2013 presumably close to Sainsbury's \u2013 told Sky News that if it had used the same accounting benchmark as Tesco and included sales using points under its Nectar loyalty scheme, its growth figure would have been 1.4%. So, under IFRIC, Tesco enjoyed like-for-like sales of 1.4% over the six weeks to 5 January and Sainsbury's 0.9%, over the 14 weeks to the same date. We know that Tesco's like-for-like sales were actually declining up to November, so Sainsbury's claim that it won Christmas may not be so far off the mark after all. When it comes down to it, the row highlights the difficulty of relying on like-for-like figures, rather than profitability. But for that we will have to wait for the next round of reporting. In the meantime, it seems that the share prices continue to react to the headline numbers, with Tesco up by 2% at lunchtime and Sainsbury's down by 0.5%.",

Up to 2,000 jobs are at risk, with administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers admitting that at least some of the 192 stores would close.</p> <p>Our story <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/09/jessops-verge-administration-jobs-risk#show-all\">attracted comments from Jessops staff members both past and present</a>, as well as from consumers, who debated the reasons for its demise and what this means for the future of the high street. </p> <p>We heard from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/11336209\">bronica123</a>, a current Jessops store manager:</p> <blockquote> <p>I am a manager of a small branch of Jessops, and my little store is (was, or may continue to be, who knows?) doing a roaring trade. There's been lots of talk on the news about where Jessops went wrong. But in my opinion it did not put a foot wrong. The new team that took over back in 2009 did all it could to embrace the new consumer habits, with a real push on the buy on line then collect at store process. Jessops never made money on hardware, and always treated cameras as loss leaders in order to get the customer in the shop so we could sell the margin rich products like memory cards, bags and the like. There was a huge emphasis on the photo printing side of the business, with large format in store printing now widely available, very cheap and of superb quality. My store does well because we were very 'local', and as manager I was able to aknowledge that the customer could by cheaper on line, while gently reminding them that a comprehensive aftercare was worth paying that little bit extra for.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <a href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/20496566\">this recent employee</a> added:</p> <blockquote> <p>I worked here in a flagship branch from 2007-2010. Can't remember a single day when there weren't \"administrators\" waiting in the wings to take over. It's the small stores which drag the company down. My store was a superstore and departmentalised and did very well and we always had a good level of trade. Most of my colleagues have now left the company but I hope those that are left are OK</p> </blockquote> <p>We also heard from many former Jessops employees who attempted to explain why the company is now finding itself in difficulty.</p> <p><a href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/20504008\">One was reasonably optimistic about the chain's future:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>I used to work at Jessops. The reasons it led to this were because they can't compete with Amazon and other online stores and also they opened too many new stores and refurbished others too much. They effectively increased costs but saw revenue barely increase. I feel for the staff and my former colleagues who are some of the best people I know but upper management i.e. the directors and board members made ridiculous choices. For example a \u00a31 million (rumoured figure) refit of their New Oxford Street branch only a few years after a previous refit during a time where money is tight was a completely wrong idea. However I don't think they will go under. Canon and the other camera manufacturers may bail them out by buying shares from HSBC (who own jessops) because Jessops is a major launching platform for new cameras and accessories.

      "bodyText": "High street camera chain Jessops became the latest retailer to fall victim of the ongoing economic downturn, and fell into administration on Wednesday. Up to 2,000 jobs are at risk, with administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers admitting that at least some of the 192 stores would close. Our story attracted comments from Jessops staff members both past and present, as well as from consumers, who debated the reasons for its demise and what this means for the future of the high street. We heard from bronica123, a current Jessops store manager: I am a manager of a small branch of Jessops, and my little store is (was, or may continue to be, who knows?) doing a roaring trade. There's been lots of talk on the news about where Jessops went wrong. But in my opinion it did not put a foot wrong. The new team that took over back in 2009 did all it could to embrace the new consumer habits, with a real push on the buy on line then collect at store process. Jessops never made money on hardware, and always treated cameras as loss leaders in order to get the customer in the shop so we could sell the margin rich products like memory cards, bags and the like. There was a huge emphasis on the photo printing side of the business, with large format in store printing now widely available, very cheap and of superb quality. My store does well because we were very 'local', and as manager I was able to aknowledge that the customer could by cheaper on line, while gently reminding them that a comprehensive aftercare was worth paying that little bit extra for. And this recent employee added: I worked here in a flagship branch from 2007-2010. Can't remember a single day when there weren't \"administrators\" waiting in the wings to take over. It's the small stores which drag the company down. My store was a superstore and departmentalised and did very well and we always had a good level of trade. Most of my colleagues have now left the company but I hope those that are left are OK We also heard from many former Jessops employees who attempted to explain why the company is now finding itself in difficulty. One was reasonably optimistic about the chain's future: I used to work at Jessops. The reasons it led to this were because they can't compete with Amazon and other online stores and also they opened too many new stores and refurbished others too much. They effectively increased costs but saw revenue barely increase. I feel for the staff and my former colleagues who are some of the best people I know but upper management i.e. the directors and board members made ridiculous choices. For example a \u00a31 million (rumoured figure) refit of their New Oxford Street branch only a few years after a previous refit during a time where money is tight was a completely wrong idea. However I don't think they will go under. Canon and the other camera manufacturers may bail them out by buying shares from HSBC (who own jessops) because Jessops is a major launching platform for new cameras and accessories. If they go under the manufacturers will not be able to display and demonstrate their new products (with the exception of events etc) and thus sales and profit in the long run might be affected. Either way I wish all the Jessops staff (except upper management of course) the best and hope that whatever happens everything will work out for them. While another felt the flaws in the company's business model were long-standing: I worked in a branch of Jessops about 9 years ago and you could see a lot of the problems coming even then. People came to us because the staff were generally knowledgeable and passionate about photography and knew enough about the cameras we sold to help customers make an informed decision. The problem was that management wasn't particularly interested in cultivating knowledge and a lot of older, highly experienced staff weren't treated well or paid well so they didn't stay. There seemed to be a drive to promote very young people who would do exactly what the often useless middle managers would say even if they lacked the specialist knowledge and experience to be any good at the job. There was a huge boom in sales when digital cameras entered the mainstream and people were replacing film cameras but prices fell, margins fell even faster and it became very difficult to make money selling a camera. The real profit was in accessories like bags, space batteries and the like but it's hard to run a shop on that. We also struggled to get enough stock that was in high demand. Certain camera models would fly off the shelves and would drive sales of add on lenses, flashguns, tripods, etc but we often struggled to get stock. Sadly the company has been on a knife edge for a while. It's very unfortunate for the staff but I'm sure those at the top will do just fine. And a former customer lamented this loss of knowledge and, like many, sympathised with those under thread of redundancy: My experience with Jessops is that as they've expanded they've lost the in-store experts that could have guided you through a purchase or could actually speak the language of a photographer.

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce has appointed the senior City lawyer investigating the Conservative party's cash-for-access scandal to review its anti-corruption procedures following bribery allegations involving the aircraft engine manufacturer in Indonesia and China. Lord Gold, a conservative peer and former head of litigation at City law firm Herbert Smith is to lead a review of the industrial group's compliance procedures after claims about its conduct in emerging markets. Lord Gold has a track record in scrutinising allegations of illicit practices at organisations, having been appointed by David Cameron last year to investigate the Conservative party's fundraising methods after the then party co-treasurer, Peter Cruddas, was filmed boasting that senior donors could dine with the prime minister. Rolls-Royce's guidelines are in the spotlight after the group admitted last month that it was investigating allegations of malpractice in China, Indonesia and other unspecified overseas markets. The allegations were first brought to the attention of the Derby-based group by the Serious Fraud Office. At the time of the announcement Rolls-Royce emphasised its co-operation with the SFO, pointedly condemning any \"improper business conduct of any sort\". However, a former Rolls-Royce employee who blew the whistle on the Indonesian allegations, Dick Taylor, said the claims were \"just one example\" of corruption at his former employer, adding that some cases of malpractice took place as late as 2010. Announcing the appointment of Lord Gold, Rolls-Royce said: \"He is one of the UK's most senior litigators and has extensive experience working at the highest levels with corporations, governments and regulators around the world.\" Having left Herbert Smith after 37 years, including a spell as its senior partner between 2005 and 2010, Lord Gold set up David Gold &amp; Associates, which is advertised on its website as a provider of \"high-level strategic litigation advice, particularly in relation to settlement\". According to the website, Gold's pedigree includes working with the US Department of Justice as \"corporate monitor\" of BAE Systems, the UK defence contractor that has also faced corruption allegations in emerging markets. Rolls-Royce said last month that it had appointed an external law firm, Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, to conduct its own investigation into the concerns raised by the SFO. The group said the inquiry had found \"matters of concern\" in Indonesia, China and other unspecified markets. The SFO has yet to declare whether it will launch a formal investigation. However, in the meantime, allegations related to Rolls-Royce's conduct in China and Indonesia have emerged on the internet, comprised of postings by Taylor and an anonymous blogger operating under the pseudonym \"Soaringdragon\". Taylor had alleged that that Tommy Suharto, the son of the former Indonesian president, was paid $20m (\u00a312m) by Rolls-Royce and given a Rolls-Royce car to persuade the Garuda airline to procure Trent 700 engines in 1990. Soaringdragon claimed that it paid that it paid bribes to an executive involved with two Chinese airlines, related to deals worth a total of $2bn (\u00a31.25bn) with Air China in 2005 and China Eastern in 2010. Speaking last month, the Rolls-Royce chief executive, John Rishton, said: \"I want to make it crystal clear that neither I nor the board will tolerate improper business conduct of any sort and will take all necessary action to ensure compliance. This is a company with exceptional prospects and I will not accept any behaviour that undermines its future success.\"",

      "body": "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer was on Wednesday night forced to admit to a bigger than expected drop in Christmas sales in a hastily arranged trading statement forced out after the stock market had closed.</p> <p>After a potentially damaging leak of the figures, the retailer published <a href=\"http://corporate.marksandspencer.com/page.aspx?pointerid=0df92addad0f475fabbe935a239302d0\" title=\"\">the official numbers</a> almost 12 hours ahead of their scheduled release of 7am on Thursday and left Marc Bolland, the chief executive, facing questions about his continued tenure at the helm of the retailer.</p> <p>Bolland, who joined with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/18/marc-bolland-marks-spencer\" title=\"\">much fanfare from WM Morrison</a> supermarket chain three years ago, admitted that sales of general merchandise, which includes clothing, were \"not yet satisfactory\" but denied the 3.8% fall in the 13 weeks to 29&#xa0;December was \"disappointing\".</p> <p>Neither was it a profits warning, he added. The City had expected sales to fall but not by as much.</p> <p>M&amp;S, which was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/24/marks-and-spencer-takeover-rumours\" title=\"\">hit by speculation last summer that it could be the target of a takeover bid because of its struggling performance</a>, said overall sales were down 1.8%, as the food business had reported like-for-like sales from stores open more than a year up 0.3%.</p> <p>Retail analyst Nick Bubb said the fall in sales was \"much worse than rivals\" such as Debenhams, Next and John Lewis, which he said was a reflection of \"the strength of competition that M&amp;S faces and the weakness of its ranges and instore merchandising\".</p> <p>But Bolland insisted that while sales were down, he had decided to protect the group's profit margins rather than embarking on major promotions during the key shopping period when 7% less had been put on promotion.</p> <p>Heavy discounting by other retailers \u2013 Gap cut some prices by 70% ahead of Christmas \u2013 had not been copied by M&amp;S as it is \"not good for the brand\". He said: \"We're not going to price promote ourselves for the last decimal point [of sales].\"</p> <p>When asked about his future, Bolland responded: \"I can insist I will be there.\" Finance director Alan Stewart said Bolland had the \"full support of the board\" and shareholders were also supportive. Bolland said M&amp;S had a \"very aligned board and strongly aligned management team\".</p> <p>He insisted the food business had performed very well, with record sales over Christmas, although the group painted a cautious outlook for 2013.</p> <p>\"We expect the pressure on consumers' disposable incomes to continue in 2013.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer was on Wednesday night forced to admit to a bigger than expected drop in Christmas sales in a hastily arranged trading statement forced out after the stock market had closed. After a potentially damaging leak of the figures, the retailer published the official numbers almost 12 hours ahead of their scheduled release of 7am on Thursday and left Marc Bolland, the chief executive, facing questions about his continued tenure at the helm of the retailer. Bolland, who joined with much fanfare from WM Morrison supermarket chain three years ago, admitted that sales of general merchandise, which includes clothing, were \"not yet satisfactory\" but denied the 3.8% fall in the 13 weeks to 29 December was \"disappointing\". Neither was it a profits warning, he added. The City had expected sales to fall but not by as much. M&amp;S, which was hit by speculation last summer that it could be the target of a takeover bid because of its struggling performance, said overall sales were down 1.8%, as the food business had reported like-for-like sales from stores open more than a year up 0.3%. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said the fall in sales was \"much worse than rivals\" such as Debenhams, Next and John Lewis, which he said was a reflection of \"the strength of competition that M&amp;S faces and the weakness of its ranges and instore merchandising\". But Bolland insisted that while sales were down, he had decided to protect the group's profit margins rather than embarking on major promotions during the key shopping period when 7% less had been put on promotion. Heavy discounting by other retailers \u2013 Gap cut some prices by 70% ahead of Christmas \u2013 had not been copied by M&amp;S as it is \"not good for the brand\". He said: \"We're not going to price promote ourselves for the last decimal point [of sales].\" When asked about his future, Bolland responded: \"I can insist I will be there.\" Finance director Alan Stewart said Bolland had the \"full support of the board\" and shareholders were also supportive. Bolland said M&amp;S had a \"very aligned board and strongly aligned management team\". He insisted the food business had performed very well, with record sales over Christmas, although the group painted a cautious outlook for 2013. \"We expect the pressure on consumers' disposable incomes to continue in 2013. As a result we remain cautious about the outlook for the year ahead. Our plan is to transform Marks &amp; Spencer from a traditional UK retailer to an international multi-channel retailer. We are making good progress against this plan,\" he said. But it remains to be seen whether the turnaround will be too slow during what is proving to be a challenging period for M&amp;S whose first half profits, published in November, fell for the second year in a row after womenswear sales disappointed. At the time Bolland promised the clothing ranges would become \"much more stylish and more trend-driven\". While this did not appear to have happened in time to attract shoppers over Christmas, he stressed that partywear sales rose 36% in the period. He has previously said it could take until July for the full effects of the new team to become apparent in stores. On Wednesday night Bolland said the new team brought in to oversee clothing, including Belinda Earl, a former Debenhams boss, had been focusing on taking \"full-price sales\". The new team was now managing stocks tightly, \"resulting in slightly less stock into the Christmas sale, and a clean position at the end of the quarter\". He said the spring/summer collection \u2013 just arriving in stores \u2013 was being \"well received by the fashion press\". Over the two key Christmas trading weeks M&amp;S had record food sales of nearly \u00a3330m and outperformed the market by 4%. Adding the extra week to 5 January, to New Year's trading on a comparable basis, total sales were up 0.9%, while over two years growth was 7.3%. \"In an inflationary market, we held our average prices level on last year, giving customers great value at a time when they are managing their budgets carefully,\" M&amp;S said. Analysts will now be deciding whether to downgrade their profits forecast \u2013 where the current lowest end of estimates is around \u00a3665m for when the full year figures are published in May. Bubb said: \"The impact of the disappointing M&amp;S clothing sales will be largely offset by the robust gross margins and extra cost savings, so full-year profit forecasts are unlikely to drift much beyond the bottom end of the current market range.\"",
