      "bodyText": "Treasury plans to hand the Bank of England extra powers to oversee the banking system will give unelected officials too much power, one of the central bank's longest-serving former advisers has warned. Kate Barker said on Wednesday that the steady erosion of democratic control over regulation of the financial system would accelerate under proposals by the coalition government to create a super-watchdog in Threadneedle Street. She said oversight should be the job of the Treasury, based on advice from the Bank of England and other bodies involved in banking regulation. Echoing fears among many MPs that Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King and his successors will control an unwieldy empire of regulatory committees that could challenge the Treasury's democratic mandate, Barker criticised government plans to create a financial policy committee (FPC) alongside the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC), which sets interest rates. \"More policy decisions should be left in the hands of the chancellor, rather than unelected officials at the Bank of England. Mervyn King's successor will be appointed to an unduly powerful role for an unprecedented eight-year term,\" she said. The FPC differs from the work previously carried out at the Financial Services Authority because it aims to \"assess and steer the financial system as a whole, rather than focusing on individual organisations, which will now become the responsibility of the Prudential Regulatory Authority\", she says. For example, FPC members will have the power to restrict mortgage lending if there are concerns about a possible credit bubble, as there was before the 2007 banking crisis. Barker criticises the Treasury for delegating unpopular decisions to the FPC that should be made by parliament. In a report for the thinktank CentreForum, which has strong links to the Liberal Democrats, the long-standing MPC member warns that the MPC's remit is also flawed, because it failed to spot the looming banking crisis in the early part of the last decade. She says the MPC needs to take a broader view of the economy and have a more flexible inflation target of 1%-3%. At the moment, the central bank aims to limit inflation to 2% over a two-year cycle. Proposals to shift most City regulation to the Bank of England has also been criticised by the all-party Treasury select committee, which questioned the democratic processes inside the Bank of England in a report earlier this year. \"The coalition government has certainly sought to be radical in its approach to macroeconomic policy. But it has invented too many different bodies and not looked hard enough at what went wrong in the lead-up to the crisis. Most significantly, it has delegated too much to the Bank of England, which next year will for the first time have a governor appointed for an eight-year term, into a very powerful unelected role,\" Barker said. Barker's report pays tribute to the coalition for creating the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggesting it has increased the credibility of government tax and spending figures, but urges the chancellor to rethink deficit reduction if \"self-defeating\" austerity is to be avoided. Barker's criticism follows a call by outgoing MPC member Adam Posen for the Bank of England to take extra measures to ease credit conditions in the UK and encourage lending. Posen told the BBC Hardtalk programme that the double-dip recession was \"entirely predictable\" after the coalition accelerated the austerity measures adopted by the previous Labour administration. He repeated his condemnation of the Bank's governor for giving public support to the policy change at the time of the last election, though he praised him for reacting quickly to deteriorating economic conditions, especially after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the US, which precipitated the banking crisis in 2008. Posen, who denied that the MPC's remit had created a barrier to bold action, has lobbied for an increase in the Bank's quantitative easing policy, which he said had been under-used in 2010 and 2011. He argued that an earlier expansion of QE, which involves creating money to encourage bank lending, alongside more direct efforts to promote lending to small and medium-sized businesses, would have increased consumer demand, investment and economic growth. In a sweeping criticism of the limited measures taken by the Bank, he said it should buy up mortgages and the debts of non-banking lenders to free the financial system from overwhelming debt burdens. Too often, the MPC had focused on persuading high street banks to lend more rather than considering setting up new banks with a mandate to lend, he warned. \"We should be buying things other than just gilts, such as bundles of private-sector debt and special bonds to finance infrastructure,\" Posen said. \"The funding for lending scheme set up by the Bank is a step in the right direction but I think the central bank should do more to go around the existing banking system.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 23 August 2012 because the original did not make clear that Kate Barker is a former rather than current member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, and the original headline described her as a \"Bank insider\".",

      "bodyText": "The Conservative party is under pressure to return a large donation from Asil Nadir's business empire after the disgraced tycoon was convicted of the theft of nearly \u00a329m. Nadir, who will be sentenced on Thursday, could face 14 years in jail. A jury at the Old Bailey on Wednesday found him guilty on a further seven counts, to add to the three guilty verdicts they reached on Monday, concluding that he had plundered Polly Peck of \u00a328.6m between 1987 and 1990 \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a361.8m today. The conclusion of his trial prompted immediate calls for the Tories to return \u00a3440,000 received from Nadir's collapsed Polly Peck company \u2013 a demand the Tories indicated they would reject. Nadir's conviction will be seen as a rare triumph for the Serious Fraud Office which has pursued Nadir for 22 years. The 71-year-old former financier was one of Britain's most prominent businessmen in the 1980s, only to become one of the country's most prominent fugitives from justice when he fled Britain for northern Cyprus in 1993. Known as The Man from Del Monte after buying the fruit canning company, he returned to London two years ago to face allegations that he had stolen money from the conglomerate he controlled. His wife, Nur, said outside court that Nadir would appeal against the verdict. Nadir was cleared of three offences relating to more than \u00a35m. The case went to trial in January after Nadir was charged with plundering \u00a334m from his Polly Peck International business empire. Prosecutors chose to bring evidence on 13 \"sample\" theft charges before a jury at the Old Bailey. He was accused of transferring money to subsidiaries in Turkey and Northern Cyprus to pay his tax bill, buy gifts for himself and his family and also to buy shares in his own company in order to bolster the stock market price. The case's conclusion will cause some discomfort for David Cameron because former Tory grandees have promised to return money received from Polly Peck if it was proved to be stolen. Labour MP Simon Danczuk called on the Tories to honour a promise made by former prime minister Sir John Major to return donations if the money was \"dishonestly obtained and dishonestly donated\". A Conservative spokesperson said the party would study the court's judgment but declined to confirm that they would repay the cash if it was stolen property. \"The Conservative party has no record of having received donations from Asil Nadir. Donations were received from Polly Peck companies more than 22 years ago; these were accepted in good faith from what was then considered to be a leading British company,\" the spokesman said. Via his companies, Nadir is thought to have been one of the Conservatives' biggest benefactors under Margaret Thatcher, a period in which party donations did not have to be publicly declared. Accountants investigating Polly Peck found that a subsidiary had made a series of donations to the Conservative party between 1985 and 1990, seemingly without the knowledge of the company's board or shareholders. Touche Ross, the administrators of Polly Peck, wrote a letter \u2013 widely reported four years ago \u2013 to the party's central office claiming that \u00a3365,000 came from money defrauded from the Polly Peck empire. \"It is the contention of the administrator that Mr Nadir is liable to repay the sums concerned as a result of his fraud and/or breach of fiduciary duty and/or malfeasance as a director,\" the letter concluded. \"I would urge you to return the donations to Polly Peck so that the creditors can at least obtain some small measure of compensation from this unfortunate affair.\" The nine donations \u2013 three from Polly Peck International, of \u00a325,000 each, and six from a subsidiary, Unipac Packaging Ltd, of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a380,000 \u2013 were paid into the Conservative Industrial Fund, according to reports. Nadir's friend Michael Mates, a minister in the Major government, had to resign after it was discovered that he gave Nadir a watch inscribed: \"Don't let the buggers get you down.\" Prosecutors will ask the judge to impose a sentence in double figures to take into account the large amount stolen and Nadir's 17 years in Cyrpus. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of seven years but the judge could make some sentences consecutive when considering an overall figure. Polly Peck began as a small fashion company but expanded into the food, leisure and electronics industries under Nadir's ownership, growing into a \u00a31.7bn business empire with more than 200 subsidiaries worldwide. In 1989, Polly Peck bought fresh fruit firm Del Monte for $875m. By 1990, it was on the FTSE 100 index and was one of the Stock Exchange's best performing companies but the share price collapsed after the SFO raided the company's offices. The company was left with debts of \u00a3550m. Creditors received a fraction of what they were owed and shareholders received nothing. Nadir, 36th on the Sunday Times Rich List at one time, was arrested but was secretly flown out of Britain in a private plane in May 1993. As Nadir was led away, his 28-year-old wife, Nur, stood on tiptoe to say goodbye to him in the dock. Afterwards she said: \"A guilty man does not come back to face justice of his own accord. My husband came back voluntarily. Polly Peck was his life. He wants justice for himself and for the tens of thousands of shareholders and employees. This unhappy affair is certainly not over yet.\" The Serious Fraud Office said it was \"not yet clear\" how much of the money Nadir stole from Polly Peck International can be recovered. Clare Whitaker, case manager from the SFO, said a claim will be made for compensation, which it is hoped will be given to the administrators of PPI. David Green, director of the SFO, said: \"The conviction of Asil Nadir of theft on a grand scale from a public company 19 years after he fled the jurisdiction is a remarkable achievement.\"",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Prosecutors of Polly Peck tycoon brought just 13 sample theft charges to Old Bailey from mountain of evidence", 
      "body": "<p>After 22 years battling against 76 counts of theft and false accounting, Britain's most notorious white-collar criminal, Asil Nadir, is on Thursday expected to be sentenced to spend most of the rest of his life behind bars.</p> <p>He has been convicted of stealing \u00a328.8m from the Polly Peck empire he built into one of the stock market's largest companies in the three years before its abrupt collapse in 1990.</p> <p>But the true scale of his fraudulent activities in the late 80s is thought to be much larger, with more than \u00a3380m secretly siphoned out of the FTSE 100 group, according to Serious Fraud Office investigators. The mountain of evidence against Nadir meant that prosecutors chose to bring evidence relating to just 13 \"sample\" theft charges before a jury during the seven-month trial at the Old Bailey, which finished on Wednesday.</p> <p>The twists and turns in the 71-year-old tycoon's story read like the chapters of a John Grisham thriller \u2013 lies, conspiracies, forgeries, controversial political donations, a ministerial resignation, as well as allegations of judicial corruption, SFO foul play and MI6 plots.</p> <p>But the most dramatic act in this protracted drama occurred on 4 May 1993, when, despite purportedly having surrendered all passports and his family posting a record bail surety of \u00a33.5m, Nadir asked Peter Dimond, a friend and pilot, to drive him to Compton Abbas airfield in Dorset and fly him to France.</p> <p>From there, Nadir travelled to Turkey and on to Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus \u2013 a territory not recognised by the UK and therefore beyond the reach of the SFO. For the entire journey, he later told Turkish media, he had taken with him a gun, adding that he had been prepared to shoot anyone who tried to block his passage. It was to mark the beginning of a new lifestyle for Nadir, who, despite his great wealth and connections to the political elite of northern Cyprus, remained armed or accompanied by bodyguards throughout his 17 years on the island.</p> <p>Ensconced in his guarded mountain villa, Nadir made no effort to maintain a low profile, inviting British media to visit and regaling them with conspiracy theories about how dark forces within the British establishment had conspired to engineer his downfall by foul means. He could never receive a fair trial in Britain, he said. Reporters were shown around his palatial new home, each of them always introduced with a mischievous grin to his two parrots, Polly and Peck.</p> <p>In his early years in exile, Nadir was joined by figures alleged to have helped with the fraud and his flight from justice, including Dimond and his loyal lieutenant Elizabeth Forsyth, who had been involved in several money transfers. Both Forsyth and Dimond \u2013 eventually returned to the UK and separately found guilty for their roles in the scandal \u2013 had their respective convictions overturned on appeal.</p> <p>Another figure linked to Nadir, Michael Francis, who had a conviction for attempted murder, also found his way to northern Cyprus. He had been involved in concocting a false allegation of a conspiracy to bribe Nadir's trial judge, Justice Tucker, some months before the tycoon's flight from the UK. It was this outlandish claim \u2013 one that Francis later claimed had been made up at the behest of the SFO \u2013 that Nadir was to rely on as an explanation for his flight from justice.</p> <p>Ersin Tatar, a fellow Turkish Cypriot who had been Polly Peck's assistant treasurer, is now finance minister in northern Cyprus. He has never been charged with an offence but was named by the SFO during the trial among a list of Nadir's main helpers.</p> <p>For years, Nadir's escape was chalked up as another dismal failure by the bungling SFO. But suggestions that SFO prosecutors had let Nadir slip through their fingers were wide of the mark. In truth, the agency had bitterly opposed granting him bail, believing Nadir was a strong flight risk. Justice Tucker took a more relaxed view and Nadir was given his liberty.</p> <p>Whoever was to blame, the upshot was the same: for almost two decades it looked as though the former Polly Peck boss would see out his days basking in the sunshine of his Mediterranean hideaway, the one that got away.</p> <p>For reasons still unclear, however, that position changed abruptly two years ago when Nadir signalled in a British newspaper interview that he would be prepared to return to the UK and face justice so long as an undertaking was given not to oppose bail. The move triggered a flurry of excitement at Elm House, the SFO's London headquarters, as investigators rushed to the archives to dust down the Polly Peck files.</p> <p>In yet another bizarre twist, however, those reviewing these faded paperwork began falling ill and it quickly emerged that the documents had become contaminated with a toxic bacteria. All of the papers had to be laboriously photocopied by staff wearing protective clothing. Despite the Nadir case seeming in so many ways to be cursed, the then SFO director Richard Alderman took the brave decision to take up the challenge, agreeing to the terms on which Nadir said he would return.</p> <p>The formalities ironed out, within a few months Britain's best-known white-collar fugitive stepped of a plane at Luton airport in August 2010, accompanied by a pack of hand-picked media selected to join him for the flight. Assembled reporters were told, with customary bravado, that he had returned to battle an \"immense injustice and tremendous abuse of power\".</p> <p>\"It is inconceivable that I would steal from the company I built up \u2026 I have always said that I was innocent and that has given me the courage and the determination to come back.\"</p> <p>The impression of a man of means was maintained as Nadir, accompanied by his 28-year-old wife, Nur, was whisked away in a chauffeur-driven Jaguar with blacked-out windows to the Mayfair flat which has been his home ever since. Subject to a curfew, he was ordered to wear an electronic tag and report to a police station weekly.</p> <p>Before the trial began, Nadir, who had been granted legal aid to fund his defence, instructed his lawyers to apply for charges against him to be thrown out on multiple grounds, rehashing conspiracy theories worked up over decades on the veranda of his villa. He also claimed a weak heart had left him unfit to stand trial. Each of these tall stories were given short shrift by the court.</p> <p>For much of the 80s, Nadir was feted in the City of London as a shining example of a new generation of self-made Thatcherite businessman. At the start of the decade he had folded his Cyprus-based citrus fruit trading business into an ailing stock market-listed rag trade firm based in the East End of London called Polly Peck, in which he had taken a majority interest. There followed a string of deals that saw the group diversify further, branching out into electronics with the launch of Turkish electronics company Vestel, and later acquiring the Del Monte fruit business and taking a majority stake in Japanese firm Sansui Electric.</p> <p>Nadir became a cult figure, and every stockbroker in the Square Mile could rehearse the story: \u00a31,000 invested in Polly Peck in 1979 was worth \u00a31m 10 years later. At its peak, the group was valued at \u00a32.2bn. By the time the first cracks in the Polly Peck story began to surface, Nadir, who started in business as a schoolboy, selling newspapers and razor blades around the eastern Cypriot port of Famagusta, had built an army of fanatically loyal followers who rushed to his defence.</p> <p>A day after the SFO's first raid on the company, Polly Peck directors asked the stock exchange for trading in company shares to be suspended, adding: \"[We] wish to emphasise that the board deplores the recent attacks on its chairman.\" Forsyth also fought back against allegations, declaring : \"I think the SFO is responsible for the collapse in the Polly Peck share price \u2026 A \u00a31.5bn company was virtually wiped out in 24 hours.\" A month later, the company had imploded, owing debts of \u00a3550m.</p> <p>Perhaps the most enduring campaigner on behalf of Nadir was the then Conservative MP and Northern Ireland minister Michael Mates, who ran a high-profile campaign to highlight several procedural flaws in the SFO probe, even suggesting there might be MI6 involvement in the case. Mates insisted he had taken up the matter in the interests of justice and took no view on Nadir's guilt or innocence. Nevertheless, others noted that Nadir had been a major Tory donor, giving \u00a3440,000 to party coffers.</p> <p>Mates's position became even more difficult in the wake of Nadir's dramatic flight from justice, and he eventually chose to step down \u2013 but not before stunning his fellow MPs with a resignation speech savaging the SFO for alleged misconduct and deliberately trying to \"destabilise\" Nadir's defence.</p> <p>But Mates's campaign was undermined after it emerged he had borrowed a car from Nadir's PR adviser. A further hint at a warm relationship between the two came when it emerged Mates had given a watch to Nadir as a birthday present, bearing the inscription: \"Don't let the buggers get you down.\" Nadir later explained he had had an expensive watch removed from his wrist during a raid on his flat in Eaton Square, Belgravia, by his trustees in bankruptcy.</p> <p>During the lengthy Old Bailey trial, Mates was one of the few Nadir allies who gave evidence in his defence \u2013 although he was only able to testify in relation to peripheral issues in the case.</p> <p>At the heart of the Polly Peck fraud was a series of purported transfers to subsidiaries of Polly Peck in Turkey and Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, which the SFO's counsel, Philip Shears QC, said were disguised in order to mask the fact they were for the benefit of Nadir or his associates.</p> <p>In truth, the cash had been spirited away through a Nadir family trust in Jersey and on to Switzerland, where the money went was spent on secretly propping up Polly Peck's shares as well as bankrolling a lavish lifestyle for Nadir and his family. At trial it emerged that among the uses of stolen cash had been payments to race horse trainer Jenny Pitman, the purchase of Cypriot newspapers, a \u00a31m antique fireplace from Christie's, a Ferrari Testarossa and several Mayfair properties as well as his Leicestershire estate Baggrave Hall.</p> <p>Operations in Cyprus and Turkey, especially those of Polly Peck's carton packaging firm Unipac, came to be the main profit generators within the group \u2013 a fact that did not trouble directors or shareholders for many years. However, these were also divisions over which Nadir had almost total control, out of the prying eyes of his fellow directors.

      "bodyText": "After 22 years battling against 76 counts of theft and false accounting, Britain's most notorious white-collar criminal, Asil Nadir, is on Thursday expected to be sentenced to spend most of the rest of his life behind bars. He has been convicted of stealing \u00a328.8m from the Polly Peck empire he built into one of the stock market's largest companies in the three years before its abrupt collapse in 1990. But the true scale of his fraudulent activities in the late 80s is thought to be much larger, with more than \u00a3380m secretly siphoned out of the FTSE 100 group, according to Serious Fraud Office investigators. The mountain of evidence against Nadir meant that prosecutors chose to bring evidence relating to just 13 \"sample\" theft charges before a jury during the seven-month trial at the Old Bailey, which finished on Wednesday. The twists and turns in the 71-year-old tycoon's story read like the chapters of a John Grisham thriller \u2013 lies, conspiracies, forgeries, controversial political donations, a ministerial resignation, as well as allegations of judicial corruption, SFO foul play and MI6 plots. But the most dramatic act in this protracted drama occurred on 4 May 1993, when, despite purportedly having surrendered all passports and his family posting a record bail surety of \u00a33.5m, Nadir asked Peter Dimond, a friend and pilot, to drive him to Compton Abbas airfield in Dorset and fly him to France. From there, Nadir travelled to Turkey and on to Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus \u2013 a territory not recognised by the UK and therefore beyond the reach of the SFO. For the entire journey, he later told Turkish media, he had taken with him a gun, adding that he had been prepared to shoot anyone who tried to block his passage. It was to mark the beginning of a new lifestyle for Nadir, who, despite his great wealth and connections to the political elite of northern Cyprus, remained armed or accompanied by bodyguards throughout his 17 years on the island. Ensconced in his guarded mountain villa, Nadir made no effort to maintain a low profile, inviting British media to visit and regaling them with conspiracy theories about how dark forces within the British establishment had conspired to engineer his downfall by foul means. He could never receive a fair trial in Britain, he said. Reporters were shown around his palatial new home, each of them always introduced with a mischievous grin to his two parrots, Polly and Peck. In his early years in exile, Nadir was joined by figures alleged to have helped with the fraud and his flight from justice, including Dimond and his loyal lieutenant Elizabeth Forsyth, who had been involved in several money transfers. Both Forsyth and Dimond \u2013 eventually returned to the UK and separately found guilty for their roles in the scandal \u2013 had their respective convictions overturned on appeal. Another figure linked to Nadir, Michael Francis, who had a conviction for attempted murder, also found his way to northern Cyprus. He had been involved in concocting a false allegation of a conspiracy to bribe Nadir's trial judge, Justice Tucker, some months before the tycoon's flight from the UK. It was this outlandish claim \u2013 one that Francis later claimed had been made up at the behest of the SFO \u2013 that Nadir was to rely on as an explanation for his flight from justice. Ersin Tatar, a fellow Turkish Cypriot who had been Polly Peck's assistant treasurer, is now finance minister in northern Cyprus. He has never been charged with an offence but was named by the SFO during the trial among a list of Nadir's main helpers. For years, Nadir's escape was chalked up as another dismal failure by the bungling SFO. But suggestions that SFO prosecutors had let Nadir slip through their fingers were wide of the mark. In truth, the agency had bitterly opposed granting him bail, believing Nadir was a strong flight risk. Justice Tucker took a more relaxed view and Nadir was given his liberty. Whoever was to blame, the upshot was the same: for almost two decades it looked as though the former Polly Peck boss would see out his days basking in the sunshine of his Mediterranean hideaway, the one that got away. For reasons still unclear, however, that position changed abruptly two years ago when Nadir signalled in a British newspaper interview that he would be prepared to return to the UK and face justice so long as an undertaking was given not to oppose bail. The move triggered a flurry of excitement at Elm House, the SFO's London headquarters, as investigators rushed to the archives to dust down the Polly Peck files. In yet another bizarre twist, however, those reviewing these faded paperwork began falling ill and it quickly emerged that the documents had become contaminated with a toxic bacteria. All of the papers had to be laboriously photocopied by staff wearing protective clothing. Despite the Nadir case seeming in so many ways to be cursed, the then SFO director Richard Alderman took the brave decision to take up the challenge, agreeing to the terms on which Nadir said he would return. The formalities ironed out, within a few months Britain's best-known white-collar fugitive stepped of a plane at Luton airport in August 2010, accompanied by a pack of hand-picked media selected to join him for the flight. Assembled reporters were told, with customary bravado, that he had returned to battle an \"immense injustice and tremendous abuse of power\". \"It is inconceivable that I would steal from the company I built up \u2026 I have always said that I was innocent and that has given me the courage and the determination to come back.\" The impression of a man of means was maintained as Nadir, accompanied by his 28-year-old wife, Nur, was whisked away in a chauffeur-driven Jaguar with blacked-out windows to the Mayfair flat which has been his home ever since. Subject to a curfew, he was ordered to wear an electronic tag and report to a police station weekly. Before the trial began, Nadir, who had been granted legal aid to fund his defence, instructed his lawyers to apply for charges against him to be thrown out on multiple grounds, rehashing conspiracy theories worked up over decades on the veranda of his villa. He also claimed a weak heart had left him unfit to stand trial. Each of these tall stories were given short shrift by the court. For much of the 80s, Nadir was feted in the City of London as a shining example of a new generation of self-made Thatcherite businessman. At the start of the decade he had folded his Cyprus-based citrus fruit trading business into an ailing stock market-listed rag trade firm based in the East End of London called Polly Peck, in which he had taken a majority interest. There followed a string of deals that saw the group diversify further, branching out into electronics with the launch of Turkish electronics company Vestel, and later acquiring the Del Monte fruit business and taking a majority stake in Japanese firm Sansui Electric. Nadir became a cult figure, and every stockbroker in the Square Mile could rehearse the story: \u00a31,000 invested in Polly Peck in 1979 was worth \u00a31m 10 years later. At its peak, the group was valued at \u00a32.2bn. By the time the first cracks in the Polly Peck story began to surface, Nadir, who started in business as a schoolboy, selling newspapers and razor blades around the eastern Cypriot port of Famagusta, had built an army of fanatically loyal followers who rushed to his defence. A day after the SFO's first raid on the company, Polly Peck directors asked the stock exchange for trading in company shares to be suspended, adding: \"[We] wish to emphasise that the board deplores the recent attacks on its chairman.\" Forsyth also fought back against allegations, declaring : \"I think the SFO is responsible for the collapse in the Polly Peck share price \u2026 A \u00a31.5bn company was virtually wiped out in 24 hours.\" A month later, the company had imploded, owing debts of \u00a3550m. Perhaps the most enduring campaigner on behalf of Nadir was the then Conservative MP and Northern Ireland minister Michael Mates, who ran a high-profile campaign to highlight several procedural flaws in the SFO probe, even suggesting there might be MI6 involvement in the case. Mates insisted he had taken up the matter in the interests of justice and took no view on Nadir's guilt or innocence. Nevertheless, others noted that Nadir had been a major Tory donor, giving \u00a3440,000 to party coffers. Mates's position became even more difficult in the wake of Nadir's dramatic flight from justice, and he eventually chose to step down \u2013 but not before stunning his fellow MPs with a resignation speech savaging the SFO for alleged misconduct and deliberately trying to \"destabilise\" Nadir's defence. But Mates's campaign was undermined after it emerged he had borrowed a car from Nadir's PR adviser. A further hint at a warm relationship between the two came when it emerged Mates had given a watch to Nadir as a birthday present, bearing the inscription: \"Don't let the buggers get you down.\" Nadir later explained he had had an expensive watch removed from his wrist during a raid on his flat in Eaton Square, Belgravia, by his trustees in bankruptcy. During the lengthy Old Bailey trial, Mates was one of the few Nadir allies who gave evidence in his defence \u2013 although he was only able to testify in relation to peripheral issues in the case. At the heart of the Polly Peck fraud was a series of purported transfers to subsidiaries of Polly Peck in Turkey and Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, which the SFO's counsel, Philip Shears QC, said were disguised in order to mask the fact they were for the benefit of Nadir or his associates. In truth, the cash had been spirited away through a Nadir family trust in Jersey and on to Switzerland, where the money went was spent on secretly propping up Polly Peck's shares as well as bankrolling a lavish lifestyle for Nadir and his family. At trial it emerged that among the uses of stolen cash had been payments to race horse trainer Jenny Pitman, the purchase of Cypriot newspapers, a \u00a31m antique fireplace from Christie's, a Ferrari Testarossa and several Mayfair properties as well as his Leicestershire estate Baggrave Hall. Operations in Cyprus and Turkey, especially those of Polly Peck's carton packaging firm Unipac, came to be the main profit generators within the group \u2013 a fact that did not trouble directors or shareholders for many years. However, these were also divisions over which Nadir had almost total control, out of the prying eyes of his fellow directors. Unipac was run by Nadir's brother-in-law and was not audited by Polly Peck's accountants, Stoy Hayward. Nadir's fellow directors and the company's auditors were fooled into thinking money had been switched from London to subsidiaries in northern Cyprus and Turkey. Later, after serious concerns eventually surfaced, Nadir claimed that hundreds of millions of pounds flowing out of the London parent company had been matched by cash deposits put back into the group via a northern Cyprus subsidiary. Shears attacked these claims, suggesting they were based on lies and forgeries. He said Nadir's assertion that huge cash deposits were made by, or on behalf of, Nadir's elderly mother into an account at Industrial Bank of Kibris (IBK), a small bank privately owned by the former Polly Peck executive chairman, were implausible. One document purporting to be a bank slip appeared to detail a deposit of 148.8m Turkish lire denominated in 100 lire bank notes. \"Such a huge quantity of bank notes is likely to have weighed approximately 135,185kg \u2013 over 135 tonnes,\" said Shears. \"As for the space taken up by such a volume of bank notes \u2013 if all the notes were piled on top of each other they would reach something like 300 times the height of Nelson's column.\" Nadir spent last night in Belmarsh jail and will this morning learn how long he must serve behind bars.

      "bodyText": "Unrest among South Africa's platinum miners is spreading, after strikes at a Lonmin mine last week erupted into violence leaving 44 dead. About 500 workers at the nearby Royal Bafokeng platinum mine downed tools on Wednesday and blocked fellow miners from going to work. Anglo American Platinum, which is 80%-owned by London-listed Anglo American, has also received a list of demands from a group of workers in South Africa, but the company insisted they were not threatening strike action. Managers from Lonmin met workers' representatives on Tuesday night for the first time since 34 Marikana mine strikers were shot by police. Ten other people, including two police officers, died in violence earlier last week. The 3,000 striking rock drillers are demanding that their wages be trebled from 4,000 rand (\u00a3304) a month to 12,500 rand a month, and want the release of the 259 people arrested after the police crackdown last Thursday. Anglican Bishop Johannes Seoka, who was chairing the talks on Tuesday, told AFP: \"All we ask management is to please allow workers to give them their demands, to listen to them and to engage with them because the workers have been asking just to talk.

South African president Jacob Zuma has entered the debate, telling workers on Wednesday that he would speak to Lonmin about their wage demands. The Lonmin workers' demands have been echoed by rock drillers at Royal Bafokeng, who have halted work at the nearby Rasimone platinum mine. The company said it was \"making every effort to understand the reasons for and to resolve this action\". Anglo American Platinum played down the demands it has received from workers, saying it was \"a fairly regular occurrence\". A spokesman said: \"This was not a union demand or request, this was a group of workers who made a direct request to the mine's management.\" But commentators suggest this is a major problem facing the mining industry.

Donations were received from Polly Peck companies more than 22 years ago; these were accepted in good faith from what was then considered to be a leading British company,\" the spokesman said.</p> <p>An Old Bailey jury on Wednesday convicted the tycoon Nadir, 71, of 10 thefts from the former conglomerate totalling \u00a329m. He was cleared of three charges.</p> <p>Polly Peck International, once a large UK company, collapsed in 1990 after a Serious Fraud Office investigation.</p> <p>Via his companies, Nadir is thought to have been one of the Conservative party's biggest benefactors under Margaret Thatcher, a period in which party donations did not have to be publicly declared.</p> <p>Accountants investigating Polly Peck found that a subsidiary had made a series of donations to the Conservative party between 1985 and 1990, seemingly without the knowledge of the company's board or shareholders.</p> <p>Touche Ross, the administrators of Polly Peck, wrote a letter \u2013 widely reported four years ago \u2013 to the party's central office claiming that \u00a3365,000 came from money defrauded from the Polly Peck empire.</p> <p>\"It is the contention of the administrator that Mr Nadir is liable to repay the sums concerned as a result of his fraud and/or breach of fiduciary duty and/or malfeasance as a director,\" the letter concluded. \"I would urge you to return the donations to Polly Peck so that the creditors can at least obtain some small measure of compensation from this unfortunate affair.\"</p> <p>The nine donations \u2013 three from Polly Peck International, of \u00a325,000 each, and six from a subsidiary, Unipac Packaging Ltd, of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a380,000 \u2013 were paid into the Conservative Industrial Fund, according to reports, and spanned the period from October 1985 to March 1990.</p> <p>An investigation into the affair by parliament in 1993 led to Fowler (now Lord Fowler) telling the home affairs select committee that the money would be returned should it emerge it had been stolen from shareholders.</p> <p>Fowler said: \"If it is proved that that money was stolen, then clearly that money will be returned.

      "bodyText": "The Tories are coming under increasing pressure to return \u00a3440,000 in donations from the company owned by the fraudster Asil Nadir, following his conviction for stealing tens of millions of pounds. Party officials appeared to reject the demands on Wednesday when they said the donations had been received \"in good faith\" from the firm Polly Peck and that officials would study the court's judgment before deciding how to proceed. The tone of the Conservatives' statement was in marked contrast to a promise given in 1993 by Sir Norman Fowler, then party chairman, who said that the money would clearly be returned if it was proved it had been stolen. On Wednesday, a Conservative spokesperson said the party would study the court's judgment but declined to confirm that they would repay the cash if it was stolen property. \"The Conservative party has no record of having received donations from Asil Nadir. Donations were received from Polly Peck companies more than 22 years ago; these were accepted in good faith from what was then considered to be a leading British company,\" the spokesman said. An Old Bailey jury on Wednesday convicted the tycoon Nadir, 71, of 10 thefts from the former conglomerate totalling \u00a329m. He was cleared of three charges. Polly Peck International, once a large UK company, collapsed in 1990 after a Serious Fraud Office investigation. Via his companies, Nadir is thought to have been one of the Conservative party's biggest benefactors under Margaret Thatcher, a period in which party donations did not have to be publicly declared. Accountants investigating Polly Peck found that a subsidiary had made a series of donations to the Conservative party between 1985 and 1990, seemingly without the knowledge of the company's board or shareholders. Touche Ross, the administrators of Polly Peck, wrote a letter \u2013 widely reported four years ago \u2013 to the party's central office claiming that \u00a3365,000 came from money defrauded from the Polly Peck empire. \"It is the contention of the administrator that Mr Nadir is liable to repay the sums concerned as a result of his fraud and/or breach of fiduciary duty and/or malfeasance as a director,\" the letter concluded. \"I would urge you to return the donations to Polly Peck so that the creditors can at least obtain some small measure of compensation from this unfortunate affair.\" The nine donations \u2013 three from Polly Peck International, of \u00a325,000 each, and six from a subsidiary, Unipac Packaging Ltd, of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a380,000 \u2013 were paid into the Conservative Industrial Fund, according to reports, and spanned the period from October 1985 to March 1990. An investigation into the affair by parliament in 1993 led to Fowler (now Lord Fowler) telling the home affairs select committee that the money would be returned should it emerge it had been stolen from shareholders. Fowler said: \"If it is proved that that money was stolen, then clearly that money will be returned. We have absolutely no intention of keeping money of that kind.\" But he added it would be for lawyers to decide whether the money had been stolen. He defended the acceptance of the money, pointing out that Polly Peck had been a reputable company in the late 1980s and it was not possible to check the bona fides of each donor. It also emerged during the select committee inquiry that the sums did not appear in the company's accounts. Sir John Major, prime minister at the time, had echoed Fowler's comments. \"If it proves to have been dishonestly obtained and dishonestly remitted to us then of course we will return it,\" he told parliament. The close relationship between the government of Thatcher and Nadir ended in the autumn of 1990. She was ousted from No 10 and Nadir was being chased by police, creditors and irate investors. Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, was forced to resign from Major's government after it was discovered that he had given Nadir a watch inscribed \"Don't let the buggers get you down\" just before the latter fled prior to his trial in 1993. The Conservative party's latest statement echoes comments made by Liberal Democrats after a court ruled that a \u00a32.4m donation received from the convicted fraudster Michael Brown had been stolen. After Brown was returned to a British jail in April, Nick Clegg told the BBC that the party would not be returning the cash or be seeking to compensate Brown's many victims. Clegg said: \"The money was received in good faith and all the controls, all the checks that should have been made were reasonably made by the Liberal Democrats at the time.\" The Tories have, until now, gleefully taunted the Liberal Democrats over their decision to keep stolen money. Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, said the Tories had to honour the promises of Fowler and Major. \"Even John Major's government, which was mired in sleaze, knew they'd have to give back Asil Nadir's money if he was found guilty. \"David Cameron must honour the unequivocal promises the Conservatives have made to repay the \u00a3440,000 they accepted from Nadir. If he doesn't, it will show the Tory party aren't serious when they claim they want to clean up politics.\"",

      "bodyText": "A senior member of the Bank of England has warned Berlin to be lenient with indebted eurozone countries or risk the breakup of the currency union. Adam Posen, who steps down as a member of the bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) later this month, said Germany's government and banks were culpable in lending to Greece, Spain and Portugal and should recognise that the debt crisis was as much a result of poor decision-making in Frankfurt and Berlin as Athens, Madrid and Lisbon. He said the Germans would be shooting themselves in the foot if they imposed politically destabilising austerity on Greece and other struggling countries. \"It is in Germany's commercial and economic interests, not just its foreign policy and idealistic interests, to restructure the debt that other countries owe them,\" he said. In a swipe at Angela Merkel's handling of the crisis, he argued that the German chancellor should tell the truth about the culpability of successive German governments and the negative impact from a breakup. Posen, a US economist, also called for the Bank of England to take extra measures to ease credit conditions in the UK and encourage lending. He told the BBC Hardtalk programme that the double-dip recession was \"entirely predictable\" after the coalition accelerated the austerity measures adopted by the previous Labour administration. He repeated his condemnation of the Bank's governor, Sir Mervyn King, for giving public support to the policy change, though he praised him for reacting quickly to deteriorating economic conditions, especially after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the US, which precipitated the banking crisis in 2008. Posen is renowned for favouring interventionist policies to support economic growth. He lobbied for an increase in the Bank's quantitative easing policy, which he said had been under-used in 2010 and 2011. He argued that an earlier expansion of QE, which involves creating money to encourage bank lending, alongside more direct efforts to promote lending to small and medium-sized businesses, would have increased consumer demand, investment and economic growth. In a sweeping criticism of the limited measures taken by the Bank of England, he said it should buy up mortgages and the debts of non-banking lenders to free up the financial system of overwhelming debts burdens. Too often the MPC had focused on persuading high street banks to lend more rather than considering setting up new banks with a mandate to lend, said Posen. \"We should be buying things other than just gilts, such as bundles of private sector debt and special bonds to finance infrastructure. \"The funding for lending scheme set up by the Bank is a step in the right direction but I think the central bank should do more to go around the existing banking system.\"",

A debtor's negotiating strategy is to make creditors believe that a collapse would produce some much bigger catastrophe, which can be only be avoided by more concessions and more support. That sense is always more likely when the debtor's action comes without warning \u2013 the financial equivalent of a pre-dawn attack. For now the eurozone leaders' Brussels summit at the end of June looks like the most far-reaching and satisfactory attempt of recent times at European diplomacy. It might look very different in September.

Negotiations began soon after the breakup of the Soviet Union and the demise of communism and have been rumbling on \u2013 with many setbacks \u2013 for the past 19 years. The accession means that the last major economic power has joined the global trading system. Russia was the only member of the G8 group not be in the WTO and the Kremlin will be hoping entry will provide the sort of boost enjoyed by China after it was admitted to the club in 2001. That looks unlikely for three reasons. The economic climate is much frostier than it was in 2001, when the global economy was about to embark on its strongest period of growth since the late 1960s and early 1970s. China's economy was much better equipped to reap the benefits of WTO membership, with a strong manufacturing base contrasting with Russia's over-reliance on oil and gas. Finally, just as it proved impossible for other EU countries to replicate Ireland's Celtic Tiger period, so China gained from being the first former communist giant to join the WTO. There are, of course, still potential benefits to Russia from WTO membership. Moscow is hoping for a surge in foreign direct investment that will help make Russian industry more efficient. Russia's exporters will gain to the tune of $1.5bn to $2bn (\u00a3950m to \u00a31.3bn) a year from the dismantling of foreign barriers.

The Kremlin has sought to make the transition less painful by negotiating a phased-in opening up of markets. The WTO has agreed to this, in part because the Geneva-based body needs the accession of Russia to show that it is still functioning despite the stalling of the Doha round of trade liberalisation talks. But it does mean \u2013 given Russia's reputation for being a difficult place to do business \u2013 that foreign firms are likely to take a cautious approach to new investment.

      "body": "<p>Worker unrest in South Africa's mines continues to cause ripples through the financial markets this morning. Platinum surged to its highest since early May, on fears over supply as more workers strike for better pay.</p> <p>A strike at a Lonmin mine erupted into violence last week, leaving 34 people dead after clashes between police and unions. The 3,000 striking rock drillers were demanding their wages be trebled from 4,000 rand (\u00a3306) a month to 12,500 rand a month. In comparison, Lonmin's chief executive Ian Farmer, who is currently seriously ill in hospital, collected pay and bonuses of \u00a31.2m last year.</p> <p>The company has since been forced to go cap in hand to its banks after admitting that it will breach its loan agreements as a result of a strike. The shares are down another 1.4% at 604p this morning, as traders wait to see the outcome of its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/21/south-africa-warns-lonmin-strike?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">negotiations with lenders</a>.</p> <p>Now worker unrest appears to be spreading. The world's largest producer, Anglo American Platinum, said it had received a wage demand from its miners. Its parent company, Anglo American, dropped 2.5% this morning to \u00a319.33. Reuters reports that miners at Johannesburg-listed Royal Bafokeng Platinum were also blocked from going to work by colleagues.</p> <p>Platinum rose by 1.5% this morning to hit a high of $1,524.49 an ounce.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the mining sector, JP Morgan Cazenove put out a round-up of the miners, where it named Rio Tinto as its top pick in the sector.

      "bodyText": "Worker unrest in South Africa's mines continues to cause ripples through the financial markets this morning. Platinum surged to its highest since early May, on fears over supply as more workers strike for better pay. A strike at a Lonmin mine erupted into violence last week, leaving 34 people dead after clashes between police and unions. The 3,000 striking rock drillers were demanding their wages be trebled from 4,000 rand (\u00a3306) a month to 12,500 rand a month. In comparison, Lonmin's chief executive Ian Farmer, who is currently seriously ill in hospital, collected pay and bonuses of \u00a31.2m last year. The company has since been forced to go cap in hand to its banks after admitting that it will breach its loan agreements as a result of a strike. The shares are down another 1.4% at 604p this morning, as traders wait to see the outcome of its negotiations with lenders. Now worker unrest appears to be spreading. The world's largest producer, Anglo American Platinum, said it had received a wage demand from its miners. Its parent company, Anglo American, dropped 2.5% this morning to \u00a319.33. Reuters reports that miners at Johannesburg-listed Royal Bafokeng Platinum were also blocked from going to work by colleagues. Platinum rose by 1.5% this morning to hit a high of $1,524.49 an ounce. Elsewhere in the mining sector, JP Morgan Cazenove put out a round-up of the miners, where it named Rio Tinto as its top pick in the sector. The analysts wrote: Some sections of the market have expressed concern over Rio's continued project approvals at a time when the rest of the peer group have, in general, been moving in the opposite direction, deferring or cancelling projects.
