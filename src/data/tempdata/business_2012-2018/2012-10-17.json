      "bodyText": "Bumi, the mining investment vehicle founded by Nat Rothschild, has widened its internal investigation into alleged financial impropriety to include possible email hacking and the origin of a whistleblower's report that first revealed the crisis at the FTSE-250 firm. The board has asked its lawyers Macfarlanes to examine allegations of email snooping as part of its brief to investigate claims made in a dossier sent to a non-executive director last month \u2013 which plunged the company into crisis and resulted in Rothschild's resignation from the board. One source close to the board said: \"You've seen the allegations [made by Rothschild's estranged Indonesian partners, the Bakrie family] that certain email systems have been hacked \u2026 [the whistleblower's report is also] part of what the investigation is about in terms of the provenance of this information, whether it's accurate and indeed whether it's legal.

Tan invested about $1bn (\u00a3620m) buying half the Bakrie family's Bumi stake last October, despite learning during due diligence of the some of the issues now being investigated by McFarlanes. A Bumi spokesman declined to respond to why its chairman had not launched an investigation before now.

Figures show that across the UK embattled retailers closed 32 stores a day in July and August as Britain's high street continued to suffer from the consumer spending slump. That figure is up from 20 a day in the first six months of 2012. High-profile administrations this year of major retailers including Game Group, Peacocks, Past Times and Clinton Cards helped push the number of closures of town centre chain store outlets to 953 in the first half on a net basis (meaning those closing minus those opening). That compared with 174 in the whole of 2011, according to the study of 500 town centres by the retail data provider Local Data Company (LDC). for PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). The figures will spark more concern among campaigners and politicians that Britain's high streets are being abandoned by the retail chains, leading to long-term damage as stores are boarded up and shoppers head to out-of-town centres. After David Cameron appointed the television presenter Mary Portas to come up with solutions to reverse the decline, she made 28 recommendations, including setting up \"town teams\" to strengthen the running of high streets.

    "webTitle": "Energy companies to be compelled to offer lowest tariff to customers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David Cameron has been warned he will kill off competition in the energy market after he announced that companies will be forced to give all their customers the lowest tariff available. To the surprise of some of his own officials and amid consternation in Whitehall, the PM told MPs the government would introduce legislation to compel companies to offer the lowest tariff. Cameron said: \"We have encouraged people to switch, which is one of the best ways to get energy bills down. I can announce that we will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers \u2013 something that Labour did not do in 13 years, even though the leader of the Labour party could have done it because he had the job.\" The unequivocal pledge by the PM on the forthcoming energy bill caused some surprise in the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc). One source said: \"We are looking at lots of ideas about how to use the law to get the lowest tariffs. We are exploring all the options.\" One price comparison website warned that legislation could work against consumers' interests by killing competition. Ann Robinson of uSwitch.com, said: \"This has to be a mistake \u2013 the unintended consequences would be to kill competition. Consumers will be left with Hobson's choice \u2013 there will be no spur, no choice, no innovation and no reason for consumers to engage any more. The only glimmer of hope would be that smaller suppliers will be able to offer cheaper prices than the big six and therefore competition is able to continue in that arena.\" Cameron made his announcement in response to mounting concerns over rising household energy bills \u2013 four of the UK's big six energy firms have already announced above-inflation winter price hikes. After the announcement, a spokesman for the PM said: \"We've asked energy companies to take action themselves and make clear what the lowest available deals are. The point is, in practice this market is not operating for everyone. A small minority of people are actually switching deals, therefore we need to push some of this responsibility on to the energy companies.\" He said customers would have to wait until the bill was published, possibly in the autumn, for details of how the change would work in practice. The move did not mean energy companies would offer only one tariff, as different customers would need different rates. \"At the moment, the way the market works, people are encouraged to switch but many people don't \u2026 so lots of people are not benefiting from that market, particularly vulnerable people who are less likely to switch deals.\" The announcement followed a strongly-worded open letter to Cameron from consumer rights group Which?, calling for an independent review into energy bills. In the letter, the group's executive director Richard Lloyd wrote: \"It's time to face facts: the energy market is broken. The sector is dominated by a handful of big and powerful players who are seemingly unaffected by the normal competitive pressure of price and customer service.\" Reacting to Cameron's announcement, Lloyd said: \"Legislating so energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers is a big statement from the prime minister and acknowledges that competition in the energy retail market has failed. This is a big moment for consumers, but we must now see these words turned into action and see the detail from the government in the energy bill.\" Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, the trade association for the gas and electricity sector, said: \"Rebuilding trust with customers is a priority. Britain may have the cheapest gas and fourth-cheapest electricity prices in western Europe, but wholesale energy prices have been rising and now only represent half of a standard energy bill.\" Regulator Ofgem has already announced that it is looking into predatory pricing and tariff simplicity as part of its retail market review, while the government has encouraged consumers to shop around to make sure they are on the best available deals: the Decc has backed collective purchasing schemes such as the controversial Which? Big Switch initiative. On Monday SSE increased gas and electricity prices by 9%, with more price rises coming in November from other suppliers. British Gas has announced price increases of 6% in both gas and electricity; npower will raise the cost of gas by 8.8% and electricity by 9.1%; while Scottish Power's prices will rise in December by an average of 7%. The effect on household bills has spurred consumer advice groups into action. The National Right to Fuel Campaign warned that the UK was facing \"an energy bill crisis\", with cold and poorly lit homes posing \"a serious health risk to people of all ages\". Citizens Advice is launching the Big Energy Saving Week on 22 October to target millions of families across the UK with advice on keeping energy bills down. The campaign coincides with a warning from price comparison site energyhelpline.com that the best fixed rate energy deals \u2013 including deals from Ovo Energy and First Utility \u2013 are \"disappearing fast\". The government will outline plans on Thursday for a new \u00a3160m gas market infrastructure. The government will \"remove an ambiguity\" in the Gas Act to make it easier for Ofgem to launch an innovation competition that could attract \u00a3160m of extra investment. The Electricity Act will also be amended so developers will only need to undertake a three-month consultation if they want to change plans to incorporate the most energy-efficient measures. In the final announcement the energy secretary, Ed Davey, will say that reforms in the energy bill will unlock \u00a3110bn of new investment in the electricity market. \u2022 See if you can save money on your bills with the Guardian's switching service",

      "body": "<p>David Cameron has been warned he will kill off competition in the energy market after he announced that companies will be forced to give all their customers the lowest tariff available.</p> <p>To the surprise of some of his own officials and amid consternation in Whitehall, the PM told MPs the government would introduce legislation to compel companies to offer the lowest tariff.</p> <p>Cameron said: \"We have encouraged people to switch, which is one of the best ways to get energy bills down. I can announce that we will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers \u2013 something that Labour did not do in 13 years, even though the leader of the Labour party could have done it because he had the job.\"</p> <p>The unequivocal pledge by the PM on the forthcoming energy bill caused some surprise in the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc). One source said: \"We are looking at lots of ideas about how to use the law to get the lowest tariffs. We are exploring all the options.\"</p> <p>One price comparison website warned that legislation could work against consumers' interests by killing competition. Ann Robinson of <a href=\"http://www.uswitch.com/?gclid=CILMgd_diLMCFe7MtAody0IA_g\" title=\"\">uSwitch.com</a>, said: \"This has to be a mistake \u2013 the unintended consequences would be to kill competition. Consumers will be left with Hobson's choice \u2013 there will be no spur, no choice, no innovation and no reason for consumers to engage any more. The only glimmer of hope would be that smaller suppliers will be able to offer cheaper prices than the big six and therefore competition is able to continue in that arena.\"</p> <p>Cameron made his announcement in response to mounting concerns over rising household energy bills \u2013 four of the UK's big six energy firms have already announced above-inflation winter price hikes.</p> <p>After the announcement, a spokesman for the PM said: \"We've asked energy companies to take action themselves and make clear what the lowest available deals are. The point is, in practice this market is not operating for everyone. A small minority of people are actually switching deals, therefore we need to push some of this responsibility on to the energy companies.\"</p> <p>He said customers would have to wait until the bill was published, possibly in the autumn, for details of how the change would work in practice. The move did not mean energy companies would offer only one tariff, as different customers would need different rates. \"At the moment, the way the market works, people are encouraged to switch but many people don't \u2026 so lots of people are not benefiting from that market, particularly vulnerable people who are less likely to switch deals.\"</p> <p>The announcement followed a strongly-worded open letter to Cameron from consumer rights group Which?, calling for an independent review into energy bills.</p> <p>In the letter, the group's executive director Richard Lloyd wrote: \"It's time to face facts: the energy market is broken. The sector is dominated by a handful of big and powerful players who are seemingly unaffected by the normal competitive pressure of price and customer service.\"</p> <p>Reacting to Cameron's announcement, Lloyd said: \"Legislating so energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers is a big statement from the prime minister and acknowledges that competition in the energy retail market has failed. This is a big moment for consumers, but we must now see these words turned into action and see the detail from the government in the energy bill.\"</p> <p>Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, the trade association for the gas and electricity sector, said: \"Rebuilding trust with customers is a priority. Britain may have the cheapest gas and fourth-cheapest electricity prices in western Europe, but wholesale energy prices have been rising and now only represent half of a standard energy bill.\"</p> <p>Regulator Ofgem has already announced that it is looking into predatory pricing and tariff simplicity as part of its retail market review, while the government has encouraged consumers to shop around to make sure they are on the best available deals: the Decc has backed collective purchasing schemes such as the controversial Which? Big Switch initiative.</p> <p>On Monday SSE increased gas and electricity prices by 9%, with more price rises coming in November from other suppliers.</p> <p>British Gas has announced price increases of 6% in both gas and electricity; npower will raise the cost of gas by 8.8% and electricity by 9.1%; while Scottish Power's prices will rise in December by an average of 7%.</p> <p>The effect on household bills has spurred consumer advice groups into action. The National Right to Fuel Campaign warned that the UK was facing \"an energy bill crisis\", with cold and poorly lit homes posing \"a serious health risk to people of all ages\".</p> <p>Citizens Advice is launching the Big Energy Saving Week on 22 October to target millions of families across the UK with advice on keeping energy bills down.</p> <p>The campaign coincides with a warning from price comparison site <a href=\"http://www.energyhelpline.com/\" title=\"\">energyhelpline.com</a> that the best fixed rate energy deals \u2013 including deals from Ovo Energy and First Utility \u2013 are \"disappearing fast\".</p> <p>The government will outline plans on Thursday for a new \u00a3160m gas market infrastructure. The government will \"remove an ambiguity\" in the Gas Act to make it easier for Ofgem to launch an innovation competition that could attract \u00a3160m of extra investment. The Electricity Act will also be amended so developers will only need to undertake a three-month consultation if they want to change plans to incorporate the most energy-efficient measures.</p> <p>In the final announcement the energy secretary, Ed Davey, will say that reforms in the energy bill will unlock \u00a3110bn of new investment in the electricity market.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardianenergycomparison.co.uk/guardian_editorial\">See if you can save money on your bills with the Guardian's switching service</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Kremlin is poised to take control of BP's troubled Siberian oil joint venture as the boss of Russia's state-controlled oil company Rosneft flew to London to clinch the deal. BP's partners in the TNK-BP joint venture \u2013 billionaires Mikhail Fridman, German Khan, Viktor Vekselberg and Len Blavatnik \u2013 have also agreed to sell their 50% stake to Rosneft for about $28bn (\u00a317bn). At the same time BP is expected to agree a deal this week that will see the British oil giant take a 10-15% stake in Rosneft plus cash in exchange for its half of TNK-BP. Spokesmen for BP, Rosneft and AAR \u2013 the consortium of billionaires \u2013 declined to comment. If the deals go ahead Rosneft will become by far the world's biggest publicly traded oil company, producing 4.5m barrels of oil a day. It will also bring an end to BP's troublesome relationship with the billionaires, which forced Bob Dudley, BP's chief executive, to resign as head of the venture and flee Russia during a bitter row in 2008. Igor Sechin, Rosneft's chief executive and a former deputy prime minister of Russia and close associate of President Putin, flew to London on Wednesday, sources said, to seal the deal with executives in advance of BP's sale auction deadline, which expires at 9am on Thursday. Sechin's visit comes after Russia's current deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich told reporters in Moscow that Rosneft had signed a deal to buy AAR's stake in TNK-BP. However, Dvorkovich cautioned that agreement will require government approval. Rosneft could pull out of the deal to buy AAR's stake while snapping up BP's.

That's the way his fans will tell the tale if, in the next week or so, BP receives and accepts a cash-plus-shares offer from Rosneft for its 50% stake in TNK-BP. The deal would be hyped as terrific for BP for several reasons. It would end the troublesome alliance at TNK-BP with the oligarchs of AAR. And BP's future in Russia would be secure since the share-based element of the sale would equate to a stake of 10% or so in Rosneft, a platform from which to strike exploration alliances with the country's state-backed oil champion. If that's the way the plot goes, the likely losers are the oligarchs. Separately, AAR has agreed in principle to sell its own 50% stake in TNK-BP to Rosneft for $28bn. But, crucially, the billionaires don't have a firm deal \u2013 they have merely given Rosneft something closer to an option to buy. If Rosneft bags BP's stake first, AAR may find that that option is left to expire. The oligarchs would then find themselves in a 50/50 partnership with Rosneft, aka the Kremlin, the very position they wished to avoid. Their problem seems to have been a lack of ready funds to bid for BP's stake and thus take 100% control of TNK-BP themselves. Raising a few tens of billions of dollars in a hurry is not easy, especially if half the possible lenders are already on the Rosneft ticket. Dudley will not shed tears of sympathy if the oligarchs find themselves with that strategic headache But the critical question he must answer is whether a tight embrace with Rosneft is really a trouble-free route to riches for BP. There are reasons to be sceptical. Rosneft shares have gone nowhere for years and BP may soon own 10% of them, as junior partner to the Kremlin, where the outcome of tomorrow's power struggles is anybody's guess. If BP shareholders wanted to own Rosneft stock, they don't need Dudley to act as their fund manager. Small strategic stakes are commonplace in the oil industry but 10% is not small. The counter-argument is that BP can inject greater management and drilling expertise into Rosneft, and thus help to create a revival. Well, we'll see. At best, it's a long-term bet and rests on the notion that BP simply has to be in Russia to retain a seat at big oil's top table. Given a clean choice, though, would BP shareholders rather bank their winnings from TNK-BP (a very successful adventure, despite the rows in recent years with the oligarchs) and wave goodbye to Russia? Many, one suspects, would. But a pure cash proposal from Rosneft does not appear to be on the table. That's a pity.",

      "bodyText": "Greece has reached an agreement on \"most of the core measures\" to secure the release of the next \u20ac31bn tranche of its bailout as Europe's leaders prepared for a crucial two-day summit. A statement from the troika of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund said it had left Athens after \"comprehensive and productive discussion\" agreeing the broad outlines of the austerity measures Greece will be forced to impose in exchange for the latest payout. Speaking in Bucharest at a meeting of right-of-centre leaders from across Europe, Greece's prime minister Antonis Samaras said: \"I'm confident we're doing everything we have to do in order to get [a deal] and get it soon, so that we can move towards a recovery.\" The details are expected to be finalised next week and any new commitments Samaras makes will be scrutinised by the electorate, which voted him into power earlier this year on the promise of exacting more lenient conditions from the troika. Greece has seen violent protests against the stringent spending cuts and structural reforms imposed as part of previous bailout deals. Europe's financial markets had rallied on Wednesday even before the upbeat signals from Greece, after Spain dodged a widely expected downgrade to junk status from ratings agency Moody's. Spanish 10-year bond yields fell to a six-month low of 5.5% and the Ibex stock market in Madrid jumped by 1.4%, after Moody's confounded investors' expectations and left the country's rating unchanged. In London, the FTSE100 closed up 0.69% at 5910.91. Moody's said its judgment was based on the expectation that Spain would seek help from the single currency's bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. That in turn could trigger massive purchases of Spanish bonds under the ECB's plan for \"outright monetary transactions\", announced by its president, Mario Draghi, last month, helping to drive the country's borrowing costs down further. But Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has so far resisted applying for help from the eurozone, fearing that it will mean surrendering political sovereignty. Despite Wednesday's more optimistic mood, some analysts cautioned that even if a Spanish bailout does trigger the OMT, it will not bring the long-running crisis to a close. \"The OMT is a liquidity measure, it does not address solvency,\" said economists at City consultancy Fathom. \"As such, it can only buy time; it cannot solve the structural flaws behind the European debt crisis.

      "body": "<p>Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has warned the worst could still be to come for the banking sector as he called for an end to the get-rich-quick culture of the City.</p> <p>The favourite to take over from Sir Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England, Tucker told a City audience: \"There is a tangible probability \u2013 not a high probability \u2013 that the worst may still be ahead\" for banks, which was why they needed to hold more capital.</p> <p>Calling for changes to the way bonuses are paid to bankers, he stressed there was not a \"single policy initiative\" to make the system safer after the 2008 taxpayer bailout and warned that policymakers would face a backlash when they took measures to prevent exuberance in the future.</p> <p>In his first speech since formally submitting his application for the post of governor Tucker said that Threadneedle Street wanted to make it easier for new banks to be established in orderto increase competition.

      "bodyText": "Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has warned the worst could still be to come for the banking sector as he called for an end to the get-rich-quick culture of the City. The favourite to take over from Sir Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England, Tucker told a City audience: \"There is a tangible probability \u2013 not a high probability \u2013 that the worst may still be ahead\" for banks, which was why they needed to hold more capital. Calling for changes to the way bonuses are paid to bankers, he stressed there was not a \"single policy initiative\" to make the system safer after the 2008 taxpayer bailout and warned that policymakers would face a backlash when they took measures to prevent exuberance in the future. In his first speech since formally submitting his application for the post of governor Tucker said that Threadneedle Street wanted to make it easier for new banks to be established in orderto increase competition. He added: \"I would say that the Bank believes what it always believed: that sound and honest finance is not only essential for the economy, it will be good for the City too.\" He said the Financial Policy Committee, on which he sits, was concerned a \"tidal wave\" could be coming. \"We may all be grateful that there is a few billion more of capital here and there in the banking industry, keeping banks in the private sector rather than the dead hand of state ownership.\" Tucker outlined a number of reforms which were needed, and described the breakup of the Financial Services Authority into what is known as \"twin peaks\" \u2013 with the Bank getting banking supervision and the new Financial Conduct Authority looking after consumers \u2013 as \"25 years too late\". Tucker said bankers needed to be paid in subordinated debt and put more focus on customer service rather than sales and on the medium-term success of the firm. \"Putting it bluntly that would make it less easy to get rich quick irrespective of the quality of the business transacted or the compliance culture in their part of the firm,\" Tucker said, indicating this would require changes to the codes on remuneration. He said branch managers needed to no longer be seen as \"an exercise in sales and marketing\" but instead make credit judgments. While changes are under way, Tucker said that all risk could not be avoided: \"We need to find broadly the right balance between, on one hand, safety and, on the other hand, the contribution that sound and honest finance can make to economic prosperity. \"We may not be able to abolish the occasional waves of optimism that grip humanity and the tendency to excess when they set off. But we can and must dampen their effects on the financial system and economy. This must include changing the incentives that bankers face.\" He was addressing a City audience at the annual British Bankers' Association at which the FSA's managing director, Andrew Bailey, said he had made it clear to banks that the need to hold more capital should not be used as a reason to restrict lending to households and businesses. He said the government's funding for lending scheme, intended to cut the cost of borrowing, \"should improve credit creation in the economy through lowering rates on new lending \u2013 but to some degree it may also enable banks to improve their net interest margins and thus build more capital\". Bailey also praised banks for the forbearance they are offering on loans by restructuring the debts of customers in trouble. \"I think banks deserve a thank you for the way in which they have sought to use forbearance\", he said, because their action had led to \"fewer jobs .. lost and fewer homes repossessed.\" Speaking at the same conference City minister Greg Clarke compared rogue bankers who break the law by manipulating financial markets to the rioters who rampaged through UK cities last year - and said they should face similarly tough sentences, including jail. Referring to the heavy sentences handed down to many rioters, Treasury minister Greg Clark said \"a similar premium\" should apply to financial crimes that seriously damage public trust. \"Most people expect things to work in a certain way. If someone breaks the law, they should be punished. When the crime is serious, they should be locked up. This should be as true for criminals who steal through financial manipulation as it is for those who break-and-enter. \"Indeed, just as sentences handed down to those who were convicted in last year's riots reflected their contribution to the breakdown in the confidence and security enjoyed by ordinary working people, so must a similar premium apply to those crimes which destroy trust that so many people depend on.\" Meanwhile, Martin Wheatley, a senior regulator at the Financial Services Authority and boss of the soon-to-be-created Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said the payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal \"has resulted in a huge clean-up bill akin to an oil spill in terms of ongoing damage\".",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the world's most experienced financial regulators has warned the government that its planned legislation to protect the public from another banking crash is flawed. Paul Volcker, a former head of the US central bank and an adviser to president Obama, said plans to ringfence the casino investment banking arms of major banks from their high street operations would encourage bosses to seek loopholes to take bigger risks. In a submission to the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, Volcker said a ringfence was complex and difficult to regulate compared with simply splitting investment banking operations into a separate firm. \"When you adopt a ringfence, pressures from inside the organisation tends to weaken the restrictions,\" Volker said. \"I'm not saying it will be totally ineffective, but the Vickers report says it is going to have a ringfence with exceptions, and once you go down that road of having exceptions the [banking] organisation is going to push for more exceptions and widen the limits,\" he said. The warning is likely to be taken seriously by the commission, which is made up of senior MPs and Lords, including the Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie and former chancellor Lord Lawson. Tyrie has voiced concerns about the government's proposals to regulate the banking sector and about the powers of the new banking supervisor, which will be an agency of the Bank of England. The draft bank reform bill put forward by the Treasury is largely based on a report by the Independent Banking Commission, headed by Sir John Vickers. The commission rejected calls to split the banks and hive off their risky operations into separate businesses after furious lobbying by the industry. Volcker, who is 85 and came to prominence in the Reagan administration as Federal Reserve chairman, is credited with coining the so-called \"Volcker rule\", which seeks to prevent commercial banks from owning hedge fund-type operations and using their own money to take high risk bets on the markets. These hedge-fund type services, known as proprietary trading, have generated huge profits and bonuses for executives in boom times, but were in large part responsible for the financial crash of 2008. Much of Volcker's design for banking regulation has been included in the Dodd Frank Act, which the US Congress passed two years ago and which takes effect next year. He said the UK had adopted an outmoded view of banking services that categorised services designed to support business customers with the casino activities that brought about the crash. He also told the commission that the UK had chosen to ringfence the wrong parts of the bank. \"While I would leave lots of services in the core of the bank, I would separate proprietary trading into a separate firm, which can go bust if it gets the risk management wrong,\" he said. Tyrie has said his commission will examine the bill for any divergences from the Vickers report, and will consider how its recommendations will shape the incentives and behaviour of banks and bankers. Tyrie is already concerned about the drafting of the bill. He said last week: \"The draft bill appears to leave a lot of detail to be determined in secondary legislation. \"We will press vigorously to find out what that is going to contain. Only by doing so will anyone \u2013 the industry, bank customers, Parliament and the public \u2013 be able to find out what this legislation really means for them,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Two parliamentary committees are due to question tax officials about how Starbucks has been able to avoid paying tax on \u00a31.2bn of sales since 2009. MPs said that reports of a Reuters investigation showing Starbucks had been telling investors its UK business was highly profitable, while telling the authorities it was lossmaking and therefore not liable for tax, undermined public trust in the tax system. Margaret Hodge, the Labour chair of the public accounts committee, is one of several MPs who have called for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to launch an investigation into Starbucks' tax affairs. Hodge said the head of HMRC and other officials would be testifying to the committee next month and there were \"questions to answer\" about Starbucks' practices. There is no evidence that Starbucks has engaged in any kind of wrongdoing, and the company said it paid its tax in Britain to the letter of the law. Defending the company against public anger at the news of its tax bill, Starbucks' UK managing director Kris Engskov issued a lengthy post on the company's blog. In an initial version he wrote: \"The most important thing to understand is that Starbucks does pay tax in the UK. Indeed over the last three years we have paid over \u00a3160m in various taxes, including Pay As You Earn for our 8,500 UK employees, national insurance and business rates.\" The post was subsequently changed to remove the reference to PAYE, which is a tax on employees' earnings, not on businesses, but the figure of \u00a3160m remained. The company said \u00a387m of that was VAT \u2013 which is a tax on consumers. Engskov's post added: \"The truth of the matter is, the one tax that has been debated in the media, corporation tax, is based on the profits we make in this country \u2013 and regrettably we are not yet as profitable as we'd like to be.

A year later, after filing a \u00a326m loss in the UK, Starbucks' chief executive, Howard Schultz, told investors the business here was so successful he planned to apply the lessons to the company's biggest market, in the US. The chief financial officer, Troy Alstead, also called the UK business \"profitable\" in 2009 after accounts revealed a record \u00a352m loss, Reuters said. George Mudie, the chair of the Treasury subcommittee, said he also planned to question HMRC officials about Starbucks as part of their regular appearance before the committee. He said he hoped the subcommittee could hear from Starbucks executives, although he noted he would need broader subcommittee support to call the company to testify. Labour MP John Mann, a Labour MP on the subcommittee, said he would like it to hold an investigation focusing on Starbucks, but Mudie said this was unlikely. HMRC does not comment on individual taxpayers and rejected any challenge to its efficacy. \"We make sure that multinationals pay the right tax to the UK in accordance with UK tax law,\" it said in a statement. Tory MP Steve Baker also called for an inquiry. \"I am a highly free market person but what I want is simple transparent tax law that is actually obeyed \u2026 There are some serious questions to answer here,\" he said. Taxpayer confidentiality means HMRC would not be able to confirm an investigation even if it did launch one. Baker and Hodge said the government could get around this and reassure the public the matter was not being ignored by confirming in parliament that an HMRC investigation was taking place. Starbucks declined to say whether it was considering any changes to its accounting practices, but said it was \"totally committed to the UK\". \"Starbucks pays and will continue to pay our share of taxes in the UK to the letter of the law,\" said Engskov. He went on to note Starbucks' contribution to the UK economy as an employer and as a customer for farmers and cake makers.",

That, some commentators believe, is a clear signal to Italy to join Spain in seeking help from the EU to draw a line under the euro crisis.</p> <p>Here's some analysis on Blanchard's comments from our economics correspondent Phillip Inman:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The controversial IMF adviser, who recently upset Germany and the UK by announcing that austerity hurt economic growth by more than previously thought, said it was crucial to have a funding plan for both countries.</p> <p>Without a line of credit to Rome from the EU and the IMF, the fear is that Italy will face the same investor backlash as that suffered by Spain. Mario Monti is adamant Italy is in a stronger position, but what is interesting is that Blanchard disagrees.</p> <p>At the IMF's annual meetings in Tokyo last week it was obvious that European leaders were being beaten up verbally behind closed doors over their handling of the Greek/Spain bailout debacle. If Italy becomes another domino after a Spanish bailout the anger could be uncontainable (to use a word adopted by Bank of England deputy Paul Tucker in relation to another banking crisis).</p> </blockquote> <p>Monti has been keeping a rather low profile recently -- letting Mariano Rajoy 'enjoy' the spotlight instead.

      "bodyText": "Eurozone governments want Spain's borrowing costs to be reduced by using the ECB bond buying programme, rather than using the \u20ac100bn earmarked for the country's banks, according to the Wall Street Journal. Full story here (\u00a3). And on that note, it's time to close down for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow to cover the start of the two day EU summit. European markets have closed broadly higher ahead of the EU summit starting on Thursday, with increased optimism on Spain and Greece helping the positive mood. \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished up 0.69% at 5910.91 \u2022 Germany's DAX is up 0.25% \u2022 France's Cac has climbed 0.76% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is 1.56%&amp; better \u2022 Spain's Ibex is up 2.37% Spanish and Italian bond yields have both edged lower, in the wake of Moody's deciding not to downgrade Spain's credit rating after all. Still with Greece, our correspondent Helena Smith reports that while big companies (with Coco-Cola at the fore) may have given up on the debt-stricken country Hollywood hasn\u2019t. She writes: Crews, cameras, huge lorries \u2013 they are all packed into Athens\u2019 ancient Plaka district where Drive screenwriter Hossein Amiri is making his directorial debut with the movie The Two Faces of January, based on a Patricia Highsmith thriller set in the Greek capital and Crete. Turns out the Hollywood production, which stars Lord of the Rings star Viggo Mortensen and Kirsten Dunst, has been \u201ca piece of cake\u201d to film as cash-starved Greek authorities have given the Hollywood company carte blanche access to major sites \u2013 not least the once off-bounds Acropolis -- such is the desire, now, to have Greece promoted on the silver screen. \u201cThey gave us permits to the Acropolis in no time,\u201d said Panaghiotis Stellas who is part of the production team. \u201cWe spent all day on the site and were allowed to go into parts that are rarely seen.\u201d Even more surprising, says Helena, when the novel, which came out in 1964, is about three Americans who cover up the murder of a police officer in Greece. The troika of the EU, IMF and ECB have concluded their mission to Greece, and have agreed with the country most of the core measures needed on reform. Those are the snaps coming from Reuters. The troika also says discussions on the remaining issues with continue via the technical representatives in the coming days. Spain's bad bank could be widened to include not just bad property assets but also consumer loans. Reuters is reporting economy ministry sources as saying the maximum size of the bank, set up to take over toxic real estate loans, could be \u20ac90bn. But that is a maximum, and the final figure could be considerably smaller. A full break-up and demise of the euro remains unlikely but the risk of a Greek exit is material. That's the view of ratings agency Fitch in a new report on the effect of a possible eurozone exit on covered bonds. Greece is close to a deal with its lenders according to prime minister Antonis Samaras. Despite the on-off talks with the troika over its austerity budget, he said in Bucharest: I'm confident we're doing everying we have to do in order to get (a deal) and get it soon, so that we can move towards a recovery. (Report from Reuters) Finnish prime minister Jyrki Katainen seems to have come out in favour of the idea of Spain getting a precautionary credit line, rather than needing a full bailout. According to a Bloomberg report, he said In Bucharest (where a meeting of centre right parties is being held): If Spain decides to ask for some sort of bailout, then Europe should be ready to act -- and I\u2019m sure they will not need a full program like Ireland or Portugal, and instead they might need some sort of a precautionary program. The main focus now should be that Spain remains in the market and gets funding. Our Europe editor Ian Traynor has analysed the criticisms of German chancellor Angela Merkel by France's new president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande (see earlier) ahead of the start of the EU summit. His conclusion: Hollande's position is both strong and weak. There is the inherent strength of being a newly elected president of France. But he oversees a sclerotic economy that every month is forfeiting its competitiveness and widening the performance gap with Germany following years of failure by all French leaders to reform. If he can tackle these taboos and turn that record around, he will be in a much stronger position vis-\u00e0-vis Berlin. But his appeal and his warning demonstrate he is not backing down in the argument with Germany about how to make Europe fit for the future. He is also looking for a new deal with Merkel. Without that compromise, Europe's worst ever crisis will get worse yet. The full piece is here. Elsewhere in realm of Euro-bailout-land, Cyprus expects final negotiations about financial aid to start next week. Finance minister Vassos Shiarly told reporters a figure had not been set for how much the country needed because of a difference of opinion between the government and its lenders, Reuters reported. (This sounds familiar). There has been speculation Cyprus might need more than \u20ac10bn and Shiarly said talks with the troika would start before the end of the month: Within the month and certainly in the coming week. Time is restricted and there is not much time left. The country has also been in contact with the Russians about possible financial aid, according to a number of recent reports. News website zerohedge has a nice line on the current state of Spain. Back in Greece, striking doctors, lawyers and state researchers have been protesting en masse over the latest EU-IMF mandated austerity measures. Prominent Athenian attorney Yiannis Vlachos told our correspondent Helena Smith that the projected cuts condemn Greek lawyers to unemployment and will ultimately cut off the ability of ordinary Greeks to have recourse to justice. They are totally unfair and it is our democratic right to oppose them which we will do. Would your finances get you kicked out of the Eurozone? We've launched a online quiz today, ahead of tomorrow's EU summit, that lets you measure your financial strength (or otherwise). It's rather jolly. For the record, I came out as Finland. Over at the FT, though, finances look a little less shaky (so I know who'll be getting the beers in next time...) I'm heading off now (next stop, the back row of the auditorium for this year's Wincott Lecture), so my colleague Nick Fletcher will see us home. Thanks. GW Andrew Tyrie MP has called the eurozone crisis the \"elephant in the room\" and one of the reasons that banks are having difficulty restoring their balance sheets (my colleague Jill Treanor reports) The conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee told the British Bankers Association today that he had been busy reading the IMF world economic outlook and decided it was very gloomy. Jill adds: And even more gloomily, Willem Buiter of Citigroup has declared that there is \"no capital (banks) can hold\" against a total break up of the eurozone. Not much to cheer about then. Back to Athens, where our Helena Smith has found an interesting nugget about Greece's bailout payments in the latest document released by the Athens government. In an informal document produced late on Tuesday, the finance ministry insisted that it expected the country to receive its next installment of bailout funds \u2013 at \u20ac31.5bn crucial to recapitalizing banks and vitalizing the liquidity-starved Greek economy -- by next month. She writes: \u201cWe expect the entire installment sometime around the middle of November. The [troika\u2019s] debt sustainability report is expected before the American elections. There are ways to ensure sustainability. The most important parameter is the suppositions we make about the Greek economy\u2019s development,\u201d declared the document which said a compromise solution had even been found over the controversial issue of predicting what next year\u2019s recession would be with both sides settling on 4.2 %. \"It is for the finance ministry to see to it that the next installment comes to Greece. That means that by definition we have the first say in these negotiations.\u201d But despite the insistence that the breakdown in talks earlier on Tuesday has now been repaired, there are few who are convinced, Helena adds. Many MPs in the three parties backing the conservative-led coalition have said, openly, that they will not endorse recession-inducing measures that will take Greece back decades when they eventually are put to parliament for a vote. The main opposition Syriza party blasted Antonis Samaras\u2019 fragile coalition for of simply going through the motions of negotiating austerity measures that will \u201cannihilate the Greek people\", adding: Greek society has yet again today watched another theatrical performance given in particularly dramatic tones. IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard's comments to Italian paper Il Corriere della Sera (see 9.30am) are being taken as a signal that the Fund wants Italy to seek financial help. As I mentioned earlier, Blanchard argued that it was essential to devise \"a plan for the two countries of the periphery\". That, some commentators believe, is a clear signal to Italy to join Spain in seeking help from the EU to draw a line under the euro crisis. Here's some analysis on Blanchard's comments from our economics correspondent Phillip Inman: The controversial IMF adviser, who recently upset Germany and the UK by announcing that austerity hurt economic growth by more than previously thought, said it was crucial to have a funding plan for both countries. Without a line of credit to Rome from the EU and the IMF, the fear is that Italy will face the same investor backlash as that suffered by Spain. Mario Monti is adamant Italy is in a stronger position, but what is interesting is that Blanchard disagrees. At the IMF's annual meetings in Tokyo last week it was obvious that European leaders were being beaten up verbally behind closed doors over their handling of the Greek/Spain bailout debacle. If Italy becomes another domino after a Spanish bailout the anger could be uncontainable (to use a word adopted by Bank of England deputy Paul Tucker in relation to another banking crisis). Monti has been keeping a rather low profile recently -- letting Mariano Rajoy 'enjoy' the spotlight instead. But if Spain does seek help, attention may switch back to Italy. It's three years this week since the eurozone crisis began. On 19 October 2009, the new Greek government admitted that it had discovered a black hole in Greece's finances and that its deficit would be twice as big as feared. That was the first rumblings of serious trouble in the eurozone. Since then we have seen three bailouts, umpteen politicians driven from office, public protests, stock market plunges (and rallies), nail-biting deadlines, dramatic (and occasionally turgid) Summits. And we're only 36 months in. My colleagues Nick Mead and Garry Blight have built a frankly awesome interactive timeline that lets you relive the drama -- Eurozone crisis: three years of pain. [CLICK HERE] And don't just take my word for it: As was rumoured yesterday, the German government has lowered its forecast for economic growth in 2013 to 1% of GDP, from 1.6% previously. Despite the downgrade, the Berlin government is still bullish \u2013 blaming the downgrade on the eurozone crisis and weakness in emerging markets. Economy Minister Philipp R\u00f6sler said: Germany is navigating stormy waters because of the European sovereign debt crisis and an economic weakening in emerging nations in Asia and Latin America. And added: We are still talking about 1% growth [for 2013], so there's no talk about a crisis for Germany. A solid defense from R\u00f6sler there -- something the German football team would have benefitted from last night.... The graph above shows how both Spanish and Italian sovereign debt has recovered since the wild days of July. Both country's 10-year bond yields have now dropped to their lowest level since this spring. Another positive signal for Spain: the cost of insuring its debt has dropped sharply today to the lowest point since July 2011. Markit reported that the cost of a five-year Spanish credit default swap fell 39 basis points to 283bp. Over to Greece where our correspondent Helena Smith has the latest on the on-off talks over the bumper, \u20ac13.5bn package of budget cuts and structural reforms that are key to the euro zone\u2019s weakest link receiving further rescue funds. Helena writes: After yet another round of marathon talks, the Greek finance minister Yiannis Stournaras emerged well after midnight Tuesday to douse speculation (fueled earlier in the day by labour ministry officials) that negotiations with envoys representing the country\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors were badly off-track. In pointed remarks clearly aimed at inter-governmental critics, the Oxford-trained economist said the finance ministry was in charge of negotiations with the EU, ECB and IMF. Stournaras said: \u201cThe finance ministry, which is the guardian of the economy\u2019s stability, is not going to stop suggesting compromise solutions to all the problems that arise, even those that concern other ministries. I remain optimistic that things will develop well. The \u201copen issues\u201d that remained would be resolved in the coming days following an initiative by prime minister Antonis Samaras to personally tackle the thorny issue of labour market reforms: In the coming days Yiannis Vroutsis [the labour minister] will propose solutions to the issues that have come up. Finance ministry officials said further negotiations would be conducted via email with the troika whose mission chiefs leave Athens today. \u201cThey may well return although it may not be required,\u201d the officials said. HS The euro continues to rally on the back of Moody's decision not to downgrade Spain - it just hit a new one-month high of \u20ac1.313. Portugal held a pretty successful auction of short-term debt this morning. The third European country to be bailed out since the crisis began saw a sharp fall in some yields, as its re-integration into the markets continues. Here's the details. \u2022 \u20ac1.85bn of 3, 6 and 12-month bonds sold, vs maximum target of \u20ac2bn \u2022 Three-month bond yields fell to 1.366%, vs 2.16% last time \u2022 Six-month bond yields rose to 1.839%, vs 1.7% last time \u2022 Twelve-month bond yields fell to 2.1%, vs 3.5% last time So despite the growing tension in Portugal over the government's austerity programme, its credit worthiness appears to be improving. But Nick Spiro, bond expert at Spiro Sovereign Strategy, warns that Portugal is at a \"a critical juncture\": For the time being, waning political support for the government's austerity policies is not putting upward pressure on yields. Portuguese paper is benefiting from the \"Draghi effect\" which continues to outweigh concerns about political and social stability in Portugal. However, it's clear that the consensus surrounding the need for more austerity is unravelling and poses a serious threat to the bail-out agreement. Some more interesting line out of Berlin -- Reuters' \"senior German official\" has said that Spain would have to accept conditions in return for an aid programme, and that the Troika would have to decide \"how far conditionality goes\". Said official also said he didn't expect an interim report on Greece from the Troika \u2013 hardly surprising, after talks between the two sides broke down last night. A \"senior German official\" has told Reuters that Angela Merkel and her team will seek a \"decisive step forwards\" on economic co-operation at the EU Summit which begins tomorrow. However a decision on banking union is NOT expected. And the unnamed official also defended Berlin's refusal to allow early recapitalisation of European banks through the ESM, saying that it is \"clear\" that the agreement made in June states that this cannot happen until 'effective' banking supervision is in place. This is exactly what Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is banging on about in today's interview when he urges Berlin to stop trying to reverse June's decisions. The problem is that the two sides disagree fundamentally about what was agreed almost four months ago -- Southern states thought they had a breakthrough deal that breaks the vicious link between banks and sovereign states. Germany has been trying to unpick this ever since.... French president Francois Hollande has warned that tensions between France and Germany risk destroying efforts to resolve the euro crisis. In this exclusive interview, Hollande said it was vital that Angela Merkel stopped trying to reverse the important decisions taken at the last summit in June, and accused the German chancellor of being too preoccupied with domestic politics. Ratcheting up the pressure ahead of tomorrow's Summit in Brussels, Hollande also said he would fight German attempts to create a federalised eurozone. The full piece by m'learned colleagues Angelique Chrisafis and Ian Traynor is essential reading ahead of tomorrow's Summit: Hollande fires warning shot at Merkel over austerity on eve of EU summit Good news: UK unemployment has fallen. The ILO labour force measure, released a few minutes ago, shows a 50,000 drop in the number of people out of work in the three months to August. This pushed down the jobless rate to 7.9%, from 8.1%, with 2.53m people out of work. Youth unemployment is down by 62,000 to around 957,000. The more timely claimant count also dropped, by 4,000 in September. The number of people IN work hit a record high, of 29.59m. Average pay also crept higher, up 1.7% compared to a year ago. That's an improvement, but still fails to match inflation (which came in at 2.2% yesterday). No major dissent at the Bank of England this month. Minutes of the last MPC meeting were just released, and show that the committee voted 9-0 to leave its quantitative easing programme unchanged, and to leave interest rates at 0.5%. But MPC members did disagree over whether more QE would be particularly effective. Here's the key quote: Some members felt that there was still considerable scope for asset purchases to provide further stimulus. Other members, while acknowledging that asset purchases had the scope to lower long-term yields further, questioned the magnitude of the impact that lower long-term yields on corporate debt and equity would have on the broader economy at the present juncture. The minutes are online here Olivier Blanchard, chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, has declared that the eurozone has almost put all the necessary measures in place to tackle Spain and Italy's debt problems. Almost. In an interview with Italian newspaper daily Il Corriere della Sera, Blanchard said: In the short-term it would be crucial to have a plan for the two countries of the periphery...This would include not only an ongoing process of adjustment inside the countries but also a guarantee they can fund themselves. This would be conditional on them sticking to their commitments. We are almost there but not quite at that point yet. (Quotes via Reuters) Blanchard added that the IMF would only contribute to a Spanish bailout if it was happy with the terms of the accompanying programme. But given its recent admission that austerity is more damaging than thought, might the IMF insist on less onerous conditions?.... Here's some more analyst reaction to Moody's decision not to downgrade Spain (see 7.40am onwards). Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets A nagging doubt may have been erased, but it\u2019s unlikely to mean a Spanish bailout is any nearer, hence equities halting [the FTSE 100 is now flat]. Does PM Rajoy need to ask for help? Market implied borrowing costs are already lower after ECB pledge to help, the possibility of an ESM credit line request being enough to see ECB act and now last night\u2019s Moody\u2019s news. Major resistance still ahead. Another EU summit looms. Investec: A couple of week\u2019s back Moody\u2019s said it saw potentially larger losses for Spanish banks under its stressed scenario, compared to the independent analysis underlying the capital requirements called for in September. Yesterday\u2019s statement said the negative outlook reflected that risks to the baseline scenario were high and skewed to the downside and it again warned that if the Spanish government was to lose, or very likely to lose access to private capital markets then a potential multi-notch downgrade would follow. The confirmation of Spain\u2019s rating reduces the likelihood of the average rating going in to sub-investment grade territory and the consequent elimination from IG indices. Funny to think it was triple-A rated just over 2 years ago. ---------------- And on a lighter note: Here's what's coming up in the financial world today, including two interesting releases in the UK \u2022 UK unemployment data: 9.30am BST \u2022 Minutes of the last Bank of England QE/rate-setting meeting: 9.30am BST \u2022 Eurozone construction data for August: 10am BST/11am CEST \u2022 Germany announces new economic forecasts: 11am BST/noon CEST \u2022 Portugal auctions short-term bonds: morning \u2022 New US housing data: 1.30pm BST / 8.30am EST Moody's decision to affirm Spain's credit rating has sparked a rally on the Spanish stock market, where the IBEX is up 1.5% in early trading. Much less action on other European markets, with the FTSE 100 up just 6 points, and the German DAX effectively flat. Spanish sovereign debt have strengthened dramatically this morning on the back of Moody's decision, driving down the yields* on its bonds to their lowest level in months. Italian bonds are also staging a strong recovery. The Spanish 10-year yields has dropped by a whopping 23 basis points to 5.57% - its lowest level since April, as this graph shows: * - for new readers, yields measure the rate of return on a bond, so indicate the cost of borowing Italy's 10-year bonds are down 10 basis points at 4.83%. Shorter dated bonds are also rallying. The yield on Spain's 2-year debt is down 16 basis point at 3.01%. The reaction shows just how much nervousness there's been in the financial markets over the threat of a downgrade from Moody's. Here's some early reaction to Moody's decision: A Moody's senior analyst has warned that Spain will be cut to junk status if it loses access to the financial markets and is forced into a full-scale bailout. Kathrin Muehlbronner told Reuters that: A full program along those lines where basically the official sector provides exclusively the funding for all your requirements, that in our view is not compatible with an investment grade, and that would apply in all the cases. So a precautionary credit line from the European Stability Mechanism (Spain's preferred option), would be OK - if that drove borrowing costs down and maintained Spain's access to the markets. In a nutshell - Moody's has concluded that Spain and the eurozone are doing JUST ENOUGH to ensure that Madrid can keep borrowing and financing its debts. Moody's full statement on Spain is online here: Moody's confirms Spain's government bond rating at Baa3/(P)P-3, assigns negative outlook. Here's the summary: Moody's believes that the combination of euro area and ECB support and the Spanish government's own efforts should allow the government to maintain capital market access at reasonable rates, providing it with the time it needs to stabilise public debt over the next few years. It added, though, that the threat of a debt restructuring or default will hang over Spain for years: In Moody's view, the maintenance of market access is critical because the risk that some form of burden-sharing will be imposed on bondholders is material for those countries that rely entirely or to a very large extent on official-sector funding for an extended period of time. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events in the global economy. The big news this morning is that Spain has not been downgraded to junk status. After months of deliberations, ratings agency Moody's has decided to affirm Spain at Baa3 -- the lowest 'investment grade' rating -- with a negative outlook. The decision is a rare piece of good news for Mariano Rajoy's government as it continues to inch towards a request for financial aid. Moody's said three \"positive developments\" were behind its decision.1) the European Central Bank's decision to buy unlimited bonds of a country in distress (if it signs up for an aid programme), 2) the fact Spain is pushing on with economic reforms, 3) progress on restructuring Spain's banking sector. The news has already sent the euro to a one-month high against the US dollar, above $1.31. We'll be tracking all the reaction to Moody's decision this morning. Also coming up...a Portuguese bond sale, new economic forecasts from Germany, and fresh UK unemployment data (full agenda to follow). And it's the final day before the EU Summit begins in Brussels.",

    "webTitle": "Unemployment falls to 15-month low", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hopes that Britain's economy is starting to recover from recession were boosted by a surprise fall in unemployment to its lowest rate since June 2011 while the number of people in work hit the highest level ever recorded. Unemployment on the International Labour Organisation measure fell by 50,000 to 2.5 million in the three months to August, pushing the jobless rate to 7.9% from 8.1%, according to the Office for National Statistics. City economists had expected the rate to stay stable. This compares with 10.5% in the EU \u2013 Spain had the highest unemployment rate at 25.1% in August while Austria had the lowest at 4.2%. The number of employed people in Britain rose by 212,000 to 29.6 million, the highest since records began in January 1971, although more than half of the increase was a result of part-time job creation. A survey from Legal &amp; General showed 78% of workers feel secure in their jobs this month. Jobless benefits claimants dropped by 4,000 to 1.6 million last month, confounding expectations of a flat outturn. This came after a sharp fall of 14,200 in August, which the ONS attributed partly to hiring in London for the Olympics. The Olympic organisers said the games required about 6,000 paid staff, up to 70,000 volunteers and around 100,000 contractors. \"Once again, UK data has rebutted the claim that the UK is as bad as some of the eurozone's struggling economies,\" said ING economist Rob Carnell. \"Progress was evident across a broad range of the labour report. With revised GDP data suggesting the UK returned to underlying growth in the second quarter, this labour data provides hope that this recovery has been ongoing over recent months, raising some doubt about whether the monetary policy committee will unleash a new round of asset purchases next month.\" Minutes of the MPC's last meeting a fortnight ago showed that while the committee voted unanimously to keep interest rates and the \u00a3375bn bond-buying programme unchanged, members were split over whether more economic stimulus would be needed in future. The ONS data also showed that youth unemployment improved, with the number of 16 to 24-year-olds out of work falling below a million in the three months to August, down 62,000 compared with March to May. That took the jobless rate among young people down to 20.5% from 21.8%. Wage growth finally picked up across the economy, with average earnings rising by 1.7% in the three months to August from a year earlier. Wages have failed to keep up with inflation, which was above 5% a year ago taking the gap to over 3%. The squeeze on household incomes has now eased considerably with regular pay, excluding bonuses, up 2%, inching closer to the rate of inflation at 2.2%. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, noted: \"The fall in public sector employment has slowed considerably since March while private sector employment has risen significantly. This supports our view that the economy should see a gradual recovery during the second half of this year.\" There are still some areas of concern, in particular further increases in long-term unemployment and the growth in part-time and freelance work. But the resilience of the labour market has puzzled economists, at a time when the UK economy slipped back into recession. One explanation is that companies have been able to hang on to more people by keeping wages low. Scott Corfe, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: \"UK employers may be behaving in a different way during this economic crisis compared with previous crises. Instead of shedding jobs, many employers seem to be favouring pay restraint and reduced working hours as a means of controlling costs.\"",

City economists had expected the rate to stay stable. This compares with 10.5% in the EU \u2013 Spain had the highest unemployment rate at 25.1% in August while Austria had the lowest at 4.2%.</p> <p>The number of employed people in Britain rose by 212,000 to 29.6 million, the highest since records began in January 1971, although more than half of the increase was a result of part-time job creation. A survey from Legal &amp; General showed 78% of workers feel secure in their jobs this month.</p> <p>Jobless benefits claimants dropped by 4,000 to 1.6 million last month, confounding expectations of a flat outturn. This came after a sharp fall of 14,200 in August, which the ONS attributed partly to hiring in London for the Olympics. The Olympic organisers said the games required about 6,000 paid staff, up to 70,000 volunteers and around 100,000 contractors.</p> <p>\"Once again, UK data has rebutted the claim that the UK is as bad as some of the eurozone's struggling economies,\" said ING economist Rob Carnell. \"Progress was evident across a broad range of the labour report. With revised GDP data suggesting the UK returned to underlying growth in the second quarter, this labour data provides hope that this recovery has been ongoing over recent months, raising some doubt about whether the monetary policy committee will unleash a new round of asset purchases next month.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/17/bank-england-mpc-quantitative-easing\" title=\"\">Minutes of the MPC's last meeting a fortnight ago</a> showed that while the committee voted unanimously to keep interest rates and the \u00a3375bn bond-buying programme unchanged, members were split over whether more economic stimulus would be needed in future.</p> <p>The ONS data also showed that youth unemployment improved, with the number of 16 to 24-year-olds out of work falling below a million in the three months to August, down 62,000 compared with March to May. That took the jobless rate among young people down to 20.5% from 21.8%.</p> <p>Wage growth finally picked up across the economy, with average earnings rising by 1.7% in the three months to August from a year earlier. Wages have failed to keep up with inflation, which was above 5% a year ago taking the gap to over 3%. The squeeze on household incomes has now eased considerably with regular pay, excluding bonuses, up 2%, inching closer to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/16/uk-inflation-lowest-since-november-2009\" title=\"\">the rate of inflation at 2.2%</a>.</p> <p>John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, noted: \"The fall in public sector employment has slowed considerably since March while private sector employment has risen significantly.

      "standfirst": "Unemployment is down and more people are shifting from full-time employment to freelance or self-employment", 
      "body": "<p>Ian Tonkinson, 35, is sitting in dusty overalls in the top-floor flat of a smart block in Earl's Court, London. A tray of paint and a roller compete for space on the table with a bath panel. In the living room beyond, a toilet, bathtub and sink are clustered among a jumble of tools and building materials.</p> <p>\"I have moments when I'd like to be in the office, get on the tube, be behind a desk doing my work for a while,\" he says. \"The majority of the time, it's nice being on different sites, when things are going well and everyone's happy. [Tradesmen] can be a grumpy bunch, they need a lot of hand-holding.\"</p> <p>Tonkinson (above right) was made redundant as a property manager with Foxtons estate agents five years ago. \"There was a payoff, that gave me a grace period. It was the perfect time to find out what I wanted to do.\" He swapped the branded mini for a white van and now runs a building company with a partner.</p> <p>He is one of a growing number of people shifting from full-time employment to freelance or self-employment. The Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday that 35,000 more people registered as self-employed in the three months to August, bringing the total to 4.2 million. Over the past four years the number of self-employed has risen by around 10%.</p> <p>For Tonkinson, the experience has been mixed. \"When you ask, 'is it working?', in terms of volume of work, we always have been busy. If you look at our turnover compared to profits, are we successful on numbers? Maybe not. I don't tell people things aren't going well,\" he smiles. \"I tell people I'm busy.\"</p> <p>He and his partner each take home around \u00a326,000 a year after tax, less than they pay their employees and significantly less than his Foxtons salary.</p> <p>But he enjoys working for himself and likes the fact he has people working for him. \"Not in the power trip side of things but you are providing jobs for half a dozen plus people,\" he says.</p> <p>\"That's something we're proud of. And success and failure is down to you. That has its ups and downs; you can't blame anybody else, which in this trade is rare.\"</p> <p>Some people suggest this steep increase in self-employment is the result of a trend towards so-called portfolio careers, made up of different types of work, such as consultancy, writing and training. But Charles Levy, senior economist at the Work Foundation, is sceptical: \"We would have to see good evidence for why it was changing before we believed there was a fundamental shift, rather than being a group of people clinging on to the edge of the labour market. [The figures] are dominated by lower-skilled individuals who would be equally happy with a full-time job but are in a position to be self-employed, such as cleaners, builders, taxi drivers.\"</p> <p>Employment patterns have changed dramatically since the financial crisis. As well as the growing army of self-employed, there are more and more people in part-time and temporary work. Overall the number of people employed has been growing, leaving analysts puzzled, as the economy is flat-lining. That results in a stark drop in productivity.</p> <p>Economists says this is, in part, down to a lack of demand for goods and services coupled with employers' resistance to cutting staff. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, explains: \"Bank credit is subdued. Even if there is a latent demand for a product, firms can't buy that product because they don't have the credit. In our view a lot of the productivity debate can be answered by a lack of demand.\"</p> <p>He says companies are holding onto their workforce, where they possibly can, for fear of being short of skills when the economy starts to improve. They can afford to hold onto staff by keeping pay growth down and, in some cases, insisting that employees work part-time.</p> <p>So, before the crisis, the growth of average earnings was somewhere between 4% and 4.5% a year. On Wednesday, however, the ONS figures showed average earnings rising by 1.7%, lower than the rate of inflation at 2.2%.

      "bodyText": "Ian Tonkinson, 35, is sitting in dusty overalls in the top-floor flat of a smart block in Earl's Court, London. A tray of paint and a roller compete for space on the table with a bath panel. In the living room beyond, a toilet, bathtub and sink are clustered among a jumble of tools and building materials. \"I have moments when I'd like to be in the office, get on the tube, be behind a desk doing my work for a while,\" he says. \"The majority of the time, it's nice being on different sites, when things are going well and everyone's happy. [Tradesmen] can be a grumpy bunch, they need a lot of hand-holding.\" Tonkinson (above right) was made redundant as a property manager with Foxtons estate agents five years ago. \"There was a payoff, that gave me a grace period. It was the perfect time to find out what I wanted to do.\" He swapped the branded mini for a white van and now runs a building company with a partner. He is one of a growing number of people shifting from full-time employment to freelance or self-employment. The Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday that 35,000 more people registered as self-employed in the three months to August, bringing the total to 4.2 million. Over the past four years the number of self-employed has risen by around 10%. For Tonkinson, the experience has been mixed. \"When you ask, 'is it working?', in terms of volume of work, we always have been busy. If you look at our turnover compared to profits, are we successful on numbers? Maybe not. I don't tell people things aren't going well,\" he smiles. \"I tell people I'm busy.\" He and his partner each take home around \u00a326,000 a year after tax, less than they pay their employees and significantly less than his Foxtons salary. But he enjoys working for himself and likes the fact he has people working for him. \"Not in the power trip side of things but you are providing jobs for half a dozen plus people,\" he says. \"That's something we're proud of. And success and failure is down to you. That has its ups and downs; you can't blame anybody else, which in this trade is rare.\" Some people suggest this steep increase in self-employment is the result of a trend towards so-called portfolio careers, made up of different types of work, such as consultancy, writing and training. But Charles Levy, senior economist at the Work Foundation, is sceptical: \"We would have to see good evidence for why it was changing before we believed there was a fundamental shift, rather than being a group of people clinging on to the edge of the labour market. [The figures] are dominated by lower-skilled individuals who would be equally happy with a full-time job but are in a position to be self-employed, such as cleaners, builders, taxi drivers.\" Employment patterns have changed dramatically since the financial crisis. As well as the growing army of self-employed, there are more and more people in part-time and temporary work. Overall the number of people employed has been growing, leaving analysts puzzled, as the economy is flat-lining. That results in a stark drop in productivity. Economists says this is, in part, down to a lack of demand for goods and services coupled with employers' resistance to cutting staff. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, explains: \"Bank credit is subdued. Even if there is a latent demand for a product, firms can't buy that product because they don't have the credit. In our view a lot of the productivity debate can be answered by a lack of demand.\" He says companies are holding onto their workforce, where they possibly can, for fear of being short of skills when the economy starts to improve. They can afford to hold onto staff by keeping pay growth down and, in some cases, insisting that employees work part-time. So, before the crisis, the growth of average earnings was somewhere between 4% and 4.5% a year. On Wednesday, however, the ONS figures showed average earnings rising by 1.7%, lower than the rate of inflation at 2.2%. Companies may have held onto staff despite production going down but their costs per employee are going down in real terms. But Shaw does not think effective pay cuts have caused people to work less hard. \"I'm sure it's probably the case for certain individuals but I don't think that explains trends in the economy as a whole.\" Tonkinson says that is certainly his experience with tradesmen. \"There is a split; people are either proud of their work or they just do their day. That doesn't seem to be linked to pay. There's a standard rate; you find some who care and some who don't.\"",
