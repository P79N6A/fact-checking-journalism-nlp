    "webTitle": "George Osborne's welfare cuts pander to the distortions of Benefits Street", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne could hardly have timed it better. On the day he laid out his plans to cut another \u00a310bn from Britain's welfare budget, Channel 4 launched Benefits Street, its fly-on-the-wall documentary of what life is like for families in Birmingham living on the wrong side of the tracks. Cue an almighty row. The chancellor split the cabinet just as Benefits Street split the country. Nick Clegg said it was wrong for the poorest to bear the brunt of the next phase of austerity, but Osborne is convinced his plan will be politically popular. Some members of the viewing public said Benefits Street gave such a false impression that it should be pulled. Others said the programme confirmed their opinions of people described on social media as \"low-life scum\". No question, Benefits Street paints a distorted picture. In the real world almost half the residents in such a place would be pensioners, because they are recipients of nigh-on 50% of the welfare budget. Another 20% of those followed by the TV cameras would be people in work but relying on state benefits such as family and income support and tax credits to help them make ends meet. Nor is it true that the benefits bill is spiralling out of control. The welfare budget rose steadily from the late 1940s and peaked in the 1980s. As a percentage of GDP it fell under the Labour governments of 1997 to 2010. Despite the stories of people fleecing the state the latest estimates suggest that just over \u00a31bn, or just under 1% of the budget, was lost through fraud in 2011-12. That compares to (almost certainly conservative) estimates of \u00a332bn lost in unpaid tax in the same year. Yet, in a sense, Benefits Street provides a public service. In the week when the big City investment banks announce their annual bonuses it shows that there is another Britain where people are unable to afford to spend \u00a325,000 on a personalised number plate that spells BU11 ISH, or blow the same amount on a couple of bottles of vintage claret. The programme ought to prompt a debate about why more than half the children and working-age adults in poverty today actually live in households where at least one person is working and where getting a job is not a guarantee of lifting yourself above the breadline. Sadly, that is unlikely to happen. Attitudes towards the poor have hardened markedly in the past couple of decades, with more people saying that they have only themselves to blame for their plight. This view is reflected in popular culture, and contempt for what was known as the working class. Think Little Britain's portrait of Vicky Pollard, the feckless and stupid single mother, or Andy, pretending to be disabled. It was quite a different story 40 or 50 years ago. Then many novels, films, TV shows and plays portrayed working people as ambitious, witty and self-reliant. Sure, there were programmes that highlighted poverty, but the poor were viewed with sympathy. In the 1960s film crews were crawling all over Liverpool but they were there to find out what made the Beatles tick not to unearth stories about families on benefits swinging the lead. In the words of the television series, Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? Three things really. First, working people demanded their share of a growing economy. The trade unions grew in power and influence, which alarmed employers and the political right. By the late 1970s it was thought that organised labour needed to be put back in its box. This was achieved by the combination of Margaret Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping. The Iron Lady attacked the trade unions, and Deng's modernisation programme in China helped transform a series of protected nation-state economies into a global village where capital and jobs could be easily exported. Finally, the left bought the argument that there was no real alternative to the free-market economic policies of the right. Instead of arguing that poverty could be solved by full employment, strong trade unions and rising real wages, the left decided that the role of the state was to lay on parenting classes, tackle binge drinking, crack down on smoking and change diets. The message was that the poor could stop being poor if they made the right sort of lifestyle choices. Throughout this process, stretching back 30 years and more, there has been talk of how the poor should get on their bikes and how the state can use tax credits to make work pay. It has taken the great recession to highlight the shortcomings of a model that, at its root, relies on tipping the balance of power decisively and permanently in favour of employers. Julia Unwin, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, noted in a recent short book, entitled Why Fight Poverty, that jobs are now more short-term than ever, with a rapid churn between the dole and low-paid work. The labour market has been hollowed out, with a small number of highly paid jobs, millions of badly paid jobs and little in the middle. Graduates have been employed in the relatively unskilled jobs that were once the destination for school leavers. There has been growing exploitation of workers, particularly migrant workers. Financial pressures have also increased. Housing has become more expensive and harder to get, while the cost of basic goods and services, including food, fuel, transport and insurance, has been rising faster than inflation. \"In short, we have a more or less flat-lining economy, an increasingly polarised labour market and a highly regionalised, localised housing market, combined with stagnating pay and a rapidly increasing cost of living\", Unwin said. That is the problem. Tackling it is an altogether different matter. It's simple enough for Osborne to cut non-pensioner benefits, but for the policy to work there have to be enough, decently paid, jobs for people to move into. That is not currently the case. Topping up poverty pay through tax credits was a short-term fix rather than a long-term solution, while getting the poor to eat \"five a day\" [fruit and vegetables] or adhere to alcohol guidelines, is Osborne's supply-side approach in a different guise. Here, then, are some alternative suggestions. An all-party consensus to tackle poverty rather than simply tactics for rewarding \"hard-working families\". Macro-economic policies geared to full employment. A higher minimum wage. Legislation to make it easier for trade unions to organise. A mass programme of house building. And, an industrial strategy to rebuild Britain's manufacturing base, including the nurturing and protection of sectors seen as crucial to future growth. Additionally, a full-blooded assault on the tax dodging activities of the feral rich, and tougher price curbs on oligopolies. Alternatively, we could do what some of the bloggers demanded after the first episode of Benefits Street and \"shoot the poor\". Interestingly, this means capitalism only works for the rich. Karl Marx would be tickled by it.",

You go in as much more informed, but on the flip side, you don't understand the micro.&#xa0;And [learning] that was really fun for me, frankly.</p> <p>For two months before I started, I was coming in on Fridays just trying to learn the business. Since I started full-time, I don't have a permanent desk, so I sit with different teams every week and I really get to understand the work they are doing, the people on the team, what motivates them, what's exciting to them, the tools they use, where they want to see things get better. I like it so much, I'm still doing it. I'm making second and third rounds to various teams now. I have been sitting with tech for a while, and now I am moving downstairs to Gilt City team.</p> <p>It's just a great way to really learn, meet everybody, learn about all the different departments, how it comes together. I really enjoy getting into the details and understanding how you make it happen and most importantly what we can do to make it better.</p> <p><strong>It seems as if you are embedded in the culture of the company. How would you describe the culture here?</strong></p> <p>First of all, Gilt has always been a phenomenal mix of creativity, technology and analytics, and that kind of mix between super creative people and design people: you know, photographers, stylists, merchandise experts, web designers sitting alongside analytical and technology fire power. [It] is such an interesting combination and provides a very vibrant culture, a mix of right brain and left brain.</p> <p>Secondly, Gilt has always been a super innovative and fast paced culture. It has to be. Everyday we're putting on a new sale. Everyday, we're changing with what we have in our warehouse. And so, that pace of innovation is always a part of the culture.</p> <p>Third, I would say, there's lot of celebration and fun at Gilt. We have to attract and attain the best people, so there's so many different things we do to keep that culture vibrant and fun and innovative. We have this legendary Halloween party, picnics, pantries that are full of food, team events, shopping discounts. Just lots of things that make working at Gilt fun.</p> <p>Then there are things that I think we are adding, shifting the culture. One is a much greater focus on transparency, being really clear about the things that we need to do well. We have a scorecard [that] we shows the entire team. We put a lot of people through boot camp and finance training so they can understand the P&amp;L, or give people a lot more insight into what drives the business and what we can do to make the business perform at a higher level. That's something we have been putting a lot of energy and effort into.</p> <p>That's exciting for them. They like understanding the big picture and seeing how their jobs contribute to that. It gets them excited about the future and we can see that even in employee service scores, people are just feeling increasingly really excited about Gilt's future at just incredibly high level.</p> <p><strong>As the company grows, what do you look for in potential employees?</strong></p> <p>When I'm interviewing, I want to see someone who is passionate, I want to see someone who's done their research. I want to see someone who comes with a point of view about how they are going to contribute to Gilt. They are clearly excited about the job, they have done their research, they have done their homework. I obviously want to see applicable skills, that they have taken a risk before, that they have had big accomplishments, that they have occasionally stumbled, that they've learned from their stumbles, that they have longevity and persistence in a job.</p> <p>I can't stand job jumpers. One year here, two years there, one year here. It's just a huge turnoff to me.</p> <p>And then it comes down to, they have all that, they are passionate about the job, they can articulate how they can contribute, they understand what Gilt is, they've demonstrated real success in the past that would be applicable to Gilt. What it comes down for me to is: do I want work with this person? Can I learn from this person whatever their level? Are they going to inspire their peers to do more?</p> <p>We are an incredibly team-centered culture. So we need people who are ambassadors for our culture in some ways.</p> <p><strong>One of the big things about Gilt is the loyalty that you build between your brand and your followers. </strong></p> <p>Ever since the beginning, when [the founders] launched Gilt there was a clear sense of what Gilt was. It was a go-to place to be inspired for top designer deals, and everyday local experiences. To do that, we have to do four things incredibly well.</p> <p>We have to be exciting and have a sense of urgency. Shopping always was that. And then the online world kind of stripped it away. But Gilt brought it back.</p> <p>We have to be curated with a point of view. We can't just show everybody everything. It's not our thing. It's not exciting. It's not what they want. Gilt is not about the need, it's about the desire.</p> <p>We have to provide value and access. It has to be something that you can't get elsewhere. When they get it, it's exciting. Lastly we had to use data to be really relevant and personalized. If you're going to come every day, you don't want to see stuff that is not interesting to you.</p> <p>Our customers give us an inordinate amount of data. Our waitlist is three times the size of our revenue. Our customers are telling us a lot about what they like, what they want, what they're interested in ,and we have to use that in a way that makes the experience better for them every single time.</p> <p>That gets to two remarkable things about Gilt's audience: first, we are young and we are affluent. And we are engaged. And that combination of youth, affluence and engagement doesn't exist really anywhere on our level.</p> <p>Today's challenge for traditional retailers is not \"Do they have a good website?\" or \"Do they have a good mobile device?\" The question is: \"How do they get young affluent people excited?\" And I think Gilt does a great job of that.</p> <p>And then, secondly, because of that we have an incredible retention. So, three years later, we retain 87% of the revenue of any core brand. That's an incredible stat. It comes from us being a lifestyle brand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-80d1e93c-17b1-4232-8e7c-d338383b0442\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/25/1385392663826/2ab5f49a-6e91-4dc7-9e19-5f5c5d86a120-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"online shopping \" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/166040/online-holiday-shopping-rises-trails-venues.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=All%20Gallup%20Headlines\">53% of Americans</a> said it's very likely that they will do their holiday shopping online this year. Photograph: Eyebyte/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You have seen some of your sales shift to mobile.</strong></p> <p>Almost 45% of our revenue is on mobile. That's incredible. It's partially because we have this young, affluent audience and it's partially because of the 12 noon frenzy. It's partially because we have a great mobile application. But the exciting part for me is that the mobile audience, is highly engaged and there's more that we can do with it.</p> <p>There's unique features in mobile that we can increasingly think about. We launched the ability to take a picture of your face and flip through sunglasses and see what they look like. It is much harder to do that on your desktop.</p> <p>We have been thinking a lot about geo-location and how to target that. Maybe you love Kate Spade, maybe we should give you an offer to go into a Kate Spade story if you are nearby. There is a lot more with the mobile device that we can start thinking about different. But it's a very exciting part of our trajectory.</p> <p><strong>By moving desk all the time, you are basically networking within the company. What's your take on networking in general?</strong></p> <p>Look, I am a feminist through and through, a huge believer in women and I think this is a particularly important topic for women. Having said all that, sometimes I feel all that stuff just lacks authenticity. I am a huge believer in great results and believe that authentic relationships are the key to success.</p> <p>I guess I have a very extensive network as it turns out. But it wasn't because I sat there, and went around, going \"You know that person, can you connect me to them?\" It's just not my style.</p> <p>Over the course of working incredibly hard and being really passionate about what I do and delivering great results, I got to know some extraordinary people, many of whom have been, officially or unofficially, role models and mentors. And most of whom are still huge part of my life.</p> <p>But I wouldn't say I have ever been conscious of networking. As a matter of fact, I don't even like it.</p> <p>If you surround yourself with people who are better than you and whom you can learn from, and you produce great results and you are passionate about what you do, and if you lift other people up and if you build other people up along the way, I think you end up with a really extraordinary network. It's an end, not a means.</p> <p><strong>You must have to pencil in a lot of people on your calender.</strong></p> <p>The people I appreciate the most are those that I chose to mentor. And at Gilt, it's the same way. People who I know are doing great work, who are passionate about what they do, who are trying real hard, who need help, who need to be kicked in the butt about something, who need to be grown and shaped and developed. I reach out to those people and say, \"I want to spend time with you once a month.\" I am very direct. But it comes because I admire what they are doing and I know they can do more for us over time, or even just for themselves. I do those meetings with such an energy and passion.</p> <p>People who just call me up and say, \"You know, you're a Wharton alum and I'm a Wharton alum. Because of that, can you take my call or meet with me? Why wouldn't you invest because we're both Wharton alums?\" That kind of networking just feels so unauthentic to me.</p> <p><strong>Speaking of calendars, your life must be so busy, what with changing desks all the time \u2026</strong></p> <p>&#xa0;... and I am a mom!</p> <p><strong>How do you stay organized? Tell us your secret.</strong></p> <p>Being a mom forces you to be more organized. You don't have time. You get to a point where you'RE not sleeping enough, you'RE not exercising enough, these things go by the wayside. So with the time you have, you want to make as much of a contribution as you possibly can to your family, to your kids, to your husband, to your work, to your community. I think it forces discipline.</p> <p>Having said that, I am a hyper-organized person to begin with. I am a focused person. There are a lot of tools that I deploy to make that work. I'm incredibly structured about my day. I am in by 7.30 or 8am every morning. Earlier than everybody at Gilt. There's just a couple of us here early. Usually, I'll have breakfast across the street with an employee or something, and then I come over. But I leave at five o'clock every day, religiously. My husband does the same thing. We make dinner, bath time, reading time, Lego time, puzzle time. We get that really nice family connection and then I work 8-11, six nights a week.</p> <p>And I'm really structured about my travel; I could spend every night of the week at an event or traveling. The number of requests we get is pretty significant, but I only do things I really think will move Gilt forward, or if it's an issue I am really passionate about, like helping young women. I try to be really ruthless and sort of religious about what my priorities are and make sure that the way I spend my time matches with what I deem to be most important.</p> <p>And I don't go to bed at night without having daylight in my email: my inbox has to have less emails than what covers the whole inbox. I won't go to bed at night until that's clean. And I try really hard to always get back to people within 24 hours and not leave people hanging. I think it's rude.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s almost noon and shoppers all around US are waiting to see what Gilt has to offer today. The anticipation is driving them wild, but the wait is worth it. After all, Gilt is one way of the few ways that they can get luxury design items for a discounted price. \u201cAh, the noon frenzy\u201d, laughs Michelle Peluso, CEO of Gilt Groupe when I ask her about the company\u2019s strategy of launching their limited daily offers at noon. Visiting Gilt headquarter is any shopaholic's dream. On the way to meet Peluso, I catch a glimpse of a room packed with just shoes: rows and rows of amazing heels that even Carrie Bradshaw, the famed shoe lover of Sex and the City, would kill for. Yet it\u2019s not all just about the shoes. The company, which launched in 2007 and currently has 1,100 employees worldwide, offers a variety of items for women, men and children to its seven million members. And ever since February, Gilt has been run by Peluso, a former bank official who has been on its board for over four years. Kevin Ryan, the founder, wanted to move to the chairman role and wanted to bring in a new CEO and asked me to do that. And it took a while, because I was really loyal to my old company, Citigroup, but I joined full-time in February \u2026 I don't know if it's a demotion or a promotion to go from the board to being a CEO, but it's been an awesome transition.

      "bodyText": "Sales at Jaguar Land Rover have surged annually since the two ailing British brands were united under the ownership of the Tata Group in 2008. The purchase by Tata of both Land Rover and Jaguar from Ford for just over \u00a31bn was described as reverse colonialism almost six years ago, but manufacturing at its West Midlands bases has thrived ever since. Losses in 2009 were reversed as turnover trebled by 2013, and Jaguar Land Rover has recorded billion pound-plus annual profits for the last three years, adding around nine thousand employees to date with plans to recruit 1,700 more. While Tata's takeover was seen a shift in power from west to east, the firm's historical roots and tradition of employment rights sit alongside those of the most enlightened Victorian British industrialists. The Tata family, of the Parsee religion, started on the path to owning today's industrial giant by opening a textile mill in 1868, where workers were offered pensions and compensated for accidents.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "1 WE ARE ALL BUYING ONLINE Shoppers just can't get enough of the internet. We've been buying online for years, but the pace of change took even experienced retailers by surprise. Online sales of non-food items rose by nearly a fifth in December, according to the British Retail Consortium and accountant KPMG \u2013 the fastest rate since March 2010. In the grocery market as much as 15% of UK sales, worth \u00a3900m, is thought to have been booked online between 20 and 23 December, compared with an average of 5.5% throughout 2013. Stores which excel online, including John Lewis, House of Fraser and Next, enjoyed a bumper Christmas; those struggling to keep up, such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Morrisons, suffered. As shoppers' confidence in delivery systems grows, they leave online orders later and later. This probably means an end to Cyber Monday \u2013 the first working day in December, when millions of orders placed on work computers made it the busiest online shopping day of the year. This year, the Sunday and Monday of the following week were just as busy. 2 CRAZY FOR CLICK AND COLLECT Buying online may be popular but waiting in for deliveries is not. No surprise, then, that \"click and collect\" \u2013 a service devised by Argos, where shoppers buy or reserve items online then pick them up in a shop or other convenient location \u2013 is booming. According to research for mobile operator O2 by Conlumino, more than a third of shoppers use click and collect services, and use is expected to rise by 12% this year. John Lewis saw click and collect sales rise 60%, while Tesco said 70% of its online orders for fashion and homewares were collected in stores. Retailers are driving the trend with a range of new ideas \u2013 from Asda's pick-up points in tube station carparks, to Amazon lockers inside Co-op stores and the rise of Collect Plus, which lets shoppers pick up items from thousands of local convenience stores. 3 IT'S A MOBILE WORLD Who wants to shop at work with their boss looking over their shoulder? Online sales are being driven by smartphones and tablet computers, which shoppers use to browse and buy on the bus or from their sofa. Tesco said more than a third of its online grocery orders were placed on a mobile device in the runup to Christmas. John Lewis said three quarters of its web traffic on Christmas Day came from such gadgets. Marks &amp; Spencer said orders from tablet computers had more than doubled, while sales via phones were up 80%. Retailers are also seeing spikes in business at new times of the day \u2013 early morning, when people purchase from bed, and around 8pm, when shoppers are also watching TV. 4 WE ARE BUYING LESS FOOD With food-price inflation running at about 2.5%, shoppers are not only saving money by shopping around for a bargain, we are simply buying less food. Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons all admitted that the volume of food sold had fallen. Of course, the middle market stores have lost some food sales to discounters such as Aldi, but the signs are that consumers are also buying more carefully and throwing less away in a bid to save money and protect the environment. Figures from Wrap, the government-backed recycling and waste body, shows that since 2007 households have cut avoidable food waste by 21%. It says every household still throws away the equivalent of six meals a week, costing an average \u00a360 a month, so with finances under pressure the trend to cut waste is likely to continue. 5 GOODBYE OUT-OF-TOWN SUPERSTORES All the big supermarket chains admit that sales in their once all-conquering hypermarkets were down this Christmas as shoppers switched to buying little and often or ordering online. With petrol prices high, driving miles to save a few pounds in a big store \u2013 where you might also make impulse purchases \u2013 is far less popular. Sales at Morrisons, which has just 85 small local shops, dived 5.6%, while convenience store chains including the Co-op and Nisa saw strong growth. Sainsbury's and Marks &amp; Spencer were also helped by their large portfolio of smaller shops. Overall sales at Tesco, which has the most convenience stores, slid 2.4%, but it would have been worse without the 1.3% rise in underlying sales at its smaller shops. Chief executive Philip Clarke said Aldi and Lidl's strategy to \"get among the chimney pots\" in residential areas, was part of the reason for their success. 6 SHOPPERS LIKE DISCOUNT BUYS \u2013 AND PREMIUM RANGES Aldi and Lidl have been causing big problems for the big grocers all year, but in previous Christmases shoppers have returned to mainstream favourites for better-quality festive food. Morrisons chief executive Dalton Philips laid it out most clearly, admitting that his chain's sales had taken a battering as shoppers stayed with the discounters. The discount shops have raised their quality and are winning fans by flagging up luxury foods, from champagne to lobster, at Christmas. The non-food discounters, from Poundland to B&amp;M Bargains, are also thought to have had a good 2013, setting themselves up to for a jump onto the stock market this year. But it's not all about bargains. Major grocers, and mainstream clothing stores such as M&amp;S and Debenhams, appear to be suffering in the \"squeezed middle\". Shoppers with spare cash are opting for premium labels. In food, Waitrose and M&amp;S did well, as did upmarket fashion stores such as Ted Baker, House of Fraser and Jigsaw. 7 WE CAN'T RESIST A GADGET The major electronics retailers have yet to reveal their hand on Christmas trading, with Dixons and Home Retail Group, owner of Argos, both due to report on Thursday, but it seems clear that 2013 was the year of the gadget. Sales of clothing and old-fashioned toys took a battering as families snapped up iPads and new cheaper tablets such as Tesco's Hudl \u2013 the grocer sold 400,000 of the \u00a3119 devices \u2013 as well as games consoles Playstation 4 and Xbox One. John Lewis said it sold one iPad every 10 seconds in the runup to Christmas. 8 SHOPPERS ARE SAVVIER The traditional game of high street chicken is becoming suicidal for retailers as shoppers wait later and later to buy gifts in the hope of a bargain. Major retailers all talked of booming December sales and a lacklustre October and November, which spooked many into an early round of discounting. Mobile and online tools help shoppers compare prices and grab bargains more effectively than ever. Shoppers once loyal to a certain grocer have become promiscuous as they search for value and respond to a blizzard of discount vouchers. Tesco and Sainsbury's use their loyalty card schemes to target offers of big savings \u2013 such as \u00a36 off a \u00a340 shopping basket. Morrisons' old-fashioned spend and save plan just couldn't compete. Marks &amp; Spencer followed other retailers with an almost unprecedented 30% reduction on knitwear, and then all clothing, just before Christmas. It says this helped it maintain market share, but angry shoppers who splashed out early will be encouraged to buy later next year. They may also have returned items, then bought them again at the lower price. M&amp;S's profits are likely to show the cost of that move. 9 BLACK FRIDAY HAS LANDED The US discount day Black Friday burst onto British high streets this year. This has long been a tradition over the Atlantic, with retailers offering deals to coincide with the national holiday after Thanksgiving. Black Friday is so named because it is traditionally the day retailers begin to make a profit or move \"into the black\". US-owned retailers such as Asda and Amazon have used it for a while, but this year it was taken up by UK stores including John Lewis and Dixons, both of which intend to stick with the idea next year. 10 CHRISTMAS HAS GONE ALL SOCIAL The days of the cheesy celebrity-laden Crimbo ad campaign may be numbered. Yes, Heston Blumenthal was flashing his pans for Waitrose, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's clothes were falling off for Marks &amp; Spencer, but this year it was all about generating interest on the internet. John Lewis set the pace with its Disney-style bear and hare ad, which was launched with unbranded teaser ads on ITV aimed at generating chat on Twitter under the hashtag #sleepingbear. The ad went on to get more than 11m views on YouTube, while Sainsbury's clocked up more than 1m views for its Christmas in a Day mash-up of family videos. It's cheaper, apparently keeps shoppers more loyal and is an increasingly important part of the way retailers communicate with shoppers.",

    "webTitle": "Next makes Marks & Spencer look increasingly frumpy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At least he's honest. Marc Bolland, chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer, last week congratulated bitter rival Next for \"doing a better job\" than him of selling clothes over Christmas. Lord Wolfson, Next's boss, did more than a bit better. Next's sales in the runup to Christmas increased by 12%, compared with a 2% drop in M&amp;S's clothes sales \u2013 the 10th consecutive quarterly fall. Next, which has long been regarded as M&amp;S's little sister and which targets roughly the same market of twentysomething to fiftysomething professional women, is now forecast to overtake M&amp;S's profits for the first time. Wolfson, who is known for setting modest profit targets and then beating them, raised his full-year pre-tax forecasts for the year to 25 January to between \u00a3684m and \u00a3700m. That's an increase of at least 10% on last year, and a significant increase on October's forecast of \u00a3650m-\u00a3680m. More importantly \u2013 although Wolfson was too modest to gloat \u2013 it is also more than the \u00a3630m M&amp;S is expected to make in the year to March. M&amp;S's house broker, Citigroup, this week cut \u00a310m off its expectations due to the poor performance of the 130-year-old chain's general merchandise division, which is mostly clothes. It is not the first time M&amp;S has been embarrassed at the hands of its smaller rival. Just as London was preparing for the Olympics two years ago, Next overtook M&amp;S in terms of stock market value. At the time Wolfson, modest again, said: \"Either we are overvalued or M&amp;S is undervalued.\" The City thought otherwise and the gap has stretched ever since. Today Next is worth \u00a39.4bn, M&amp;S \u00a37.5bn. This is despite M&amp;S still having far more stores (766 compared with 500), and collecting much more in annual sales (\u00a310.4bn compared with less than \u00a34bn, according to forecasts for the current year). Analysts say Next is being rewarded for understanding its customers and for being able to consistently increase sales in decreasing or stagnant markets. Veteran retail consultant Richard Hyman says there is no secret behind its success. \"It's very simple: Next knows its customers tremendously well. It knows who it is selling to and what its market wants and, perhaps more importantly, what it doesn't want. That intimate knowledge lets it get its prices right first time. \"They've got the right product at the right time. All that sounds blindingly obvious \u2013 but not to Marks &amp; Spencer.\" Next, Hyman says, has targeted the same demographic for years: 25-to-45-year-old women, mostly in the Midlands. It has kept itself relatively on trend by losing customers at the top end and replacing them with fresh blood at the bottom end. The problem with M&amp;S, he says, is that it has the same customers as it had 10-20 years ago, but they are 10-20 years older. \"That has huge ramifications for the company that I'm not convinced they've recognised,\" he says. \"That ageing has made it more difficult for M&amp;S to get its fashion right.\" As a result, he believes, M&amp;S has all too often fallen into the trap of making its clothes too young for its core customers. It is a point M&amp;S's army of small shareholders made clear at a feisty annual meeting in 2012, when they demanded more dresses with sleeves. The company, which brought in former Debenhams boss and style guru Belinda Earl to overhaul its fashion ranges, has claimed it is listening and that 90% of dresses in its revamped ranges are sleeved. But even when it has got the clothes right, on occasion it has failed to order enough of them. In the autumn, M&amp;S's \u00a385 pink duster coat, worn by model Karen Elson in an advertising campaign, sold out within days and anyone wanting one couldn't find it for love nor money. Bolland was forced to admit that the \"carefully managed\" stock of the coat had sold out nationwide. \"You do not want 40,000 of the same coats walking around,\" he said. \"That is probably not the way to create some of the stylishness.\" Garry White, chief investment commentator at Charles Stanley, says that episode typifies M&amp;S's new problem: \"They got the product right, but didn't get the buying right. They should have had a lot more of it and it should have been much more expensive. Next got the price points relative to quality just right. The clothes don't fall apart, but aren't too expensive. \"M&amp;S doesn't know who its customers are. M&amp;S shouldn't be trying to go after the youth market \u2013 that's what TopShop's for.\" A surfeit of the wrong clothes this winter meant M&amp;S started its sale before Christmas, while Next held off until very early on Boxing Day. Hyman says the early sales may have helped M&amp;S's figures this year but warns: \"Who's going to buy for full price from M&amp;S next Christmas? No one.\" What is more, as well as getting the styles right, Next also \"gets the internet\". \"Next is all about the internet, the internet, the internet,\" White says. \"Customers are now so confident with its delivery that they were still ordering the weekend before Christmas Day, which fell on a Wednesday. A few years ago, people wouldn't feel confident ordering online five days before Christmas.\"",

      "body": "<p>At least he's honest. Marc Bolland, chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer, last week congratulated bitter rival Next for \"doing a better job\" than him of selling clothes over Christmas.</p> <p>Lord Wolfson, Next's boss, did more than a bit better. Next's sales in the runup to Christmas increased by 12%, compared with a 2% drop in M&amp;S's clothes sales \u2013 the 10th consecutive quarterly fall.</p> <p>Next, which has long been regarded as M&amp;S's little sister and which targets roughly the same market of twentysomething to fiftysomething professional women, is now forecast to overtake M&amp;S's profits for the first time.</p> <p>Wolfson, who is known for setting modest profit targets and then beating them, raised his full-year pre-tax forecasts for the year to 25 January to between \u00a3684m and \u00a3700m. That's an increase of at least 10% on last year, and a significant increase on October's forecast of \u00a3650m-\u00a3680m.</p> <p>More importantly \u2013 although Wolfson was too modest to gloat \u2013 it is also more than the \u00a3630m M&amp;S is expected to make in the year to March. M&amp;S's house broker, Citigroup, this week cut \u00a310m off its expectations due to the poor performance of the 130-year-old chain's general merchandise division, which is mostly clothes.</p> <p>It is not the first time M&amp;S has been embarrassed at the hands of its smaller rival. Just as London was preparing for the Olympics two years ago, Next overtook M&amp;S in terms of stock market value. At the time Wolfson, modest again, said: \"Either we are overvalued or M&amp;S is undervalued.\" The City thought otherwise and the gap has stretched ever since. Today Next is worth \u00a39.4bn, M&amp;S \u00a37.5bn.</p> <p>This is despite M&amp;S still having far more stores (766 compared with 500), and collecting much more in annual sales (\u00a310.4bn compared with less than \u00a34bn, according to forecasts for the current year).</p> <p>Analysts say Next is being rewarded for understanding its customers and for being able to consistently increase sales in decreasing or stagnant markets. Veteran retail consultant Richard Hyman says there is no secret behind its success. \"It's very simple: Next knows its customers tremendously well. It knows who it is selling to and what its market wants and, perhaps more importantly, what it doesn't want. That intimate knowledge lets it get its prices right first time.</p> <p>\"They've got the right product at the right time. All that sounds blindingly obvious \u2013 but not to Marks &amp; Spencer.\"</p> <p>Next, Hyman says, has targeted the same demographic for years: 25-to-45-year-old women, mostly in the Midlands. It has kept itself relatively on trend by losing customers at the top end and replacing them with fresh blood at the bottom end. The problem with M&amp;S, he says, is that it has the same customers as it had 10-20 years ago, but they are 10-20 years older.</p> <p>\"That has huge ramifications for the company that I'm not convinced they've recognised,\" he says. \"That ageing has made it more difficult for M&amp;S to get its fashion right.\" As a result, he believes, M&amp;S has all too often fallen into the trap of making its clothes too young for its core customers.</p> <p>It is a point M&amp;S's army of small shareholders made clear at a feisty annual meeting in 2012, when they demanded more dresses with sleeves. The company, which brought in former Debenhams boss and style guru Belinda Earl to overhaul its fashion ranges, has claimed it is listening and that 90% of dresses in its revamped ranges are sleeved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-426814718\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/11/1389433074767/Karen-Elson-in-the-pink-d-011.jpg\" alt=\"Karen Elson in the pink duster coat that proved so popular for M&S\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grace Coddington, Dame Helen Mirren, Laura Mvula, and Karen Elson, in the pink duster coat that proved so popular for M&S.

      "bodyText": "I first encountered Mark Carney on a funicular railway in Davos in 2009, during the annual World Economic Forum. We had both been to a Barclays Bank reception and, as I recall, were the only people in the carriage. \"Hi,\" said my companion. \"I'm Mark Carney. I'm the governor of the Central Bank of Canada. We haven't had a banking crisis.\" The scene shifts to 2013, and the runup \u2013 the long runup \u2013 to his appointment as governor of the Bank of England. This was made, after a long courtship, by our chancellor, who appeared to be starstruck by the George Clooney of central banking. The establishment's view is that the obvious internal candidate, my friend (now \"Sir\") Paul Tucker, had been ruled out on account of an unfortunate email exchange between him and Bob Diamond of, wait for it, Barclays Bank. My own view is that George Osborne was determined to employ an outsider, and that Tucker did not really stand a chance, despite being quoted at odds of 7-2 on at the bookmakers. (For non-racing readers, that meant that he was such a hot favourite that you would only win \u00a32 for every \u00a37 staked.) I also think that Tucker was a victim of email culture, and that if the private exchanges between Bank officials and City figures in pre-electronic days had been subject to such scrutiny, few would have escaped unscathed. However, Osborne got his man, and your correspondent was one of the more vociferous in criticising the extraordinarily generous financial terms on which he was appointed. The deal rankled all the more because Osborne, Carney's champion, is the lead player in the economics of austerity \u2013 a policy, with regard to the poor and disadvantaged, which he intends to go on applying to the point where even deputy prime minister Nick Clegg is becoming embarrassed. Now, this column did not get where it is today without trying to be fair-minded and sounding out the opinions of many of the people it meets. And, with regard to Carney, my general impression is that he is finding the job not quite as easy as running the Bank of Canada, and that he has been quite good at rubbing a number of his officials up the wrong way. It is also apparent that his commitment to \"forward guidance\" is causing increasing concern among City analysts, not least because the Bank's forecasts of unemployment \u2013 the indicator at the centre of \"guidance\" when it comes to criteria determining changes in interest rates \u2013 appear to have been overtaken by events. Nevertheless it is also my impression that Carney is going down well with the public \u2013 seeming to win the approval of everyone from finance directors to Steve, who brews my coffee in the Pistachio &amp; Pickle cafe. The same cannot be said for Osborne. Which brings us to the delicate question on so many people's lips: when are interest rates going to go up? It is a most interesting situation. Governments throughout most of my career have chosen the timing of an election to suit what they regard as their best interests, and the state of the economy has been a crucial factor. The economy is at last experiencing a period of rapid growth \u2013 needlessly delayed by Osborne \u2013 and there are those who think the boom could get out of hand between now and May 2015, and that \u2013 who knows? \u2013 the Bank might be forced to raise interest rates sharply. But Osborne insisted on a five-year term as part of the coalition agreement, and he and Cameron are unable to cut and run if their electoral chances suddenly look favourable. Well before his appointment, Carney was on record as believing that reliance on interest rates was not necessarily a first resort, and that other tools to control credit should be used first. And in his lecture to the Economic Club of New York on 9 December, he insisted that \"forward guidance\" about reluctance to raise interest rates \"reduces uncertainty by providing reassurance that monetary policy will not be tightened prematurely before the recovery is sufficiently entrenched to sustain higher rates\". It was obvious from his New York lecture that Carney thought the recovery still had a long way to go: \"Despite very low interest rates, resources are not fully employed. 850,000 more people are out of work than in the years before the crisis and GDP is around 20% below an extrapolation of its pre-crisis trend.\" The markets have become excited by the more recent improvement in the employment position; but unemployment is still far too high. I was impressed by Carney's New York lecture, not least by his sceptical attitude to those who think we are in for a period of \"secular stagnation\". My own belief is that theories of secular stagnation are revived on a cycle of their own, the last one being during the oil crisis in the 1970s. As Carney says, the US economy is more than 13 times larger than when the economist Alvin Hansen worried about stagnation. As for the shorter term, readers might care to dwell on Carney's observation, again in New York: \"Despite admirable progress by British households in recent years, aggregate debt levels remain high at 140% of incomes. In addition, housing activity is picking up and price growth appears to be gaining momentum. Moreover, the UK current account deficit is near record levels.\" So when will interest rates go up? Search me, guv.",

Nevertheless it is also my impression that Carney is going down well with the public \u2013 seeming to win the approval of everyone from finance directors to Steve, who brews my coffee in the Pistachio &amp; Pickle cafe.</p> <p>The same cannot be said for Osborne. Which brings us to the delicate question on so many people's lips: when are interest rates going to go up?</p> <p>It is a most interesting situation. Governments throughout most of my career have chosen the timing of an election to suit what they regard as their best interests, and the state of the economy has been a crucial factor.</p> <p>The economy is at last experiencing a period of rapid growth \u2013 needlessly delayed by Osborne \u2013 and there are those who think the boom could get out of hand between now and May 2015, and that \u2013 who knows? \u2013 the Bank might be forced to raise interest rates sharply. But Osborne insisted on a five-year term as part of the coalition agreement, and he and Cameron are unable to cut and run if their electoral chances suddenly look favourable.</p> <p>Well before his appointment, Carney was on record as believing that reliance on interest rates was not necessarily a first resort, and that other tools to control credit should be used first. And in his lecture to the<a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2013/speech696.pdf\" title=\"\"> Economic Club of New York on 9 December</a>, he insisted that \"forward guidance\" about reluctance to raise interest rates \"reduces uncertainty by providing reassurance that monetary policy will not be tightened prematurely before the recovery is sufficiently entrenched to sustain higher rates\".</p> <p>It was obvious from his New York lecture that Carney thought the recovery still had a long way to go: \"Despite very low interest rates, resources are not fully employed. 850,000 more people are out of work than in the years before the crisis and GDP is around 20% below an extrapolation of its pre-crisis trend.\"</p> <p>The markets have become excited by the more recent improvement in the employment position; but unemployment is still far too high.</p> <p>I was impressed by Carney's New York lecture, not least by his sceptical attitude to those who think we are in for a period of \"secular stagnation\". My own belief is that theories of secular stagnation are revived on a cycle of their own, the last one being during the oil crisis in the 1970s. As Carney says, the US economy is more than 13 times larger than when the economist Alvin Hansen worried about stagnation.</p> <p>As for the shorter term, readers might care to dwell on Carney's observation, again in New York: \"Despite admirable progress by British households in recent years, aggregate debt levels remain high at 140% of incomes. In addition, housing activity is picking up and price growth appears to be gaining momentum. Moreover, the UK current account deficit is near record levels.\"</p> <p>So when will interest rates go up? Search me, guv.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Roll up, roll up! Come and thrill as Mario Draghi defies death. Hold your breath in wonder as the maestro wobbles his way along the high wire. With no safety net, can Draghi make it from one side of the big top to the other?</p> <p>No question, Draghi is a class act. There have been a few wobbles, a bit of dicing with disaster, the odd gasp from the audience, but somehow he has stayed aloft. For the past 18 months, the president of the European Central Bank has kept the financial markets sweet and bought Europe's politicians time to sort out the deep structural problems of the single currency. In the main, he has done so by using words alone, and he has made it look easy.</p> <p>The big question for 2014 is whether Draghi can continue to rule the markets simply by using the gift of the gab. The now legendary \"whatever it takes\" speech in the summer of 2012 prevented Italy and Spain from being sucked into the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis; last week, Draghi was at his silver-tongued best when he said the ECB would keep policy loose for as long as possible and was prepared to take more aggressive action if it proved necessary. The only consideration, Draghi noted, was that any planned response would have to be legal under the ECB's constitution.</p> <p>It's easy to see why Draghi felt the need to speak. It is not just that the eurozone's recovery remains virtually undetectable; rather, it is that a combination of high unemployment, unused capacity and a strong euro is pushing the 18-nation single currency area closer and closer to deflation. Core inflation (the cost of living excluding fuel and food) in the eurozone is already at a record low of 0.7% and on course to go lower as the strength of the euro cuts the cost of imports.</p> <p>Four eurozone countries \u2013 Greece, Spain, Portugal and Cyprus \u2013 already have negative core inflation. That makes life difficult in two ways: it raises the real value of their debts and it means that real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates are higher than they are in better-performing countries such as Germany, where core inflation is above 1%.</p> <p>So Draghi's first aim is to talk down the level of the euro. That's not easy in current circumstances, with the Bank of Japan using quantitative easing to drive down the value of the yen and the Federal Reserve only gradually tapering away America's asset purchase programme. Any respite that the ECB president can provide to eurozone exporters will be modest, and temporary.</p> <p>Two further questions therefore arise: is there a case for more decisive ECB action and, if so, what should the policy response be?</p> <p>There is certainly a case for more stimulus from Frankfurt. Even leaving to one side the eurozone's structural weaknesses, growth is being impeded by three factors: currency strength, austerity and a more restrictive monetary policy than in the US, the UK or Japan. Businesses are not investing, credit flows are weak, unemployment is above 12%, and the banks are in a poor state.</p> <p>In terms of the policy response, the ECB should learn from other central banks and embark on its own QE programme. To be sure, this is a bit late in the day. Without doubt, a law of diminishing returns applies to asset-purchase programmes. But Europe is drifting towards Japan-style deflation, where it gets locked into low growth and high unemployment. It is time for something new from the trick cyclist.</p> <h2>One reason for Sands's unusual choice of sidekick</h2> <p>Peter Sands sent out conflicting signals last week when he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/09/standard-chartered-shock-departure-finance-director-richard-meddings\" title=\"\">named Mike Rees as his deputy at Standard Chartered</a>.
