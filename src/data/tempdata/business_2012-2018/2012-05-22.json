    "webTitle": "Strict austerity risks derailing global economic recovery, warns OECD", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Europe's leaders meet on Wednesday for crisis talks to rescue the euro amid a warning from the west's leading economic thinktank that persisting with strict austerity programmes risks a vicious circle that could derail the tentative recovery in the global economy. Shares rallied on hopes the summit in Brussels will find a solution to the debt crisis by backing proposals from the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, that will boost growth and create jobs. But tensions remained between Paris and Berlin, where Angela Merkel's government maintained its strong opposition to the creation of common eurobonds, which would cut the borrowing costs of the heavily indebted countries facing intense financial market pressure. In London, the FTSE 100 rose by 98 points, reversing part of last week's sharp fall, to close at 5,403 points, a rise of almost 2% on the day. German, French, Spanish and Italian bourses also recorded hefty gains as fears receded of an early departure of Greece from the single currency. In its half-yearly update on the global economy, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said the 17-nation single currency area was on course to contract by 0.1% this year \u2013 with deep contraction in the countries of southern Europe \u2013 but said a worsening of the debt crisis could result in output falling by as much as 2%. The OECD, which has 34 rich-country members, said it expected Greece to contract by 5.3%, Portugal by 3.2%, Spain by 1.6% and Italy by 0.9%. While pencilling in a return to modest 0.9% growth in 2013, the OECD's chief economist, Pier Carlo Padoan, said: \"The risk is increasing of a vicious circle, involving high and rising sovereign indebtedness, weak banking systems, excessive fiscal consolidation and lower growth.\" Padoan urged Europe's leaders to adopt a \"growth compact\", which would help countries tackle their budget deficits through faster expansion. With developing countries such as China still growing strongly, the thinktank said global growth this year would be 3.4%, down from 3.6% in 2011, before rising to 4.2% in 2013. But growth among OECD members would be held back by Europe and would ease from 1.8% to 1.6% in 2012 before recovering to 2.2% in 2013. Of the big rich nations, the US and Japan would grow most strongly, while Britain is expected to grow by just 0.5% this year, accelerating to 1.9% in 2013. \"We see a slow rebound of growth in the United States driven mostly by private demand, some pickup in Japan and moderate to strong growth in emerging economies,\" Padoan said. \"We also see flat growth in the euro area which hides important differences, with northern countries growing and southern countries in recession.\" He expressed concern about a debt default in Greece and the shaky condition of Spain's banks, but said the emergency action by the European Central Bank, including a \u20ac1tn (\u00a3808bn) liquidity injection, had so far prevented the debt crisis from spiralling out of control. \"If the situation gets worse, there are ways to enhance the firewall capacity, which could include a stronger intervention or role of the ECB,\" Padoan said. In contrast to the eurozone, the US was expected to continue to benefit from easy credit conditions and ultra-loose monetary policy, with the world's biggest economy forecast to grow 2.4% this year and 2.6% in 2013. Japan's 2% growth this year would be boosted by a construction boom after the tsunami in 2011, while China would expand by 8.2% in 2012 and 9.3% in 2013. The OECD predicted the UK would recover this year from its double-dip recession over the winter. The thinktank maintained its previous 0.5% growth forecast for 2012 while raising its 2013 prediction a notch to 1.9%. \"Fiscal consolidation is a drag on growth,\" it said. \"However \u2026 fiscal policy remains heavily constrained. The ambitious government plan to restore fiscal sustainability remains on track and appropriate despite disappointing economic growth.\" David Cameron's coalition government has lost popularity and come under pressure to change course as austerity measures have hit demand, leading to the UK's second recession in four years, but the OECD said the downturn would be temporary and that after weak growth in the first half of 2012, the economy would then start to pick up speed. \"Growth will remain weak in the first half of 2012, but should gain momentum thereafter, with private consumption supported by higher real incomes, as inflation slows and exports and business investment revive with stronger external demand,\" the OECD said. However, the thinktank warned that the economy faced a number of risks. A weaker global economy could hit exports, while global financial turmoil might tighten financial conditions, and higher oil prices would hurt consumption. Bank withdrawals Almost 25% of deposits have been withdrawn from Greek banks in the last two years but outflows have been small from other banking systems inside the so-called periphery, according to Barclays analysts. While Greek deposits are falling, those at Portuguese lenders have risen to record highs, while Spanish and Italian deposits have fallen 3% and 2% respectively. \"Talk of a possible exit of Greece from the European monetary union has sparked fears about deposit outflows from other peripheral countries, but these concerns are not new and evidence does not indicate material outflows from Spain, Italy, Ireland, and Portugal,\" the analysts said. Even so, fears of a Greek exit from the eurozone have sparked debate about whether there should be an EU-wide guarantee for the single currency area. At the moment, the \u20ac100,000 deposit guarantees are paid for by national banking systems \u2013 which should prevent the need for any deposits to be withdrawn \u2013 but there are suggestions that the cost should be spread across the eurozone. Barclays analysts said this would not make a difference. \"A EU-wide deposit guarantee scheme could be on the agenda in upcoming summit meetings. We believe such a proposal would fail to solve the challenges facing the current European deposit insurance scheme. While it would enhance the creditworthiness of the guarantor, it would still not protect against currency redenomination,\" the analysts said. Economist at UBS believe that Greece will remain in the euro because the costs of exit are \"excessive\" to both Greece and the euro area. Local opinion polls show the majority of Greeks want to remain in the single currency. The UBS economists argue that if Greece considers leaving, the markets and bank depositors will all anticipate the event. \"This anticipation of exit would likely result in economic disorder,\" the UBS analysts said. \"The anticipation, and not the act of leaving, will in all probability lead to the cessation of international trade in the conventional sense, the ability of the government to raise any finance in the markets, and bank runs.\" The UBS analysts point out that the concerns are not about the strength of banks themselves. \"In the event of a Greek exit, contagion risks clearly exist. There seems to be a great deal of official complacency about the ability of firewalls to prevent this. The risk lies in the contagion of bank runs. Bank runs, if they occur, will likely arise because of existential risks about the euro, rather than solvency or liquidity risks about banking systems,\" the UBS economists warned. Jill Treanor",

      "body": "<p>Europe's leaders meet on Wednesday for crisis talks to rescue the euro amid a warning from the west's leading economic thinktank that persisting with strict austerity programmes risks a vicious circle that could derail the tentative recovery in the global economy.</p> <p>Shares rallied on hopes the summit in Brussels will find a solution to the debt crisis by backing proposals from the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, that will boost growth and create jobs.</p> <p>But tensions remained between Paris and Berlin, where Angela Merkel's government maintained its strong opposition to the creation of common eurobonds, which would cut the borrowing costs of the heavily indebted countries facing intense financial market pressure.</p> <p>In London, the FTSE 100 rose by 98 points, reversing part of last week's sharp fall, to close at 5,403 points, a rise of almost 2% on the day. German, French, Spanish and Italian bourses also recorded hefty gains as fears receded of an early departure of Greece from the single currency.</p> <p>In its <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/document/16/0,3746,en_21571361_44315115_50405584_1_1_1_1,00.html\" title=\"\">half-yearly update on the global economy</a>, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said the 17-nation single currency area was on course to contract by 0.1% this year \u2013 with deep contraction in the countries of southern Europe \u2013 but said a worsening of the debt crisis could result in output falling by as much as 2%.</p> <p>The OECD, which has 34 rich-country members, said it expected Greece to contract by 5.3%, Portugal by 3.2%, Spain by 1.6% and Italy by 0.9%.</p> <p>While pencilling in a return to modest 0.9% growth in 2013, the OECD's chief economist, Pier Carlo Padoan, said: \"The risk is increasing of a vicious circle, involving high and rising sovereign indebtedness, weak banking systems, excessive fiscal consolidation and lower growth.\" Padoan urged Europe's leaders to adopt a \"growth compact\", which would help countries tackle their budget deficits through faster expansion.</p> <p>With developing countries such as China still growing strongly, the thinktank said global growth this year would be 3.4%, down from 3.6% in 2011, before rising to 4.2% in 2013. But growth among OECD members would be held back by Europe and would ease from 1.8% to 1.6% in 2012 before recovering to 2.2% in 2013. Of the big rich nations, the US and Japan would grow most strongly, while Britain is expected to grow by just 0.5% this year, accelerating to 1.9% in 2013.</p> <p>\"We see a slow rebound of growth in the United States driven mostly by private demand, some pickup in Japan and moderate to strong growth in emerging economies,\" Padoan said.</p> <p>\"We also see flat growth in the euro area which hides important differences, with northern countries growing and southern countries in recession.\"</p> <p>He expressed concern about a debt default in Greece and the shaky condition of Spain's banks, but said the emergency action by the European Central Bank, including a \u20ac1tn (\u00a3808bn) liquidity injection, had so far prevented the debt crisis from spiralling out of control.</p> <p>\"If the situation gets worse, there are ways to enhance the firewall capacity, which could include a stronger intervention or role of the ECB,\" Padoan said.</p> <p>In contrast to the eurozone, the US was expected to continue to benefit from easy credit conditions and ultra-loose monetary policy, with the world's biggest economy forecast to grow 2.4% this year and 2.6% in 2013.</p> <p>Japan's 2% growth this year would be boosted by a construction boom after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/11/japan-earthquake-aftermath-economy-insurance\" title=\"\">the tsunami in 2011</a>, while China would expand by 8.2% in 2012 and 9.3% in 2013.</p> <p>The OECD predicted the UK would recover this year from its double-dip recession over the winter. The thinktank maintained its previous 0.5% growth forecast for 2012 while raising its 2013 prediction a notch to 1.9%. \"Fiscal consolidation is a drag on growth,\" it said. \"However \u2026 fiscal policy remains heavily constrained. The ambitious government plan to restore fiscal sustainability remains on track and appropriate despite disappointing economic growth.\"</p> <p>David Cameron's coalition government has lost popularity and come under pressure to change course as austerity measures have hit demand, leading to the UK's second recession in four years, but the OECD said the downturn would be temporary and that after weak growth in the first half of 2012, the economy would then start to pick up speed.</p> <p>\"Growth will remain weak in the first half of 2012, but should gain momentum thereafter, with private consumption supported by higher real incomes, as inflation slows and exports and business investment revive with stronger external demand,\" the OECD said.</p> <p>However, the thinktank warned that the economy faced a number of risks. A weaker global economy could hit exports, while global financial turmoil might tighten financial conditions, and higher oil prices would hurt consumption.</p> <h2><strong>Bank withdrawals</strong></h2> <p>Almost 25% of deposits have been withdrawn from Greek banks in the last two years but outflows have been small from other banking systems inside the so-called periphery, according to Barclays analysts.</p> <p>While Greek deposits are falling, those at Portuguese lenders have risen to record highs, while Spanish and Italian deposits have fallen 3% and 2% respectively. \"Talk of a possible exit of Greece from the European monetary union has sparked fears about deposit outflows from other peripheral countries, but these concerns are not new and evidence does not indicate material outflows from Spain, Italy, Ireland, and Portugal,\" the analysts said.</p> <p>Even so, fears of a Greek exit from the eurozone have sparked debate about whether there should be an EU-wide guarantee for the single currency area. At the moment, the \u20ac100,000 deposit guarantees are paid for by national banking systems \u2013 which should prevent the need for any deposits to be withdrawn \u2013 but there are suggestions that the cost should be spread across the eurozone.</p> <p>Barclays analysts said this would not make a difference. \"A EU-wide deposit guarantee scheme could be on the agenda in upcoming summit meetings. We believe such a proposal would fail to solve the challenges facing the current European deposit insurance scheme. While it would enhance the creditworthiness of the guarantor, it would still not protect against currency redenomination,\" the analysts said.</p> <p>Economist at UBS believe that Greece will remain in the euro because the costs of exit are \"excessive\" to both Greece and the euro area. Local opinion polls show the majority of Greeks want to remain in the single currency. The UBS economists argue that if Greece considers leaving, the markets and bank depositors will all anticipate the event. \"This anticipation of exit would likely result in economic disorder,\" the UBS analysts said.</p> <p>\"The anticipation, and not the act of leaving, will in all probability lead to the cessation of international trade in the conventional sense, the ability of the government to raise any finance in the markets, and bank runs.\"</p> <p>The UBS analysts point out that the concerns are not about the strength of banks themselves. \"In the event of a Greek exit, contagion risks clearly exist.

      "bodyText": "The euro crisis is coming to a head with many experts predicting that it is inevitable that Greece will leave the single currency. Leaders from the 27 countries meet in Brussels on Wednesday for emergency talks on how to fix the problem. Why is everyone suddenly talking about eurobonds? The idea of joint borrowing has been circulating for at least 12 months, but Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the newly elected French president, has made it clear that he intends to push for a eurobond at Wednesday's meeting of European leaders, as part of an alternative to pursuing austerity alone as the solution to the debt crisis. What is a eurobond, exactly? It is a collective debt: part of the problem facing some eurozone countries is that they are struggling to borrow from financial markets at affordable interest rates. If instead the European commission, for example, could borrow on behalf of all eurozone member states by issuing joint bonds, the cost could be lowered for countries such as Italy and Spain, because investors could be confident that stronger countries stood behind their debts. Analysts calculate that Portugal, for example, would see annual repayments fall by \u20ac15bn, or almost 9% of its GDP, as its interest rate fell to the eurozone average. Over time, the outstanding debts of countries such as Greece could be turned into eurobonds and paid off by the eurozone as a whole. The policy would send a powerful message of solidarity, making it harder for credit-ratings agencies and investors to target individual countries. The Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, and the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have recently thrown their weight behind the idea. The European Central Bank (ECB) is also in favour. How did we get here? For much of the euro's first decade, financial markets treated many euro countries as though they were issuing common bonds, with countries such as Greece and Italy paying little more to borrow than Germany or France. Investors simply assumed that eurozone countries were yoked together for all time, and if one got into trouble, it would ultimately be bailed out by its partners. These cut-price loans gave governments little incentive to reform; and while in theory the eurozone's stability and growth pact was meant to impose strict deficit limits to prevent countries going astray, the targets were repeatedly missed, including by Germany and France, and no action was taken. After the credit crunch, when the most severe recession in decades had pushed governments deep into the red, doubts began to emerge about whether, and how, Greece and others could afford to repay their heavy debt burdens. Without any agreed bailout mechanism, markets suddenly began to assess the solvency of each country separately and the cost of borrowing shot up across recession-hit states, driving them towards budgetary crisis. Despite two bailouts for Greece, the question of whether eurozone countries will stand with each other, come what may, has yet to be resolved. Sounds great. Why don't they just do it? Eurobonds might sound great to Greece, but they go fundamentally against Germany's approach to resolving the crisis. Collectivising debt removes the incentive for individual countries to put their own public finances in order. It also opens up a so-called \"moral hazard\" problem: if profligate behaviour goes unpunished, what's to stop any country going on the national equivalent of a giant bender and expecting Germany to pick up the tab? If Germany's borrowing costs rose to the eurozone average, it could cost Berlin an extra \u20ac50bn a year in repayments \u2013 almost 2% of its GDP. There are political and constitutional problems with the idea for Germany too: the constitutional court has made clear that it is not willing to sanction open-ended bailouts of other countries, which might well make eurobonds unconstitutional, and German voters \u2013 the fabled Swabian housewives summoned up by politicians to represent their frugal citizens \u2013 may not be ready to bail out the single currency zone in the way the policy implies. Even if the Germans signed up, would eurobonds resolve the crisis? No. They could help to calm the market panic and ease the immediate budgetary crisis of some countries, including Italy and Spain. But a eurobond would do nothing to reduce overall levels of debt, let alone tackle the underlying structural problem that countries such as Greece are simply unable to compete fairly with their eurozone partners. Don't euro leaders usually come up with a fudge when they can't agree on something? Yes. There are modest versions of a eurobond, where countries would still be responsible for the majority of their debts, with the commission just picking up the riskiest slice, for example. Such an arrangement might be more palatable than a full-blown collectivisation of the debt. But the less ambitious the plan, the less likely it would be to succeed. There is also a proposal on the table for \u20ac230m of so-called \"project bonds\", which would see euro countries jointly raise finance for specific infrastructure schemes aimed at creating jobs and boosting growth. This would be a drop in the ocean, and do nothing to resolve the mountain of outstanding debt; but it might be enough of a sop to Hollande for him to be able to claim he's shifted the debate towards growth. So what will happen next? It's impossible to say, but so far there is no evidence that the stern talking-to Merkel received from her G8 partners at the weekend has softened Germany's opposition to eurobonds; so unless politicians' hands are forced by financial markets, we're unlikely to see radical, catch-all solutions like this. Instead, we're likely to be stuck with more muddling-through. Dinner party one-liner: It's all very well but Angela won't wear it. So what are the chances for the eurobond solution? Angela Merkel and her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, have repeatedly expressed their opposition but they will face intense pressure from Hollande and his Germanophone finance minister, Pierre Moscovici. Monti also backs the idea, and has previously had Merkel's ear \u2013 but Italy would be a major beneficiary so he's likely to be seen as talking his own book. Another powerful Italian, ECB president Mario Draghi, favours eurobonds, but so far Germany has paid little heed to his demands for more rescue measures. David Cameron has also been urging a more collective approach on the UK's euro-neighbours, but his view counts for little in Germany after he infuriated Merkel by vetoing a new European treaty last year.",

      "bodyText": "Amid all the chatter about how to simplify executive pay, Fidelity Worldwide Investment is contemplating whether to throw its weight behind an idea requiring boardroom bosses to hold \"career shares\". Trelawny Williams, director of Fidelity, speaking at the Investor Relations Society annual conference on Tuesday, indicated that at the very least long-term incentive plans should run for five years, rather than the current three years. While the \"shareholder spring\" continues, he also had a warning for the chairs of remuneration committees, who could find themselves at the receiving end of more negative votes over boardroom pay. On pay, Williams said the two areas Fidelity was focusing on during its review of its own policies towards pay were \"duration and simplicity\". The debate is going on within Fidelity about precisely how to set out its requirements for boardroom pay. \"Ideally \u2013 I stress the world ideally, I don't think we're going to make this a requirement \u2013 we'd love some of these shares to be held through to termination of employment,\" he said. This would make directors \"material shareholders\" in companies, and might even start to give them a clearer focus. He raised HSBC as an example of a company with this \"career share\" idea. The bank introduced a new pay plan last year that requires directors to hold shares until they retire. But when the bank put its pay policies to the vote at last year's annual meeting, 15% of investors failed to back them despite months of lobbying by the bank's non-executive directors. At Friday's annual meeting, HSBC will discover whether investors have been won round \u2013 or whether they still need more convincing.",

This would make directors \"material shareholders\" in companies, and might even start to give them a clearer focus.</p> <p>He raised HSBC as an example of a company with this \"career share\" idea. The bank introduced a new pay plan last year that requires directors to hold shares until they retire. But when the bank put its pay policies to the vote at last year's annual meeting, 15% of investors failed to back them despite months of lobbying by the bank's non-executive directors. At Friday's annual meeting, HSBC will discover whether investors have been won round \u2013 or whether they still need more convincing.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The leader of Greece's radical left coalition, Alexis Tsipras, has appealed to Germans to show solidarity towards the embattled, debt-ridden Greeks, telling them that his country's economic woes were those of a whole continent. On the Berlin leg of a charm offensive to win over European politicians, the 37-year old, whose Syriza coalition has a good chance of securing victory at a repeat election on 17 June, stressed that he wanted to work with the Germans to \"find a solution to our joint problem\". Following a visit to Paris on Monday, Tsipras met likeminded, anti-capitalist far-left politicians in Berlin. He said the trenchant views of Angela Merkel's German government on the eurozone debt crisis and her adherence to unpopular austerity measures were part of the problem. \"It would be helpful if we focused on this as a geographical problem facing the whole of Europe rather than concentrating on one country and looking to destroy a nation of peoples,\" he said. He said he wanted to \"deliver a message of friendship, of hope\", adding: \"I want to appeal to your sense of solidarity and ... to persuade the Germans that we're not trying to blackmail you.\" The political turmoil facing Europe \"affects you, too,\" he said, adding that the crisis was the result of a politics that had \"largely failed\" and needed to be stopped.

Germany has been the hardest nation for the Greeks to win over to their argument that austerity measures amount to a form of what Tsipras referred to as \"national suicide\". He did not get the audience with Merkel that he had wished for, but said he \"would insist on it\" if he was elected next month. He said he did not agree with many of the policies of the woman he refers to as \"Madame Merkel\" \u2013 which for Greek audiences conjures up the image of a dominatrix in an Athens red light district \u2013 and he has accused her of treating Greece like a \"protectorate\".

He said the Greeks were \"not as we're portrayed in the media\", but were \"desperate to stand on our own two feet\", and were not warring with each other, but against the \"financial markets\", \"big business\" and \"capitalism\". Greeks needed a programme that supported growth, creation of work places and investment, Tsipras said, so that they could pay back their debts and start reforming every aspect of Greek life from its health system and its public sector to its black market economy, and begin stemming a brain drain that meant all its \"best young scientists\" were going to work in Germany. He appealed to Germans to keep coming to Greece; there have been reports that German holiday bookings to the country have plunged, somewhat due to fears that they might face anti-German sentiment. \"We are the most hospitable country and remain as warm as ever towards the Germans,\" he insisted.",

It may be because Britain has been the international poster child for austerity over the past couple of years and it would encourage backsliding by other, less determined, governments if the Fund gave Osborne the signal to let up. Those of a cynical bent might say that Osborne is getting his reward for being one of the first to back Lagarde for the IMF job.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, the Fund's support does provide important political cover for the chancellor. It is, though, only conditional support and it was relatively easy for the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, to state that the Fund's analysis of the UK economy was pretty much the same as his own. The IMF's view is that the Bank of England should take responsibility in the first instance for getting the economy moving again, but official interest rates are already at 0.5% and the last two doses of quantitative easing appear to have had relatively modest effects.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the latest borrowing figures show that the underlying position has deteriorated since this time last year as growth has weakened. The Fund says a change of course from Osborne will only be needed if the economy turns out to be significantly weaker than forecast. After the woeful performance of the economy in the past two years, Balls is perfectly entitled to ask how much worse things have to get.</p>",

It may be because Britain has been the international poster child for austerity over the past couple of years and it would encourage backsliding by other, less determined, governments if the Fund gave Osborne the signal to let up. Those of a cynical bent might say that Osborne is getting his reward for being one of the first to back Lagarde for the IMF job. Whatever the reason, the Fund's support does provide important political cover for the chancellor. It is, though, only conditional support and it was relatively easy for the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, to state that the Fund's analysis of the UK economy was pretty much the same as his own. The IMF's view is that the Bank of England should take responsibility in the first instance for getting the economy moving again, but official interest rates are already at 0.5% and the last two doses of quantitative easing appear to have had relatively modest effects. Meanwhile, the latest borrowing figures show that the underlying position has deteriorated since this time last year as growth has weakened. The Fund says a change of course from Osborne will only be needed if the economy turns out to be significantly weaker than forecast. After the woeful performance of the economy in the past two years, Balls is perfectly entitled to ask how much worse things have to get.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's annual inflation rate fell to its lowest level in more than two years last month as bargains on the high street and a post-Easter cut in air fares helped keep price increases in check. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index rose by 3% in the year to April, an unexpectedly sharp drop from the 3.5% annual rate recorded in March. City analysts said the fall in inflation from its recent peak of 5.2% in September 2011 would help ease the squeeze on real incomes, which has been a factor in depressing consumer demand during the economy's slide into a double-dip recession over the winter. But evidence of the weakness of the economy was underlined by separate ONS data showing an underlying deterioration in the state of the public finances. The transfer of the Royal Mail pension scheme to the state provided a \u00a328bn windfall for the exchequer in April, resulting in a monthly surplus of \u00a316.5bn. Once the one-off Royal Mail effect was stripped out, however, net borrowing in April stood at \u00a311.5bn \u2013 up from \u00a39.1bn in the same month in 2011.

      "bodyText": "HomeServe, one of the biggest home repair insurers, is under investigation by the Financial Services Authority for mis-selling, the company has admitted. The revelation sent its shares plunging 28% to 164p as the firm added it would be shrinking its UK operations by half a million customers. The company, which billed itself as the \"fifth emergency service\", could face a hefty fine from the City watchdog over what it called \"certain historic issues\", although the investigation is likely to take several months. Chief executive Richard Harpin said the alleged mis-selling had damaged the business and hinted that he expected the company to be fined. He said: \"The problems have had an impact on our brand, certainly in the short term, but my hope is this hasn't done any long-term damage because we have made dramatic changes. \"We were told last Friday by the FSA that they will be investigating, and that could probably lead to a fine.\" He added: \"I would suggest the share price is down not because of the FSA investigation but because we have re-based the business down 20% in 2014.\" The company is to make 250 staff redundant on top of the 200 jobs shed last year. Following the collapse in HomeServe's share price, the company has come on to the radar of fund managers specialising in distressed and bombed-out stocks. Tom Dobell, manager of M&amp;G's \u00a38bn Recovery fund, said last week that he had recently bought a significant holding in HomeServe in the belief that it will recover from its current lows. The company's revelation is the latest problem to hit the business, once one of the darlings of the stock market. Earlier this year it was fined \u00a3750,000 by the communications watchdog, Ofcom, for making excessive numbers of silent cold calls. Last year, bosses suspended the entire telesales department for six weeks. The suspension came three days after FSA officers visited the company, although HomeServe claims this was unrelated. Fears had been raised by customers and staff that scripts used by telesales workers had been misleading and complaints had been ignored. The company said the scripts have changed and staff were retrained during the six week closure in October, although cold calling only restarted in January this year. It also reviewed 48,000 complaints from the extremely cold 2010/11 winter when the service appeared to be overstretched, leaving customers without heating and with freezing pipes. Bosses plan on focusing the UK business on generating a premium customer base, removing those on discounted rates. It currently has 2.7 million UK customers and will cut this to 2.2-2.4 million. Harpin said: \"We took swift and comprehensive action to address the issues that we identified in the UK and are totally committed to restoring our customer focus. We are strengthening our management teams, retraining staff and continuing to make significant investments in customer service.\" It comes as HomeServe revealed pre-tax profits were up 8% to \u00a3126m. The company, which also has operations in Spain, the US and France, and is looking at expanding to Germany, revealed UK revenues were down \u00a35.4m to \u00a3353.5m due to the suspension. Adam Scorer, director of policy and external affairs at Consumer Focus, welcomed the FSA's decision to investigate. He said: \"Customers will clearly have had very high expectations of any firm that dubbed itself the 'fifth emergency service' and HomeServe must live up to its promises. \"It is very welcome that the FSA is investigating the accusations HomeServe faces of mis-selling.

      "standfirst": "International Monetary Fund says Bank of England should cut interest rates from 0.5% and boost quantitative easing", 
      "body": "<p>Britain needs a plan B. That was the stark message from the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday as it announced the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/may/22/imf-bank-of-england-rate-cut-growth\" title=\"\">findings of its checkup on the UK economy</a>.</p> <p>The Washington-based Fund says growth is weak, unemployment too high and the risks are clearly weighted to the downside. Extra stimulus, it says, is needed and needed now.</p> <p>So, game and set and match to the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, who has been warning George Osborne for the past 18 months that the government's austerity package is too much, too soon for an economy as enfeebled as Britain's at a time when its major trading partner, Europe, is involved in a life-or-death struggle to save the single currency?</p> <p>Well, not quite. The IMF says plan B should involve the Bank of England cutting interest rates from their already record-low level of 0.5% and chucking some more newly minted money at the economy through the process known as quantitative easing. Only if that fails to do the trick does the Fund think the chancellor should resort to fiscal policy \u2013 decisions affecting tax and spending \u2013 to boost demand. As far as the Fund is concerned, deliberately increasing borrowing in an attempt to stimulate demand is plan C not plan B. It would, however, support further curbs on public sector pay so that spending could be increased on infrastructure projects.

      "bodyText": "Britain needs a plan B. That was the stark message from the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday as it announced the findings of its checkup on the UK economy. The Washington-based Fund says growth is weak, unemployment too high and the risks are clearly weighted to the downside. Extra stimulus, it says, is needed and needed now. So, game and set and match to the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, who has been warning George Osborne for the past 18 months that the government's austerity package is too much, too soon for an economy as enfeebled as Britain's at a time when its major trading partner, Europe, is involved in a life-or-death struggle to save the single currency? Well, not quite. The IMF says plan B should involve the Bank of England cutting interest rates from their already record-low level of 0.5% and chucking some more newly minted money at the economy through the process known as quantitative easing. Only if that fails to do the trick does the Fund think the chancellor should resort to fiscal policy \u2013 decisions affecting tax and spending \u2013 to boost demand. As far as the Fund is concerned, deliberately increasing borrowing in an attempt to stimulate demand is plan C not plan B. It would, however, support further curbs on public sector pay so that spending could be increased on infrastructure projects. This would keep borrowing unchanged, while shifting spending to sectors of the economy deemed to have higher growth potential. Osborne was, therefore, able to say that the IMF had endorsed his approach, which relies on keeping fiscal policy tight so that the Bank of England can keep monetary policy loose. \"The IMF could not be clearer today: Britain needs to deal with its debts, and the government's fiscal policy is the appropriate one \u2013 and it is an essential part of our road to recovery.\" So game, set and match to Osborne then? That's not the case either. The government's approach will only work if three key conditions are met: that further action by the Bank of England is not the equivalent of pushing on a piece of string; that the welcome fall in inflation boosts real incomes and consumer spending; and that the euro does not implode over the coming few months, taking the UK economy down with it. The threat is that growth is even weaker this year than the 0.8% pencilled in by the Office for Budget Responsibility, pushing up the level of public borrowing. If that were to happen, the advice of Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the IMF, will clearly change. \"If the economy turns out to be significantly weaker than forecast, the pace of fiscal consolidation should be eased \u2026 and fiscal stimulus should be considered,\" she said at Tuesday's joint press conference with Osborne. Given that economic output is still 4% below its peak level in 2008, the government's growth estimates have been relentlessly cut since the election two years ago, and a third successive quarter of negative growth is now in prospect for the three months to June, it is arguable that the economy has already proved to be \"significantly weaker\" than forecast.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are moving higher as eurozone politicians jostle for position ahead of Wednesday's key EU summit, but positive news from China has lifted mining shares. Rio Tinto is the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, up 101p at \u00a329.24 after reports suggested China will accelerate infrastructure spending to help boost its slowing economy. The government has asked for project proposals by the end of June, said the China Securities Journal, including those initially intended for the end of the year. Other miners also benefited from the news, with Antofagasta adding 31p to \u00a310.61 and Xstrata up 23.6p at 966.6p. Indonesian-focused Bumi is 54.1p better at 437.1p after Barclays began coverage with an overweight rating and 565p price target. The bank said issues about debt and political change were improving, and Bumi was now at a turning point: We believe that under new management the company can continue to ease its debt burden, push through a strong expansion scheme and improve corporate governance. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 26.27 points at 5330.75, helped by better than expected UK inflation figures. But downbeat comments from the OECD and IMF regarding the economic effects of the eurozone crisis mean the index has come off its best levels.
