      "bodyText": "The polls will be opening in less than 13 hours and it feels like time for a closing summary. Germany has softened its stance on Grexit and indicated that any possible Greek exit from the eurozone may only be temporary. The German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said Greeks would not be left in the lurch. Greece is a member of the eurozone. There\u2019s no doubt about that. Whether with the euro or temporarily without it: only the Greeks can answer this question. When he made those remarks, Sch\u00e4uble probably hadn\u2019t heard that Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, thinks the country\u2019s creditors are trying to \u201cterrorize\u201d Greece. Varoufakis said Greece\u2019s creditors wanted to \u201cinstil fear\u201d and blamed them for the government having to close the banks. What they\u2019re doing with Greece has a name -- terrorism. What Brussels and the troika want today is for the yes (vote) to win so they could humiliate the Greeks. We will be looking forward to the next eurozone finance ministers meeting if Varoufakis does stay in office - he has promised to resign in the event of a yes vote. Matteo Renzi reiterated his message of reassurance that Italy will not be following in Greece\u2019s footsteps. The Italian prime minister said Italy was no longer the sick man of Europe. Around 1,000 people gathered in London urging the cancellation of Greece\u2019s debts. Similar rallies took place in other UK cities, following demonstrations in Brussels, Rome and Paris earlier this week. That\u2019s all from me. The Guardian live blog team will be back tomorrow to guide you through polling day and beyond. Thank you for following and commenting. One of the most influential architects of the European Union has called on its current leaders to do everything they can to rescue Greece, including looking at its debt burden \u201cwithout delay\u201d. Jacques Delors, who was responsible for deepening European integration when he was president of the Commission from 1985-93, called on the EU to adopt a three-part rescue plan for Greece. Writing in Le Monde, he writes that Greece needs (1) financial aid to restore it to short-term solvency (2) help via EU programmes so it can return to economic growth and (3) \u201cwithout delay examination of the weight of Greek debt\u201d, as well as the debts of other countries that have been under EU bailout programmes. The Greek drama is not solely national: it will have effects on all of Europe. But he has a stern message for the Greek authorities An exit from the current crisis means a change in view from Greece... it requires the expression of a clear will to break with the last forty years. The article is co-signed by Pascal Lamy, former head of the World Trade Organisation and European commissioner, and Antonio Vitorino , president of the Jacques Delors Institute. Are we getting smoke signals from the European Commission? The most senior advisor to Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the Commission, has been assiduously tweeting his boss\u2019s thoughts on the Greek government this afternoon. Martin Selmayr is Juncker\u2019s head of cabinet. He recently got into hot water with the German finance ministry when he tweeted that a new Greek proposal was a good basis for progress. He has been busy on Twitter again. For instance... It turns out the Der Spiegel interview is more than two weeks old. So why the volley of tweets the day before the Greek vote? Is it a response to European Council president Donald Tusk\u2019s statement that voting no doesn\u2019t have to mean leaving the euro? Or German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s softer tone that leaving the euro could be temporary. Juncker once had relatively good relations with Greece\u2019s hard-left government. But he has fallen out with Alexis Tsipras. He feels personally betrayed and said a few days ago that \u201cno would mean that Greece is saying no to Europe\u201d. These tweets could be seen as a subtle way to reinforce that message. The division in Greece over Sunday\u2019s referendum is reflected in the country\u2019s newspapers, which are split between yes and no. First, some context from Sophia Ignatidou of The Week. She writes that \u201cmost mainstream media outlets in Greece have close ties to political parties or business magnates, so their coverage is often viewed with a healthy degree of scepticism\u201d. A number of papers are affiliated to Syriza or the Communist party, so their support for no is not surprising, she says. Ethnos is calling on its readers to vote yes. \u201cGreeks choose Europe\u201d reads the front page of the Sunday edition of Ethnos, printed on the background of a photo of Greek and European Union flags. (The referendum means that Sunday papers are ready for Saturday). Proto Thema, Greece\u2019s biggest selling weekly, is also calling for yes. No means immediate deposit haircut, banks and ATMs closed, rationing of food, medicine and gas, and, in the end, drachma and national tragedy. Avgi, a newspaper affiliated to Syriza, followed the line of prime minister Alexis Tsipras that a no vote would be \u201cthe catalyst for a new deal\u201d. The referendum is the way through which the people take an active role in the negotiations, regardless of whether they choose yes or no. Rizospastis, linked to the Communist party, echoed the language of Tsipras and Varoufakis, by calling on \u201cpeople to turn their back to the blackmail and the terrorising dilemmas posed by the referendum\u201d. Sources: Bloomberg and The Week. Greece solidarity rallies are now underway in London and Dublin. Italy\u2019s prime minister Matteo Renzi has said his country is no longer a \u201ccompanion in misfortune\u201d of debt-ridden Greece, as it was three or four years ago. We need to stop calling Italy the sick man of Europe, because it\u2019s no longer true. Speaking on Italian television Renzi said Italy was no longer afraid of the consequences of Greece\u2019s financial troubles - unlike during the 2011 crisis when fears were high of contagion spreading from the Greek crisis to many other heavily-indebted European nations. Reforms undertaken in Italy have shown that \u201cwe are on the side of those who seek to resolve the problem\u201d he said. Spillover from the Greek debt crisis is no longer such a big fear for Italy, Spain and Portugal. But the threat hasn\u2019t entirely gone away. The cost of borrowing jumped in all three countries when talks between Greece and the eurozone went into meltdown on Monday. However markets soon stabilised: borrowing costs for Italy, Spain and Portugal steadied at less than half levels seen three years ago. With the European Central Bank standing ready to intervene, Renzi\u2019s confidence is well-founded. Quotes via AFP Only war or the great depression of the 1930s has proved more destructive than Greece\u2019s debt crisis and austerity years. This graph brings home the scale of Greece\u2019s economic collapse. The number crunchers at RBS also show how poorly Greece has fared compared to its southern European neighbours. Greece faces more instability and could see a rise in political extremism, no matter what the outcome of Sunday\u2019s referendum. That is the verdict of the Economist Intelligence Unit, which forecasts a victory for the no side. The sober research organisation paints a picture of growing social strain and political division. Joan Hoey, regional editor of the EIU, says Greece is heading for tumultuous times. The EIU forecasts victory for the no camp, but whatever the outcome of the referendum, the stark divisions exposed by the referendum campaign are no basis for a future stable political equilibrium. This, as well as intransigence by Greece\u2019s creditors, will make it difficult to reach a viable agreement on a future financing programme. Greece today is angry and fearful, divided and conflicted, and will still be after Sunday\u2019s vote. This means that Greece is headed for an even more tumultuous period ahead. With Greek society under immense strain and political divisions becoming sharper, the potential for political extremism will increase. The analysis, released on Saturday, chimes with a recent article by the historian Mark Mazower. In the New York Times on Wednesday he wrote: Thanks to this ill-advised plebiscite, Greece faces major turmoil that will test the democratic institutions it established after 1974. The country doesn\u2019t need a return to the worst excesses of student politics. Still less does it need the overheated rhetoric of violent struggle, national disaster and civil war that is already in the air. The full article - Don\u2019t Bet on Syriza - is very interesting on the activist culture that shaped the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras. Provocative and well worth reading if you haven\u2019t already. Greek banks were quick to deny rumours that they were going to seize a tranche of savers\u2019 deposits - aka a \u201chaircut\u201d in financial slang. Greek people have been no less quick to respond. It is not only Greeks who have been taking to the streets. Rallies in support of Greece are due to get underway across the UK, in London, Liverpool and Edinburgh. Solidarity marches - supporting a Greek no vote - have taken place in cities across Europe. This was the scene in Brussels on Friday night. In the Belgian capital, police clashed with young people ahead of the march. Anti-austerity demonstrators in Paris on Thursday expressed their solidarity with the Greek people. And in Rome... In an earlier entry, I posted this photograph that sums up how deeply sad the debt crisis is for ordinary Greek people. We now know more about the man, who is pensioner Giorgos Chatzifotiadis. From the AFP news agency: Giorgos Chatzifotiadis had queued up at three banks in Greece\u2019s second city of Thessaloniki on Friday in the hope of withdrawing a pension on behalf of his wife, but all in vain. When he was told at the fourth that he could not withdraw his \u20ac120 (\u00a386, $133), it was all too much and he collapsed in tears. The 77-year-old told AFP that he had broken down because he \u201ccannot stand to see my country in this distress\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s why I feel so beaten, more than for my own personal problems,\u201d Chatzifotiadis said. The image of him sitting outside the bank, openly crying in despair with his savings book and identity card on the floor, was captured by an AFP photographer illustrating how ordinary Greeks are suffering during the country\u2019s debt crisis. Recounting how he had gone from bank to bank in a futile attempt to collect his wife\u2019s pension, Chatzifotiadis said when he was told at the fourth \u201cthat I could not get the money, I just collapsed\u201d. Both he and his wife, like many Greeks in the north of the country, had spent several years in Germany where he \u201cworked very hard\u201d in a coal mine and later a foundry. But Chatzifotiadis feels he can do little to change the situation, and he is not even sure if he would be able to vote at Sunday\u2019s referendum on whether to accept international creditors\u2019 bailout conditions. European leaders have warned that a \u2018No\u2019 vote would also mean no to the eurozone. Pointing out that the polling station is 80 kilometres (50 miles) away, Chatzifotiadis said: \u201cI have no money to go there, unless perhaps if my children would take me in their car.\u201d The banks may be running out of money, but Greece is not short of creativity. Greece\u2019s five-year debt crisis has created a thriving anti-austerity art movement. Jon Henley has been speaking to some of the artists. Former photographer Cacao \u2013 responsible for works including \u201c\u20acurope without Greece is like a party without drugs\u201d, \u201cCut the Debt\u201d, \u201cIMF Go Home\u201d, and the now infamous \u201cThen they used tanks. Now they use banks\u201d \u2013 said Greece\u2019s long-flourishing street art scene had exploded since the crisis began. \u201cPartly it was because of this big wave of anger that started in 2008 and just grew and grew,\u201d he said. \u201cBut also, as the crisis got worse, there were more and more closed shops and empty buildings. There were a lot of walls to paint.\u201d You can read the full article here. Spotted... The Guardian\u2019s Southern Europe editor John Hooper visited the yes rally on Friday night and sent us this report. The \u2018yes\u2019 campaign managed to get up an altogether more rumbustious \u2013 and better-attended \u2013 demonstration than the one on Tuesday in Syntagma Square, which was marred by rain. Supporters of an agreement turned the centre of the open-air \u2013 and open-ended - Panathenaic Stadium in central Athens into a sea of Greek flags dotted with some EU ones. They also spilled out for about 50 yards down the avenue that runs across the stadium\u2019s open side. Toting a big EU flag, Dimitris Tsaoussis, a financial analyst, said he was there to \u201ctell my European family that we belong in Europe and we will stay in Europe\u201d. Zacharias Sachinis, a marketing manager with a chemicals firms, who was at the rally with his wife and son, said he was going to vote \u201cyes\u201d on Sunday because \u201cthe euro is good for Greece\u201d, even though he didn\u2019t like \u201cthe dictatorship of Schauble.\u201d As on Tuesday, the atmosphere was good-natured. But below the surface calm there is deep concern \u2013 and some trepidation. With the approach of the referendum, growing numbers of Greeks are becoming reluctant to give their names to reporters. \u201cI came because we can\u2019t be indifferent,\u201d said one young woman emphatically. But she balked at identifying herself. So did her friend, who said: \u201cWe can\u2019t predict the consequences of anything. That\u2019s why we\u2019re nervous.\u201d Here is some footage from the no rally on Syntagma square on Friday night. One voter summed up her hopes: I hope the no [vote] is so powerful that we can see better days, because if people say yes they will be condemned. Police using stun grenades to disperse the crowds, after scuffles between protesters and police broke out shortly before the rally got underway. Germany\u2019s finance minister has said there will be no quick deal with Athens after Sunday\u2019s referendum. In an interview with top-selling tabloid Bild, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble forecast difficult talks, although he promised that the Greek people would not be left in the lurch. Greece is a member of the eurozone. There\u2019s no doubt about that. Whether with the euro or temporarily without it*: only the Greeks can answer this question. And it is clear that we will not leave the people in the lurch. He also said that the risks of the crisis spreading to other European countries were limited. Even if it came to a collapse of some individual banks, the risk of contagion is relatively small. The markets have reacted with restraint in the last few days. That shows that the problem is manageable. Any talks with Greece on an aid-for-reforms deal would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d after Sunday\u2019s vote, Sch\u00e4uble said, but he predicted that in a year\u2019s time, Europe would be stronger than it was before the Greek crisis. Bild has long been sceptical about bailouts for Greece. In the tabloid\u2019s online poll, 89% said they opposed giving Greece further aid. * Sch\u00e4uble spoke of a temporary exit from the eurozone, which sounds (to this blogger at least) like a softening of Germany\u2019s position that Greece would have to leave the single currency. The full interview (in German) is here, I\u2019ve taken translated quotes from Reuters. The Guardian\u2019s Jon Henley takes the temperature at Athens airport. Greece\u2019s finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has compared the action of his country\u2019s European creditors to terrorism. Never one to fear giving offence, the outspoken minister told El Mundo that the country\u2019s lenders were trying to instil fear. What they\u2019re doing with Greece has a name -- terrorism. What Brussels and the troika want today is for the yes (vote) to win so they could humiliate the Greeks. Why did they force us to close the banks? To instil fear in people. And spreading fear is called terrorism. The troika refers to the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission. It is interesting that Varoufakis used the word. When Syriza came to power they pledged to expel the troika from Greece, but only succeeded in changing the name - to \u201cthe institutions\u201d. Varoufakis also said he was sure of reaching an agreement with Greece\u2019s creditors if the country votes no. Because there\u2019s too much at stake, as much for Greece as for Europe, I\u2019m sure. If Greece crashes, a trillion euros - the equivalent of Spain\u2019s GDP - will be lost. It\u2019s too much money and I don\u2019t believe Europe could allow it. The full interview in Spanish is here, but I\u2019ve relied on translation from The Local. Greek authorities have move swiftly to deny a report that banks are planning to raid depositors\u2019 funds to prevent the financial system from collapsing. The Financial Times (\u00a3) reported that banks were preparing contingency plans to seize at least 30% of deposits holding more than \u20ac8,000. The head of Greece\u2019s Bank Association dismissed the report as \u201ccompletely baseless.\u201d Louka Katseli, who also chairs the National Bank of Greece, told Skai TV that suggestions that authorities were planning a raid on deposits belonged \u201conly in the sphere of fantasy.\u201d There are no such scenarios at any Greek bank, not even as an exercise on paper. Rebuttals courtesy of Kathimerini Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek debt crisis. Greece is on the brink of one of its most important votes since returning to democracy more than 40 years ago. In less than 24 hours the polls will open on what will be a decisive day for Greece and Europe. The vote will go ahead, after, as expected, Greece\u2019s highest administrative court rejected an appeal to stop the vote. Greeks are being asked to vote on a bailout deal that would mean more austerity and reform in exchange for desperately-needed cash. One Greek woman told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, it was like being asked to choose between sudden death or a slow death. At a packed rally in Athens on Friday night, the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras said a no vote would enable him to negotiate a reform-for-debt-relief deal with the country\u2019s creditors. That is at odds with many European leaders, who have said Greece will leave the euro if it votes no. But this hardline consensus is showing signs of cracking. Donald Tusk, the head of the European Council, said Greece could stay in the eurozone even if it voted no. In an interview published on Friday night in Politico, he said: It\u2019s very clear that the referendum is not \u2026 about being in the eurozone or not. No, in fact, nobody\u2019s interested \u2014 I hope nobody\u2019s interested \u2014 in this kind of choice. Maybe we will have to get used to living with a country as a member of the eurozone in bankruptcy. Meanwhile Greek banks have been forced to deny a report that they plan to raid the deposits of savers to stave off imminent collapse. More later. But Greece is almost out of cash, as the Guardian\u2019s team reports: Greece\u2019s economy is on the brink of collapse after the capital controls imposed ahead of Sunday\u2019s referendum left the country with shortages of food and drugs, the tourist industry facing a wave of cancellations and banks with barely enough money to survive the weekend. Banks said they had a \u20ac1bn cash buffer to see them through the weekend \u2013 equal to just \u20ac90 (\u00a364) a head for the 11 million-strong population \u2013 and would require immediate help from the European Central Bank on Monday whatever the result of the referendum, in which the two sides are running neck and neck. Greek economy close to collapse as food and medicine run short After a dramatic week, we are expecting a quieter day today. But as the Greek debt crisis has proved, never say never...",

      "bodyText": "Peterlee, near Sunderland, was once a mining town. Now, it\u2019s home to a vast, hi-tech manufacturing plant for US truck-maker Caterpillar. In every direction, blue-overalled workers clamber over the massive yellow vehicles, whose tyres are taller than a man, brandishing drills or lowering giant parts meticulously into place from ceiling-mounted hoists. Chris Fairs, the human resources manager, explains that his staff manufacture almost every part of the vehicles here: rolled steel comes in, giant trucks roll out, in what they call a \u201cplate to gate\u201d process. Many of the workers are former miners, or welders from the defunct Sunderland shipyards. \u201cThis is a world-class manufacturing facility,\u201d he says. When times were hard during the downturn, amicable relations with trades unions allowed Caterpillar to negotiate a sharp cut to working hours to save jobs. Now capacity has expanded, and the workforce is back to pre-crisis levels. When the company advertised for five apprentices this year, it got 1,500 applications. Caterpillar is a lean, shiny, success story with a well-trained workforce \u2013 precisely the kind of firm George Osborne hopes to boost with his plan to build a \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, which he will flesh out in Wednesday\u2019s budget. Other firms nearby are thriving: Hitachi is building a train plant at Newton Aycliffe; BAE Systems and Siemens have operations here, too, building on the north-east\u2019s tradition of engineering skills. Ross Smith, director of policy at the North-East Chamber of Commerce, says: \u201cIf you look at the point where austerity started and if you look at how well the economy in the north-east has done, it is a testament to how well businesses have performed.\u201d But it\u2019s far from clear what Osborne\u2019s northern powerhouse project, fronted by newly minted Mancunian minister Lord (Jim) O\u2019Neill, means here. Officially launching the scheme in a warehouse in Manchester in May, Osborne promised that it would mark \u201ca revolution in the way we govern England\u201d and close the \u201cdecades-old economic gap between north and south\u201d. \u201cWithin 40 miles of Manchester, you have Leeds, Sheffield and Liverpool, Lancashire, Cheshire and Yorkshire \u2013 a belt of cities and towns that contains 10 million people \u2013 more than Tokyo, New York or London. Bring those cities together, connect Liverpool to Hull, the north-west to Yorkshire and the north-east \u2013 and the whole will be greater than the parts,\u201d he said. Manchester has been given sweeping powers over everything from transport to health policy, under a deal known as \u201cDevo Manc\u201d. While that approach may work well for Manchester, which constitutes a coherent \u201ccity region\u201d, deep-seated rivalries between Newcastle and Sunderland could make it hard to impose such a pattern there \u2013 and indeed Newcastle voted against the idea of an elected mayor in a referendum called by the coalition government in 2012. Simon Henig, Labour leader of Durham county council and vice-chair of the Association of North-East Councils, says: \u201cWe are in the early stages of talking about what a northern powerhouse might mean. It has to move beyond Greater Manchester if we are to move beyond rhetoric \u2026 Greater Manchester is 100 miles from the north-east.\u201d Ed Cox, director of thinktank IPPR North, agrees, and says if the chancellor is to make a genuine difference to Britain\u2019s north-south divide he will need to put up some money. \u201cThe northern powerhouse has been a great concept and absolutely galvanised local politicians, businesses and government,\u201d he says \u2013 but then he points to the recent announcement by the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, that a series of key rail projects, including the electrification of the TransPennine route between Manchester and Leeds, as well as the Midland mainline from London to Sheffield, will be \u201cpaused\u201d. Cox hopes the budget will be a chance to correct course, \u201cwith a significant funding commitment on transport particularly and infrastructure more generally\u201d. There does appear to be growing confidence among local authority leaders that the government will keep its word on devolution \u2013 not just for a northern powerhouse but across England. A report by consultants PwC last week found about 20% of English local authorities expect to become part of a new combined authority, governed by an elected mayor, by 2020. This is up significantly from 12% before the election. But PwC warns there is much more to delivering the benefits of decentralisation than elected mayors. Too much focus on governance could come at the expense of delivering actual results in terms of skills, transport and growth, says Jonathan House, government and public sector partner at PwC. \u201cDecentralisation cannot be an end in itself.\u201d Smith at the North-East Chamber of Commerce believes that if the northern powerhouse means beefing up local powers over training and skills, that could be helpful in a region where skills shortages are the subject of constant complaint from employers \u2013 particularly in engineering, and in the region\u2019s rapidly growing IT sector. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt for our members that their top concern right now is getting people with the right skills to meet the requirements in their workforce,\u201d says Smith, whose chamber represents around 4,000 businesses. \u201cIt would also provide a bit more flexibility in the way funding is used. For example, it can be difficult to get funding to train older people in the workforce \u2013 and by that I don\u2019t mean people over 55, I mean people over 24.\u201d For a region that has been shedding experienced workers from a shrinking public sector, such adult training is vital. \u201cThere are good people coming out of the public sector, but they might not have the right skills for specific businesses, so it comes back to training,\u201d adds Smith. And there\u2019s a much deeper worry about whether the Conservatives can expunge the legacy of decades of deindustrialisation: this is a government that has already presided over five years of austerity, and Osborne is about to announce a fresh round of cuts. There is growing concern about whether private sector success stories like Caterpillar can offset the spending squeeze. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, says: \u201cThe chancellor is effectively pulling the plug on his grand project even before it has begun. As well as shelving much-needed upgrades for the TransPennine and Midland mainline routes, which would have boosted jobs and growth in the north, his new round of austerity cuts will set existing regional inequalities in stone. A more apt name for his plan would be \u2018northern poorhouse\u2019.\u201d The TUC\u2019s research suggests that between 2010 and 2014 London created jobs at four times the pace of the north-east. Henig, who was meeting fellow council leaders from up and down the country at the Local Government Association in Harrogate last week, says they are focused as much on the autumn spending review, when the chancellor will spell out the fine details of his cuts programme, as this week\u2019s budget. \u201cOur ability to generate resources is lower than in other parts of the country,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t turn to hiking up fees. So we can\u2019t rake in millions from car park fees or whatever because there isn\u2019t enough wealth in the area to stand it.\u201d The latest employment numbers, released in June, showed that the north-east created a net 17,000 jobs over the year. But unemployment stood at 95,000, or 7.4%, well above the 5.5% national average and the highest for any region by some margin. A group of local union reps, gathered in Newcastle to share their experiences of the past five years, chuckle at the phrase \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d. They tell a sorry tale of cutbacks and layoffs, and the insecurity of short-term contracts and limited working hours. They also talk of charities, activists and public-spirited citizens stepping in where the state has withdrawn. Food banks have been joined by clothes banks, which help parents who cannot afford to clothe their children; teachers are bringing in breakfast for underfed pupils. Nicky Ramanandi, deputy regional convenor of Unison, says: \u201cWe have seen a real attack on the core services that provide economic and human growth: Sure Start centres; domestic abuse services. I\u2019m very, very worried about what the budget will bring.\u201d Fran Heathcote, president of the Department for Work and Pensions branch of the PCS civil service union, many of whose members will implement the \u00a312bn of welfare cuts George Osborne has promised to spell out on Wednesday, says it is ironic that 40% of the staff she represents are in receipt of in-work benefits, such as tax credits, to top up their take-home pay \u2013 the very payments expected to be top of the chancellor\u2019s hit list. Cox, of IPPR North, says: \u201cThe black cloud on the horizon is the spending review, because all of this talk of devolution and targeted investment and so on will all bring the long-term gains. In the short term, if you see a spending review that is devastating for local services, the social disruption that could cause will, in my opinion, outweigh the benefits that we will accrue with devolution.\u201d This article has been ammended.

This article was amended on 16 July 2015 to correctly identify the coalition government as the instigators of a referendum on the idea of an elected mayor in Newcastle in 2012 \u2013 not a Labour government.",

Ross Smith, director of policy at the North-East Chamber of Commerce, says: \u201cIf you look at the point where austerity started and if you look at how well the economy in the north-east has done, it is a testament to how well businesses have performed.\u201d</p> <p>But it\u2019s far from clear what Osborne\u2019s northern powerhouse project, fronted by newly minted Mancunian minister Lord (Jim) O\u2019Neill, means here. Officially launching the scheme in a warehouse in Manchester in May, Osborne promised that it would mark <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-on-building-a-northern-powerhouse\">\u201ca revolution in the way we govern England\u201d </a> and close the \u201cdecades-old economic gap between north and south\u201d. \u201cWithin 40 miles of Manchester, you have Leeds, Sheffield and Liverpool, Lancashire, Cheshire and Yorkshire \u2013 a belt of cities and towns that contains 10 million people \u2013 more than Tokyo, New York or London. Bring those cities together, connect Liverpool to Hull, the north-west to Yorkshire and the north-east \u2013 and the whole will be greater than the parts,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Manchester has been given sweeping powers over everything from transport to health policy, under a deal known as \u201cDevo Manc\u201d. While that approach may work well for Manchester, which constitutes a coherent \u201ccity region\u201d, deep-seated rivalries between Newcastle and Sunderland could make it hard to impose such a pattern there \u2013 and indeed Newcastle voted against the idea of an elected mayor in a referendum called by the coalition government in 2012.</p> <p>Simon Henig, Labour leader of Durham county council and vice-chair of the Association of North-East Councils, says: \u201cWe are in the early stages of talking about what a northern powerhouse might mean. It has to move beyond Greater Manchester if we are to move beyond rhetoric \u2026 Greater Manchester is 100 miles from the north-east.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"feab70a99ba52c10d215758323091a4ce70ad5e6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435948108107/9054bebc-9e02-469e-9cb7-b967b05c4ecb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Caterpillar factory in Peterlee.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Caterpillar factory in Peterlee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Pinder for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ed Cox, director of thinktank IPPR North, agrees, and says if the chancellor is to make a genuine difference to Britain\u2019s north-south divide he will need to put up some money.</p> <p>\u201cThe northern powerhouse has been a great concept and absolutely galvanised local politicians, businesses and government,\u201d he says \u2013 but then he points to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/25/network-rail-chief-to-step-down-as-385bn-upgrades-are-delayed\">recent announcement </a>by the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, that a series of key rail projects, including the electrification of the TransPennine route between Manchester and Leeds, as well as the Midland mainline from London to Sheffield, will be \u201cpaused\u201d.</p> <p>Cox hopes the budget will be a chance to correct course, \u201cwith a significant funding commitment on transport particularly and infrastructure more generally\u201d. There does appear to be growing confidence among local authority leaders that the government will keep its word on devolution \u2013 not just for a northern powerhouse but across England.</p> <p>A report by consultants PwC last week found about 20% of English local authorities expect to become part of a new combined authority, governed by an elected mayor, by 2020. This is up significantly from 12% before the election.</p> <p>But PwC warns there is much more to delivering the benefits of decentralisation than elected mayors. Too much focus on governance could come at the expense of delivering actual results in terms of skills, transport and growth, says Jonathan House, government and public sector partner at PwC. \u201cDecentralisation cannot be an end in itself.\u201d</p> <p>Smith at the North-East Chamber of Commerce believes that if the northern powerhouse means beefing up local powers over training and skills, that could be helpful in a region where skills shortages are the subject of constant complaint from employers \u2013 particularly in engineering, and in the region\u2019s rapidly growing IT sector.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt for our members that their top concern right now is getting people with the right skills to meet the requirements in their workforce,\u201d says Smith, whose chamber represents around 4,000 businesses.</p> <p>\u201cIt would also provide a bit more flexibility in the way funding is used. For example, it can be difficult to get funding to train older people in the workforce \u2013 and by that I don\u2019t mean people over 55, I mean people over 24.\u201d</p> <p>For a region that has been shedding experienced workers from a shrinking public sector, such adult training is vital. \u201cThere are good people coming out of the public sector, but they might not have the right skills for specific businesses, so it comes back to training,\u201d adds Smith.</p> <p>And there\u2019s a much deeper worry about whether the Conservatives can expunge the legacy of decades of deindustrialisation: this is a government that has already presided over five years of austerity, and Osborne is about to announce a fresh round of cuts. There is growing concern about whether private sector success stories like Caterpillar can offset the spending squeeze.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f90b3c249e0219cf28d40cad9134919e30872e0\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435948267553/7b93844f-2d08-4ed8-b1b0-cd8cd1598fd9-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"George Osborne will flesh out his northern powerhouse plans in Wednesday's budget.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Osborne will flesh out his northern powerhouse plans in Wednesday\u2019s budget.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, says: \u201cThe chancellor is effectively pulling the plug on his grand project even before it has begun. As well as shelving much-needed upgrades for the TransPennine and Midland mainline routes, which would have boosted jobs and growth in the north, his new round of austerity cuts will set existing regional inequalities in stone. A more apt name for his plan would be \u2018northern poorhouse\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The TUC\u2019s research suggests that between 2010 and 2014 London created jobs at four times the pace of the north-east. Henig, who was meeting fellow council leaders from up and down the country at the Local Government Association in Harrogate last week, says they are focused as much on the autumn spending review, when the chancellor will spell out the fine details of his cuts programme, as this week\u2019s budget. \u201cOur ability to generate resources is lower than in other parts of the country,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t turn to hiking up fees. So we can\u2019t rake in millions from car park fees or whatever because there isn\u2019t enough wealth in the area to stand it.\u201d</p> <p>The latest employment numbers, released in June, showed that the north-east created a net 17,000 jobs over the year. But unemployment stood at 95,000, or 7.4%, well above the 5.5% national average and the highest for any region by some margin.</p> <p>A group of local union reps, gathered in Newcastle to share their experiences of the past five years, chuckle at the phrase \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d. They tell a sorry tale of cutbacks and layoffs, and the insecurity of short-term contracts and limited working hours. They also talk of charities, activists and public-spirited citizens stepping in where the state has withdrawn. Food banks have been joined by clothes banks, which help parents who cannot afford to clothe their children; teachers are bringing in breakfast for underfed pupils.</p> <p>Nicky Ramanandi, deputy regional convenor of Unison, says: \u201cWe have seen a real attack on the core services that provide economic and human growth: Sure Start centres; domestic abuse services. I\u2019m very, very worried about what the budget will bring.\u201d</p> <p>Fran Heathcote, president of the Department for Work and Pensions branch of the PCS civil service union, many of whose members will implement the \u00a312bn of welfare cuts George Osborne has promised to spell out on Wednesday, says it is ironic that 40% of the staff she represents are in receipt of in-work benefits, such as tax credits, to top up their take-home pay \u2013 the very payments expected to be top of the chancellor\u2019s hit list.</p> <p>Cox, of IPPR North, says: \u201cThe black cloud on the horizon is the spending review, because all of this talk of devolution and targeted investment and so on will all bring the long-term gains. In the short term, if you see a spending review that is devastating for local services, the social disruption that could cause will, in my opinion, outweigh the benefits that we will accrue with devolution.\u201d</p> <p>This article has been ammended.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As Americans fire up their barbecues for Independence Day and Britons swelter in record-breaking heat, people on both sides of the Atlantic may be reaching for their ice boxes. In 2014, an unassuming-looking cooler shattered records on crowdfunding site Kickstarter, raking in more than $13m from backers. The Coolest Cooler, which features a blender, a USB charger and outdoor Bluetooth speaker, wildly exceeded its modest $50,000 funding goal, leaving its inventor in an unusual position \u2013 a small business with millions of dollars at its disposal, virtually overnight. Kickstarter has given individual entrepreneurs and small companies a chance to bring their creations to light. According to the site, 38% of projects meet or exceed their goal. But for those, like the Cooler, which make millions of dollars more than planned, the extra funds and sudden exposure can pose unexpected hurdles. \u201cWe had to rethink the scale of production and that was a big challenge,\u201d said Ryan Grepper, inventor of the Coolest Cooler. \u201cThe sheer volume meant that we had to look at every aspect and find partners who could help us manufacture the quantity we needed and meet the continuing demand.\u201d This wasn\u2019t Grepper\u2019s first try with the Coolest Cooler. In November 2013, he launched a Kickstarter campaign for an earlier version of the product with a funding goal of $125,000. That bid failed, however, making only $100,000. If a project doesn\u2019t meet its funding goal, the inventor gets nothing, as per Kickstarter\u2019s policy. Gepper decided to try again less than a year later, in July 2014. He improved the design and launched the campaign in the summer, which in hindsight seemed obvious for a quintessentially outdoor product, he said. This time around, he reached his goal in 24 hours, and raised $1m in the first two days. By the end of the campaign, 52 days later, he had raised more than $13.2m from 62,000 backers, making it, at the time, the most successful project in Kickstarter\u2019s five-year history. But the immediate success of the campaign meant that Grepper had to funnel much of the additional funding back into production to satisfy his new backers. When a project does exceed its goal, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean extra funds, said Kickstarter spokesperson David Gallagher. \u201cA project\u2019s goal is often the minimum amount needed to get it off the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cIf creators get more backers than they expected, they\u2019ll probably need to make more of those rewards.\u201d But exceeding campaign goals can also give inventors added flexibility when it comes to designing and crafting their products. Sometimes creators use the money to enhance their product, like adding more songs to an album, or using better materials, Gallagher said. Rather than adding new features, Grepper and his team chose to instead refine and upgrade existing elements, such as making stronger wheels and improving the hinges on the cooler. Other companies run multiple campaigns to ensure that backers are justly rewarded, and that the product lives up to expectations. The 3Doodler, which calls itself the \u201cworld\u2019s first 3D printing pen\u201d \u2013 allowing users to draw in 3D \u2013 had a goal of $30,000 when it launched on Kickstarter in February 2013. It ended up raising $2.3m (later, they ran a second project to give their initial backers the first chance to get the new version of the pen, and raised $1.5m). \u201cWe could fulfill our vision in making the 3Doodler a reality, our way,\u201d said Maxwell Bogue, cofounder of Wobbleworks, the Boston-based company behind the pen. \u201c[That\u2019s] a very rare thing.\u201d They were also able to make a better product, he said, by spending more money on components that would otherwise have been out of reach, as well as taking suggestions from backers about what they wanted to see added, like a plug port that allows a user to control the 3Doodler from an external device. Bogue said his company had prepared for every scenario prior to the campaign. For example, they had found manufacturing partners who were willing to make a few thousand units, but who were also capable of scaling up into the hundreds of thousands if necessary. \u201cWe had to expand and create a functional company in a matter of days,\u201d he said. \u201cSince we had done so much planning it made the process bearable.\u201d Sometimes this means delays in getting a product to backers. The first shipment of the Coolest Cooler had to be pushed back from February to July. The company has received more than 62,000 orders from Kickstarter backers and is on track to start shipping those this month, Grepper said, adding that it also has a waiting list of more than 200,000 orders. \u201cAfter we closed our record setting Kickstarter, we realized we\u2019d need more time to execute at the level we felt our backers deserved,\u201d he said. \u201cOur backers showed they overwhelmingly shared our values and agreed with our plan to take a little more time to get it exactly right.\u201d Being in the spotlight put added pressure on Grepper, but it also may ultimately result in a better product. \u201cIt certainly would be easier to develop a product like this in a less a public way, but it sure does keep you focused,\u201d he said. \u201cWith success came high expectations, but I don\u2019t think of the challenges that have arisen as a curse \u2013 just obstacles to overcome.\u201d This article was amended 5 July. A previous version said the company was on track to ship 180,000. In fact, it is on track to start shipping this month, but isn\u2019t yet ready to fill all of the 62,000 orders from Kickstarter backers due to manufacturing constraints.",

Why did they force us to close the banks? To instil fear in people. And spreading fear is called terrorism.\u201d The escalation of his rhetoric comes as Greece prepares to vote on Sunday in the referendum that could decide the country\u2019s continued membership of the eurozone. The Greek economy is on the brink of collapse after the capital controls imposed before the referendum left the country with shortages of food and drugs, the tourist industry facing a wave of cancellations and banks with barely enough money to survive the weekend. Holding political rallies and publishing new opinion polls are banned 24 hours before the vote, the result of which remains too close to call. Polls have narrowed in recent days after warnings from the European commission and Greece\u2019s eurozone partners that a no vote would lead to Greece\u2019s ejection from the single currency. A GPO poll put the yes voters on 44.1% and no on 43.7%, while an Alco survey found 44.5% would vote yes, with 43.9% intending to vote no. Many voters have switched to the yes camp since capital controls were imposed this week limiting daily cash machine withdrawals to just \u20ac60. Greeks queued once again on Saturday morning to make withdrawals as fears mounted about the state of the country\u2019s economy. Banks said they had a \u20ac1bn cash buffer to see them through the weekend \u2013 equal to just \u20ac90 (\u00a364) a head for Greece\u2019s 11 million people. However, they will need immediate help from the European Central Bank on Monday whatever the result of the referendum. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, was given a rapturous reception at a rally in Syntagma Square on Friday night, but the survival of his Syriza-led government is in doubt if Greeks vote yes. Political analyst George Sefertzis said: \u201cA no win would be a Pyrrhic victory for the Greek government. You can\u2019t survive on Pyrrhic victories because you need funds to keep the country running.\u201d Varoufakis, who has promised to resign if Greeks vote yes on Sunday, also denied a Financial Times report suggesting that Greek savers could lose 30% of any savings above \u20ac8,000. Such a move would be intended to shore up the country\u2019s banking system. It would be similar to what happened in Cyprus in 2013, when savers with more than \u20ac100,000 in uninsured accounts had a \u201chaircut\u201d imposed. Louka Katseli, the head of Greece\u2019s banking association, said the report was completely baseless and that the idea belonged \u201conly in the sphere of fantasy\u201d. Varoufakis has said that banks will reopen on Tuesday if a new deal is agreed quickly. However, some doubt that will be possible. Lena Antoniou, who is 35 and has two children, said: \u201cI\u2019ve heard shops are running out of flour, sugar and salt. I\u2019m really worried \u2013 how will we manage if we can\u2019t get to our money and there\u2019s no food to buy?\u201d Pensioners, many of whom do not have debit cards, have been hit particularly hard by the bank closures. They have been allowed to make just one over-the-counter withdrawal of \u20ac120 this week. Meanwhile, a senior EU official has told the Guardian that debt relief was not on the table during negotiations to extend Greece\u2019s existing bailout programme because it was \u201cpolitically highly toxic for many eurozone member states\u201d. However, the EU official believes that the debate over debt relief was irrelevant because creditors need assurances that Greece did not want to provide.",
