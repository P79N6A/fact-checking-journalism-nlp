      "bodyText": "Over in Greece, and signs that prime minister Antonis Samaras may not be out of the running in next month\u2019s election, despite the poll lead held by anti-austerity party Syriza. Helena Smith writes: Opening the four-week campaign, Samaras insisted that crisis-plagued Greece had been pushed into holding the poll after Athens\u2019 300-seat House failed to endorse Stavros Dimas, his candidate for president. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want these elections and they aren\u2019t necessary,\u201d Samaras told the nation\u2019s outgoing head of state Karolos Papoulias. \u201cThey are happening because of party self-interest \u2026 and this struggle will determine whether Greece stays in Europe.\u201d With debt-burdened Greece dependent on international rescue funds, officials said Syriza would \u201cpay a heavy price\u201d for triggering the elections after joining forces with the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn to block Dimas\u2019 election. On the back of popular discontent over grueling austerity \u2013 the price of \u20ac240bn in aid - Syriza has lead polls since European elections in May. But the gap has narrowed since Samaras took the high-risk gamble of bringing forward the presidential election. A Marc survey on Tuesday showed Syriza\u2019s lead had dropped to 3.0 percentage points over Samaras\u2019 New Democracy party after the Greek finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis warned of economic sanctions by the European Central Bank if the anti-austerity party won. Analysts predicted that Samaras, who has better personal ratings than his rival Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras, could win the elections yet. \u201cThe gap has been narrowing, due to the fear factor. The more fear the better for [Samaras\u2019]New Democracy,\u201d said the political science professor Dimitris Kerides. \u201cND is running the government and can manipulate the fear factor in its favor.\u201d On that note it\u2019s time to close up the blog for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. Worries about the outcome of the forthcoming Greek election for the eurozone have sent shares sharply lower as 2014 grinds to a close. A volatile oil price, which saw Brent tumble below $57 a barrel before recovering to its current $57.49, also hit sentiment, with energy companies among the market losers. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 86.51 points or 1.3% lower at 6547.00 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.22% to 9805.55 France\u2019s Cac closed down 1.68% at 4245.54 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 0.62% at 19,011.96 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.11% lower at 10,279.2 The Athens market closed 0.45% down at 816.15 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 43 points or 0.24% at the moment. Back in the corporate world, and the nearly \u00a33bn Qatari-led bid for property group Songbird Estates is hotting up. US fund manager Franklin, which owns 7% of Songbird, is backing the 350p a share offer from the Qatar Investment Authority and its American bidding partner Brookfield Property Partners, according to the final offer document just published. QIA owns 29% of Songbird, which in turn owns 69% of Docklands developer Canary Wharf, but it needs the backing of other key investors including China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and New York investor Simon Glick. Songbird responded to the offer document by repeating that the offer undervalued the company and advised shareholders to take no action until they had received the board\u2019s formal response. In the market Songbird shares are currently down 3.5p at 317p. The rise in consumer confidence has not done much for the US stock market. With Europe heading lower on concerns about the eurozone in the wake of the forthcoming Greek elections, as well as the sliding oil price, American investors are also in a downbeat mood in early trading. (US markets have however been hitting new peaks in recent days, so a dip every now and then is not completely unexpected.) The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 55 points or 0.31% while the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.3%. In Europe the FTSE 100 is 1.4% lowers, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.2% on the last day of trading for the year, while France\u2019s Cac has fallen 1.1%. Over in the US, consumer confidence rose in December, according to the latest Conference Board report, but not by quite as much as expected. The board\u2019s index climbed to 92.6 from 91 in November (itself revised up from 88.7). But this was slightly below forecasts of a level of 93.9. Consumers\u2019 view of current conditions was more favourable in December, with those saying business conditions were good unchanged at 24.8% but those saying they were bad falling form 21.8% to 19.6%. The board\u2019s Lynn Franco said: Consumer confidence rebounded modestly in December, propelled by a considerably more favourable assessment of current economic and labor market conditions. As a result, the Present Situation Index [at 98.6] is now at its highest level since February 2008 (Index, 104.0). Consumers were moderately less optimistic about the short-term outlook in December, but even so, they are more confident at year-end than they were at the beginning of the year. The full report is here: The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index Bounces Back Time for an afternoon summary House price growth has slowed down in almost all parts of the UK, but the gap between London and the rest of the country has widened. Network Rail\u2019s boss, Mark Carne, has given up plans to claim a \u00a333,000 bonus, after delayed engineering works threw the rail system into chaos over Christmas. Italy\u2019s economy minister has said the country has started to grow again. Yields on Italian 10-yr bonds dropped to a record low despite fears of contagion from Greece. The European Commission official in charge of the eurozone has said he respects the \u201cdemocratic choice\u201d of European voters, in response to the announcement that Greece will hold elections in January. US stock markets have opened slightly down on a day of low-volume trading, after the S&amp;P hit a record high on Monday. In Europe markets are even more depressed, after oil prices tumbled to $57.7, a five-and-a half- year low. By mid-afternoon the FTSE100 was down 1.07% to 6,562 points. Germany\u2019s DAX was down 1.22% and France\u2019s CAC was down 0.87%. That\u2019s all from me today. I am now handing over to Nick Fletcher. Thank you for following so far. It had to happen sooner or later. First Tesco created an \u2018indie\u2019 coffee shop; now McDonald\u2019s has opened a hipster cafe. The Corner cafe located in an inner-city Sydney suburb is so far a one-off. Serving pulled pork, chorizo and egg rolls and quinoa salads, it sounds a long way from a milkshakes and a happy meal. Our colleagues in Sydney have been to check it out. While the staff are dressed in chambray shirts and dark jeans \u2013 a far cry from the usual McDonald\u2019s uniform of high pants in surgical green, it still looks like a McDonald\u2019s which is trying not to be a McDonald\u2019s. The hipster touches include tiled walls and a herb garden \u2013 and the food is served on those awfully impractical wooden sandwich boards. What will come next? Green juice in Mason jars? The only McDonald\u2019s branding evident is a tiny \u201cMcCafe\u201d logo in small font on the takeaway bags. The logo is minuscule on the sign outside, which in black lettering on a white background proclaims The Corner.... It could be the only cafe in Sydney\u2019s inner west not to offer macchiatos \u2013 possibly to get around any Mac-squared name \u2013 and there\u2019s the porridge with poached pear to give you and your university-educated friends the extra frisson of some alliteration with your grains-based breakfast. As far as we know the concept hasn\u2019t arrived in Shoreditch, where the hipster breakfast may have already peaked. But it is likely that McDonald\u2019s will take its experiment elsewhere: the company has vowed to correct \u201cmisperceptions\u201d about its food to arrest sinking sales in some of its biggest markets. In uncertain times, buy gold. That mantra seems to have been holding up today. Traders have been buying gold and selling European shares, amid falling oil prices and worries over a renewed flare-up of the eurozone crisis. The spot price of gold has ticked up 1.4% today to $1,200.70 The price of gold soared during the financial crisis, but dropped off sharply on the back of an economic recovery and higher share prices. The latest, modest increase in gold prices is a sign that investors think risks to the global economy have not gone away. Margaret Thatcher was warned that sudden deregulation of the financial sector would give rise to a new culture of \u201cunscrupulous\u201d practices in the City, according to declassified government papers that have been hidden away for 30 years. The Press Association has a good take on the story. Sir Robert Armstrong, the Cabinet secretary, took the unusual step of setting out his personal concerns about \u201cthe things that people think are going on in the City\u201d in a highly prescient memorandum to No 10, PA writes. It continues: 1986 was the year of \u201cBig Bang\u201d - the deregulation of the London Stock Exchange which swept away the old gentlemanly world of \u201cjobbers\u201d and \u201cbrokers\u201d, bringing in electronic trading floors and a wave of foreign incomers armed with sack-loads of cash. It ensured London\u2019s pre-eminence as an international financial centre and ushered in the \u201cloadsamoney\u201d era of conspicuous consumption which characterised the late 1980s as the newly-rich City boys and girls revelled in their wealth. But it was a period also of financial scandals - most notably the Guinness share-rigging affair - and, in the eyes of critics, it helped sow the seeds of the great crash which engulfed the world some two decades later in 2008. In an extraordinary memorandum contained in files released by the National Archives in Kew, west London, Sir Robert put down on paper his doubts about the effect the changes were having. His note, dated March 17 1986, seven months before Big Bang, was addressed to Mrs Thatcher\u2019s private secretary Nigel Wicks, who would almost certainly have shown it to her. While he acknowledged his concerns were \u201cpretty vague and unspecific\u201d, he said that he was by no means alone in harbouring such doubts. Sir Robert Armstrong I do not know whether you are having the same experience but I am finding, among people who work outside the City of London but whose activities bring them into touch in some degree with the City, that there is increasing disquiet about the things that people think are going on in the City. I do not just mean the levels of remuneration; a lot of people, including some from inside the City, think that is a bubble that will be pricked in a year or two. They think more about the way in which corners are being cut and money is being made in ways that are at least bordering on the unscrupulous. It tends to be summed up by the people saying that they doubt whether it really is good enough any more to leaving the policing of the City to self-regulation. Thirty years on the same doubts are nagging. The Russian rouble has made modest gains agains the dollar, most likely propped up by state intervention. The Russian currency is currently trading at around 57.4 against the dollar, having gained 1.5% on Tuesday, the final day of trading before Russia begins New Year holidays. Analysts think the Russian authorities have ordered state companies to sell dollars to support the currency. Vladimir Miklashevsky at Danske Bank said the authorities will do everything to ensure the rouble stays below 60 to the dollar. We think that state companies were \u2018explicitly recommended\u2019 to sell foreign currency so that the rouble ends the year on a beautiful note. So much for the eurozone crisis. Italy and Spain, the countries deemed to be most at risk from the ripple effects of a Greek default, have seen yields on their 10-year bonds fall to all time lows. Yields on Italy\u2019s 10-year bonds have fallen below 1.9% for the first time, while Spain\u2019s are below 1.6%, according to Reuters. Falling bond yields indicates that investors see the debt of these governments as less risky. Network Rail\u2019s chief executive will not get a bonus this year, following Christmas travel chaos caused by overrunning engineering work. Mark Carne, who was criticised for being on holiday at the time of the disruption, could have picked up a \u00a333,000 bonus. Today he said he would not be collecting a bonus I am accountable for the railways and the performance (over Christmas) was not acceptable so I have decided that I should not take my bonus this year. He earns a salary of \u00a3675,000 and was on holiday in Cornwall while engineers were undertaking repair work. Other top executives at Network Rail are entitled to annual performance-related bonuses of up to 20% of salaries. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: We welcome this decision by Mark Carne but, like many of his trains, it is running late - 72 hours late in this case. He should have announced it on Sunday when it became clear of the level of chaos suffered by tens of thousands of passengers caught up in the King\u2019s Cross shutdown. We hope that his fellow executives will now follow suit and announce they will also be giving up their large bonuses as well. Via Press Association Labour\u2019s shadow transport minister, Michael Dugher, has welcomed the decision, but wants to focus blame on the government. A Greek exit from the eurozone might be back on the agenda, but in one Baltic country the talk is all about joining the currency. Lithuania will become the 19th member of the currency union on Thursday. The country, with a population of 3m people, is the last of the Baltic states to join, following Estonia and Latvia. In an interview with the Financial Times, Rimantas Sadzius, Lithuania\u2019s finance minister, described joining the euro as \u201cthe final step in Lithuania\u2019s integration into the western world\u201d that began 10 years ago with its entrance into Nato and the EU. Joining the eurozone finalises this very important process. The advantages of being the Nato member, the EU member, the eurozone member are absolutely evident for everyone. As the Wall Street Journal has noted, Lithuania\u2019s membership brings an important procedural change to the European Central Bank. Up to now, all members of the central bank\u2019s policy-setting Governing Council have had a vote on policy. This will change next year with Lithuania becoming the currency bloc\u2019s 19th member. Voting rights will now be divided according to the size of countries. The largest five countries will share four votes, while the smaller 14 countries will share 11 votes. The change is important because it means that Germany\u2019s representative on the ECB, Jens Weidmann, will be denied a vote once every five meetings. Under the new rules, ECB members will still attend the meetings. It seems highly improbable that the ECB would use Weidmann\u2019s month on the sidelines to push through a policy that Germany opposed, such as monetary stimulus, or QE. But it will be interesting to see how the new dynamic plays out. The slowdown in the Italian economy has ended, according to the country\u2019s economy minister Pier Carlo Padoan. The minister told Corriere della Sera he expected a boost to consumer and business confidence. \u201cAfter three years of recession ... employment is starting to grow again. Italy\u2019s economy, the most sluggish in the euro zone for more than a decade, has not posted a single quarter of growth in the last three years. The government is forecasting economic output will fall 0.3% this year, before rising a meagre 0.6% in 2015. Via Reuters Russia\u2019s economic troubles are getting so much attention that it is easy to forget that Ukraine is also at risk of financial meltdown. Ukraine\u2019s currency, the hryvnia, has plummeted in value against the dollar in 2014, putting huge strain on the country\u2019s reserves. The simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine has knocked out factories in a region that once produced almost one fifth of the country\u2019s economic output. This morning Ukraine\u2019s central bank revealed that inflation may rise to 17-18% in 2015. The bank also said it expects to receive three tranches of credit from the International Monetary Fund after a visit by the fund on 8 January. Ukraine\u2019s reserves are expected to rise to $15bn next year thanks to IMF loans, having dwindled to $9.9bn in November. Greece\u2019s early elections risk damage its creditworthiness. So far, so unsurprising, but when the warning comes from a ratings agency it is worth paying attention. In a statement issued today, Fitch predicts that political uncertainty will remain high for months after the 25 January election. If the left-wing opposition Syriza party wins the largest share of the vote, it will receive a 50-seat bonus and will therefore be part of any government that is formed. Syriza has maintained a lead in the opinion polls over the incumbent centre-right New Democracy party since coming top in May\u2019s European elections. However, this lead has narrowed in recent weeks making the election a close call and an overall Syriza majority unlikely. If the formation of a new coalition is not possible, Greece (\u2018B\u2019/Stable) will return to the polls, which would further prolong the political uncertainty. There are two main channels through which political risk could put pressure on Greece\u2019s credit profile. Firstly, prolonged deadlock with the Troika combined with a lack of market access would strain the government\u2019s cash-flow by the summer, even assuming the budget was kept under tight control. Secondly, depending on the reaction of bank depositors to developments, the wider Greek economy could come under pressure from renewed capital outflows. Both of those factors would also put pressure on the new Greek government and its foreign creditors to reach an agreement. Intriguingly, Fitch see room for compromise between the troika (the IMF, the European Commission and European Central Bank) and a Syriza-led government. Syriza\u2019s leader, Alexis Tsipras, has moderated his party\u2019s stance since 2012 and has committed to maintaining a budgetary primary surplus and to honouring Greece\u2019s obligations to IMF and private creditors. However, the privatisation programme would most likely stall completely under a Syriza-led government and there would be upward pressure on the public sector wage bill. The property tax may also be targeted for removal and overall fiscal risk would increase. Weather watch Let\u2019s take a closer look at this morning\u2019s house price data and depress anyone who wants to get on the housing ladder. House price growth is slowing in every single UK region except the northeast of England. But average UK prices are still 8.3% higher than one year ago. Prices are soaring away in London and the south east, underlining how the capital and surrounding areas are becoming increasingly detached from the rest of the UK. Prices were rising fastest in St Albans, Reading, Belfast, London and Notthingham. Prices were static in Manchester, which topped Nationwide\u2019s list of worst-performing towns and cities - followed by Leicester, Cardiff, Sunderland and Nottingham. Howard Archer, senior UK economist at IHS, expects recent price rises to deter buyers, but thinks there could be a pick-up in demand in 2015. Looking ahead, significant restraint on house buyer interest and prices is still expected to come from more stretched house prices to earnings ratios, tighter checking of prospective mortgage borrowers by lenders and the prospect that interest rates will eventually start to rise in 2015. Many people may also be deterred from buying houses because they look pricey in a number of areas after recent sharp rises. Even so, the weakening of buyer interest in houses may be close to bottoming out and we see it picking up to a limited extent in 2015 from current levels. If bank credit is anything to go by, the eurozone economy is still in the doldrums. Lending to households and firms in the eurozone fell in November, albeit at a slower pace than previous months. Credit extended to the private sector fell 0.9% in November on the previous year, compared to a fall of 1.3% in October. The full data release from the European Central Bank is available here. The European Commission is toeing a diplomatic line ahead of Greek elections triggered by the loss of yesterday\u2019s presidential vote. Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, has been interviewed on French television this morning. Moscovici was criticised last month for interfering in the Greek presidential vote, by praising the Greek government. Today he is being especially careful. I want, we want, Greece to remain in the eurozone; it is good for the zone and it is good for Greece I fully respect the democratic choices freely made by the peoples of Europe. We must preserve the euro, our single currency, which is a common good. The statement that stood out most was this one. The eurozone is today more solid than in 2009-10... There is nothing to fear Discuss. Solid, not spectacular. That pretty much sums up retail analysts\u2019 verdict on Next\u2019s latest trading update. The retailer also gets credit for not resorting to Black Friday discounting. Nick Bubb, independent retail analyst Just like last year, Next has managed to allay fears about the impact of the apparent discounting frenzy pre-Xmas on the High Street, delivering solid +2.9% sales growth in the period from Tuesday October 28th to Wednesday December 24th. Next\u2019s initial view on 2015/16 is cautious, despite a relatively benign UK economic outlook, but it is still confident enough to declare another 50p special dividend and raise its indicative share buyback limit from \u00a364.25 to \u00a367, so there is plenty here for the City to be pleased with. Neil Saunders, managing Director of Conlumino Kicking off the festive reporting season, Next has posted a solid set of numbers, especially so given that they are measured against some tough year on year comparatives (last year total sales were up 11.9%). The figures are a vindication of Next\u2019s refusal to engage in pre-Christmas discounting, including the popular Black Friday event. While this may have cost Next some sales growth over the reported sales period, we believe that it has not lost it much, if anything, in terms of profits. Indeed, this is reflected the profit guidance which is some \u00a35m ahead of where it was in October. European stock markets, including the FTSE100, have opened on a downer. Market watchers are blaming oil prices, which fell to a new five and a half year low on Tuesday. A barrel of Brent crude is now around $57 and is expected to drop further. Here is a snapshot of the markets: FTSE100 -0.6% at 6,596 points France\u2019s CAC 40 -0.86% at 4,280 points Germany\u2019s DAX -0.57% at 9,870 points Spain\u2019s IBEX -0.4% at 10,352 points Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB -0.5% at 19,032 points Shares in Next are up 2.7% this morning, after it reported healthy sales in the run-up to Christmas. Next said total sales rose 7.7% in the year to 24 December. Full-price sales were up 2,9% in the final quarter, at the upper end of the company\u2019s expectations. Next shareholders will be getting a late Christmas present in the form of a special dividend worth 50p per share. But the retailer is not getting carried away with the festive spirit, warning that it remains \u201cvery cautions\u201d in its sales budgets for the year ahead. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. The gap between the London property market and the rest of the country is growing wider, with house prices in the capital accelerating faster than anywhere else. The average price of a London home reached \u00a3406,730 in 2014, with prices up 17.8% over the last twelve months, according to data released by Nationwide. The average house price for the UK was \u00a3189,002, a rise of 7.2% over the year. However, house price growth was slowing in every region, apart from the north east of England. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: This marks the fourth consecutive month in which annual growth has moderated, despite house prices increasing by 0.2% month on month in December. The 7.2% increase recorded over the year as a whole, is modestly lower than the 8.4% gain recorded in 2013. While cooling in the London market is a part of the story, this is not the main explanation for the slowdown evident in the UK figures in recent months. Indeed, annual price growth in the capital continued to outpace every other region in the UK, at 17.8% in Q4. Overall, 12 of the 13 UK regions saw the pace of annual price growth slow. He also describes the slowdown in house prices as surprising, but expects things to pick up next year. If the economic backdrop continues to improve as we and most forecasters expect, activity in the housing market is likely to regain momentum in the months ahead. Supply side developments will be crucial in determining the trajectory for prices. There are encouraging signs that construction is starting to pick up. Hopefully, this will set the stage for house price growth gradually converging with income growth in the quarters ahead. Meaning wage growth is weak and houses are increasingly hard to afford. Apart from that we will be taking a closer look at Next\u2019s trading statement. The high street veteran has reported total sales were up 7.7% up to and including Christmas Eve. Next are the first of the big retailers to report their Christmas trading. All that and more to follow...",

So far, so unsurprising, but when the warning comes from a ratings agency it is worth paying attention.</p> <p>In a statement issued today, Fitch predicts that political uncertainty will remain high for months after the 25 January election.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <blockquote> <p>If the left-wing opposition Syriza party wins the largest share of the vote, it will receive a 50-seat bonus and will therefore be part of any government that is formed. </p> <p>Syriza has maintained a lead in the opinion polls over the incumbent centre-right New Democracy party since coming top in May\u2019s European elections.</p> <p> However, this lead has narrowed in recent weeks making the election a close call <strong>and an overall Syriza majority unlikely</strong>. If the formation of a new coalition is not possible, Greece (\u2018B\u2019/Stable) will return to the polls, which would further prolong the political uncertainty.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>There are two main channels through which political risk could put pressure on Greece\u2019s credit profile.<strong> Firstly, prolonged deadlock with the Troika combined with a lack of market access would strain the government\u2019s cash-flow by the summer</strong>, even assuming the budget was kept under tight control. Secondly, depending on the reaction of bank depositors to developments,<strong> the wider Greek economy could come under pressure from renewed capital outflows</strong>. Both of those factors would also put pressure on the new Greek government and its foreign creditors to reach an agreement.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>Intriguingly, Fitch see room for compromise between the troika (the IMF, the European Commission and European Central Bank) and a Syriza-led government.</p> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Syriza\u2019s leader, Alexis Tsipras, has moderated his party\u2019s stance since 2012 and has committed to maintaining a budgetary primary surplus and to honouring Greece\u2019s obligations to IMF and private creditors. However, the privatisation programme would most likely stall completely under a Syriza-led government and there would be upward pressure on the public sector wage bill.

Indeed, annual price growth in the capital continued to outpace every other region in the UK, at 17.8% in Q4. Overall, 12 of the 13 UK regions saw the pace of annual price growth slow.</p> </blockquote> <p>He<strong> </strong>also describes the slowdown in house prices as <strong>surprising, </strong>but expects things to pick up next year.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the economic backdrop continues to improve as we and most forecasters expect, activity in the housing market is likely to regain momentum in the months ahead.

      "bodyText": "Leading shares ended the last full day of trading before the New Year on a downbeat note. After eight days of rises, the FTSE 100 fell 86.51 points or 1.3% to 6547.00. On this day fifteen years ago the index hit its all time peak of 6930, and despite attempting to regain it during the year, that target now seems some way off. Meanwhile it would take a major surge in Wednesday\u2019s curtailed trading session for the index to maintain a 12 year run of December gains, given it started the month at 6722. A volatile oil price - Brent crude fell as low as $56.74 a barrel on concerns of oversupply and falling demand before recovering to edge up to $58 - put pressure on energy companies. Royal Dutch Shell A shares fell 48.5p to \u00a321.60, while Tullow Oil dropped 6.9p to 415.4p. BG lost 21.1p to 868.6p despite its partner Petrobras submitting declarations of commerciality for three oil and gas fields in Brazil and BP ended 8.7p lower at 409.3p even as it confirmed it had started production from the Kinnoull field in the north sea. Continuing concerns about economic growth in China, a key consumer of commodities, left the mining sector lower, with Anglo American down 11p at 1203.5p and BHP Billiton 17p lower at \u00a313.90. But a jump in the gold price as investors sought a haven in the uncertainty helped push Randgold Resources 92p higher to \u00a343.36 and Mexican precious metals miner Fresnillo up 19p to 768.5p. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said: If things carry on as they are it doesn\u2019t look as if the FTSE 100 will have a particularly happy New Year period. But then 2014 as a whole has been disappointing for the index, as it fell behind its peers. Other indices may have seen fresh all-time highs during the year but the FTSE 100 is still yet to revisit the highs last seen back in 1999. As oil and mining stocks remain weak, it seems that this baleful situation is not likely to change. Royal Mail, which moved higher on Monday in the wake of the collapse of rival City Link, fell back again to close 15.9p lower at 426.6p. A notable gainer was retailer Next, up 210p to \u00a367.25 after a better than expected Christmas performance. Airlines also climbed higher, with the weak oil price leading to cheaper fuel costs. EasyJet added 22p to \u00a316.64 and British Airways owner International Airlines Group put on 10p to 481.7p. Among the mid-caps, property website Rightmove rose 30p to \u00a322.30 as it unveiled a share buyback programme due to start on 2 January.",

When Kristy and Coulter decided to start a family, Kristy was working full time as an executive assistant and engineering coordinator at a gaming company. Little Quinn was born and suddenly Kristy found herself staring at three whole months without work. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16e8f79f902ff025c1d5687a3549610538db9453\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/15/1418680046868/33275c47-10cf-452c-b1b8-a5a60f26973e-460x375.png\" alt=\"Quinn\" width=\"460\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quinn popcorn, which boasts that customers can look up their batch online</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quinn Popcorn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Starting a business at the same time as starting a family might seem risky, but Kristy saw it as a turning point in her life, and besides, when would she have any time off again? </p> <p>Kristy had always dreamt of doing something in food, maybe one day of selling something at the farmers\u2019 market, she explains. </p> <p>She and her husband had been experimenting at home with making organic, natural versions of microwave popcorn, with real cheese and rosemary. They saw the potential for a business. <br></p> <p> So while Coulter continued to go to work, Kristy changed diapers, got up multiple times in the middle of the night and made call after call to suppliers and supermarkets. At the end of the three months she had pitched Whole Foods on a product that did not yet exist, so it was time to make it a reality. Kristy turned to a then-untested site: Kickstarter.<br></p> <p> They didn\u2019t tell their families, hoping the market would vote on its own. And so, without telling a single soul, not their parents or friends or anyone at all that they knew, Kristy and Coulter put Quinn Popcorn on Kickstarter. The logistics were challenging: finding the right kind of paper for the packaging and getting a farmer that sells 5,000 pounds of cheese to settle for selling 50 pounds. </p> <p>They did not want the funding to come from the people who love them \u2013 they wanted it to be a real measure of demand for the product in the real world. But part of it, Kristy admits, is they knew if family and friends found out they were starting a business, putting all their savings and lives into it just when they had a baby, everyone would think \u201cwe were off our rockers.\u201d</p> <p> Kristy and Coulter set a modest goal of $10,000 and waited. They told themselves not to expect anything. That first morning of their campaign they checked the site and were shocked when they saw they had $3,000 already. Kickstarter then put their campaign on its homepage and as the funding site started to get a blitz of media attention in outlets like the New York Times and Reuters<em>,</em> Quinn Popcorn got taken for a publicity ride along with them. In the end they raised $30,000 and Quinn Popcorn was born. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"058b4bb6b72bcc828bd35eec24671380f95b8a96\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/22/1419264515097/19d617d7-5001-4225-85dd-d6927473fb26-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"pigs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two entrepreneurs wondered what would happen if you could make bacon flavor that even vegetarians could eat.

J&amp;D\u2019s Foods, the makers of Bacon Salt, owe their start to co-founder Dave Lefkow\u2019s son. But more on that later.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>What the world needs, they both agreed, is more bacon.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> Some years back, Justin Esch (the J in J&amp;D) and Dave were both working at a software company that they felt was not going anywhere. They were both looking around for the next opportunity when they found themselves at a conference in Miami. <br></p> <p>Well, to be exact, they found themselves drinking tequila on a beach in Miami, throwing out ideas for their next move when Justin mentioned how he had gone to a Jewish wedding and spent the entire time extolling the virtues of bacon to people who had never tasted it, Dave tells the Guardian. <br></p> <p>What the world needs, they both agreed, is more bacon. Kosher, vegetarian, bacon flavor that anyone can eat. <br></p> <p> Flash forward some time later, and Dave had started his own consulting firm, Justin was working at another software company and money was good. <br></p> <p>There was no reason anymore to take a risk and start something new, but bacon salt was too good an idea to forget. <br></p> <p>After a few experiments in Dave\u2019s kitchen with sea salt were declared a \u201cdisaster\u201d, they guys got the professionals to mock up a recipe. </p> <p> It was time to see if bacon salt could be a reality. Around the same time, Dave\u2019s son, who was then three, smacked him in the face with a Wiffle ball, an embarrassment caught on video that Dave\u2019s wife suggested they send in to <em>A</em>merica\u2019s Funniest Home Videos on a lark. A few weeks later they found out they had won $5,000, not bad for a few seconds of \u201cwork\u201d. </p> <p> Dave and Justin decided to use the unexpected bounty to pay for their first batch of bacon salt. So they soon found themselves with 6,000 jars of bacon salt in Dave\u2019s garage and their next challenge. <br></p> <p>How to sell it? This was 2007, when Myspace was big, so they had a brilliant idea. They created a Myspace page for bacon salt and sent friend requests to every person they could find on Myspace who had written that they love bacon in their profiles. The tactic paid off better than they could have ever guessed. Within five days they had sold all the jars of bacon salt to people across 12 countries and 25 states. After that, they booked a contract supplying to supermarket chain Kroger. </p> <p> Two months after selling bacon salt out of a garage with local high school kids and family doing the packaging, the guys had become full-time bacon salt magnates and left their jobs. </p> <p>These days the Lewis\u2019 and Dave and Justin\u2019s days are very different from anything they would have imagined.</p> <p> Every day is \u201cchaos\u201d, says Dave, laughing. No two days are alike, says Kristy, who chatted with the Guardian while driving through the vastness of Nebraska, illustrating her point. Some days it is \u201cputting out fires\u201d, others it is just dealing with the regular course of operations, says Kristy. But despite the pressure and constant work, one thing is true, they couldn\u2019t be happier with where life took them. </p> <p>Oh, and Dave\u2019s son who won him that startup cash? He wants his money back, says Dave. </p>",

At the end of the three months she had pitched Whole Foods on a product that did not yet exist, so it was time to make it a reality. Kristy turned to a then-untested site: Kickstarter. They didn\u2019t tell their families, hoping the market would vote on its own. And so, without telling a single soul, not their parents or friends or anyone at all that they knew, Kristy and Coulter put Quinn Popcorn on Kickstarter. The logistics were challenging: finding the right kind of paper for the packaging and getting a farmer that sells 5,000 pounds of cheese to settle for selling 50 pounds. They did not want the funding to come from the people who love them \u2013 they wanted it to be a real measure of demand for the product in the real world. But part of it, Kristy admits, is they knew if family and friends found out they were starting a business, putting all their savings and lives into it just when they had a baby, everyone would think \u201cwe were off our rockers.\u201d Kristy and Coulter set a modest goal of $10,000 and waited. They told themselves not to expect anything. That first morning of their campaign they checked the site and were shocked when they saw they had $3,000 already. Kickstarter then put their campaign on its homepage and as the funding site started to get a blitz of media attention in outlets like the New York Times and Reuters, Quinn Popcorn got taken for a publicity ride along with them. In the end they raised $30,000 and Quinn Popcorn was born. Bacon Not everyone is brave enough to take the leap with a newborn, but kids can be a surprising advantage in business \u2013 and not just because they drive their parents desire to succeed. J&amp;D\u2019s Foods, the makers of Bacon Salt, owe their start to co-founder Dave Lefkow\u2019s son. But more on that later. Some years back, Justin Esch (the J in J&amp;D) and Dave were both working at a software company that they felt was not going anywhere. They were both looking around for the next opportunity when they found themselves at a conference in Miami. Well, to be exact, they found themselves drinking tequila on a beach in Miami, throwing out ideas for their next move when Justin mentioned how he had gone to a Jewish wedding and spent the entire time extolling the virtues of bacon to people who had never tasted it, Dave tells the Guardian. What the world needs, they both agreed, is more bacon. Kosher, vegetarian, bacon flavor that anyone can eat. Flash forward some time later, and Dave had started his own consulting firm, Justin was working at another software company and money was good. There was no reason anymore to take a risk and start something new, but bacon salt was too good an idea to forget. After a few experiments in Dave\u2019s kitchen with sea salt were declared a \u201cdisaster\u201d, they guys got the professionals to mock up a recipe. It was time to see if bacon salt could be a reality. Around the same time, Dave\u2019s son, who was then three, smacked him in the face with a Wiffle ball, an embarrassment caught on video that Dave\u2019s wife suggested they send in to America\u2019s Funniest Home Videos on a lark. A few weeks later they found out they had won $5,000, not bad for a few seconds of \u201cwork\u201d. Dave and Justin decided to use the unexpected bounty to pay for their first batch of bacon salt. So they soon found themselves with 6,000 jars of bacon salt in Dave\u2019s garage and their next challenge. How to sell it? This was 2007, when Myspace was big, so they had a brilliant idea. They created a Myspace page for bacon salt and sent friend requests to every person they could find on Myspace who had written that they love bacon in their profiles. The tactic paid off better than they could have ever guessed. Within five days they had sold all the jars of bacon salt to people across 12 countries and 25 states. After that, they booked a contract supplying to supermarket chain Kroger. Two months after selling bacon salt out of a garage with local high school kids and family doing the packaging, the guys had become full-time bacon salt magnates and left their jobs. These days the Lewis\u2019 and Dave and Justin\u2019s days are very different from anything they would have imagined. Every day is \u201cchaos\u201d, says Dave, laughing. No two days are alike, says Kristy, who chatted with the Guardian while driving through the vastness of Nebraska, illustrating her point. Some days it is \u201cputting out fires\u201d, others it is just dealing with the regular course of operations, says Kristy. But despite the pressure and constant work, one thing is true, they couldn\u2019t be happier with where life took them. Oh, and Dave\u2019s son who won him that startup cash? He wants his money back, says Dave.",

      "bodyText": "Next is handing its shareholders a special dividend payout after the December cold snap delivered a late rush of Christmas shoppers to its doors. The retailer said sales were up 2.9% in the two months to Christmas Eve, which was at the top end of revised sales guidance provided by the company when it issued a profit warning in October. Investors welcomed the news, with its shares rising the most in the FTSE 100, gaining more than 3% to \u00a367.25. \u201cChristmas was definitely back-ended,\u201d said Next chief executive Simon Wolfson. \u201cPart of the reason was the weather was so clement all through November that Christmas almost took people by surprise when it came. As soon as the weather turned cold [at November\u2019s end] we saw our sales move back in line with expectations.\u201d Sales at Next stores edged up 0.5% during the period, while sales at its Directory home shopping business were up 7.5%, reflecting the growth of buying gifts online. The retailer also enjoyed a strong closing week as Britons flocked to its shops to buy presents in the last few days before Christmas. \u201cIt looks like a last-minute pre-Christmas rush and the strength of Directory saved Next from the impact of all the recent high street discounting,\u201d said independent retail analyst Nick Bubb, who referred to the retailer\u2019s weekly sales graph, which showed that after a difficult November, every week in December was up on the previous year \u2013 \u201cculminating in a huge last-minute rush\u201d. Next is one of the few retailers that does not run promotions before Christmas and, despite the success of one-day events such as Black Friday, Wolfson said he saw no reason to alter its full-price trading stance. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d he said of the raft of pre-Christmas sales. \u201cWe just have to make sure our budgets and forecasts are relevant in the context of that environment.\u201d Its stores and home shopping arm had a \u201cvery good day\u201d on Black Friday despite the absence of discounts, he added. Given the widespread use of price cuts to attract shoppers, Wolfson said it was impossible to say how Next had fared against competitors because \u201cso much volume was driven by discounting\u201d. Conlumino analyst Neil Saunders said Next\u2019s performance was \u201csolid\u201d, given it was an increase on strong figures a year ago, adding: \u201cThe figures are a vindication of Next\u2019s refusal to engage in pre-Christmas discounting. \u201cWhile this may have cost Next some sales growth over the reported sales period, we believe that it has not lost it much, if anything, in terms of profits. Indeed, this is reflected in the profit guidance, which is some \u00a35m ahead of where it was in October.\u201d Saunders said Next\u2019s figures reflected the wider trend over Christmas, with retailers\u2019 sales bolstered by online stores and services such as click and collect. Next, which was forced to lower its sales and profits guidance after the warm autumn weather hit demand for its winter clothing ranges, said significantly more stock had gone into its end-of-season sale, with clearance rates in line with its expectations. It now expects full-year profits to be between \u00a3765m and \u00a3785m. Wolfson also struck a positive tone about the coming year. He said: \u201cThe economic outlook for the UK consumer looks relatively benign. Low inflation, an end to real wage decline, healthy credit markets and strong employment all paint a somewhat more positive picture than recent years.\u201d Next said it remained cautious when drawing up its sales budgets for the new financial year, with the group pencilling in growth of between 2.5% and 7.5%. Profits were expected to grow in line with sales, the company added. The retailer has been returning cash to shareholders by buying back shares as well as declaring special dividends. It has already paid three special dividends \u2013 each of 50p and together worth \u00a3223m this year \u2013 and on Tuesday confirmed plans for a fourth payout, also set at 50p a share. Besi analyst Tony Shiret said Next\u2019s performance boded well for Marks &amp; Spencer. He said: \u201cM&amp;S has also tried to restrict discounting and hold full-price until late in the season. Next\u2019s ability to broadly hold profitability should offer some encouragement that M&amp;S will not see material profit forecast reductions following what has clearly been a tough autumn/winter all around the market.\u201d",

As Brent crude fell more than 1.5% to just below $57 a barrel on oversupply fears and worries about slowing demand, Royal Dutch Shell A shares are down 48.5p to \u00a321.60 while BP has dropped 5.4p to 412.6p and Tullow Oil has slipped 7.3p to 415p. BG has lost 17.2p to 872.5p despite its partner Petrobras submitting declarations of commerciality for three oil and gas fields in Brazil. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently down 43.41 points at 6590.10, with investors also nervous about the prospects for the eurozone in the wake of Monday\u2019s call for a snap election early next year. The anti-austerity party Syriza is currently leading the polls. Bucking the downward trend in a big way is Next, up 275p to \u00a367.90 after a better than expected Christmas update, showing a 2.9% rise in sales in the run up to the festive holiday. Marks &amp; Spencer has benefited from the positive news, up 2.3p to 485.5p but analyst Nick Bubb said: Whether the better than feared sales growth and profit guidance from Next reflects the fact that all the High Street discounting wasn\u2019t as bad as it looked or that Xmas spending in general was good is, as yet, unclear. Also higher were the airlines, on hopes of falling fuel costs after the latest crude oil slide. EasyJet has climbed 19p to \u00a316.61 while British Airways owner International Airlines Group is 3.1p higher at 474.8p.",
