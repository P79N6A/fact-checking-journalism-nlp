      "bodyText": "Shareholders in Crest Nicholson, one of the largest housebuilders in Britain, have voted against a pay deal for the company\u2019s directors because of concerns that the performance targets were too easy. The rebellion means Crest Nicholson is the first major company this year to see investors reject its remuneration report, which is a major embarrassment. More than 58% of votes cast by shareholders at Crest Nicholson\u2019s annual meeting on Thursday were against the pay deal. The housebuilder said after the meeting that it still planned to pay out the controversial bonuses at the centre of the pay row. The vote against the remuneration report is symbolic and non-binding, with investors approving the remuneration policy \u2013 which sets the broad approach to pay for the next three years and is a binding vote. However, other companies, notably Thomas Cook and defence group Chemring, have changed their pay deals after smaller rebellions from shareholders. The pay deal was rejected after Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), the influential advisory body, urged investors to vote against it before the meeting because it said the profit target that Crest Nicholson had to reach to trigger the bonus payments was too easy. ISS said the profit target had been lowered \u201cwithout any compelling rationale provided by the company\u201d. Crest Nicholson\u2019s remuneration report outlined further plans to cut the target for pre-tax profit growth from 16%-20% a year ago to 5%-8% for the 2017 to 2019 period, citing challenging trading conditions. The target had already been cut from the 18%-22% in 2015. If the company hits the target, then chief executive Stephen Stone will receive a share bonus worth almost \u00a3812,000 on top of his salary of \u00a3541,158 and cash bonuses, while chief operating officer Patrick Bergin could collect \u00a3562,500 on top of his \u00a3375,000 salary. Standard Life Investments, Crest Nicholson\u2019s second biggest shareholder, confirmed it voted against the remuneration report. It said: \u201cWe were disappointed that the company chose to substantially reduce the profit range at which incentives for management were paid, without consulting shareholders. As a result, we voted against the remuneration report.\u201d Crest Nicholson said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the vote and said the performance targets for the share awards, which also includes a measure on the returns made from money spent by the company, were \u201csufficiently stretching\u201d. It added: \u201cEvery year, we have a regular dialogue with leading shareholders on a range of matters including remuneration. \u201cDuring the course of this year, we will continue this engagement with shareholders and will discuss remuneration arrangements and next year\u2019s long-term incentive plan targets, and seek to better communicate underlying rationale to shareholders with earlier engagement.\u201d It is rare for shareholders to reject a company\u2019s remuneration report. Last year, shareholders voted against a \u00a314m pay package for the chief executive of BP and the remuneration report of Smith &amp; Nephew, the medical equipment group. Chris Cummings, chief executive of the Investment Association, which represents shareholders, warned earlier this month that companies could face rebellions at this year\u2019s annual meetings. He said: \u201cAs the starting gun is fired on this year\u2019s AGM season, businesses around the UK would do well to heed the lessons from Brexit. \u201cToo many people still feel they are not sharing in this country\u2019s prosperity. Companies can either act responsibly now and shape a more responsible 21st-century corporate Britain or they can carry on as before and have it foisted upon them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Panic over for Next shareholders? It\u2019s too soon to sound the all-clear since a steeper decline in profits than last year\u2019s 4% fall to \u00a3790m is very possible this time. Chief executive Lord Wolfson also has a longer list of grumbles than usual: inflation, currencies, the squeeze on real incomes and consumers\u2019 new love of entertainment over \u201cstuff\u201d. For the time being, he won\u2019t risk a penny of shareholders\u2019 funds on share buy-backs in case the retailing weather turns nastier. Yet, after a near-halving in Next\u2019s stock market value over the past 16 months, there\u2019s a fair argument that the gloom is in the price. Some of Next\u2019s woes were self-inflicted last year, which ought to make them easier to address. It concentrated on sharper fashion ranges and fell short on \u201ceasy to wear styles\u201d \u2013 or school uniforms for the office, as outsiders unkindly describe them. Fixing the error doesn\u2019t look too hard. The factor that has really driven the steep fall in the share price is the suspicion that Next\u2019s troubles run deeper than a temporary shortage of the right blouses. Too many shops for the age of internet shopping? Too much reliance on cheap credit to supercharge Directory, Next\u2019s own online business? Wolfson tackled both worries persuasively. On the property front, he offered a \u201cportfolio stress test,\u201d asking what would happen if like-for-like sales in the shops continue to fall for another 10 years. In a truly bleak decade \u2013 defined as minus 6% every year \u2013 profit margins in the branches would halve but would still be 10% before counting central overheads. That is because Next would close unprofitable stores when their leases expire and could reasonably expect to renew leases on profitable stores at lower rents. There would be decline, but it would be profitable decline that generates cash. The complaint that Directory is addicted to customers who only buy on credit is starting to look overdone. Credit account customers are still the majority but their number fell 3% last year; cash customers increased 14%. Add it all up and Next\u2019s current troubles don\u2019t look severe, assuming it remembers who its customers are. This is still a business that expects to generate surplus cash this year of \u00a3300m after capital expenditure and after paying an ordinary dividend that offers a yield of 3.7%. If one takes a long view, crises of confidence in Next arrive about once a decade. Wolfson pointed out that the share price fell 33% in 1997-98 and plunged 50% in 2007-08, and each time rebounded to achieve new highs. One suspects recovery will be slower this time but, yes, you\u2019d bet on Next making it to the 2020s in reasonable shape. In the meantime, Wolfson\u2019s property stress test ought to be widely adopted. The supermarkets whoop excitedly about their growth in online sales but are shockingly shy about like-for-like sales trends in their big sheds. A Next-style analysis might be revealing. Huge defeat counts for nothing A 58% defeat for a remuneration report counts as a thumper, but Crest Nicholson cannot be surprised it happened. The housebuilder, based in the south-east, increased its pre-tax profits by 27% last year but the hurdle for directors to earn maximum jackpots will be set lower in future. Indeed, much lower: 8% growth per share annually will do for 2017-19 and, note, that\u2019s a cumulative figure. Naturally, the pay committee offered excuses for its generosity: Crest Nicholson has just enjoyed a period of exceptional profit growth; the pace can\u2019t be sustained; and executives will also be shooting at targets for returns on capital. OK, but tell it to the shareholders. Standard Life, the second largest, says it wasn\u2019t consulted on the lower targets. But here is the absurdity of that 58% against: nothing will happen as a result. Crest Nicholson will not alter the incentive target and is not obliged to do so because the vote was merely advisory. The separate binding vote, on the forward-looking policy, was bizarrely passed overwhelming. Nor will Jim Pettigrew, chair of the remuneration committee, be resigning in embarrassment. Why should he? He was simultaneously re-elected to the board with a 99% majority despite overseeing an incentive scheme that is supposedly far too lax. Crest Nicholson illustrates perfectly the silliness of the current system for voting on remuneration. Shareholders tend to rebel only when the votes are advisory, and giving a thumbs-down to an individual director is still seen as not the done thing. There are honourable exceptions, of course, but do not expect a revolution if the government legislates to make all votes on pay binding. Most fund managers prefer symbolic revolts to the real thing.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s only copy paper manufacturer, one of the largest remaining employers in Gippsland\u2019s Latrobe Valley, is concerned free trade negotiations with Indonesia could frustrate moves to impose anti-dumping tariffs. The Anti-Dumping Commission filed its report on paper imports to the federal government on Friday, after a 10-month investigation. The report is expected to adhere to recommendations of a preliminary report in November, which found Australian Paper had \u201csuffered material injury \u2026 as a result of dumped exports of the A4 copy paper exported from Brazil, China, Indonesia and Thailand\u201d and imposed interim tariffs. In a statement, the company indicated it was concerned recent comments by Indonesian trade officials could influence the outcome and urged the federal government to \u201chold firm\u201d. \u201cThe confirmation of the Anti Dumping Commission\u2019s findings will be an opportunity to restore fairness to the local copy paper market so that Australian Paper is secure to invest in the future of Latrobe Valley manufacturing,\u201d chief operating officer Peter Williams said. \u201cAny country which has been selling dumped and/or subsidised copy paper into the Australian market has been putting local jobs at risk.\u201d Senior trade official Thomas Lembong told Fairfax Media ahead of an Australian trade mission to Indonesia this month that Indonesia wanted to remove trade barriers for paper products and \u201csee concrete proof of unfettered and natural trade\u201d. It echoed an earlier statement from Indonesian president Joko Widodo. Victorian Labor senator Kim Carr said comments by Indonesia were causing \u201csignificant anxiety\u201d in the industry and could have \u201chuge consequences\u201d for Australian Paper\u2019s mill at Maryvale, which supports 1,300 direct jobs. The Latrobe Valley has lost up to 800 jobs in the past six months with the closure of the Hazelwood coal-fired power plant, which will switch off for good next week. The Victorian government announced a $85m spending package to create new jobs in the region and 150 workers from Hazelwood were transferred to other power stations, but the area still has the highest unemployment rate in the state. \u201cGippsland is not exactly booming,\u201d Carr told Guardian Australia. \u201cThis is one of the poorest areas in Australia. This is an area that\u2019s suffering profound economic dislocation.\u201d He accused the Turnbull government of \u201cpursuing an ideological agenda at the expense of blue collar workers\u201d. \u201cThis is at a time when Australian Paper actually wants to expand its production,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a big investment program, but it needs to have the security of ensuring that they can actually sell its products. This is not the sort of behaviour that the Americans would put up with.\u201d The US imposed 17% anti-dumping duties on paper exports from Indonesia in 2016. The Maryvale mill received a $92m grant under the Rudd/Gillard government to build facilities to make 100% recycled copy paper, under an agreement that it would supply Australian government departments. Just under 60% of the A4 paper bought by government departments in 2015-16 was manufactured at Maryvale. Australian Paper also supplies 60% of the paper used by the Victorian government, and finance minister Robin Scott said that figure should rise following recent negotiations to buy recycled paper. The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union spokesman Alex Millar said trade minister Steve Ciobo\u2019s comment while in Indonesia that interim duties imposed last year were \u201cbeing reviewed\u201d suggested the government had \u201cmeddled\u201d in the independent commission and were creating further industry uncertainty. Millar also criticised delays in the commission\u2019s investigation, which stretched the inquiry out to more than twice the length of the mandated 155 days. The assistant industry minister, Craig Laundy, who has until 16 April to respond to and publish the report, said he would make a decision on its recommendations \u201cas soon as practicably possible\u201d. \u201cThis government is a strong supporter of Australia\u2019s anti-dumping system,\u201d Laundy said in a statement to Guardian Australia. \u201cIt supports international trade, but it must be fair trade.\u201d",

The shoe retailer, which employs 1,145 people, has nearly 100 stores and a handful of concessions in department stores. It is understood to be close to going under after a deal with a private equity firm collapsed. Jones\u2019s difficulties came a day after rival shoe retailer Brantano fell into administration putting more than 1,000 jobs at risk. Bothare owned by Alteri, a private equity investor. Pavers, a York-based footwear specialist, is believed to be interested in buying some of the Jones stores to add to its 120-store chain but a deal is not expected to be finalised in time to resolve a cash crunch caused by a forthcoming rental bill. Other parties, thought to include the footwear group Kurt Geiger, are also interested in buying the 160-year old Jones brand. More than one source close to the situation said a potential deal to rescue the chain, with the buyout firm Endless, had fallen through because Alteri wanted more cash than was on offer from potential buyers. One source said the Endless deal collapsed only hours before completion as Alteri wanted \u00a31m more than the \u00a310m offered. Alteri has been in negotiations to sell Jones for several weeks but filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators last week, which protected the retailer from creditors seeking to recover debts for a limited period. Specialist footwear retailers have been under pressure in recent years as clothing chains such as New Look and H&amp;M have increased the number of shoes and boots they sell. Last year\u2019s relatively mild winter, which has led to lower sales of higher-priced boots, and increases in business rates and the legal minimum wage have added to pressure on the industry. The cost of sourcing goods abroad has also risen since the value of the pound collapsed against the dollar after the Brexit vote last June. Brantano is not the first British retail group to collapse under the control of Alteri, a group backed by the US private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Last year the tailoring specialist Austin Reed went into administration soon after Alteri increased its control over the group\u2019s debt. Many retailers have struggled to cope with rising costs and lacklustre sales this year. The upmarket lingerie brand Agent Provocateur was rescued by a sale to Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley via a pre-pack administration this month. Jones has humble beginnings. The business was launched in 1857 by Alfred Jones and his wife Emma who opened their first store in Bayswater, west London, before expanding nationwide. The Bayswater store opened from 8am to 8pm, and until midnight on Saturdays, while the pair looked after 11 sons and three daughters.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is axing 158 branches, most of them NatWest outlets, with the loss of up to 362 jobs. The group, which is 73% taxpayer-owned, blamed the move on customers spurning the traditional branch counter service in favour of doing their banking on the internet and mobile phones. RBS is the latest high street player to announce branch cuts. In January, HSBC said it was shutting a further 62 branches this year, on top of 55 already earmarked for closure, while Yorkshire building society revealed it was closing 48 branches, 28 of which are Norwich &amp; Peterborough outlets. Last July, Lloyds Banking Group announced the closure of 200 branches. The Unite union accused RBS of \u201cturning its back\u201d on communities that had been the foundation of its business for generations, and said these latest cuts were on top of 86 closures announced late last year. However, the group said: \u201cAs customers change the way they bank with us, we must change the way we serve them.\u201d A spokesman for the bank said after a review of its network a decision had been taken to close 30 RBS branches and 128 NatWest outlets. He said: \u201cWe have seen a dramatic shift in the way our customers are choosing to bank, with more using mobile and online over traditional branch counters. Simple transactions undertaken in branch at NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland have fallen by 43% since 2010, while online and mobile transactions have increased by more than 400%.\u201d About 770 staff will be affected by the closures, of whom 300 will be moved to other jobs. That leaves 472 at risk of redundancy, though the bank said the maximum number that would be leaving the bank was 362. The spokesman said the role of the branch was fast moving to a \u201ccentre for advice\u201d and away from basic transactions. He added the branch \u201cwill still be a core part of our offering to customers\u201d, and said RBS had extended the time between announcing its decision and the branch closure to six months, so customers had more time to consider their options. The group also said it had created two roles to support our customers \u2013 community banker and \u201cTechXpert\u201d. Thirty-four of the branches being axed are in London and the south-east; 30 are in the north of England. After the closures there will be 151 RBS and 856 NatWest branches remaining. Unite has renewed calls for a moratorium on branch closures. Its acting general secretary, Gail Cartmail, said: \u201cIt\u2019s time for banking regulators and government to intervene to force banks to maintain an adequate network that properly serves communities across the UK.\u201d High street banks closed more than 1,000 branches in the UK between January 2015 and January 2017, with HSBC axing the most over this period, according to the consumer group Which?. However, last summer, the British Bankers\u2019 Association (BBA) said the average high street bank branch dealt with only 71 customer visits a day \u2013 a 32% decline since 2011 \u2013 as consumers switched to online methods of managing money. The average number of visits was projected to fall to only 51 a day within five years. The BBA report claimed customers were the biggest winners from the \u201cconsumer-led revolution\u201d but some commentators have expressed concern that advances in technology were being used to justify further branch closures. Campaigners have said more closures would affect vulnerable customers and regular users of branch counters, such as traders and voluntary groups.",

      "bodyText": "Markets on both sides of the Atlantic are trading slightly higher as investors await developments on the Republicans\u2019 crucial healthcare bill - which may or may not be put to the vote today. Stronger-than-expected data in the UK and the US has managed to keep sentiment broadly positive: FTSE 100: +0.1% at 7,332 Dow Jones: +0.2% at 20,703 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.7% at 11,984 France\u2019s CAC: +0.5% at 5,018 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.5% at 376 The pound has held on to its gains against the dollar and is currently up 0.3% at $1.2521. Sterling is also up 0.4% against the euro, at \u20ac1.1604. That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for your comments and please join us again tomorrow morning. The short-term lettings industry is attempting to clean-up its reputation with the creation of a new trade body. Airbnb has teamed up with Under The Doormat and various other sites to form the short-term accommodation association (STAA). The industry has been criticised for contributing to the housing crisis by taking properties out of the market. Merilee Karr, chairman of STAA and the founder of Under the Doormat, said the new body intended to create a new industry code: We understand there are concerns but the reality is that short-term lettings offer an opportunity for people to earn an extra source of income from their most important assets. Homeowners and families who have struggled through the financial crisis have the chance to make a little extra money when they are away. We will also set our industry code of conduct to raise the bar for our members and new market entrants to ensure the standards that we have all worked so hard to make are the industry norm. Unite, Britain\u2019s largest union, has renewed its calls for access to the single market after Brexit. It follows the strong car manufacturing figures for February. Len McCluskey, general secretary, said: These astonishingly good figures clearly demonstrate that the automotive industry is the \u2018jewel in the crown\u2019 of British manufacturing which the prime minister needs to vigorously fight for in the forthcoming Brexit negotiations. Unite\u2019s red line for the car industry is access to the European single market with no tariffs and a frictionless supply chain through membership of the customs union. Unite and the car companies are \u2018at one\u2019 in wanting this success story to continue \u2013 and protecting and enhancing the dominant role that the automotive industry plays in the British economy should be at the top of the prime minister\u2019s agenda when the Brexit talks start. New us home sales rose by 6.1% to 592,000 in February, the Commerce Department said. It was the highest level since July 2016. The figure for January was also revised up to 558,000 from an earlier estimate of 555,000. New home sales account for almost 10% of overall home sales, and were boosted last month by some unseasonably warm weather. An update on Greece now, where it is hoped record tourism will provide a boost to the crisis-hit economy. The Guardian\u2019s Helena Smith reports: Greece\u2019s largest carrier, Aegean Airlines, has reported a rise in passenger numbers despite a drop in profits. The record numbers visiting Greece were reflected in the airline\u2019s figures, which showed that passengers grew 7% in 2016 to 12.5 million. Despite the airline posting a 53% drop in net profit \u2013 mainly because of higher VAT offsetting a rise in sales - the carrier\u2019s load factor also increased by 0.6 percentage points to 77.4 percent. An unprecedented 30 million foreign tourists \u2013 almost three times the entire Greek population \u2013 are likely to visit the country this year. \u201cWe are expecting an exceptional year for tourism,\u201d Dimitris Tsiodras, spokesman of the centrist Potami party told the Guardian. \u201cHellenic bankers were just telling us that they expect tourism to play a significant role in stabilising the economy. It is the bright light on the horizon.\u201d In Syntagma square, overlooking the Greek parliament, kiosk owners were echoing that view this morning. \u201cIn the coming weeks the tourist season will begin and we can\u2019t wait!\u201d said Pavlos Yiannopoulos as he hung newspapers from a rack. \u201cWe need to become the Florida of Europe. After all these years of recession, it is our only hope.\u201d Tourism employs one in five Greeks in a nation where the jobless rate among the under 25\u2019s is over 50 percent. Trading is underway in the US and markets subdued ahead of the crucial vote on Trump\u2019s controversial healthcare bill. Dow Jones: -0.1% at 20,634 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,345 Nasdaq: -0.2% at 5,812 As we wait for the Wall Street bell to go, here are the latest scores across Europe: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 7,314 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.1% at 11,917 France\u2019s CAC: -0.04% at 4,993 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 20,011 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,242 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.1% at 375 US markets are expected to open slightly lower: Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, has been speaking at a Fed event in Washington, DC. Anyone looking for a steer on the timing of the next interest rate rise will be disappointed, as Yellen\u2019s focus was on young people and education, and not on monetary policy. She said more needed to be done to prepare young people for success in the jobs markets: Research presented over the next two days makes a compelling case that there is a need to also think longer term about how to prepare people for success in the labor market. This research underscores the value of starting young to develop basic work habits and skills, like literacy, numeracy, and interpersonal and organizational skills. These habits and skills help prepare people for work, help them enter the labor market sooner, meet with more success over time, and be in a position to develop the more specialized skills and obtain the academic credentials that are strongly correlated with higher and steadier earnings. Yellen said a better long-term approach would be beneficial to the wider economy: Our young people are the future, and we all want them to have the support they need for successful and fulfilling lives. As a central banker, I recognize the benefits to the broader economy when more people are better prepared for work and for managing their finances. In short, ensuring that all of our kids have \u201cstrong foundations\u201d will help build a similarly strong foundation for the U.S. economy. The full speech is available here. New US jobless claims rose unexpectedly last week. The US Labor Department said initial claims were 258,000 in the week ending 18 March, following 243,000 claims a week earlier (revised up from 241,000). Economists had forecast 240,000 claims for the latest week. Ben Broadbent, the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor for monetary policy, has given a speech in London on \u2018Brexit and the pound\u2019. He said consumers are already feeling the pinch from the drop in then value of the pound, and the effects are starting be reflected in shops sales: The vote to leave the EU led to a big drop in sterling\u2019s exchange rate. One consequence is a rise in import prices and a squeeze on households\u2019 real income. We may already be seeing the impact of that squeeze on retail spending, which in real terms fell quite sharply around the turn of the year. Exporters on the other hand are enjoying a \u201csweet spot\u201d, he argued, because their goods are cheaper abroad but Britain\u2019s current membership of the EU means they are not yet facing additional tariffs. The result \u2013 higher prices and profits but unchanged rules and costs \u2013 represents something of a sweet spot for exporters and businesses that compete with imports. The sweet spot is not expected to last, he adds, which could make businesses more cautious about investing. No sign yet of that much feared slowdown in British car manufacturing following the Brexit vote. The number of cars rolling off UK production lines rose 8% in February (compared with a year earlier), to 153,041. It was the strongest February in 17 years, and meant that factories turned out one car every 16 seconds last month according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The vast majority - 78% - were destined for overseas market, with cars built for export up 13.4%. Domestic demand for British-built cars was much weaker, falling 7.4%. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT trade body, used the figures as an opportunity to highlight the industry\u2019s concerns about possible trade tariffs post Brexit: Today\u2019s figures illustrate the continuing global popularity of British-built vehicles and the export-led nature of the industry. With eight out of every 10 cars we produce destined for international markets \u2013 and half of those for customers in the EU \u2013 we must avoid barriers to trade, whether tariff, customs or other regulatory obstacles, at all costs. To do otherwise would damage our competitiveness and threaten the continued success of UK automotive manufacturing.\u201d Returning to the official retail sales for February, the strong monthly figure masks the underlying weakness revealed by the broader three-month trend. Over the three months, retail sales volumes fell 1.4%, the biggest drop since March 2010. The ONS suggested that higher fuel prices made drivers less willing to fill-up their tanks over the period. The narrowing gap between growth in shop prices and retail sales on a three-month basis, is illustrated here: The pound is just about holding on to one-month highs above $1.25: The CBI has just published its own survey of the retail sector, which is also slightly ahead of expectations. Strength in the retail sector continued into March according to the business lobby group\u2019s distributive trades survey. Of the retailers surveyed, 44% said sales volumes were up on a year ago, while 35% said they were down. That gave a balance of +9%, matching February\u2019s figure but better than the +5% forecast by economists. It\u2019s not all plain sailing however. The CBI said retailers face the twin pressures of having to pay more for goods and materials, and increased competition. Anna Leach, head of economic intelligence at the group, explains: It\u2019s encouraging to see that sales volumes growth is holding up and expectations have strengthened. However, retailers continue to be squeezed by rising cost pressures on the one hand, and intense competition on the other, which will limit their ability to raise prices. With household spending growth set to slow as inflation rises, retailers seem likely to remain under pressure through this year. Read our full story on the bumper retail sales figures for February: The surprisingly sharp rise in retail sales suggests UK consumers were not deterred from spending by higher shop prices in February. But this could change, economists are warning. In the same month, higher food and fuel prices pushed inflation up to 2.3% in February - the highest in almost three-and-a-half years - from 1.8% in January. Prices are expected to rise further still, with inflation forecast to hit about 3% later this year. As price rises accelerate, wage growth is weakening, meaning that household finances are likely to come under increasing strain in the coming months. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, prefers to look at retail sales over the three months to February, which fell 1.4%, rather than the single month. With shoppers facing a combination of still-subdued pay growth and rising inflation, Q1\u2019s likely weak performance may be a harbinger for 2017 as a whole. Annual shop price inflation increased to 2.8% from 1.9% in January, a 60-month high. How the year pans out will depend heavily upon consumers\u2019 willingness to draw on savings or take on more debt. While these sources may deliver some mitigation to squeezed spending power, last year\u2019s retail boom looks set to become an increasingly distant memory.\u201d Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank: UK retail sales showed the first upwards surprise for 3 months. Will it last? With inflation getting higher and higher, the fundamentals would suggest not - i.e. the squeeze on disposable income is intensifying. The downward glide path should resume in the coming months. Here is how Asian markets ended the day, courtesy of traders at spread-betting firm IG: The stronger-than-expected retail sales have helped to push the pound higher against the dollar and the euro. Sterling is up 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2510 and up 0.5% against the euro at \u20ac1.1612. Alex Edwards, currency analyst at OFX, said a combination of factors were helping to drive the pound higher and could push it further still: Retail sales data was very strong this morning and sterling has rallied once again. It comes hot off the back of the headline inflation earlier in the week, with the hawkish MPC statement and rate vote results still resonating. It\u2019s likely to make for an even more aggressive BoE statement next month, with sterling up through 1.25 as a result. This recent combination of market data will likely support the pound through to the end of the week and perhaps into next. 1.26 could well be in sight. Figures just out show stronger than expected retail sales in February. Sales jumped 1.4%, signalling consumer resilience despite rising inflation and weak wage growth. Economists had forecast far weaker growth of 0.4%. The January figure was revised down to show a 0.5% drop in sales, bigger than the 0.3% drop initially estimated. A strong performance in February pushed the annual rate of growth to 3.7% from 1% in January. However, the Office for National Statistics cautioned the broader quarterly picture was less rosy. Retail sales over the three months to February fell by 1.4% form the second month in a row - the largest fall since March 2010 and only the second fall since December 2013. Kate Davies, senior statistician at the ONS, said: February\u2019s retail sales figures show fairly strong growth, though the underlying three-month picture shows falling sales as February\u2019s figures follow two consecutive months of decline in December and January. The monthly growth in February is seen across all store types. The underlying trend suggests that rising petrol prices in particular have had a negative effect on the overall quantity of goods bought over the last three months. Over in France, optimism among firms in the industrial sector fell to a four-month low in March, in a possible sign that uncertainty surrounding the presidential election is starting to weigh on confidence. The business climate index for the industrial sector, published by Insee, fell to 104 points in March from 107 in February. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index to stay at 107. European markets are in a subdued mood this morning as investors await the crucial US vote on the healthcare bill which seeks to overturn Obamacare. With many opposed to the bill in its current form, investors are concerned that should Trump lose the vote, his growth-boosting policy promises might not materialse. Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex: The markets got off to an understandably quiet start this Thursday, the European indices gently slipping into the red after the bell. There are a couple of reasons why investors may be sitting on their hands this morning. Firstly, the tragedy in Westminster on Wednesday is the kind of event that casts the cold light of perspective on the stock market\u2019s frivolities. Secondly, investors are waiting for the House of Representatives vote on \u2018Trumpcare\u2019 later in the day; if the President can\u2019t get the bill passed it would suggest he faces an uphill battle push through his tax and infrastructure reforms. And considering it was those promises that sent the Dow Jones et al. sky high, investors will likely not react well to that eventuality. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, says that investors knew what was coming from the retailer in the form of the first profit drop in eight years. Not a pretty set of figures from Next but no worse than expected after warning on profits in January. Following that dire Christmas trading update investors were prepared for this and the retailer remains extremely cautious about the year ahead. It was the first drop in annual profits in 8 years but investors seem to be reassured that it\u2019s taking steps to turn things around with a focus on core products. Next has to get its house in order and focus more on its core product \u2013 something it says it began doing in January. UK retail sales have held up in the months following the Brexit vote (led by clothing retail sales hit a 14-year peak in October) but Next has suffered \u2013 it\u2019s clearly not been getting things right. The question is whether a return to \u2018easy to wear styles that can be delivered in large volumes\u2019 will be enough to offset the external headwinds. Fundamentally the business remains strongly cash generative even if it\u2019s not expanding rapidly and is able to maintain solid returns to investors. Shares have already halved in value since the 2015 peak. With the Directory division performing very well it appears well placed to respond to consumer trends as they shift more spend online. Next is at the top of the FTSE 100 leader board this morning, despite reporting its first annual profits fall in eight years. Shares in the clothing and homeware retailer are up 6% at \u00a341.05 after it said pre-tax profit fell 5.5% to \u00a3790.2m last year. It was in line with City expectations, so investors were relieved there were no nasty surprises in the numbers. Chief executive Lord Wolfson said the year ahead was also looking challenging: The year ahead looks like it will be tough with a combination of economic, cyclical and internal factors working against us. Next also signalled a shift in emphasis in its clothing ranges, suggesting it had neglected simpler, popular ranges, in favour of more fashionable lines. In focussing so much energy on changing our buying culture, processes and adopting exciting new trends, we have omitted some of our best-selling, heartland product from our ranges. These are the easy to wear styles that can be delivered in large volumes and great prices across several colours. Corrective action is relatively straightforward and began in late January. We believe that some of these changes will begin to be reflected in our Summer ranges from May onwards, but we will not have our ranges where we want them until the Autumn season. Trading is Europe is underway and investors are in following Asia and Wall Street by taking a bit of a breather. The FTSE 100 is down 13 points or 0.2% at 7,312. Elsewhere in Europe: Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.1% at 11,914 France\u2019s CAC: flat at 4,995 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.2% at 19,985 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 10,242 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.03% at 374 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Asian markets are subdued after Wall Street stabilised on Wednesday. Fears that President Trump will not be able to deliver on his growth boosting policy pledges have not gone away, but investors appear to be taking a breather before today\u2019s crucial vote on the Republican healthcare bill in the US. The bill, which seeks to overturn Obamacare and has been a key priority for Trump from the outset, is a major test for the President. A failure to win the vote will ring alarm bells on Wall Street and beyond that Trump will not be able to deliver other policy pledges, such as tax giveaways and infrastructure spending. In Asia, the Hang Seng was down 0.2% at 24,278, while the Nikkei rose 0.2% to 19,085. Here is how Wall Street closed on Wednesday: Also today, we have official UK retail sales for February at 9.30am, giving an insight into how resilient consumers are feeling in the face of rising inflation and weak wage growth. The CBI will give its take on the retail sector in its latest distributive survey at 11am. And in the US, Janet Yellen, head of the Federal Reserve, will give a speech. We will be tracking all the key developments through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Brexit could damage the UK\u2019s efforts to tackle corruption and give multinationals leverage over the British government in bribery cases, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned. Business pressure to weaken bribery laws and an inability by the government to focus on non-Brexit issues are both risks associated with leaving the European Union, according to a new report by the group. While acknowledging the UK\u2019s \u201csolid progress\u201d in pursuing recent bribery investigations, the report warned that the proportion of cases relative to the country\u2019s importance in global finance was low. \u201cEfforts must be sustained to improve detection of foreign bribery and achieve stronger enforcement of its anti-bribery legislation,\u201d it said. The report praises the UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) for recent successes in pursuing major corruption cases, including a multimillion-pound settlement with the engineering giant Rolls-Royce earlier this year. However, several civil society groups told the report\u2019s authors they were concerned that \u201cBrexit could increase the risk of UK companies threatening to relocate and potential loss of UK jobs as a bargaining chip in negotiations with prosecutors over charges\u201d. \u201cGiven that the SFO has on its books some very large UK companies that are significant partners in the government\u2019s industrial strategy, this is a real concern for several NGOs in the UK,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis concern was echoed by the business community which highlighted the risk of losing impetus in the fight against foreign bribery.\u201d Duncan Hames, director of policy for Transparency International UK, said the OECD report \u201creinforces how important it is to maintain the independence and prosecution of serious bribery offences\u201d. He added: \u201cThose kind of considerations and threats shouldn\u2019t have any influence whatever in prosecuting wrongdoing wherever we find it.\u201d The report also warns that any potential economic downturn resulting from leaving the EU could damage government willingness to be seen to be aggressively regulating business. \u201cA tightening of the economy could result in significant strain on public resources, including for law enforcement, and in pressure to weaken the Bribery Act or its enforcement to attract business,\u201d it said. Sue Hawley, policy director of the civil society group Corruption Watch, said her organisation had warned of this risk last year, but recent events, including the creation of settlements whereby companies can resolve investigations with a fine and apology, had already damaged the UK\u2019s stance as a country hostile to corrupt money. Hawley cited interference by Tony Blair\u2019s government in the Serious Fraud Office investigation into BAE as an example of the kind of political interference about which the OECD would be concerned. Despite condemnation by the OECD after the BAE debacle, UK guidelines to law enforcement still do not prohibit factoring economic or political considerations into any prosecution decision. Separately, the OECD report also identifies Scotland, where highly secretive \u201climited partnerships\u201d can be incorporated, as notably vulnerable to money laundering. \u201cThe controversial limited partnership status, or so-called \u2018shell\u2019 companies, in Scotland appears to be vulnerable for misuse in money-laundering and corruption schemes,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis has prompted Scottish politicians to suggest that the murky nature of such arrangements is undermining Scotland\u2019s reputation as a place to do legitimate business.\u201d In a statement a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe government welcomes this report by the OECD which recognises our active enforcement of anti-bribery laws and we are proud that the UK continues to be commended as a global leader in the fight against bribery. \u201cWe will consider the recommendations made by the OECD as we continue to make the UK a more hostile environment for all forms of economic crime, including bribery, money laundering and fraud.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s retailers received a respite from a two-month losing streak when spending in high street stores and online bounced back in February. The Office for National Statistics said retail sales volumes were up by 1.4% on January and 3.7% higher than in February 2016. Sterling rose on the currency markets after news of the rise was announced, but the ONS said the bounce back had failed to recoup all the ground lost in December and January. It noted that spending was being curtailed by higher petrol prices. In the three months to February \u2013 considered a better guide to the underlying trend than the monthly figure alone \u2013 sales were 1.4% lower than in the quarter ending in November. The ONS said the quarterly fall matched that seen in January, which represented the weakest retail performance since March 2010, when the economy was just emerging from recession. Prices of goods were 2.8% higher in February than a year earlier, the sharpest increase since March 2012, with the cost of petrol up by more than 18%. Kate Davies, the ONS\u2019s senior statistician, said: \u201cFebruary\u2019s retail sales figures show fairly strong growth, though the underlying three-month picture shows falling sales as February\u2019s figures follow two consecutive months of decline in December and January. \u201cThe monthly growth in February is seen across all store types. The underlying trend suggests that rising petrol prices in particular have had a negative effect on the overall quantity of goods bought over the last three months.\u201d A separate study of high street spending suggested that the recovery in spending during February might have continued in March. The monthly distributive trades survey from the CBI showed that retailers had enjoyed better than expected trading conditions and were optimistic about a further improvement in April. Of the 65 retailers surveyed, 44% said business volumes were higher than a year earlier against 35% reporting a fall. Anna Leach, head of economic intelligence at the employers\u2019 organisation, said retailers continued to be squeezed by rising cost pressures and intense competition, limiting their ability to raise prices. \u201cWith household spending growth set to slow as inflation rises, retailers seem likely to remain under pressure through this year,\u201d he said. Ben Broadbent, one of the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governors, said in a speech in London that the fall in the value of the pound was having an impact on spending in the shops. \u201cThe vote to leave the EU led to a big drop in sterling\u2019s exchange rate,\u201d he said. \u201cOne consequence is a rise in import prices and a squeeze on households\u2019 real income. We may already be seeing the impact of that squeeze on retail spending, which in real terms fell quite sharply around the turn of the year.\u201d Broadbent added that the flipside of weaker retail spending was that UK goods sold overseas had become cheaper. \u201cWhile it\u2019s hit the income of households, however, the depreciation has come as a boon for many exporters. In sterling terms goods export prices rose 12% through the course of last year. This will significantly have boosted exporters\u2019 profitability and with it the incentive to invest in extra capacity.\u201d A combination of a more competitive pound and no change for the time being in trading rules with the EU meant exporters were currently in a sweet spot, Broadbent added, although he said it was unclear how long this period would last. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit said: \u201cThe consumer, which has provided the main engine of UK economic growth in recent years, is showing signs of running out of steam. Looking at the underlying trend, retail sales are falling at the fastest rate for seven years as households struggle with rising prices and subdued pay growth.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The retailer Next has said a failure to stock enough wardrobe staples had contributed to its first drop in annual profits for eight years. Last year the retailer sped up the way it puts together its clothing ranges to compete better with rivals such as Zara, H&amp;M and Primark, which take weeks rather than months to take clothes from the design stage to the stores. But the Next chief executive, Lord Wolfson, admitted the push, which in some cases saw decisions taken in three days rather than three months, led to mistakes that compounded the tough trading conditions it had faced in 2016. \u201cAlthough we had a lot of success with the product we bought in this way, we took our eye off heartland product which was missing from some of our ranges,\u201d he said. The retailer\u2019s focus on families with young children makes these affordable \u201ceasy-to-wear\u201d basics \u2013 which sell in huge volumes \u2013 an important ingredient in Next\u2019s success. Next said it would not be able to plug these gaps in its collections until the autumn. Next\u2019s profits fell 5.5% to \u00a3790m for the year to 28 January. Total retail sales fell by 2.9% to \u00a32.3bn. It is expecting a further drop in profits to between \u00a3680m and \u00a3780m this year as the retailer battles a wider slowdown in clothing sales. \u201cWe\u2019re of a size that what happens to the market happens to us,\u201d added Wolfson. In response to the tough high street trading conditions Next is seeking to make its stores more interesting places to shop. One experiment involves renting space in its largest store, in Manchester\u2019s Arndale centre, to a range of concessionaires including a hair salon, a prosecco bar and a florist to create an experience like a department store. Wolfson said he was \u201cextremely cautious\u201d about the outlook for the year ahead, identifying three key threats: shoppers spending less on clothes and more on eating out and holidays; price rises as a result of the drop in sterling; and weaker growth in consumers\u2019 incomes. He said: \u201cThe year ahead looks like it will be tough with a combination of economic, cyclical and internal factors working against us.\u201d Next said it had raised prices on the current spring and summer ranges by 4% on average, and warned that prices on the autumn and winter ranges would be 4% to 5% higher than in 2016. It blamed the collapse in the pound, which has pushed up the cost of imported goods. If sterling does not fall further next year, pricing pressure should ease into the second half of 2018, the company said. \u201cBy the same logic, the pressure on real wages from rising inflation may also work its way through the system by the middle of 2018,\u201d it said. Official figures this week showed that inflation, which was close to zero a year ago, has picked up sharply to hit an annual rate of 2.3% last month. Coupled with slow wage growth, this is restricting households\u2019 ability to spend. Next shares closed up 8% at \u00a341.99. Only 18 months ago they were changing hands at more than \u00a380. The company had previous warned that profits would fall. Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said it was \u201cnot a pretty set of figures from Next but no worse than expected after warning on profits in January.\u201d He added: \u201cInvestors seem to be reassured that it\u2019s taking steps to turn things around with a focus on core products.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Boss of British Gas owner gets 40% pay rise as millions live in fuel poverty", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of British Gas\u2019s parent company was handed a pay increase of nearly 40% last year, a raise Labour attacked as \u201castronomical\u201d and a \u201ckick in the teeth\u201d for millions of families living in fuel poverty. Centrica chief executive Iain Conn\u2019s remuneration jumped from \u00a33.02m in 2015 to \u00a34.15m in 2016, enough to pay the heating and lighting bills for nearly 4,000 customers on the company\u2019s standard tariff. The details of the rise come at a sensitive time for energy suppliers, just days after Theresa May said the energy market was \u201cmanifestly not working for all consumers\u201d. Government intervention, potentially in the form of a price cap, is seen as increasingly likely after five of the big six energy companies hiked prices. British Gas is the exception and has frozen prices until August, but experts expect the company will follow suit then because of rising cost pressures. Much of the increase in Conn\u2019s remuneration package is a \u00a31.4m \u201crecruitment award\u201d, compensation for rewards he forfeited when he joined Centrica in January 2015 after a 29-year career at BP. He also received a recruitment award last year of \u00a3632,000. His annual cash bonus rose by \u00a3178,000 to \u00a3759,000, but his \u00a3925,000 salary remained frozen. Centrica said it recognised the sensitivity of executive pay and was very careful to be in line with its peers. A spokeswoman said that in terms of financial performance, 2016 had been a very good year for the company, which posted an operating profit of \u00a31.5bn, up by 4% on 2015. Conn has said he firmly believes executive pay should be tied to performance. He told journalists last month: \u201cWhen I joined the company I was asked to take a reduction in the top-end of what I could earn and also asked to take a reduction in my base pay and make sure 80% of it was performance-related. I believe the company is very responsible in this area.\u201d Although shareholders approved his current package, some have expressed concerns about the one-off recruitment award. Conn, who earned \u00a33.36m at BP in 2013, has not quite reached the heights of his predecessor at Centrica, Sam Laidlaw, who earned nearly \u00a35m in 2012. Unlike Laidlaw, Conn is comfortable talking to the media and has been robust in arguing against calls for a price cap in the face of rising energy bills. \u201cA cap would almost certainly remove choice from the market,\u201d he told the Financial Times. He has also said government intervention risked simply redirecting consumer anger from companies to ministers. Labour reacted with anger to Conn\u2019s pay rise, and said it was the only party able to rein in excessive boardroom pay and help those struggling to pay their energy bills. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow energy secretary, said: \u201cOver 4 million people are living in fuel poverty across Britain so the announcement today of astronomical pay increases for certain energy company CEO\u2019s must feel like a kick in the teeth to those families who will sit shivering tonight because they cannot afford to put on the heating.

British Gas is the exception <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/10/scottish-power-customers-to-be-hit-by-78-price-hike\">and has frozen prices until August</a>, but experts expect the company will follow suit then because of rising cost pressures.</p> <p>Much of the increase in Conn\u2019s remuneration package is a \u00a31.4m \u201crecruitment award\u201d, compensation for rewards he forfeited when he joined Centrica in January 2015 after a 29-year career at BP. He also received a recruitment award last year of \u00a3632,000. His annual cash bonus rose by \u00a3178,000 to \u00a3759,000, but his \u00a3925,000 salary remained frozen.</p> <p>Centrica said it recognised the sensitivity of executive pay and was very careful to be in line with its peers. A spokeswoman said that in terms of financial performance, 2016 had been a very good year for the company, which posted an <a href=\"https://www.centrica.com/2016-prelim-results\">operating profit of \u00a31.5bn</a>, up by 4% on 2015.</p> <p>Conn has said he firmly believes executive pay should be tied to performance. He told journalists last month: \u201cWhen I joined the company I was asked to take a reduction in the top-end of what I could earn and also asked to take a reduction in my base pay and make sure 80% of it was performance-related. I believe the company is very responsible in this area.\u201d</p> <p>Although shareholders approved his current package, some have expressed concerns about the one-off recruitment award. </p> <p>Conn, who earned \u00a33.36m at BP in 2013, has not quite reached the heights of his predecessor at Centrica, Sam Laidlaw, who earned nearly \u00a35m in 2012.</p> <p>Unlike Laidlaw, Conn is comfortable talking to the media and has been robust in arguing against calls for a price cap in the face of rising energy bills. \u201cA cap would almost certainly remove choice from the market,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dad679c8-0951-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b\">he told the Financial Times</a>. He has also said government intervention risked simply redirecting consumer anger from companies to ministers.</p> <p>Labour reacted with anger to Conn\u2019s pay rise, and said it was the only party able to rein in excessive boardroom pay and help those struggling to pay their energy bills. </p> <p>Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow energy secretary, said: \u201cOver 4 million people are living in fuel poverty across Britain so the announcement today of astronomical pay increases for certain energy company CEO\u2019s must feel like a kick in the teeth to those families who will sit shivering tonight because they cannot afford to put on the heating.
