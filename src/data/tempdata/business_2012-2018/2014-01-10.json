    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The man who masterminded London's highly successful Olympic Games has said power blackouts would be \"the best possible thing\" because they would force politicians to confront the looming energy crisis. Sir John Armitt, who is also advising the Labour Party on Britain's infrastructure needs, said the country was heading towards an energy-capacity crunch because ministers had failed to ensure the construction of new power stations to take over from decommissioned nuclear and coal plants. And as Britain faces a weekend of freezing weather there were new warnings about the proximity of a capacity crunch from Dieter Helm, a leading energy academic who believes ministers have underestimated future power demand. Angry business leaders dismissed Armitt's comments as irresponsible, but Armitt, who worked on the Sizewell-B nuclear reactor while at the construction group Laing, insisted new capacity was needed. \"In harsh political terms [blackouts] would be the best possible thing that could happen because this country is extremely good in a crisis,\" he told the construction industry magazine Building. He added: \"We are very close to being in a crisis when it comes to energy \u2026 the Central Electricity Generating Board used to say that a resilient network operated on a 25% capacity surplus. We're down to 4% because we've gone slower than we should have done on nuclear.\" His warning was given new impetus by Helm, who cited calculations by the Aurora Energy Consultancy, which show surplus energy capacity in 2015-16 could be close to zero \u2013 leaving the nation on the cusp of blackouts. \"We know what the calculations are on the supply side because no new kit [power plants] will be built before 2015-16, but on the supply side all official estimates have underestimated GDP [gross domestic product] growth and therefore energy demand,\" said Helm, who is professor of energy policy at Oxford University. \"The government must be praying for another recession,\" he added, saying Britain faced a \"Spitfire moment\" when ministers should immediately intervene to ensure all energy capacity was available for use as soon as possible, with a particular emphasis on mothballed gas-fired power stations. The comments from Armitt, who is credited with rescuing Britain's rail infrastructure when he was chief executive of Network Rail, were rejected by the manufacturers' organisation EEF, as well as by the National Grid, which runs most of England's pipes and pylons, and the government. A spokesman for EEF said it shared Armitt's concern about the lack of investment in new energy infrastructure but said alarmist comments would not help. \"It is extremely irresponsible to say that a blackout would be a good thing. But obviously the government does need to tackle shrinking capacity with an emphasis on price and energy security. It should really prioritise reliable and flexible generation rather than intermittent power such as offshore wind,\" he said. A spokeswoman for the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change also dismissed talk of blackouts. \"Our priority is to keep the lights on both in the short and long term,\" said a spokeswoman. \"That is why we have legislated through the Energy Act 2013 to bring on the investment in new energy infrastructure that we need to replace power stations that are closing down. \"To increase security in the short-term, Ofgem and National Grid are consulting on the extension of measures that already exist to balance supply and demand. As a longer-term solution, we are introducing a Capacity Market in 2014 which will ensure new capacity is online by the winter of 2018-19.\" Tom Greatrex, shadow energy minister, said: \"Sir John Armitt is right to point out that the collapse in investment in clean energy since David Cameron became prime minister has put pressure on our energy infrastructure. \"Currently no single institution has responsibility for establishing our future energy needs or developing a strategy to meet them. The next Labour government will create a dedicated energy security board with statutory responsibility for providing advice to government and parliament on Britain's future energy needs and how best to meet them.\" The National Grid said it too agreed with Armitt that new investment was needed but said it believed the system could cope. \"Margins are tighter this year than in previous years, but our view is that the market has the capability to meet electricity and gas demand this winter,\" said a spokesman. \"We successfully managed similar levels back in 2008-08. We will continue to keep a watchful eye on the situation and take the necessary actions to keep the lights on.\" As a blast of Arctic weather was set to sweep in, Mark Todd, director of the price comparison site energyhelpline.com, urged customers to search for cheaper suppliers. \"Thermometers are set to take a plunge this weekend as Britain enters a period of chilly Arctic weather, forcing households to turn up their heating. \"Customers ought to think about preparing for the cold weather ahead by switching their energy tariff now to avoid crippling energy bills,\" he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A generation ago the idea of allowing a fast-action form of electronic roulette to be played and promoted in bookmakers' shops across the land would have been regarded as absurd. Roulette is a fixed-odds game and the prevailing wisdom of a couple of centuries held that such casino games should be confined to casinos. There even used to be a \"24-hour rule\" on casino membership to ensure applicants, even millionaires, had time to cool off. That social arrangement worked reasonably well. Libertarian principles, including the right to risk your money on a game of chance, were respected. So, too, was the sensible idea that roulette, when played for potentially high stakes, should not be treated as an everyday pastime. It is impossible for a persistent player to beat the odds. The house's edge is small but set in stone. How Britain got into a position where there are now 33,000 electronic roulette wheels, coyly called fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), in bookmakers' shops is well documented. Initially, it was almost by accident. In 2001 the Labour government abolished betting duty and introduced a tax on profits. That made low-margin games such as roulette viable for the operator. The bookies got around the rule that no betting was allowed on events hosted in their shops by arguing that the \"event\" \u2013 the drop of the ball \u2013 was taking place on a server elsewhere. Then parliament in 2005, in the midst of Labour ministers' brief and bizarre love-in with casinos, decided a limit of four FOBTs per shop would be a pragmatic fudge. Now FOBTs have come to dominate bookies' premises and complaints are rife. Spend time in a bookies and you can understand why. The shops have become charmless places dominated by flashing machines that each earn about \u00a3900 a week, on average, at no financial risk whatsoever to the operator. Only a small minority of players may be so-called \"problem gamblers,\" or even small-time drug dealers laundering cash. But FOBTs are light years away from traditional forms of betting. As Greg Wood, this paper's racing correspondent, put it this week, they are about \"the mechanical extraction of money,\" often from depressed neighbourhoods. Bookmakers are earning about \u00a31.5bn a year from FOBTs. Ladbrokes makes almost half its UK retail profits from the machines. Finally, it is dawning on politicians that FOBTs, despite the tax receipts, may be a social ill. Ed Miliband has swallowed any embarrassment over Labour's past stupidity and wants councils to have new powers to control their spread. David Cameron promises to \"get to grips\" with the problem. Let's hope he does. Just as we now demand that banks concentrate on banking, rather than gouging their customers with useless products, it is reasonable to expect high-street bookies to focus on honest bookmaking rather than games of chance. The objections to reform are feeble. The internet, it is said, is awash with casino games. Yes, but many things happen on the internet that we wouldn't wish to see promoted on high streets. And the plea that FOBTs are no less addictive than other forms of gambling is simply naive. Most regular gamblers will confirm there's a world of difference between playing a touch-screen roulette wheel that spins every 20 seconds and having a flutter on the 3.30 at Ripon or taking a punt on England's next batting collapse. Shareholders in William Hill, Ladbrokes et al would be losers if FOBTs were to be banned, or their size of stake massively reduced from a maximum \u00a3100. Those investors have had a good run; they should count their blessings. The real losers would be shop staff since, as JP Morgan's analyst wrote this week, \"over time, the viability of the UK retail estates could come into question\". The welfare of staff is a legitimate worry for politicians but doesn't alter the basic point. Roulette is best played in casinos, or, given 21st century realities, at home. Allowing it on every high street was a mistake that should be reversed. But then not all gambling is bad \u2026 By way of demonstration that the above should not be taken as a wild-eyed rant against betting in general, it's time to report on this column's modest wager from a year ago. It was 7-2 at Paddy Power that Ocado's shares would outperform Tesco's in 2013. That seemed remarkably generous for a contest with only two runners. So it proved. Ocado's shares rose fivefold; Tesco's fell. The \u00a370 winnings go to the Guardian and Observer Christmas appeal. Standard practice or conspiracy? \"It was totally my decision to leave,\" says Richard Meddings, no longer heir-apparent to Standard Chartered chief executive Peter Sands. \"After 11 years on the board of this bank and seven years as finance director it seems a natural time to step away.\" Fair enough, he's entitled to his New Year resolution to do something else. But, if this version of events is the full ticket, why do the members of Standard Chartered's pay committee think Meddings, aged 55 and thus not at the end of his career, should be allowed to keep a bucket-load of unvested incentive shares that are supposedly designed to encourage valued executives to stay at their posts? \"The committee has ... decided, given Richard's track record of performance over more than 10 years, to confer good leaver status to allow him to retain any unvested share awards,\" says the bank. At the current share price, that act of generosity is worth about \u00a38m to Meddings, who could hardly complain about being badly paid in the first place. Not just Standard, but standard, practice at big banks some might argue. Really? The handout will encourage the widely-held suspicion in the City that an almighty boardroom row, rather than Meddings' personal epiphany, is the real story. Choose your own conspiracy theory. Is Meddings the fall-guy for Standard's \u00a3415m US fine in 2012 for sanctions-busting in Iran? Was there a row over Standard's need for fresh capital? Had the relationship between Sands and Meddings collapsed? Did the two men disagree over the bank's decision to merge its wholesale and consumer divisions, a shuffle that has seen wholesale boss Mike Rees handed the new post of deputy chief executive? All of those theories look more plausible than the notion that Meddings just fancied a change. Three years ago HSBC denied there was a boardroom bust-up right until the moment two senior heads rolled. JP Morgan should have spotted the Ponzi Still JP Morgan's collection of fines and settlements grows. The total is now an astonishing $29bn (\u00a317bn) over the past three years after this week's $2bn settlement related to Bernie Madoff, above. The bank failed to tell US authorities about suspicions that now-convicted fraudster's investment returns might be \"too good to be true\". The US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, with a would-be whistleblower banging on its door, was also asleep on the job. But JP Morgan, as Madoff's banker, was in a unique position to spot the Ponzi scheme. The fact that staff in various divisions had concerns going back to 1998 gives the affair its sting. Naturally, no JP Morgan executives were accused of wrongdoing. Thus shareholders will merely see yet another unfortunate episode from the past. Thus nobody of seniority, and certainly not chairman and chief executive Jamie Dimon, will feel obliged to offer a resignation. That's usually the way at JP Morgan.",

      "bodyText": "A shortage of bricks and bricklayers has been highlighted as a threat to the construction sector's recovery after new figures revealed a surprise drop in output.

The supermarket chain, based in Bradford, had earlier in the week issued a profits warning after a dire Christmas in which underlying sales slumped 5.6%. It is hoping that its move online will deliver much needed growth. Dalton Philips, the chief executive, personally delivered the first order at 5.30am in a bright yellow Morrisons-liveried van, part of a fleet being run by Ocado, the online grocery specialist that is providing the logistical backbone for the service.

Philips said Morrisons' lack of an online service was partly to blame for its poor Christmas, when many more shoppers opted for the convenience of home delivery. But he admitted that at least half the chain's fall in sales was the result of shoppers opting to buy more from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl than at previous Christmases. Morrisons was clearly attempting to fight back against that tide as it advertised price cuts on basics, including bananas and bread. Clive Black, a retail analyst at Shore Capital, said: \"Such a move is significant to our minds as it is the most tangible indication for some time that Morrisons is going to more aggressively and directly take on the hard discounters.\"",

The report said the unemployment rate had dropped to to 6.7% in December, but the fall was explained almost entirely by people giving up on their search for work.</p> <p>Only 62.8% of the adult workforce participated in the jobs market in December, down 0.2 percentage points from the previous month.

Other reports had indicated strong growth in the market and there are wider signs that the US\u2019s economy is strengthening.

That would be nearly as strong as November's robust gain of 203,000. The unemployment rate is forecast to remain at a five-year low of 7 percent.</p> <p>The Labor Department will release the December employment report at 1330 GMT Friday.</p> <p>From August through November, the economy added an average of 204,000 jobs a month. Another month of 200,000 or so new jobs would suggest that employers are hiring at a sustained pace. That's what policymakers and job hunters have hoped for since the Great Recession ended more than 4\u00bd years ago.</p> <p>\"I think the economy's finally moving into third gear here,\" said Ethan Harris, global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p> <p>Steady job gains were a big reason the Federal Reserve decided last month to cut back on its monthly bond purchases, which are intended to lower long-term loan rates to stimulate spending and growth. The U.S. central bank is paring its bond buying to $75 billion a month from $85 billion. It is likely to further reduce its pace of purchases if the strong job gains continue.</p> <p>Recent data have painted a picture of an economy on the steady rise. Exports hit a record level in November, lowering the U.S. trade deficit. Businesses have ordered more manufactured goods. Auto sales reached a six-year high in 2013.</p> <p>Analysts now estimate that the economy expanded at a healthy annual rate of 3 percent to 3.5 percent in the October-December quarter. That's up from earlier forecasts of a 2 percent rate or less. It would follow a strong 4.1 percent growth rate reported for the July-September quarter.<br> If the economists' forecasts are accurate, the U.S. economy will have gained 2.27 million jobs in 2013 the most since 2005.</p> <p>Still, there have been some hints that last month might have been weaker than expected. The number of people seeking unemployment benefits spiked in December, which suggests that layoffs rose.</p> <p>Economists caution that those figures might have been distorted by the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, which can create unusual spikes in temporary job cuts. Applications for unemployment benefits have fallen back to pre-recession levels in the past two weeks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52cfe8b1e4b06a3ace5301a4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-10T12:53:15.306Z\">12.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Britain's Cineworld chain</strong> is becoming Europe's second-largest cinema operator, after pulling off the takeover of&#xa0;Cinema City International.</p> <p>The deal gives Cineworld a platform in&#xa0;seven countries in central and eastern Europe and Israel.</p> <p>Here's the story:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/10/cineworld-merger-europe-second-biggest-cinema-chain\"><strong>Cineworld merger widens vision as Europe's second biggest cinema chain</strong></a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52cfe167e4b06a3ace5301a2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-01-10T12:17:42.889Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Schroders: UK growth slowed</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Azad Zangana, European economist at Schroders</strong>, believes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/10/china-becomes-worlds-biggest-goods-trader-us-jobs-report-business-live#block-52cfc3ebe4b0ef9175134dbe\">today's disappointing UK manufacturing data</a> shows that economic growth slowed at the end of 2013.</p> <p>Schroders predicts that&#xa0;fourth-quarter GDP growth slowed to 0.5%, from the chunky 0.8% rise recorded for July-September.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At this stage, we believe the slowdown is in reaction to the weak demand in the previous quarter and the subsequent build-up of inventories.

Both industrial production and manufacturing output were unchanged on October\u2019s level. This suggests that overall production in the fourth quarter as a whole is likely to have grown by about 0.6% or 0.7% on the previous quarter. While this would fall short of the stellar 2% quarterly growth rates indicated by the CIPS and CBI industrial surveys, at least it would match the third quarter\u2019s 0.6% expansion. Provided, then, that growth in services output has not slowed \u2013 which looks unlikely given the surveys \u2013 Q4 GDP growth should at least match Q3\u2019s 0.8% gain. And looking ahead, with a recovery in real incomes set to support further growth in consumer spending and signs that firms are gearing up to invest, 2014 should be a year of continued expansion in industrial production.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's <strong>Chris Williamson of Markit</strong> (whose PMI surveys have been very positive recently)</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWeaker than expected output of the industrial sector and a surprise drop in construction industry output in November suggests fourth quarter economic growth could come in lower than the surveys are indicating.

      "bodyText": "Despite the confusing picture painted by the US non-farm payroll numbers, investors were in a positive mood at the end of the first full trading week of the year, writes Nick Fletcher. Michael van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets said: {There will be} much discussion now whether the improvement in unemployment rate supports the US central bank\u2019s plans to taper [its $75bn a month bond buying programme] or whether it will hold off from another measured reduction in January to see if December was an anomaly. Maybe today\u2019s data will see tapering paused immediately before it really even gets started. We expected at least one pause in 2014 but not this early. With plenty of contradictory Fed member comments to come along with more inevitable poor data we\u2019re unlikely to have seen the last of 2013\u2019s taper-on/taper-off. Are you ready for the 2014 version: taper-pause/taper resume? But overall, with strong Chinese trade data and continuing hopes for a eurozone recovery, the markets moved higher: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished up 48.60 or 0.73% at 6739.94 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.55% to 9473.24 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.6% better at 4250.60 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB rose 0.34% to 19,569.00 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 0.55% higher at 10,290.6 But on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has slipped 34 points or 0.21%. And on that note, it's time to finish for the evening and the week. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back next week. Have a good weekend. A bit of ratings agency action: Back in America, the president of the Richmond Federal Reserve has predicted that the Fed will not be swayed by one month's poor jobs data. Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker told reporters that he expects policymakers to discuss another $10bn tapering at their meeting later this month.. Reuters has the quotes: \"I would expect a similar reduction in pace to be discussed at the upcoming meeting,\" Lacker told reporters.\"It takes a lot more than one labor market report to be convincing that the trend has shifted and in my experience one employment report rarely has an effect by itself on monetary policy.\" Over in Latvia, Eurocrats are celebrating its entry into the eurozone. European Council president Herman van Rompuy is claiming that Latvia's arrival shows that \"vitality\" of the euro. Lithuania will be next, he declared a few moments ago (speech online here): Only twelve years after the first introduction of euro banknotes and coins, the euro zone now has eighteen members and 333 million Europeans sharing the same currency. And I expect Lithuania to join already next year as the 19th member and completing the Baltic euro accession. In addition, the euro is the second most traded currency in the world and alongside the US dollar it is the most important reserve currency. Not bad for a 12 year old! Let's remember, though, that ECB president Mario Draghi warned yesterday that it's too early to declare the end of the eurozone debt crisis..... Capital Economics, though, reckons the Federal Reserve will not be alarmed that just 74,000 new jobs were created last month, given the bad weather. We suspect that the unexpectedly weak 74,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in December is largely explained by the unseasonably severe winter weather last month. Under those circumstances, we still expect the Fed to reduce its monthly asset purchases by a further $10bn at the upcoming FOMC meeting later this month, particularly with the unemployment rate dropping to a five-year low of 6.7%. Rob Carnell of ING says the US jobs report looks \"really bad, with some good bits\", making it generally \"baffling\". In short, the figures look too inconsistent with other data to be taken too literally. We have become used to smaller fluctuations in payrolls payrolls in recent years, but we suspect that much of the weakness of this month\u2019s figures will turn out to be simply noise, and will be reversed in the months ahead. For all the volatility of the components leading to the unemployment rate calculation, the trend decline there is hard to ignore. Carnell reckons there's less chance that the Federal Reserve will cut a second $10bn off its stimulus programme at this month's meeting: Nevertheless, following the initial shock, both markets and the Fed will likely be inclined to wait for confirmation on the payrolls data, and a refutation of the declines in the unemployment rate before throwing the towel in on the US recovery story. The recovery in the US jobs market came to a grinding halt in December as businesses added just 74,000 new jobs, the lowest rise since January 2011, writes Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe: The report from the US Department of Labor shocked economists on Friday who had been expecting the number to increase by at least 200,000. The report said the unemployment rate had dropped to to 6.7% in December, but the fall was explained almost entirely by people giving up on their search for work. Only 62.8% of the adult workforce participated in the jobs market in December, down 0.2 percentage points from the previous month. It was the lowest participation rate \u2013 the number of people employed or actively looking for work \u2013 since the 1970s. The sluggish growth in jobs was surprising. Other reports had indicated strong growth in the market and there are wider signs that the US\u2019s economy is strengthening. The Labor Department even revised up its estimate of jobs growth for November, reporting a confirmed rise of 241,000, up from an initial estimate of 203,000. It said 200,000 jobs were added in October. The retail sector added the most jobs, at 55,000. Jobs were also gained in professional and business services, up 19,000, manufacturing, which added 9,000, and mining, which added 5,000. But weakness in the jobs market spread through a number of industries; information and construction lost jobs, the government shed jobs and in total, the service sector added just 90,000 jobs, well below the previous month\u2019s figure of 175,000. Here's the full story: US unemployment rate drops to 6.7% but businesses add just 74,000 jobs No panic on Wall Street. The Dow Jones index has inched up in early trading, currently 27 points or 0.16% higher at 16,471. There's also bad news on the jobs front from Canada, where 45,900 jobs were lost last month. Statistics Canada reported that 60,000 full time workers lost their jobs in December, partly balanced by 15,000 new temporary hires. December brought bad weather to Canada. A massive ice storm brought down trees and power lines, leaving hundreds of thousands of people with heat and electricity in the run-up to Christmas. Sebastien Galy of Societe Generale is concerned that more jobs were lost than anticipated: While the weather effect may explain some of the US data, leaving workers technically out of the workforce, Canada\u2019s economists are presumably better used to shutdown linked to cold weather. I remember quite well Hydro Quebec\u2019s electric lines collapsing under the weight of ice in the 1990s. What is interesting is that temporary employment didn\u2019t pick up. You need a significant amount of labour to clean-up the snow. The club rugby guys hit the road and the shovel if my days are any good memory. Full time employment was hit by the closure of plants in Ontario, but we can presume that Canadian economists can count beans so that it might be something more worrying. There are plenty of economists on both sides of the pond with red faces, after followers of the 'dismal science' made a hash of predicting today's US jobs data. Here's an example: Bad weather in America last month is being blamed for putting a freeze on weak job creation, flags up Phil Izzo of the Wall Street Journal. Analyst Lorcan Roche Kelly, and Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets, both reckon the Federal Reserve will resist cutting its quantitative easing programme again at this month's meeting: And the US government debt is strengthening in value, suggesting that investors think there's less chance that the Federal Reserve will cut its bond-buying stimulus plan again this month. This has pushed down the yield, or interest rate, on its debt by 6 basis points to 2.90% from 2.96%. Shares came off their best levels in Europe, and gold gained in value, after the weaker than expected US jobs data, writes our markets reporter, Nick Fletcher: With non-farm payrolls rising by 74,000 in December compared to expectations of 177,000, the FTSE 100 - up around 76 points ahead of the figures - fell back to 6747.14, a rise of 55.80 points. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was forecast to open down 35 point compared to a 55 points rise predicted ahead of the jobs report. Gold rose by 1.3% to $1,243 an ounce, while the pound climbed to $1.6456 from $1.6404 before the data. The US labour force participation rate fell in December, from 63.0% to 62.8% -- the lowest rate in over 30 years, according to reports. That shows more Americans dropped out of the employment market during the month, helping to pull down the unemployment rate. This is the smallest number of new jobs created across US economy in one month since January 2011. Quite the opposite of what Wall Street had expected. BREAKING: Just 74,000 new jobs were created in the US last month, according to the Non-Farm payroll. That's much smaller than economists had expected (the consensus was 197,000). However, November's NFP has been revised UP - from 203,000 to 241,000. And the US jobless rate has fallen to just 6.7%, down from 7%. Lots to digest here.... This Non-Farm Payroll is a biggie, says Bloomberg TV - with the chance that the US jobless rate could fall below 7%.... Right, nearly time for the big economic number of the day -- how many new jobs were created in America last month? The US Non-Farm Payroll is issued in seven minutes time, and Wall Street economists are expecting a decent number of around 200,000. The unemployment rate could also fall. European stock markets have rallied today in anticipation of a bumper NFP. The bigger the number, the more chance that the US Federal Reserve keeps cutting its bond-buying stimulus programme.... Here's Associated Press preview: Healthy U.S. economic growth in the second half of last year has raised expectations that 2013 ended with a fifth straight month of solid hiring. Economists predict that employers added 196,000 jobs last month, according to a survey by FactSet. That would be nearly as strong as November's robust gain of 203,000. The unemployment rate is forecast to remain at a five-year low of 7 percent. The Labor Department will release the December employment report at 1330 GMT Friday. From August through November, the economy added an average of 204,000 jobs a month. Another month of 200,000 or so new jobs would suggest that employers are hiring at a sustained pace. That's what policymakers and job hunters have hoped for since the Great Recession ended more than 4\u00bd years ago. \"I think the economy's finally moving into third gear here,\" said Ethan Harris, global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Steady job gains were a big reason the Federal Reserve decided last month to cut back on its monthly bond purchases, which are intended to lower long-term loan rates to stimulate spending and growth. The U.S. central bank is paring its bond buying to $75 billion a month from $85 billion. It is likely to further reduce its pace of purchases if the strong job gains continue. Recent data have painted a picture of an economy on the steady rise. Exports hit a record level in November, lowering the U.S. trade deficit. Businesses have ordered more manufactured goods. Auto sales reached a six-year high in 2013. Analysts now estimate that the economy expanded at a healthy annual rate of 3 percent to 3.5 percent in the October-December quarter. That's up from earlier forecasts of a 2 percent rate or less. It would follow a strong 4.1 percent growth rate reported for the July-September quarter. If the economists' forecasts are accurate, the U.S. economy will have gained 2.27 million jobs in 2013 the most since 2005. Still, there have been some hints that last month might have been weaker than expected. The number of people seeking unemployment benefits spiked in December, which suggests that layoffs rose. Economists caution that those figures might have been distorted by the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, which can create unusual spikes in temporary job cuts. Applications for unemployment benefits have fallen back to pre-recession levels in the past two weeks. Britain's Cineworld chain is becoming Europe's second-largest cinema operator, after pulling off the takeover of Cinema City International. The deal gives Cineworld a platform in seven countries in central and eastern Europe and Israel. Here's the story: Cineworld merger widens vision as Europe's second biggest cinema chain Azad Zangana, European economist at Schroders, believes today's disappointing UK manufacturing data shows that economic growth slowed at the end of 2013. Schroders predicts that fourth-quarter GDP growth slowed to 0.5%, from the chunky 0.8% rise recorded for July-September. At this stage, we believe the slowdown is in reaction to the weak demand in the previous quarter and the subsequent build-up of inventories. The slowdown in activity will help reduce those excess inventories; however, we only expect to see a slight acceleration in growth in the first quarter of this year. And that means UK interest rates probably won't rise until 2016, Zangana predicts Supermarket chain Morrisons has boldly entered the 21st Century with its first ever delivery of shopping ordered over that new-fangled Internet thingie (it'll probably never catch on...). Chief executive Dalton Phillips performed the inaugural drop, a day after hitting shareholders with a mini-profit warning. Morrison's suffered sliding sales in the run-up to Christmas, partly because it has failed to join the online shopping race. John Lewis has reinforced its reputation as one of the winners of the Christmas, reporting a surge in sales in over the new year period. Takings across its department stores were up 23.6% in the week to 4th January, as bargain hunters jostled in the lighting, home accessories and gift aisles. As my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports, its supermarket arm also enjoyed a good week: At Waitrose, New Year resolutions appeared to be kicking into full swing, as customers filled their baskets with vegetables, porridge oats and green tea. Sales of kale, the so-called super vegetable, currently flavour of the month with health-conscious celebrities, were up 58% on last year, while spinach sales rose 13%, garlic 15% and Savoy cabbage 17%. Sushi sales were reported to be up 343%. Here's the story: John Lewis claims 'cracking' post-Christmas sales up 23% Back on China, here's our news story on the country's charge to the top of the global trade rankings: China surpasses US as world's largest trading nation Beijing describes 2013 figures as 'a landmark milestone' as annual trade in good passes the $4tn mark for the first time Europe's stock markets have turned higher, with traders anticipating a strong US employment report in just over two hour's time. The FTSE 100 has rallied near 1%, with most mining stocks rising following the news that China's imports jumped strongly in December (see opening post). Toby Morris of CMC Markets explains: A surge in Chinese imports has provided a welcome boost for the miners this morning, who trade higher despite the news of a whopping $1.7bln impairment for Aluminium giant Alcoa, reported just after the closing bell yesterday. The import data gives China the mantle of the world\u2019s biggest trader of goods and helps to dampen concerns over the outlook for growth amid key economic reform. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), has warned that the UK recovery is not secure. With Britain's manufacturing and industrial production stalling in November, there's no reason to raise borrowing costs yet (a point he also made yesterday). Although longer-term comparisons show solid annual growth, these monthly figures are disappointing. It is a timely reminder that the recovery is not yet secure, and should also dampen the clamour for an early rise in interest rates. The government must continue to implement measures to boost growth, to ensure that the UK economy is on firmer ground before any such step is introduced. Our economics reporter Katie Allen has analysed today's disappointing UK manufacturing data, and reports: Official figures have poured some cold water on hopes that the UK\u2019s economic recovery gathered steam in the final quarter of 2013. Manufacturers and the wider industrial sector failed to clock up any growth in November, defying forecasts for modest growth. Meanwhile construction output fell sharply, according to the data from the Office for National Statistics. The ONS said output in the manufacturing sector, which makes up a tenth of the economy, was unchanged in November, marking the weakest performance since August. Economists in a Reuters poll had forecast growth of 0.4%. The wider industrial sector, which also includes utilities and mining, was also flat, again defying forecasts for a 0.4% increase in output. Output in the construction sector, around 6% of the economy, was estimated to have fallen 4% on the month, its biggest drop since June 2012. The ONS said both sub-sectors of construction contributed to the monthly drop with new work falling 3.9% and repair &amp; maintenance by 4.2%. James Knightley at ING Financial Markets comments: \u201cTaking all these reports together, it suggests 4Q13 GDP is likely to come in just below 1%QoQ rather than just above.\u201d Samuel Tombs at Capital Economics added: \u201cNovember\u2019s weak industrial production figures signal that GDP growth in the fourth quarter is unlikely to be quite as strong as the business surveys have indicated. Both industrial production and manufacturing output were unchanged on October\u2019s level. This suggests that overall production in the fourth quarter as a whole is likely to have grown by about 0.6% or 0.7% on the previous quarter. While this would fall short of the stellar 2% quarterly growth rates indicated by the CIPS and CBI industrial surveys, at least it would match the third quarter\u2019s 0.6% expansion. Provided, then, that growth in services output has not slowed \u2013 which looks unlikely given the surveys \u2013 Q4 GDP growth should at least match Q3\u2019s 0.8% gain. And looking ahead, with a recovery in real incomes set to support further growth in consumer spending and signs that firms are gearing up to invest, 2014 should be a year of continued expansion in industrial production.\u201d And here's Chris Williamson of Markit (whose PMI surveys have been very positive recently) \u201cWeaker than expected output of the industrial sector and a surprise drop in construction industry output in November suggests fourth quarter economic growth could come in lower than the surveys are indicating. Nevertheless, the economy remains firmly in recovery mode, and a rebound from this current bout of weakness looks likely in coming months.\u201d Oh dear - Britain's industrial sector failed to grow its output in November. The ONS just reported that manufacturing and industrial production were both flat month-on month in November, which surprised economists who expected a 0.4% rise. More to follow.... More good news for the eurozone -- new manufacturing data from Spanish shows a 2.6% jump in industrial output in November, on an annual basis. That shows a bounce-back from October's 1.3% decline. While AFP's Juergen Baetz isn't surprised that Germany has kept its AAA credit rating (see 8.50am). Economist Shaun Richards agrees that the French manufacturing data is more encouraging than the monthly PMI surveys: Is the French economy doing better than we feared, and fending off the risk of a new slump? The latest manufacturing data, released this morning, have beaten expectations -- with industrial output jumping by 1.3% month-on-month in December. That's smashed forecasts of a 0.4% rise. The wider measure of manufacturing output also rose, by 0.2%, according to INSEE, led by higher activity in mining and quarrying; energy; water supply; waste management; transport equipment; and coke production (here's the full report). The news came as the French central bank reiterated that it expects the country's economic output increased by 0.5% in the final quarter of 2013. That would avert a new recession (GDP fell by 0.1% in the third-quarter). This graph, via IG's Stan Shamu, shows how China's exports have been growing pretty steadily since the shock of the 2008 financial crisis. Germany saw its AAA credit rating reaffirmed by Standard &amp; Poor's this morning. S&amp;P also maintained a 'stable' rating on Germany, saying Europe's largest economy was well-placed to handle any shocks: The ratings on Germany reflect our view of its modern, highly diversified, and competitive economy, and the government's track record of prudent fiscal policies and expenditure discipline. Furthermore, we believe the German economy has demonstrated its ability to absorb large economic and financial shocks. The European stock markets have all risen in early trading, after today's Chinese trade data showed an 8.3% jump in imports last month. The FTSE 100 is up 32 points at 6724, a gain of 0.5%, while the Spanish and Italian markets lead the way, up around 0.7%. Investor confidence in the eurozone periphery appears to be growing.... Some economists are critical of the quality of China's economic data, suggesting it can be distorted by political pressure and the sheer challenge of tracking activity across the country. Companies can also invent exports as a way of circumventing controls on cross-border transactions -- something Beijing has been clamping down on. Sun Junwei, China economist at HSBC in Beijing, reckons the record-breaking figures announced today are probably more reliable than before, saying: Recent measures could be working to squeeze out these fake trade activities. We actually think these activities would be relatively contained this year compared with last year. Rajiv Biswas, chief economist Asia-Pacific at IHS, predicts that the gap between the overall trade of China and the US will probably be close to $250bn. \"That is a significant difference and it is unlikely that any adjustment to the final figures will alter the position of the two countries.\" That's via BBC News. I mentioned in the opening post that China's trade surplus for December shrank by more than expected -- well, IG's Stan Shamu calls it a \"high-quality miss\" While the headline reading was weak, it was a high quality miss once dissected. Imports were up 8.3%, smashing expectations of 5% and showing the second highest nominal reading ever recorded. While exports missed estimates at +4.3% (versus +5% expected), the value of exports was the highest ever recorded. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the global economy, the eurozone, and the business world. We start with the news that China has overtaken the US to become the world's biggest trading nation, according to figures released in Beijing earlier today. China's annual trade in goods passed the $4trn (\u00a32.4trn) mark for the first time in 2013, up 7.6% after another year of rising imports and exports. And with America having traded $3.57tn in the first 11 months of last year, it means China is extremely confident it has claimed the crown. Zheng Yuesheng, spokesman for China's Customs administration, declared: It is very likely that China overtook the US to become the world's largest trading country in goods in 2013 for the first time. adding: This is a landmark milestone for our nation\u2019s foreign trade development. China overtook the US despite its economic growth slowing last year, and in the face of Europe's economic woes and some turbulence in emerging markets. Some reports have suggested China had taken the top spot a year earlier -- but Yuesheng says this is the first data that proves it. Is it the first time ever, though? Possibly not -- the Financial Times delves back into the archives: Some historians argue China was the world\u2019s largest trading nation during the Qing dynasty (which lasted from 1644-1912) despite the ambivalence of Chinese emperors toward foreign trade. Either way, definitely a moment in China's economic history. China's biggest trading partner was the EU, followed by America, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), Hong Kong and Japan. Today's data also showed that exports were up just 4.3% year-on-year in December, while imports rose 8.3%. Analysts suggested a clampdown on dodgy speculative trading disguised as exports was to blame. This meant that China's trade surplus in December fell 17.4% to $25.64bn (\u00a315.5bn), smaller than expected. But seen positively, it could suggest the country is rebalancing away from exports and towards more consumption (I'll post some analyst reaction shortly). Coming up.... The trade data comes hours before the released of America's employment data for December. Analysts expect a pretty decent number, with perhaps more than 200,000 new jobs created across the US last month. Stock markets are expected to rise a little this morning ahead of the data, which is released at 1.30pm GMT (8.30am on the East Coast). We also have the latest UK Christmas trading figures to chew through -- with John Lewis and JD Sports both upbeat (more shortly). And we'll also have an eye on Greece, as usual. I'll be tracking all the action through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Widespread flooding is never good news for insurers, of course, but that was not the only problem washing over RSA Insurance. Following news late last year of accounting irregularities in its Irish business, RSA tried to draw a line under the scandal on Thursday by releasing a report by PwC which concluded it was an isolated incident, albeit one which will cost the insurer \u00a3200m. A number of executive heads subsequently rolled, and RSA is considering legal action against its former auditor Deloitte. The black hole in its finances meant RSA's dividend was already under threat, and analysts believe it will have to raise some \u00a3450m, either with a cash call or by selling assets. So the floods could hardly have come at a worse time, and chairman Martin Scicluna admitted the severe weather would put more pressure on its profits and its payout to shareholders. The group issued three profit warnings in the six weeks before Christmas, partly due to the Irish problems, and analyst Barrie Cornes at Panmure Gordon reckoned the storms could knock another \u00a335m off earnings. However the insurer's problems also reignited speculation it could face a takeover bid, with analysts tipping Aviva or a consortium led by Scandanavia's Sampo as possible predators. So despite its troubles, RSA's share ended at 98.35p on Friday, up 0.4p on the day and 6.2p on the week. Overall, leading shares ended the first full trading week of 2014 on a positive note, as investors pinned their hopes on a global recovery continuing in the new year. There were no surprises from the latest meetings of the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, while a successful Irish bond auction helped sentiment towards the eurozone as a whole. Chinese trade data on Friday showing the country overtaking the US was also taken as a positive sign. But unexpectedly weak US non-farm payrolls took some of the shine off, with analysts saying the figures reduced the chances of the US Federal Reserve cutting back its $75bn a month bond buying programme again in the near future. The FTSE 100 finished at 6739.94, up 48.60 points on the day and around 9 points higher on the week. Retailers were in the spotlight, with poor Christmas trading updates from Tesco, Morrisons, and Mothercare among others. Tesco lost 2.55p to 321.80p on Friday as HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Barclays all cut their price target but Morrisons recovered 1.6p to 236.1p after earlier falls. But Mothercare lost another 10.75p to 274.25p, a 153p slump on the week. But Burberry added 52p to \u00a314.73 after the positive trade figures from China on Friday and a report from Swatch, which owns luxury brands like Omega and Breguet, that it expected strong growth this year, dampening fears of slowdown in emerging markets. Mining shares were also lifted by the day's strong trade data from China, a key consumer of commodities. Glencore Xstrata added 9.1p to 318.75p while Rio Tinto rose 25p to \u00a331.40, BHP Billiton was 8.5p better at 1780.5p and Anglo American added 23p to 1249.5p. Tullow Oil was the biggest riser in the leading index on Friday, up 64.5p at 909.5p on speculation that Norway's Statoil could be circling. The company's shares had been on the slide after a series of disappointments, which analysts said could leave it vulnerable to a takeover. Housebuilders were in demand after a positive trading update earlier in the week from Persimmon, up 80p at \u00a313.54 as HSBC raised its profit estimates for 2013 to 2016 by 5%-17% and its target price from \u00a313.95 to \u00a315. Taylor Wimpey added 5.8p to 120p while Bovis Homes rose 35.5p to 850p. But banks fell back after the Financial Conduct Authority said they had only paid out a fraction of the \u00a33bn set aside to compensate small firms mis-sold interest-rate hedging products. Lloyds Banking Group lost 2.22p to 83.04p, Royal Bank of Scotland dropped 3.3p to 356.9p and Barclays fell 0.8p to 283.6p. Standard Chartered, which was on the slide on Thursday after the surprise departure of finance director Richard Meddings, recovered 3p to 1286.5p. But Berenberg analysts repeated a sell recommendation on the bank, which also announced the merger of its wholesale and consumer divisions. Berenberg said: A month after a poor trading update and two months after the strategy day a new group structure has surprisingly been announced. The conference call to explain these changes left us, and seemingly the market, even more concerned that there are deeper issues. Uncertainties about capital and now strategy/management will cause Standard Chartered to trade at an increased discount to peers, in our view. These issues need to be resolved before we would want exposure to [the bank]. Arm lost 25.5p to 972p. On Thursday Deutsche Bank reduced its recommendation from buy to hold, and a day later Goldman Sachs removed the chip maker from its conviction buy list. The bank kept the company as a buy but lowered its earnings per share forecasts by 6% for 2014 and 4% for 2015. It said: We lower our near-term forecasts to reflect: 1) the continuing inventory correction in Smartphones (also echoed in profit warnings from HTC and Samsung), impacting our near-term Royalty forecasts; 2) latest currency movements, as stronger sterling represents a source of lower reported growth; and 3) our view that Arm's licensing pipeline (reflected in a 60% backlog increase over the past two years and a 45% revenue increase) is driving additional hiring at Arm, increasing our operating expenditure forecasts. Outsourcing group Capita climbed 21p to \u00a310.43 after UBS moved from neutral to buy, while among the mid-caps Homeserve is up 15.8p to 274.8p after a recommendation from the same bank. On Capita UBS said: While some sector peers saw tough trading in 2013 as a result of issues with the UK government, Capita was not impacted and had secured \u00a32.9bn of major contracts when it reported its November interim management statement, down on the record \u00a34bn in 2012, but well above the \u00a31bn- \u00a32bn long-term average. We see almost 6% of our 8% forecast 2014 organic growth as already underpinned and expect good contract news momentum to continue in the near term. In a generally positive note on the oil sector, analysts at Exane BNP Paribas have raised their rating on Royal Dutch Shell, on the prospects of improvement under its new chief executive, but reduced their recommendation on BP. Exane moved from neutral to outperform on Shell, whose A shares climbed 45p to \u00a321.90, saying: We see the arrival of Ben Van Beurden as chief executive as an opportunity for the market to reassess Shell. While we see Beurden bringing continuity - we do not see scope for a strategic revolution - we do believe that the combination of more active disposals, a more shareholder friendly approach with increasing distributions and more capital discipline could get the stock going. But on BP, up 1.7p to 497p, it said: The BP story remains anchored around (1) a sustained improvement in cashflow generation and (2) the removal of the uncertainties around Macondo. While management has undoubtedly made progress on these fronts over the past year, this progress is more gradual than we had anticipated and we still feel there is limited visibility post 2014. Following the outperformance of the stock and more limited valuation support, we now see a more balanced risk/reward proposition in BP. Finally, Royal Mail celebrated its third month as a public company with more accusations from Labour it was sold on the cheap. It also unveiled price rises of up to 1% for its biggest customers but said they could see savings if they improved their forecasts of how much mail they would send. Royal Mail closed at 583p, up 22p, despite a sell note from Cantor Fitzgerald earlier in the week. The shares now stand at a 77% premium to the 330p flotation price.",

The move by the French-owned company is just one of a host of initiatives launched in 2014 by major power suppliers in a bid to rid themselves of an untrustworthy image in the eyes of consumers. Martin Stead, the marketing director at EDF Energy, told the trade publication Marketing that the energy supplier does not like the continued association with its rivals. \"How about we have a big five and we are actually the champion trying to do the right thing for customers to bear down on the bad things the industry is doing,\" he told them. Stead claims that EDF has a right to be treated and seen differently after winning new customers by launching a series of initiatives such as ending termination fees, keeping prices down relatively low and pushing for greater openness through the creation of a single unit price for energy - like the one at petrol stations. But the idea that EDF Energy should not be one of the big six and be seen instead as a consumer champion was described as \"frankly laughable\" by the Fuel Poverty Action group. \"Perhaps EDF executives are not aware that the company made nearly a billion pounds in profits in six months last year, but still put its prices up at the end of the year, or perhaps they have never read the messages posted on their social media pages, full of customers fed up with waiting for refunds or distressed at being put on a meter,\" said Clare Welton, a group spokeswoman. \"Presumably in the face of widespread criticism and dislike of the big six, EDF want to clean up their image. The only way they could do this would be to truly put people and planet's needs before their profits, and it is incredibly unlikely they, or any of the big six, will ever do that.,\" Dale Vince, founder of the small independent supplier Ecotricity, was also dismissive. \"The public are not stupid and will judge the big six by actions not words. Just abandoning the label will not change anything. Wasn't it EDF which was accused of blackmail before Christmas by threatening to put up prices if government did not reduce green levies?\" Meanwhile another of the major suppliers, npower, has started a major marketing campaign with newspaper adverts to run over the next three months emphasising how it is making things better for customers. A spokeswoman for the company, which is owned by RWE of Germany, said it was putting customers at the centre of the conversation but accepted the trust issue had to be tackled with actions, not just words. She said that money saved from ending the sponsorship deal with the Football League at the end of last season has been pumped into more practical actions such asredesigning bills. British Gas has also been rolling out a series of new initiatives including a scheme for free power on Saturdays.",

Monthly economic figures produced by Chinese state agencies are also hotly contested by analysts, many of whom believe that over-production of goods with increasing amounts of debt are a bigger problem for the economy than officials will admit. These disputes aside, there is a consensus that exports will continue to grow over the next year and the trade surplus built up over the last two decades will inflate further. The world wants Chinese goods. Chinese people also increasingly want Chinese goods. It's still the case that middle-income Chinese families are deeply suspicious of stuff made at home, which is why many buy their cosmetics and medicines from Korea and prefer western brands when safety is an issue. But during the country's biggest online shopping day of the year on 11 November \u2013 also the biggest in the world \u2013 the Wall Street Journal reported that the online trading site Alibaba.com recorded 35.2bn yuan (\u00a33.5bn) in transactions. The sale illustrated the rising power of Chinese brands, with the smartphone maker Xiaomi and the electronics and appliances supplier Haier Electronics among the top sellers. While most Chinese products are made from imported raw materials and demand at home and abroad is accelerating, Beijing is unlikely to surrender its crown as number one trading nation. Apart from the US, the only loser is likely to be the Brazilian environment, which is being destroyed for soya production, albeit at a slower rate than in the early part of the century. A Brazilian moratorium in 2005 ruled that soya grown on deforested land would not be exported. The moratorium covers 90% of Brazil's soybean exports, much of which is sold to China's pig farming industry. It runs out this month.",

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that in both manufacturing and the wider industrial sector output remained unchanged from the previous month, the weakest performance since August.

That was the biggest drop since June 2012 and came as both new work and repairs fell sharply. Economists said the disappointing reports tempered expectations that overall economic growth would hold steady at 0.8% or accelerate in the final quarter of last year. \"The hard data is not keeping pace with the red-hot business surveys, which could pose downside risks to fourth-quarter growth,\" said Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg bank.

The official figures contrast with surveys that have suggested growing activity and confidence among manufacturers. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiles the closely followed PMI surveys, described the ONS numbers as disappointing. He said: \"The PMI has been signalling some of the strongest rates of growth of output and new orders since the late 1990s in recent months, and the British Chambers of Commerce survey is likewise signalling record growth in the fourth quarter. \"Weaker-than-expected output of the industrial sector and a surprise drop in construction industry output in November suggests fourth-quarter economic growth could come in lower than the surveys are indicating.

It is a timely reminder that the recovery is not yet secure, and should also dampen the clamour for an early rise in interest rates. The government must continue to implement measures to boost growth, to ensure that the UK economy is on firmer ground before any such step is introduced.\"",

China's annual trade in goods passed the $4tn (\u00a32.4tn) mark for the first time last year according to official data, after exports from the world's second largest economy rose 7.9% to $2.21tn and imports rose 7.3% to $1.95tn. As a result total trade rose 7.6% over the year to $4.16tn. The US is yet to publish its 2013 trade figures, but with trade totalling $3.5tn in the first 11 months of the year, it is unlikely to beat China. The shift in the trading pecking order reflected China's rising global dominance, despite a slowdown in economic growth last year. Zheng Yuesheng, a spokesman for China's customs administration, said: \"It is very likely that China overtook the US to become the world's largest trading country in goods in 2013 for the first time. This is a landmark milestone for our nation's foreign trade development.\" China had already become the world's largest exporter of goods in 2009. The country's trade surplus rose 12.8% in 2013 to almost $260bn, but the December surplus of $25.6bn was down 17.4% and fell short of the $31.15bn predicted by economists in a Reuters poll. Stan Shamu, market strategist at IG, described the December figure as \"a high-quality miss once dissected\". \"Imports were up 8.3%, easily surpassing expectations of 5% and showing the second highest nominal reading ever recorded. While exports missed estimates at +4.3% (as opposed to the expected +5%), the value of exports was the highest ever recorded.\" There have been concerns in recent months over the accuracy of the country's trade data, with speculation that some Chinese companies have overstated their exports to circumvent controls on cross-border transactions and bring more cash into the country. However analysts said a recent clampdown on such activity was likely to result in more accurate data. In May last year China's foreign exchange regulator, the state administration of foreign exchange, announced plans to more closely scrutinise exports paperwork and impose tougher penalties where deals had been faked. Sun Junwei, China economist at HSBC in Beijing, said: \"Recent measures could be working to squeeze out these fake trade activities.

    "webTitle": "G4S and Serco failing to house asylum seekers properly, says watchdog", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Outsourcing companies G4S and Serco are failing to provide adequate housing for vulnerable asylum seekers or acquire habitable properties for them to live in, according to the government's spending watchdog. The government is seeking to recover rebates worth \u00a33m and \u00a34m respectively from the companies because of their poor performance, the National Audit Office has disclosed. It follows the introduction by the home secretary, Theresa May, of an outsourced \u00a3620m system called Compass to house 23,000 asylum seekers across Britain. Auditors are concerned that the system has also led to some claimants who earn above the legal threshold being given homes while other more needy families are losing out. The findings, published in a report released on Friday, have been welcomed by charities which have become increasingly concerned by the way that the companies are managing the system. The Refugee Council chief executive, Maurice Wren, said: \"Asylum seekers are often people who have fled horrifying experiences in their own countries and have lost everything. \"They do not get a choice where they live and are totally reliant on the Compass contractors to ensure that their properties are safe for them and their families to live in. \"Failure to provide adequate accommodation is always unacceptable. It's essential the Home Office sets clear standards, provides the resources required to deliver them and is tough on contractors who fail to meet them.\" Auditors raised concerns after an inquiry into government contracts with private companies G4S, Serco and Clearel for providing accommodation for asylum seekers. The Home Office provides accommodation and support for asylum seekers in the UK who are assessed as being \"destitute\". As of April last year, the Home Office provided accommodation for around 23,000 asylum seekers with around 60% receiving financial support from the department. At the end of 2012, the former UK Border Agency (UKBA) replaced 22 separate contracts provided by 13 different suppliers with six contracts, which were divided between G4S, Serco and Clearel. The move was known as the Commercial and Operational Managers Procuring Asylum Support Services (Compass) project and was supposed to save public money. G4S and Serco struggled throughout preparations for and during the transition, auditors found, causing continued uncertainty for asylum seekers. Both firms took on housing stock without inspecting it and subsequently found that many of these properties did not meet the contractual quality standards, auditors said. The outsourcers failed to meet contractual standards in some areas, the report said, such as finding properties for asylum seekers in a set timescale and on property conditions. The report also disclosed that G4S, Serco and Clearel were pushing for the government to allow them to expand into new areas outside the agreed postcodes for taking on asylum seekers. In its report, the spending watchdog said officials had visited homes where it was obvious that the asylum seeker's level of income was more than the threshold set to entitle an asylum seeker to housing. \"There is a risk that individuals or families may be occupying properties to which they are not entitled, thus taking resources away from those more in need,\" the NAO found. The Home office told auditors that it has launched national and regional discussions to look at current agreements. A G4S spokesperson said: \"We are pleased the report recognises that services are improving and that savings have been generated for the taxpayer under the new contracts. \"We agree with all recommendations made and many of these have already been implemented as part of our on-going commitment to service improvement.\" James Thorburn, managing director of Serco's Home Affairs business, said: \"We accept that there remains scope for further improvement and we are committed to working with the Home Office and our partners in local government, the NHS and the voluntary sector to achieve that.\"",

      "body": "<p>Outsourcing companies G4S and Serco are failing to provide adequate housing for vulnerable asylum seekers or acquire habitable properties for them to live in, according to the government's spending watchdog.</p> <p>The government is seeking to recover rebates worth \u00a33m and \u00a34m respectively from the companies because of their poor performance, the National Audit Office has disclosed.</p> <p>It follows the introduction by the home secretary, Theresa May, of an outsourced \u00a3620m system called Compass to house 23,000 asylum seekers across Britain.</p> <p>Auditors are concerned that the system has also led to some claimants who earn above the legal threshold being given homes while other more needy families are losing out.</p> <p>The findings, published in a report released on Friday, have been welcomed by charities which have become increasingly concerned by the way that the companies are managing the system.</p> <p>The Refugee Council chief executive, Maurice Wren, said: \"Asylum seekers are often people who have fled horrifying experiences in their own countries and have lost everything.</p> <p>\"They do not get a choice where they live and are totally reliant on the Compass contractors to ensure that their properties are safe for them and their families to live in.</p> <p>\"Failure to provide adequate accommodation is always unacceptable. It's essential the Home Office sets clear standards, provides the resources required to deliver them and is tough on contractors who fail to meet them.\"</p> <p>Auditors raised concerns after an inquiry into government contracts with private companies G4S, Serco and Clearel for providing accommodation for asylum seekers.</p> <p>The Home Office provides accommodation and support for asylum seekers in the UK who are assessed as being \"destitute\". As of April last year, the Home Office provided accommodation for around 23,000 asylum seekers with around 60% receiving financial support from the department.</p> <p>At the end of 2012, the former UK Border Agency (UKBA) replaced 22 separate contracts provided by 13 different suppliers with six contracts, which were divided between G4S, Serco and Clearel. The move was known as the Commercial and Operational Managers Procuring Asylum Support Services (Compass) project and was supposed to save public money.</p> <p>G4S and Serco struggled throughout preparations for and during the transition, auditors found, causing continued uncertainty for asylum seekers.</p> <p>Both firms took on housing stock without inspecting it and subsequently found that many of these properties did not meet the contractual quality standards, auditors said. The outsourcers failed to meet contractual standards in some areas, the report said, such as finding properties for asylum seekers in a set timescale and on property conditions.</p> <p>The report also disclosed that G4S, Serco and Clearel were pushing for the government to allow them to expand into new areas outside the agreed postcodes for taking on asylum seekers.</p> <p>In its report, the spending watchdog said officials had visited homes where it was obvious that the asylum seeker's level of income was more than the threshold set to entitle an asylum seeker to housing.</p> <p>\"There is a risk that individuals or families may be occupying properties to which they are not entitled, thus taking resources away from those more in need,\" the NAO found.</p> <p>The Home office told auditors that it has launched national and regional discussions to look at current agreements.</p> <p>A G4S spokesperson said: \"We are pleased the report recognises that services are improving and that savings have been generated for the taxpayer under the new contracts.</p> <p>\"We agree with all recommendations made and many of these have already been implemented as part of our on-going commitment to service improvement.\"</p> <p>James Thorburn, managing director of Serco's Home Affairs business, said: \"We accept that there remains scope for further improvement and we are committed to working with the Home Office and our partners in local government, the NHS and the voluntary sector to achieve that.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "John Lewis has hailed \"a cracking start to the year\" as consumers splashed out in the post-Christmas sales. Total sales across John Lewis department stores were up 23.6% on last year in the week ending 4 January, to \u00a3113.4m, it reported on Friday. The retailer's total sales, including online, were up 15.8%, while Waitrose also performed strongly with a 9.3% increase in sales over the week. The buoyant figures come after John Lewis enjoyed a record-breaking Christmas, boosted by strong sales of kettles, coffee machines and iPads. These appliances continued to sell well after Christmas, the company said, with consumers snapping up discounted white goods, as well as smaller kitchen goods and tablet computers at full-price. At Waitrose, New Year resolutions appeared to be kicking into full swing, as customers filled their baskets with vegetables, porridge oats and green tea. Sales of kale, the so-called super vegetable, currently flavour of the month with health-conscious celebrities, were up 58% on last year, while spinach sales rose 13%, garlic 15% and savoy cabbage 17%. Sushi sales were reported to be up 343%. John Lewis also said fashion, including its own branded clothes, had performed well, with sales up 28% on last year. Strong performance in its January sales confirms Christmas winner, alongside rival House of Fraser, in contrast to the lacklustre showing at Debenhams and falling clothing sales at Marks &amp; Spencer. \"After getting off to a cracking start immediately after Christmas our clearance [sale] performance continued to be strong last week, resulting in an outstanding 23.6% on last year,\" said Barry Matheson, director of retail services at John Lewis. \"This was despite horrendous weather conditions throughout the whole of the New Year period which did nothing to deter customers shopping with clicks or in bricks.\" Waitrose reported this week its best ever Christmas, making a record \u00a351m on 23 December, with 22,000 items going through its checkouts every minute. IHS economist Howard Archer said John Lewis's figures were extremely impressive. \"The performance highlighted John Lewis's position as one of the very top performers in the retailing sector. The John Lewis figures also highlighted the importance of having a strong online service as their online sales jumped 34.4% year-on-year in the week's trading. \"It also indicated that squeezed consumers have been extremely keen to take advantage of genuine bargains in the clearance sales.\" JD Sports also reported Christmas sales up more than 6% on last year, citing \"robust performance\" from its shops. Chairman Peter Cowgill told BBC Radio 5 Live that JD Sports had not needed to cut their prices in the runup to Christmas, like other retailers. \"The stores were so rammed, we struggled to keep up with demand so there was no need to discount,\" he said. Analysts at the company's house broker Investec said the figures implied the retailer had seen a pickup in momentum at its main JD Sports chain over the festive period. \"JD is in the fortunate position that it has a high proportion of exclusive product which isolates the business to an extent from all the promotional activity,\" said Investec. However, JD's statement hinted that trading was still tough at its portfolio of fashion chains, which include Bank and Scotts, while there was no comment on the group's struggling outdoorwear businesses \u2013 Millets and Blacks \u2013 both of which face growing competition from rival Sports Direct and its Republic chain.",

      "bodyText": "A last-minute rush to buy gifts and record online sales saved retailers' Christmas with a modest boost to December sales. Retail sales values during the month were 1.8% higher than the same month a year earlier, although that was slower growth than November's 2.3% rise, according to the British Retail Consortium/KPMG monthly report. Shoppers hunted out the best deals on toys and electricals, while coats and Christmas jumpers boosted clothing sales. As the windiest December since 1969 lashed Britain's high streets, online sales accounted for almost one in five purchases. Helen Dickinson, the BRC's director general, said the latest figures reflected \"a year of encouraging but fragile recovery\", with rising consumer confidence failing to be fully reflected in spending habits as budgets remained under pressure. \"The last-minute rush arrived as expected, giving a major boost to sales in the final few days before Christmas after a fairly flat showing mid-month,\" she said. Those retailers offering customers flexibility in how they shopped stood to benefit: consumers liked having the option of ordering online from a smartphone or tablet, to be delivered at home or collected in store. \"Multichannel is the other big story of the season,\" said Dickinson. \"This Christmas we've seen innovative retailers using click and collect and other approaches to make a virtue of both their website and their physical shops. And that's something we see growing in importance.\" The trend has been reflected in the Christmas trading figures published by some of the UK's biggest retailers. Winners have included John Lewis, Next and House of Fraser, which all did well online. Internet sales excluding food were up 19.2% in December compared with 2012 figures, accounting for 18.6% of all non-food sales in December, a year-on-year increase from 16.5%. \"Retailers now need to focus on the 'last mile' and figure out how to get the item to the customer even faster,\" said David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG. \"Retailers who can offer same day delivery, at a reasonable price, will be the winners in the race for sales in 2014, and steal a march on their competitors.\" On a like-for-like basis, stripping out the impact of stores open for less than a year, retail sales rose by 0.4% in December. Health and beauty was the top performer, as people bought fragrances and other premium products as gifts. Tablets and smartphones were also popular. \"With budgets still under pressure, many shoppers economised where they could to afford a little luxury here and there, and practical gifts such as bedroom furniture, children's clothing and kitchen appliances also proved popular,\" Dickinson said. The food sector was the most competitive, with slowing inflation, discounting and price wars testing customer loyalty. McCorquodale said paying for Christmas would be consumers' first priority of 2014, as inflation continues to outpace inflation. Over the final three months of 2013, total retail sales rose 2.2%, with non-food up 2.6% and food sales up 1.6%. Shoppers bought lots of prosecco and mulled wine in December, while affordable but \"alternative\" desserts such as panettone were popular.",

      "body": "<p>A last-minute rush to buy gifts and record online sales saved retailers' Christmas with a modest boost to December sales.</p> <p>Retail sales values during the month were 1.8% higher than the same month a year earlier, although that was slower growth than November's 2.3% rise, according to the British Retail Consortium/KPMG monthly report.</p> <p>Shoppers hunted out the best deals on toys and electricals, while coats and Christmas jumpers boosted clothing sales.</p> <p>As the windiest December since 1969 lashed Britain's high streets, online sales accounted for almost one in five purchases.</p> <p>Helen Dickinson, the BRC's director general, said the latest figures reflected \"a year of encouraging but fragile recovery\", with rising consumer confidence failing to be fully reflected in spending habits as budgets remained under pressure.</p> <p>\"The last-minute rush arrived as expected, giving a major boost to sales in the final few days before Christmas after a fairly flat showing mid-month,\" she said. Those retailers offering customers flexibility in how they shopped stood to benefit: consumers liked having the option of ordering online from a smartphone or tablet, to be delivered at home or collected in store.</p> <p>\"Multichannel is the other big story of the season,\" said Dickinson. \"This Christmas we've seen innovative retailers using click and collect and other approaches to make a virtue of both their website and their physical shops. And that's something we see growing in importance.\"</p> <p>The trend has been reflected in the Christmas trading figures published by some of the UK's biggest retailers. Winners have included John Lewis, Next and House of Fraser, which all did well online.</p> <p>Internet sales excluding food were up 19.2% in December compared with 2012 figures, accounting for 18.6% of all non-food sales in December, a year-on-year increase from 16.5%.</p> <p>\"Retailers now need to focus on the 'last mile' and figure out how to get the item to the customer even faster,\" said David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG. \"Retailers who can offer same day delivery, at a reasonable price, will be the winners in the race for sales in 2014, and steal a march on their competitors.\"</p> <p>On a like-for-like basis, stripping out the impact of stores open for less than a year, retail sales rose by 0.4% in December.</p> <p>Health and beauty was the top performer, as people bought fragrances and other premium products as gifts. Tablets and smartphones were also popular.</p> <p>\"With budgets still under pressure, many shoppers economised where they could to afford a little luxury here and there, and practical gifts such as bedroom furniture, children's clothing and kitchen appliances also proved popular,\" Dickinson said.</p> <p>The food sector was the most competitive, with slowing inflation, discounting and price wars testing customer loyalty.</p> <p>McCorquodale said paying for Christmas would be consumers' first priority of 2014, as inflation continues to outpace inflation.</p> <p>Over the final three months of 2013, total retail sales rose 2.2%, with non-food up 2.6% and food sales up 1.6%.</p> <p>Shoppers bought lots of prosecco and mulled wine in December, while affordable but \"alternative\" desserts such as panettone were popular.</p>",

This week submissions to the inquiry by Infrastructure Australia (IA) and Industry Super Australia have spurred the privatisation debate. But a report earlier in the week demonstrated support for selling government assets is decidedly mixed. On Monday the Australian Financial Review reported an interview with the head of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Rod Sims, which implied he recommended the government sell Australia Post. Not surprisingly, this suggestion saw the National party respond in about the time it would take you to lick a stamp. Senator John Williams responded by not only arguing the many rural services Australia Post provide are a natural monopoly, he also rather killed any chance of the government being able to ask for a decent price for the organisation by saying of it, \u201cWho wants to buy a dead dog?\u201d Sims also refuted the AFR\u2019s version of the interview.

So while IA\u2019s submission does talk of higher efficiency of privately owned companies over public enterprises, the benefits of privatisation are now more focused on its ability to improve governments\u2019 budget balances. The sales of assets are pitched as a way to reduce debt and perhaps use the proceeds to build other needed infrastructure. Often however, this promise for more infrastructure spending is more in the promise than the reality. Economist John Quiggin has noted that such increased infrastructure spending did not occur in Queensland under the Bligh government despite nearly $10bn in sales of government-owned assets. The argument of an improved budget position relies on the view that the proceeds from the sale exceed the net present value of proceeds that would have produced through annual dividends to the government. Because if this were not the case, the government would merely be forgoing future revenue to get money now, but in the long run be no better off. IA considered various state infrastructure assets such as ports, electricity generators, transmission and distribution assets and water assets such as SA Water and Sydney Water. It concluded the sales of all 30 assets would bring in $92bn but would see the various governments would forgo future dividends worth about $28bn in today\u2019s money. This suggests there is a $64bn gain to governments through selling all 30 assets. That sounds wonderful, but before governments start counting the money, they should note IA\u2019s submission also examined the suitability of such assets for sale \u2013 categorising them in four levels of suitability. Water infrastructure assets accounted for $25.5bn of the $64bn, however IA noted such assets were all in the lowest and second-lowest categories. Of \u201curban water and wastewater assets in regional towns\u201d IA noted they were \u201cgenerally not commercial and would not yield significant privatisation proceeds\u201d. Of the \u201cmetropolitan water and wastewater and rural water assets\u201d only Sydney and Melbourne were deemed to operate within a regulatory environment that might yield significant returns from a sale. IA did recommend the electricity and airport and ports assets \u201cbe privatised either immediately or with only minor regulatory reforms\u201d. But the political difficulty remains because, as IA noted, \u201cmany economic infrastructure assets have monopoly characteristics which could potentially enable their owners to misuse their market power and earn monopoly profits\u201d. To counter this, an effective regulatory environment is required, but such regulation almost immediately comes under pressure to be weakened by the same people who were advocating the initial privatisation \u2013 including the buyers. Many voters also dislike losing \u201cownership\u201d of these assets \u2013 especially if the buyer is foreign and the profits are viewed to \u201cdisappear\u201d overseas. Here the submission by Industry Super Australia may provide an outlet for those wishing to win over doubters. Its submission, reported in the Australian, notes the public are often concerned that privatisation is more about job cuts, higher prices and quick profits than ongoing provision of services. Its submission cites a poll that found community support for privatisation rose from 13% to 75% if the new owner was a superannuation fund. Given the Abbott government\u2019s previous criticism of industry super funds as \u201cgravy trains for union officials\u201d in a delicious irony, it may now see such funds as the lifeline for its privatisation dreams.",
