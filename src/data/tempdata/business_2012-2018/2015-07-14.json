      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve now got hold of the new IMF report into Greece\u2019s debt sustainability. And a quick perusal shows that the Fund has comprehensively obliterated the notion that this third Greek bailout will work, as it stands. The introduction to the report says enough, really: Greece\u2019s public debt has become highly unsustainable. This is due to the easing of policies during the last year, with the recent deterioration in the domestic macroeconomic and financial environment because of the closure of the banking system adding significantly to the adverse dynamics. The financing need through end-2018 is now estimated at \u20ac85bn and debt is expected to peak at close to 200 percent of GDP in the next two years, provided that there is an early agreement on a program. Greece\u2019s debt can now only be made sustainable through debt relief measures that go far beyond what Europe has been willing to consider so far. The IMF\u2019s fundamental conclusion is that Greece will simply not be able to borrow at affordable rates again, until its debt burden is lower. The situation was already bad - but recent developments make it much, much worse. The events of the past two weeks\u2014the closure of banks and imposition of capital controls\u2014are extracting a heavy toll on the banking system and the economy, leading to a further significant deterioration in debt sustainability relative to what was projected in our recently published DSA. Today\u2019s report is light on projections, but the ones included are stark enough. The stand-out fact: Greek debt is on track to peak at close to 200% of GDP in the next two years. Only Japan, after two lost decades, comes close to that ratio. Perhaps this is why the US government, led by Treasury secretary Jack Lew, has been so vocal about the need for debt sustainability to be addressed? The IMF is also amusingly sniffy about the targets Greece is being set. For example: Medium-term primary surplus target: Greece is expected to maintain primary surpluses for the next several decades of 3.5 percent of GDP. Few countries have managed to do so. The reversal of key public sector reforms already in place\u2014 notably pension and civil service reforms\u2014without yet any specification of alternative reforms raises concerns about Greece\u2019s ability to reach this target But it\u2019s conclusion is clear - if Europe wants this bailout to work, it must either grant Greece three decades grace before repaying its debts, or cut the face value of its borrowings, deeply.... And on that note, we\u2019re going to shut down for the night. Back tomorrow. Goodnight! GW THIS IS IT. The IMF stating as bluntly as it can that Europe must decide between giving Greece a 30-year grace period to repay its debt, and accepting the reality that serious haircuts must be taken: Some late breaking news: The International Monetary Fund has confirmed today\u2019s leaked report which warned that Greece needs much more debt relief than the eurozone has accepted: Here\u2019s the details; Heads-up: the process of driving Greece\u2019s bailout deal through parliament will start early: Even if you think Alexis Tsipras has misplayed the crisis, it\u2019s hard not to be impressed by his composure in tonight\u2019s interview. Barely 36 hours after agreeing the punitive bailout deal with fellow eurozone leaders, the Greek PM has given a solid defense of the agreement he brought back from Brussels. He was scathing about the tactics played by his opponents, declaring: \u201cLast night was a bad night for Europe.\u201d and adding that the events last weekend \u201cdoes not honour the tradition of a democratic Europe\u201d. He repeated his claim that, by calling a referendum, he had ended up with a better deal that addresses Greece\u2019s medium-term funding needs. And, eventually, debt relief. He said: \u201cTo be frank, here, they [eurozone countries] are not only forced to give fresh money, but to give 82 billion, and are accepting the restructure of debt.\u201d However, there was no pretense that he\u2019d played a blinder in Brussels. Tsipras even admitted that he didn\u2019t believe in the plan forced on Greece - but he\u2019d do his best to implement it. \u201cI am fully assuming my responsibilities, for mistakes and for oversights, and for the responsibility of signing a text that I do not believe in, but that I am obliged to implement,\u201d There were signs that Tsipras was still digesting the impact of his all-night battles with his eurozone neighbours, as he said bitterly that: \u201cThe hard truth is this one-way street for Greece was imposed on us,\u201d On Grexit, he warned that the risk hadn\u2019t totally vanished, until the bailout deal has been ratified. But he was adamant that the country didn\u2019t have the resources to cope outside the eurozone. And he claimed that some conservative groups would be keen to see Syriza out on their collective ear. The bruises from the Euro summit may never really heal. He didn\u2019t dump the blame for the crisis on Yanis Varoufakis -- his former finance minister was a great economist; that doesn\u2019t always translate into political skills, though. But perhaps most importantly, Tsipras vowed to fight on and take hard decisions. \u201cThe worst thing a captain could do while he is steering a ship during a storm, as difficult as it is, would be to abandon the helm.\u201d We\u2019ll find out on Wednesday night whether Cap\u2019n Alexis has the support of the crew, when Syriza are asked to vote on the tough austerity and radical economic reforms demanded by creditors. But tonight, he\u2019s got his hand on the rudder. What about the big question ahead of tomorrow night\u2019s vote on the bailout -- might you resign? Tsipras says that \u201cA captain cannot abandon ship\u201d during a storm. And on the possibility of a unity government, the PM says it is important not to \u201ccreate instability\u201d during these critical times. So, is the threat of Grexit finally off the table? Tsipras says that, until the bailout deal is finalised, nothing is certain. We won\u2019t reverse the measures we have taken this year, the PM insists (so the cleaning ladies re-instated after a long campaign may be safe) Comedy moment as a phone rings somewhere offstage..... The hugely controversial \u20ac50bn privatisation fund could have been worse, Tsipras says. Initially it was all going to pay down debt (Merkel\u2019s demand); now half is going to recapitalise the banks. Tsipras concedes that Yanis Varoufakis made mistakes, but takes responsibility for them himself. Great economists don\u2019t always make good politicians.... Tsipras reveals that he challenged the German chancellor earlier this year, once former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis warned that Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble wanted Greece to leave. On the issue of Grexit, Tsipras says Greece simply isn\u2019t in a position to handle a return to the drachma. Not only would the banks collapse, but it would cause \u2018huge problems\u2019 elsewhere. Interesting....Tsipras says he won\u2019t claim the deal is a success, but it is the only one on offer: Asked about suggestions Sunday\u2019s deal was an attempted coup, Tsipras says there are some elements - in Greece and abroad - who would like his government to fall. He singles out the European People\u2019s Party - the home of Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party, Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, Council president Donald Tusk, and Greece\u2019s New Democracy party (and many other conservative groups) I don\u2019t believe in the agreement, but I\u2019ll sign it anyway rather than walking away..... The Big NO in Greece\u2019s referendum 9 days ago didn\u2019t actually spare us from austerity, Tsipras admits: More Tsipras. He says that Greece \u201cfought a battle\u201d to protect wages and pensions from cuts. And he suggests Greece can exit the crisis in three years. That\u2019s quite a change on his campaigning speeches in January. And it means Greece would have been in the mire for almost a decade. Tsipras is adamant that he\u2019s come back with a better deal. He argues that Greece needs pension reforms - and that although VAT hikes will be regressive, the impact is balanced by other measures. Tsipras is arguing that the yes/no referendum strengthened his hand, and meant Greece got a better than was on offer before - which covers all our medium-term financing needs. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s interview with ERT has begun, in his prime ministerial office. The PM says that Sunday was a bad night for Europe, in which severe pressure was placed on his country and its people. The traditions of Europe were not respected. We ended up with a tough agreement, but at least it\u2019s not the dead end we faced earlier. He\u2019s speaking calmly, seriously, and tie-lessly of course. While we wait to hear from Alexis Tsipras, here\u2019s some new polling data showing that a majority of Greeks wants parliament to approve the bailout agreement, and Tsipras to stay as PM. The Greek prime minister is due to begin giving an interview to state TV in around 10 minutes It will be streamed live here. Ahead of tomorrow\u2019s vote in the Greek parliament on the bailout agreement tortuously agreed over the weekend , the International Monetary Fund has said the country needs massively more debt relief than the eurozone has admitted. The IMF has updated its debt sustainability analysis to reflect the damage wrecked on the Greek economy since capital controls were imposed more than two weeks ago. The IMF said: \u201cThe dramatic deterioration in debt sustainability points to the need for debt relief on a scale that would need to go well beyond what has been under consideration to date - and what has been proposed by the ESM.\u201d This has led some to speculate the IMF wants to wash its hands of Greece altogether. Here is our report on the IMF\u2019s conclusions: Meanwhile Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras is due to appear on Greek television later (again). The finance ministry has submitted the necessary legislation ahead of the parlimentary vote tomorrow. Tsipras may well win the vote but with members of his own party rebelling, his authority could be damaged enough that snap elections may be needed. In any case a reshuffle of his cabinet is likely. Antti-austerigy protests tomorrow will also put pressure on the government. The bailout deal also has to be passed by other eurozone parliaments, with Austria and Germany set to both vote on Friday. Elsewhere there were reports that the European Commission intended tapping the EFSM stability fund to help finance a bridging loan for Greece. President Obama has reportedly welcomed the Greek deal in telephone conversation with German chancellor Angela Merkel. The US of course has been concerned about the impact of financial chaos in the eurozone on its own economic growth prospects. Could there be trouble brewing even if the Greek parliament passes the legislation? Greek MPs will pass the bailout terms on Wednesday, according to advisory firm Teneo, but there is the risk Alexis Tsipras will be so weakened there will be a snap election. The legislation on the bailout has been submitted to parliament, as required by the EU deal: Here are two Syriza MPs who it appears will vote against the bailout terms tomorrow: In rather uncertain trading - hardly surprising given the circumstances - European markets have, in the main, ended the day in positive territory. But it was not a convincing move, as investors wait to see if the Greek deal agreed after marathon weekend meetings will actually stick. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 0.23% higher at 6753.75 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.21% to 11,508.46 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.61% at 5028.51 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.38% bette at 11,266.4 But Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.3% to 23,097.51 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.29%. More on the possible Greek government changes: Over in Athens the Greek government has just announced that embattled prime minister Alexis Tsipras will be giving an exclusive interview to ERT1 this evening at 10 PM local time. Helena Smith reports: Tsipras has taken increasingly to personally explaining his government\u2019s policies and by extension, the twists and turns of the Greek crisis, on state-run television. This will be at least the fourth time in recent weeks that the leader has addressed Greeks. Despite everything, he still enjoys record popularity ratings - and his beleaguered government is clearly now keen to exploit that fact. Many Greeks have rallied around claims made by several leading members of the government today that a coup is in motion, aimed squarely, at regime change in Athens. Here\u2019s our report on the IMF\u2019s call for a greater level of debt relief for Greece. Economics editor Larry Elliott writes: The severe damage caused to the Greek economy by more than two weeks of bank closures and capital controls means the stricken eurozone country will require far more generous debt relief than is currently on offer from its single-currency partners, according to the International Monetary Fund. A report by the Washington-based Fund leaked to the news agency Reuters shows that Greece\u2019s public debt is likely to peak at 200% of its national income within the next two years, with the risk that the actual outcome could be even worse. The debt sustainability analysis comes on the eve of a crucial vote in Athens when the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, will be seeking parliamentary approval for the fresh austerity measures demanded by the eurozone in return for a three-year rescue package worth up to \u20ac86bn (\u00a361bn). Putting into question its involvement in the bailout, the IMF report paints a far darker picture of Greece\u2019s public finances than contained in the blueprint released at the end of the marathon eurozone leaders\u2019 summit on Monday. \u201cThe dramatic deterioration in debt sustainability points to the need for debt relief on a scale that would need to go well beyond what has been under consideration to date \u2013 and what has been proposed by the ESM,\u201d the IMF said, referring to the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund which will be used to bankroll the Greek bailout plan. Throughout the Greek crisis, the IMF has consistently urged deeper debt relief but has met resistance from European finance ministers, who have been unwilling to make their taxpayers pay the cost of a write-down. The full piece is here: EC commissioner Pierre Moscovici has admitted the deal agreed yesterday will be tough on Greece but said it was a good one because it opens a way out of the recent impasse and keeps the country in the eurozone. Writing in a blog post he said: This timetable is tight, but it is a necessary antidote to the mistrust that has developed between Athens and its eurozone partners... The agreement also sets Athens on a path of extremely precise reforms, and includes safeguards to prevent the country from deviating from that path. But he added: Some say the terms of the agreement are unacceptable for Greece, even describing them as a gun to the head. Some believe that they are too demanding for a country whose population has suffered greatly for five years, and whose economy entered into recession again this year. I understand that position. And I also care first and foremost about the Greek people. The future programme will have to strike a balance between economic necessity and political reality. If excessive mistrust led us to ask the impossible of Greece would be damaging for all. I hope we give Greece a chance to prove its good faith, and that the future programme allows the country to raise its head economically and politically. Still, we lost six months. During which the situation in Greece has deeply deteriorated. The human, political and economic cost of the agreement increased dramatically. This makes me sad and leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. For it is the Greek people who, once again, will bear the costs. The full post is here. Austria\u2019s parliament is reportedly set to vote on the Greek deal on Friday, the same day as Germany. Peter Kazimir, the Slovak finance minister, ran into some controversy yesterday by tweeting that the compromise reached was tough for Athens because it was the result of their \u201cGreece Spring.\u201d That was subsequently deleted but Kazimir has waded in again just now, changing \u201cGreek Spring\u201d to \u201cSyriza Spring.\u201d The European Commission is downplaying the latest IMF report, writes Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. A Commission spokeswoman said she had not seen it. She added that the IMF and the Commission had together signed off on an economic assessment that put Greece\u2019s funding needs at \u20ac74-\u20ac78bn from 2015-18. This was the document sent to finance ministers on Saturday and formed the basis for the bailout agreement that emerged on Monday morning. She said: \u201cThis is the document that is relevant for a possible ESM programme,\u201d a bailout under the European Stability Mechanism fund. Tyrie: \u201cArguably it\u2019s the IMF that also needs some reinforcement. The IMF has got itself into a bit of a pickle, hasn\u2019t it? It\u2019s heavily exposed. Is it going to get its money back? Are you looking at that issue and the vulnerability of the IMF itself?\u201d Carney: \u201cI think it is important to recognise the preferred creditor status of the IMF and that any contemplated extension adjustment to the debt of Greece should respect that. I agree, as a personal view, that it\u2019s important that the IMF in any situation is an independent institution providing objective advice and making appropriate lending decisions in that context.\u201d Tyrie: \u201cAre you confident it has been doing that?\u201d Carney: \u201cWhat I would say that... even with the benefit of hindsight, given the stakes in 2010 and the contagion that was possible in 2010 because of the very grave imperfections in Europe there was merit in not having a ... disorderly restructuring at that time. \u201cNow a much clearer eyed assessment of the scale of the restructuring that was necessary was apparent to some at the time and would have been welcome. It clearly would have been welcome in hindsight. What\u2019s important now is that\u2019s water under the bridge and what\u2019s important now is that the IMF is as objective, and as transparent and as public as possible with its assessment of the debt sustainability of Greece. And I would say with the release of the debt sustainability analysis last week and perhaps subsequent comments that appears to be what they are trying to do.\u201d Tyrie: \u201cHas the Bank been giving thought as to whether the IMF should have got itself so close to this whole issue rather than giving independent advice to its quota members?\u201d Carney: \u201cThe UK representative at the IMF is appointed by the Treasury not the Bank. We worked with - in recent days, weeks, months - with the IMF to offer independent perspective on some of these issues, potential solutions to these issues in an effort to be helpful. The Fund is dealing with an extremely fluid situation obviously in Greece and I\u2019ll just reiterate that there is no simple solution as you can appreciate... There will need to be debt relief in our view... but debt relief in and of itself will not be sufficient to the other elements of structural reform and fiscal adjustment that are going to be required as will a measure of privatisation be required ultimately. \u201cAnd I will finish with this... I think it does underscore again that the institutions of European monetary union are unfinished and need to be reinforced. This process, the scale of the issue, the response and some of the things that were contemplated on the weekend for Greece by the eurogroup, underscore the need for considerable reinforcement and extension of those institutions for those countries that are part of the euro area.\u201d Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been continuing his evidence to parliament\u2019s Treasury select committee, where the committee\u2019s chair Andre Tyrie has just asked him about that IMF paper on the need for much bigger debt relief for Greece. Here is the exchange, which alludes to Carney\u2019s comments earlier this morning to the committee that working through the euro summit agreement requires \u201cHerculean efforts from all sides\u201d. Tyrie: \u201cYou described this as a Herculean task, Governor. Hasn\u2019t the IMF already confirmed your view that Hercules might not be up to it?\u201d Carney: \u201cAs you say, I haven\u2019t seen what the Fund had said. I would say as follows, in the statement, of the euro group leaders there was an observation about ... subject to progress of Greece on various actions... they would look to the possibilitiy of smoothing the debt profile in order to provide additional relief... no haircuts but changing the profile. \u201cThat is the extent to which debt relief has been contemplated as far as I am aware at the eurogroup. The point I was making, which sounds to be consistent with what the IMF was saying... is this is a considerable need and it\u2019s one that should be assessed as objectively as possible.\u201d Angela Merkel and her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, have come under sharp attack at home for their handling of the Greek crisis talks, with some opposition politicians accusing them of blackmailing Athens. Ahead of a special session of the Bundestag on Friday at which Merkel, the German chancellor, will ask parliamentarians to support negotiations for a third bailout for Greece, some MPs accused her and Sch\u00e4uble of deliberately trying to split Europe. Gerhard Schick, the financial expert of the Green party, accused the finance minister of acting \u201cextremely dangerously\u201d concerning his proposals for a temporary exit of Greece from the eurozone. \u201cWith his Grexit plan Sch\u00e4uble was calling for the division of Europe,\u201d he said. He called Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s plan \u201ca completely new negotiating position\u201d, which had been tabled without the approval of the rest of the German government. The deputy leader of the far-left Linke, Dietmar Bartsch, meanwhile accused the German government of extortion. \u201cThis negotiation result is a German diktat and nothing other than blackmail,\u201d he told German television. Sch\u00e4uble in particular had \u201csmashed an awful lot of porcelain\u201d during the talks, he added. With his Grexit paper he had \u201ctaken the axe to Europe. It is terrible what he did and the way he used it to threaten other countries,\u201d Bartsch said. Full story: Speaking of France... Marine Le Pen has kept up her barrage of criticism of the Greek deal, which she says will have \u201cheavy consequences\u201d on French taxpayers and the the country\u2019s debt. She accused the European Union of \u201ctotalitarian\u201d behaviour, in a statement released by the Front National, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s clear he [Hollande] wasn\u2019t guided by national interest, making this terrible declaration on the day of this national holiday, that the interests of the French people come after \u201cEuropean interests\u201d.\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has used his traditional Bastille Day interview to insist that Greece was not \u201chumiliated\u201d by the EU bailout deal and that the most important thing for the Greeks and for Europe was that the country remained inside the eurozone. He argued that \u201cdriving\u201d Greece from the eurozone would have been considerably more humiliating. \u201cI could not accept the humiliation of a people\u2026humiliation would have been to drive them from the euro zone,\u201d Hollande said. And he insisted the France-German relationship, reportedly strained over the bailout negotiations, was a strong as ever. \u201cWithout the Franco-German couple it was not possible to find an agreement. When Germany and France are not united, Europe cannot go forward.\u201d Hollande said he had advised Alexis Tsipras not to hold a referendum, but added that he respected the Greek prime minister\u2019s decision to ignore that advice and described him as \u201ccourageous\u201d . \u201cI told him: help me to help you,\u201d Hollande said France and Germany would now draw up new rules for \u201cbetter economic governance\u201d in the EU and that France would come up with proposals, though he did not give details. \u201cIn the long run I would like there to be a parliament for the eurozone,\u201d he added calling for greater harmonisation of \u201cfiscal and social policies\u201d in the single currency zone. \u201cThis is what we, along with Germany, want,\u201d On the subject of European economic rules, the French president might want to look at putting his country\u2019s own house in order: since 2003, France has repeatedly failed to meet European deadlines to bring its public deficit under the 3% of GDP required by the EU. In 2013, exasperated European finance ministers gave France a two-year deadline to meet the target but have been persuaded to extend this for another two years. The French government does not currently envisage doing so before 2017, but has managed to convince Brussels to let it off being fined. The eurozone leaders knew of the IMF\u2019s debt analysis before agreeing the third bailout terms for Greece, an EU source has told Reuters. More from the IMF. Deputy managing director Zhu Min added to the fund\u2019s calls for debt relief for Greece. Bloomberg reports: Greece needs debt relief to aid the economy after agreeing to a range of austerity measures in exchange for a bailout, said Zhu Min, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund. \u201cThe financing is clearly a very important issue for the Greek economy and the debt relief is also an important issue,\u201d Zhu said in an interview on Tuesday in Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, where he is attending a development finance conference. \u201cGiven the debt ratio is way high, something we need to think of is a proper way to do the debt relief profile and debt restructuring to reduce the burdens and help the economy move forward.\u201d Story here. Look who\u2019s talking (again). Former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has blogged his views on the bailout deal which Alexis Tsipras reluctantly signed up for on Monday morning. And he\u2019s not impressed, declaring that: Never before has the European Union made a decision that undermines so fundamentally the project of European Integration. Europe\u2019s leaders, in treating Alexis Tsipras and our government the way they did, dealt a decisive blow against the European project. The project of European integration has, indeed, been fatally wounded over the past few days. And as Paul Krugman rightly says, whatever you think of Syriza, or Greece, it wasn\u2019t the Greeks or Syriza who killed off the dream of a democratic, united Europe.... Varoufakis is \u201creserving judgement\u201d on the legislation until he hears from Alexis Tsipras and Euclid Tsakalotos. They were left dealing the Greek mess after Yanis hot-tailed it out of the finance ministry on his motorbike. He also suggests the media are wrong to focus on whether MPs will pass the legislation into law. The crucial question is: Does the Greek economy stand any chance of recovery under these terms? Another question could be: Would the Greek economy be in a better state if Varoufakis had never rocked up at the finance ministry? #discuss Using the EFSM to fund the Greek bridging loan would cause the most almighty row in Europe, and not just with Britain. Sweden and Denmark also opposed using the EU-wide fund to finance Greece, apparently: Nothing has been decided yet, though; the official line from Valdis Dombrovskis at the lunchtime press conference was that work was continuing. Developments in Brussels...... Reuters is snapping that the Commission is going to ignore George Osborne\u2019s concerns, and recommend tapping the EFSM to fund Greece\u2019s bridge financing. That would mean breaking the agreement that the EFSM should not be used for eurozone rescues. The IMF\u2019s leaked report is potentially dynamite, because the Fund cannot lend to a country if it doesn\u2019t believe it would be sustainable. So unless Europe swallows the reality that Greece needs major debt relief, the IMF won\u2019t provide any more bailout funds. Officially, the IMF line that it \u201cstands ready to work with the Greek authorities,\u201d But we can now see that it is actually saying that another \u201cextend and pretend\u201d bailout deal is fundamentally flawed. This secret IMF report also warns that Greece\u2019s national debt could soon hit 200% of GDP, even further into unsustainable levels. Breaking away from Brussels.... a leaked International Monetary Fund report has shown that Greece needs massively more debt relief than the eurozone has admitted. The IMF has updated its debt sustainability analysis to reflect the damage wrecked on the Greek economy since capital controls were imposed more than two weeks ago. And it shows that even more Greek debt needs to be wiped away that Europe faced up to. The IMF says: \u201cThe dramatic deterioration in debt sustainability points to the need for debt relief on a scale that would need to go well beyond what has been under consideration to date - and what has been proposed by the ESM.\u201d Currently, eurozone countries have been talking about \u2018reprofiling\u2019 Greek debt, to push back repayment dates or cut the interest rate on loans. But this IMF report states that Greece would need a 30-year grace period. Alternatively, the eurozone could make explicit annual transfers of cash to Greece, or it could bite the bullet and take \u201cdeep upfront haircuts\u201d. Eurogroup officials are still looking at solutions to find bridge funding for Greece, says vice-president Dombrovskis. Different options are being explored, including using the EFSM. Dombrovskis confirms that: \u201cConcerns were raised by several non-euro states. We need to take that into account.\u201d (So George Osborne wasn\u2019t alone in raising concerns, given there was an agreement not to use EFSM funds for euro bailout) All the options are quite difficult, and have political, legal or financial complications, Dombrovskis adds. Recent developments in Greece shows the need to strengthen European monetary union, EC vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis tells the Ecofin press conference. And the muted market reaction to the crisis shows that progress has been made in creating crisis-fighting tools and avoiding contagion, he adds. Sch\u00e4uble has also outlined how Alexis Tsipras should blame himself for the way things worked out: I\u2019m not sure the UK would support using the EU budget to fund Greece either; it still puts money from non-eurozone members at stake (but what price European unity, George?) Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble appears to have agreed with George Osborne, that the EFSM fund should not be used to find a loan to Greece. European finance ministers have exited ECOFIN and are chatting to the press. Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble doesn\u2019t sound too optimistic of finding a bridge loan for Athens (to cover repayments to the ECB in July and August) Spain\u2019s Luis de Guindos is more upbeat. One solution to Greece\u2019s bridging loan problem would be for another country to make a bilateral loan. So who\u2019s going to embrace European unity and dip into their pockets? Greece\u2019s economy minister George Stathakis, has predicted that Alexis Tsipras will reshuffle his cabinet tomorrow night, after the bailout vote. Interviewed on Bloomberg, Stathakis added that he couldn\u2019t rule out changes today, though. Stathakis claimed that Greece\u2019s banks will reopen just after European parliaments have given their approval to the bailout plan (so not until Monday, at the earliest). And that assumes the ECB responds by raising its cap on emergency liquidity. Lifting capital controls will take \u201ca couple of months\u201d, though, given the complexity. Stathakis also denied that depositors will be \u2018bailed-in\u2019 to a bank rescue, pointing out that the bailout plan includes \u20ac25bn to recapitalise the sector. Heads-up.... the ECOFIN press conference is about to start. Could there be developments on the Greek bridging loan?....... Back in Athens, there\u2019s a rumour that the secretary of Syriza\u2019s central committee, Tassos Koronakis, isn\u2019t at all happy about the bailout deal. Traders are betting that Greece will remain in the euro until at least the start of next year, even though the deal isn\u2019t in the bag yet. Here\u2019s a handy breakdown of the Greek bailout plan: Mark Carney isn\u2019t alone in worrying that the Greek deal is hard to pull off. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, says there is \u201cample room for error\u201d, as Alexis Tsipras tries to drive through labour market reforms, pension cuts, VAT tax increases, privatizations, higher corporate taxes, a military spending cut and additional IMF involvement in Greece. In exchange, Greece is set to receive an \u20ac86bn euro bailout package that should in theory return the country and its banks to liquidity and solvency. Debt relief will apparently be put on the table for discussion once Greek is demonstrably compliant with the initial conditions. This development has sharply reduced the risk of a Greek Eurozone exit by a significant margin, but that risk has not vanished altogether (we put it at around 35%, down from 60% over the next year). But even if Greece clings on, there is \u201csignificant risk\u201d that the country stumbles at some later juncture and is unable to recover within the constraints of the Eurozone, Lascelles adds. Mark Carney\u2019s deputy, Jon Cunliffe, says the eurozone is under \u201ca lot of strain\u201d. He cites the German suggestion that Greece could get a \u201ctime out\u201d from the euro. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has just warned MPs that it will be very hard to implement the Greek bailout deal. Testifying to the Treasury Committee in Westminster, Carney warned that success will require \u201cHerculean efforts\u201d from all sides. The scale of structural reforms, fiscal adjustment, privatisations required will be significant. There are big execution risks....and Greece\u2019s debts are not sustainable in their current form, he warns. Carney adds that the events of recent months underline the eurozone\u2019s \u201cinstitutional shortcomings\u201d. That\u2019s not just his view - it\u2019s shared by Europe\u2019s \u201cFour Presidents\u201d (of the European Council, Commission, Parliament and ECB) My colleague Andrew Sparrow is live-blogging the whole session here: And you can watch the session live here. A nice summary of Athens\u2019 stance today: Here\u2019s George Osborne making his views known to Alex Stubb and Jeroen Dijsselbloem: Stubb and Dijsselbloem were in high spirits, as they were joined by Sweden\u2019s Magdalena Andersson. But how are they doing to get over the difficulties and legal impossibilities, and deliver bridge financing to Greece? The UK chancellor is now kicking off in Brussels, over the idea that the short-term loans Greece desperately needs could be partly funded with British cash. The right-wing Independent Greeks party, the government\u2019s junior partner, has just offered Tsipras some support over the hugely controversial deal he brought back from Brussels. Panos Kammenos, the party\u2019s leader, has just declared that: \u201cWe will stand by Alexis Tsipras government.\u201d Many of Kammenos\u2019s MPs have said the new agreement, as outlined in the marathon overnight meeting in Brussels, is much harsher than the original one the coalition had endorsed last weekend and, as such, is unacceptable. But Kammenos is still backing the PM, telling reporters that: \u201cIt is clear to all of Europe that yesterday night a coup happened in the heart of Europe. The PM was blackmailed into signing a very different agreement. And this coup is continuing here in Greece where people want the government to fall.\u201d Whatever the outcome, Kammenos, who is also defence minister and clearly enjoying power, has said he will continue backing the government \u2013 but only if it remains a two-party coalition which, increasingly, does not look the case. Over in Athens governing Syriza party sources are not ruling out a reshuffle taking place as early as today, following Tsipras\u2019s meeting with his party. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. Such is prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 determination to clear the political terrain, that speculation is mounting a cabinet reshuffle could take place today. The tough stance of energy minister and leading defector, Panagiotis Lafazanis, has helped focus minds, say insiders. One told me: \u201cThe preference would be for a reshuffle after the vote but nothing can now be ruled out.\u201d Among the scenarios being considered is the formation of a cross-party government of special purpose that would help lift the heavy weight of not only pushing reforms through parliament but implementing them too. The radical left party is increasingly fighting a battle for survival in government with cadres saying Syriza\u2019s overall aim is not to go down as a \u201cleft parenthesis\u201d in power. \u201cEverything will be judged with the enforcement of real government policy which will not only be the agreement,\u201d the interior minister Nikos Voutsis said this morning. Calling the proposed deal \u201cvery difficult, very bad,\u201d the minister said the real issue the government faced would be finding and enacting policies that could have an ameliorating affect on the painful consequences the measures were likely to have socially. \u201cSocial counter-measures must be found which will give hope to people.\u201d Britain won\u2019t contribute any money to the Greek bailout, declared UK chancellor George Osborne as he arrived at today\u2019s meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels. He told reporters: Britain is not in the euro, so the idea that British taxpayers will be on the line for this Greek deal is a complete non-starter. The eurozone needs to foot its own bill. As explained earlier, Britain is adamant that it won\u2019t let the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) be used to underwrite short-term loans to Greece (as this would break an earlier deal between the UK and Brussels). So Osborne\u2019s taking a tough line, and he wants us to know it. And if the idea really isn\u2019t possible, it won\u2019t do the chancellor any harm to claim a victory on away soil against the eurocrats (especially if it really isn\u2019t legally possible anyway). Finland\u2019s finance minister Alex Stubb agrees that bridge financing is a problem, as eurozone countries can\u2019t just hand over funds to Greece without \u2018conditionality\u2019 But it is probably impossible to back down at this stage, so some kind of agreement will be found, Stubb replies. Perhaps bilateral loans to Greece? Europe is battling to find a way to provide \u2018bridge financing\u2019 to help Greece meet its short-term funding demands, while a third bailout is agreed. Arriving at today\u2019s ECOFIN meeting, Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem said officials are still working on a way to help Athens meet its repayments to ECB this summer, starting on July 20. What\u2019s holding it up? We are looking at all the instruments and funds that we could use, Dijsselbloem replies. They all seem to have disadvantages or impossibilities or legal objections, so we\u2019re still working on it. Syriza parliamentary group spokesman Nikos Filis has urged MPs to support Tsipras -- warning that they would otherwise be allying with Greece\u2019s enemies in Brussels. He told reporters: \u201cWasn\u2019t what happened in Brussels a coup? What happened? Didn\u2019t they say, either this deal or we take Greeks\u2019 deposits and the banks go bankrupt? The government came under threat from economic and political forces that do not forgive the Greek people for making a different choice. I think that, often, we facilitate these plans. We cannot end with a left interregnum with the complicity of people of the left.\u201d Finland\u2019s finance minister tweets that he\u2019s still hopeful of a happy ending to the crisis: European stock markets are lacklustre in early trading. The initial relief that Grexit had been avoided has tailed away, as investors consider the political hurdles ahead. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, explains: Fresh from his mental \u2018crucifixion\u2019 at the EU summit, Alexis Tsipras has another few tortuous days ahead of him as he tries to stem a growing left-wing rebellion in his own party, all in order to pass legislation by Wednesday that will go some way to unlocking a third bailout. Some are already speculating that inter-party issues over the weekend\u2019s Greek deal could lead to a much-touted, and no doubt Germany pleasing, Tsipras resignation. UK chancellor George Osborne is expected to fight efforts to make Britain contribute to the Greek bailout, at today\u2019s ECOFIN meeting of finance ministers. The British government isn\u2019t impressed that the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) would underwrite the deal. That would break an agreement that the EFSM (funded by all 28 EU members) wouldn\u2019t fund eurozone bailouts again. Here\u2019s the story: In a fresh sign of political turmoil in Athens, an influential Greek minister has demanded that Alexis Tsipras withdraws the bailout deal agreed in Brussels. Energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, who leads Syriza\u2019s Left Platform, has released a statement damming the agreement as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Lafazanis said the deal \u201ccancels the popular mandate and the proud \u2018NO\u2019 of the Greek people in the referendum\u201d. \u201cOur so-called partners led by the German establishment, behaved towards our country as being their colony and they are nothing more than brutal blackmailers and financial assassins.\u201d (thanks to Enikos for the quotes) Lafazanis was already on thin ice after abstaining in Friday night\u2019s vote on the Greek government\u2019s proposals to its creditors. And the Left Platform\u2019s position will be crucial in determining whether Tsipras holds onto power. As Bloomberg TV\u2019s Matt Campbell (in Athens today) points out, few people want to take bets on whether Tsipras\u2019s government survives for long. Syriza\u2019s own parliamentary spokesman has described the deal forced on Greece at the Euro Summit as a \u201ccoup\u201d, according to Reuters: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of Greece\u2019s financial crisis. Political tensions are bubbling away in Athens this morning after the Greek government caved in at last weekend\u2019s Brussels summit in the hope of receiving a third bailout deal. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s decision to accept even deeper austerity, sweeping economic reforms, and the sequestering of \u20ac50bn of prime Greek assets for privatisation has enraged many in his own Syriza party. The prime minister is meeting his MPs this morning, with speculation swirling that he could possibly resign soon if there is a major rebellion over the measures forced on Greece at the Euro Summit. The deal forced on Tsipras during his night of pain in Brussels compels Greece to pass legislation by Wednesday night. Although some opposition parties will probably back the plan, the Greek leader\u2019s authority could be badly dented if his own MPs refuse to approve measures which they campaigned against. While Tsipras locks horns with his leftwingers, European finance ministers will be meeting in Brussels for an ECOFIN meeting later this morning. And in the UK, Bank of England governor Mark Carney will face questions over Greece when he testifies at parliament. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

This is due to the easing of policies during the last year, with the recent deterioration in the domestic macroeconomic and financial environment because of the closure of the banking system adding significantly to the adverse dynamics. </p> <p>The financing need through end-2018 is now estimated at \u20ac85bn and debt is expected to peak at close to 200 percent of GDP in the next two years, provided that there is an early agreement on a program. Greece\u2019s debt can now only be made sustainable through debt relief measures that go far beyond what Europe has been willing to consider so far. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The IMF\u2019s fundamental conclusion is that Greece will simply not be able to borrow at affordable rates again, until its debt burden is lower.</strong></p> <p>The situation was already bad - but recent developments make it much, much worse.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> The events of the past two weeks\u2014the closure of banks and imposition of capital controls\u2014are extracting a heavy toll on the banking system and the economy, leading to a further significant deterioration in debt sustainability relative to what was projected in our recently published DSA.</p> </blockquote> <p>Today\u2019s report is light on projections, but the ones included are stark enough. The stand-out fact: Greek debt is on track to peak at close to 200% of GDP in the next two years. Only Japan, after two lost decades, comes close to that ratio.</p> <p><strong>Perhaps this is why the US government, led by Treasury secretary Jack Lew, has been so vocal about the need for debt sustainability to be addressed?</strong></p> <p>The IMF is also amusingly sniffy about the targets Greece is being set. For example:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong> Medium-term primary surplus target:</strong> Greece is expected to maintain primary surpluses for the next several decades of 3.5 percent of GDP. Few countries have managed to do so. The reversal of key public sector reforms already in place\u2014 notably pension and civil service reforms\u2014without yet any specification of alternative reforms raises concerns about Greece\u2019s ability to reach this target </p> </blockquote> <p>But it\u2019s conclusion is clear - if Europe wants this bailout to work, it must either grant Greece three decades grace before repaying its debts, or cut the face value of its borrowings, deeply....</p> <p>And on that note, we\u2019re going to shut down for the night.

I understand that position. And I also care first and foremost about the Greek people. The future programme will have to strike a balance between economic necessity and political reality. If excessive mistrust led us to ask the impossible of Greece would be damaging for all. I hope we give Greece a chance to prove its good faith, and that the future programme allows the country to raise its head economically and politically.</p> <p>Still, we lost six months.

Are you looking at that issue and the vulnerability of the IMF itself?\u201d</em></p> <p><strong>Carney</strong>: \u201cI think it is important to recognise the preferred creditor status of the IMF and that any contemplated extension adjustment to the debt of Greece should respect that.

We worked with - in recent days, weeks, months - with the IMF to offer independent perspective on some of these issues, potential solutions to these issues in an effort to be helpful. The Fund is dealing with an extremely fluid situation obviously in Greece and I\u2019ll just reiterate that there is no simple solution as you can appreciate...

    "webTitle": "Athens to vote as IMF warns Greece needs extra debt relief above bailout", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has warned that Greece will require far more generous debt relief than is currently on offer from its creditors, as MPs in Athens prepare for a crucial vote on Wednesday on a new bailout plan. An IMF report leaked to Reuters shows that Greece\u2019s public debt is likely to peak at 200% of its national income within the next two years, with the risk that the actual outcome could be even worse. The debt sustainability analysis comes on the eve of a crucial vote in the Greek parliament, when the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, will seek approval for the fresh austerity measures demanded by the eurozone in return for a three-year rescue package worth up to \u20ac86bn (\u00a361bn). The report highlights the IMF\u2019s scepticism about Greece\u2019s ability to meet the ultra-tough budget targets insisted upon by its European creditors, and suggests that Athens should receive a 30-year grace period before it has to start paying off its debts. Putting into question the fund\u2019s involvement in the bailout, the report paints a far darker picture of Greece\u2019s public finances than that contained in the blueprint released at the end of the marathon eurozone leaders\u2019 summit on Monday. \u201cThe dramatic deterioration in debt sustainability points to the need for debt relief on a scale that would need to go well beyond what has been under consideration to date \u2013 and what has been proposed by the ESM,\u201d the IMF said, referring to the European stability mechanism bailout fund, which will be used to bankroll the Greek bailout. The IMF last issued an update on Greece two weeks ago, but its new assessment comes after a period when cash withdrawals from banks have been limited to \u20ac60 a day and businesses have been starved of working capital. The closure of banks and the introduction of capital controls were \u201cextracting a heavy toll on the banking system and the economy, leading to a further significant deterioration in debt sustainability relative to what was projected in our recently published DSA,\u201d the IMF said. Two weeks ago, the fund estimated that Greek debt would peak at 177% of GDP and fall to 142% by 2022. It now believes the debt ratio will still be 170% in 2022 after hitting a peak of 200%. The IMF has consistently urged deeper debt relief throughout the Greek crisis, but has met resistance from European finance ministers, who have been unwilling to make their taxpayers pay the cost of a write down. Tsipras has also insisted that debt relief must form an important part of the package, but a statement by Eurozone leaders on Monday said only that further measures might be taken provided Greece adhered in full to the reforms demanded by its creditors. In the leaked report, the IMF says that Greece\u2019s debts threaten to be unsustainable for decades, and that its financing needs will rise so that they are above the 15% of national income level deemed safe. The IMF adds that unless European creditors agree to an extended grace period, they face the choice of either annual transfers to the Greek budget, or \u201cdeep upfront haircuts\u201d, the term for the cancellation of part of the debt. IMF sources confirmed that an updated debt sustainability analysis had been prepared by staff and would be discussed by the organisation\u2019s executive board. Unless the IMF can convince itself that Greece\u2019s debts are sustainable, it would be forbidden by its own rules to put money into a new bailout. The assumption has been that the fund would provide \u20ac16.4bn \u2013 around 25% of the total \u2013 with the rest coming from the ESM. The European commission, one of Greece\u2019s three creditors alongside the IMF and the European Central Bank, sought to play down the report. A commission spokeswoman said that the IMF and the commission had together signed off on a different debt sustainability document. This was the paper sent to eurozone finance ministers on Saturday and formed the basis for the bailout agreement signed off by eurozone leaders on Monday morning, she said. Reports of renewed IMF concerns came as Tsipras tried to convince dissident MPs in his own Syriza party to back another round of austerity. Ahead of the make-or-break vote in Athens\u2019s parliament, Tsipras held back-to-back meetings as he attempted to rally support for measures at total variance with the rationale of his radical left party. Creditors have given the Greek government until Wednesday to push controversial reforms, including sales tax increases and pension reforms, through parliament. Appalled by Tsipras\u2019s volte-face, an estimated 35 Syriza MPs signalled on Tuesday night that they would vote against the measures, arguing that the \u201crecessionary policies\u201d will only worsen the record levels of poverty and unemployment Greece has already suffered. Panagiotis Lafazanis, the energy minister who heads Syriza\u2019s Left Platform, implored the prime minister to turn down the terms. He called the proposals the work of \u201ceconomic murderers\u201d intent on destroying Greece. Even if it was endorsed by the 300-seat House with the help of opposition parties \u2013 as seems likely \u2013 \u201cit will never be passed by the people who effectively will eradicate it with their unity and struggles,\u201d Lafazanis said. With Tsipras\u2019 own position looking increasingly vulnerable, the country appears headed for fresh political tumult. On Tuesday night government insiders insisted the prime minister had no intention of standing down, saying he would probably attempt to clear the political terrain with a cabinet reshuffle on Thursday. Tsipras told public television last night: \u201cThe worst thing a captain could do while he is steering a ship during a storm, as difficult as it is, would be to abandon the helm.\u201d But if losses are heavy, and he loses his parliamentary majority, the young leader might also be forced to from a cross-party government of national unity. \u201cPolitical developments inside Syriza will be rapid and dramatic,\u201d said professor Dimitris Keridis who teaches political science at Athens\u2019 Panteion University. \u201cBut we will see a realignment in Greek parliamentary politics in support of the deal which, hopefully, will be cathartic and provide stability,\u201d he said. \u201cTsipras is being asked to pay for the sins of a previous political class. The great irony is a radical leftist will now have to impose all the reforms that were never passed before, neo-liberal measures that he has always opposed.\u201d The neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party quickly sought to capitalise on the popular anger that the deal is bound to unleash. \u201cGolden Dawn will resist the new memorandum that the government of the left will sign with the complete support of New Democracy, To Potami and Pasok,\u201d said the organisation\u2019s leader Nikos Michaloliakos, referring to the opposition parties. \u201cAn avalanche of taxes is coming. New annihilating measures that will mainly affect the country\u2019s youth, that will increase unemployment and hit farmers who are the soul of the nation, are coming. From every place in this land the battle will continue \u2026 so that the plans of foreign rule are not passed.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The former HSBC boss Lord Green has admitted the bank should have made more stringent checks before buying its Swiss private banking arm, as he apologised for failures at the disgraced UK-based bank. Green, who was HSBC\u2019s chief executive between 2003 and 2006 and then chairman until 2010, told members of the House of Lords economic affairs committee on Tuesday that neither he nor the senior management team had been aware of the problems at the Swiss private bank, which engulfed HSBC in a scandal at the beginning of the year after the Guardian and other publications revealed it had helped wealthy clients avoid taxes. In the biggest banking data leak in history, the so-called HSBC files, which cover the period 2005-07, shone some light on about 30,000 accounts holding almost $120bn (\u00a378bn) in assets. Speaking in detail for the first time on the scandal, Green said: \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight \u2013 and this was complicated by Swiss law which prevented [HSBC\u2019s board] seeing client details \u2013 it would have been good to know details of this earlier and we didn\u2019t get everything right.\u201d Green, who left HSBC to become trade minister in 2011, added: \u201cIt would have been better to have drilled into the detail much earlier.\u201d When asked by the committee chairman, Lord Hollick, about \u201cindustrial-scale systems of tax evasion\u201d at the bank, Green added: \u201cWe were very conscious there were going to be issues in the private bank. That there would be considerable need for work on, for example, politically exposed persons. \u201cI am not sure to what extent the due diligence at the time revealed issues of non-compliance. I do not believe that anybody was aware of the \u2013 to use your phrase \u2013 industrial-scale systems of tax evasion. \u201cWe became aware of this situation, the extent of it, only in around 2010. Indeed the kind of activity that was described in the media reports earlier this year I was certainly not aware of before we read about them in the media reports, and I don\u2019t think any other member of the senior management group was either.\u201d The Conservative peer also appeared to acknowledge that the bank\u2019s own staff had warned the board about separate problems in its international divisions, including its acquired Mexican bank that was hit by a \u00a31.2bn fine from the US authorities in 2012 to settle allegations it allowed drug traffickers and terrorists to move money around the financial system. Green said he regretted not paying more attention to internal reports highlighting potential problems. When asked by Hollick if he had been surprised by the \u201clack of scepticism and questioning\u201d by the HSBC board over foreign acquisitions, Green replied: \u201cThings should have been done differently with the benefit of hindsight. There was insufficiently robust implementation of audit reports [which are provided to the board to assess risk]. \u201cClearly we didn\u2019t identify the anti-money laundering work needed to be done. I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d In 2012 US prosecutors said HSBC was guilty of a \u201cblatant failure\u201d to implement anti-money laundering controls and wilfully flouted US sanctions. The bank\u2019s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said at the time he was \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d for the failures, as assistant attorney general Lanny Breuer said Mexican drug traffickers laundered at least $881m throughout the bank\u2019s accounts. Breuer said at the time: \u201cHSBC is being held accountable for stunning failures of oversight \u2013 and worse \u2013 that led the bank to permit narcotics traffickers and others to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through HSBC subsidiaries and to facilitate hundreds of millions more in transactions with sanctioned countries.\u201d Green, who still insisted he was \u201cproud of HSBC\u201d despite \u201cnot getting everything right\u201d, gave his evidence alongside Sir Win Bischoff, the veteran banker who is a former chairman of Lloyds Banking Group and currently chairman of the Financial Reporting Council. Bischoff said he believed individuals found guilty of wrongdoing in the financial sector should face legal sanctions, as well as their employers. \u201cIt\u2019s not the institution that got things wrong,\u201d he said, describing banks as inanimate objects. Green later agreed with him and said that there now existed a \u201cmuch clearer legal framework\u201d to accomplish this.",

So, in essence, the IMF is saying the plan will not achieve one of its primary goals of allowing Greece to fund itself in financial markets within a few years. Even if the country succeeds in implementing the market reforms, VAT increases and pension cuts demanded in Monday\u2019s agreement, the debt will still be too big to service. Instead, eurozone lenders will have one of three options, according to the IMF, which, naturally, is not volunteering to take a financial hit on its own loans. They could give Greece a 30-year grace period on servicing all its European debt. They could make fiscal transfers. Or they could accept \u201cdeep upfront haircuts\u201d on loans, meaning cancellation of part of the debt. The last of those was explicitly ruled out on Monday. Fiscal transfers would be politically impossible. So that leaves a grace period on repayments. This was mentioned on Monday, but only as a \u201cpossible additional measure\u201d once all reforms have been implemented. There was no hint from eurozone lenders that a grace period as long as 30 years might be contemplated. There is, of course, a complication. In IMF eyes, the need for debt relief is so great partly because Greece\u2019s economy has been mismanaged. Eurozone lenders would argue that granting upfront relief is therefore nonsensical; Greece must first prove it is serious about reform. Therein lies a huge debate. Yet IMF rules are supposed to be clear. The organisation only lends to a country when it can see a clear path back to debt sustainability. If the eurozone won\u2019t grant debt relief in advance, why should the IMF chip in its \u20ac16.4bn contribution to the latest bailout? Surely it can\u2019t. Budget fallout The stink caused by George Osborne\u2019s decision to cancel renewable power generators\u2019 exemption from the climate change levy grows stronger. Here is Neil Woodford, the type of long-term investor one assumes the government would like to attract to help fund big infrastructure projects: \u201cI have to conclude that the government has either failed to understand the implications of this policy change, or wilfully ignored the interests of capital providers in this vital industry. Long-term capital projects need consistency that extends way beyond the length of a political cycle.\u201d Woodford is an interested party, it should be said. His fund is a big investor in Drax, whose shares have fallen 30% since last week\u2019s budget. Drax qualified for an exemption because it is converting its dirty coal-fired stations into a biomass-burning operation. Biomass \u2013 wood pellets, in Drax\u2019s case \u2013 is not every green lobbyist\u2019s idea of a sustainable fuel. But there\u2019s no doubt that the UK government encouraged its use, presumably for two good reasons: biomass is cheaper than many renewables and, unlike wind and solar, can be relied upon in all weathers. Woodford calculates that Drax has spent \u00a31bn, at present values, building \u201cEurope\u2019s largest renewable energy project\u201d. His point is that investors committed their capital because they believed they would be allowed to earn an attractive long-term return. Exemption from the climate change levy was meant to be part of that deal. Plus, exemption made sense because renewable energy has the same policy objective as the levy: reducing the UK\u2019s carbon emissions. Removal of the exemption will cost Drax \u00a360m in lost profit next year, the company said last week, enough to undermine the economics of an investment that was delivered on time and on budget. \u201cIt is probable that Drax\u2019s shareholders would have been better off if the company had simply continued to generate power by burning coal,\u201d says Woodford. That\u2019s a damning verdict. Drax, love it or hate it, generates 7%-8% of the country\u2019s energy. If the chancellor can remove subsidies retrospectively from such a critical piece of UK infrastructure, there will be consequences. Woodford is right: \u201cIf government cannot be trusted to fulfil its long-term commitments, then it will have to accept that it cannot rely on support from institutional investors. That would not be a good outcome for the UK economy.\u201d No insight You wait ages for Stephen Green to appear before a parliamentary committee, and then the event is a complete letdown. The former chief executive and chairman of HSBC did his duty by apologising and confessing that \u201cwe didn\u2019t get everything right\u201d in Mexico and Switzerland. But the members of House of Lords economic affairs committee failed to gain any real insight into why, for example, the bank didn\u2019t act on warnings from US and Mexican regulators in 2007-08 that only money laundering by drug cartels could explain the size of transfers of cash between HSBC Mexico and HSBC US.

The weaker state\u2019s representatives invoke quaint notions such as justice and freedom in their arguments against personal and financial enslavement, but this is met with a lecture on the harsh truths of realpolitik (as we might call it): that questions of justice are only relevant \u201cbetween those with an equal power to enforce it\u201d, and that the sole question of relevance is \u201cone of self-preservation \u2013 that is, not resisting those who are far stronger than you\u201d. In the hope that they might somehow preserve their independence, the weaker state declines the offer then on the table, that of enslavement, only to be faced with no choice at all: their adult males are killed, their women and children enslaved, and their land and property expropriated. Such was the story told by Thucydides of the treatment of Melos by the imperial state of Athens in 416-15BC. While any parallels with current events must be drawn with caution (who could imagine that a modern European nation would impose collective punishment on its weaker brethren?), it is perhaps worth mentioning as a footnote that the Athenian empire was only to survive its destruction of Melos for little over a decade. Dr Terry Peach University of Manchester \u2022 Yanis Varoufakis is right to suggest that the austerity deal that Greek prime minister Alexis Tspiras is attempting, parliament willing, to sign up to has a parallel with the 1919 Treaty of Versailles (Tsipras on course to steer EU bailout plan through parliament, 14 July). The outcome now is likely to be the rise of the fascist Golden Dawn in Greece. When the IMF forced a cuts package on the UK with the agreement of the Labour government in 1976, one result was the growth of the National Front. Accepting austerity not only brings cuts and joblessness, but fascists too. Keith Flett London \u2022 Let us hope that at least one Greek MP will have the historical nous to quote the German social democrat prime minister Philipp Scheidemann, calling on his fellow deputies to reject the draconian Treaty of Versailles, imposed on Germany by the allies in August 1919: \u201cWhat hand would not wither that bound itself and us with these fetters?\u201d Then perhaps Germany\u2019s politicians will remember the catastrophe nourished by this act of political revenge. Jane Caplan Emeritus professor of modern European history, University of Oxford \u2022 When a part of government fails in a political union, however loose the union, the larger side should not punish the people in the failed area: it should sort out the mis-government. The latest hardball by Germany in the Grecian tragedy (Europe takes revenge on Tsipras, 13 July) suggests a Europe lacking both empathy and understanding of cultural differences. It will ease the task of the Tory right in persuading the UK to leave the EU. For the first time in almost 50 years I, committed to the European idea and a leftwing Germanophile, find the best reason for staying in Europe is to tame Germany. How sad. Andy Jordan Wirksworth, Derbyshire \u2022 In 1966 Alexander Dub\u010dek was humiliated in Moscow after the \u201cfraternal assistance\u201d of the Soviet bloc: the end of \u201csocialism with a human face\u201d. In 2015 Alexis Tsipras was humiliated in Brussels: the end of democratic socialism in Europe. Thucydides\u2019 account of the Melian dialogue is pertinent; within a few years the Athenian empire was at an end. Unless the European Union moves away from neoliberalism it will also collapse. Dr Geoffrey Allen London \u2022 Larry Elliott is right to say that rather than crushing Greece\u2019s economy and democracy, there should instead be a massive debt write-off and a return to sustainable economic activity in that cruelly ruined country (Condemned to debtors\u2019 prison, barely a chink of light filtering through its bars, 14 July). This could be achieved by the European Central Bank rediscovering its purpose of ensuring the EU\u2019s economic stability. It is in the process of e-printing a staggering \u20ac1.1tn of quantitative easing (QE), and should immediately introduce \u201cJubilee QE\u201d to pay off much of Greece\u2019s debts to its creditors. It could then help revitalise the Greek economy by introducing \u201cGreen Infrastructure QE\u201d \u2013 akin to the \u201cPeople\u2019s QE\u201d that Jeremy Corbyn has called on all the Labour leadership candidates to endorse for the UK.

      "bodyText": "The German discount supermarket chain Aldi has stolen a march on rivals in Britain by throwing its weight behind a groundbreaking national initiative to back British farmers. It is the first retailer to sign up to a so-called fruit and veg pledge drawn up by the National Farmers Union, which aims to improve long-term relationships with British growers and suppliers, boosting their profitability. The code includes a commitment to supplying seasonal British fruit and vegetables and stripping out bureaucracy and unfair charges. Aldi has committed to providing promotions that will not be financed by growers, overturning the traditional supermarket model that relies on direct funding from suppliers. The grocer has pledged to operate simple agreements with no penalty rates of mechanisms to reclaim money if sales fail to live up to expectations. It agreed not to charge suppliers for late or missed deliveries or make deductions for customer complaints. Such charges have been a huge concern for the industry, to the extent that the Groceries Code Adjudicator launched an investigation into customer complaint charges and recently produced a best practice report for the industry to adopt. The farmers\u2019 union is calling on all retailers to sign up publicly to the pledge, which has taken three years to draw up since the publication of its Catalyst for Change report. The study found millions of pounds had been stripped out of the fresh produce sector through poor supply chain practices and a short-term approach to relationships with growers and intermediaries, damaging farmers\u2019 ability to produce fruit and vegetables. Dr Chris Hartfield, the NFU\u2019s chief horticultural adviser, said: \u201cWe have been talking to numerous retailers and Aldi is the first to sign up publicly. The pledge is a real breakthrough \u2013 it is about stripping out unwieldy bureaucracy and charges and minimising market volatility for smaller suppliers, which can kill off their businesses. We hope other supermarkets will sign up very soon and we encourage them to do so. This will benefit everyone in the supply chain, from growers to shoppers.\u201d The German-owned discount chain may seem an unlikely champion of British brassicas and beetroot. Renowned for its flash sales of unexpected items such as ski poles as well as economically priced continental cheeses and meats, Aldi is currently the fastest growing grocer in the UK and overtook Waitrose to become the UK\u2019s sixth largest in March. According to the NFU, British fresh produce is worth more than \u00a33bn every year to the British economy. Last year, more than 40% of Aldi\u2019s fresh produce was British, significantly more than the industry average of about 35%. Aldi has grown to become the fourth largest retailer of fresh produce in the UK \u2013 with a 13% share of the market \u2013 and is set to become the third largest. Tony Baines, managing director of buying at Aldi, said: \u201cTrue to our family values, we treat growers and packers across the UK equally and fairly. This allows us to build long-term and sustainable relationships with them, which in turn enables our customers to benefit from unbeatable prices and quality. \u201dThe transparency and fairness with which we treat all our suppliers was recently recognised by the Groceries Code Adjudicator\u2019s annual supplier survey, which named Aldi as the best performing grocery retailer for compliance.\u201d Retailers have been doing more to ensure less waste of British produce, including relaxing their product specifications to allow the sale of more \u201cwonky\u201d fruit and vegetables in store. In January, Asda trialled a pilot selling mishapen produce which has since been extended after being embraced by consumers. The NFU said it had been involved in negotiations with other major UK retailers, including Tesco, the largest. The chain is poised to announce a new agriculture director to replace Tom Hind \u2013 who was poached from the NFU \u2013 and who is stepping down little more than 18 months after taking on the role.",

      "bodyText": "The time is nearing to raise interest rates in the UK and waiting too long will mean having to increase them more sharply in the end, departing Bank of England policymaker David Miles has said. In his final speech as an external member of the Bank committee that sets interest rates, Miles also warned investors against looking to other central banks\u2019 moves for clues as to how UK policymakers will act. As investors position for interest rates to start rising in the major economies after years of ultra-loose policy ushered in by the financial crisis, many have looked to the US Federal Reserve to take a lead. But Miles dismissed this approach. \u201cOne thing the monetary policy committee [MPC] will not do, and never has, is just follow another big central bank; it is a daft idea that we cannot raise rates in the UK before the US and also cannot be long behind them,\u201d Miles said in a speech to the Resolution Foundation thinktank on Tuesday. Citing low unemployment, wage rises, solid economic growth and improving confidence among consumers and businesses, Miles echoed earlier remarks by the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, and said the time to start taking rates back to more normal levels was \u201csoon\u201d. Miles also implied interest rates could be around 3% in two years or so to keep growth and inflation on track. \u201cNow is closer to the right time to start a gentle amble back towards a more normal setting for monetary policy,\u201d Miles said. The economist joined the MPC in June 2009 after the Bank had already slashed interest rates to the current record low of 0.5%. Miles has not once voted for a move in either direction in interest rates in more than 70 policy meetings at the Bank, although the voting from the latest July meeting is not yet public and he has one more vote to go in August. The remarks in Miles\u2019s speech suggest he could yet vote for a rise. \u201cThe case for beginning a gradual normalisation in the stance of monetary policy is stronger than at any time since I joined the committee over six years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWaiting too long to start on a path back to a more sustainable rate is a bad mistake. What you really need to avoid is sharp rises in interest rates. The cost of raising interest rate sharply is particularly high in the UK, where a large proportion of household debt is in the form of variable interest rate mortgages and where many people would struggle to adjust to sudden and significant rises in monthly payments. \u201cGiven that, and given that many of the after-effects of the mess of 2008 do seem to have faded (for example, the drying up of bank credit), I think a first move up in Bank rate soon is likely to be right.\u201d He appeared to rebut comments by the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, that lifting rates too soon risks being self-defeating and tipping the UK back into recession. \u201cI do not attach great weight to the idea that starting this process will create great risks of dropping back into very weak growth, falling into negative inflation and engendering a splurge in risk-avoiding behaviour,\u201d said Miles. \u201cI attach more weight to the risks of waiting too long and then not being able to take a gradual path to a more normal stance for monetary policy.\u201d Miles has often been characterised as a dove for not voting for higher rates nor expressing concern over loose policy. But he dismissed such labels as \u201cpish-posh\u201d. \u201cThe hawk/dove labels are pretty silly because they suggest some unchanging genetic tendency towards favouring one type of policy; anyone who was like that would be very ill suited to be on the MPC,\u201d he said. Miles\u2019s comments on interest rates closely mirrored Carney\u2019s remarks earlier on Tuesday that \u201cthe point at which interest rates may begin to rise is moving closer\u201d. Those comments lifted the pound against the dollar and the euro as investors adjusted their positions to factor in the chances of a rate rise before the end of this year.",

    "webTitle": "Osborne resists use of UK-backed EU fund for Greek emergency loan", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Europe is split over whether Greece could be offered an emergency loan from a central EU fund in a move that could require around \u00a3850m of financial support from the UK. George Osborne, the chancellor, is furiously opposing the idea, saying it is a \u201cnon-starter\u201d, but the European commission confirmed it was under consideration in spite of British objections and German scepticism about the plan. Osborne is arguing only eurozone countries should participate in the Greek bailout, so it would be wrong to tap the central EU fund set up in 2010 to help Ireland and Portugal, which is known as the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM). Using this source of cash as an emergency bridging loan until a longer-term bailout plan is put in place would leave the UK out of pocket if Greece failed to repay it. Osborne\u2019s argument was boosted when the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, said it would \u201cnot be appropriate\u201d to use the fund when some non-eurozone member states were against. The Czech Republic also registered objections. However, the European commission likes the idea of using the EFSM, because funds can be unlocked relatively quickly with a qualified majority vote, meaning it cannot be blocked by Britain and the Czechs alone. The proposal was not officially tabled at the meeting of EU finance ministers on Tuesday, but a working group looked at the issue among a number of proposals and eurozone finance ministers will discuss the options at a conference call on Wednesday. After the Ecofin finance ministers\u2019 meeting, Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner in charge of the euro, confirmed that a loan to Greece from the EFSM was still being considered. He said: \u201cAll options are quite complicated, either legally or politically or financially, but we need to find a solution as soon as possible.\u201d A Treasury source said: \u201cDuring Ecofin and in the margins, the chancellor couldn\u2019t have been clearer. We are immovable on this. British taxpayers\u2019 cash must be protected. We will try to be constructive but this is a eurozone bailout.\u201d Eurozone officials have been scrambling to come up with \u20ac12bn (\u00a38.5bn) in emergency funds for Greece until an \u20ac86bn three-year bailout is in place. Work to reach agreement on the long-term bailout could take four weeks, but Greece is almost bankrupt. The Greek government has to pay debts worth \u20ac7bn in July, plus a further \u20ac5bn by mid August. If Athens fails to repay \u20ac3.5bn to the European Central Bank on Monday 20 July, the Greek financial system could collapse. On top of that, a leaked International Monetary Fund (IMF) report seen by Reuters warned that Greece would need debt relief far beyond what has been proposed so far. The UK government argues that use of the EFSM would break a deal made between the commission and EU member states in 2010 that funds cannot be used to shore up the financial stability of the eurozone. But the commission thinks the UK has misunderstood that agreement: it argues there is nothing to prevent use of EFSM funds to help one member state. The Labour MEP, Richard Corbett, said British taxpayers were very unlikely to lose money. \u201cThe risks to British taxpayers\u2019 liability is actually very small indeed, although I understand why he [Osborne] doesn\u2019t want to create a precedent.\u201d Along with other EU member states, the UK would be providing a credit guarantee, rather than a direct loan. But the Treasury could be liable for \u00a31bn if Greece failed to repay the EFSM fund. Corbett said the issue was not helpful to the debate over Britain\u2019s EU membership, although it was minor compared to the real issues facing the UK. \u201cThis is a trivial sum in terms of what is at stake in terms of our membership of the European Union, especially as it is not a sum we are ever likely to pay.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s official spokeswoman said on Tuesday that Cameron did not believe that UK cash should be on the line and there was currently no proposal on the table for this to happen. Osborne said earlier that he would block any EU move to draw on an emergency fund containing British money for the new bailout programme. Arriving in Brussels for a meeting of European finance ministers, Osborne said: \u201cBritain is not in the euro, so the idea that British taxpayers will be on the line for this Greek deal is a complete non-starter. The eurozone needs to foot its own bill.\u201d Eurozone leaders struck a deal on Monday to prevent Greece from leaving the euro in return for a pledge from Athens to enact major reforms in the coming days. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has vowed to secure parliamentary approval after accepting a third bailout programme that came at the end of exhaustive talks with EU leaders. Britain, however, has been alarmed about the possibility of having to participate, leading the chancellor to hold a series of telephone conversations with his counterparts ahead of Tuesday\u2019s meeting to emphasise his opposition.",

      "body": "<p>Europe is split over whether Greece could be offered an emergency loan from a central EU fund in a move that could require around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/greece-crisis-osborne-seeks-to-block-use-of-british-backed-fund-in-bailout\">\u00a3850m of financial support from the UK</a>.</p> <p>George Osborne, the chancellor, is furiously opposing the idea, saying it is a \u201cnon-starter\u201d, but the European commission confirmed it was under consideration in spite of British objections and German scepticism about the plan.</p> <p>Osborne is arguing only eurozone countries should participate in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/13/greece-bailout-agreement-key-points-grexit\">Greek bailout</a>, so it would be wrong to tap the central EU fund set up in 2010 to help Ireland and Portugal, which is known as the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM). </p> <p>Using this source of cash as an emergency bridging loan until a longer-term bailout plan is put in place would leave the UK out of pocket if Greece failed to repay it.</p> <p>Osborne\u2019s argument was boosted when the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, said it would \u201cnot be appropriate\u201d to use the fund when some non-eurozone member states were against. The Czech Republic also registered objections.</p> <p>However, the European commission likes the idea of using the EFSM, because funds can be unlocked relatively quickly with a qualified majority vote, meaning it cannot be blocked by Britain and the Czechs alone. </p> <p>The proposal was not officially tabled at the meeting of EU finance ministers on Tuesday, but a working group looked at the issue among a number of proposals and eurozone finance ministers will discuss the options at a conference call on Wednesday.</p> <p>After the Ecofin finance ministers\u2019 meeting, Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner in charge of the euro, confirmed that a loan to Greece from the EFSM was still being considered. <br></p> <p>He said: \u201cAll options are quite complicated, either legally or politically or financially, but we need to find a solution as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>A Treasury source said: \u201cDuring Ecofin and in the margins, the chancellor couldn\u2019t have been clearer. We are immovable on this. British taxpayers\u2019 cash must be protected. We will try to be constructive but this is a eurozone bailout.\u201d</p> <p>Eurozone officials have been scrambling to come up with \u20ac12bn (\u00a38.5bn) in emergency funds for Greece until an \u20ac86bn three-year bailout is in place. </p> <p>Work to reach agreement on the long-term bailout could take four weeks, but Greece is almost bankrupt. </p> <p>The Greek government has to pay debts worth \u20ac7bn in July, plus a further \u20ac5bn by mid August. If Athens fails to repay \u20ac3.5bn to the European Central Bank on Monday 20 July, the Greek financial system could collapse.<br></p> <p>On top of that, a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/14/us-eurozone-greece-imf-report-idUSKCN0PO1CB20150714\">leaked International Monetary Fund (IMF) report seen by Reuters</a> warned that Greece would need debt relief far beyond what has been proposed so far.</p> <p>The UK government argues that use of the EFSM would break a deal made between the commission and EU member states in 2010 that funds cannot be used to shore up the financial stability of the eurozone. </p> <p>But the commission thinks the UK has misunderstood that agreement: it argues there is nothing to prevent use of EFSM funds to help one member state.<br></p> <p>The Labour MEP, Richard Corbett, said British taxpayers were very unlikely to lose money. \u201cThe risks to British taxpayers\u2019 liability is actually very small indeed, although I understand why he [Osborne] doesn\u2019t want to create a precedent.\u201d<br></p> <p>Along with other EU member states, the UK would be providing a credit guarantee, rather than a direct loan. But the Treasury could be liable for \u00a31bn if Greece failed to repay the EFSM fund.<br></p> <p>Corbett said the issue was not helpful to the debate over Britain\u2019s EU membership, although it was minor compared to the real issues facing the UK.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis is a trivial sum in terms of what is at stake in terms of our membership of the European Union, especially as it is not a sum we are ever likely to pay.\u201d</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s official spokeswoman said on Tuesday that Cameron did not believe that UK cash should be on the line and there was currently no proposal on the table for this to happen.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Osborne said earlier that he would block any EU move to draw on an emergency fund containing British money for the new bailout programme.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Arriving in Brussels for a meeting of European finance ministers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/greece-crisis-osborne-seeks-to-block-use-of-british-backed-fund-in-bailout\">Osborne said</a>: \u201cBritain is not in the euro, so the idea that British taxpayers will be on the line for this Greek deal is a complete non-starter. The eurozone needs to foot its own bill.\u201d</p> <p>Eurozone leaders struck a deal on Monday to prevent Greece from leaving the euro in return for a pledge from Athens to enact major reforms in the coming days.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has vowed to secure parliamentary approval after accepting a third bailout programme that came at the end of exhaustive talks with EU leaders.</p> <p>Britain, however, has been alarmed about the possibility of having to participate, leading the chancellor to hold a series of telephone conversations with his counterparts ahead of Tuesday\u2019s meeting to emphasise his opposition.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Secretive calculations used by property developers to avoid paying for affordable housing are to be exposed in a bid to increase the supply of cheap homes. The opacity of developers\u2019 claims about how much profit they need to make if a scheme is to be viable, and therefore how much social housing they can afford to build, has been identified as a key reason for the fall in construction of affordable housing. In a response that will be closely observed by town halls across the country, the London borough of Islington is to change its planning system and insist the calculations are published in full. It will also stop developers paying incentives to consultants who draw up the viability assessments based on how much affordable housing they manage to avoid building. One housing expert, Dr Bob Colenutt, has claimed the current system constitutes \u201ca wholesale fraud on the public purse\u201d. \u201cIt has been very easy to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe developer undervalues the scheme using these viability assessments so they don\u2019t have to build the level of affordable housing in the planning policy.\u201d There have been several high-profile disputes over the amount of low-rent housing that private developers are willing to pay for. Last year, the Royal Mail Group produced a viability assessment saying only 24% of the homes on the planned redevelopment of the Mount Pleasant sorting office site in London could be affordable. Islington and neighbouring Camden council complained that 42% was possible and at a lower rent than proposed by the developer. But the London mayor, Boris Johnson, gave the go-ahead for 120 fewer affordable homes than the councils believed were possible. \u201cDevelopers and landowners have benefited at the expense of essential affordable housing thanks to a viability industry that has got out of control,\u201d said James Murray, executive member for housing at Islington, the Labour council that said it would resist developers\u2019 claims of commercial confidentiality about viability assessments. \u201cPeople are being conned out of affordable housing in some of the biggest developments in London. It has become such a murky process the pendulum has swung too far in favour of developers.\u201d One viability assessment was released last month following a freedom of information battle. It showed a developer considered 25% profit acceptable when the council scrutinising it said 15% was more normal. The difference on the scheme at the Elephant &amp; Castle in south London equated to \u00a3100m. Jerry Flynn, who obtained the figures, welcomed Islington\u2019s move. \u201cThe viability assessment is the most critical document now in the planning process and we are disabled if we can\u2019t see it and share it among people who understand them better than we do,\u201d said Flynn, a former resident of the Heygate estate at Elephant &amp; Castle, which has been knocked down to make way for a new development. Sadiq Khan, the MP for Tooting and a Labour candidate for London mayor, has said he would establish \u201ca London-wide standard, which demands that all viability assessments are transparent, honest, and fair\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong that complicated and secretive viability assessments are being used to protect landowners\u2019 and developers\u2019 profits, and prevent the building of affordable homes.\u201d Property experts have warned that council officers have often struggled to analyse the viability calculations presented to them. Islington is demanding \u201call viability evidence must be robustly justified and appraisal assumptions should be benchmarked against publicly available data sources\u201d and wants \u201csupporting evidence from applicants and lenders to justify proposed rates of profit\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel and her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, have come under sharp attack at home for their handling of the Greek crisis talks, with some opposition politicians accusing them of blackmailing Athens. Ahead of a special session of the Bundestag on Friday at which Merkel, the German chancellor, will ask parliamentarians to support negotiations for a third bailout for Greece, some MPs accused her and Sch\u00e4uble of deliberately trying to split Europe. Gerhard Schick, the financial expert of the Green party, accused the finance minister of acting \u201cextremely dangerously\u201d concerning his proposals for a temporary exit of Greece from the eurozone. \u201cWith his Grexit plan Sch\u00e4uble was calling for the division of Europe,\u201d he said. He called Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s plan \u201ca completely new negotiating position\u201d, which had been tabled without the approval of the rest of the German government. The deputy leader of the far-left Linke, Dietmar Bartsch, meanwhile accused the German government of extortion. \u201cThis negotiation result is a German diktat and nothing other than blackmail,\u201d he told German television. Sch\u00e4uble in particular had \u201csmashed an awful lot of porcelain\u201d during the talks, he added. With his Grexit paper he had \u201ctaken the axe to Europe. It is terrible what he did and the way he used it to threaten other countries,\u201d Bartsch said. Christian Lindner, the head of the liberal FDP party accused Merkel of adopting a \u201cnebulous\u201d negotiating strategy. He said her and Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s \u201cchange of direction\u201d was \u201cpolitically breathtaking and from a legal perspective extremely questionable\u201d. Opinion polls conducted shortly after the deal was struck on Monday morning, however, showed that the majority of German voters approved of the way in which the duo had managed the talks. According to a survey by ARD Deutschlandtrend, published on Monday evening, 64% of Germans applauded Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s behaviour, with 62% giving Merkel their backing. Germans have been horrified and puzzled by the huge backlash against Germany on social media and throughout the European and US press. \u201cOn the internet, Germany is the bogeyman,\u201d said Bild in an article that analysed the flood of negative publicity. It also voiced alarm that on top of the #ThisIsACoup hashtag on Twitter, there was a growing movement calling for the boycotting of German products, under #BoycottGermany and #StopBuyingGermany. While Merkel and Sch\u00e4uble might have popular support, only 18% of Germans said they trusted Greece to implement the reforms it signed up to, with 78% saying they had no trust in the government of Alexis Tsipras. The S\u00e4chische Zeitung in Dresden said that while it was to be welcomed that Greece would not be leaving the eurozone, there was no reason to consider the summit a success. \u201cWhether the eurozone and the EU can really end the crisis is nothing more than a vague hope. No one can guarantee that the investment programmes will have the desired effect on the Greek economy and the overdue modernisation of its clapped-out political system,\u201d it wrote in an editorial.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An interest rate hike in the UK is \u201cmoving closer\u201d, the governor of the Bank of England told MPs in comments that have fanned market expectations that policymakers could start to tighten borrowing costs before the end of the year. Speaking to the Treasury select committee on Tuesday, Mark Carney also expressed misgivings about the euro project, the sustainability of Greece\u2019s debts and the prospects for the embattled country\u2019s economy in the wake of this week\u2019s deal hammered out by leaders in the single currency union. His comments on interest rates had immediate impact on financial markets where investors are positioning themselves for the world\u2019s big central banks to start tightening policy after years of ultra-low borrowing costs ushered in by the financial crisis. With official figures earlier confirming inflation has slipped back to zero, well below the Bank\u2019s 2% target, most economists do not expect UK interest rates to start rising from their record low of 0.5% until 2016. But Carney told the parliamentary committee that households should start to manage their finances with a future hike in mind. The Bank governor noted the UK economy had been performing well, that wages were starting to pick up and that employment had seen a big increase, and he reiterated his view that people should prepare for a rise after more than six years of no change in rates. \u201cThe point at which interest rates may begin to rise is moving closer with the performance of the economy, consistent growth above trend, a firming in domestic costs, counterbalanced somewhat by disinflation imported from abroad,\u201d Carney told the Treasury committee. Going up? The pound strengthened and government bond yields rallied after his comments in a wide-ranging testimony that also covered George Osborne\u2019s budget last week. Carney repeated previous reassurances to households that when interest rates do start to rise, it will happen only gradually and that the Bank would watch the effect on people closely. \u201cOnce rates begin to adjust, we expect for those adjustments to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. We will learn about the sensitivity as rates begin to adjust, we will watch it very closely,\u201d he said. Carney and his fellow member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, David Miles, reiterated that rates would not return to levels seen previously. In the past he has said rates would peak well below the previous average of 4% to 5%. \u201cI do think there are a variety of factors that mean that the new normal, certainly over the policy horizon over the next three years, is substantially lower than it was previously,\u201d said Carney. \u201cI see no scenario in which they [rates] would move towards historic levels.\u201d Miles said that perhaps the \u201cnew normal is a little bit lower than Bank rate at 5%\u201d. Their fellow policymaker Ian McCafferty, who last year voted against the majority of the committee for rates to rise to 0.75%, repeated his concerns about wage growth having an impact on wider inflation in the economy. \u201cThe balance of risks that we face is shifting as we look over the course of the forecast. The near-term risks to inflation have therefore been on the downside because of that risk of persistent lower inflation because of behaviour change. As I look out towards the end of the forecast my perception of the risk starts to change towards the upside,\u201d McCafferty told MPs. It was the first session since the general election for the new-look Treasury select committee \u2013 one of the most influential in Westminster. The Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, returning as chairman of the committee, kicked off with a question about the prospects for Greece\u2019s recovery. Carney said the statement on Monday from eurozone leaders was an attempt to facilitate such a recovery but that it \u201crequires Herculean efforts from all sides, not just the Greeks in terms of structural reform\u201d. He also revealed serious misgivings about the euro project itself. \u201cThe process by which this agreement was struck, the nature of the agreement, the scale of the challenge, underscores the series of institutional shortcomings that still exist within European monetary union,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThere are big execution risks on all sides, including execution risk around the profile of the debt which in the judgment of the IMF and I believe other authorities, and we would share those judgments, is not sustainable in its current form.\u201d",

But Carney told the parliamentary committee that households should start to manage their finances with a future hike in mind.<br></p> <p>The Bank governor noted the UK economy had been performing well, that wages were starting to pick up and that employment had seen a big increase, and he reiterated his view that people should prepare for a rise after more than six years of no change in rates.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe point at which interest rates may begin to rise is moving closer with the performance of the economy, consistent growth above trend, a firming in domestic costs, counterbalanced somewhat by disinflation imported from abroad,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/661283da-7d27-43ed-8601-57efa76e5234\">Carney told the Treasury committee</a>.</p> <h2>Going up?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d27d18f72b128868e23106b21c3dd1fa556ce618\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436874288665/4f8c4342-481a-4c18-8e43-96418c468f62-460x276.png\" alt=\"Carney at Treasury Committee\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carney talks to MPs about the likely path for interest rates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: http://www.parliamentlive.tv/</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pound strengthened and government bond yields rallied after his comments in a wide-ranging testimony that also covered George Osborne\u2019s budget last week.</p> <p>Carney repeated previous reassurances to households that when interest rates do start to rise, it will happen only gradually and that the Bank would watch the effect on people closely. \u201cOnce rates begin to adjust, we expect for those adjustments to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent. We will learn about the sensitivity as rates begin to adjust, we will watch it very closely,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Carney and his fellow member of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee, David Miles, reiterated that rates would not return to levels seen previously. In the past he has said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/09/bank-of-england-interest-rates-rise-wages-mark-carney-tuc\">rates would peak well below the previous average of 4% to 5%</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI do think there are a variety of factors that mean that the new normal, certainly over the policy horizon over the next three years, is substantially lower than it was previously,\u201d said Carney. \u201cI see no scenario in which they [rates] would move towards historic levels.\u201d</p> <p>Miles said that perhaps the \u201cnew normal is a little bit lower than Bank rate at 5%\u201d.</p> <p>Their fellow policymaker Ian McCafferty, who last year voted against the majority of the committee for rates to rise to 0.75%, repeated his concerns about wage growth having an impact on wider inflation in the economy. </p> <p>\u201cThe balance of risks that we face is shifting as we look over the course of the forecast. The near-term risks to inflation have therefore been on the downside because of that risk of persistent lower inflation because of behaviour change. As I look out towards the end of the forecast my perception of the risk starts to change towards the upside,\u201d McCafferty told MPs.<br></p> <p>It was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/12/treasury-select-committee-question-carney-greek-crisis-interest-rates\">first session since the general election</a> for the new-look Treasury select committee \u2013 one of the most influential in Westminster. The Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, returning as chairman of the committee, kicked off with a question about the prospects for Greece\u2019s recovery.</p> <p>Carney said the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/13/greece-bailout-agreement-key-points-grexit\">statement on Monday from eurozone leaders </a>was an attempt to facilitate such a recovery but that it \u201crequires Herculean efforts from all sides, not just the Greeks in terms of structural reform\u201d.</p> <p>He also revealed serious misgivings about the euro project itself. \u201cThe process by which this agreement was struck, the nature of the agreement, the scale of the challenge, underscores the series of institutional shortcomings that still exist within European monetary union,\u201d Carney said.</p> <p>\u201cThere are big execution risks on all sides, including execution risk around the profile of the debt which in the judgment of the IMF and I believe other authorities, and we would share those judgments, is not sustainable in its current form.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A beleaguered Alexis Tsipras was locked in talks on Tuesday with his own MPs amid speculation that the Greek prime minister could be forced to form a national unity government to push through the draconian bailout deal imposed by Brussels on debt-stricken Greece. Facing a rebellion over the terms of a fresh \u20ac86bn (\u00a361bn) rescue package, Tsipras has considered sidelining the increasingly belligerent leftwing faction in Syriza in favour of a broader coalition to push through spending cuts and painful reforms. In Brussels, meanwhile, EU finance ministers met to discuss how a fresh bundle of loans can be pieced together to bridge Greece\u2019s current funding gap. Athens faces demands to repay \u20ac7bn of debts in July, including \u20ac3.5bn due to the European Central Bank on 20 July. This will require a bridging loan of \u20ac10bn-\u20ac12bn, as the full bailout will not be agreed in time. All of the other 27 EU nations are expected to be asked to contribute. The UK chancellor, George Osborne, said Britain will not contribute any money to the Greek bailout, telling reporters: Britain is not in the euro, so the idea that British taxpayers will be on the line for this Greek deal is a complete non-starter. The eurozone needs to foot its own bill. Britain has contributed around \u00a31bn to the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), but the funds have remained outside a scheme used to underwrite short-term loans to Greece following a deal between the UK and Brussels in 2010 stipulating that UK funds would only be used to protect the EU. In Athens, one of the scenarios being considered is the formation of a cross-party government to not only push reforms through parliament but also play a role implementing them against what is likely to be stiff opposition. The radical-left party is increasingly fighting a battle for survival in government with cadres saying Syriza\u2019s overall aim is not to go down as a \u201cleft parenthesis\u201d in power. \u201cEverything will be judged with the enforcement of real government policy which will not only be the agreement,\u201d the interior minister, Nikos Voutsis, said on Tuesday morning. Calling the proposed deal \u201cvery difficult, very bad\u201d, the minister said the real issue the government faced would be finding and enacting policies that could have an ameliorating affect on the painful consequences that the measures were likely to have socially. \u201cSocial counter-measures must be found which will give hope to people.\u201d Tsipras is seeking agreement among the 149 Syriza MPs who dominate the 300-strong parliament, but could splinter in response to a vote on the deal. Greece has promised to pass into law by Wednesday a string of reforms as the price of a deal that include reforming the VAT system, overhauling pensions and signing up to plans that ensure immediate spending cuts in the event of breaching creditor-mandated budget targets. Athens has agreed to sell off state assets worth \u20ac50bn, with the proceeds earmarked for a trust fund supervised by its creditors. Half the fund will be used to recapitalise Greek banks, while the remaining \u20ac25bn will pay down Greek debts as well as be investmented. Determined to keep his party together ahead of an expected onslaught by MPs opposing the outlined deal, Tsipras summoned his closest allies to a meeting in Athens before a gathering of his parliamentary party on Tuesday. Tsipras won backing from his coalition partner the Independent Greeks, after its leader Panos Kammenos initially criticised the deal and especially the \u00a350bn of privatisations demanded by Brussels, which must be channelled into a separate fund. Kammenos said: \u201cWe will stand by the Alexis Tsipras government.\u201d Many of Kammenos\u2019s MPs have said the new agreement, as outlined in the marathon overnight meeting in Brussels, is much harsher than the original one the coalition had endorsed last weekend and, as such, is unacceptable. But Kammenos is still backing the PM, telling reporters that: \u201cIt is clear to all of Europe that [on Monday] a coup happened in the heart of Europe. The PM was blackmailed into signing a very different agreement. And this coup is continuing here in Greece where people want the government to fall.\u201d The former Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has called the deal \u201cunviable\u201d and likened it to the 1919 Treaty of Versailles \u2013 widely seen as the harbinger of the second world war for its crushing of Weimar Germany. \u201cThis has nothing to do with economics. It has nothing to do with putting Greece back on the rails towards recovery,\u201d Varoufakis told Australia\u2019s public broadcaster, the ABC. \u201cThis is a new Versailles treaty that is haunting Europe again, and the prime minister [Alexis Tsipras] knows it. He knows he\u2019s damned if he does and he\u2019s damned if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Emphasing the scale of the task ahead, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, told the Treasury committee in Westminster, that success will require \u201cHerculean efforts\u201d from all sides. He said the scale of structural reforms, fiscal adjustment, privatisations required will be significant with \u201cbig execution risks\u201d. The central bank chief also put his weight behind arguments put forward by the International Monetary Fund that Greece needs its \u20ac340bn debt burden with public and private lenders to be cut if it is to emerge from under its debt mountain. He warned that Greece\u2019s debts \u201care not sustainable in their current form\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Austerity measures demanded of Greece by its European creditors will strengthen the far right, the country\u2019s former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has said. Varoufakis also dubbed the bailout agreement reached in Brussels this week as a new Treaty of Versaille, and a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat which used banks instead of tanks. The Greek government has found itself in a dire political situation after it was forced to accept draconian austerity measures as part of a bailout offer even harsher than the one a national referendum voted no to last week. The outspoken former minister, who resigned from his role after the national referendum, despite it returning the result he was calling for, told the ABC the far-right Golden Dawn party could \u201cinherit the mantle of the anti-austerity drive, tragically\u201d. \u201cIf our party Syriza, that has cultivated so much hope in Greece \u2013 to the extent that we managed to score 61.5% in the recent referendum \u2013 if we betray this hope and if we bow our heads to this new form of postmodern occupation, then I cannot see any other possible outcome than the further strengthening of Golden Dawn,\u201d Varoufakis said. Speaking to Radio National\u2019s Phillip Adams in his first post-resignation interview, Varoufakis also said he \u201cjumped more than he was pushed\u201d when he resigned from the ministry. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras \u201cdidn\u2019t have what it took, sentimentally, emotionally, at that moment, to carry that no vote to Europe and use it as a weapon,\u201d said Varoufakis. \u201cSo I \u2026 decided to give him the leeway that he needs to go back to Brussels and strike what he knows to be an impossible deal. A deal that is simply not viable.\u201d Varoufakis said he stood back to allow his successor, Euclid Tsakolotos, and the Greek negotiating team work in Brussels. \u201cI know very well what it feels like to walk inside those neon-lit, heartless rooms, full of apparatchiks and bureaucrats who have absolutely no interest in the human cost of decision-making, and to have to struggle against them and come up with something palatable.\u201d Greece was \u201cset up\u201d by eurozone leaders in dealings to address the economic crisis, Varoufakis later told the New Statesman, adding Germany was responsible for the view of the Eurogroup. \u201cOh completely and utterly,\u201d he said. \u201cNot attitudes \u2013 the finance minister of Germany. It is all like a very well-tuned orchestra and he is the director.\u201d Varoufakis has previously accused the EU of putting a bailout of French and German banks ahead of Greece\u2019s socioeconomic viability. After 15 hours of talks that stretched through Sunday night and into Monday, Greece walked away from the emergency summit of Eurozone leaders with a \u201ccompromise\u201d bailout package. Growing anger at the creditors\u2019 wishlist played out on social media under the hashtag #thisisacoup, as the drastic demands made were presented as the price to pay if Greece was to stay in the European union. The referendum result, and the government\u2019s about-turn, has shocked Greeks who had overwhelmingly rejected the previous offer. Varoufakis said he had not expected a no vote, and suggested neither had Tsipras. \u201cI had assumed, and I believe so had the prime minister, that our support and the no vote would fade exponentially, but the Greek people overcame fear, they set aside their pecuniary interests, they ignored the fact their savings could not be accessed, and they gave a resounding, majestic no to what was in the end an awful ultimatum on behalf of our European partners,\u201d Varoufakis said. Tsipras must now take the measures, which include VAT reform, spending cuts, a pensions overhaul and \u20ac50bn in privatisation, to a hostile Greek parliament. \u201cThis is indeed the politics of humiliation,\u201d said Varoufakis.",

      "bodyText": "Summer clothing sales are expected to have pulled UK inflation back down to zero last month, bringing more relief to households and taking pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates any time soon. Economists expect official figures published on Tuesday morning to show inflation on the consumer price index (CPI) measure dipping back to zero in June, from 0.1% in May. Some economists in a Reuters poll forecast prices could even be down on a year earlier, especially if there was widespread and early summer discounting on the high street. The lowest forecast in the poll is for prices to be down 0.2% on a year earlier. That would mark a return to the negative inflation in April, the first instance in more than half a century. Bank policymakers have appeared relaxed about inflation being well below their 2% target. The dip into negative inflation had been widely predicted, including by the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, after a sharp drop in oil prices since last summer. He recently told Britons to enjoy the period of low prices while it lasts. Economists agree that inflation is likely to rebound but say in the meantime the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) can afford to take its time deciding when to start raising borrowing costs from 0.5%, where they have been for more than six years. Markets are not pricing in a rise until well into 2016. \u201cInflation in June will have stayed close to zero \u2013 indeed, the UK may even have fallen back into deflation. There are still no signs that low inflation will become permanently embedded. Nonetheless, the benign outlook leaves the MPC plenty of room to leave interest rates on hold for a while longer,\u201d said Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at the thinktank Capital Economics. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, is predicting inflation of 0.1% in June. \u201cSome firming in food prices and overall less discounting by retailers than a year ago may well have prevented the UK from suffering a renewed dip into deflation in June, although a renewed softening in oil prices may have exerted some downward pressure on inflation,\u201d he said. While inflation is well off the government-set target and has been characterised by some government critics as a sign of economic fragility, for households it means they are better off in real terms. Official figures on Wednesday are expected to show wages rising 3.3% during the three months to May after growth of 2.7% in the three months to April. That would be the fastest pace for five years and bring relief after years of average pay falling in real terms because it lagged inflation. \u201cWith CPI inflation still hugging zero, real wage inflation of 3% year on year is very robust and great news for consumer spending growth,\u201d said Alan Clarke, a fixed income strategist at Scotiabank.",

Nonetheless, the benign outlook leaves the MPC plenty of room to leave interest rates on hold for a while longer,\u201d said Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at the thinktank Capital Economics.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, is predicting inflation of 0.1% in June.</p> <p>\u201cSome firming in food prices and overall less discounting by retailers than a year ago may well have prevented the UK from suffering a renewed dip into deflation in June, although a renewed softening in oil prices may have exerted some downward pressure on inflation,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>While inflation is well off the government-set target and has been characterised by some government critics as a sign of economic fragility, for households it means they are better off in real terms.<br></p> <p>Official figures on Wednesday are expected to show wages rising 3.3% during the three months to May after growth of 2.7% in the three months to April. That would be the fastest pace for five years and bring relief after years of average pay falling in real terms because it lagged inflation.<br></p> <p>\u201cWith CPI inflation still hugging zero, real wage inflation of 3% year on year is very robust and great news for consumer spending growth,\u201d said Alan Clarke, a fixed income strategist at Scotiabank<strong>.</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Australian business confidence has jumped to its highest level in almost two years as the service sector starts to take up the slack from mining. The closely watched National Australia Bank confidence barometer rose two points in June to 10 index points \u2013 the strongest reading since September 2013. It comes after confidence bounced four points to a nine-month high in May. NAB economist James Glenn said the booming housing market had given a boost to professional services and that the strongest job growth was coming from areas such as health and hospitality. \u201cWhen you look at the level of confidence and especially conditions by industry, we see that it is areas like finance, property and business services as well as recreational and personal services that have generally outperformed for some time now,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect that these industries have been best positioned to benefit from the lower interest rates and the lower dollar, as well as more fundamental structural shifts.\u201d \u201cConfidence is now positive in all industries except mining, which is currently zero,\u201d he said on Tuesday. Business conditions also improved in June, the NAB survey showed, lifting five points to its highest level since last October at 11 index points. \u201cImprovements in both confidence and conditions over recent months are starting to suggest a more convincing turnaround in the non-mining sectors is under way,\u201d Glenn added. Low interest rates continued to support the housing sector, the report said, and housing credit growth, while business credit had also been gaining momentum. But Glenn said the bank\u2019s forecasts for economic growth remained unchanged. Domestic demand was still weak, as evidenced by still-cautious retail spending, and although unemployment was expected to peak lower than previously expected (at about 6.25%, it will remain high). There would be no more rate cuts by the Reserve Bank, Glenn concluded, despite the downside risk presented by the recent uncertainty caused by the euro crisis and the sell-off in the Chinese stock markets. \u201cThe big picture is still one where the domestic economy is struggling to offset the impact of sharply lower mining investment,\u201d Glenn said. But lower interest rates and a sagging Aussie dollar, paired with the housing boom and a post-budget kick in confidence, appeared to have boosted business outcomes, he said. Meanwhile, the Australian share market responded positively to the tentative deal for a Greek bailout. The ASX200 was up 1.7% to 5,567 at lunchtime on Tuesday.",
