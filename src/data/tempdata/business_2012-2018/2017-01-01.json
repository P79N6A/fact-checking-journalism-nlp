      "bodyText": "The latest battleground for the future of fracking in Britain looks set to be Sherwood Forest, the legendary home of folk hero Robin Hood and now the target of a seismic survey by Ineos. The chemical multinational, which relocated its headquarters back to the UK last month, appears to have agreed terms with the Forestry commission to start burying charges and spend up to two years using \u201cthumper trucks\u201d or vibroseis machines to search for shale gas. Campaigners have called on the government to block any possible fracking and protect the forest. According to documents obtained under freedom of information request by Friends of the Earth, Ineos could be working within 200 metres of the Major Oak, a 1,000-year old tree that in folklore sheltered Robin Hood and his merry men. Commercial fracking has yet to start in Britain, although Ineos and other firms have obtained licences from the government for shale gas exploration. The technology has been deeply controversial since tests conducted by Cuadrilla in 2011 caused earth tremors near Blackpool, but fracking operations are expected to restart in five wells in Yorkshire and Lancashire later this year. A small protest camp has been established at Kirby Misperton, North Yorkshire, at one of the wells where gas firm Third Energy has been given permission to start fracking. Guy Shrubsole, a Friends of the Earth campaigner, said he expected the move to search for shale gas under Sherwood Forest to become a new rallying point. He said: \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything more iconic in the English mindset to go for. You\u2019d have thought they\u2019d have learnt from the mistakes of some of the other fracking companies to avoid it, but they\u2019ve gone straight for it.\u201d Ineos told the Daily Telegraph that no decision had been made on whether fracking would go ahead under the national nature reserve, adding that \u201cany decision to position a well site will take into account environmental features such as the Major Oak\u201d. The firm\u2019s shale operations director, Tom Pickering, said: \u201cPotentially we in the UK have a huge supply of indigenous gas under our own feet. It would be simply crazy not to explore this natural resource.\u201d However, Friends of the Earth fear that the seismic surveys alone could damage the forest, whose core is a site of special scientific interest, and its wildlife, which include rare bats and other protected species as well as ancient woodland. The Forestry commission has mandated that Ineos plants its charges at least 50 metres away from badgers\u2019 setts and conservation sites. Ineos is a relatively new player in fracking, but was one of the big winners in the governmental handout of exploration licences, winning 21 of 159 awarded a year ago. The firm, founded by Jim Ratcliffe and with 17,000 employees worldwide, was welcomed back to the UK by the government last month as a \u201cvote of confidence in the UK economy\u201d, as it promised a $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) investment in businesses including shale gas. Other moves by Ineos to conduct fracking surveys in Nottinghamshire have been rebuffed. The National Trust refused the firm permission to conduct surveys in Clumber Park, a few miles to the north of the forest.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Gambling firms staged a charm offensive during 2016, spending more money on adverts and stepping up the hospitality they offer MPs, who are considering a regulatory crackdown. The industry has come under the spotlight amid concern about its commitment to curbing problem gambling and fears about the influence that daytime TV adverts have on children. The increased scrutiny culminated in a government review of betting firms\u2019 social responsibility, including controversial fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), often dubbed the \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d of gambling for their addictive nature. The parliamentary register of members\u2019 interests, which details the value of gifts and donations received by politicians, reveals that major bookmakers and horse racing firms quadrupled their efforts to entertain MPs ahead of the review. Politicians enjoyed the largesse of the gambling world on 33 separate occasions last year, accepting tickets worth thousands of pounds to racing and football events.They accepted nearly \u00a320,000 of hospitality, including tickets to Ascot, the Derby and the Grand National. The two biggest beneficiaries were Conservative MPs Laurence Robertson, and Philip Davies, who was referred to the MPs\u2019 ethics watchdog in 2013 over his links to the gambling industry. Davies accepted \u00a34,720 of hospitality from the gambling industry in 2016, while Robertson enjoyed entertainment worth \u00a35,166. On their basic salary of \u00a374,962, it would take an MP nearly a month to earn enough to pay for \u00a35,166 of hospitality out of their own pocket. Other notable recipients include former SNP leader Alec Salmond \u2013 who was given a badge worth up to \u00a31,000 by the Racecourse Association permitting entry to certain racecourses \u2013 and secretary of state for international development Priti Patel. She was given two Grand National tickets worth \u00a32,000 by Jockey Club Racecourses. The amount spent on MPs \u2013 during a year in which the threat of increased regulation has loomed large \u2013 was a major increase on 2015, when gambling and racing firms hosted MPs just nine times, to a total value of less than \u00a35,000. A spokesman for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, which campaigns for FOBT maximum stakes to be reduced from \u00a3100 to \u00a32, said: \u201cThose MP\u2019s who accept the bookies\u2019 free entertainment must surely realise what this is really about and why all of a sudden they are splashing the cash on them. \u201cThey are trying to garner what support they can for their \u00a3100-a-spin machines and stave off what looks like an impending clampdown by the government. \u201cOur campaign looks forward to finding out where the 33 MPs who have accepted hospitality stand on the issue of the bookies\u2019 addictive machines.\u201d Last month Carolyn Harris, Labour MP for Swansea East, called for the maximum stake on FOBTs to be reduced in her capacity as chair of the all-party parliamentary group on FOBTs. She said: \u201cInterestingly I\u2019ve never been offered any hospitality, not that I would expect to be.\u201d There is no suggestion that any of the named MPs have been unduly influenced in their decision making by gifts received. The UK\u2019s booming gambling sector also continued to ramp up its spending on TV adverts. Excluding lotteries, gambling firms had spent \u00a394.4m on TV adverts by the end of October, according to data analysis firm Nielsen, putting them on course to beat the\u00a3118.8m spent in 2015. Including lotteries and spending in the print media and billboards, betting firms had spent \u00a3211m by October, with figures for the full year not due to be released until February. The amount of gambling advertising on TV has triggered concerns among politicians and campaigners about the potential impact on children of daytime adverts for gambling, which are permitted alongside sporting events. The gambling industry also ramped up its lobbying efforts with the Back Your Local Bookie campaign, launched by the Association of British Bookmakers (ABB). The ABB tweeted about the campaign in mid-October, which coincided with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport launching its call for evidence on gaming machines and social responsibility. The campaign website includes an automated form that allows people to put their name to a letter to their local MP, worded by the ABB. It reads: \u201cI\u2019m tired of how bookmakers are constantly misrepresented, and I\u2019m concerned about the impact of any further regulation on bookies. \u201cBetting shops are closing at a rate of over 100 per year and with that local authorities are losing yet another business rate paying retailer from their high streets. And without bookies, our high streets will continue to suffer a decline in footfall. \u201cThe potential for further regulation will only hasten these closures. My local bookie is a sociable, fun meeting place, with great staff, and I want it to stay that way.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China\u2019s manufacturing sector expanded for a fifth month in December but growth was slightly less than expected, with government measures to curb soaring asset prices beginning to have an effect on the broader economy. The official purchasing managers\u2019 index slipped from 51.7 in November to 51.4 last month, compared to forecasts in a Reuters poll of a figure of 51.5. A reading above 50 indicates that the economy is growing. A year ago the index was at 49.7, and the start of 2016 saw global markets spooked by worries of a severe slowdown in the world\u2019s second largest economy, but since then it has been slowly recovering. A housing boom in the second half of 2016 and a government spending spree on infrastructure have helped boost prices for commodities, from cement to steel, giving the country\u2019s manufacturing sector a much-needed lift. But the government is cracking down on speculative property buying, and signals from policymakers that more will be done to contain asset bubbles and rising debt \u2013 even at the expense of slower growth \u2013 suggest extra stimulus measures could be limited. \u201c[These] PMI figures suggest that the change of policy tone has taken its toll, as the authorities are seriously concerned about the asset bubbles,\u201d said Zhou Hao, senior economist at Commerzbank. Factory output slowed in December, with the sub-index hitting 53.3 compared with 53.9 the previous month. Total new orders were flat at 53.2, logging the same as in November, while new export orders fell to 50.1 from 50.3. Jobs were again lost, with the employment sub-index sitting at 48.9, compared to 49.2 in November, as the country pledged to cut excess capacity over a range of industries. The Markit/Caixin PMI, a private gauge of manufacturing activity which focuses more on small- and mid-sized firms, is due on 3 January. A separate reading on the services sector showed the pace of growth slowed in December. The official non-manufacturing PMI stood at 54.5 in December, down from 54.7 in November, but still well above the 50-point mark.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco has reduced the price of women\u2019s standard razors to match that of men\u2019s in the latest victory in the battle to eliminate gender discrimination in high street products. A newspaper investigation at the start of last year showed that women were paying an average of 37% more for gender-targeted items, ranging from toys to beauty products. Razors were found to be among the more marked-up products, with women often paying a premium just because the product was a different colour \u2013 pink. Tesco was charging \u00a31 for a pack of five women\u2019s twin-blade razors, twice the price of the men\u2019s equivalent. The Labour backbencher Paula Sherriff, who recently persuaded Boots to trial donation boxes where customers could leave sanitary products for distribution to food banks, put pressure on Tesco to reduce women\u2019s disposable razor prices. In a letter to Sherriff, which has been passed to the Guardian, Tesco\u2019s commercial director for packaged products, Kari Daniels, said the supermarket had reviewed its products to make sure it was not guilty of gender-differentiated pricing following a parliamentary debate. Daniels said the disparity in price was not the result of gender bias, but added: \u201cIn the instance of our twin-blade razors, the difference is driven by the fact that male razors are produced and sold in significantly higher volumes, which reduces the price we pay for them. \u201cHowever, following an internal review and discussions with our suppliers, we have acted on concerns about the difference in price of our female and male disposable twin-blade razors, in line with our commitment to ensure consistently low, simple and affordable pricing. \u201cWe have aligned the prices of these products so that the male and female razors are the same price per unit. We have done this by reducing the cost of the women\u2019s razors and keeping the cost of the men\u2019s razors the same.\u201d Both sets of razors now cost 10p per unit. Daniels also insisted that Tesco had changed its pricing strategy so it was \u201cmoving away from large, short-term promotions to focus on prices that are consistently low and affordable, and simpler to understand\u201d. Sherriff\u2019s most significant parliamentary triumph since entering the House of Commons last year was forcing the government to confront the EU over the 5% VAT it makes countries impose on sanitary products. Ministers climbed down over the issue after Sherriff secured significant Eurosceptic Conservative support to demand that VAT be scrapped as part of any EU membership renegotiation package before the referendum on 23 June 2016. The former NHS worker, who also convinced WH Smith to reduce the cost of products in hospital shops to be in line with its high street prices, said: \u201cThis is a welcome step from Tesco, and I hope other companies will identify and correct similar disparities. \u201cThe government has refused to act on gender pricing so we have had to take a lead. I\u2019d encourage anyone who sees examples to get in touch and I\u2019ll take it up.\u201d Although gender-based pricing became a major issue in 2016, there had been concerns about the practice for several years. A 2012 study by Development Economics for insurer Aviva found that women were paying \u00a3200 extra a year for what were basically the same consumer goods and services.",

      "bodyText": "The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, spent years in his previous role as Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister secretly blocking EU efforts to tackle tax avoidance by multinational corporations, leaked documents reveal. Years\u2019 worth of confidential German diplomatic cables provide a candid account of Luxembourg\u2019s obstructive manoeuvres inside one of Brussels\u2019 most secretive committees. The code of conduct group on business taxation was set up almost 19 years ago to prevent member states from being played off against one another by increasingly powerful multinational businesses, eager to shift profits across borders and avoid tax. Little has been known until now about the workings of the committee, which has been meeting since 1998, after member states agreed a code of conduct on tax policies and pledged not to engage in \u201charmful competition\u201d with one another. However, the leaked cables reveal how a small handful of countries have used their seats on the committee to frustrate concerted EU action and protect their own tax regimes. Efforts by a majority of member states to curb aggressive tax planning and to rein in predatory tax policies were regularly delayed, diluted or derailed by the actions of a few of the EU\u2019s smallest members, frequently led by Luxembourg. The leaked papers, shared with the Guardian and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists by the German radio group NDR, are highly embarrassing for Juncker, who served as Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister from 1995 until the end of 2013. During that period he also acted as finance and treasury minister, taking a close interest in tax policy. Despite having a population of just 560,000, Luxembourg was able to resist widely supported EU tax reforms, its dissenting voice often backed only by that of the Netherlands. Among proposals popular in the code of conduct committee but opposed by Luxembourg were: \u2022 Plans for tax authorities in each member state to subject their dealings with multinational businesses to peer review. \u2022 An investigation into cross-border tax avoidance strategies, known as \u201chybrid mismatches\u201d, often used by multinationals to conjure up artificial tax savings. \u2022 Improved information sharing between member states on tax deals granted to multinationals in private. A spokesperson for Luxembourg\u2019s finance ministry refused to comment on the positions previous governments had taken in private EU discussions. \u201cWe have no knowledge of the communications you claim to have, and whether they are genuine, and therefore cannot comment on them,\u201d he said. The spokesperson added: \u201cIn recent years Luxembourg has been at the forefront of the global trend towards greater transparency in tax matters and the fight against harmful tax competition.\u201d The Guardian spoke to another former member of the code of conduct committee, who did not want to be named but corroborated claims in the leaked cables that Luxembourg was regularly among those looking to frustrate EU efforts to tackle tax avoidance. The source said the committee was no longer fit for purpose. They said it was unable to achieve much because it was governed by unanimity. \u201cEach country is ready to block any agreement. Moreover, each country stands ready to bargain its position on tax against any other topic at stake in the EU,\u201d they said. Some tax experts contacted by the Guardian confirmed that Luxembourg had begun to move away from certain aggressive tax policies under the current prime minister, Xavier Bettel. However, the leaked cables suggest the country has remained resistant to other changes. In 2016 it fiercely opposed efforts supported by many countries to strengthen and expand the code of conduct committee\u2019s work. Luxembourg particularly objected to a relaxation of the committee\u2019s own rules on decision making, insisting there was no need to abandon the unanimity requirement. France, Germany and Sweden argued unsuccessfully that removing unanimity had become essential to the committee\u2019s effectiveness. Luxembourg also opposed plans to identify member states that were standing in the way of reforms more clearly. One leaked cable noted: \u201cIt has become abundantly clear once again that a majority [of members states] are not interested in real reform. In particular, Luxembourg representatives said they would fundamentally object to any proposal to publish arguments made by Luxembourg in the committee.\u201d A later cable read: \u201cIt is impressive to see how some member states present themselves outwardly as proponents of [international tax reforms] and at the same time to watch how they actually behave in EU discussions, protected by confidentiality.\u201d The Guardian contacted Juncker\u2019s office for comment. A spokesperson said it was not for the European commission to respond to questions about negotiating positions Luxembourg had taken, or about the country\u2019s past tax policies. Damaging revelations Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s record as Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister has cast an enduring shadow over his presidency of the European commission. On paper, his marathon 18-year stint at the helm of the EU\u2019s second smallest member state might be hailed a triumph. He recast the fading steel-based economy into a booming hub for international business, and when he departed in 2013 Luxembourg had been transformed into one of the richest countries in the world per capita. Hundreds of the multinational corporations rushed to channel international profits through subsidiaries in the country, among them McDonald\u2019s, Fiat, Amazon, Shire Pharmaceuticals and Skype. The secret to this success was exposed in 2014 when the Luxleaks scandal revealed the terms hidden within hundreds of private deals, known as \u201ctax rulings\u201d, that Luxembourg had handed out to multinational businesses behind closed doors. The rulings effectively rubber-stamped complex tax structures that global corporations used to access ultra-low tax rates, often less than 1%, for profits shifted to Luxembourg. Juncker conceded the scandal had damaged his reputation. While not illegal, he admitted Luxembourg\u2019s tax system was also \u201cnot always in line with fiscal fairness\u201d and may have breached \u201cethical and moral standards\u201d. Since then, Juncker has made a point of supporting the EU\u2019s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, as she pursues high-profile investigations into specific tax rulings, including deals Luxembourg granted separately to McDonald\u2019s and Amazon. The investigations are examining whether the deals were so generous that they amounted to illegal state aid from Juncker\u2019s Luxembourg. Juncker has also campaigned hard for greater tax cooperation among member states in the battle against international businesses that avoid tax. The latest leaked cables, however, raise further questions about whether he is the right person to champion such reforms.",

In particular, Luxembourg representatives said they would fundamentally object to any proposal to publish arguments made by Luxembourg in the committee.\u201d</p> <p>A later cable read: \u201cIt is impressive to see how some member states present themselves outwardly as proponents of [international tax reforms] and at the same time to watch how they actually behave in EU discussions, protected by confidentiality.\u201d </p> <p>The Guardian contacted Juncker\u2019s office for comment. A spokesperson said it was not for the European commission to respond to questions about negotiating positions Luxembourg had taken, or about the country\u2019s past tax policies.</p> <h2>Damaging revelations</h2> <p>Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s record as Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister has cast an enduring shadow over his presidency of the European commission.</p> <p>On paper, his marathon 18-year stint at the helm of the EU\u2019s second smallest member state might be hailed a triumph.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "New Year: a time for resolutions, detox diets and predictions. But after the year forecasters had in 2016, who would be brazen enough to predict how 2017 will pan out? Where most economists went wrong last year \u2013 including the likes of the Bank of England and International Monetary Fund \u2013 was in predicting a sharp slowdown in the event of a vote for Brexit. George Osborne, for example, made the misjudged warning that a vote to leave the EU was a vote for recession. The early data could be revised, but it suggests that far from grinding to a halt, the economy continued to grow in the months following the referendum. Consumers kept spending, house prices rose and businesses continued to win new contracts at home and abroad. There are plenty of signs the economic pain has been delayed rather than averted. Inflation is picking up as a weak pound raises import costs. Cracks are showing in the jobs market and wages will soon struggle to keep pace with inflation. Business and consumer confidence have waned. And Brexit negotiations haven\u2019t even begun. There are other threats beyond Brexit. Elections in the eurozone may bring turmoil to the bloc if support rises for anti-establishment nationalists. In the US, Donald Trump moves into the White House in less than three weeks and there is a risk he may start a trade war with China that could have global consequences. Yet there are still reasons to hope that 2017, like 2016, will not turn out as bad as the doomsayers predict. Surely, one lesson from last year is that when forecasters accentuate the negative they risk missing the positives altogether. So to start the new year on an upbeat note, here are a few reasons to be cheerful in 2017. The economy will keep growing The UK economy remains unbalanced, with an over-reliance on consumer spending, but it chalked up respectable growth in 2016. Expansion will most likely slow in 2017, but the UK should avoid recession. The services sector\u2019s fortunes will depend largely on how hard inflation hits consumer spending. Manufacturing and construction face a tough year as uncertainty and higher costs bite. But tourism and exports should be helped by a weak pound and there has been no exodus of foreign firms from Britain yet. Productivity is back in the spotlight After years of the UK lagging other big economies on productivity, ministers have vowed to sort out economic efficiency and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced a \u00a323bn productivity fund in his autumn statement. It will not go very far but it is a start. The government push could be complemented by the private sector if the adversity and higher costs sparked by the Brexit vote force firms to improve their productivity. With a slowdown in immigration and a rise in the minimum wage coming, employers will need to look beyond cheap labour to maintain their profit margins. Ideally, that means investing more in good management, training and technology. Wages for the lowest paid will rise Inflation will squeeze average take-home pay in 2017, but for the lowest paid there is some good news as the \u201cnational living wage\u201d \u2013 the minimum wage for over-25s \u2013 will rise in April from \u00a37.20 to \u00a37.50 an hour. That is still below what anti-poverty campaigners say should be the real living wage needed to meet everyday costs. The voluntary living wage is \u00a39.75 in London and \u00a38.45 elsewhere as set by the Living Wage Foundation. It reckons a fifth of UK workers are still not paid enough. But the good news is 3,000 employers have joined the voluntary scheme, including almost a third of the FTSE 100. Gender pay gap rules come into force There is still a 9.4% gap in average pay between male and female full-time employees. But companies will come under pressure to address the discrepancies when new rules come into force in April requiring large employers to report their gender pay and gender bonus gaps. More funding for apprenticeships Another change for employers this year is the apprenticeship levy, a tax on businesses designed to fund more work-based training schemes. It is high time young people in the UK are given more routes into decent careers and expanding apprenticeships could help tackle skills shortages in sectors such as construction. But employer groups have voiced legitimate concerns that the government risks going after quantity and not quality with its target of 3m apprenticeships by 2020. There are warnings the levy may prompt unscrupulous employers to rebadge existing jobs as apprenticeships to meet training targets and recoup the costs of the charge. Faint hopes for first-time buyers There was no house price crash after the referendum, but growth eased, dampened by Brexit-related uncertainty and stamp duty changes. The market is expected to slow further in 2017 and some forecasters predict prices could fall. That outlook will bring homeowners out in cold sweats but for anyone who has been trying to get on the housing ladder, a moderation in prices is long overdue. There is also a slither of hope that a government drive to address the UK\u2019s housing shortage could help first-time buyers. Still, given past experience of unfulfilled housebuilding promises, they should not hold their breath, and the uncertain economic outlook may make builders nervous about taking on big projects. The weak pound will help exporters There is little sign of it yet, but in theory the weak pound should help UK exports by making them cheaper in overseas markets. If the government wants UK businesses to capitalise on the drop in sterling it will need to give them more support to crack new markets such as one-to-one mentoring and funding to attend trade fairs. Interest rates will stay low The Bank of England faces a trade-off between supporting growth and jobs on the one hand and keeping inflation in check on the other. The Bank has said there are limits to how far it will tolerate rising inflation but most of the signals suggest that under Mark Carney it is more worried about jobs. So it is bad news if you are saver, but for businesses and mortgage holders, 2017 will see continued support from rates staying at, or close to, their all-time low of 0.25%. Calls for government help will grow louder The Bank stepped in with a package of post-referendum support for the economy, but the government has been more hands off. Carney and other central bankers around the world have repeatedly urged politicians to do their share of the heavy lifting to bolster their economies with spending on infrastructure and structural reforms. If Hammond\u2019s maiden autumn statement was anything to go by, he is not ready to pick up the baton. Far from abandoning Osborne\u2019s austerity drive, the new chancellor merely pared it back and he remains fixated on cutting the deficit. Yet, there are growing signs that voters here and abroad are fed up with the status quo and as inflation starts to erode UK living standards, Theresa May\u2019s government will come under more pressure to deliver her promise of an economy \u201cthat works for everyone\u201d. She and her cabinet will ignore people\u2019s frustrations at their peril.",

      "bodyText": "When you start the year as a FTSE 100 company, but end it in second place on the list of the \u201cmodern Christmas cracker jokes\u201d (according to UKTV\u2019s comedy channel Gold) you can assume it\u2019s been a challenging year. The company in question is, of course, Sports Direct, which spent 2016 engulfed by a crisis over pay and working conditions at its depot in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, where it was revealed that workers were effectively receiving less than the national minimum wage after unpaid body searches and tough financial penalties for slight lateness. Hence the chart-topping gag: what do workers at Sports Direct get for Christmas dinner? Answer: about five minutes. But was that really the funniest Sports Direct crack of the year? Maybe not. There was the one where founder Mike Ashley went through a mock security check as part of a PR campaign to demonstrate he really was a man of the people, only to then pull a wad of \u00a350 notes out of his pocket; a similar joke about the company buying a private jet, but allowing staff to rent it for a commercial rate; plus another one when MPs visited Shirebrook only to discover they were being secretly recorded. Still, the most hilarious joke was surely delivered by chairman Keith Hellawell in September, when he refused to resign. A great year for fiction \u2026 in British politics The Man Booker prize for fiction went to Paul Beatty in 2016 for The Sellout \u2013 and no doubt it was well deserved too. But it was scandalous what names were missed off the shortlist. Somehow the judges overlooked the claims of the Leave campaign in June\u2019s referendum for \u201cWe send the EU \u00a3350m a week: let\u2019s fund our NHS instead\u201d as well as its rivals in the Remain camp for all sorts of far-fetched plots in its entry, Project Fear. Pages from that tome included IMF boss Christine Lagarde\u2019s \u201cWe have done our homework and we haven\u2019t found anything positive to say about a Brexit vote\u201d; JP Morgan chief Jamie Dimon\u2019s warning he could cut 4,000 UK jobs if Britain voted to leave the EU; plus, of course, then chancellor George Osborne\u2019s warning that he\u2019d have to slash public spending and increase taxes in an emergency budget to tackle a \u00a330bn \u201cblack hole\u201d. We did vote to leave, of course, and FTSE quickly crashed, making all of the above look quite smart. The FTSE then rose above where it was before and never got that low again \u2013 while economic data stubbornly refused to fit in with the Remainers\u2019 expectations. They currently look less smart. Shy and retiring Green heads for a big bash It is now eight months since BHS collapsed and six months since its former owner Sir Philip Green promised to \u201csort\u201d the \u00a3571m pension deficit. BHS is still bust while Green is still working on a solution (and shouting at people). That is despite a year in which the constantly cross shopkeeper has been battling it out with his old pal Mike Ashley for the Fred Goodwin Silver Salver, which this page likes to award to Britain\u2019s most despised business person. Green\u2019s reputation plummeted in 2016 after BHS failed just a year after he had sold the business to the astonishingly unsuitable Dominic Chappell for \u00a31. Both men were then hauled in front of a joint select committee to explain themselves, an exercise that only succeeded in trashing their reputations some more. The MPs found that the department store had been subjected to \u201csystematic plunder\u201d by former owners, while Green gave \u201cinsufficient priority\u201d to the pension scheme. Still, let\u2019s look on the bright side. Green is partial to having a small birthday party every five years (you know the sort of thing: music by Stevie Wonder, topless modelling by Simon Cowell) and his 2017 birthday is a significant one. In March, the retailing knight turns 65, at which point he\u2019ll be able to draw his state, er, pension. So, Vladimir, where do you keep your savings? April saw the release of the Panama Papers, an unprecedented leak of 11.5 million files from the database of the world\u2019s fourth biggest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The records were obtained from an anonymous source by the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The ICIJ then shared them with a large network of international partners, including the Guardian, Observer and the BBC. Perhaps the most startling tale to emerge was the network of secret offshore deals and vast loans worth $2bn laying a trail to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin. The president\u2019s name did not appear in any of the records, but his friends earned millions from deals that seemingly could not have been secured without his patronage, while the documents suggested Putin\u2019s family benefited from this money. The leak also showed a Panama-based offshore trust set up by David Cameron\u2019s late father had benefited the then prime minister. He ended up making a complete hash of his response by stalling for three days, with four partial statements issued by Downing Street, before confessing he owned shares in the tax haven fund, which he sold for \u00a331,500 just before becoming PM in 2010. Putin\u2019s year improved. Cameron\u2019s didn\u2019t. Gears start to grind in the gig economy Not a great year if you run a business in the so-called gig economy, as a number of moves threatened to improve the lot of workers at firms from Hermes to Deliveroo to Uber \u2013 and, possibly, undermine their business models. The UK\u2019s chief taxman referred Hermes to HMRC compliance officers following complaints by couriers that they were being paid at levels equivalent to below the \u201cnational living wage\u201d. The move came after newspaper reports revealed that some self-employed couriers for the company, which delivers for retailers including John Lewis and Next, were taking home less than the legal minimum. Some 78 couriers subsequently made complaints to Frank Field, the chairman of the Commons work and pensions select committee. Meanwhile, Deliveroo was told in August that it must pay its workers the minimum wage unless a court rules that they are self-employed, while in November delivery firm CitySprint became embroiled in a similar dispute over the gig economy, when it faced demands to treat its freelance couriers as workers. That came a month after a tribunal ruled that Uber drivers were not self-employed and should be paid the national living wage, in a landmark case which could affect tens of thousands of workers in the gig economy. Uber immediately said it would appeal. The long and the short of it, courtesy of Sky \u201cIf there is one issue I regard as crucial to successful investment, it is the need for a long-term approach ... Many people in the financial services industry now acknowledge the need for a seismic shift to long-termism, though sometimes this looks like lip service.\u201d That was Martin Gilbert, boss of Aberdeen Asset Management, in a blogpost in 2015. And it is also the same Gilbert who, wearing another hat as deputy chairman of Sky, sought instant gratification by waving through the idea that Rupert Murdoch\u2019s \u00a310.75-a-share bid for the TV group was fair \u2013 a conclusion he and his committee came to \u201cafter a period of negotiation\u201d that lasted about 48 hours. Anyway, through 21st Century Fox Murdoch formally lodged an \u00a311.7bn bid in December to take control of the two-thirds of Sky he doesn\u2019t already own, meaning he will now need to gain regulatory approval for the deal, which values Sky at more than \u00a318bn. If it goes through, he would control Sky\u2019s operations in the UK, Germany and Italy in addition to his ownership of the Times, Sunday Times and Sun, and the radio group TalkSport. Still, some shareholders and analysts accuse Sky of selling on the cheap, pointing out that the shares were at the offer level as recently as February. How Glasenberg dug himself out of a hole Considering he has made a habit of topping \u201cnot-so-rich\u201d lists since floating Glencore in 2011, 2016 was a stellar year for the commodity trader\u2019s second-largest shareholder and chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg. The shares have soared by about 200%, taking the value of his holding to more than \u00a33bn and alleviating the crisis that reduced Glasenberg to his last billion. That turnaround was achieved by hauling Glencore out of its debt hole. Borrowings have been reduced from $30bn to $17.5bn by selling $6bn of assets, cutting expenditure and raising $2.5bn of fresh capital at 125p a share. Glasenberg himself had to write a $211m cheque during that cash call (which is rather impressive) but that punt has paid off handsomely and dividends are set to resume next year. Still, let\u2019s not be too charitable. For all the successes of 2016, it merely reversed some of the pain of previous years. Glasenberg\u2019s aggressive use of debt created the crisis for the company and the shares are still only worth about half of what they were when they listed at 530p, almost six years ago. Something like 2016\u2019s performance is required in 2017, therefore. Leicester won \u2013 but the bookies didn\u2019t lose When Leicester City won the Premier League in May \u2013 having started the season as a 5,000-1 shot \u2013 all the quoted bookmakers started whining that they had paid out \u00a325m, which was dubbed \u201cthe biggest loss in British history on a single sporting market\u201d. What a load of old nonsense that was. What really happened was the bookies coined it in all season on the back of unbelievably freakish results, only to hand a fraction of that back at the death. Even so, as this page never tires of pointing out, the myth of the bookies being fleeced by Leicester\u2019s triumph comes second only to the even more unbelievable line that the Foxes\u2019 triumph was football\u2019s \u201cgreatest fairytale\u201d. No: it was only the third-greatest footballing fairytale in the East Midlands in the past 44 years.",

Many people in the financial services industry now acknowledge the need for a seismic shift to long-termism, though sometimes this looks like lip service.\u201d</p> <p>That was Martin Gilbert, boss of Aberdeen Asset Management, in a blogpost in 2015. And it is also the same Gilbert who, wearing another hat as deputy chairman of Sky, sought instant gratification by waving through the idea that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/09/the-sky-takeover-deal-all-you-need-to-know\" title=\"\">Rupert Murdoch\u2019s \u00a310.75-a-share bid for the TV group</a> was fair \u2013 a conclusion he and his committee came to \u201cafter a period of negotiation\u201d that lasted about 48 hours.</p> <p>Anyway, through 21st Century Fox Murdoch formally lodged an \u00a311.7bn bid in December to take control of the two-thirds of Sky he doesn\u2019t already own, meaning he will now need to gain regulatory approval for the deal, which values Sky at more than \u00a318bn.</p> <p>If it goes through, he would control Sky\u2019s operations in the UK, Germany and Italy in addition to his ownership of the <em>Times, Sunday Times</em> and <em>Sun</em>, and the radio group TalkSport.</p> <p>Still, some shareholders and analysts accuse Sky of selling on the cheap, pointing out that the shares were at the offer level as recently as February.</p> <h2><strong>How Glasenberg dug himself out of a hole</strong></h2> <p>Considering he has made a habit of topping \u201cnot-so-rich\u201d lists since floating Glencore in 2011, 2016 was a stellar year for the commodity trader\u2019s second-largest shareholder and chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/05/glencore-ivan-glasenberg-dividend-profits\" title=\"\">Ivan Glasenberg</a>.</p> <p>The shares have soared by about 200%, taking the value of his holding to more than \u00a33bn and alleviating the crisis that reduced Glasenberg to his last billion.</p> <p>That turnaround was achieved by hauling Glencore out of its debt hole. Borrowings have been reduced from $30bn to $17.5bn by selling $6bn of assets, cutting expenditure and raising $2.5bn of fresh capital at 125p a share. Glasenberg himself had to write a $211m cheque during that cash call (which is rather impressive) but that punt has paid off handsomely and dividends are set to resume next year.</p> <p>Still, let\u2019s not be too charitable. For all the successes of 2016, it merely reversed some of the pain of previous years. Glasenberg\u2019s aggressive use of debt created the crisis for the company and the shares are still only worth about half of what they were when they listed at 530p, almost six years ago. Something like 2016\u2019s performance is required in 2017, therefore.</p> <h2><strong>Leicester won \u2013 but the bookies didn\u2019t lose</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ff9dc9c93fb9a21e9a12f9ff9c4629895fb81a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ff9dc9c93fb9a21e9a12f9ff9c4629895fb81a8/0_177_3643_2186/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leicester City players on a bus during their championship parade\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leicester City: not the bookies\u2019 nightmare one might imagine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Leicester City won the Premier League in May \u2013 having started the season as a 5,000-1 shot \u2013 all the quoted bookmakers started whining that they had paid out \u00a325m, which was dubbed \u201cthe biggest loss in British history on a single sporting market\u201d.</p> <p>What a load of old nonsense that was. What really happened was the bookies coined it in all season on the back of unbelievably freakish results, only to hand a fraction of that back at the death.</p> <p>Even so, as this page never tires of pointing out, the myth of the bookies being fleeced by Leicester\u2019s triumph comes second only to the even more unbelievable line that the Foxes\u2019 triumph was football\u2019s \u201cgreatest fairytale\u201d. No: it was only the third-greatest footballing fairytale in the East Midlands in the past 44 years.</p>",

Unfortunately, unless sense prevails, the rest of us will also suffer the product of their wild oats. The absurdity, indeed perils, of Brexit become more obvious by the month. Business is nervous; so is the City, which constitutes far more hundreds of thousands of employees than the small, avaricious band of bankers who made their notorious contribution to the financial crisis. It would be good if the majority of members of parliament could recall and act upon Edmund Burke\u2019s 1774 address to the electors of Bristol: they should summon up the courage to act as representatives, not delegates of constituencies where they fear the threat from the xenophobic forces conjured up by the likes of Nigel Farage (who shamelessly continues to draw a handsome salary from an EU institution he affects to abhor). They should capitalise on the increasing signs of nervousness and potential panic among the leading Brexiters. For the diehard Liam Fox to decide that perhaps, after all, we should remain in the customs union was rather interesting. The personal attacks by parliamentary Brexiters on our ambassador to the European Union, Sir Ivan Rogers, were indicative of panic in the victorious ranks. The occasion was the leaking of advice given to Theresa May, in which Rogers suggested trade renegotiations with the EU could last 10 years. This revelation provoked an unpleasant ad hominem attack on a distinguished civil servant who, in the best traditions of Whitehall, \u201ctells it like it is\u201d to the occupant of No 10, whether that be David Cameron or Theresa May. The plain, hard fact of the matter, which the Brexiters refuse to grasp, is that the other 27 members of the EU were desperate for us to vote to Remain, but were never going to roll over to the Brexiters\u2019 proposals for a swift offer to this country to \u201chave its cake and eat it\u201d. Here we come to an interesting historical development. Rogers, while now occupying a vitally important post at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, is himself essentially a Treasury man. And the Treasury, unlike the Foreign Office, has traditionally been suspicious of the European Union. But Rogers knows which side this country\u2019s bread is buttered, and neither our diplomatic nor economic interest is likely to be served by Brexit. In which context, I was especially struck by the way a former Treasury official, who in days gone by was persistently vitriolic in his comments on the EU, recently contacted me to ask whether the nation had lost its senses. The problem at the moment is that the damage caused by the referendum is on a slow-burning fuse. There are time lags in these matters: the impact on prices and real earnings from the collapse of the pound will become more evident as the year progresses. As it becomes clear that the Brexiters who have captured the prime minister do not have a convincing strategy, plans for major firms to relocate their investments to continental Europe will gradually be implemented. Meanwhile I have also been struck by the number of people who have contacted me to express astonishment at the Boxing Day intervention of Mervyn King, Mark Carney\u2019s predecessor as governor of the Bank of England. Lord King has come out as a Brexiter, which is not very helpful to his successor, who can sense a prospective train crash and was quite right to warn about the impact on the pound of a Leave vote \u2013 and who, with the help of his colleagues at the Bank, has been doing his best to keep the show on the road since. But King has long been a Eurosceptic \u2013 not just about the eurozone, on which issue I share his concerns, but also about the European Union itself. Personally, I think Brexiters such as King underestimate the damage not only to our trade from Brexit, but also the extent of the sacrifice of our potential contribution to the future of the EU in a troubled world. However, I note even King concedes that Brexit will not be a bed of roses. He was, of course, speaking to the BBC\u2019s Today programme, which ever since the beginning of the referendum campaign seems to have gone out of its way to give prominence to Monsieur Farage and his ilk. They were at it again last week, with the shameless Michael Gove heavily revising his castigation of \u201cexperts\u201d, seemingly narrowing the field of the accused to the category of economic forecasters. Well, forecasters do their best. But economists probably regret the way that their noble trade has been associated too much in the public mind with forecasting, as opposed to fundamental economic analysis. Anyway, while wishing readers as happy a new year as events allow, I should like to end with this wonderful quote from Jan Kamieniecki in a letter to the Financial Times: \u201cI suspect that what Michael Gove meant to say was that the people in this country have had enough of exports.\u201d",
