      "bodyText": "Labor has flagged a plan to crack down on clauses in work contracts that make it hard for employees to work for competitors when they leave a job. It has also renewed calls for large corporations to pay bigger financial penalties for abusing their market power, and for the competition regulator to be given greater powers to prevent market problems emerging. Andrew Leigh, the shadow assistant treasurer, will warn in a speech on Wednesday that competition in Australia is getting worse, with too many industries dominated by three or four firms and fewer new businesses starting up as a consequence. The Turnbull government is pushing ahead with its 0.06% levy on the after-tax profits of Australia\u2019s biggest banks, arguing their market dominance has made them some of the most profitable banks in the world. Leigh says Australia is experiencing a rise in companies using their market power for anti-competitive reasons, with complaints to the competition watchdog, of misleading and deceptive conduct, up one third over the last three years. He says despite the Coalition\u2019s rhetoric about innovation and agility, the rate at which new businesses are being created in Australia has actually slowed, warning something needs to be done about our \u201cgrowing competition problem\u201d. \u201cBack in the 2000s we would typically see a 17% increase in the number of new businesses each year,\u201d Leigh says, in notes seen by Guardian Australia. \u201cSince 2010, this has fallen to 13%. For all the talk of incubators, accelerators and innovation, our nation isn\u2019t starting as many businesses as it used to.\u201d Leigh will make his comments when he delivers the Sir Walter Murdoch school policy seminar at Murdoch University. He will also raise concerns about the growing number of non-compete clauses in employment contracts which prevent employees from working for a competitor, starting a competing firm, or poaching customers from old employers. Citing work by academics from Melbourne University and Monash University, he will warn large Australian firms are using non-compete clauses more frequently, and suggests something may have to be done about it. \u201cNon-compete clauses make it harder for employees to switch to a better job and stifle start-ups,\u201d Leigh will say. \u201cSince many new companies are created by employees who leave to start a competing company, non-compete clauses reduce innovation. \u201cWe need to make it easier for more competitors to enter the market. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for firms to prevent ex-employees stealing confidential information, but non-compete clauses are a sledgehammer to crack a nut. \u201cStudies show that making these clauses unenforceable \u2013 as California has done \u2013 leads to an upsurge in innovation.\u201d Leigh will also say the government needs to give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission a market studies function, to allow it to investigate concentrated sectors and propose solutions before competition problems emerge into public view. \u201cA market studies power would have allowed Australia\u2019s competition watchdog to initiate its own inquiry into the energy sector without waiting for a specific reference from the federal government,\u201d Leigh will say. \u201cIan Harper\u2019s 2015 competition review recommended a strong market studies power and the ACCC has repeatedly requested such a power. \u201c[And] when it comes to deterring bad behaviour, our laws are only as powerful as the penalties courts can impose. \u201cTo clearly signal that corporate wrongdoing doesn\u2019t pay, we\u2019ve advocated linking the penalty for anti-competitive conduct to total sales. Such a move would bring Australian penalties into line with jurisdictions such as the European Union.\u201d Joydeep Hor, the managing principal of law firm People &amp; Culture Strategies, told Guardian Australia non-compete clauses were critical to many businesses, but they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to deliver a competitive benefit to an employer.",

Speaking at the International Air Transport Association\u2019s annual summit, Oscar Munoz, the chief executive of United Airlines, who was lambasted for his non-apology to a passenger who was injured when forcibly removed from an overbooked flight, said: \u201cWe have to become more flexible and more communicative about things.\u201d But while Munoz said he wanted to defend his 85,000 staff, he added that he had ignored his own instincts to apologise because of \u201cthe force on me from many folks advising me\u201d. He said: \u201cIn a crisis of that magnitude, evolving that quickly, you tend to learn and talk to too many people.\u201d With more time, he said, \u201cmy initial response with my name on it would have been different\u201d. Peter Bellew, the chief executive of Malaysia Airlines, said the rise of social media had made a swift response imperative. Bellew joined the airline after the loss of two passenger jets in 2014 with hundreds of fatalities. Last week a passenger claiming to have a bomb caused panic on a Malaysia flight from Melbourne, forcing the plane to turn back before it was stormed by police. Bellew said: \u201cI think you\u2019ve got 15 minutes or less to say sorry. People were livestreaming on Facebook what was happening, because the aircraft was under 14,000 feet. That\u2019s the pressure you\u2019re under now. It\u2019s horrendous.\u201d When a flight from London to Kuala Lumpur was hit by severe turbulence last year, Bellew sent senior staff to greet affected passengers. \u201cYou can\u2019t sit in silence any more.\u201d He said by getting on the scene in the terminals, \u201cyou can stop the whole thing in that instant\u201d.

Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA\u2019s owner, IAG, admitted on Monday that the airline had got its communications wrong. Yet the PR fallout is continuing, with passengers still complaining of not being contacted, let alone having their compensation claims processed \u2013 and some still to be united with their baggage. Scott and Dianna Smeal, on holiday from Atlanta, Georgia, were caught up in the chaos for hours en route with BA from Bergen to Glasgow, when their bags were lost. They had still received no information about the location of their luggage nine days later. \u201cIt has been a completely frustrating experience,\u201d Smeal said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Burberry is to hand Christopher Bailey shares worth \u00a310.5m next month when day-to-day management of the luxury goods retailer switches to a newly recruited chief executive. Bailey is to receive 600,000 of the 1m shares he was awarded in 2013, at a time when the company was concerned he might be poached by a rival. The Yorkshire-born designer was named chief executive later that year \u2013 in addition to his previous role as chief creative officer. Holding both roles proved to be controversial with shareholders and he will become president of the business next month when Marco Gobbetti becomes chief executive after joining from French luxury brand C\u00e9line earlier in the year. Bailey will receive the rest of the 1m shares at a later date and at the current share price of \u00a317.65 the 600,000 that he will receive are worth about \u00a310.5m. The annual report published on Tuesday shows that Bailey was paid \u00a33.5m last year \u2013 up from the \u00a31.9m the previous year. While he waived his entitlement to any annual bonus for the year, his total was boosted by a \u00a31.4m payout from a further award of shares in 2014. Bailey could have received a maximum of 125,000 shares from that particular award, but is instead receiving 77,000 after the performance of the company was taken into account. In 2014 the company had endured a bruising annual meeting with its shareholders, who voted against its remuneration report to protest about Bailey\u2019s pay. His pay deals also include a \u00a3440,000 allowance to cover clothes and other items. Bailey\u2019s salary will remain at \u00a31.1m when he becomes president next month, following a year in which underlying profits fell by 21%. The chairman, Sir John Peace, said in his introduction to the annual report: \u201cSince taking on the combined role of chief creative and chief executive officer, Christopher has made significant progress against a backdrop of challenging market conditions.\u201d The report spells out changes to pay deals at Burberry for the future to reduce \u201cthe overall maximum potential quantum\u201d: maximum bonuses will be 200% of salary for executives rather than 225% and maximum relocation bonuses cut to \u00a3200,000 from \u00a3250,000. Gobbetti, who takes over as chief executive on 5 July, has a \u00a31.1m salary and a \u00a380,000 allowance for clothing, a car and travel. He is also receiving a share deal of \u20ac5m (\u00a34.4m) to buy him out of his pay deal with his previous employer. His appointment is part of a series of management changes at Burberry, which has also hired Julie Brown from medical supplies group Smith &amp; Nephew as chief operating officer and chief financial officer. Between January and March 2017 she received \u00a34.7m, including a \u00a34.5m buyout consisting of \u00a34m in shares and \u00a3550,000 in cash.",

      "bodyText": "Investors are being rather cautious ahead of Thursday\u2019s UK election, ECB meeting and the testimony by ex-FBI boss James Comey. So most stock markets have fallen back again, while the dollar has hit a seven month low. Oil has recovered some of its early losses after the latest tensions in the Middle East, with Brent crude edging up 0.2% to $49.57 a barrel having fallen as low as $49. The FTSE 100 has ended virtually flat, outperforming the bulk of its European peers, as the latest polls show a Conservative lead. The FTSE 250, hit by weakness in sterling, has lost 1%, its worst daily performance since the middle of April. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 edged down 0.81 points or 0.01% at 7524.95 The FTSE 250 fell 1.08% to 19,654.84 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.04% to 12,690.12 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.73% at 5269.22 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished up 0.19% at 20,760.01 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.05% at 10,879.7 In Greece, the Athens market dropped 1.15% to 777.53 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 21 points or 0.1%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. One of the big events on Thursday is the latest meeting of the European Central Bank, with president Mario Draghi expected to make a minor shift in the tone of the bank\u2019s message. Marchel Alexandrovich, senior European economist at Jefferies, said: On Thursday the ECB is widely expected to change some of the language around its forward guidance, but the implications of these changes are likely to be downplayed by Mario Draghi during the Q&amp;A session. In the last two meetings the ECB hinted that a further cut to the depo rate was unlikely \u2013 and we expect this position to be formally confirmed in the Monetary Policy Decisions statement. However, the shift to a more neutral policy stance with regards to interest rates will not affect the ECB\u2019s other key messages: the depo rate will remain at present level until after QE comes to an end; and QE will carry on until the end of the year \u201cor beyond, if necessary\u201d. All in all, the take-away is expected to be that while the ECB is taking a small step toward eventual policy normalisation, this process is not on a predetermined path. For the markets, Draghi is unlikely to provide any useful guidance in terms of when tapering may start, or what form it may take. Here\u2019s the Reuters take on the US job openings figures: U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April while hiring slowed, suggesting a recent moderation in job growth was the result of employers having difficulties finding qualified workers. The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday showed there were 6.0 million job openings on the last day of business in April, an increase of 259,000 from March. Hiring decreased by 253,000 jobs to 5.1 million. Investors are shying away from risk at the moment, with precious metals and defensive shares reaping the benefit. Gold is at its highest level in seven weeks, up $14 to $1293 an ounce, while silver is up from $17.54 to $17.68 an ounce. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: There has been a clear shift into haven trades to protect against any fireworks following key events on Thursday. Brits heading to the polls, central bankers deciding interest rates in Europe and testimony from FBI Director Comey all pose a threat. With three big events clustered in one day, it only takes one to go way to set things off. Stocks mostly retreated with a tendency for more defensive areas of the market to outperform. Utilities, a typical haven when staying invested in stocks rose over half-a-percent on the Euro Stoxx 600 while most other sectors were lower... A 1% decline in the FTSE 250 while FTSE 100 was essentially flat on the day was notable. Investors appear to be shunning UK domestic shares before the election. Within the broader FTSE 350, retail shares were biggest decliners, which are typically closely tied to the health of the British economy. While a Labour victory remains a distant outlier, polls would indicate a hung parliament is possible. The fear is that with the country entering at least two-years of economic uncertainty because of the Brexit negotiations, higher personal and business taxes under a new government could tip the economy over the edge. And here are the job openings figures, and they have come in at a record high. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, job openings rose from a revised 5.78m in March to 6m in April, the highest level since the survey began. But hires were weaker, falling from 5.3m to 5m while the quits rate edged marginally lower from 2.2% to 2.1%. Last week\u2019s US non-farm payroll numbers were much weaker than expected, but analysts agreed they were unlikely to prevent the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates next week. But some observers suggested they could slow down the pace of any further rises. Another set of US jobs data is due shortly, and it is one that Fed chair Janet Yellen is known to pay particular attention too, even if it is not as well followed as the non-farm numbers. The Job Openings and Labor Turnovers Survey (JOLTS) gives another snapshot of the state of the employment market, with indications on job openings, hiring, layoffs and the quit rate. The latter in particular, if it is increasing, shows a more optimistic market, if employees feel confident enough to leave their jobs in search of new ones. However David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said the job opening figure could see a decline on last month: The expectation is for 5.65 million, and that compares with 5.74 million in March. This report will be of particular importance given the disappointing non-farm payroll figure last week. Ahead of Thursday\u2019s triple whammy of the UK election, European Central Bank meeting and ex-FBI director James Comey\u2019s testimony, US markets are following the trend elsewhere and heading lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 57 points or 0.28% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.26% lower and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.22%. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is down 0.26%, the FTSE 250 has fallen 0.95%, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1% and France\u2019s Cac is 0.8% lower. The weakness in the pound is a factor behind a drop in the FTSE 250. At one point, the mid-cap index was on track for its worst day since November although it has recovered from its worst levels. Even so, the index is down 0.9% and currently sitting at a near three week low as jitters about the UK election continue to unsettle investors. To be fair, the mid-cap index has been hitting new highs in recent days so the day\u2019s fall needs to be seen in that context. After a bright start to the morning, the British pound has taken a lurch lower. Sterling is now down 0.2% today at $1.2875, as traders worry about Thursday\u2019s general election. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, says sterling is \u201ccoming under renewed pressure from polls showing the Conservative Party\u2019s out-sized lead dwindling.\u201d Those polls have left investors scratching their heads. Last night, Survation released a phone poll giving the Conservatives a lead of just 1 percentage point. Other pollsters have reported a much wider gap, with ICM putting Theresa May 11 points ahead. And then there\u2019s YouGov, whose controversial daily seat projections suggests the Conservatives will fall short of a majority. Back in the UK, one of the bankers at the centre of the 2008 financial crisis is being spared from giving evidence about his actions in court. A group of Royal Bank of Scotland shareholders have settled their claim that they were misled when they backed its rights issue in 2008, shortly before its collapse. That means that Fred Goodwin, who lost his knighthood after RBS was nationalised, will not have to answer questions about the bank\u2019s demise. Here\u2019s the full story: The South African rand has slumped to 12.875 to the US dollar, down from 12.7 yesterday. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM suspects it could fall further: Sentiment towards the South African economy took a hit on Tuesday following reports of the nation falling into a technical recession for the first time since 2009. The latest GDP data released by Stats SA showed that the economy declined by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2017 with all industries excluding agriculture and mining contracting. Despite this decline, there remains some optimism over GDP growth finding some ground and rebounding to 0.7% in the second quarter of 2017 amid the stabilizing economic data seen in recent months. The South African Rand weakened following this news with the USDZAR edging towards 12.9000. Repeated weakness from the Rand should encourage a further incline towards 13.0000 on the USDZAR. South Africa\u2019s slide into recession piles more pressure on president Jacob Zuma. Zuma was already feeling the heat over his links to the wealthy and influential Gupta family. Last week, leaked emails purported to show that the Gupta family had used their friendship with Zuma to advance their business interests. Zuma had previously repeatedly denied allegations that the Guptas had unfairly won state contracts, and even influenced the choice of government ministers. Magda Wierzycka, CEO of financial services group Sygnia, says South Africa\u2019s leaders need to focus on fixing its economy: The full South African GDP report is online here. This neat graphic sums it up: Here are the key points from today\u2019s South African growth report. In the first quarter of 2017, both the secondary and tertiary sectors recorded negative growth rates. Trade growth shrank by 5.9% and manufacturing by 3,7%. On the positive side, the agriculture and mining industries both contributed positively to growth in the first quarter, but not enough to avoid recession. Trade experienced production falls across the board, particularly in catering and accommodation and wholesale trade. Manufacturing found itself hamstrung by lower production levels in seven of its 10 divisions, most notably petroleum and chemical products (accounting for over 20% of the manufacturing industry). It was the third consecutive quarter of decline in total manufacturing. The tertiary sector, which is make up of finance, transport, trade, government and personal services, recorded its first quarter of decline since the second quarter of 2009, when South Africa was in a recession as well. Social media users in South Africa have been reacting to the news: Emerging markets analyst John Ashbourne confirms that today\u2019s growth figures are much worse then expected: Statistics South Africa deputy director general Joe de Beer has confirmed that the country is in recession, saying: \u201cWe can now pronounce that the economy is in recession,\u201d \u201cThe major industries that contracted in the economy were the trade and manufacturing sectors.\u201d Bloomberg is reporting that South Africa\u2019s economy has been dragged into recession by political infighting. That row saw the country\u2019s respected finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, sacked three months ago, alarming international investors. Bloomberg says: While rains are helping Africa\u2019s most-industrialized economy recover from a 2015 drought that was the worst since records started more than a century earlier, political uncertainty has hampered implementing reforms aimed at boosting growth. President Jacob Zuma changed his cabinet and fired Pravin Gordhan as finance minister in March, a move that saw the nation lose its investment-grade status with two ratings companies for the first time in 17 years. \u201cThere is a risk that these contractions are not over and we could see another negative coming out in the second quarter of this year,\u201d Annabel Bishop, the chief economist at Investec Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg. More here: S. Africa Has Second Recession in 8 Years as Economy Shrinks The South African rand has has slumped by 1% on the foreign exchange markets, as traders react with alarm to the disappointing GDP figures. Breaking: South Africa has fallen back into recession, for the second time in eight years. South Africa\u2019s economy shrank by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2017, figures just released show. That follows a 0.3% contraction in the final three months of 2016; two consecutive quarters of contraction mean a recession. The downturn was caused by a sharp contraction in trade. Manufacturing output also shrank, while government and household spending both fell too. Government agency Stats SA has tweeted the key points: It\u2019s something of a shock. Economists had expected growth to rebound in the last quarter. Details and reaction to follow..... European markets have weakened this morning, dragged down by worries over America\u2019s economy and the diplomatic row between Qatar and its neighbours. Despite the jump in eurozone investor confidence, all the main indices are in the red today. Risk aversion is gripping the markets, driving money out of shares and into gold and the Japanese yen. Signs that the Britain\u2019s general election race is tightening are also gripping the City. Joshua Mahony of IG explains: On a day which is largely devoid of major economic releases, the focus remains firmly fixed on Thursday\u2019s blockbuster schedule and what it could mean for the future of politics either side of the Atlantic. UK election polls have been widely conflicting of late, reflecting the significant impact different methodology has upon results. Previously we have seen the pound fall with any mention of a hung parliament, yet with the pound rising gradually over recent weeks, it is clear that the markets continue to foresee a Tory majority. More eurozone data just landed, showing that retail sales crept higher in April. Retail spending across the eurozone rose by 0.1%, weaker than the 0.2% which the City expects. On an annual basis, spending was 2.5% higher than in April 2016. Breaking: Investors across the eurozone are at their most confident in a decade! The monthly gauge of investor morale produced by Sentix has risen to 28.4 points this month, up from 27.4 in May. That\u2019s the highest reading since July 2007 (just before the credit crunch struck, triggering the financial crisis). Investors reported that the current economic situation has improved, and they\u2019re also more optimistic about future economic prospects. The data suggest that Europe\u2019s recovery is gathering pace, Sentix says: The assessment of the current situation has climbed to the highest level since January 2008, underlining that it is not just ephemeral expectations, but increasingly hard data, that are driving the upswing in the eurozone. The cost of renting a home in the UK has fallen for the first time since the financial crisis, as the slowdown in the sector gathers pace. Average rents were down 0.3% in May, compared with a year earlier, at \u00a3901, according to industry body HomeLet. This is the first annual decline since 2009, Rents in London are 3% lower than a year ago; they\u2019re also down in the North-East of England, the South-East, Yorkshire &amp; Humberside, and Scotland. It\u2019s good news for tenants, but a painful time for landlords. HomeLet\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Martin Totty, says: \u201cMay 2017 saw average rents nationally fall for the first time in eight years when the economy had suffered the shock of the financial crisis. HomeLet rental data suggests landlords are now facing a difficult balancing act between ensuring rents are affordable for tenants in a low real wage growth environment whilst covering their own rising costs.\u201d Financial advisor Claire Walsh reckons Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU is now rippling through the economy: The Japanese yen has hit a six-week high against the US dollar, as traders dash for safe-haven assets. Russian intrigue and the looming UK general election are to blame, says FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed: In currency markets, the dollar fell to lowest levels in six weeks against the Yen. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising given the scale of event risks this Thursday, specifically UK\u2019s general election and former FBI director James Comey testifying before the US Senate intelligence committee about potential Russian interference in 2016\u2019s US election. The weakening dollar is good news for the pound, which has gained 0.3% to $1.293 this morning. The US dollar has fallen to its lowest level since Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Investors appear to be increasingly anxious about the American economy, after learning yesterday that its services sector grew slower than expected in May. That followed Friday\u2019s underwhelming US labour report, showing fewer jobs created than expected. Markets are also bracing for potential bombshells on Thursday, when former FBI chief James Comey is due to testify to Congress. That appearance could provide more problems for president Trump. As Reuters puts it: It has been reported that Comey plans to testify to conversations in which U.S. President Donald Trump pressured him to drop his investigation into former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn, who was fired for failing to disclose conversations with Russian officials. Online electrical chain AO World has added to the gloom in the retail sector this morning, with an underwhelming set of results. AO World, which sells domestic appliances as well as computers, has warned the City that sales will slow \u201csignificantly\u201d between April and June, its first quarter. It said the tough trading environment in the UK that hit sales in the second half of last year had continued into its new financial year. Its operating loss for the year to 31 March widened to \u00a312m from \u00a310.6m, as a \u00a315.6m profit in the UK was offset by losses in Germany and the Netherlands. The company was founded in 2000 by John Roberts, a former kitchen salesman, who ran the business as chief executive until February. When it floated on the stock market three years ago the shares soared \u2013 but soon dipped below the 285p offer price. They are now worth just 136p, after tumbling by 6% in early trading today. Brushing aside the difficulties, the new chief executive Steve Caunce said: \u201cWe remain relentless in pursuing our goal to be the best electrical retailer in Europe.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With two days to go until the UK general election, we have new evidence that parts of Britain\u2019s economy are slowing. UK retail sales shrank by 0.4% in May, according to the latest healthcheck from the British Retail Consortium. The report found that households are cutting back as rising inflation hits them in the pocket. Worryingly, people have less to spend on discretionary items once they\u2019ve covered essentials such as food. Online sales -- typically a big growth area -- also slowed. They only rose by 4.3% during the month, compared to over 13% a year ago. Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said many shoppers are now suffering from falling real wages, leaving them less to spend in the shops. \u201cThe impact of inflationary pressures on the nation\u2019s purse continues to play out in this month\u2019s figures, with shoppers evidently spending more on food and drink than on non-food purchases. \u201cWith inflation continuing to rise and wage growth stagnating, consumers are starting to feel the pinch - although the highly competitive nature of the UK grocery market continues to play out in the consumer\u2019s favour. Here\u2019s Katie Allen\u2019s full report: That\u2019s set the tone for a rather subdued day, with many stock markets in Asia dipping and the US dollar coming under pressure. The agenda: Today we\u2019ll find out whether eurozone retail sales kept growing in April, and whether investors across Europe remain confident. 9:30am BST: Sentix\u2019s eurozone investor confidence survey for June 10:00am BST: Eurozone retail sales for April 3pm BST: US Jolts report, showing how many job vacancies were created in America last month",

So most stock markets have fallen back again, while the dollar has hit a seven month low. Oil has recovered some of its early losses after the latest tensions in the Middle East, with Brent crude edging up 0.2% to $49.57 a barrel having fallen as low as $49.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 has ended virtually flat, outperforming the bulk of its European peers, as the latest polls show a Conservative lead. The FTSE 250, hit by weakness in sterling, has lost 1%, its worst daily performance since the middle of April. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 edged down 0.81 points or 0.01% at 7524.95</strong></li> <li><strong>The FTSE 250 fell 1.08% to 19,654.84</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.04% to 12,690.12</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.73% at 5269.22</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished up 0.19% at 20,760.01</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.05% at 10,879.7</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market dropped 1.15% to 777.53</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 21 points or 0.1%.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day.

Marchel Alexandrovich, senior European economist at Jefferies, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On Thursday the ECB is widely expected to change some of the language around its forward guidance, but the implications of these changes are likely to be downplayed by Mario Draghi during the Q&amp;A session.</p> <p>In the last two meetings the ECB hinted that a further cut to the depo rate was unlikely \u2013 and we expect this position to be formally confirmed in the Monetary Policy Decisions statement. However, the shift to a more neutral policy stance with regards to interest rates will not affect the ECB\u2019s other key messages: the depo rate will remain at present level until after QE comes to an end; and QE will carry on until the end of the year \u201cor beyond, if necessary\u201d.</p> <p>All in all, the take-away is expected to be that while the ECB is taking a small step toward eventual policy normalisation, this process is not on a predetermined path. For the markets, Draghi is unlikely to provide any useful guidance in terms of when tapering may start, or what form it may take.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5acae04e7749d6fda38f88309732f6c55f0cd55f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5acae04e7749d6fda38f88309732f6c55f0cd55f/0_148_3080_1849/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Draghi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draghi</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5936c681e4b00493c8279f62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-06T15:13:33.943Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s the Reuters take on the US job openings figures:</p> <blockquote> <p>U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April while hiring slowed, suggesting a recent moderation in job growth was the result of employers having difficulties finding qualified workers.</p> <p>The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department on Tuesday showed there were 6.0 million job openings on the last day of business in April, an increase of 259,000 from March.

Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has been a clear shift into haven trades to protect against any fireworks following key events on Thursday. Brits heading to the polls, central bankers deciding interest rates in Europe and testimony from FBI Director Comey all pose a threat. With three big events clustered in one day, it only takes one to go way to set things off.</p> <p>Stocks mostly retreated with a tendency for more defensive areas of the market to outperform. Utilities, a typical haven when staying invested in stocks rose over half-a-percent on the Euro Stoxx 600 while most other sectors were lower...</p> <p>A 1% decline in the FTSE 250 while FTSE 100 was essentially flat on the day was notable. Investors appear to be shunning UK domestic shares before the election. Within the broader FTSE 350, retail shares were biggest decliners, which are typically closely tied to the health of the British economy. While a Labour victory remains a distant outlier, polls would indicate a hung parliament is possible. The fear is that with the country entering at least two-years of economic uncertainty because of the Brexit negotiations, higher personal and business taxes under a new government could tip the economy over the edge.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5936bb8be4b0bdd87e2f3e75\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-06T14:33:18.889Z\">3.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nick_bunker/status/872097945117655041\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JOLTS?src=hash\">#JOLTS</a> Graph time!

The Job Openings and Labor Turnovers Survey (JOLTS) gives another snapshot of the state of the employment market, with indications on job openings, hiring, layoffs and the quit rate.

      "bodyText": "Vodafone is to introduce a tough new global policy to prevent its advertising from appearing on fake news and hate speech sites. The telecoms company, which spends close to \u00a3400m of its \u00a3750m annual global ad budget on digital ads, is thought to be the first to move beyond relying on Google and Facebook\u2019s automated technology. Working with Google, Facebook and ad agencies, it is setting up a \u201cwhitelist\u201d of sites on which its ads can run. \u201cIt is relatively easy to blacklist certain sites, such as those relating to porn and gambling, but it is difficult to exclude content that is \u2013 in editorial terms \u2013 at odds with an advertiser\u2019s own principles and beliefs,\u201d said Matt Peacock, group director of corporate affairs at Vodafone. \u201cWhen it comes to making a judgment about a site or channel focused on fake news or hate speech, what\u2019s needed is a human judgment, an editorial assessment. It\u2019s not possible to rely on algorithms alone. For that reason, we\u2019ve concluded that the best way to ensure brand safety is to use a whitelist approach.\u201d Vodafone\u2019s whitelist will feature sites it has identified as \u201chighly unlikely to be focused on harmful content\u201d. \u201cHate speech and fake news threaten to undermine the principles of respect and trust that bind communities together,\u201d said the Vodafone chief executive, Vittorio Colao. \u201cVodafone has a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion; we also greatly value the integrity of the democratic processes and institutions that are often the targets of purveyors of fake news. We will not tolerate our brand being associated with this kind of abusive and damaging content.\u201d The whitelist will be reviewed regularly to make sure it is \u201cappropriate and neither too broad nor too narrow\u201d. Vodafone\u2019s definition of sites peddling hate speech has been updated to include those that \u201cdeliberately intend to degrade women or vulnerable minorities\u201d. Its definition of fake news sites includes those \u201cpresented as fact-based news (as opposed to satire or opinion) that has no credible primary source (or relies on fraudulent attribution to a primary source) with what a reasonable person would conclude is the deliberate intention to mislead\u201d. The company said an outlet will only be blocked from its whitelist if its \u201cpredominant purpose\u201d is hate speech or fake news, meaning it will not move to block tabloid or extreme rightwing or leftwing publishers if they occasionally are at odds with its new rules. Vodafone stressed that its rules do not cover the type of content its customers can access. Facebook, which has toughened its own policies on fake news on its site, said Vodafone\u2019s new policy would work hand in hand with its own efforts. \u201cWe welcome Vodafone\u2019s new global rules,\u201d said a Facebook spokesman. \u201cWe work closely with all of our advertiser partners to ensure that they have control over where their ads appear on our platform, and vigorously enforce our community standards which include policies against hate speech, violence or extremist content.\u201d Both Google and Facebook have moved to introduce tools to stem the spread of false information and minimise the chances of advertising appearing next to inappropriate content. However, there is evidence that these are not 100% effective. \u201cWhile automated advertising is a powerful tool in a small minority of instances it can also lead to unintended and potentially harmful outcomes including advertising appearing next to offensive content,\u201d said Vodafone. \u201cAdditionally, automated advertising technologies can have the effect of generating revenue for outlets focused on hate speech and fake news.\u201d Facebook said it would \u201ccontinue to work with all advertisers to help them deliver great advertising experiences that drive business results\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Fred Goodwin has escaped being summoned to the high court to explain his actions during the 2008 financial crisis, after disgruntled shareholders finally reached a settlement with Royal Bank of Scotland. In a high-profile and potentially explosive case, thousands of investors argued they were misled into buying the bank\u2019s shares during the bank\u2019s \u00a312bn cash call in April 2008. The case had been due to start on 22 May, with the former RBS boss due to give evidence on 8 June \u2013 the day of the general election. However, the case was adjourned to 7 June to allow a settlement to be reached. The RBS shareholder action group has now accepted a settlement, removing the last major impediment to an out-of-court deal. There was no immediate comment from RBS ahead of the court hearing on Wednesday, when Mr Justice Hildyard is due to be updated on the proceedings by Jonathan Nash, QC for the shareholders. But a spokesman for the shareholder action group said: \u201cThe directors met last night to consider the legal advice. They\u2019ve accepted that advice and the matter will not now proceed to trial.\u201d Members of the action group were told last week that there were \u201cpractical and legal risks which had to be considered\u201d in agreeing a settlement at 82p \u2013 less than the price they had aimed for but double previous settlements. The case focused on losses incurred by investors when the bank was bailed out just six months after its cash call. The investors argued that RBS, Goodwin and three other former directors misled them about the financial health of the bank during the cash-raising exercise. The investors claimed \u00a3520m, the value of their lost investment, together with interest, which took their total claim to \u00a3800m. They were the last group of investors to hold out against a deal with the bank. In December, RBS announced it had \u00a3800m to share among the different groups. About 87% of investors had settled before these court proceedings were scheduled. A settlement has now been agreed, even though one group of \u201cdiehard\u201d investors continues to hold out against a deal, partly because they wanted more money and also because some were determined to see Goodwin in court. Last week they met the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, in an effort to persuade him to increase the offer, which was already double the previous settlements. Neil Mitchell, a businessman involved in a separate business legal suit against RBS, said he had met funders in the Lanesborough Hotel in London on Monday evening in an attempt to secure the millions of pounds needed to keep the case alive. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s really odd, why have the group accepted?\u201d New funding is needed after Trevor Hemmings, the football club owner and businessman who had previously been funding the case, accepted the offer. Goodwin has kept a low profile since leaving RBS at the time of its taxpayer bailout in October 2008. His last public appearance was before the Treasury select committee in February 2009. At the time he had offered the MPs his \u201cprofound and unqualified apology for all of the distress that has been caused\u201d. He was later stripped of his knighthood and eventually agreed to having his pension reduced.",

They\u2019ve accepted that advice and the matter will not now proceed to trial.\u201d </p> <p>Members of the action group were told last week that there were \u201cpractical and legal risks which had to be considered\u201d in agreeing a settlement at 82p \u2013 less than the price they had aimed for but double previous settlements.</p> <p>The case focused on losses incurred by investors when the bank was bailed out just six months after its cash call. The investors argued that RBS, Goodwin and three other former directors misled them about the financial health of the bank during the cash-raising exercise.</p> <p>The investors claimed \u00a3520m, the value of their lost investment, together with interest, which took their total claim to \u00a3800m. They were the last group of investors to hold out against a deal with the bank. In December, RBS announced it <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/05/rbs-agrees-multimillion-pound-settlement-with-shareholders\">had \u00a3800m</a> to share among the different groups.

Last week they met the RBS chief executive, Ross McEwan, in an effort to persuade him to increase the offer, which was already double the previous settlements.</p> <p>Neil Mitchell, a businessman involved in a separate business legal suit against RBS, said he had met funders in the Lanesborough Hotel in London on Monday evening in an attempt to secure the millions of pounds needed to keep the case alive. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s really odd, why have the group accepted?\u201d</p> <p>New funding is needed after Trevor Hemmings, the football club owner and businessman who had previously been funding the case, accepted the offer.</p> <p>Goodwin has kept a low profile since leaving RBS at the time of its taxpayer bailout in October 2008. His last public appearance was before the Treasury select committee in February 2009. At the time <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/10/bankers-apologise-to-mps\">he had offered the MPs</a> his \u201cprofound and unqualified apology for all of the distress that has been caused\u201d.

      "bodyText": "British Airways has ordered an independent investigation into the systems meltdown that left 75,000 passengers stranded over the bank holiday weekend. The actions of a technician who switched off and then reconnected the power supply to BA\u2019s data centre are expected to form the centre of the inquiry, which will be carried out by an as-yet-unnamed external company. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of the airline\u2019s parent company, IAG, said the technician responsible was \u201cauthorised to be in the room, but wasn\u2019t authorised to do what he did\u201d. He added: \u201cYou could cause a mistake to disconnect the power \u2013 it\u2019s difficult for me to understand how you can mistakenly reconnect the power.\u201d The power was restored to the data centre in \u201can uncontrolled and uncommanded fashion that caused physical damage to the servers and distribution panels\u201d, Walsh said. If that had not been the case BA could have quickly recovered from the power outage, Walsh claimed. \u201cThat in itself was a problem that we could have overcome probably in a couple of hours, I don\u2019t think it would have led to any cancellations.\u201d Walsh said BA\u2019s communications had been poor after the incident, in which thousands of passengers were stranded at Heathrow before having to queue to leave the airport. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t suggest for one minute we got communications right at BA \u2013 we didn\u2019t.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s damaged us, but it hasn\u2019t destroyed us in any way. We\u2019ve recovered from worse. The BA brand is incredibly resilient.\u201d Speaking at the International Air Transport Associationglobal summit in Mexico, Walsh said of the fiasco: \u201cIt\u2019s something I wouldn\u2019t wish on anybody or any airline, when you see the customers who have suffered. I\u2019m hoping people will be able to learn from the experience we\u2019ve had and we\u2019ll all be better as a result.\u201d But the IAG chief defended cost-cutting at the airline, which has been criticised by unions as well as some City analysts. Hundreds of IT staff have been made redundant, while the airline\u2019s mixed fleet cabin crew are going on strike again this month in a dispute over \u201cpoverty pay\u201d. Walsh said the system meltdown \u201cwas not a failure of IT\u201d and denied cost-cutting had become counterproductive. \u201cI don\u2019t believe so \u2013 in many cases I don\u2019t believe there is any correlation ... But without question if we had not embarked on an efficiency improvement programme we wouldn\u2019t be in business today,\u201d he said. BA has faced a barrage of criticism over the last week over customer service and compensation. The airline has also this year stopped offering free food and drink on short-haul flights, as well as squeezing in more seats on some planes. Walsh said it was a natural reaction to focus on negative changes, but added: \u201cIf you look at the advances in technology \u2013 trillions of dollars invested in new aircraft, lounges and equipment \u2013 there needs to be balance about the changes that are beneficial to business and consumers and those that are regarded as retrograde. We invest a lot of money in new aircraft, we\u2019ve got to fund that through profitability.\u201d BA\u2019s system meltdown came after other highly disruptive failures at airlines such as Delta. Alexandre de Juniac, director general of Iata, said that the aviation industry\u2019s problems had \u201cnothing to do with cost-cutting\u201d, but bigger and more complex IT systems. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle it works so well.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British households are cutting back as the Brexit effect on the pound continues to raise living costs, according to a clutch of reports that show shops, car dealerships and other consumer-facing businesses coming under pressure last month. Uncertainty about the outcome of Thursday\u2019s election was also cited as a factor as the reports showed a drop in retail sales, a slowdown for the vast services sector and a fall in new car sales last month. They provided the latest signs that while manufacturers have picked up steam in recent months, those firms that rely on household spending have struggled, boding ill for the UK economy\u2019s overall prospects this year. Figures from the British Retail Consortium released on Tuesday showed that after an Easter-related bounce in April sales fell again in May, by 0.4% on a like-for-like basis from a year earlier. Taking less volatile figures for the last three months together, food sales rose but non-food sales were down. \u201cAfter the surge in retail sales last month \u2013 the byproduct of this year\u2019s relatively late Easter \u2013 retailers have been brought back down to earth with a thump,\u201d said Paul Martin, UK head of retail at the BRC report\u2019s co-authors KPMG. \u201cThe impact of inflationary pressures on the nation\u2019s purse continues to play out in this month\u2019s figures, with shoppers evidently spending more on food and drink than on non-food purchases.\u201d The upward push on prices stems largely from the pound\u2019s sharp fall since last June\u2019s Brexit vote. That has made imports to the UK more expensive and along with higher oil prices has lifted inflation to its highest level in more than three years. Wages have failed to keep pace, leaving workers worse off in real terms. A closely watched survey released on Monday suggested those pressures were also hurting the services sector, which a wide range of businesses from banks to hotels. The sector momentum in May and grew at the slowest pace since February, according to the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI report, which gauges sentiment among some 650 firms. Managers cited a drop in demand on the back of squeezed household budgets and delayed decision making among some clients ahead of the election. The report\u2019s main activity index dropped to 53.8 in May from 55.8 in April. However, that was still well above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction. The poll, which excludes government services and retail but still covers half of the overall services sector, is used by investors and policymakers to help predict GDP growth. The compilers said that taken together with their relatively strong reports from the construction and manufacturing sectors last week, the services report still pointed to a rebound in growth for the UK following a very weak start to 2017, when GDP expanded just 0.2%. \u201cThe three PMI surveys are running at levels that are historically consistent with GDP growing at a robust 0.5% rate, albeit with the slowing in May posing some downside risks to the near-term outlook,\u201d said Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit. The survey suggested cost pressures eased off for services firms last month and they continued to hire new workers amid cautious optimism. However, many economists expect the UK will struggle to match its 2016 performance when it defied predictions of a post-referendum downturn and was instead one of the fastest-growing advanced economies in the world. Figures from the car industry added to signs of consumer caution. The number of new cars registered in May fell by 8.5% year on year to 186,265, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. It was the second month in a row that sales were down after a record March when there was a rush for new cars before tax changes on vehicle emissions. The SMMT suggested the looming election was prompting customers to hold off from buying new cars but that the market remained strong overall. Barclaycard was less upbeat about the outlook. Its latest figures showed consumer spending growth slowed to 2.8% year on year in May, the weakest for 10 months. The company, which processes nearly half of UK credit and debit card transactions, said shoppers cut their spending on goods such as food and clothes but still found money for experiences, such as cinema trips as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Alien: Covenant were released. Polling of 1,868 people conducted for Barclaycard by YouGov found 53% felt confident about their household finances, down from a high of 70% in March. A similar proportion, 52%, said they were \u201cfeeling the squeeze\u201d from inflation.",

The compilers said that taken together with their relatively strong reports from the construction and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/01/uk-manufacturing-in-healthy-shape-despite-election-uncertainty\">manufacturing sectors last week</a>, the services report still pointed to a rebound in growth for the UK following a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/25/uk-gdp-growth-inflation-ons-prices-brexit\"> very weak start to 2017</a>, when GDP expanded just 0.2%.</p> <p>\u201cThe three PMI surveys are running at levels that are historically consistent with GDP growing at a robust 0.5% rate, albeit with the slowing in May posing some downside risks to the near-term outlook,\u201d said Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit.<br></p> <p>The survey suggested cost pressures eased off for services firms last month and they continued to hire new workers amid cautious optimism. However, many economists expect the UK will struggle to match its 2016 performance when it defied predictions of a post-referendum downturn and was instead one of the fastest-growing advanced economies in the world.</p> <p>Figures from the car industry added to signs of consumer caution. The number of new cars registered in May fell by 8.5% year on year to 186,265, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. It was the second month in a row that sales were down after a record March when there was a rush for new cars before tax changes on vehicle emissions.</p> <p>The SMMT suggested the looming election was prompting customers to hold off from buying new cars but that the market remained strong overall.</p> <p>Barclaycard was less upbeat about the outlook. Its latest figures showed consumer spending growth slowed to 2.8% year on year in May, the weakest for 10 months. </p> <p>The company, which processes nearly half of UK credit and debit card transactions, said shoppers cut their spending on goods such as food and clothes but still found money for experiences, such as cinema trips as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Alien: Covenant were released.</p> <p>Polling of 1,868 people conducted for Barclaycard by YouGov found 53% felt confident about their household finances, down from a high of 70% in March. A similar proportion, 52%, said they were \u201cfeeling the squeeze\u201d from inflation.</p>",
