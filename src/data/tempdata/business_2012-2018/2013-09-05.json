      "bodyText": "Strong car sales and new data showing that the number of first-time buyers in Britain's housing market jumped by 45% in the year to July have reinforced the picture of an economy in the grip of a summer mini-boom. An analysis by LSL Property Services, which owns estate agencies including Your Move, suggests there were more than 26,000 first-time buyer transactions in July \u2013 a dramatic increase of 45% on the same month in 2012. David Newnes, director of LSL Property Services, said: \"Mortgages are much more affordable for first-time buyers compared to last year, which has opened the door to thousands of would-be buyers who were shut out of the market. Economic confidence is returning, nudging many more buyers in the direction of property, and nudging lenders to offer more loans to buyers with smaller deposits.\" Car sales have also been strong, echoing robust growth in high street sales. The number of new cars registered last month rose 10.9% to 65,937 compared with a year earlier, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). That marked the 18th successive monthly rise in new car sales and pushed year-to-date sales to 1.39m vehicles, 10.4% higher than a year ago. By the same point in 2007, before the financial crisis, 1.52m new cars had been sold. Private purchases were the biggest drivers of growth, but fleet and business purchases also rose in August. \"UK new car registrations have now risen consecutively for a year and a half. Private and fleet buyers are clearly capitalising on attractive deals and new technologies against a backdrop of increasing economic confidence,\" said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT. However, the strong data intensified the sell-off in the bond markets on Thursday, increasing the pressure on Bank of England governor Mark Carney's policy of \"forward guidance\". Carney, who was hand-picked by the chancellor, George Osborne, hoped to keep borrowing costs low across the economy by sending a clear signal that he would not raise interest rates until unemployment falls below 7%, which the Bank's nine-member monetary policy committee expects to take at least three years. But a batch of data suggesting the economy has started to recover have prompted investors to bet against the Bank, in the belief that Carney will be forced to raise rates before 2016. When the MPC opted not to deliver a fresh warning to the markets after its monthly rate-setting meeting on Thursday, the yield \u2013 effectively the interest rate \u2013 on 10-year government bonds, or gilts, surged through 3% for the first time since July 2011. Yields are now higher than in July this year, when the MPC released a statement within days of Carney's arrival saying that recent moves in financial markets had been \"unwarranted\". There are growing concerns that the continuing sell-off in bond markets is driving up long-term interest rates, which could threaten the recovery, since many loans \u2013 particularly to businesses \u2013 are priced according to bond yields rather than the Bank's base rate. \"Ever higher market interest rates challenge the Bank's assessment of the outlook. Either the MPC needs to confront these market moves by stating that rate expectations are unwarranted \u2013 and thus guide rates lower \u2013 or it needs to acknowledge that the improving fundamentals have changed the position vis-\u00e0-vis the July and August meetings,\" said Ross Walker, UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland. Howard Archer of consultancy IHS Global Insight said: \"The MPC is increasingly facing a real dilemma, resulting from the surprisingly strong growth that the economy is currently experiencing. While this robust growth is a hugely welcome development following the economy's prolonged struggles, it is making the markets even more sceptical that the Bank of England will not raise interest rates from 0.50% before mid-2016.\" Carney will appear before MPs on the Treasury select committee to explain the policy of forward guidance next Thursday. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, also left interest rates on hold yesterday, after the 18-member eurozone clambered out of recession in the second quarter of the year; but he admitted that the bank's governing council had considered a rate cut. At his press conference after the ECB's meeting, Draghi said: \"I am very, very cautious about the recovery, I can't share the enthusiasm. These shoots are still very, very green.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Europe will ban mobile phone networks from charging customers more to use their phones abroad, according a leaked draft of legislation which the European commission will publish next week. Neelie Kroes, the commission vice-president who speaks on digital affairs, is bent on ending the unpopular roaming fees, which have left many holidaymakers with huge bills on their return home. Her proposals have faced fierce opposition from the largest networks, including Vodafone, Orange and Telef\u00f3nica, which say the end of roaming within Europe could cost them \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.9bn). Networks will be left with little choice but to offer a flat rate to customers at home or abroad for calls, texts and internet connections across Europe, according to a draft document seen by the Guardian. This will be achieved using airline-style alliances in countries where operators do not own a network. The alliances will have to cover at least 85% of the European population and 21 member states. Kroes has described roaming charges as a \"cash cow\" for operators and \"a disproportionate irritant for travellers\". She aims to boost Europe's digital competitiveness with proposals for a single telecoms market which are scheduled to be endorsed by the commission on 11 September. Member states will meet next month to discuss the plan, which will also need approval by the European parliament. A recent draft of the 93-page document promises to \"guarantee common high levels of consumer protection across the union, including measures to gradually end mobile roaming surcharges\". As well as tackling call costs, the commission will use a swath of measures to create a single telecoms market, while stopping short of creating a single European telecoms regulator. There had been suggestions that powers could be taken away from national watchdogs such as Ofcom and handed to Brussels. Other new measures include open internet safeguards to stop broadband companies blocking legal but competing websites and services such as Skype, and plans to harmonise mobile spectrum sales across the region. This is intended to avoid a repeat of the piecemeal 4G allocation. The commission began forcing operators to cut roaming costs last year. Many charge customers extra even when they are using a local network owned by the same company as their domestic network. While Europeans cannot unknowingly run up a bill larger than \u20ac50 (\u00a342) while abroad, roaming charges are still many times higher than domestic call costs and will remain so without further legislation. Kroes is proposing that companies which phase out roaming from July 2014 will face lighter-touch regulation. For example, they will not be forced to offer customers a choice of providers for foreign calls. From 2014, customers would be able to keep costs down by selecting another provider for calls, texts and internet data services while travelling, if their own network charges extra for service abroad. They could do this without having to change their phone number or buy a new sim card. The draft rules state: \"When parties to collective roaming agreements offer to all their customers by default roaming tariffs at the level of domestic tariffs, the obligation of domestic providers to enable their customers to access voice, SMS and data roaming services of any alternative roaming provider should not apply.\" In the past, price caps have been used to bring down the coast of calling abroad. The last of these come into force in 2014, and after fierce resistance from the larger operators, Kroes is not proposing any more price reductions. Instead, she is hoping to force change by using incentives. A spokesman for Kroes said: \"We don't give a running commentary on the proposals but we are committed to putting in place a method that pushes roaming out of the market.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The head of the European Central Bank has ruled out handing Greece a debt relief lifeline, hours after the head of the eurozone finance ministers admitted that Athens will need additional aid next year. ECB president Mario Draghi was adamant that the ECB would not participate in any debt restructuring, despite growing speculation that Greece will be unable to fully return to the financial markets when its current bailout ends in 2014. \"It is pretty clear that we cannot do monetary financing,\" Draghi told reporters in Frankfurt on Thursday, insisting that the ECB's own treaty made it impossible. Asked directly if the ECB would take part in any Greek debt relief, he said: \"No\", adding that any future assistance for Greece must also come with strings attached, or \"conditionality\". Greece faces a funding gap of up to \u20ac11bn in the second half of 2014, according to figures from the International Monetary Fund. Rumours that a third bailout will be needed have swirled through the financial markets in recent weeks. Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who also chairs the eurogroup of finance ministers, left MEPs in little doubt that euro governments will have to consider some extra help for Greece soon. Appearing at the European parliament, Dijsselbloem said it was \"realistic to assume that additional support will be needed\" when the existing bailout concludes at the end of next year. \"As far as the potential need for a third programme for Greece is concerned, it's clear that despite recent progress, Greece's troubles will not have been completely resolved by 2014,\" said Dijsselbloem, who warned that Greece would probably not be able to return to borrowing from the financial markets when its bailout ends. Dijsselbloem said the Eurogroup \"stood ready\" to help Greece, while rejecting suggestions that a full-blown third bailout package would be needed. He argued that officials would not be able to assess Greece's progress until next April. But according to Reuters, Euro officials may need to take a decision this November. Last week, Greece's finance minister Yannis Stournaras told the Guardian there was no imminent need of a bailout. But while tourism has picked up this summer, unemployment remains around record levels. It will not return to pre-crisis levels for 20 years, according to new research from the country's main private sector union, GSEE. The euro fell almost one cent against the US dollar, after it emerged that the ECB's governing council had considered cutting borrowing costs across the eurozone to a new record low. The ECB cut its forecast for growth in 2014 to 1%, from 1.1%, illustrating the weak nature of the recovery. Draghi warned that he was \"very, very cautious\", despite the eurozone exiting recession last month. Jessica Hinds of Capital Economics was gloomy. \"Despite the string of better economic numbers over the summer in the eurozone, we still expect the region to underperform the US and the UK. Indeed, we do not forecast the eurozone to grow at all next year, much less than the 0.8% growth that is expected by the consensus and the 1.0% by the ECB. By contrast, we are forecasting the UK to grow by 2% in 2014 and the US economy to expand by 2.5%.\" Analysts at Nordea Markets predicted that the ECB could cut interest rates from 0.5% to a new record low of 0.25% before the end of the year, having voted to leave them unchanged this month.",

      "bodyText": "Over in Cyprus, several hundred protesters gathered outside the parliament in Nicosia this evening to protest against its austerity programme, warning that it is driving more people into poverty. AP has more details: Demonstrators from communist party AKEL and other left-wing groups shouted slogans and held aloft banners criticizing the country's financial rescue plan. One banner read \"We won't become 21st century slaves.\" Lawmakers are voting [next] Tuesday on laws and reforms demanded by the country's euro area partners and the International Monetary Fund in return for a second, 1.5 billion ($1.98 billion) euro installment from a 10 billion euro loan. As part of its rescue, Cyprus in March agreed on a deal that saw deposits over 100,000 euros in its two biggest banks take major losses. Restrictions on withdrawals and transfers from banks were also imposed to prevent a run. And on that note, I'm shutting up for the night. Back tomorrow. Goodnight! GW Five years ago today, the world economy was in a terrible mess...and the England football team wasn't much better. So tweets Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, who reminds us that the Japanese Nikkei tanked, the US non-farm payroll showed heavy job losses, and England's finest laboured to beat the might of Andorra Football will do that to a man... European stock markets finished higher tonight, as traders waited for the big news tomorrow \u2013 the US jobs data: Analysts at Nordea Markets also believe the ECB could cut rates again this year, saying: ECB President Draghi\u2019s introductory statement by and large confirmed our view that the ECB has a clear easing bias despite recent better-than-expected key figures. Here's their analysis of the ECB's press conference. The euro has fallen almost one cent against the US dollar this afternoon, following Mario Draghi's dovish comments and the disclosure that the ECB discussed an interest rate cut. \u20ac1 is trading around $1.314, from $1.3207 last night. JP Morgan has added up all this week's PMI survey data, and reports that the world's private sector grew at its fastest pace in two and a half years. And the UK lead the way: Heads-up: MPs will get their teeth into Mark Carney and his 'forward guidance' in a weeks time. Carney is scheduled to appear in front of the Treasury committee at 10am next Thursday to discuss last month's quarterly inflation report, along with three colleagues. From the press notice: Monetary Policy Committee August 2013 Inflation Report Date/time: Thursday 12 September, at 10.00am Location: Thatcher Room, Portcullis House, House of Commons Witnesses: \u00b7 Dr Mark Carney, Governor; \u00b7 Paul Fisher, Executive Director, Markets; \u00b7 Professor David Miles Member; and \u00b7 Ian McCafferty, Member, Monetary Policy Committee, Bank of England. Here's a summary of the key points from the European Central Bank press conference this afternoon. \u2022 The ECB governing council considered cutting interest rates, before voting to leave them unchanged today. Mario Draghi hinted at tension, saying some governors argued that a rate cut was unwarranted, but others insisted the recovery was \"too green\". \u2022 The ECB reiterated its forward guidance on interest rates. For the third month running, the governing council said it would maintain rates at their current level, or lower, for an extended period of time. \u2022 The ECB has revised its economic forecasts. It now expects GDP to shrink by only 0.4% this year, not 0.6%. However it also only expects growth of 1% in 2014, not 1.1%. Inflation is also expected to be a little higher than previously thought, at 1.5% (from 1.4%). \u2022 Draghi remained cautious about the state of the Eurozone economy, even though the recession is over. \"Risks are to the downside,\" he warned. \u2022 Draghi dismissed the suggestion that the ECB might grant debt relief for Greece. Such monetary financing is out of the question he said. And if any further aid is offered to Athens, there must be strings attached. \u2022 The ECB is watching events in Syria closely for signs of geopolitical risks to the recovery. It has not discussed the situation directly with the Federal Reserve yet, though. America's service sector raced ahead in August, according to data released this afternoon. The Institute for Supply Management's monthly index of service sector activity hit its highest level since December 2005, jumping to 58.6 last month from 56 in July (anything about 50 shows expansion). Paul Dales of Capital Economics said it showed the US recovery was \"gathering a real head of steam\", following strong data earlier this week. When taken with the rise in the ISM manufacturing index (which was released on Tuesday), it points to an acceleration in annualised GDP growth in the third quarter to around 4.0%, from the second quarter\u2019s 2.5%. We don\u2019t think growth will be quite that good, but demand appears to be strengthening. The yield on Britain's 10-year bonds has just risen through the 3% mark, for the first time since July 2011. That shows that the City is not convinced by Mark Carney's forward guidance, that interest rates will remain at record lows until 2016. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says that Draghi's dovish comments today bolster his theory that eurozone rates will be cut before the end of the year. We maintain the view that there is a very real chance that the ECB will eventually take its key policy rate down from 0.50% to 0.25% during the fourth quarter. The ECB could very well be prompted into action to counter a further rise in Eurozone market rates, particularly if they spike up when the US Federal Reserve starts to taper. The ECB could also eventually cut interest rates if Eurozone recovery stalls over the coming months or even if it fails to gather significant momentum, which is very possible. Likely ongoing muted inflationary pressures will give the ECB ample room to act if need be. The press conference finishes with a classic Draghi moment. The ECB president is asked about the OMT programme (its promise to buy unlimited amounts of government bonds if a country hits trouble). Why has it been so successful, given it's not been activated? Draghi, who invented OMT, replies that \"it is very hard to answer that question without flattering oneself\". So he answers it anyway. The brilliant bit about OMT, he says, is that its design makes it \"both powerful and credible\". The power comes from the pledge to buy as many bonds as needed to drive down a country's borrowing costs. The credibility lies in the ECB's insistence that a nation must accept conditionality (targets or policies agreed with the ECB) in return. And fair play to Draghi, the plan has worked. Italy - deep in recession and gripped by an ongoing political crisis - can borrow at 4.5% for 10 years. Steen and Draghi then have an invigorating discussion about the nitty-gritty of forward guidance. Should the ECB more more explicit about its guidance? And would it would approach the challenge differently if it had NOT promised to keep rates low for an extended period? Draghi says that forward guidance is not a change of policy so much as an explanation of it (thus giving more welly to the policy stance) Draghi also argues that the ECB's main goal is to make clear that it has a 'downward bias' to rates, without having to commit itself, Federal-Reserve-style, to a stimulus programme. The ECB has a narrower mandate, he explains - price stability is the primary goal. Would Draghi like to give his opinion of the Italian economy, given he had no hesitation in giving a critique of the Netherlands, asks the FT's Michael Steen. Draghi (a one-time head of the Italian central bank) would not. Shame Is there a plan for co-ordinated action between the world's central banks if the Middle Eastern crisis escalates? Draghi says that \"we are certainly alert\" to the geopolitical risks that could come from the Syrian crisis. There's been no direct discussion with the Federal Reserve, though. He adds that the ECB is certainly aware of the potential risks to emerging markets, and he also says he remains \"very, very cautious\" about the economic situation. As a big holder of Greek bonds, would the ECB support a further cut in Greece's debt pile? No, says Draghi. We've been over this in the past. We will not participate in any Greek rebt relief, and we're not even allowed to do monetary financing. Will the ECB give Ireland a precautionary credit line to help it return to the financial markets, when its bailout finishes at the end of 2013? Draghi says that Ireland appears to be on track, with positive fiscal developments, and \"improving market sentiment\". Challenges remain, though, he adds. It's up to the eurogroup to decide what's needed - and ideally in the next couple of months.... Draghi is asked about whether Greece will need a third aid programme (something Jeroen Dijsselbloem talked about this morning). He replies that there's no immediate rush, as the Greek programme runs until the end of 2014. That gives time for the Eurogroup to assess the situation, and decide whether to extend the programme. He adds: If an extension of the programme is needed, it will require further conditionality. Ie, further aid would come with strings attached. Asked about the slow push towards banking union, Draghi tells journalists to expect \"good news\" on the creation of a Single Supervisory Mechanism in the coming days. He adde that there will also be \"a full communication on the [bank] asset quality review\" by the middle of next month. A Dutch journalist says that the Netherlands blames austerity measures and too-tight monetary policy for driving it into recession. Draghi replies that the Netherlands is enduring a \"protracted domestic demand-driven recession\". So don't blame me? Draghi is then quizzed about the current money market levels , where a eurozone rate rise is being priced in earlier than the ECB has indicated. Is this unwarranted? Draghi says forward guidance is means to avoid 'overreaction' to decent economic growth - and it's been \"moderately successful\" he says. Very interesting to hear Draghi talk about the argument within the governing council (heck, everyone knows they're there, but still.....). Perhaps he's inching us towards a new world where the ECB releases minutes of its meeting (something that's being considered). Next question -- did the ECB governing council consider cutting rates? Draghi indicates that they did, replying: On a interest rate cut, there was a discussion as there is all the time...on monetary policy instruments. Some governors, he reveals, felt recent strength of the economy made this discussion inappropriate. But \"several other governors\" argued that the recovery is \"too green\", suggesting they did want another rate cut. Presumably Germany's Jens Weidmann led the first camp - and those from the eurozone periphery argued for a cut. First question -- is the ECB planning to rein in any of the liquidity sloshing around in the eurozone system (Draghi's statement included a reference to this), and is it worried about the events in the Middle East? Could an oil price shock drive inflation up. Draghi says liquidity is a key issue for the ECB - it's watching the situation and is prepared to act. But while the eurozone financial system is still fragmented, it will leave things as they are. On Syria, Draghi says \"we'll have to see\" how the situation develops. Draghi's opening statement is now online here. Right, onto the good bit -- the questions from the press pack..... We need to finalise banking union, says Draghi, pointing out that \"weak loan dynamics continue to reflect the current state of the business cycle\". The ECB has also revised its inflation forecast - it now expects it to rise by 1.5% this year, slightly higher than the 1.4% estimate announced in June. The forecast for 2014 is unchanged, at 1.3%. Draghi says the ECB has revised up its forecast for GDP growth in 2013, by 0.2 percentage points. That means a contraction of 0.4%, rather than 0.6%, I think. However it has cut its forecast for 2014, by 0.1 percentage points. That cuts it to 1%, from 1.1%, I think. Draghi warns: Risks remain to the downside. Unemployment in the euro area remains high, says Draghi. A record high of 12.1%, indeed Draghi turns to economic forecasts, saying that the ECB expects output will recover at a \"slow pace\", with exports helpin the eurozone economy to recover from its recession. early reaction: Draghi reiterates the ECB's forward guidance on interest rates. As first announced two months ago, Draghi sayd that the governing council expects interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels for an extended period. Mario Draghi has begun his press conference in Frankfurt, telling the press pack that economic data over the last month has reinforced the ECB's view of the eurozone economy. Inflation expectations continue to be \"firmly anchored\", he says. The ECB's straegy is geared towards maintaining a degree of monetary accomodation, says Draghi, adding that the monetary policy stance will remain accomodative for \"as long as necessary\". Over in the UK -- the weekly jobs data shows a 9,000 drop in the 'new claimant count' last week, to 323,000. The European Central Bank press conference is about to start -- it's streamed live on the ECB website, and on Bloomberg TV. George Osborne is planning to talk up the UK economy during his time at the G20. From St Petersburg, our political editor Patrick Wintour writes: George Osborne is due to tell G20 leaders that the recovering UK economy may move Britain from the slow lane of ailing European economies to being ranked alongside the US, in terms of performance. But he accepted there was a long way to go before the recovery could be bedded in and warned that external events such as shocks in the emerging markets could still see progress held back. More here: G20 summit: Osborne to hail Britain's accelerating economy Here's a snap of the British contingent arriving at the G20 Summit in St Petersburg. Mark Carney (sandwiched between David Cameron and George Osborne) looks pretty cheerful, for a man facing down the market over his monetary policy. Here's Reuters first take: The European Central Bank left its main interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.50% on Thursday, as recent economic data has shown a nascent recovery taking hold in the euro zone. Strong orders for manufactured goods helped factory activity in the currency bloc rise at the fastest pace in over two years in August and led to backlogs of work for the first time since mid-2011, a survey showed on Monday. Euro zone inflation is expected to slow to 1.3 percent in August from 1.6 percent in the previous month, EU statistics office Eurostat said last week. The ECB's goal is just below 2%, though it looks at prices over the medium term. The ECB also left the rate on its deposit facility at 0.0% and held its marginal lending facility - or emergency borrowing rate - at 1.00%. The markets now turn their attention to ECB President Mario Draghi's news conference, scheduled to begin at 1230 GMT, where he will be asked about the central bank's future plans. No shock in the City, where traders had expected the ECB to leave the monetary policy controls alone this month. Europe's economy is officially growing, so a rate cut isn't really justified. But the recovery is so fragile that any rate rise now could easily crush it. And here's the official statement from the ECB Breaking: The ECB has followed the Bank of England by leaving monetary policy unchanged. The European Central Bank's governing council has voted to leave the headline interest rate unchanged at 0.5%. It also left its marginal lending facility at 1% (this is what it charges commercial banks who borrow from it). And the ECB's deposit facility will remain at 0.00% -- meaning banks will not receive any interest for stashing excessive cash in the central bank vaults. Next up - the European Central Bank's decision on monetary policy in 10 minutes. Then the monthly press conference, at 1.30pm BST (2.30pm Frankfurt time). \u201cThe disconnect between recent economic strength in the UK and monetary policy, in particular the forward guidance thereof, has never been so clear-cut,\" says Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the foreign exchange company, World First. Mark Carney's forward guidance is that that interest rates won't rise until the unemployment rate drops to 7% from 7.8%. So despite Britain's firms reporting that activity is rising sharply, rates are going to stay low for some time... Cook has some advice for the new(ish) governor: Speed of a recovery is one thing, durability is quite another, and Carney maybe should be focusing on \u2018Exit Strength\u2019 more than \u2018Exit Velocity\u2019. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, says the Bank of England made the right decision. He fears that the Bank could shoot itself in the foot if it announced a further bout of money-printing though quantitative easing: Any increase in QE at a time when the US considers withdrawing its stimuluscould lead to a sharp fall in sterling and higher inflation, providing little benefit to exporters. He'd like to see the BoE buy private assets such as \"securised SME loans\" (ie, a bundle of loans made to small firms), to push down borrowing costs, rather than yet more gilts. Glenn Uniacke, senior dealer at Moneycorp, says the Bank of England's decision is \"at odds with the stellar UK economic data\" of recent weeks (private sector output up, GDP growth up, house prices up). Should the economy continue to perform so well, Carney will find it difficult to continue to talk down the expectations of UK growth, and along with it the Pound. The Bank of England\u2019s aim to keep long-term borrowing rates as low as possible may have to be tempered by the realities of a strong UK recovery evidenced by August\u2019s PMI figures. The pound has risen around 0.2% today, at $1.565 against the US dollar. The news that the Bank of England didn't change monetary policy, or issue a statement has weakened UK government debt a little. The yield on its 10-year gilts is now up to 2.935%, from 2.87% overnight. It's the highest level since July 2011, when Britain's 10-year borrowing costs fell below 3% as the eurozone crisis escalated. No statement from the Bank of England either. #disappointing Breaking: The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates at their current record low of 0.5%. There's also no change to its quantitative easing progamme, which remains at \u00a3375bn. Barroso tells St Petersburg that the euro will remain a stable and strong currency, but that it's 'premature' to declare the European economic crisis over. Back in St Petersburg, European Counncil president Herman Van Rompuy is also preaching the message that Europe is on the mend: The yield on Germany's 10-year bonds just hit 2%, for the first time in around 18 months. Hardly a crisis. Indeed, it looks like another sign of normality returning to the markets. Barroso says the European Union has four priorities for the G20 meeting: 1) Leaders must keep working to inject fresh dynamics in the global economy 2) To continue closer regulation of the financial markets 3) Summit will complete the 'paradigm' shift in taxation -- bringing in more fairness to the taxation system, and stopping multinational firms hiding profits 4) Fighting trade protectionism European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso begins the G20 press conference in St Petersburg by declaring that Europe's message is that \"the recovery will continue\", and that the European economy has turned the corner. On the G20, and taxation, we're hoping that leaders will promise to develop powerful tools to battle international tax evaders by next summer. My colleague Simon Bowers writes in today's paper: The move at the meeting, being held in St Petersburg, Russia, will be claimed as a victory for an aggressive new strategy in the battle against evasion. The plan is to unilaterally demand that financial institutions automatically surrender information on customer assets to overseas tax authorities. This bold approach has been pioneered by the US and has attracted accusations from tax havens of human rights abuses and economic imperialism. But the G20 nations will all sign up to the measures. The plan is to be drafted by the OECD, and borrows heavily from the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act drawn up in the US. G20 summit: states chase tax evaders with plan to swap data globally Bank of England governor Mark Carney didn't hang around in London to see the reaction to this month's interest rate decision (due at noon BST). He's just arrived in St Petersburg Moscow alongside prime minister David Cameron and chancellor George Osborne. July wasn't a blowout month for German industry, it appear. New data shows factory orders fell by 2.7% - more than the 1% economists had pencilled in. Export orders shrank by 4.5%. Not great, but not a big surprise either -- June's figures were extremely strong due to orders for new aircraft, around the Paris Air Show. Never good to miss expectations, though... One for numismatists among you, the Royal Mint has launched Britain's first \u00a320 coin today. Called The George and the Dragon 2013 UK \u00a320 Fine Silver Coin, just 250,000 have been struck, and are on sale for exactly \u00a320 each. Shane Bissett, director of commemorative coins at the Royal Mint, calls it \"a beautiful work of art and at a price more people can afford\". See what you think: The coins are officially legal tender (but banks aren't obliged to accept them, and you'll struggle to buy a round of drinks with one), but they're mainly aimed at the collectors' market. It's certainly not the best way to buy precious metals, of course. The coin weighs 15.71g. Silver is changing hands at $23.45 per ounce (28 gram) this morning, so by my back-of-the-envelope calculations there's around $13 (\u00a38 or so) of actual silver in 'em. Nice work if you can get it... Jonathan Pryor, head of foreign exchanger trading at Investec Corporate Treasury, reckons the Bank of England may release a statement at noon , to drive home its \"forward guidance\" that borrowing costs won't rise soon. The Bank of England may provide additional rhetoric to strengthen their position on forward guidance. At present markets are pricing in interest hikes in two years\u2019 time or so while Carney and the Bank of England are insistent that this will not happen until 2016. Pryor also predicts that the ECB's Mario Draghi will take a dovish tone, despite the eurozone recession ending last month: With the peripheral economies still struggling from weak credit growth and persistent disinflationary conditions Draghi will be keen to keep a lid on rising sovereign bond yields. UK government bonds are weakening ahead of the Bank of England's interest rate decision, due in almost two hours. The yield on five-year gilts has hit a two-year high this morning. Reuters has the details: Five-year gilt yields rose 6 basis points on the day to hit a peak of 1.709% at 08.07 GMT, their highest level since July 2011 - potentially pushing up short-term borrowing costs that the Bank of England wants to keep in check. Spain conducted a successful bond auction this morning, selling debt at the cheapest rates since 2010. The Spanish Treasury raised \u20ac4bn in five and 10-year bonds, with buyers agreeing to lower yields (the interest rate on the debt) than at earlier auctions this year. At 4.503%, the yields on its 10-year bonds were the lowest in three years. A sign of further confidence that the eurozone is recovering. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has promised to help Ireland return to the financial markets as its bailout plan ends. He told MEPs that there will be \"assistance for Ireland as it gradually exits its [bailout] programme\"... \"measure to support its gradual exit\". No further details, though, but the focus will to keep the Irish government away from a second rescue package. As Dijsselbloem put it: [It will be] support to ensure it is a good exit, not a temporary exit. Back to Jeroen Dijsselbloem's testimony in Brussels, and the eurogroup president says the eurozone exit from recession is due to deficit reduction measures, structural reforms and the measures taken by the European Central Bank. Dijsselbloem said that Europe now needs to keep cutting deficits, and implement banking union. Politically, we need to deliver what we've promised. UK car sales surged last month, in the latest signal that the British economic recovery is gathering pace. The Society of Motor Manufacturers reports that sales rose by 10.9% in August compared with a year ago, which is the 18th monthly rise in a row. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight calls it \"yet more good news on the UK economy\", in contrast to Europe (where sales have fallen through the year): Private new car sales are particularly healthy fuelled by markedly improved consumer confidence and record high employment, and benefiting from attractive offers and packages, as well as by motorists\u2019 desire to buy more fuel efficient cars at a time of high petrol prices Matina Stevis of the WSJ reads between the lines of Dijsselbloem's comments about Greece needing further assistance (8.59am onwards). Jeroen Dijsselbloem's comments about further help for Greece is sewing some confusion among the eurocrisis experts: An MEP asks Jeroen Dijsselbloem if Greece would have to agree to new austerity measures or reforms in return for new help. Dijsselbloem replies that it's \"much to early to talk about a new programme, the size of a new programme, or the conditions of a new programme,\" adding: The only thing I've made clear is that it's very likely that at the end of its programme...the problems of Greece will not be fully solved... and it will not have fully returned to the financial markets. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem has told MEP that it is \"realistic\" to assume that Greece will need further asssistance in 2014. Testifying at the European parliament in Brussels, Dijsselbloem told the economic and monetary afairs committe that Greece's problems will not be solved by next year, despite recent progress. As Dijsselbloem put it: \"Regarding the possible need for a third program for Greece, it is clear that despite recent progress, the problems in Greece will not be fully resolved by 2014. It is realistic to assume that additional support will be needed beyond the program. Against this background, the Eurogroup has clearly indicated that he was determined to provide appropriate support to Greece during the current program and in-beyond, until she regained access to the market. The hearing is being streamed here. Dijsselbloem insisted, though, that this is 'non-news', as the Eurogroup has always said \"it stands ready, etc etc\" (as he put it) to help Greece. And as flagged up at 8.23am, Dijsselbloem also told the committee on Economic and monetary affairs that it's not helpful to speculate about how much assistance will be needed. We just won't know the situation until next spring. Little let-up in France's unemployment misery, with new data this morning showing that the jobless rate rose again in the second quarter of 2013, to 10.9%. The rate within mainland France (excluding overseas territories) also rose, from 10.4% to 10.5%. The youth unemployment rate fell, though, by 0.3 percentage points to 24.6%. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, Dutch finance minister and head of the Eurogroup, is testifying at the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Live stream here. Tuning in now,... he just told MEPs that \"speculation at this stage\" over future assistance for Greece is \"not helpful\". The Eurogroup won't be able to assess Athen's performance against its bailout targets until at least April 2014. Mark Carney and Mario Draghi are battling quite different problems, points out Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: Bank of England governor Carney has had the decidedly good fortune to take over the UK central bank at precisely the time that the UK economy appears to be building up a head of steam... Which means the markets don't believe his pledge to leave rates unchanged for three more years. ...Over in Europe, Draghi has a completely different problem, namely a basket case of an economy that appears to be coming out of intensive care, whose economic heart in the form of Germany is starting to beat again, but whose limbs in the form of the peripheral countries are starting to see some blood flow into them, but not anywhere near enough to suggest that they can start moving with any degree of independence. Hewson predicts that we might get a statement from the Bank of England at noon, and that the ECB could tweak its growth forecasts. The Bank of Japan declared this morning that the Japanese economy is recovering, as it announced its monthly policy decision. The BoJ stated that \"Japan's economy is recovering moderately,\" which is more bullish than August's statement that the economy was \"starting to recover moderately.\" It also voted to maintain its current massive stimulus programme, swelling the money supply by at least 60 trillion yen (\u00a3385bn) per year. Reuters has more details: A slew of positive data has underscored the view that robust household spending and the feel-good mood generated by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's pro-growth policies are gradually prompting companies to increase capital spending and hiring. The BOJ's upgraded view may heighten the case for Abe to go ahead with a planned sales tax hike from next year, a move seen as necessary to start reining in Japan's huge public debt. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the global economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. It's a big day for central banks, with monthly monetary policy decisions from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank coming up in the next few hours. Despite signs of economic revival in Britain and Europe, both banks are expected to keep their pledges to leave interest rates at their current record lows until the recovery is secured. The key event will probably be ECB president Mario Draghi's press conference at 1.30pm BST. The man who calmed the eurozone crisis with his pledge to do 'whatever it takes' will take questions on monetary policy, the state of the European economy, and more. Yesterday's strong UK service sector data put more pressure on the Bank of England over its controversial pledge to keep interest rates at 0.5% until 2016. With Britain's private sector posting its highest jump in activity since at least 1998, surely borrowing costs (and savings rates) will rise before then?..... And with governor Mark Carney at the helm of the Bank of England, there's always the chance of a 'surprise statement' being issued at noon today. The Bank of Japan has already got the ball rolling with its own meeting, where it maintained their stimulus programme -- and declared that the Japanese economy is improving (more to follow). Unusually, the Bank of England actually took its decision yesterday, so that Carney could head over to Moscow for the start of the G20 summit. The G20 gathering will be dominated by Syria, but I'll be watching for any important economic news - along with other developments through the day....",

Inflation is also expected to be a little higher than previously thought, at 1.5% (from 1.4%).</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Draghi remained cautious about the state of the Eurozone economy, even though the recession is over.</strong> \"Risks are to the downside,\" he warned.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Draghi dismissed the suggestion that the ECB might grant debt relief for Greece</strong>. Such monetary financing is out of the question he said.

    "webTitle": "UK investors see bright future for solar power \u2013 if the nimbys can be won over", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The late summer sun is shining on Britain's solar power sector with new investments worth almost \u00a3220m unveiled on Thursday by City-based groups. A new solar fund created by asset manager Foresight is planning to raise \u00a3200m to buy eight solar farms across the UK through a flotation on the London stock exchange. In a separate move, Bluefield Partners, which attracted \u00a3130m earlier this year for its Solar Income Fund, said it would spend \u00a317m buying a large-scale solar plant in Norfolk from the pioneering developer Solarcentury. The new investor interest in low-carbon power is not restricted to solar, with \u00a3300m being raised for wind and solar farms by the Renewables Infrastructure Group and a further \u00a3260m by Greencoat UK for wind projects. RenewablesUK, which lobbies on behalf of green energy, described the newfound City interest as \"the best possible kind of endorsement\" for a sector that has been hit hard hit by recession. Solar power has been slow to take off in Britain compared with some other European countries such as Germany. But public subsidies and falling equipment costs are combining to make it more attractive. There is a little over 2.5GW of solar power in place in Britain. The Department of Energy and Climate Change, however, expects this to increase to 3GW by next year. \"The government would like to see 20GW in place by 2020 and from what we see the investor appetite is there, and as for availability of projects: absolutely,\" said Jamie Richards, a partner at Foresight. The asset manager says it has binding commitments in place to acquire eight solar parks amounting to 145.5MW \u2013 two of them very large at more than 30MW each \u2013 all of which either are working or have planning consent. And if the \u00a3200m is raised from institutional and retail investors it will be added to \u00a3450m already invested in a variety of solar projects both in Britain and on the continent. The Foresight Solar Investment Fund is promising to pay an initial 6p dividend on each 100p of ordinary shares on the back of the income stream from the solar farms, which are eligible for the government's renewable obligation certificates. Bluefield and Solarcentury expect to have their 14.8MW solar farm project on an agricultural site near Hadingham ready to generate electricity in December. One of the changes that has spurred the sector has been the government decision to lift a 5MW cap on the size of projects eligible for subsidies via the feed-in tariff. The arrival in recent years of low-cost solar panels from China \u2013 now subject to challenge by European manufacturers \u2013 has also helped make photovoltaic technology more competitive. But there are also clouds on the horizon, with fears mounting that a move to anything close to the 20GW aspiration would mean coating vast swaths of the British countryside in panels and raising the kind of popular opposition seen in the onshore wind power sector. A planning application for a \u00a320m solar farm on a 38-hectare (94-acre) site in Tattingstone, Suffolk, was turned down in June following a high-profile campaign by local opponents including the actor and comedian Griff Rhys Jones. There has been particular unease about new projects in Cornwall and the rest of the south-west. In August, Somerset MP and foreign minister Jeremy Browne described large-scale solar farms as a \"monstrous desecration\" of the countryside after plans for a 20-hectare site near Taunton were unveiled. Richards said he was aware of these negative developments but added that his investors were shielded by the fact that the new fund was investing only in existing schemes or those already with planning consent. RenewablesUK said it was particularly pleased to see the sudden rush of investor money into low-carbon power given that the new energy bill was still wending its way through parliament. \"This is all very useful as it creates a real sense of momentum,\" said Rob Norris, a RenewablesUK spokesman. \"Other people [City investors] wanting a slice of the action is very good to see. These are people who crunch the numbers really hard so it's the best possible kind of endorsement.\" The solar and better-established wind power industries have both struggled from the reduction in subsidy levels and what critics have claimed is an inconsistent message of support from the coalition government. Many leading Conservatives, including the chancellor, George Osborne, have made clear their growing concerns about the costs of supporting renewables. Green energy enthusiasts are worried that some ministers seem more supportive of new shale gas schemes, but today the City seems keen to soak up the solar rays. Targets Solar was never expected to make a big contribution to the UK's 2020 power needs. The 2011 Renewable Energy Roadmap examined how to hit a target of 15% of demand being met by green energy. Of expected demand of 234 terrawatt hours (TWh), onshore wind would be 24-32 TWh and offshore 33-58 with biomass electricity providing 32-50TWh and biomass heat 36-50. Solar (lumped with hydro and geothermal) was expected to provide 14 TWh . But hopes for solar have grown while expectations for onshore wind and biomass have fallen.",

      "bodyText": "Traders and shoppers in Sherborne, Dorset, have been celebrating with champagne and cakes \u2013 supplied by the independent wine shop and the neighbourhood delicatessen \u2013 following Tesco's decision not to open a store in the town. Supporters of Sherborne's vibrant high street collected the signatures of 11,000 people \u2013 more than the town's population \u2013 who said they opposed the proposed opening. They ran an imaginative campaign, even boarding up some storefronts for a day to give an impression of what they feared the town could become if the supermarket giant moved in. They enlisted celebrities including the former children's television presenter Valerie Singleton, who lives locally, to help with their No Thanks Tesco campaign. \"It's an amazing result,\" said Hannah Wilkins, of the Vineyards wine shop, who took part in the campaign. \"I think Tesco have seen sense.

David Brown, chief executive of Go-Ahead, said the group was meanwhile making progress towards its target of \u00a3100m in annual profits from its combined bus divisions. Go-Ahead reported overall pre-tax profits of \u00a386.2 for 2012-13, down 8% on last year. Profit in its rail division fell by \u00a315.7m as premium payments to the Treasury grew by \u00a385.9m across its three franchises \u2013 Southern, Southeastern and London Midland. Brown said it showed that private operators were not making vast profits from rail. \"We're a net contributor to the goverment. Our rail profits are only 1.3%.\" Brown said the group's results were slightly ahead of board expectations, and progressing well on the back of good passenger growth. He said the majority of growth would be on deregulated services outside London, where a push on mobile ticketing and smart cards would push up passenger numbers and revenue. Brown spoke out against the move by transport authorities in Tyne and Wear to bring bus services under local control. \"What I believe is that the ITA [integrated transport authority] and Nexus are importing risk and cost. \"We should be doing what we do best \u2013 managing the commercial part of the network. \"And the local authority should do what they do best \u2013 green travel plans, dealing with congestion, bus lanes, those sort of issues. \"I recognise that Nexus have the right to bring in a quality contract, but it's not going to improve the lot of passengers. I believe it's in the best interests of passengers for us to be in voluntary partnerships.\" Go-Ahead are a likely frontrunner in the new, expanded Thameslink franchise, and will bid when the Department for Transport invites bids later this month. Brown denied rumours of a rift with Colas, which pulled out of a joint venture that was shortlisted to run the Docklands Light Railway franchise. He said: \"It's very disappointing because we thought we had a very good bid. It was not a falling out.\" He said wasted bid costs were less than a million pounds.",

However, he said that Walmart's decision to discipline its employees had \"nothing to do\" with the strikes.</p> <p>Those who were fired had violated \"our attendance policies under a multi-step progressive disciplinary process\" laid out in a manual, he said. Employees are given \"coachings\" when they violate policy, including, for instance, when the cash in the cash register comes up short, Fogelman said.

The report, The Low-Wage Drag on Our Economy, was produced by Democrats with the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. The committee says it chose Wisconsin because the state's data \"appears to be the most recent and comprehensive.\" The paper is an updated version of an earlier report by the same committee in 2004, which at the time estimated that a 200-employee Walmart store could account for $400,000 in public assistance for workers.</p> <p>Fast food workers interviewed by the Guardian last week also reported being given benefits such as food stamps, in order to subsidise their low wages.</p>",

The committee says it chose Wisconsin because the state's data \"appears to be the most recent and comprehensive.\" The paper is an updated version of an earlier report by the same committee in 2004, which at the time estimated that a 200-employee Walmart store could account for $400,000 in public assistance for workers. Fast food workers interviewed by the Guardian last week also reported being given benefits such as food stamps, in order to subsidise their low wages.",

China revenue growth was roughly flat in the first half of 2013 (5.4% in 2012), but InterContinental outperformed the market by around 6%.

And with Syria still causing international ructions over a possible air strike by America, there are certainly reasons for investors to be cautious. US non-farm payrolls on Friday also have the potential to cause an upset. For the moment though, the FTSE 100 is in upbeat mood, climbing 52.05 points to 6526.79. InterContinental Hotels is leading the risers, up 62p to \u00a318.98 after UBS moved from neutral to buy and raised its target price from \u00a320.50 to \u00a322. UBS said: An increase in the [hotel] pipeline should help InterContinental drive growth. We re-initiated on the company in March with a neutral rating given insufficient share upside and certain concerns. We now upgrade to buy given an improvement on a number of our concerns and recent share price weakness. One of our main concerns was the decline in the pipeline system size, which with an increase of 6% in the first half, reversed the trend we had seen since the peak of 2008. Chinese revenue per available room is still a concern but US growth continues to be strong. China revenue growth was roughly flat in the first half of 2013 (5.4% in 2012), but InterContinental outperformed the market by around 6%. We think InterContinental remains well positioned to benefit from Chinese market recovery. The company continues to benefit from strong revenue growth in the US. Consequently, we update our revenue per available room forecasts and increase our earnings per share by around 2% and 3% in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Marks &amp; Spencer has moved 14.8p higher to 493.5p as HSBC analysts raised their rating from neutral to overweight and their target price from 490p to 550p. In a note on the general retailers, they said the UK economic and housing market recovery should benefit retailers, and also lifted their target for Next, up 42p at \u00a350.30, from \u00a352 to \u00a352.15. On Marks they said: [The rating change is] premised on the introduction of new and better general merchandise collections from Autumn/Winter 2013, especially womenswear (around 5% of UK general merchandise revenues) and the highest operational gearing/sensitivity to an improvement in top line growth amongst the large cap names [we considered]. On the results front, Dixons Retail has risen 3.73p to 47.99p following news of the disposal of loss-making e-commerce operation Pixmania and Turkish business ElectroWord, alongside news of a 2% rise in like for like sales in the 12 weeks to the end of July. Still with retail, SuperGroup has soared 7.5% to \u00a312.46 after first quarter sales jumped 25.7%. Icap has climbed 29.9p to 404.8p and Tullett Prebon has added 13.3p to 376.5p after a positive note on the interdealer brokers from Morgan Stanley. It moved Icap from underweight to overweight with a 418p target and Tullett from 255p to 351p.",
