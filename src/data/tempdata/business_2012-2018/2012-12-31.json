      "bodyText": "Crisis, what crisis? A late end-of-year surge on the stock market saw investors shrug off worries about the eurozone, a slowdown in China and \u2013 a late entrant on the fear index \u2013 the US budget impasse. That helped the FTSE 100 to rise 7% since the Guardian's 2012 tips were published. Happily, our 10 choices did substantially better than the market, jumping by an average of 19.6%. Pace, the set-top box maker, was the star performer, recovering from disruption caused by a shortage of hard disk drives the previous year. Despite a late wobble when it lost out on an auction to buy Motorola's set-top box business, it soared more than 160%. Mike Ashley's Sports Direct International climbed 87% after seeing off struggling rival JJB Sports and benefiting from the London Olympics. Other notable performances came from Marstons and Kingfisher. There was of course a flop or two, notably Mariana Resources (mea culpa). The gold and silver miner has a supportive shareholder in AngloGold Ashanti, but that did not stop it losing more than half its value. Its Argentinian presence meant it was hit by worries about renationalisation, while there was disappointment at resource levels at its Las Calandrias project. And so to 2013. The eurozone, the US fiscal cliff and the wider global economy are likely to dominate sentiment once more, so the uncertain atmosphere is likely to continue. With that in mind, we've picked 10 shares we hope will perform well despite market vicissitudes. Julia Finch Home Retail Group \u2013 Homebase and Argos \u2013 has had a rough ride in recent years with shares tumbling from more than 300p to Monday's 126.7p as a result of tough competition, poor sales of computer games and the squeeze facing its less well-off shoppers. It should gain in 2013 from any improvement in the economy and consumer sentiment and from its own three-year turnaround plan. Argos is also one of the UK's most webby retailers, getting 42% of sales online. But there is another factor in its favour this year: the demise of rival Comet, putting its \u00a31bn of annual sales up for grabs. Some 75% of Home Retail's revenues come from Argos, and 51% of Argos revenues come from electricals. If Argos can grab some of Comet's 6% market share to add to its own existing 10% there should be benefits from sales volumes and margins. Simon Bowers Buying opportunities are emerging as US fiscal cliff talks go down to the wire. If you believe the underlying American economy is strengthening, and that the politicians will find a compromise in the national interest, there are plenty of London-listed stocks worth looking at. Drinks group Diageo has a strong exposure to the US market. Shares have had a good run in 2012, but have eased back a shade in recent weeks to \u00a317.87. The company was frustrated in its efforts to take over tequila brand Jose Cuervo and may only play a marginal role, if any, in the bidding war for US rival Beam next year. That may be no bad thing for the share price. Diageo does have exposures to some of the toughest European economies, but its global reach ought to mean continuing difficulties here are absorbed. The acquisition of a majority stake in India's United Spirits group will complete next year. It is just the latest development in Diageo's push into the fast-developing Bric markets. Simon Goodley Betfair chronically mis-priced its 2010 flotation when the betting exchange managed to persuade enough mugs to take a punt at \u00a313 a share. They are just over half that level now, at 686.5p, but despite there being few signs of life in the shares, the company has at least started to acknowledge previous mistakes. New chief executive Breon Corcoran, who was poached from rival Paddy Power, has started in a pragmatic mood, withdrawing from costly foreign adventures such as in Germany, where the company is struggling to foresee a future regulatory and tax regime that will allow it to make a profit. He's also retreated from vanity projects such as the company's financial betting exchange, LMAX. As both of these areas were once used to justify the Betfair float price, critics might argue that the moves make the company look unambitious. But industry insiders reckon that Corcoran has plenty of early easy wins to focus on, principally by cutting Betfair's cost base to swiftly increase profits. After more than two years as a public company, this might finally be the time to bet on Betfair. Jill Treanor 2012 was not a good year to have tipped Man Group, the world's biggest listed hedge fund group, which relies on its \"black box\" AHL flagship fund for its performance. AHL, which uses computers to spot trends in markets, has been blown off course by quantitative easing and Man's shares had fallen almost 80% since the start of 2011. Yet as 2012 drew to a close, the shares started to perk up after chief executive Peter Clarke was shown the door. Installing Manny Roman, who arrived with the acquisition of hedge fund GLC, has given investors fresh hope, while new finance director Jonathan Sorrell \u2013 son of WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell \u2013 is expected to start cutting costs. With a bit of luck, the shares \u2013 now 82.75p \u2013 will recoup their 2012 losses during 2013. Nick Fletcher Issuing a profit warning in the middle of a takeover situation is not ideal, and defence group Chemring duly suffered the consequences. Its share price collapsed, losing almost half its value over 2012, but even the prospect of a bargain-basement price was not enough to tempt potential bidder Carlyle Group to take the plunge. Chemring replaced its chief executive, and the new man, Mark Papworth, who did well at oil services business Wood Group, will outline his strategy in January. Defence spending in the UK and US is likely to remain under pressure but Chemring now has a platform for recovery. Some excitable souls even believe another bid could eventually emerge, if not from Carlyle then from another private equity group. A speculative bet at 229.6p on Papworth turning things round. Nils Pratley Think of this \u2013 Ruffer Investment Company \u2013 as an anti share tip. It is chosen to provide protection in the rainy investment weather that 2013 may bring. Jonathan Ruffer has positioned the investment trust for a tipping point, the moment when central banks' huge injections of newly created money make themselves felt. He is far from being a hyper-inflation nutter; he's just making the reasonable point that investors need to watch their backs in an era when the US Federal Reserve is openly pursuing reflation to create jobs. The fund, currently at 199.25p, is flush with index-linked government debt, gold and Japanese equities. It ain't glamorous. But, one day, those assets could be the right place to be. Is that year 2013? Ruffer is often too early in his calls, so who knows? But surely you don't expect guaranteed winners from newspapers' share tips. Terry Macalister Some online companies are in the sin bin over tax issues but Asos, with its logistics base at Barnsley in the white rose county of Yorkshire, continues to smell sweetly. The net-based fashion retailer was also heading for a \"stonking Christmas,\" according to its chief executive and founder, Nick Robertson, and there are reasons to believe its already highly valued shares, \u00a326.91, should still find more uplift next year, too. New international sales helped drive up profits 40% in the 12 months to 31 August, and there are high hopes for a forthcoming move into the Chinese and Russian youth markets. Simon Neville When SSE \u2013 Scottish and Southern Energy as was \u2013 announced a 38% boost in half-year profits in November while simultaneously raising gas and electricity prices, people were quite rightly fuming. So if you can't beat them, why not join them? 2013 for SSE is likely to see more of the same \u2013 profits continuing to rise. Throw in a dividend yield of more than 6% and you're unlikely to find a better return on such a safe investment. Confusion on Britain's energy future remains, depressing SSE's share price a little, so as we inch each day closer towards the government being forced into making a decision over the country's needs, expect a nice boost to the current \u00a314.18. And with outspoken chief executive Ian Marchant at the helm, SSE has the best chance of getting its own way. Juliette Garside TalkTalk shares are up 70% to 233.6p since January, but chief executive Dido Harding (pictured below), is only just getting going: the rollout of TalkTalk's budget pay TV service, along with fibre broadband and mobile phone deals, began in earnest in November. The model has worked well for Virgin Media and BSkyB: increase profits by selling more services to your existing customers. But TalkTalk should be able to grow headcount by tapping into Freeview's 10m users. Some of the potential is already priced in, but Goldman Sachs has a 290p target by November next year, underpinned by healthy dividend growth. Rupert Neate When one of the world's best-known activist investors declares he's made it his \"patriotic\" duty to destroy a company, there's probably something in it. The market certainly reckons Bill Ackman's on to something with his $20m bet against slimming powder and body-building supplement company Herbalife \u2013 the shares fell 38% last week when Ackman revealed his short position and accused the company of being \"the best-managed pyramid scheme in the history of the world\". Ackman, founder and chief executive of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, told investors he was more committed to bringing down Herbalife \"than any investment I have ever made, full stop\". Herbalife denies all the accusations. Although shares have already fallen to $29.39, Ackman says: \"Our target price is zero, because we think the business will fail.\" If you can get your hands on any to short (it might be quite tricky; Ackman's shorting as many as he can), you might profit from Herbalife's decline. Ackman's committed to giving all profits to charity (you don't have to).",

      "standfirst": "Whatever the outcome of the political haggling, Congress has failed the 50 million Americans below the bread line", 
      "body": "<p>The one comfort of government incompetence is that it is never a surprise: it is, if anything, a starting point for the public's expectations of Washington.</p> <p>Still, even that certainty doesn't pay the bills, and that is a problem for 2.1 million Americans who have been out of work for more than 27 weeks and will be cut off from unemployment insurance tonight. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/31/fiscal-cliff-congress-deadline-live\">No matter what happens, the fiscal cliff talks have been a failure</a>: Congress will not achieve a \"grand bargain\" to save Americans from the brunt of ill-considered, sweeping tax hikes and government spending cuts.</p> <p>That's why we'd be better off talking about the \"fiscal conscience\", the era of which seems to be coming to a sharp end tonight. Unemployment is the American crisis you hear about; poverty is the one you don't. And what the fiscal cliff covers up is what will be the slow transition of the US unemployment problem into a serious poverty problem.</p> <p>The biggest failure of the fiscal conscience is the disregard for those unemployed Americans. Some of those 2.1 million Americans who stand to lose their benefits tonight only started collecting unemployment in July. Those who have been out of work for more than six months make up 40% of all the unemployed people in America.</p> <p>The predicament of the long-term unemployed only has a passing relationship to the fiscal cliff. There happens to be no one in the government who can put their hand up and protect the unemployed. As Congress goes about wrecking confidence in the economy, there are other agencies that can pick up some of the slack.</p> <p>The Treasury Department is finding room to avoid the debt ceiling. The Internal Revenue Service has said it will hold off on imposing tax increases. The Defense Department has promised it will do what it can to delay cuts.</p> <p>But the unemployed have no one to protect their benefits. There is no agency to buy them some time: they are at the mercy of congressional bickering.</p> <p>Nothing new. For the unemployed, the fiscal cliff is the final boot on the neck of their prospects, not the first time they've been knocked down by an aggressive Congress. Congress has been chipping away at unemployment benefits for well over a year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Lawmakers in Washington have been pretending to pass \"extensions\" to unemployment benefits, but what they have really been doing is cutting them. From 2009 to 2011, when nearly one-sixth of the country was out of work, some Americans could receive 99 weeks of unemployment insurance. This year, Congress cut that maximum down to 73 weeks and, with the help of some states, put further barriers to unemployment insurance, including drug tests and national job search requirements.&#xa0;</p> <p>This would make sense if unemployment insurance were taking money out of the pockets of other, worthier programs; but it's not. American taxpayers and employers pay for unemployment insurance through taxes imposed on every paycheck. When the economy is good, and few people are unemployed, the government collects a surplus, because many people are paying the unemployment tax but few are collecting it.</p> <p>In that case, unemployment taxes reduce the deficit, and no lawmakers complain.&#xa0;When economic times turn, however, Congress rounds on unemployment benefits as deficit-burning incentivization of laziness. </p> <p>This congressional hostility towards unemployment benefits is misguided on a number of fronts. The most obvious is that employment and the economy are subject to cycles: if you're caught in a bad cycle, just keep going until things get better. They always do. In fact, there's already evidence that the labor market is improving, albeit at an excruciating pace.</p> <p>The second problem is that the focus on unemployment benefits really covers up a bigger problem: what happens when they run out. Unemployment benefits are one economic rung above one of America's economic plagues: growing poverty. This was an issue that briefly held the stage during the protests of Occupy Wall Street, but seems to have faded under the force of the election and the giddiness of a recovering economy and strong holiday shopping season.</p> <p>The options for those without unemployment benefits are grim: unless they have family to fall back on, they have no money to pay their bills. They may immediately fall into poverty. That makes them eligible for food stamps and welfare benefits \u2013 which is a greater financial cost to government than unemployment benefits alone.</p> <p>There are also other cuts embedded in the fiscal cliff that would hit the poor. Homelessness assistance would get cut by $156m, which would leave 146,000 people without a place to live, according to the <a href=\"http://chcdf.blogspot.co.uk/\">Campaign for Housing and Community&#xa0;Development&#xa0;Funding</a>. Another 185,000 low-income families would lose out on rental assistance.</p> <p>Domestic violence programs will be cut, leaving over 100,000 families without emergency shelter services; another 170,000 people won't get help for substance abuse. Over 400,000 people would lose out on job training and employment services.</p> <p>This would occur at a time of peak poverty in the United States: the US census bureau <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-14/ranks-of-poor-americans-at-record-high-even-with-aid.html\">found that 49.7 million Americans live in poverty</a>. That number rose by 700,000 people between 2010 and 2011. Congress, always out of touch, incorrectly estimated that the number of people in poverty would not rise, but actually drop \u2013 actually drop \u2013 <a href=\"http://fcnl.org/issues/budget/2011_census_poverty_report/\">by 3.2 million people that year</a>. That rift in expectations is the approximate gap between lawmakers and the real world.</p> <p>That is why the fiscal cliff is not just about taxes and government spending. It's about social conscience. The people who will be asked to be pay more in taxes are, largely, gainfully employed. But there are still 4.8 million Americans who count as long-term unemployed \u2013 that is, unemployed for more than 27 weeks \u2013 and their ranks are growing.</p> <p>The fiscal cliff cuts were designed to be bad policy \u2013 so bad that no rational lawmaker would let them come to pass. Unfortunately, in the petty Washington game of score-settling and oneupmanship, rational lawmakers don't seem to have much of a voice these days.</p> <p>That's not great for the middle class, but it's even worse for the growing ranks of the poor.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 January 2012. The original said the National Centre on Family Homelessness had estimated that 146,000 people would be left without a place to live by cuts embedded in the fiscal cliff. The estimate was made by Campaign for Housing and Community Development Funding.</p>",

That's why we'd be better off talking about the \"fiscal conscience\", the era of which seems to be coming to a sharp end tonight. Unemployment is the American crisis you hear about; poverty is the one you don't. And what the fiscal cliff covers up is what will be the slow transition of the US unemployment problem into a serious poverty problem. The biggest failure of the fiscal conscience is the disregard for those unemployed Americans. Some of those 2.1 million Americans who stand to lose their benefits tonight only started collecting unemployment in July. Those who have been out of work for more than six months make up 40% of all the unemployed people in America. The predicament of the long-term unemployed only has a passing relationship to the fiscal cliff. There happens to be no one in the government who can put their hand up and protect the unemployed. As Congress goes about wrecking confidence in the economy, there are other agencies that can pick up some of the slack. The Treasury Department is finding room to avoid the debt ceiling. The Internal Revenue Service has said it will hold off on imposing tax increases. The Defense Department has promised it will do what it can to delay cuts. But the unemployed have no one to protect their benefits. There is no agency to buy them some time: they are at the mercy of congressional bickering. Nothing new. For the unemployed, the fiscal cliff is the final boot on the neck of their prospects, not the first time they've been knocked down by an aggressive Congress. Congress has been chipping away at unemployment benefits for well over a year. Lawmakers in Washington have been pretending to pass \"extensions\" to unemployment benefits, but what they have really been doing is cutting them. From 2009 to 2011, when nearly one-sixth of the country was out of work, some Americans could receive 99 weeks of unemployment insurance. This year, Congress cut that maximum down to 73 weeks and, with the help of some states, put further barriers to unemployment insurance, including drug tests and national job search requirements. This would make sense if unemployment insurance were taking money out of the pockets of other, worthier programs; but it's not. American taxpayers and employers pay for unemployment insurance through taxes imposed on every paycheck. When the economy is good, and few people are unemployed, the government collects a surplus, because many people are paying the unemployment tax but few are collecting it. In that case, unemployment taxes reduce the deficit, and no lawmakers complain. When economic times turn, however, Congress rounds on unemployment benefits as deficit-burning incentivization of laziness. This congressional hostility towards unemployment benefits is misguided on a number of fronts. The most obvious is that employment and the economy are subject to cycles: if you're caught in a bad cycle, just keep going until things get better. They always do. In fact, there's already evidence that the labor market is improving, albeit at an excruciating pace. The second problem is that the focus on unemployment benefits really covers up a bigger problem: what happens when they run out. Unemployment benefits are one economic rung above one of America's economic plagues: growing poverty. This was an issue that briefly held the stage during the protests of Occupy Wall Street, but seems to have faded under the force of the election and the giddiness of a recovering economy and strong holiday shopping season. The options for those without unemployment benefits are grim: unless they have family to fall back on, they have no money to pay their bills. They may immediately fall into poverty. That makes them eligible for food stamps and welfare benefits \u2013 which is a greater financial cost to government than unemployment benefits alone. There are also other cuts embedded in the fiscal cliff that would hit the poor. Homelessness assistance would get cut by $156m, which would leave 146,000 people without a place to live, according to the Campaign for Housing and Community Development Funding. Another 185,000 low-income families would lose out on rental assistance. Domestic violence programs will be cut, leaving over 100,000 families without emergency shelter services; another 170,000 people won't get help for substance abuse. Over 400,000 people would lose out on job training and employment services. This would occur at a time of peak poverty in the United States: the US census bureau found that 49.7 million Americans live in poverty. That number rose by 700,000 people between 2010 and 2011. Congress, always out of touch, incorrectly estimated that the number of people in poverty would not rise, but actually drop \u2013 actually drop \u2013 by 3.2 million people that year. That rift in expectations is the approximate gap between lawmakers and the real world. That is why the fiscal cliff is not just about taxes and government spending. It's about social conscience. The people who will be asked to be pay more in taxes are, largely, gainfully employed. But there are still 4.8 million Americans who count as long-term unemployed \u2013 that is, unemployed for more than 27 weeks \u2013 and their ranks are growing. The fiscal cliff cuts were designed to be bad policy \u2013 so bad that no rational lawmaker would let them come to pass. Unfortunately, in the petty Washington game of score-settling and oneupmanship, rational lawmakers don't seem to have much of a voice these days. That's not great for the middle class, but it's even worse for the growing ranks of the poor. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 January 2012. The original said the National Centre on Family Homelessness had estimated that 146,000 people would be left without a place to live by cuts embedded in the fiscal cliff. The estimate was made by Campaign for Housing and Community Development Funding.",

    "webTitle": "Economists expect UK to lose AAA credit rating", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain is expected to lose its AAA credit rating this year, dealing a blow to George Osborne's defence of deep spending cuts as the key to retaining Britain's status with global investors. Many economists predict at least one of the three main credit ratings agencies \u2013 Moody's, Fitch or Standard &amp; Poor's \u2013 will declare the UK a bigger lending risk in response to the chancellor's admission in the autumn statement that austerity will run for at least eight years, until 2018, rather than the original five. Those same economists largely agree that in a world where most developed countries have found life tough going, there will be little impact on the UK's creditworthiness. Like the US and France, which have already seen their pride dented by a demotion to AA, the UK will still be a safe haven for foreign cash, and thereby enjoy relatively low interest rates. But lower growth and bigger borrowing add up to a greater risk that the UK will find 2013 tougher than expected. All the major forecasters have downgraded growth for the coming year, including the Treasury's own Office for Budget Responsibility. The OBR's most recent outlook put growth in 2013 at 1.2% \u2013 down from the previous prediction of 2%. Not until 2017 does the trend return to a point where unemployment comes down in any significant way. Part of the downgrade in growth stems from expectations of lacklustre investment spending by business. Without investment in new equipment, the economy is likely to suffer over the longer term. Osborne has promised a rise in public investment this year, partly to make up the difference, but only enough to make up a quarter of the total he cut in 2010. In budget terms 2013 will be characterised by social security cuts, which are due to take effect in earnest after an initial focus on tax rises (the increase in VAT to 20%) and job losses in the public sector (more than 700,000 so far). Middle income families with at least one parent paying the higher tax rates will lose some or all of their child benefit. From April cuts in disability benefits and housing benefit will slice around \u00a33bn from the social security bill. Tax credits will also be squeezed, with many people finding they are no longer eligible or suffering a cut in income. The UK may be helped by a resurgence in global economic growth. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicted in its twice-yearly economic outlook that the global economy will expand 3.4% in 2013 \u2013 up on 2.9% in 2012. Unfortunately almost all this expansion in output will take place in the far east and Africa, where UK exports have declined to a trickle. The UK's biggest market, the EU, will remain in the doldrums and the US will expand, but without breaking sweat. There was a time, back in the crisis days of 2009, when global summits sought to recalibrate the world economy and get it moving more quickly, particularly to create employment. The International Monetary Fund is among many major institutions to warn national governments that they are pursuing the type of austerity policies that lead to lower, not higher growth. Russia is host to the G20 club of countries that rescued the world in 2008 but has since found little purpose.

      "body": "<p>Britain is expected to lose its AAA credit rating this year, dealing a blow to George Osborne's defence of deep spending cuts as the key to retaining Britain's status with global investors.</p> <p>Many economists predict at least one of the three main credit ratings agencies \u2013 Moody's, Fitch or Standard &amp; Poor's \u2013 will declare the UK a bigger lending risk in response to the chancellor's admission in the autumn statement that austerity will run for at least eight years, until 2018, rather than the original five.</p> <p>Those same economists largely agree that in a world where most developed countries have found life tough going, there will be little impact on the UK's creditworthiness. Like the US and France, which have already seen their pride dented by a demotion to AA, the UK will still be a safe haven for foreign cash, and thereby enjoy relatively low interest rates.</p> <p>But lower growth and bigger borrowing add up to a greater risk that the UK will find 2013 tougher than expected.</p> <p>All the major forecasters have downgraded growth for the coming year, including the Treasury's own Office for Budget Responsibility. The OBR's most recent outlook put growth in 2013 at 1.2% \u2013 down from the previous prediction of 2%. Not until 2017 does the trend return to a point where unemployment comes down in any significant way.</p> <p>Part of the downgrade in growth stems from expectations of lacklustre investment spending by business. Without investment in new equipment, the economy is likely to suffer over the longer term. Osborne has promised a rise in public investment this year, partly to make up the difference, but only enough to make up a quarter of the total he cut in 2010.</p> <p>In budget terms 2013 will be characterised by social security cuts, which are due to take effect in earnest after an initial focus on tax rises (the increase in VAT to 20%) and job losses in the public sector (more than 700,000 so far).</p> <p>Middle income families with at least one parent paying the higher tax rates will lose some or all of their child benefit. From April cuts in disability benefits and housing benefit will slice around \u00a33bn from the social security bill. Tax credits will also be squeezed, with many people finding they are no longer eligible or suffering a cut in income.</p> <p>The UK may be helped by a resurgence in global economic growth. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicted in its twice-yearly economic outlook that the global economy will expand 3.4% in 2013 \u2013 up on 2.9% in 2012. Unfortunately almost all this expansion in output will take place in the far east and Africa, where UK exports have declined to a trickle. The UK's biggest market, the EU, will remain in the doldrums and the US will expand, but without breaking sweat.</p> <p>There was a time, back in the crisis days of 2009, when global summits sought to recalibrate the world economy and get it moving more quickly, particularly to create employment. The International Monetary Fund is among many major institutions to warn national governments that they are pursuing the type of austerity policies that lead to lower, not higher growth.</p> <p>Russia is host to the G20 club of countries that rescued the world in 2008 but has since found little purpose. Russia, bogged down in the Syrian war and gas supply disputes eastern Europe, is not seen as capable of breaking the deadlock.</p> <p>Britain will host the G8 in June. This meeting of the major economic powers has greater potential to make decisions, especially in respect of the banking system that brought the world to its knees. Tougher regulations are on the way and there are deep divisions over how fast to implement them. Go too quickly and regulators risk turning banks into zombies, unable to move or think for themselves. Slacken the regulatory knot, and they will lend recklessly again.</p> <p>Yet it is the G20 that has taken the lead on banking regulation in an attempt to get developing country members to sign up. The trouble is that countries without big banks want financial institutions bound by strict rules while those with \"systemically risky\" banks are more ambivalent.</p> <p>The UK, which has borrowed about 500% of its annual national income, mainly through reckless banks, is at the sharp end of this debate. And it is that debt that will continue to weigh on the economy.</p> <p>Banks are cutting their losses at the expense of their ability to lend.

The US has Europe as an example and both the Fed and the dollar as cushions \u2013 controlled devaluation and massively negative real yields have allowed the economy to re-balance and the housing market to start a recovery. But the reluctance of US companies to invest and hire reflects uncertainty about policy and concern at the lack of leadership they face.</p> <p>If the US economy is hostage to politics, the rest of the world is either hostage to the US or doomed to weakness unless the US drags it forwards. I think US out-performance is a \u2018done deal\u2019 in the 2013 but whether that\u2019s from a 3% growth rate or a 2% growth rate in the US depends on how the cliff-chatting progresses.</p> </blockquote> <p>And as things stand, the US is running out of time...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e9c227f8-c99f-40a5-988b-e24af698a8cd\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/31/1356956124999/91b0077b-85d3-4e49-a9de-03db2bd1386b-460.jpeg\" alt=\"A giant symbol of the European Union's currency the Euro stands outside the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB) in the central German city of Frankfurt am Main on April 29, 2010.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A giant symbol of the Euro outside the headquarters of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.

If the US gets rid of political uncertainty the next big change will be in the US, but that comes later, towards the end of the year, when we will write more about the Fed\u2019s exit strategies. Hence I think the dollar will end 2013 on an upward trajectory. As for the ECB, the way the current policy works is that the ECB prints as much money as the market wants, through OMT and through full allotment repos.</p> <p>So they aren\u2019t printing now, and the euro is trending higher. I\u2019ll bet that the current brighter mood doesn\u2019t last as far as spring and the ECB\u2019s balance sheet will be growing again. Hence, weaker euro in due course.

AussieAnalyst (who is already in 2013 and probably a bottle of fizz to the good) predicts more of the same over the next 12 months, including further interest rate cuts as central banks race to devalue their currencies. His full predictions are here. josephinireland finds himself agreeing with Merkel for the first time this year, writing: It will indeed be even tougher in the new year than it was this year. Every business person I've spoken to over Christmas has put forward an extremely negative view of the coming year. I dread to think where we may be in twelve months time. JohnPalmer reckons the German chancellor may change her own approach to the crisis in 2013, saying: 2013 may be the year when austerity gives way to policies designed to promote sustainable growth. When the leader of the German opposition says that austerity is going too far it is time to smell the coffee. The most likely outcome of the German general election in September looks like being an SPD/CDU coalition. In which case Merkel will have to change her tune to at least some degree. ShiresofEngland forecasts that the eurozone will 'kick the can' along through 2013, with major decisions postponed until the German elections are over. So a bit like 2012, a few panics, but nothing making much in the way of progress as the financial crisis goes int its sixth year. More here.... ...While FatCat08 predicts that America will replace the eurozone as the main worry for markets, adding: Tory posturing on an EU referendum will attract unwanted scrutiny on the UK's shambolic finances including Europe's worst fiscal deficit.George Osborne will be replaced before the summer. Italy will elect a suprisingly strong Monti government; Germany a CDU/CSU majority that won't need a red yellow or blue coalition partner. While KhakiSuit (when not being aghast at my fumbling Franglais) is complimentary about Greece, and the German leader: My pick for People of the Year, is the Greeks (take a collective bow, fellow commenters of Greek origin). They have endured a lot since 2009 and in 2012 they finally got really about addressing their problems. They suffered cutbacks at all levels of society. They have resisted the Siren's call of the dashing, virile, raven-haired (Helena Smith's words, not mine) poster-boy of the left*. And have finally set themselves on the road to some real austerity which, give or take a few more defaults, should eventually bear fruit. My pick for Man of the Year goes to Angela Merkel for forcing them down this path. * - \"sexy Alexis\" Tsipras And bill9651 reckons Europe's financial crisis will only be resolved by debt write-offs and eurozone exits: You bet things will get worse in 2013, because all they have been doing is kicking the can down the road and not addressing the core problem. This is the euro itself, which has effectively imposed a massively overvalued exchange rate on southern Europe and turned the likes of Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal into 'zombie states', which are chronically sick and slowly dying. The 'cure' for them is to leave the euro and agree some sensible debt write offs - until that happens the crisis will continue and become potentially explosive. More below.... Heads-up: my colleague Richard Adams is now live-blogging the race to avoid the US fiscal cliff. Definitely one to watch in the hours ahead.... Oh, and you can catch up with recent developments and our live coverage of the crisis in recent days, here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fiscal-cliff Angela Merkel's warning about tough times in 2013 (see 8.11am) comes after a strong year on the German stock market, with the benchmark DAX index up by almost 30%. Germany was one of the best-performing markets, as it bounced back from a ropy 2011. Spain's IBEX stood out by falling during the year, as its financial crisis deepened. Round-up of stock markets during 2012 FTSE 100: + 5.8% French CAC: +15.5% Italian FTSE MIB: +7.8% Spanish IBEX: -5% Athens: + 32.5% Hong Kong Hang Seng: +22.6%, Japan's Nikkei 225: +22% Chinese Shanghai index: +4.5%, .... But for truly stellar growth, you had to have your money in Venezuela - it's stock market gained almost 300%. As my colleague Nick Fletcher reports: If someone had told you at the start of 2012 to invest in a country with an ailing, anti-capitalist president who regularly seizes company assets, you could be forgiven for quickly walking away. And yet the country involved, Venezuela, is home to the best performing stock market of the year. It has jumped nearly 300% despite president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 or perhaps, as some observers have suggested, it was because investors were expecting him to step down during the year due to his treatment for cancer. Yet he won another election in October, by boosting spending and lifting the country's economy. The central bank said last week that Venezuela's economy grew by 5.5% in 2012 as a consequence of government outlay on homes for the poor and pensions for the elderly. Since the election, some of the shine has come off but Venezuela has still beaten other global markets by some margin A quick update on the US fiscal cliff situation. The best hope of a last-gasp deal comes from negotiations between Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. At present, the Democrats only want to extend existing tax breaks to 'middle-class' earners and below, while Republicans want a blanket extension. Lawmakers could still agree a deal, in principle, but in practice the legislative window is narrow - the Senate is due to resume at 11am EST (4pm GMT). Rebecca O'Keeffe, Head of Investment at Interactive Investor, sees little hope of bridging the divide, adding. With the gulf between both parties still wide and the desire to protect their supporters' key interests so ingrained; it is difficult to see how both sides can compromise enough to agree a deal at this point. US traders are refusing to panic, though, with the Dow Jones index predicted to open higher (+80 points in the futures market). Over in Greece, pressure is building on former finance minister George Papaconstantinou over allegations related to the Lagarde List of possible tax evaders. It emerged late last week (see Friday's blog), that the names of three of Papaconstantinou's relatives had apparently been removed from the original list. Papaconstantinou has insisted he is not involved and has done nothing wrong, but the country's coalition is now calling for a formal inquiry into him. AP has the latest: Seventy-one deputies from Greece's three-party coalition signed a proposal on Monday to indict Papaconstantinou for allegedly tampering with a public document and breach of duty offences that would carry a maximum 10-year jail term, according to legal experts. The 51-year-old former minister served in the previous Socialist government. But his party, which is part of the new conservative-led government, is backing the proposed indictment. Papaconstantinou angrily denies the allegations, and says the names were removed without his knowledge. It's over. London's stock market has closed for business, with concern over America's fiscal cliff negotiations sending the FTSE 100 down. The French and Spanish markets had a better day, though. FTSE 100: down 27 points at 5897, - 0.47% French CAC: up 24 points at 3649, +0.65% Spanish IBEX: up 36 points at 8167, +0.45% Is Jean Michel Jarre about to follow Gerard Depardeau out of France to escape the country's new wealth tax? That's what political news/gossip site Order Order reckons. It reports this morning that: Jean Michel Jarre, the only French global rock star, has been into Downing Street to discuss moving to London to escape Francois Hollande\u2019s tax hikes.... In secrecy Jarre recently visited Number 10 to discuss his \u201cdefection\u201d. The news that Downing Street is involved in discussions with another high profile tax exile from France will cause outrage in the Elysee Palace. So, another interesting angle on Francois Hollande's ambitions (see also 11.16am). Despite the economic turmoil, it's been a good year for stock markets with many indices posting double-digit gains during 2012 (we'll have a full round-up once European trading finishes in around 30 minutes) That's largely due to the various huge liquidity programmes undertaken by the world's central banks (from QE in the UK and US tor the special Long Term Refinancing Operations launched by the ECB a year ago). Will all this money printing a) deliver real growth, or b) stop soon? Here's Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale: Not without political leadership, is the answer to the first question. As well as petty party politicking, the Fiscal Cliff wrangling shows that there is no consensus about how to tackle the public sector debt mountain within the US, let alone among the world\u2019s leading economies as a whole. Europe\u2019s weaker nations show how far an economy has to shrink if it overdoses on austerity in the middle of a recession. The US has Europe as an example and both the Fed and the dollar as cushions \u2013 controlled devaluation and massively negative real yields have allowed the economy to re-balance and the housing market to start a recovery. But the reluctance of US companies to invest and hire reflects uncertainty about policy and concern at the lack of leadership they face. If the US economy is hostage to politics, the rest of the world is either hostage to the US or doomed to weakness unless the US drags it forwards. I think US out-performance is a \u2018done deal\u2019 in the 2013 but whether that\u2019s from a 3% growth rate or a 2% growth rate in the US depends on how the cliff-chatting progresses. And as things stand, the US is running out of time... And will the banks go on printing, Kit? Of course! The biggest change is likely to be acceleration in the pace of printing in Japan. Hence the weaker yen. If the US gets rid of political uncertainty the next big change will be in the US, but that comes later, towards the end of the year, when we will write more about the Fed\u2019s exit strategies. Hence I think the dollar will end 2013 on an upward trajectory. As for the ECB, the way the current policy works is that the ECB prints as much money as the market wants, through OMT and through full allotment repos. So they aren\u2019t printing now, and the euro is trending higher. I\u2019ll bet that the current brighter mood doesn\u2019t last as far as spring and the ECB\u2019s balance sheet will be growing again. Hence, weaker euro in due course. And at some point, Europeans will start learning from Japan\u2019s economic misfortune rather than simply trying to imitate it. Portugal will fly over its own fiscal cliff at midnight tonight, as another round of austerity is imposed on the country's population. The Portuguese 2013 Budget moves millions of people into higher tax brackets, imposes a new tax rate on high earners, cuts pension payments and welfare benefits. Despite protests, it comes into force on January 1. Economist Shaun Richards fears that the unpopular plan will backfire: ...tax revenue is already falling so raising tax rates looks likely to disappoint in terms of raising extra revenue. Put another way Portugal may already be on the diminishing returns section of the Laffer curve as for example the revenue from the rises in Value Added Tax (main rate now 23%) have disappointed too. Shaun fears that the Portuguese economy will suffer a deeper recession than official forecasts in 2013, adding: Her population can expect yet more economic pain and the objectives of getting her fiscal deficit and national debt under control seem as far away as ever. It is a very sad story to which we seem likely to add another grim chapter. Like a dog chasing its tail the ruling class in Portugal seem to have lost all sense of perspective. More here. Portuguese sovereign debt has recovered since the summer, though, with its 10-year bonds yielding 6.8% today. That suggests Lisbon could make a tentative return to the money markets in 2013 (but no guarantees!) There may be faces rouges in Paris today, after the French government's plan to impose a 75% tax on top earners was halted by its constitutional court. The court blocked the plan over the weekend, arguing that it breached French law by imposing the tax on individuals, rather than households. So two families who earn the same joint income could incur different tax burdens, depending on their individual incomes. The French government is likely to reshape the controversial measure, and Gerard Depardieu says the court ruling won't prevent him scarpering to Belgium. Laurent Dubois, a professor at the Institute of Political Studies in Paris, commented to Bloomberg: For investors and entrepreneurs, it shows that France can\u2019t be confiscatory, that there are rules that have to be followed..... the government won\u2019t drop the idea, and the commentary from the highest levels of government is anti-rich, and that\u2019s a red flag. Greek retail sales have tumbled very sharply, according to data just released. Sales were down by 18.1% in October, compared with the previous year. The pace of the decline picked up sharply compared with September (-11.8%), and August (-9.3%). Nearly a year ago, we were writing about the slump in retail sales in Greece, and the last 12 months of austerity and recession have only accentuated the situation. One in three Athens' retailers had closed by the end of September. Over in Greece, a new opinion poll has found that nearly two-thirds of people believe 2013 will be worse than previous years, reports Kathimerini. The survey also found that the left-wing Syriza party, currently the largest opposition party, has a narrow lead over the ruling New Democracy party (22.6% vs 21.5%). Over in the US, negotiations to avert automatic spending cuts and tax increases are heading down to the wire. Republicans and Democrats again failed to reach a deal to avoid the Fiscal Cliff over the weekend, and many analysts now reckon the US will topple over it tomorrow, President Obama may present an emergency bill to Congress later today to avoid the worst impact. As my colleagues Matt Williams and Rory Carroll wrote last night, That simple \"up-or-down vote on a basic package\" would stop tax hikes for middle-income Americans, while \"laying the groundwork for future progress on more economic growth and deficit reduction\", Obama said on Saturday. But even that may have difficulty passing through the House, given the entrenched position of some Tea Party-backed Republicans. In London, the stock market has fallen in early trading as the deadlock in America over the Fiscal Cliff remains unbroken. The French stock market is a little higher, while most other markets are already closed until the new year. FTSE 100: down 21 points at 5904, - 0.36% CAC: up 5 points at 3625. + 0.15% It's a half-day trading session in Europe, by the way, so City traders will be heading home around lunchtime.... Crisis watcher Yannis Koutsomitis \u200freckons there's no doubt about the key figure in the eurozone in 2012. This is Angela Merkel's final new year address before she faces the voters in a general election (scheduled for autumn 2013). Her call for a renewed crackdown on \"irresponsibility\" in the financial markets may play well with the German electorate. Her main rival, the SPD's Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, has said he would make sweeping changes if elected. As Reuters put it: Political analysts believe Merkel nevertheless still has the most options to form a government after the vote. She could lead a right-left grand coalition with the SPD as she did from 2005 to 2009 or a coalition with the pro-environment Greens party. Merkel said she hoped there would be more controls next year on international financial markets - a popular issue in Germany that the SPD is planning to make a central plank of its 2013 election campaign. While AFP says Merkel is 'steeling' Germans for a difficult year, pointing out: Although top exporter Germany has managed to hold up to the crisis fairly well, growth has slowed here as well since the beginning of the year. After expanding by 0.5 percent in the first quarter of 2012, gross domestic product (GDP) grew by just 0.3 percent in the second quarter and a mere 0.2 percent in the third quarter. And in October, the government slashed its forecast for economic output next year to 1.0 percent, compared to 1.6 percent previously anticipated. As it's the final live blog of 2012, we're particularly keen to hear your predictions for 2013. Is Merkel too pessimistic about next year, or is the chancellor simply talking sense? Was Mario Draghi the real hero of 2012, and who were the villains? And what else should we take away from the last 12 months of elections, summits, deals and brinkmanship, which ended with the eurozone in recession but the EU clutching the Nobel Peace prize? Good morning, and welcome to our final day of rolling coverage of the eurozone debt crisis, and other key events in the world economy, for 2012. We're ending the year with a solemn warning from Angela Merkel that the crisis has not run its course, despite the waves of optimism that have swept some parts of Europe in recent months. In her new year message, the German chancellor warned that 2013 will be challenging , saying: I know that many are also heading into the new year with trepidation. And indeed, the economic environment next year will not be easier, but more difficult. That should not discourage us, but - on the contrary - serve as an incentive. And on the eurozone crisis, she was adamant that more work must be done, despite the progress made this year: The European sovereign debt crisis shows us how important this balance is. The reforms we have agreed to are beginning to take effect. But we still need a lot of patience. The crisis is far from over. More needs to be done internationally, as well, to monitor the financial markets. The world has not sufficiently learned the lesson of the devastating financial crisis of 2008. For never again must such irresponsibility be allowed to take hold as it did then. In the social market economy, the state is the guardian of order, and the public must be able to place its trust in it. The full text is online, in English, here. The comments are more downbeat than we've heard from other senior politicians and officials in recent weeks. Just last Thursday her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, declared that 'the worst is over' for the eurocrisis. But with the eurozone struggling to return to growth, and public anger against austerity unabated, it's clear that 2013 will indeed be tough. I'll be tracking reaction to Merkel's new year message in the blog, along with other key developments as a historic year for Europe draws to a close.....",

Why our food is making us fat This may make painful reading after the excesses of Christmas but we are, on average, 3st heavier than we were in the 1960s \u2013 and not because we're eating more or exercising less. The most-read story on the business site last year showed how the food industry has super-sized the global population and turned us into sugar addicts. 2. $21tn: hoard hidden from taxman by global elite Public anger over tax avoidance was one of the key themes of 2012 and Observer business editor Heather Stewart's story on the huge riches amassed by a global super-rich elite really struck a chord. Exploiting gaps in cross-border tax rules, they managed to hide an extraordinary \u00a313 trillion ($21tn) of wealth offshore \u2013 as much as American and Japanese GDPs put together, according to research commissioned by the campaign group Tax Justice Network. 3. It's payback time: don't expect sympathy \u2013 Lagarde to Greeks In May, IMF chief Christine Lagarde chose an interview with the Guardian's Decca Aitkenhead to rachet up the pressure on crisis-hit Greece, declaring she had more sympathy for children deprived of decent schooling in sub-Saharan Africa than for many of those facing poverty in Athens. Using some of the bluntest language yet seen in the crisis, Lagarde insisted it was payback time for Greece. The story sparked a fierce debate among readers, generating more than 3,200 comments. 4. GM profits slip 41% as European struggles take their toll Dominic Rushe's story on plunging profits at General Motors was our fourth most popular story last year. The 41% drop in the second quarter underlined the knock-on effect of the European crisis on the US economy, which at that point was still doing pretty well. 5. Cost of Greek exit from euro put at $1tn There are 12 noughts in a trillion and in May that was the truly scary estimate of the cost to the EU of Greece making a disorderly exit from the currency. The British government was said to be making urgent preparations to cope with the fallout of a possible Greek exit from the single currency, after the governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, warned Europe was \"tearing itself apart\". Reports from Athens, meanwhile, said massive sums of money were being spirited out of the country. 6. Krugman: 'I'm sick of being Cassandra. I'd like to win for once' In an interview with Decca Aitkenhead, the American Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman outlined his strategy to end the financial crisis \u2013 ditch austerity, kickstart the economy with ambitious government spending, and bring down the deficit when we're back above water again. Most important of all, do it now. That was in June. The undisputed Cassandra of academia, Krugman joked: \"I'm kind of sick of being Cassandra. I'd like to actually win for once, instead of being vindicated by the disaster coming \u2013 as predicted.\" 7. Bob Diamond resigns from Barclays \u2013 live Shortly after 7.30am on Tuesday 3 July, Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond resigned. His abrupt departure, just six days after the bank was fined \u00a359.5m for attempting to manipulate the Libor rate, send shockwaves through the City. Our eurocrisis expert Graeme Wearden leapt into action with a live blog rounding up all the political and City reaction, as well as the hastily arranged Barclays press conference. Diamond blamed the 'external pressure' that had build up on Barclays, as MPs called for his resignation and the government announced an inquiry into the affair. His departure was followed within hours by that of Jerry del Missier, one of Diamond's key allies. 8. Wealth doesn't trickle down \u2013 it just floods offshore A second entry in the Top 10 for Heather Stewart and the $21tn in assets estimated to have been lost to global tax havens. This more detailed article based on research for the Tax Justice Network campaign group constructs an alarming picture of capital flooding out of countries across the world and disappearing into cracks in the financial system, with the world's super-rich siphoning off at least $21tn, and possibly as much as $32tn, from their home countries to hide abroad. 9. Eurozone crisis live: Markets slide as Greek euro exit looms Graeme Wearden tirelessly charted the twists and turns of the eurozone crisis in his daily blog \u2013 and 14 May was one of the darkest days of 2012, when Greece looked odds-on to quit the eurozone.

And yet the country involved, Venezuela, is home to the best-performing stock market of the year. It has jumped nearly 300% despite the policies of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 or perhaps, as some observers have suggested, it was because investors were expecting him to step down during the year due to his treatment for cancer. Yet he won another election in October, by boosting spending and lifting the country's economy. The central bank said last week that Venezuela's economy grew by 5.5% in 2012 as a consequence of government outlay on homes for the poor and pensions for the elderly. Since the election, some of the shine has come off but Venezuela has still beaten other global markets by some margin. Another notable performance came from Greece, as the country's widely expected exit from the eurozone was averted for the moment, and it received the necessary tranches of bailout cash. So the Athens market rose 32.5% last year. Elsewhere, the Hang Seng added 22.6%, the Nikkei 225 climbed 22% and the Shanghai market 4.5%. India added 25.7%, South Africa was 23% better and Russia rose 10.5%. The German market outperformed all of those, with the Dax adding 29.5%. But the rest of Europe was more mixed, which is hardly a surprise given the continuing worries about the eurozone. France's Cac finished 15.5% higher, Italy rose 7.8%, but Spain was down 5% on fear of contagion. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial average added nearly 6%, the S&amp;P more than 11% and the Nasdaq composite more than 12%. Finally, the FTSE 100 finished up 5.84%.",

That was up from 34% in November and only 24% in October.</p> <p>Modest festive cheer from retailers comes despite widespread expectations of a pickup in inflation, which is likely to hit disposable incomes. A report from SAS and Verdict predicts retail sales growth will climb just 1.8% in 2013,with much of that increase attributed to rising food prices.</p> <p>As well as tentative confidence from retailers, firms operating in the public sector, banks and other services companies also harboured hopes, albeit modest ones, for the year ahead. Only the industrial firms taking part in the survey of 300 firms with a turnover of more than \u00a31m indicated confidence was, for them, on the wane.</p> <p>Trevor Williams, chief economist of Lloyds commercial banking division, suggested this was likely to be a reflection of the continued recession in the eurozone as well as uncertainty looming over the US economy because of political deadlock on Capitol Hill.</p> <p>\"The upward momentum in confidence in the past two months, if sustained, would point to a return to growth in the early stages of 2013, though external risks remain, including continuing issues in the euro area and the US fiscal cliff. Nevertheless, as we end the year, it is good to see businesses in a more upbeat mood about the economy and their own trading prospects.\" The survey found 40% more businesses were optimistic for 2013 than were pessimistic.</p> <p>The cautious optimism identified by Lloyds was echoed by remarks from John Walker, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, in a new year message to David Cameron. \"Confidence is still low, with many concerned about lack of demand and wider economic issues, but our members are heading into 2013 with more confidence than they did going into either 2011 or 2012. This is a move in the right direction and something the government must build on in the new year.\"</p> <p>But, Walker added, banks were still failing to provide the finance companies needed, with less than 10% of small businesses reporting easy access to credit. He said relations between small businesses and Britain's biggest lenders had hit new lows after the Financial Services Authority confirmed it had found widespread \"serious failings\" in the way complex interest rate swap products had been aggressively sold to corporate clients, many of them small family firms.</p> <p>Also delivering a pointed new year message to government on Sunday was John Cridland, head of the employers' lobby group, the CBI. In a move that appeared designed to quieten resurgent eurosceptic voices within the Conservative party, Cridland warned Cameron the UK risked being sidelined in global trade talks if it did not take its seat at the negotiating table as part of a larger European Union bloc.</p> <p>\"We can't beat around the bush \u2013 we pack a bigger punch in securing trade deals inside the EU than outside,\" he said. \"The US wants the big prize \u2013 access to a market of 500 million customers across the EU, not just 60million on our own shores. So the best way of getting the right deal for the UK is on an EU-wide basis. The EU must be the launchpad for UK business to trade with the rest of the world, carving out a new global role for ourselves.\"</p>",

Modest festive cheer from retailers comes despite widespread expectations of a pickup in inflation, which is likely to hit disposable incomes. A report from SAS and Verdict predicts retail sales growth will climb just 1.8% in 2013,with much of that increase attributed to rising food prices. As well as tentative confidence from retailers, firms operating in the public sector, banks and other services companies also harboured hopes, albeit modest ones, for the year ahead. Only the industrial firms taking part in the survey of 300 firms with a turnover of more than \u00a31m indicated confidence was, for them, on the wane. Trevor Williams, chief economist of Lloyds commercial banking division, suggested this was likely to be a reflection of the continued recession in the eurozone as well as uncertainty looming over the US economy because of political deadlock on Capitol Hill. \"The upward momentum in confidence in the past two months, if sustained, would point to a return to growth in the early stages of 2013, though external risks remain, including continuing issues in the euro area and the US fiscal cliff. Nevertheless, as we end the year, it is good to see businesses in a more upbeat mood about the economy and their own trading prospects.\" The survey found 40% more businesses were optimistic for 2013 than were pessimistic. The cautious optimism identified by Lloyds was echoed by remarks from John Walker, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, in a new year message to David Cameron. \"Confidence is still low, with many concerned about lack of demand and wider economic issues, but our members are heading into 2013 with more confidence than they did going into either 2011 or 2012. This is a move in the right direction and something the government must build on in the new year.\" But, Walker added, banks were still failing to provide the finance companies needed, with less than 10% of small businesses reporting easy access to credit. He said relations between small businesses and Britain's biggest lenders had hit new lows after the Financial Services Authority confirmed it had found widespread \"serious failings\" in the way complex interest rate swap products had been aggressively sold to corporate clients, many of them small family firms. Also delivering a pointed new year message to government on Sunday was John Cridland, head of the employers' lobby group, the CBI. In a move that appeared designed to quieten resurgent eurosceptic voices within the Conservative party, Cridland warned Cameron the UK risked being sidelined in global trade talks if it did not take its seat at the negotiating table as part of a larger European Union bloc. \"We can't beat around the bush \u2013 we pack a bigger punch in securing trade deals inside the EU than outside,\" he said. \"The US wants the big prize \u2013 access to a market of 500 million customers across the EU, not just 60million on our own shores. So the best way of getting the right deal for the UK is on an EU-wide basis. The EU must be the launchpad for UK business to trade with the rest of the world, carving out a new global role for ourselves.\"",
