      "bodyText": "A private hearing is to take place in December in which the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is thought to be pressing ahead with seeking legal documents from Barclays as part of its ongoing investigation into the bank\u2019s 2008 rescue fundraising. The hearing can be revealed after reporting restrictions were lifted by Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith, following representations by the Guardian and other publications. The judge gave no reason why the restrictions had been imposed or why he had lifted them. As the case is taking place in private, the discussions between the SFO and Barclays will still not be reported when the hearing takes place. But, in lifting the restrictions, the judge allowed three elements to be reported: that there is a hearing in December where the SFO is applying for access to evidence held by Barclays, that the hearing is taking place in private, and that the bank is defending the application on the basis that the material sought is covered by legal professional privilege. The SFO is continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the way more than \u00a37bn was raised by Barclays during the banking crisis. The bank admitted in September 2013 that it was fighting a \u00a350m fine by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in relation to the matter. Barclays, which continues to contest the allegations, said at the time it had been issued with a formal warning notice from the FCA, which has warned the bank that it \u201cacted recklessly\u201d in the way it disclosed information about \u00a3322m of fees paid to Qatar Holdings during the fundraising. In so doing, the regulator said it had breached some of the rules governing the way shares are listed on the stock exchange. The Guardian led the legal challenge to the reporting restriction which was brought along with the Financial Times, Bloomberg, the Times and the Daily Telegraph. Barclays said it \u201cdoes not comment on ongoing legal matters\u201d. The SFO said it was not able to provide any information in addition to that provided.",

      "bodyText": "Dan Graham never expected he\u2019d be looking for real estate to house a business other than his own. The entrepreneur launched BuildASign.com, an online custom sign printing business, in 2005. The company\u2019s ranks soon swelled to 300 employees; revenue is expected to come in around $90m in 2015, up from $70m last year. In his spare time, Graham mentored other entrepreneurs. Supporting other startup founders who were trying to launch new businesses from coffee shops or their kitchen table gave Graham an idea. What if there was a dedicated office space for them to go while they readied their companies for launch and beyond? He began looking for such a place, and soon found one not far from BuildASign.com\u2019s headquarters in Austin, Texas. In January, Owen\u2019s Garage officially opened its doors. With 15 startups now populating 6,500 sq ft and paying between $150-$400 per month to rent space in Owen\u2019s Garage, Graham says his first order of business is taking care of people. \u201cIt\u2019s not a money maker for me,\u201d he says. \u201cThe primary goal is giving [the entrepreneurs] one less thing to worry about.\u201d One of those things is a professional space to see clients and confer with staff. Collaboration and camaraderie are other reasons why many choose the co-working route. A study by Emergent Research predicts that globally, co-working membership should grow about 40% per year to pass 1 million members by 2018. In a global survey of over 2,700 co-working facilitators, seven out of 10 claimed they couldn\u2019t keep up with the demand for desk space. 60% of existing facilities were on track to expand last year, according to recent data from Desk Mag. This explains why Graham didn\u2019t think much beyond his initial good intentions. Without a clear strategy, he recalls that challenges arose immediately, from dealing with a leaky roof to having the Wi-Fi blink out. Though co-working spaces provide peace of mind from the worry of who might be looking over your shoulder, Graham points out that when businesses are elbow-to-elbow, other problems arise. Good vibrations and negative undertones This was what happened to Kurt Rathmann, CEO of ScaleFactor Partners, one of the first businesses to join Owen\u2019s Garage. With his own accounting and office operations business just a year old, Rathmann was more than ready to move out of his living room and into a more professional environment. At first, the flexible terms and the ability to create partnerships with the other companies working there were huge perks, Rathmann says. But as ScaleFactor Partners grew, Rathmann says preserving his startup\u2019s culture was a concern, because, as he puts it, \u201cyou don\u2019t get to choose your neighbors\u201d. A communal environment can be challenging, particularly when noise and activity from other tenants becomes too distracting. Entrepreneurs are also prone to \u201chigh highs and low lows\u201d, says Rathmann \u2013 sometimes in the same hour. ScaleFactor Partners has logged steady growth since its inception, according to Rathmann, but other businesses in the space haven\u2019t been as lucky. Rathmann says he sometimes felt that negative vibes permeated the common areas like the kitchen, as well as the open office space. \u201cWe felt this judgement from a lot of folks that we were disruptive,\u201d he says. Rathmann says he worked around this by having meetings in closed rooms and constantly reiterating to the growing staff that they were working hard to eventually move into their own space. By the time the staff grew to 16 full-time workers, Graham reports that ScaleFactor Partners moved out of the more communal space and into another side of the building. \u201cNow we have a door,\u201d Rathmann says. \u201cBut we are still part of the community.\u201d Brand visibility vs visible distractions Kyle Rosenbaum, founder and CEO of the marketing and branding agency Kyle Arnett, originally started using the co-working space WeWork as a \u201cvirtual member\u201d, paying to use the global office sharing startup on an as-needed basis. (The Guardian has been a WeWork tenant since moving its US newsroom in June.) But as his agency started to grow, Rosenbaum realized he needed to establish more of a presence, as well as have a place for his contract workers to gather when they were working on a project together. He now pays around $2000 per month for a space big enough to accommodate himself and three colleagues. Rosenbaum says he is impressed by the amenities at WeWork, like the conference rooms, which are integrated with the latest AV equipment. \u201cClients are impressed by the technology in meetings,\u201d he says. But he admits he hasn\u2019t availed himself of many of the other perks, most notably access to health care or human resources, which has helped WeWork climb to a $10bn valuation. Rosenbaum says that the rapidly growing coworking community harbors challenges amid the amenities such as meditation rooms, free beer on tap, and karaoke \u2013 namely getting acclimated to new neighbors. Rosenbaum says that there are challenges amid the meditation rooms, free beer on tap, and karaoke, namely getting acclimated to new neighbors. A veteran of three different WeWork spaces in Manhattan, Rosenbaum says the energy changes depending on the location and the tenants. \u201cThere is always a new class of startups coming in at the beginning of each month,\u201d he says, adding that no one at WeWork is masterminding the complex choreography required to put likeminded businesses and personalities closer together. (A company spokesperson from WeWork declined to make anyone available for this story.) Coming from a more formal corporate environment at Nickelodeon, Rosenbaum says he experienced a culture shock at WeWork. Though he maintains his company is pretty casual, other entrepreneurs and freelancers who share the space are even more lax. \u201cAt the end of the day, this is a business, and real things need to get done,\u201d Rosenbaum says. \u201cSome people are there for the fun \u2013 they focus on showing off as opposed to showing up.\u201d For Rosenbaum, it took moving to WeWork\u2019s location in Manhattan\u2019s financial district to change the dynamic. \u201cThere\u2019s a much stronger sense of camaraderie,\u201d he says. Desk Mag\u2019s recent survey shows nine out of 10 professionals left a poorly rated co-working space within 12 months. The whims of Wi-Fi and other pitfalls Both Rosenbaum and Rathmann agree that losing an internet connection is an inevitable problem for members of a co-working community. For Rathmann, a four-hour internet outage could cost him as much as $3000, a calculation that he says he didn\u2019t make initially. \u201cWe went in blindly and hoped it wouldn\u2019t be an issue,\u201d he says, mainly because he was one of the first tenants and didn\u2019t know of any data connection problems. Since then, Rathmann says he\u2019s had to have several conversations with TimeWarner, the internet service provider, to ensure there was a proper redundancy installed to mitigate downtime. Now that his company is installed in a dedicated space at Owen\u2019s Garage, Rathmann says he\u2019s also invested in a dedicated company network. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t completely solve the internet going out, but we isolated ours to handle our number of users,\u201d he says. One thing Rathmann did consider from the beginning was privacy and security. ScaleFactor Partners handles accounting records for a number of small businesses, so it\u2019s important the data remain secure. Because of the communal space and the potential threat of theft, Rathmann says the five CPAs on staff never leave their laptop in the office. Any paper documents are locked in a fortified filing cabinet with multiple locks. Rathmann says that he had to implement a checklist system for his staff to fill at the end of each day to track who was responsible for the lockups. Though there is a temptation to move out completely to maintain control his own space, Rathmann says the co-working space is less expensive than signing a three-year lease on a commercial space. For now at least, flexibility trumps any other frustration.",

      "bodyText": "US stock markets fells significantly on Monday due to renewed concerns about the health of the Chinese economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 313 points (1.9%) to 16,002 points, following losses on other markets across the world. Analysts said anxiety was heightened among investors by official Chinese government statistics showing that the country\u2019s industrial powerhouse companies\u2019 profits plunged 8.8% last month \u2013 a much steeper drop than previously thought. Global stock markets tumbled in August and earlier in September due to concerns of a slowdown in China, the world\u2019s second largest economy. Investors are worried that a slowdown in emerging markets will begin slowing the economy of the US and other western nations. Multinational companies listed in the US and Europe are increasingly reliant on growth in developing nations for future expansion and profits. Caroline Bain, senior commodities economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe market is looking for direction and probably the most likely source of that is Chinese data. \u201cWe\u2019ve had quite a bit of stimulus already and it hasn\u2019t yet been reflected in any sort of rebound in activity.

John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Fund Management, said: \u201cWhenever the market is down, the first place to look these days is China. Right now, we need evidence that China is not slowing that much and that profits are still going to be OK.\u201d All the major economic forecasters have scaled back their predictions for global growth in recent months and blamed the slowdown in China as the main reason. The S&amp;P 500 closed down 50 points (2.6%) to 1,882 points and the Nasdaq lost 143 points (3%) to 4,544 points. The stock market falls were steeper in Europe, with the FTSE 100 in London losing 150 points (2.5%) to fall below the psychologically important 6,000 points barrier. The CAC 40 in France lost 2.8% and the German Dax 2.1%. Biotechnology stocks, until recently a high-flying sector, suffered the sharpest falls, followed by mining, energy and basic materials stocks.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hello again. It was a bad day on Wall Street too, as fears over the global economy and the usual fretting about a US interest rate hike sent shares sliding. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed down 1.9%, or around 312 points lower at 16002. And a rout in the biotech sector helped to sent the Nasdaq index down 3%. And with October - often a lively month in the markets - around the corner, we could be entering an exciting period. Come back tomorrow so see whether European indices recover, or take another bath.... G\u2019night. GW It\u2019s been a surprisingly busy Monday here in Europe, so let\u2019s recap the main points. Shares in commodity miner and trader Glencore have plunged by 29% today. The cost of insuring Glencore\u2019s debt has also spiked, as speculation swirled over its ability to ride out the downturn in the resources sector. The Glencore out was triggered by City firm Investec, which warned that the company\u2019s shareholders could be wiped out unless commodity prices recover. Founder Ivan Glasenberg\u2019s stake is now worth rather less than \u00a31bn. Europe\u2019s financial markets are all deep in the red, with the FTSE 100 losing 150 points. Over in America, the Dow Jones industrial average has shed 1.5%; the broader S&amp;P 500 is down 2%. Traders were alarmed after Chinese factories reported the biggest drop in profits in at least four years. The Volkswagen emissions crisis continues, with a German minister warning that the country\u2019s economy could suffer from the turmoil. Martin Winterkorn, the former CEO, is now being investigated by prosecutors. They want to know how 11 million cars were sold containing \u2018defeat devices\u2019. Audi has admitted that 2.1m of its cars used the software, while fellow VW brand Skoda sold 1.2m. Green campaigners are delighted that oil giant Royal Dutch Shell is pulling out of the Arctic. But there is dismay in Redcar where the local steelworks is to be mothballed. And in Spain, Catalan independence parties are celebrating a partial success in yesterday\u2019s elections, where they won a majority of seats but not votes. It could mean more political upheaval in the eurozone. There were chunky losses across the Big 5 European stock markets tonight. Spain actually outperformed the rest, with investors relieved that Catalan separatists didn\u2019t win a majority of votes in Sunday\u2019s election (they won a majority of seats, though). Volkswagen shares have been hit hard again, closing down 7.5% in Frankfurt tonight. BMW have shed 2.9%, and Daimler are down 3.2%. In Paris, Peugeot has lost 4.5%, with Renault off 4.3%. The scandal of faked emissions tests is continuing to dog the car industry, as prosecutors continue to probe and consumers lose faith. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets reckons the City isn\u2019t impressed with the new Volkswagen boss either: The emissions scandal is starting to look like a real albatross around the neck of the automotive sector. The choice of Matthias M\u00fcller as new VW chief is a positive first step to address the emissions scandal but the concern is that the selection of the Porsche CEO is too insular and won\u2019t provide the kind of culture change needed. Wow. After a traumatic session, Glencore shares have closed for the day down a staggering 29% at around 69p, a new alltime low. Those fears that the company\u2019s shareholders could be wiped out, unless commodity prices recover, have sparked a remarkable rout today. That means Glencore shares have almost halved since the company tapped shareholders for fresh capital just two weeks ago (!), at 125p per share. Other miners slumped too, with Anglo American shedding 10% and BHP Billiton down 6% . Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, explains that: Downbeat [industrial profit] numbers out of China overnight plus the prospect of US rate hikes making dollar denominated commodities even more expensive once again took the shine off the situation. And that wiped 150 points off the FTSE 100, which ended 2.4% lower at 5958 points. Every major Western stock market is in the red right now: The FTSE 100 has now shed 2.1%, today as the mining sector rout continues. This has wiped 127 points off the blue-chip index, which has currently just 5980. Conner Campbell of SpreadEX explains: Widening losses for the FTSE saw the index fall below the 6000 level it has struggled with all month, spurred on by a truly dismal showing from its commodity stocks. Sharp declines for Brent Crude and copper (as the metal barely kept its head above the 6 year lows seen in August) had serious ramifications for the oil and mining sectors, with the latter having an astonishingly bad day. Anglo American approached its lowest price since its IPO in 1999, whilst Rio Tinto shed 100 points and KAZ Minerals plunged by 20%. Of course, the worst performer remained Glencore, which spent the day dipping its toes in fresh all-time lows as investors began (or rather, continued) to run out of patience with the stock. The German DAX is also down 2% (Volkswagen is partly to blame) while the French CAC has slid 3%, led by carmakers and banks. Another Volkswagen shoe has dropped, with Skoda announcing that it sold 1.2m cars containing the devices used to trick emissions testers. The New York stock market has opened in the red, echoing the falls in Europe today. The Dow is down by around 0.7%, or 116 points, in early trading. Sir Richard Branson has found a silver lining in the dark cloud enveloping Volkswagen. The Virgin Group chief told CNBC that the emission test revelations should encourage manufacturers to develop clean energy, and move away from diesel cars. Branson argued: \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to Volkswagen is actually positive news in that hopefully the car manufacturers will do the right thing and will invest in the future.\u201d Branson isn\u2019t planning to buy a VW-made car, though, as he\u2019d want to operate a \u201cclean\u201d vehicle. Or a spaceship, of course. Currency Wars can work wonders for exports. That\u2019s according to new research from the International Monetary Fund, which found that a 10% fall in the value of a nation\u2019s currency can boost exports by an average 1.5%. Timely stuff; suggesting American firms will suffer from the recent strength of the US dollar. Another new low for Glencore.... shares just slumped to 66.67p, down 31% today. Glencore isn\u2019t the only mining company having a bad day. Shares in Anglo American are down 8.6%, on track for a record low. Germany\u2019s deputy finance minister, Jens Spahn, has admitted what we already suspected -- the Volkswagen emissions scandal could hurt the country\u2019s economy. Spahn told a conference today that: \u201cThe car industry is crucial for the German economy. It [the emissions scandal] can have a big impact on the German economy. This should worry us a little.\u201d (quote via Reuters) Shell\u2019s decision to abandon drilling in the Arctic (see earlier post) has been welcomed by the Green Party. Their leader, Natalie Bennett, told the party\u2019s conference that oil giants need to be kept out of the region. \u201cCampaigners against dirty energy will breathe a sigh of relief today. The decision was clearly a reaction to low oil prices and reflected the growing importance of renewable energy sources. \u201cShell and other oil and gas companies do not have a good track record when it comes to environmental safety. As we head to the Paris climate change talks later this year, global leaders must make a commitment to ensuring that fossil fuel reserves are kept in the ground, as the science dictates. We cannot allow Shell and others to return to the Arctic.\u201d As the gloom deepens over Glencore, the cost of insuring its debt against default has jumped sharply to a record high. A credit-default swap that would pay out if Glencore defaulted has jumped from 554 basis points on Friday to 708 basis points today. That means it would cost \u00a3700,000 per year to insure \u00a310m of five-year Glencore bonds. The VW story is rattling along fast today; with German prosecutors announcing they have started an investigation against former Volkswagen CEO Martin Winterkorn. Braunschweig-based prosecutor\u2019s office said that they will examine: \u201callegations of fraud in the sale of cars with manipulated emissions data\u201d. They are trying to discover who was responsible for using secret devices to evade US emissions tests. The move comes five days after Winterkorn resigned, insisting he was not aware of any wrongdoing on his part. It\u2019s a bleak morning for workers in Redcar, in the North East of England. The town\u2019s iron and steel making plant is to close, with the loss of 1,700 jobs, following the slide in steel prices. Local MP Anna Turley has criticised the plant\u2019s owner, SSI, and the government for not keeping the plant going. She said: \u201cRedcar was built on steelmaking, Teesside was built on steelmaking. It\u2019s about generations of people that have worked in that blast furnace and fought so hard, not just in the last few days but in the last few weeks, months, years, to keep steelmaking alive. It\u2019s just been allowed to fizzle out.\u201d The slump in Glencore\u2019s share price has hit founder Ivan Glasenberg in the pocket. He owns over 8% of the company, which was worth \u00a36bn when Glencore floated in 2011. The crumbling share price means its now worth under \u00a31bn, by our calculations. Obviously Glasenberg has other assets too, but there\u2019s a risk he could be downgraded from \u2018billionaire\u2019 to \u2018ex-billionaire\u2019. The word \u2018rout\u2019 doesn\u2019t really do justice to Glencore\u2019s share price today: We have another development in the Volkswagen scandal -- Audi has revealed that 2.1 million of its cars worldwide were fitted with software to cheat emissions tests. This covers 577,000 cars in Germany, 1.42 million in other Western European countries, and 13,000 in the US. Audi added that its A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5 models are affected. This is a portion of the 11 million cars from across VW\u2019s stable of brands, including Audi. Back in Frankfurt, Volkswagen shares have slumped by 6% as the emission scandal casts a fog over Germany. Other carmakers are leading the DAX fallers too: Over the weekend, it emerged that the European Central Bank had suspended purchases of Volkswagen bonds through its quantitative easing programme. If other purchases follow suit, it could be harder for VW to finance its operations.... Here\u2019s the key slide from today\u2019s Investec report, showing how Glencore investors could be flattened unless commodity prices scramble back. Glencore, though, argues that its debt pile is less alarming than it appears, because it holds large reserves of copper and iron ore which can be sold if needed. Glencore is turning into one of the greatest destructions of shareholder value in recent years. Its shares have fallen steadily since floating just four years ago - today\u2019s selloff means they\u2019ve lost 84%. The Volkswagen emissions scandal has taken another twist. There are reports that the heads of research and developments at its VW, Porsche and Audi divisions have just been suspended: The news came as Angela Merkel\u2019s chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, told Bloomberg TV that Volkswagen must explain how illicit software was installed on 11 million cars to evade emission tests. This is a serious matter. Volkswagen must clarity what went wrong, how it went wrong, and how it can be repaired. City firm Investec appears to have triggered the rout in Glencore\u2019s shares today, with a very bearish analyst note. Investec warned that Glencore\u2019s equity value could be wiped out unless the prices of key commodities (such as iron ore and copper) pick up. It wrote: \u201cThe challenging environment for mining companies leads us to the question of how much value will be left for equity holders if commodity prices do not improve.\u201d Glencore has just raised $2.5bn in a new equity issue -- at 125p per shares, and is also cutting its dividend to help cut $10bn from its $30bn debt pile. But with the Chinese economic slowdown continuing, and commodities prices slumping, will this be enough? This morning\u2019s share price reaction suggests not.... Yikes - Glencore shares are now down by 10%, as analysts speculate that investors could be wiped out. Shares in commodity trading firm Glencore are slumping to fresh record lows today. Fears over the Chinese slowdown, and debt-laden Glencore\u2019s ability to ride it out, have dragged its shares down 8% this morning to 89p. They\u2019ve now lost 70% of their value this year alone, and over 80% since floating at 530p in 2011. Glencore launched a debt restructuring last month, to cut its borrowings from $30bn to $20bn. Analysts fret that the company\u2019s debt pile could become increasingly hard to manage, unless commodity prices rally. Back in the UK, German discount supermarket chain Aldi has announced it will start selling goods over the internet. Aldi is starting with life\u2019s essentials - shipping wine by the case early next year, followed by special offers of non-food products. The move comes after Aldi posted record sales for 2014, as its no-frills approach proves a winner with UK consumers. In the oil sector, Royal Dutch Shell has abandoned its plans to drill off the coast of Alaska. The company admitted this morning that its \u201cBurger J\u201d exploration well, located in Alaska\u2019s Chukchi Sea, had proved disappointing. It told shareholders: For an area equivalent to half the size of the Gulf of Mexico, this basin remains substantially under-explored. Shell has found indications of oil and gas in the Burger J well, but these are not sufficient to warrant further exploration in the Burger prospect. The move will cost Shell $4.1bn in writedowns and contractual commitments, but will be welcomed by environmental groups. Shares in mobile giant Vodafone have fallen by 3% this morning, after talks with rival Liberty Global over asset swaps floundered. European stock markets are all as red as the moon this morning: Traders are blaming the 8.8% fall in Chinese industrial profits in August, which is the biggest decline since at least 2011. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: The negative opening comes after August Chinese Industrial Profits declined at their fastest annual pace since records began four years ago, with growth hurt by currency devaluation and financial market volatility, which just adds to the growing slowdown worries overshadowing the world\u2019s #2 economy and impacting the commodities space. The partial victory secured by separatist parties in Catalonia last night is also a factor, he adds: A pro-independence win for the Catalonia electorate also adds to Eurozone political risk, showing desire for the key state to break away from Spain and means the likelihood of an official Scottish like \u2018Yes or No\u2019 vote in the next 18-months. Catalonian debt is falling in value this morning after separatists took control of Catalonia\u2019s regional government last night, possibly heralding another chapter in the eurozone crisis. The yield on Catalan 10-year bonds has jumped to 4.23%, from 3.99%, meaning the debt is seen as riskier. As Ashifa Kassam reports from Barcelona, the election result could plunge Spain into one of its deepest political crises of recent years - even though it wasn\u2019t a formal vote on independence. \u201cWe won,\u201d said Catalan leader Artur Mas i Gavarr\u00f3, as a jubilant crowd waved estelada flags at a rally in Barcelona. \u201cToday was a double victory \u2013 the yes side won, as did democracy.\u201d After attempts by Catalan leaders to hold a referendum on independence were blocked by the central government in Madrid, Mas sought to turn the elections into a de facto referendum, pledging to begin the process of breaking away from Spain if Junts pel S\u00ed won a majority of seats. His party fell six seats short of a majority on Sunday. But Mas vowed to push forward with independence. \u201cWe ask that the world recognise the victory of Catalonia and the victory of the yes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have won and that gives us an enormous strength to push this project forward.\u201d Investors aren\u2019t panicking too much, though. Spanish sovereign debt remains calm this morning: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A new week begins with another bout of worries over the global economy, and a new political headache for Europe\u2019s leaders after Sunday\u2019s Catalan election. A sharp drop in profits at China\u2019s factories, down almost 9%, has sparked more concern that its economy is slowing fast. From Melbourne, Angus Nicholson of IG reports: Chinese industrial profits data came in below consensus expectations and immediately spurred selling in Chinese and Japanese markets.... Chinese industrial profits prompted further concerns about the economy as they declined 8.8% from a year earlier. Mining, coal, oil &amp; natural gas all continued to see profit declines between 40-68%. And this leaves investors fretting that the world economy isn\u2019t able to support a rise in US interest rates, which could still come this year. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: With Fed officials seemingly intent on raising rates this year come what may, there is a fear that the Fed might be on the cusp of making a big mistake. It still remains far from clear how weak or otherwise economic conditions in China are, with Nike\u2019s quarterly results showing some decent numbers in the China region, however concerns remain about the weakness of the manufacturing sector. And in Spain, parties that support Catalonia\u2019s separation from the rest of Spain won control of the regional parliament at last night\u2019s election. That\u2019s going to put more pressure on Madrid to consider a proper referendum on the issue, even though separatists didn\u2019t quite win a majority of the votes. And there\u2019s no escape from the emissions scandal gripping Volkswagen. Over the weekend, German media claimed that the carmaker was warned in 2011 that it was cheating on emissions tests. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "The crisis enveloping Volkswagen has intensified as German prosecutors opened an investigation of the former boss of the world\u2019s biggest carmaker, Martin Winterkorn, over the emissions scandal. As a senior German politician expressed concerns about the effects on the wider economy, Winterkorn became the subject of a preliminary inquiry by prosecutors in Braunschweig into possible fraud relating to the sale of vehicles with manipulated emissions data. Braunschweig is a town close to Wolfsburg, the home of VW. The carmaker has been rocked by the scandal, which erupted 10 days ago when a US government agency revealed that it had discovered VW had been using sophisticated software to cheat emissions tests. Since then shares in VW, a lynchpin of the Germany economy, have been in freefall. They are now down 40% since the US Environmental Protection Agency accused the carmaker of installing a \u201cdefeat device\u201d, which reduced nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions under test conditions. The latest slump in the shares \u2013 they lost 7.5% on Monday \u2013 came after VW provided more detail about the 11m cars caught up in dodging the emission tests. Some 2.1m are Audis \u2013 A1, A3, A4, A5, A6, TT, Q3 and Q5 models \u2013 and 1.2m are Skodas. Car owners in the UK are still awaiting information about how many of the affected vehicles were sold here. Lawyers in the UK and other countries said there was likely to be an avalanche of claims when it becomes clear where the cars fitted with the defeat devices were sold. The company refused to comment on reports that three senior executives \u2013 Heinz-Jakob Neusser, head of brand development at VW, Ulrich Hackenberg, head of research and development at Audi, and Wolfgang Hatz, R&amp;D chief at Porsche \u2013 had been suspended. It also refused to confirm reports that one of the biggest US law firms, Jones Day, was being lined up to lead an internal investigation. Reuters has reported that Hackenberg is taking legal action. Winterkorn was named in a statement issued by the German prosecutors, who said he was being investigated over \u201callegations of fraud in the sale of cars with manipulated emissions data\u201d. The prosecutors said they were trying to establish who was responsible for the installation of the defeat devices. In Germany prosecutors are obliged to investigate allegations and in this case it is understood charges have been filed by about 10 individuals. Winterkorn, one of the highest paid bosses in Germany, could not be reached for further comment. But when he quit last Wednesday \u2013 just 48 hours before he had been expected to be confirmed in the top job for another five years \u2013 he insisted that he was not responsible for the scandal gripping the business he has run since 2007. \u201cAbove all, I am stunned that misconduct on such a scale was possible in the Volkswagen Group. I am doing this [resigning] in the interests of the company even though I am not aware of any wrongdoing on my part,\u201d he said last week. His replacement, Matthias M\u00fcller, who was head of Porsche, which is owned by VW \u2013 is now scrambling to repair the company\u2019s reputation. According to a letter seen by Reuters, he told staff: \u201cVW is in a dramatic situation. It will be far from easy to restore the reputation of the company and win back trust from customers.\u201d The company has set aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.8bn) to cover the costs of the scandal, but analysts expect the final total to be much higher given that fines levied in the US alone could reach $18bn (\u00a312bn). Germany\u2019s deputy finance minister, Jens Spahn, said the wider Germany economy could also be hit by the scandal. \u201cThe car industry is crucial for the German economy,\u201d he told a conference. \u201c It [the scandal] can have a big impact on the German economy. This should worry us a little.\u201d Vehicle products make up 17% of German industrial output, according to economists at Capital Economics, while the automotive industry accounts for almost 5% of overall economic output. Economists calculate that if industries with ties to vehicle manufacturing are included, as many as 15% of German jobs may be reliant on the industry in some way. However, they have played down the long-term impact of the scandal on the economy. The company is also facing protests from investors at its annual meeting next month. Hans-Christoph Hirt, a director at the advisers Hermes EOS, which represents about 40 investors, intends to raise questions about the make-up of the board and call for changes to corporate culture. \u201cThe supervisory board\u2019s choice of corporate insiders as CEO and chair-elect also raises some real doubts whether the key shareholders have recognised the need for fundamental reform and a real new beginning,\u201d said Hirt. Hirt said he had been in contact with about six other major carmakers to seek clarity on whether they were being drawn into the emissions scandal.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe should see the start of a period of price appreciation for commodities in general.\u201d So said Ivan Glasenberg in August last year, before proceeding to bet Glencore\u2019s balance sheet on that happy outcome. The mining-cum-trading house hiked its interim dividend by 11% and launched a $1bn share buyback. Any temptation to pay down borrowings, which then stood at $37bn, was resisted. The important thing, declared Glasenberg, was to \u201cleverage tightening commodity fundamentals\u201d \u2013 in other words, take full advantage of the good times around the corner. Such hubristic statements have now met the full force of a Chinese economic slowdown. The price of copper, the biggest contributor to Glencore\u2019s earnings, has fallen by a quarter in the past year. Glasenberg is the not the first mining titan to look a fool. At times over the past decade, this industry has appeared to be on a mission to demonstrate the wisdom of Yogi Berra \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s hard to make predictions, especially about the future,\u201d as the obituaries reminded us last week. But it should not be so difficult, if your boardroom is working properly, to finance a company employing 180,000 people in a prudent manner. On that score, Glencore\u2019s directors have failed. The source of the company\u2019s woes is simple: borrowings of $30bn at the last count, or $47bn if you exclude inventories, are too high for current conditions. Investors fear the benefits of the belated $2.5bn fund-raising a fortnight ago will be lost in the wash if markets remain depressed for another year or so. Monday\u2019s astonishing 29% fall in Glencore\u2019s share price to 68.6p was attributed to a single analyst\u2019s calculation that the equity could be worthless at current commodity prices. In reality, Investec was merely repeating what others have been saying: that Glencore is so financially leveraged that judging a fair value for the equity is guesswork. If commodity prices improve, the shares are massively underpriced; if they don\u2019t, Glencore may need a lot more capital. The company grumbles about the short-selling activities of wicked hedge funds but shouldn\u2019t. Glencore could have stayed out of the line of fire if only it had raised more capital earlier. The moment to act was June, when serious cracks appeared in the Chinese growth story. At that point, Glencore\u2019s shares were 270p. A large rights issue would have been painful, but sometimes you have to pay up to banish doubts about your balance sheet. The baffling part is Glasenberg has been here before. In 2008, during the last commodities bust, Glencore\u2019s credit default spreads blew out as debt markets lost confidence. Glencore easily survived the scare but Glasenberg nevertheless led the business to the stock market in 2011, seemingly to secure access to permanent capital. But, having gained that security feature, he declined to use it as China slowed, and even had to be cajoled by investors into launching the modest $2.5bn placing. Was that because Glasenberg wanted to resist any dilution of his own 8% holding, now reduced to less than \u00a31bn in value? Or does he just believe his appetite for debt will be vindicated in the end? Whatever the explanation, the non-executive directors \u2013 led by chairman Tony Hayward and including John Mack, former Morgan Stanley supremo \u2013 should be embarrassed by the sight of Glencore\u2019s shares being blown around like those of a bewildered, head-in-the-sand bank, circa 2008. They should be asking themselves some hard questions. Here\u2019s one: BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, the two companies with the best mines in the industry, have the most conservative balance sheets. Why does Glencore, with higher-cost mines and a trading division that requires vast supplies of cheap capital, have the most aggressive? Shell can take cold comfort over Arctic failure Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden would never admit it, but he may be relieved that the group\u2019s first deep well drilled into the Arctic seabed has found no useful oil. Now he can abandon the Arctic expedition with the minimum of fuss. There is no need to explain to sceptical shareholders why expensive Arctic exploration had previously survived a cull in the group\u2019s capital expenditure budget. And he doesn\u2019t have to risk more damage to Shell\u2019s environmental reputation. Shell has spent some $7bn in the Arctic \u2013 a fifth of its exploration budget since 2007 \u2013 but retreat has seemed the obvious step, whatever the test well produced, since the oil price fell below $100 a barrel a year ago. Why did it take so long to pull out? At a push, one might say that, having spent such colossal sums, Shell had to find out what lay beneath. Unfortunately, one suspects an equal role was played by old-fashioned corporate pride.",

      "bodyText": "The embattled commodities group Glencore has suffered one of the worst trading days ever for a FTSE 100 company, as its shares slumped to another record low on the back of concerns about the Chinese economy and warnings from a major investment bank that the value of the company could \u201cevaporate\u201d. Shares in the miner and commodity trader, which is run by the billionaire Ivan Glasenberg, dropped by 29% to 68.62p \u2013 a daily share price fall that rivals losses suffered by banks and technology companies during their respective sector crashes in the previous decade. Following the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008, shares in HBOS, that subsequently had to be rescued by rival Lloyds, crashed by 17% . At the height of the dotcom crash in 2001, Marconi lost more than 50% in a single day, as investors punished the telecommunications equipment company for suspending its shares before delivering a profit warning. Glencore\u2019s market value has now shrunk by 87% since the company was floated on the London stock exchange in 2011 at 530p. The company has been particularly harshly treated by the markets during 2015, with the shares beginning the calendar year at around 300p, only to come under unrelenting pressure from struggling commodity markets as previously booming demand from China has slowed. The performance of the group\u2019s shares, combined with its high debts, forced the company into a humiliating U-turn earlier this month when shareholders pushed it into a $2.5bn (\u00a31.6bn) fundraising, in a series of moves aimed at cutting its $30bn (\u00a319.7bn) of debts as swiftly as possible. However, they slumped again on Monday after a research note written by Investec analyst Hunter Hillcoat, said: \u201cMining companies gorged themselves on cheap debt in a race to grow production following the Chinese stimulus that occurred in the wake of the global financial crisis. The consequences are only now coming home to roost, as mines take a long time to build. We expect commodity markets to remain subdued for several years to come given that excess supply has coincided with a slowdown in demand.\u201d He added: \u201cIf major commodity prices remain at current levels, our analysis implies that, in the absence of substantial restructuring, nearly all the equity value of both Glencore and Anglo American could evaporate.\u201d The Investec comments came on a day when the markets were also spooked by further signs of weakness in the world\u2019s second largest economy. Official data from China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics showed that profits earned by Chinese industrial companies declined at the sharpest rate in four years in August, as costs kept rising and product prices kept falling. While that added to the pressure on all natural resources shares, Glencore suffered the most. Elsewhere, shares in rival Anglo American lost 10%, while BHP Billiton shed 6% and Rio Tinto almost 5%. The latest drop in Glencore\u2019s share price means that Glasenberg \u2013 whose stake was valued at around \u00a36bn when the company floated \u2013 is no longer a paper billionaire on the basis of his Glencore stake alone. His current holding is worth around \u00a3832m. Glencore\u2019s 2011 float was among the largest \u2013 and most controversial \u2013 ever seen in London. At the time, the gargantuan listing valued the Switzerland-based company at about \u00a337bn, despite its reputation for secrecy and scepticism that it could maintain its huge trading profits. The float meant Glasenberg \u2013 along with his four closest lieutenants \u2013 Daniel Mat\u00e9, Telis Mistakidis, Tor Peterson and Alex Beard \u2013 all became paper billionaires. All five men subscribed to additional shares in this month\u2019s fundraising to maintain their stake in the company at around 20%. Glasenberg personally contributed $210m. While the slump in Glencore shares has shrunk Glasenberg\u2019s paper fortune, he has accumulated considerable wealth from his stake. A payment this week will take the dividends he has received from Glencore since it floated to more than $780m, which he claims alongside his annual pay package of around $1.5m. Apart from selling new shares to cut debts, Glencore has also announced a range of cost-cutting measures, including selling some assets and suspending production at copper mines in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It has axed the full-year dividend payout to shareholders, due in 2016, as well as next year\u2019s interim dividend. The series of measures will find the company an extra $10.2bn, which will be used to cut debts \u201cto the low 20 billions of dollars by the end of 2016\u201d, it said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In the spring of 2011, when the commodities trading giant Glencore was on the verge of floating on the London stock exchange, media outlets received a pointed communiqu\u00e9 from one of the company\u2019s law firms. The correspondence, mailed by \u201creputation management experts\u201d Schillings, stated that Glencore\u2019s bosses were \u201cextremely private individuals\u201d and that any reports about their homes or private lives would pose a \u201csecurity risk\u201d. The implication was that the freshly revealed wealth of these previously obscure businessmen created a kidnap risk. It was easy to see why. Glencore was the biggest stock exchange float in British history, so large that it became the first newly floated company to be fast-tracked into the FTSE 100 since the major privatisations of the 1980s. The listing created paper billionaires out of the firm\u2019s boss Ivan Glasenberg and his four key lieutenants: Daniel Mat\u00e9, Telis Mistakidis, Tor Peterson and London-based Alex Beard. Glasenberg\u2019s \u00a36bn paper fortune meant he had become so rich that his 3,600 neighbours in the Swiss village of R\u00fcschlikon got a tax cut. Still, if leaking the addresses of the Glencore billionaires might have put these men and their families at risk in 2011, you might argue they would be doubly exposed now. Having presided over a company that has lost investors 87% of their stakes \u2013 which equates to more than \u00a330bn vanishing from the coffers of investors such as the UK pension funds compelled to buy the shares \u2013 there must be plenty keen to tap on Glasenberg\u2019s door to ask: how did it go so wrong? The more nuanced question, perhaps, might be: how did it go so wrong, again? Because this is hardly Glencore\u2019s debut when it comes to financial crises. Some in the City wonder if its audacious business model only works when the markets play ball. For example, at the height of the credit crunch in 2009, Xstrata (the miner that was then 35% owned by Glencore) needed \u00a34bn and launched a rights issue to raise the cash. Glencore was required to stump up around \u00a31.4bn to avoid having its stake diluted, but was struggling to finance the purchase. So, Xstrata controversially arranged to buy Colombian coal mines from Glencore in order to help its main shareholder raise the funds to participate. That was hardly its first tight spot. Back in 1993, a disastrous attempt to corner the world zinc market cost Glencore $172m (\u00a3113m) and almost bankrupted the company. The losses forced its fugitive founder Marc Rich to relinquish control of the firm and sell it to his inner circle, a group that included Glasenberg. Glasenberg eventually became the firm\u2019s boss and accumulated considerable wealth, although as the company\u2019s largest shareholder he has shared some of the financial pain. His stake \u2013 worth \u00a36bn at the float \u2013 is now valued at less than \u00a31bn, although the billionaire has been paid almost $800m in dividends since 2011. So what has triggered the crisis this time? Certainly, a stuttering Chinese economy has meant less demand for many of the commodities that Glencore produces and trades, leading to falling prices that have hit all its rivals. But the group\u2019s flotation pitch - that its trading arm combined with its mining business would partly insulate it during the difficult years - has not worked, at least not well enough to assuage investors\u2019 fears that the extra debt required to keep the hybrid structure running adds to the risks. Meanwhile, Glasenberg\u2019s perceived arrogance has irked and magnified his misjudgments on how the financial markets might move. In 2014, when unveiling what now looks like a massively over-confident initiative to spend $1bn buying back Glencore shares, Glasenberg said: \u201cThe supercycle ain\u2019t over, China is still buying, demand for commodities hasn\u2019t tapered off, it\u2019s even higher than it\u2019s ever been. \u201cThe demand is pretty good. We\u2019ll grow. We may do acquisitions where you\u2019re not creating more supply in the market.\u201d The group was also bullish enough to force through the 2013 takeover of Xstrata after initial resistance from the target\u2019s shareholders. Glasenberg even had to call on the services of the former UK prime minister Tony Blair in order to persuade Qatar Holding, Xstrata\u2019s largest investor, to back the deal. It all looks very different now, although the company refuses to comment publicly on its slumping shares. Privately, Glencore\u2019s aides insist the firm is stable and talk about continuing to implement \u201cits debt reduction plans\u201d, a programme to cut borrowings by $10bn that was forced on it by shareholders and announced earlier this month. Still, while it may appear to be good sport replaying some of Glasenberg\u2019s more disastrous mutterings - especially as he was once billed as the world\u2019s smartest trader - it is far from a joke for many. Frighteningly, there are those expecting it to get worse from here, with analysts openly raising the possibility that a company floated for \u00a337bn in 2011 - which then swallowed the \u00a326bn-rated miner Xstrata - might actually be worth nothing. Meanwhile, it is hardly hyperbole to say that Glencore\u2019s woes are being felt across the globe. Apart from trading the world\u2019s commodities, Glencore produces large quantities of them. It owns mines and stakes in miners all over the world: extracting copper from the Democratic Republic of Congo; its chrome, platinum and vanadium operations are located across the Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces in South Africa; while zinc is sourced from Kazakhstan. The share price fall - and more specifically the efforts to reduce debts by suspending production in Africa - is having actual effects in the wider world. On Monday Zambia\u2019s currency, the kwacha, went into freefall, as it was hit by general fears about the commodity markets as well as worries that Glencore might further rein in its extensive operations in the country. The company has already announced plans to lay off more than 3,800 workers due to lower metal prices and high production costs. Another group people you might add to the list of those wanting to queue outside Glasenberg\u2019s front door.",

      "body": "<p>In the spring of 2011, when the commodities trading giant Glencore was on the verge of floating on the London stock exchange, media outlets received a pointed communiqu\u00e9 from one of the company\u2019s law firms.</p> <p>The correspondence, mailed by \u201creputation management experts\u201d Schillings, stated that Glencore\u2019s bosses were \u201cextremely private individuals\u201d and that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/19/rise-of-glencore-commodities-company\">any reports about their homes or private lives</a> would pose a \u201csecurity risk\u201d. The implication was that the freshly revealed wealth of these previously obscure businessmen created a kidnap risk. It was easy to see why.</p> <p>Glencore was the biggest stock exchange float in British history, so large that it became the first newly floated company to be fast-tracked into the FTSE 100 since the major privatisations of the 1980s. The listing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/04/glencore-float-to-make-boss-a-6bn-fortune\">created paper billionaires</a> out of the firm\u2019s boss Ivan Glasenberg and his four key lieutenants: Daniel Mat\u00e9, Telis Mistakidis, Tor Peterson and London-based Alex Beard. Glasenberg\u2019s \u00a36bn paper fortune meant he had become so rich that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/02/ivan-glasenberg-neighbours-glencore-tax-windfall\">his 3,600 neighbours</a> in the Swiss village of R\u00fcschlikon got a tax cut.</p> <p>Still, if leaking the addresses of the Glencore billionaires might have put these men and their families at risk in 2011, you might argue they would be doubly exposed now. Having presided over a company that has lost investors 87% of their stakes \u2013 which equates to more than \u00a330bn vanishing from the coffers of investors such as the UK pension funds compelled to buy the shares \u2013 there must be plenty keen to tap on Glasenberg\u2019s door to ask: how did it go so wrong?</p> <p>The more nuanced question, perhaps, might be: how did it go so wrong, again? Because this is hardly Glencore\u2019s debut when it comes to financial crises. Some in the City wonder if its audacious business model only works when the markets play ball.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/28/glencore-turbulent-history-a-timeline\">Glencore's turbulent history: a timeline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For example, at the height of the credit crunch in 2009, Xstrata (the miner that was then 35% owned by Glencore) needed \u00a34bn and launched a rights issue to raise the cash. Glencore was required to stump up around \u00a31.4bn to avoid having its stake diluted, but was struggling to finance the purchase. So, Xstrata <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/18/xstrata-rights-issue-glencore\">controversially arranged to buy Colombian coal mines</a> from Glencore in order to help its main shareholder raise the funds to participate.</p> <p>That was hardly its first tight spot. Back in 1993,<strong> </strong>a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/19/rise-of-glencore-commodities-company\">disastrous attempt to corner the world zinc market </a>cost Glencore $172m (\u00a3113m) and almost bankrupted the company. The losses forced its fugitive founder Marc Rich to relinquish control of the firm and sell it to his inner circle, a group that included Glasenberg.</p> <p>Glasenberg eventually became the firm\u2019s boss and accumulated considerable wealth, although as the company\u2019s largest shareholder he has shared some of the financial pain. His stake \u2013 worth \u00a36bn at the float \u2013 is now valued at less than \u00a31bn, although the billionaire has been paid almost $800m in dividends since 2011. <br></p> <p>So what has triggered the crisis this time? Certainly, a stuttering Chinese economy has meant less demand for many of the commodities that Glencore produces and trades, leading to falling prices that have hit all its rivals.</p> <p>But the group\u2019s flotation pitch - that its trading arm combined with its mining business would partly insulate it during the difficult years - has not worked, at least not well enough to assuage investors\u2019 fears that the extra debt required to keep the hybrid structure running adds to the risks.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile, Glasenberg\u2019s perceived arrogance has irked and magnified his misjudgments on how the financial markets might move.</p> <p>In 2014, when unveiling what now looks like a massively over-confident initiative to spend $1bn buying back Glencore shares, Glasenberg said: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.mining.com/glasenberg-supercycle-aint-over-demand-higher-than-its-ever-been-30677/\">The supercycle ain\u2019t over, China is still buying, demand for commodities hasn\u2019t tapered off, it\u2019s even higher than it\u2019s ever been.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mining.com/glasenberg-supercycle-aint-over-demand-higher-than-its-ever-been-30677/\">\u201cThe demand is pretty good.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s steel industry has been in meltdown for years: slowing demand and a flood of cheap Chinese steel into the market has hammered high-cost western producers. About half of the 1.6bn tonnes of steel made globally each year now comes from China. But an already perilous situation for British steelmakers has exacerbated in the past year as the Chinese economy slowed sharply, forcing Beijing to aggressively chase foreign cash for its wares. Tom Blenkinsop, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on steel and MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, summed up the dilemma: \u201cChina is pouring steel into the European and world market for any currency it can get.\u201d Flooding the market with cheap Chinese product has forced the price of slab steel down by 45% in just 12 months, from $500 (\u00a3330) a tonne to about $280. As a result, China\u2019s steel exports have grown 53% in the last year. In Britain, imports of Chinese steel have ballooned from 2% of UK demand in 2011 to 8% this year. This influx of cheap steel is a threat to all but the fittest western players \u2013 bad news for SSI UK, which is one of the weakest. Britain\u2019s second biggest steelmaker has confirmed plans to axe 1,700 jobs and mothball its Redcar plant. It threatens to bring the curtain down on 160 years of steelmaking in the Teesside region of north-east England. It is the latest grisly chapter for Britain\u2019s once mighty steel industry. Steel produced on Teesside was used to build well-known UK structures including Birmingham\u2019s Bullring and Canary Wharf in east London. However, the industry now employs about 20,000 workers, a 10th of the number employed in the sector during the 1970s. SSI UK, owned by Thailand\u2019s biggest steelmaker Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI), is the most high-profile casualty of China\u2019s stranglehold on the market. It has buckled under the weight of $1.4bn of debts and the Teesside plant has racked up huge losses every year since 2011, when SSI bought it from Tata Steel for $500m. Tata Steel UK, which owns the remnants of the former British Steel, is also struggling against the Chinese tide. Losses at the country\u2019s biggest steelmaker doubled last year to \u00a3768m. Tata has responded by slashing jobs, mothballing the Llanwern works near Newport, south Wales, and launched a failed attempt to sell its Scunthorpe steel mill, in north Lincolnshire, to Gary Klesch, the billionaire industrialist who owns the Klesch group of global industrial commodities. The Scunthorpe plant, which makes steel for the construction and engineering sectors, is widely predicted as the sector\u2019s next big casualty. One signifier of Scunthorpe\u2019s fate will be what Tata decides to do with its Dalzell and Clydebridge mills, in Scotland. \u201cThey are downstream from Scunthorpe [as they do steel plating] so you are going to take the satellite sites first,\u201d one source said, adding: \u201cI can see other sites going the same way [as Redcar] within the next six months.\u201d It is a grim reality check for a once proud sector that was at the heart of the industrial revolution.",

      "bodyText": "Retail bosses fear the government is to dampen down a revamp of business rates that could help fund the introduction of the national living wage. Industry sources with knowledge of the talks between retailers and the Treasury warned they were \u201cextremely concerned by the lack of ambition\u201d and that \u201cpatience is running out across the business community\u201d. George Osborne pledged last year to review business rates and announced the findings before the 2016 budget. The controversial property tax brings in more than \u00a325bn a year for the Treasury but retailers claim it is damaging high streets and is linked to outdated property valuations rather than economic output. The options for the Treasury include valuing Britain\u2019s property more regularly or moving the tax away from property to base it on the revenues generated from a particular site. However, retailers are concerned about the lack of progress that the review has made and frustration has boiled over since the chancellor announced the national living wage in the summer budget in July. Retail is one of the sectors most affected by the national living wage and a string of companies, including John Lewis, have warned that they could have to restructure their benefit scheme, increase prices, or cut jobs to pay for it. Mike Spicer, the director of research and economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said Treasury officials were \u201cdumbing down expectations\u201d about the outcome of the review. \u201cAll the noises have been: \u2018Don\u2019t get your hopes up, there is not going to be any change\u2019,\u201d he said. In a statement, the British Retail Consortium said: \u201cRetail supported the government\u2019s decision last year to take a proper look at the inequities of this system. \u201cThree-quarters of the way through this \u2018radical\u2019 review, we are all looking for some sign that the government intends to keep to the spirit in which the review was announced. \u201cAn important first step would be to freeze the uplift until 2017 and then lower the UBR [tax rate] to rebalance rates away from property intensive industries who suffer most under this pernicious tax.\u201d A Treasury spokesman said the review would not be complete until the end of the year and that it has offered rates relief to 575,000 small businesses. The Treasury spokesman said: \u201cThe government wants to ensure the tax system is fair, efficient and effective. We are considering the impact of business rates on the retail sector as part of the ongoing business rates review which will complete by the end of the year.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A 10% fall in the value of a nation\u2019s currency can boost exports by an average 1.5% of GDP, according to a study by the International Monetary Fund that reveals the benefits of a cut in the exchange rate for foreign trade. Heightening fears that the global economy is likely to suffer a new round of currency wars, the report said global trade was still dominated by the export of goods such as cars and fridges that sold better after a cut in the exchange rate made them cheaper. The report forms a key element of the IMF\u2019s world economic outlook, which is due to be published next week when the global lender of last resort holds its biannual meeting in Lima. Concerns that some of the world\u2019s major nations ducked reforming their economies by opting to devalue their currencies in a desperate dash for trade-driven growth has dogged the debate over the global recovery. Governments stand accused of embarking on currency wars to defend export industries that would be priced out of global markets without the support of an artificially low exchange rate. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, made it a central plank of his manifesto to improve exports by driving down the value of the yen. He drafted in a new central bank chief, who embarked on a massive programme of electronic money printing similar to the quantitative easing programmes adopted by the Bank of England and US Federal Reserve. The IMF said the yen has fallen by 30% since mid-2012 against a basket of currencies. The European Central Bank embarked on a similar policy in January, helping the euro to fall by more than 10% since early 2014. Meanwhile, the US dollar is up more than 10% since mid-2014. The Washington-based organisation said these currency movements since the financial crisis had been \u201cunusually large\u201d, especially the shifts seen in the last couple of years. \u201cBrazil, China, and India have also seen unusually large changes in their currency values,\u201d it said. \u201cNot surprisingly, these movements have kindled a debate on their likely effects on trade. Some predict strong effects on exports and imports, based on conventional economic models. Others argue that the increasing fragmentation of production across different countries - the so-called rise of global value chains - means that exchange rates matter far less than they used to for trade, and may have disconnected altogether.\u201d The IMF\u2019s study found that most trade was still \u201ctraditional\u201d and involved the export and import of finished goods and services that were sensitive to price movements. It said that while global firms have created supply chains that straddle many countries and are insulated from movements in currencies by long-term contracts and hedging instruments, they are not a dominant feature. IMF officials said they were relieved that a reduction in a country\u2019s exchange rate fed through to trade levels because it meant currency rises and falls continued to act as a rebalancing mechanism in world trade and stimulus to sustainable global growth. But the wide-ranging report will be seen by some policymakers as providing the evidence governments need to embark on currency manipulation as a means to increase exports. The finding that a 10% fall in the value of a nation\u2019s currency can boost exports by an average 1.5% of GDP will be enough to spur some governments to adopt policies that devalue their currencies. Fears have already intensified in recent weeks that Japan will re-double its eforts to drive down the cost of the yen after a 3.5% rise against the dollar and 6.5% jump against sterling in the last month. Japan\u2019s currency is considered a safe haven in the region, encouraging investors to buy yen assets and drive up its value. Worried at recent developments, the Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, said at the weekend that he expects a weaker yen, hinting that the central bank will boost its QE programme. There is also a warning for the UK, which has suffered a fall in manufacturing exports following a 20% rise in the value of sterling. The pound has tumbled in recent weeks following a recovery in the euro, but analysts expect the fall to be temporary and for the high value of sterling to continue burdening exporters.",

      "bodyText": "Aldi is to open a new front in its assault on the UK grocery market early next year when it begins selling wine online. The move comes despite the impact of the continuing price war on the group, which has suffered its first fall in operating profits in six years. Matthew Barnes, chief executive of Aldi in the UK and Ireland, said a huge part of an \u00a311m decline in operating profits last year, to \u00a3260m, was due to price cuts, as Aldi responded to waves of activity by its bigger rivals. However, Barnes said the company was determined to keep its prices well below rival grocers: \u201cThere is no doubt that the price wars have registered in our results and will continue to do so in 2015 but the 15% price gap is cast in stone and one of the foundations of our business,\u201d said Barnes. \u201cWe have a frank approach to making sure we are hands down cheaper than any of our rivals.\u201d Sales rose more than 30% to \u00a36.9bn for the 12 months to December 2014 as the company opened more stores and attracted 1.4m new shoppers. Julie Palmer, partner at insolvency specialists Begbies Traynor, said Aldi\u2019s fall in profits was disappointing after growth of 65% in 2013 and 124% in 2012. \u201cToday\u2019s results show that even Aldi can\u2019t escape the clutches of the ongoing supermarket price war. As its bigger rivals have committed to investing billions of pounds worth of price cuts over the next few years, Aldi has been forced to react in kind,\u201d she said. Barnes said he expected supermarket prices across the industry would continue to fall this year but believed the pace was slowing. \u201cCompetitors realise they are not going to win that battle,\u201d he said. Aldi was by far the fastest-growing supermarket in the UK last year. Sales increased by 17% in the past three months as sales at rivals Tesco, Morrisons and Asda fell, recent industry figures showed. Aldi\u2019s growth is largely driven by new stores. The group is on course to open 65 of its no-frills stores this year, up from 54 openings in 2014. While rivals including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons are shutting outlets, Aldi is aiming for 1,000 stores by 2022, up from 598 today. Barnes said underlying sales, excluding new stores, were growing strongly as it lured shoppers by introducing more fresh fruit and vegetables and British fresh meat. The company has attracted 800,000 new shoppers so far this year. The pace of growth for both Aldi and fellow German discounter Lidl has slowed over the past year, but Barnes said the no-frills chains would continue to take market share from traditional players such as Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons. \u2018It\u2019s not a temporary phenomenon. It\u2019s structural. It\u2019s a permanent shift in behaviour, as millions more people make a more informed choice about their shopping \u2013 a choice which means they can feed their families quality food while saving money,\u201d he said. Aldi\u2019s long-rumoured wine service will be the grocer\u2019s first move into internet retailing in Britain and will start in the first three months of 2016. Aldi will sell all of its in-store wines by the case on the internet and some wines will only be available online. In the second quarter of the year, Aldi will start selling non-food items, known as Specialbuys, online. These items, currently available in stores, range from cycling gear to power tools and Halloween outfits. It will offer customers a choice of home delivery or collection from pick-up points. Barnes said Aldi would be investing \u00a335m in the online launch: \u201cThis will enable us to introduce the Aldi brand and some of our bestselling, best quality and best value products to thousands more customers across the UK.\u201d Aldi said it had no plans to offer other groceries online at present as such moves had proved unprofitable and complex for other retailers and it needed to keep costs low to maintain its leading price position. Barnes said he did not expect Aldi\u2019s online operation to make much profit in the short to medium term but would be an \u201copportunity to learn\u201d about a fast-growing part of the market. Online growth has helped the UK\u2019s big four supermarkets \u2013 Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 to offset falling sales at large supermarkets caused partly by the growth of Aldi and Lidl. Online grocery sales are expected to be the fastest growing part of the UK market, more than doubling in value between 2014 and 2019 to \u00a317bn, to make up 8% of overall sales. Both Aldi and Lidl have used wine as a way to broaden their appeal to middle-class British shoppers looking for low prices. Lidl is also considering launching a wine website as a first move into internet retailing in Britain.",

      "bodyText": "Vodafone and Liberty Global, the US owner of Virgin Media, have ended talks about a possible exchange of assets, the UK mobile phone operator said. The companies, long rumoured as potential merger candidates, announced in June that they were in discussions about swapping some operations. Analysts said at the time that a deal could result in either Virgin Media or Vodafone\u2019s UK mobile network changing hands. This month, John Malone, Liberty\u2019s chairman, said the two sides were struggling to find common ground about what form a deal might take. In a statement on Monday, Vodafone said: \u201cOn 5 June 2015, Vodafone confirmed that it was in the early stages of discussions with Liberty Global regarding a possible exchange of selected assets between the two companies. Vodafone [on Monday] announces that discussions with Liberty Global have terminated.\u201d Vodafone and Liberty have overlapping businesses in Germany, the UK and the Netherlands. Malone had said a deal involving those countries could be attractive for Liberty, the world\u2019s biggest cable company. He said Liberty had no interest in some other Vodafone operations such as those in India and South Africa. Vodafone denied that the talks included the option of a merger but analysts said the UK firm could have raised \u00a330bn by selling its operations in Africa, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific to make a merger with Liberty possible.

      "bodyText": "More than 180 artists and arts organisations have signed a pledge never to take sponsorship money from oil companies, and will urge others to do the same. The signatories include the playwright Caryl Churchill, the cartoonist Martin Rowson, the artist Hans Haacke and the Royal Court and Arcola theatres in London. The \u201dfossil funds free\u201d pledge is part of a campaign that has been targeted mainly at Tate, the British Museum, the Royal Opera House and the National Portrait Gallery \u2013recipients of a five-year sponsorship deal with BP worth \u00a310m, which is due to end in 2017. Campaigners argue that such deals lend the oil company a cultural legitimacy, and that the arts organisations could get the money elsewhere \u2013 a claim that is vehemently contested. Each signatory to the pledge, being launched on Monday, will be able to use a \u201dfossil funds free\u201d logo on their work. Anna Galkina, of the campaign group Platform London, said: \u201cWe are asking [artists and organisations] to make two commitments: don\u2019t take fossil fuel sponsorship for their own work and secondly when they work with an organisation or partner who does, then raise the issue... challenge it.\u201d The BP sponsorship \u201cis really not that much money\u201d, argued Galkina. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown through a really lengthy freedom of information process that it represents half a per cent of Tate\u2019s total income. If the will was there, this money would be easy to replace.\u201d Tate argues that it represents about 20% of its sponsorship income for Tate Britain. The artist Raoul Martinez, twice nominated for the BP Portrait Award, said: \u201cFrankly I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s still going on. Climate change is the greatest moral challenge of our time, a threat to our species\u2019 very existence. Yet as we\u2019ve been hurtling towards climate catastrophe the fossil fuel industry has been working tirelessly to discredit the science, deceive the public, and slow down any meaningful political response.\u201d Judith Knight, director of ArtsAdmin, said the organisation had signed up \u201cin the belief that the positive force of the arts is undermined by the damage to the planet from fossil fuels. We would urge all arts organisations to join this movement and stop giving credibility to companies whose operations threaten our planet\u2019s future.\u201d Galkina said the support of Churchill and theatres such as the Royal Court was significant. \u201cI am really wondering what the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company are thinking right now,\u201d she said. BP is a corporate partner of the RSC, while Shell is a platinum corporate sponsor of the National Theatre. Arts organisations that take oil company money argue it is a vital part of their income. The director of the British Museum, Neil MacGregor has called BP \u201cby far our best corporate friend, certainly our longest-standing and most faithful corporate friend\u201d. He told the Guardian this year: \u201cFor the last 15 years or so BP have been a major factor in enabling the museum to be the museum it is today \u2013 putting on major exhibitions in London, sending them to the regions and operating internationally. \u201cWhat would you want companies to do with their profits? Do you want them to spend them in a way that benefits the public or not?\u201d BP says it is proud of its arts sponsorship, calling its sponsorship of the Tate, British Museum, Royal Opera House and National Portrait Gallery \u201cone of the most significant, long-term corporate investments in UK arts and culture\u201d. Other organsations that have made the pledge include the Red Ladder theatre company, Live Art Development Agency, Highlight Arts and Forest Fringe. Galkina said climate change talks in Paris in December added an extra incentive and she hoped the initial 180 names were just the first step, adding: \u201cWe invite people who love the arts, who love culture to get in touch with their favourite gallery or theatre and see if they will sign up... that is how this movement will grow.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In the past year, Australia\u2019s population grew more slowly than it has for nearly a decade. The slowing growth reflects the slowing of Australia\u2019s economy, as fewer migrants have been coming to Australia since the mining boom went off the boil at the end of 2012. And the moves within the country from one state to another also highlight that people who move to where the jobs are are no longer moving to the west. In the 12 months to March this year, Australia\u2019s population grew by just 1.35%. The last time it was that slow was in March 2006, and it sees the end of a nine-year period of very strong population growth: Compared with most other major advanced economies, Australia has had much greater population growth in the past decade. While smaller nations such as Luxembourg and Israel have had faster population growth, Australia is well out in front among OECD nations with populations of over 10 million: And while our birth rate has been quite solid, the main reason for the population growth is that people have wanted to come here to work and live. Because of the good fortune we have had in the past decade via the mining boom and our ability to avoid experiencing the Great Recession in the manner in which other nations did, Australia has been a place where jobs are available in a way that was not the case in places like the UK. But in the past year the level of overseas migration has fallen drastically. While in the 12 months to December 2012 there was a net migrant increase of 237,000 people, in the 12 months to March this year the increase was just 173,000: There has also been a quite significant drop in the natural increase \u2013 i.e. births minus deaths. In the 12 months to March the natural increase was just 142,900, compared with a level of 162,700 observed a couple years ago. The fall in overseas migrants is mainly from two countries \u2013 New Zealand and the UK: Net migration from India and China has held up, and even continues to grow, if at a slower level than in the past. But the numbers coming across the Tasman is at its lowest for 10 years, and the 8,250 who came from the UK represents the lowest level recorded by the ABS. This drop in population growth is something that many economists have been looking at with respect to the unemployment figures. Given the ABS benchmarks its labour force survey against the population survey, marked changes in growth \u2013 especially across states \u2013 can make the data a bit screwy. And there certainly have been some big changes across the states. Since the start of 2014, Victoria has been the place to be. It has the highest population growth of any state \u2013 something that has not occurred in the past 35 years: As with the picture of Australia, the reason for Victoria\u2019s boom is not a greater number of births, but migration. However, in this case we are talking about interstate migration. On this score, comparing the net interstate migration of Victoria and Western Australia really tells the story of the Australian economy over the past decade: From 2003 onwards more people were moving to WA than leaving it, and conversely, more were leaving Victoria than moving to it. The reason of course was jobs. While AFL footballers like Patrick Dangerfield may move from South Australia to Victoria for family reasons (yes, I am an sad Adelaide Crows fan) most people move interstate to get work. And during the boom years, WA was the place to go to get work. But as I noted in June, now that is the place to leave. The number of unemployed per vacancy in NSW and Victoria has fallen significantly over the past two years, whereas it has risen in the west. The influx of people into Victoria has meant that, since 2013, for the first time this century, Victoria\u2019s population has grown faster than the national average: New South Wales, despite also having strong jobs growth, continues to have more people leaving the state than arriving. One possible reason may be the cost of housing. As I noted last week, since 2011, Sydney\u2019s housing prices have risen well above that of other cities \u2013 including Melbourne\u2019s. The influx of people into Melbourne would go some way to explaining its recent upsurge in housing prices, and the fact more people are now leaving WA than going to it would also explain why Perth\u2019s housing market not only shows no signs of the boom of Sydney and Melbourne, but even has slight price falls. The overall decline in overseas net migration has been a somewhat natural response to our slowing economy. The decline, however, has also helped keep our unemployment rate lower than it otherwise would have been as it has meant fewer people in the labour market trying to get jobs. And, just as naturally, within Australia the transition from the mining boom, reflected in construction and investment growth shifting from the mining states to Victoria and NSW, is also happening with people. People follow the work, and for the first time in over a decade, the work is leading people to Victoria.",

Because of the good fortune we have had in the past decade via the mining boom and our ability to avoid experiencing the Great Recession in the manner in which other nations did, Australia has been a place where jobs are available in a way that was not the case in places like the UK.</p> <p>But in the past year the level of overseas migration has fallen drastically.</p> <p>While in the 12 months to December 2012 there was a net migrant increase of 237,000 people, in the 12 months to March this year the increase was just 173,000:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual population increase\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/hnjFm/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>There has also been a quite significant drop in the natural increase \u2013 i.e. births minus deaths. In the 12 months to March the natural increase was just 142,900, compared with a level of 162,700 observed a couple years ago. </p> <p>The fall in overseas migrants is mainly from two countries \u2013 New Zealand and the UK:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Permanent settlers to Australia\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dTeE3/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Net migration from India and China has held up, and even continues to grow, if at a slower level than in the past. But the numbers coming across the Tasman is at its lowest for 10 years, and the 8,250 who came from the UK represents the lowest level recorded by the ABS.</p> <p>This drop in population growth is something that many economists have been looking at with respect to the unemployment figures. Given the ABS benchmarks its labour force survey against the population survey, marked changes in growth \u2013 especially across states \u2013 can make the data a bit screwy. </p> <p>And there certainly have been some big changes across the states. </p> <p>Since the start of 2014, Victoria has been the place to be. It has the highest population growth of any state \u2013 something that has not occurred in the past 35 years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual population growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sbALQ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As with the picture of Australia, the reason for Victoria\u2019s boom is not a greater number of births, but migration. However, in this case we are talking about interstate migration. </p> <p>On this score, comparing the net interstate migration of Victoria and Western Australia really tells the story of the Australian economy over the past decade:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Nat annual interstate migration\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KGCaO/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>From 2003 onwards more people were moving to WA than leaving it, and conversely, more were leaving Victoria than moving to it. The reason of course was jobs. </p> <p>While AFL footballers like Patrick Dangerfield may move from South Australia to Victoria for family reasons (yes, I am an sad Adelaide Crows fan) most people move interstate to get work. And during the boom years, WA was the place to go to get work. But as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/29/unemployed-and-looking-for-work-whatever-you-do-dont-go-west\">I noted in June</a>, now that is the place to leave. </p> <p>The number of unemployed per vacancy in NSW and Victoria has fallen significantly over the past two years, whereas it has risen in the west. </p> <p>The influx of people into Victoria has meant that, since 2013, for the first time this century, Victoria\u2019s population has grown faster than the national average:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Annual population growth: Victoria, Western Australia, Australia\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vhO0K/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>New South Wales, despite also having strong jobs growth, continues to have more people leaving the state than arriving. One possible reason may be the cost of housing. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/sep/25/investors-have-reignited-the-fire-under-sydney-and-melbourne-house-prices\">I noted last week</a>, since 2011, Sydney\u2019s housing prices have risen well above that of other cities \u2013 including Melbourne\u2019s. </p> <p>The influx of people into Melbourne would go some way to explaining its recent upsurge in housing prices, and the fact more people are now leaving WA than going to it would also explain why Perth\u2019s housing market not only shows no signs of the boom of Sydney and Melbourne, but even has slight price falls. </p> <p>The overall decline in overseas net migration has been a somewhat natural response to our slowing economy. The decline, however, has also helped keep our unemployment rate lower than it otherwise would have been as it has meant fewer people in the labour market trying to get jobs. </p> <p>And, just as naturally, within Australia the transition from the mining boom, reflected in construction and investment growth shifting from the mining states to Victoria and NSW, is also happening with people. </p> <p>People follow the work, and for the first time in over a decade, the work is leading people to Victoria.</p>",
