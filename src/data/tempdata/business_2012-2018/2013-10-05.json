      "bodyText": "A half millennium of history will end on Friday when the government goes where even Margaret Thatcher dared not tread and privatises Royal Mail. In between divorcing and beheading wives, Henry VIII appointed Brian Tuke to the newly created role of \"Master of the Posts\" in 1516. The job was a forerunner to Postmaster General and the service \u2013 which for its first 119 years was reserved for royals to send letters between palaces \u2013 became Royal Mail. The postal service, the world's oldest, has remained in public ownership ever since, despite attempts by both the Tories' Lord Heseltine and Labour's Lord Mandelson to flog it and swell the nation's coffers. Thatcher, who sold off British Gas, British Airways, British Telecom and dozens of other state-owned institutions in the 1980s, drew the line at Royal Mail, saying famously that she was \"not prepared to have the Queen's head privatised\". But on 7am on Friday up to 70% of Royal Mail will be sold to investors and listed on the London Stock Exchange \u2013 swelling Treasury coffers by about \u00a32bn, though that will no more than dent the \u00a3115.7bn deficit the government ran up on the public finances last year. The government is pressing ahead with the sale despite fierce opposition from the public, politicians of all hues and Royal Mail's 150,000 postmen and women, who are planning days of debilitating strike action in protest. Vince Cable and Michael Fallon, the business secretary and business minister in charge of the sale, say that in these straitened economic times Royal Mail can no longer be owned by the state as it has to compete with schools and hospitals for much-need investment. Royal Mail needs to borrow hundreds of millions of pounds to prepare for a future delivering parcels ordered online from the likes of Amazon and Asos, rather than cards and letters that are dying out in favour of emails and messages on Facebook or Twitter. Letter traffic has dropped by a quarter over the past five years to just 58m items a day. \"It cannot be right for Royal Mail to come cap-in-hand to ministers each time it wants to invest and innovate,\" Cable said. \"The public will always want government to invest in schools and hospitals ahead of Royal Mail.\" Fallon has said that if Royal Mail were to remain in state hands \"every \u00a31 it borrows is another \u00a31 on the national debt. That means growing the national debt. No responsible party could propose that in the current environment, or for that matter in any environment, when Royal Mail \u2013 run on a fully commercial basis \u2013 has the capacity to be cash-generative, profitable and perfectly able to raise the capital it needs from the private sector.\" After years of heavy losses \u2013 \u00a3320m in 2010 and \u00a3258m in 2011 \u2013 Royal Mail is now steadily increasing its profits. In the latest accounts available, for the six months to September 2012, it made operating profits of \u00a3144m compared with \u00a312m a year earlier, while sales remained roughly flat at \u00a34.4bn. Royal Mail has also been given greater freedom to increase the price of stamps \u2013 over the past five years the price of a first-class stamp has risen from 41p to 60p \u2013 and is allowed to make a \"reasonable commercial return\" (a margin of 5-10%) on its universal service obligation to deliver to every address in the country six days a week, which the government promises will be maintained for the foreseeable future, no matter who owns the company. Royal Mail has also been freed of its \u00a312bn pension fund deficit by transferring the scheme from the company to the state, at a cost of \u00a31.3bn in the first year alone. City experts reckon these changes outweigh the threat of strike action and any political and public backlash and will make Royal Mail very attractive both to big banks and investment firms as well as the public, who are able to buy its shares as long as they can stump up a minimum of \u00a3750. Gert Zonneveld, managing director of stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said he expects the flotation to be a \"raging success\", with investors trying to buy up to 10 times as many shares as are available, But most of the demand, he said, is down to the \"exceptionally attractive\" value the government has placed on the shares. It has said they will be priced between 260p and 330p, giving the company a maximum market value of \u00a33.3bn. Zonneveld reckons the government's range represents an \"exceptionally good entry level for investors\", and said the shares should have been priced at up to 450p. \"I'm so convinced they [the government] got it wrong,\" Zonneveld said. \"I think they're more than \u00a31bn too low [in their valuation of the company].\" By comparing Royal Mail's profits and revenues to that of other listed postal services in other countries, Zonneveld thinks the company should be valued between \u00a33.7bn and \u00a34.5bn. Under his valuation, Royal Mail would join the FTSE 100 list of Britain's biggest companies, which means tracker funds would be forced to buy the stock, sending demand \u2013 and the price \u2013 even higher. \"I think this is going to be massively oversubscribed,\" he said. \"Institutional investors who want \u00a310m will increase their order to \u00a350m because they know their orders will be scaled back.\" He predicts that the share price could rise by 30% on the first day of trading on Friday. It means the government could lose out on about an extra \u00a3500m if it had priced the shares at 450p. The government has said it will not increase the price range above 330p no matter how high the demand for the shares. The expected jump in the share price could go some way to placating Royal Mail's 150,000 employees, who are in the midst of voting for nationwide strike action, the first since 2009, which cannot take place until 23 October. The government is giving employees 10% of the shares for free. If the shares at the top end of the government's 330p estimate,each employee will own shares worth \u00a32,200 on Friday morning. If they perform as Zonneveld predicts they could be worth \u00a32,860 by Friday afternoon. But even the prospect of nearly \u00a33,000 is not enough to win over most postmen and women. The Communication Workers Union, which represents 115,000 Royal Mail staff, says that 96% of employees are adamant in their opposition to the sell-off. \"I don't want the money,\" Theodore Mbungu, 56, said as he trudged about his north London round last week. \"I want my job to stay the same. When it's private we will be paid less and have to work harder. What other job is there where you talk to people every day and they are happy and smiling and excited to see you? \"In what other job can you do your work and then go straight home, even though you're still being paid? I love being a postman. It's the best job in this country, but I know once the men in the City get their hands on it, it will never be the same again.\"",

      "bodyText": "ScottishPower, one of the UK's big six energy companies, turned up the public heat on Labour leader Ed Miliband last week by warning that investment in new power stations will be endangered by his plans for a price freeze. But it was not just Labour that was coming under pressure. The industry's considerable lobbying powers were acknowledged at the Conservative party conference when the energy minister, Michael Fallon, referred to the sector's trade body, Energy UK, as \"one of the strongest and most well-argued lobbies there is\". But the real lobbying is going on behind the scenes, where the major players have a large network of individuals defending the sector's interests. Keith Anderson, chief corporate officer at ScottishPower, told Miliband in a letter released to the media that a freeze would foment doubts and create an atmosphere that would affect \"the appetite to invest\". But Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, was later peddling a more low-key line: \"We need a calm, considered debate and want to engage all parties and consumers in the discussion.\" The Labour party is wary of Knight, a former Conservative MP and until little more than a year ago chief executive of the British Bankers' Association. Bilateral talks are expected to take place between Miliband and each of the big six companies, with Knight kept at a distance. And one public relations adviser to the power companies said privately that the big six would now begin a behind-the-scenes cold war, rather than continue the open hostility: \"It would be a big mistake to wage a big campaign against this. It would make them look even more like pantomime villains than they already do. Instead, they will work quietly to do their very best, aided by the Murdoch press and others, to make sure Labour does not get in.\" The firms would also use the employees they have already placed on secondments in the heart of government, and their scores of public affairs experts, to reinforce the carefully cultivated impression that they were indispensable to the government's plans to create a low-carbon energy system, sources said. \"The Department of Energy and Climate Change [Decc] is under the strong impression that it cannot do the things it wants to do without the big six \u2013 it just simply doesn't believe it is possible,\" another lobbyist said. Current government policy, developed by the Conservatives while in opposition, was heavily influenced by two of the big six \u2013 EDF and British Gas-owner Centrica \u2013 according to industry sources: \"EDF and Centrica are now just an offshoot of Decc \u2013 they are all so in bed with each other they are indistinguishable.\" It was Centrica's chairman, Sir Roger Carr, who was most aggressive in his comments following the Miliband speech, arguing that a price freeze would lead to \"economic ruin\". Equally, Centrica is one of only three big six firms that has yet to respond formally to a Labour letter setting out its policy of a 20-month price freeze if Miliband were to win the 2015 general election. After the 2010 election, Centrica's chief executive, Sam Laidlaw, was appointed to David Cameron's business advisory council, while the prime minister's current energy adviser in Downing Street, Tara Singh, is a former Centrica employee. The source suggested that the same help in writing policy would be offered to Labour. Energy companies, including Centrica, EDF and RWE npower, have placed dozens of staff in government departments on secondments since 2008, either funded by the taxpayer or provided for nothing. (Civil servants also travel in the opposite direction and spend time in energy companies.) By the end of 2012 almost two dozen were in place in the energy department. Tom Burke, a former head of Friends of the Earth who worked as special adviser to several Conservative ministers, said: \"The secondments are pernicious, but the real power is how [the energy companies] shape the discourse through the media \u2013 that is where their many lobbyists do their real work. They constantly feed hard-pressed journalists lines their editors will like.\" The energy industry's access to ministers is shown by 195 declared meetings between Decc ministers and energy companies and their lobby groups in the 10 months after the 2010 general election alone. There were 17 meetings with green campaign groups in the same period. The heat on Miliband, Fallon and their parliamentary colleagues is clearly going to remain turned up.",

      "standfirst": "The 21-year-old was found dead in his flat after working for three nights in a row. For the first time, Moritz Erhardt's parents talk about how they had feared for their son \u2013 and why the British government must prevent another such tragedy", 
      "body": "<p>As a baby, Moritz Erhardt was a bad sleeper. His father, Hans-Georg, remembers the day of his son's birth, 3 October 1991, as one of the happiest moments of his life, but when he and his wife, Ulrike, took their newborn home, they found it hard to get him to settle. Like his father, Moritz suffered from neurodermatitis, a condition that left his skin covered with itchy sores.</p> <p>\"There were some really hard nights,\" recalls Hans-Georg. \"One of the things I remember was that when I tried to get Moritz to sleep, he was able to go to sleep with one eye open. I would sit by the side of the bed and he would look at me with one eye open, almost to see if I was still there.\" Did Moritz still have this ability as an adult? Hans-Georg gives a quiet shudder of laughter. \"I don't believe so.\"</p> <p>Even as a young man, Moritz's sleep patterns continued to be a cause of some concern to his family. Bright and handsome, Moritz had a tendency to work hard and to party with equal energy throughout high school and his first years at university. He had several short-term flings with girls and a large circle of friends. His father, a psychoanalyst and life coach, warned him about burning the candle at both ends but, like many young people, Moritz took parental advice with a large pinch of salt.</p> <p>His studies certainly never suffered. After school, he turned down a place at the London School of Economics, choosing instead to study at the <a href=\"http://www.whu.edu/en/\" title=\"\">WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management</a> in Vallendar, Germany, because it was more affordable (his degree was partly funded by the state, partly by an alumni bursary). He attended the University of Michigan for a term as part of an exchange programme. At Vallendar, he had his eye on a career in management consultancy before possibly doing some charity work.</p> <p>\"He wasn't just interested in the money,\" says Hans-Georg, 52, in his first newspaper interview. \"He wanted to do good in the world. I've been sorting through some of his things and I found a quote from Marilyn Monroe he'd made a note of which went, 'I don't want to make&#xa0;money, I just want to be&#xa0;wonderful.'\"</p> <p>Moritz wanted to get as much experience as he could. He started applying for internships in the world of corporate finance, completing placements at KPMG, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank. In July this year, he moved to London from his home town of Staufen near the Swiss border to take part in a summer internship with Bank of America Merrill Lynch that would pay him \u00a36,000. It was a highly competitive environment: Moritz had fought 1,500 other candidates to get one of two places in the investment banking division. The hours were brutal. Working through the night was almost a rite of passage.</p> <p>In August, Moritz was nearing the end of his seven-week placement. He had shown himself to be so capable that the bank was preparing to offer him a full-time job as a \u00a345,000 a year analyst after his graduation.</p> <p>But Moritz was unaware of this. Keen to impress to the last, he worked three nights in a row. Over a 72-hour period, he got a taxi back from the office to his flat in Bethnal Green, east London, at around 5am each morning. He would then shower briefly before returning to his desk. This exhausting ritual is known in banking circles as the \"magic roundabout\" \u2013 so-called because the taxi driver will sometimes wait outside while an intern washes, puts on a fresh shirt and re-emerges blinking in the dawn light.</p> <p>On Thursday 15 August, Moritz was caught on CCTV entering the Claredale House block of student flats, rented to hundreds of City interns during the summer. He never came out.</p> <p>At work that day, his colleagues at first thought Moritz might have slept in. He was a popular member of the team and they were willing to cut him some slack. But then there was a meeting Moritz was scheduled to attend at 2pm and he didn't turn up. As the day wore on, there was a growing sense of unease. In the evening, a fellow intern raised the alarm. His body was discovered at around 8.30pm. Moritz was sprawled across the shower floor, the water still running. He&#xa0;was&#xa0;21.</p> <p>In Staufen, Moritz's parents were sleeping. At 6.30am, there was a knock on the door. They woke immediately. Ulrike went to answer and found two policemen outside. \"She immediately knew what had happened,\" says Hans-Georg, \"because she was already very worried.\"</p> <p>In the days leading up to Moritz's death, his mother had noticed that he was often sending her emails at five or six in the morning. Her son had suffered \"a small number of epileptic seizures\" in the past and was on medication for the condition. Although the results of the postmortem are not yet known, Hans-Georg has his own theory about what might have happened. \"The lack of sleep caused a seizure and I think that, first in his room, and then in the shower, he had a seizure and then maybe he drowned under the running water because he was unconscious.\"</p> <p>When he speaks, it is with the hollow exhaustion of a father who has faced the unbearable, yet accepted that somehow it must be borne.</p> <p>Moritz's family \u2013 his parents and younger sister, Annalena, 19 \u2013 flew to London the following week with the intention of saying a final goodbye. When they arrived, they were advised not to view his body. \"They told us he had spent a long time under running water and that had changed him quite a bit,\" says Hans-Georg blankly.</p> <p>The staff at Claredale House had made an effort to tidy up Moritz's room, packing up his belongings \u2013 watch, mobile phone, notebook, laptop. Left to his own devices, Moritz could be messy, so there was a particular sadness for Hans-Georg when he saw how neatly arranged everything was.</p> <p>\"It was terrible to see it so orderly,\" he says. \"I broke down when I saw that because, on the one hand, I saw how nice they had made it and how nice it was for them to do that. On the other hand, it wasn't Moritz's room anymore.\"</p> <p>In the weeks that followed, the family were paralysed by grief. The shock was immense. And yet, speaking to Hans-Georg barely a month after his eldest child died from what he believes was exhaustion, he displays an astonishing lack of rancour.</p> <p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch has already announced a review into its working practices and Hans-Georg tells me that its staff could not have been more supportive in the aftermath of Moritz's death; that he does not blame them for not spotting the warning signs earlier; that if he were to feel anger, it would only be \"with Moritz for not having taken care of himself\".</p> <p>He can imagine, he says, that part of what Moritz loved about the work was the intensity and the esprit de corps that developed during those long days and nights in the office. He compares it to the endorphin rush experienced by long-distance runners or mountaineers who push themselves to climb further without oxygen. The bank wasn't exploiting his son, he insists. Instead, Moritz \"was exploiting himself\".</p> <p>But in such a frenetic labour market, where competition for jobs has become even more aggressive after the financial crisis and the subsequent spate of City redundancies, it is hard not to feel that such youthful ambition needs to be carefully monitored. An exceptionally driven 21-year-old, desperate to live up to his own high standards, would have done almost anything to succeed. He would, perhaps, have known that 61% of current graduates end up working for the company where they have been an intern. At 21, one has very little concept of one's own limits.

In Germany, everyone has the right to rest between shifts, from a trucker to a surgeon.\"</p> <p>He points out that Moritz's 2012 internship with KPMG in Frankfurt was less taxing in terms of hours because of Germany's strict employment regulations: \"I think he worked really hard there, but not so excessively [as he did in London].\"</p> <p>Moritz's untimely death threw light on the internship culture at some of the City's biggest financial institutions. There were stories about students being so tired they could barely speak, let alone meet a deadline. At Merrill Lynch, all-night working was a badge of honour \u2013 some interns showered in the in-house gym rather than going home. They were, it has been reported, expected to stay long after the senior bankers left, often doing the mundane tasks passed on by analysts \u2013 PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets and the like.</p> <p>The investment banking division was known to be particularly tough. Four hours' sleep a night was deemed to be around average. \"You have no life whatsoever,\" says one former intern. \"If you go home at 11pm, it is said you are 'giving up'. You have no hope of a job offer.\"</p> <p>One 21-year-old male intern with an investment bank was recently paid \u00a38,000 for a three-month term of duty and during that time, while living at home, he spent only \u00a3200. \"He was always working so he never had a chance to spend his money on anything,\" says a friend.</p> <p>None of the interns I speak to wants to be named and most of them do not want to talk at all. Some of them are still shaken by Moritz's death. Others are fearful of endangering their future career prospects. Many of them want to make it clear that, despite the long hours, they enjoy their stints working around the clock in the heart of the City. And there are perks, too, many of which Moritz enjoyed: cocktail parties, dinners and company cars.</p> <p>But with the benefit of hindsight, does Hans-Georg wish his son had made a different decision \u2013 that instead of flying to London to work himself into the ground in the hope of securing a job, Moritz had chosen instead to stay at home and enjoy the summer holiday with his family?</p> <p>\"No way,\" Hans-Georg says, eyes unblinking behind black-framed oval spectacles. \"No. Because he enjoyed it so much.\"</p> <p>Ulrike Erhardt describes her son as \"a darling\". He used to write her easy, fluent emails expressing his love with a rare candour. She has printed some of them out and saved them in a plastic folder, filled with her favourite memories. She shares them with me, apologising for finding it too upsetting to talk. One of the emails is dated 8 May 2011 and reads: \"Mummy, I love you more than anything in the world. You're the greatest and most admirable person I will ever meet.\"</p> <p>Hans-Georg says Moritz \"spread sunlight\" wherever he went. He had \"an easy nonchalance\" that defused tension. His two parents were unmarried when Ulrike became pregnant; as a result, Moritz and his younger sister took their mother's surname (not their father's of Dieterle). It was only after Moritz was born that the couple decided to marry. \"He brought people together,\" says Hans-Georg. \"Including his parents.\"</p> <p>With terrible symmetry, his death has achieved the same thing. \"We are even closer now than we were before,\" says Hans-Georg, who was overwhelmed by the many letters, phone calls and emails he received after Moritz's death. More than 500 people wanted to come to Moritz's funeral. In the end, his parents had to limit the number to 200.</p> <p>\"He had a brightness, a way of shining,\" says Hans-Georg, sipping on a glass of white wine in the bar of a hotel in Hamburg where we meet. He speaks to me through an interpreter, although his English is excellent and he can understand most of my questions without translation. Occasionally, when things get too hard to talk about, he excuses himself, puts on a leather jacket and goes outside to light a cigarette, cupping his hand to protect the flame from a chill wind blowing off the Elbe.</p> <p>\"Moritz had a lot of friends and, for instance, if there were people who were a little bit like outsiders, he was kind to them, he took care of them and helped them. It's hard to find the right words. I think charisma is one of the ones that comes to mind. He was ambitious but he was also playful\u2026 He was a very special person.\"</p> <p>When I say that his family must have been proud of him, Hans-Georg nods. \"Yes, I'm especially proud of how many people love him.\" He asks the interpreter to make sure I understand that he deliberately used the present tense.</p> <p>His parents insist they never put particular pressure on him to succeed. Hans-Georg found it \"almost scary\" when his son would come back from school with yet another A-grade and says Moritz was independent and self-motivated from an early age. It is telling that his father had no idea of the stringent selection process his son had undergone to get his Bank of America placement. He only found out after Moritz died.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-419107131\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380809089550/The-WHU-Otto-Beisheim-sch-004.jpg\" alt=\"The WHU-Otto Beisheim school in Vallendar, Germany, where Moritz Erhardt studied after turning down \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The WHU-Otto Beisheim school in Vallendar, Germany, where Moritz Erhardt studied after turning down a place at the LSE to save money.

Hans-Georg's ambitions for him were more modest. He quotes the lyrics of the Cat Stevens song Father and Son, saying he would have liked to see Moritz \"find a girl and settle down\". Now he will never get the chance.</p> <p>In the weeks after Moritz's sudden and shocking death, Hans-Georg has had time to mull things over. Sometimes, at night, he dreams of his son and an image will rise in his unconscious mind of Moritz standing by a door. He thinks about the last conversation they had, when he and Ulrike drove their son to the airport to catch his flight to London. There had been a trivial argument \u2013 something to do with luggage or packing, he can't remember. Hans-Georg had suffered from bouts of depression that summer and felt guilty about parting on a sour note.</p> <p>\"I hugged him to say goodbye and maybe it's only now looking back on it with everything that has happened, but I did have a strange feeling.

I had to step in, to organise the pressing things.\"</p> <p>The hardest thing for the family to deal with, he says now, was the media attention. Pictures of Moritz were cut and pasted from social networks and splashed across newspapers in the UK, Germany and America. One particular article on a German website prompted a stream of vitriolic comments from anonymous people saying they wished more bankers like Moritz had died, even comparing the 21-year-old to an SS officer for the joy he took in his work. It was claimed he modelled himself on Gordon Gekko, the character portrayed by Michael Douglas in the 1987 film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89165/wall.street\" title=\"\"><em>Wall Street</em></a>, whose mantra \"Greed is good\" embodied a certain kind of capitalist excess.

It was a joke.\"</p> <p>Again and again, Hans-Georg and Ulrike felt their son was misrepresented.

Over the last year, I have learned that complacency implies stagnancy.\"</p> <p>Moritz went on to list his achievements \u2013 a junior tennis championship title, a youth leader of Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and so on. But when I ask Hans-Georg about this, he smiles. \"I think he was being ironic.

As a parent who has faced the loss of a child, he tells me that one of the questions he has asked himself over the last month is: \"Why him?

His family took a short cruise from Hamburg to Oslo and marked the date quietly in private. They needed to get away, to be alone with their memories. They wanted to remember Moritz as he was before he died: a bright, shining young man with his future stretching ahead of him like a sunlit expanse&#xa0;of&#xa0;sea.</p>", 
      "bodyText": "As a baby, Moritz Erhardt was a bad sleeper. His father, Hans-Georg, remembers the day of his son's birth, 3 October 1991, as one of the happiest moments of his life, but when he and his wife, Ulrike, took their newborn home, they found it hard to get him to settle. Like his father, Moritz suffered from neurodermatitis, a condition that left his skin covered with itchy sores. \"There were some really hard nights,\" recalls Hans-Georg. \"One of the things I remember was that when I tried to get Moritz to sleep, he was able to go to sleep with one eye open. I would sit by the side of the bed and he would look at me with one eye open, almost to see if I was still there.\" Did Moritz still have this ability as an adult? Hans-Georg gives a quiet shudder of laughter. \"I don't believe so.\" Even as a young man, Moritz's sleep patterns continued to be a cause of some concern to his family. Bright and handsome, Moritz had a tendency to work hard and to party with equal energy throughout high school and his first years at university. He had several short-term flings with girls and a large circle of friends. His father, a psychoanalyst and life coach, warned him about burning the candle at both ends but, like many young people, Moritz took parental advice with a large pinch of salt. His studies certainly never suffered. After school, he turned down a place at the London School of Economics, choosing instead to study at the WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management in Vallendar, Germany, because it was more affordable (his degree was partly funded by the state, partly by an alumni bursary). He attended the University of Michigan for a term as part of an exchange programme. At Vallendar, he had his eye on a career in management consultancy before possibly doing some charity work. \"He wasn't just interested in the money,\" says Hans-Georg, 52, in his first newspaper interview. \"He wanted to do good in the world. I've been sorting through some of his things and I found a quote from Marilyn Monroe he'd made a note of which went, 'I don't want to make money, I just want to be wonderful.'\" Moritz wanted to get as much experience as he could. He started applying for internships in the world of corporate finance, completing placements at KPMG, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank. In July this year, he moved to London from his home town of Staufen near the Swiss border to take part in a summer internship with Bank of America Merrill Lynch that would pay him \u00a36,000. It was a highly competitive environment: Moritz had fought 1,500 other candidates to get one of two places in the investment banking division. The hours were brutal. Working through the night was almost a rite of passage. In August, Moritz was nearing the end of his seven-week placement. He had shown himself to be so capable that the bank was preparing to offer him a full-time job as a \u00a345,000 a year analyst after his graduation. But Moritz was unaware of this. Keen to impress to the last, he worked three nights in a row. Over a 72-hour period, he got a taxi back from the office to his flat in Bethnal Green, east London, at around 5am each morning. He would then shower briefly before returning to his desk. This exhausting ritual is known in banking circles as the \"magic roundabout\" \u2013 so-called because the taxi driver will sometimes wait outside while an intern washes, puts on a fresh shirt and re-emerges blinking in the dawn light. On Thursday 15 August, Moritz was caught on CCTV entering the Claredale House block of student flats, rented to hundreds of City interns during the summer. He never came out. At work that day, his colleagues at first thought Moritz might have slept in. He was a popular member of the team and they were willing to cut him some slack. But then there was a meeting Moritz was scheduled to attend at 2pm and he didn't turn up. As the day wore on, there was a growing sense of unease. In the evening, a fellow intern raised the alarm. His body was discovered at around 8.30pm. Moritz was sprawled across the shower floor, the water still running. He was 21. In Staufen, Moritz's parents were sleeping. At 6.30am, there was a knock on the door. They woke immediately. Ulrike went to answer and found two policemen outside. \"She immediately knew what had happened,\" says Hans-Georg, \"because she was already very worried.\" In the days leading up to Moritz's death, his mother had noticed that he was often sending her emails at five or six in the morning. Her son had suffered \"a small number of epileptic seizures\" in the past and was on medication for the condition. Although the results of the postmortem are not yet known, Hans-Georg has his own theory about what might have happened. \"The lack of sleep caused a seizure and I think that, first in his room, and then in the shower, he had a seizure and then maybe he drowned under the running water because he was unconscious.\" When he speaks, it is with the hollow exhaustion of a father who has faced the unbearable, yet accepted that somehow it must be borne. Moritz's family \u2013 his parents and younger sister, Annalena, 19 \u2013 flew to London the following week with the intention of saying a final goodbye. When they arrived, they were advised not to view his body. \"They told us he had spent a long time under running water and that had changed him quite a bit,\" says Hans-Georg blankly. The staff at Claredale House had made an effort to tidy up Moritz's room, packing up his belongings \u2013 watch, mobile phone, notebook, laptop. Left to his own devices, Moritz could be messy, so there was a particular sadness for Hans-Georg when he saw how neatly arranged everything was. \"It was terrible to see it so orderly,\" he says. \"I broke down when I saw that because, on the one hand, I saw how nice they had made it and how nice it was for them to do that. On the other hand, it wasn't Moritz's room anymore.\" In the weeks that followed, the family were paralysed by grief. The shock was immense. And yet, speaking to Hans-Georg barely a month after his eldest child died from what he believes was exhaustion, he displays an astonishing lack of rancour. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has already announced a review into its working practices and Hans-Georg tells me that its staff could not have been more supportive in the aftermath of Moritz's death; that he does not blame them for not spotting the warning signs earlier; that if he were to feel anger, it would only be \"with Moritz for not having taken care of himself\". He can imagine, he says, that part of what Moritz loved about the work was the intensity and the esprit de corps that developed during those long days and nights in the office. He compares it to the endorphin rush experienced by long-distance runners or mountaineers who push themselves to climb further without oxygen. The bank wasn't exploiting his son, he insists. Instead, Moritz \"was exploiting himself\". But in such a frenetic labour market, where competition for jobs has become even more aggressive after the financial crisis and the subsequent spate of City redundancies, it is hard not to feel that such youthful ambition needs to be carefully monitored. An exceptionally driven 21-year-old, desperate to live up to his own high standards, would have done almost anything to succeed. He would, perhaps, have known that 61% of current graduates end up working for the company where they have been an intern. At 21, one has very little concept of one's own limits. And life at that age is surely about testing boundaries, not adhering to them. Does Hans-Georg feel more could be done to ensure that big corporations have a duty of care towards their employees? Is the long-hours internship culture due an overhaul? \"I think it's in Merrill Lynch's own interests to make sure that such things don't happen any more,\" he replies. \"But the labour market has its own dynamics. In the context of globalisation, Merrill Lynch is just a small player and something needs to change. I do really hope the British government will now start revising working hours and employment laws. I think it's the government that has to pass the legislation. In Germany, everyone has the right to rest between shifts, from a trucker to a surgeon.\" He points out that Moritz's 2012 internship with KPMG in Frankfurt was less taxing in terms of hours because of Germany's strict employment regulations: \"I think he worked really hard there, but not so excessively [as he did in London].\" Moritz's untimely death threw light on the internship culture at some of the City's biggest financial institutions.

Four hours' sleep a night was deemed to be around average. \"You have no life whatsoever,\" says one former intern. \"If you go home at 11pm, it is said you are 'giving up'. You have no hope of a job offer.\" One 21-year-old male intern with an investment bank was recently paid \u00a38,000 for a three-month term of duty and during that time, while living at home, he spent only \u00a3200. \"He was always working so he never had a chance to spend his money on anything,\" says a friend. None of the interns I speak to wants to be named and most of them do not want to talk at all. Some of them are still shaken by Moritz's death. Others are fearful of endangering their future career prospects. Many of them want to make it clear that, despite the long hours, they enjoy their stints working around the clock in the heart of the City.
