      "bodyText": "When Mothercare opened its first store in 1961 a \"baby travel system\" was still better known as a pram and Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, was still in short trousers. Today the maternity and parenting market it serves is unrecognisable thanks to the aggressive expansion of the major supermarkets and internet home shopping \u2013 as well as savvy members of Mumsnet scanning the message boards for money-saving tips. This week will see life get even harder for Mothercare \u2013 struggling, but still the market leader \u2013 as Kiddicare, the website backed by supermarket giant Morrisons, opens the first of a new wave of superstores. \"Shoppers will be wowed by the massive choice of product,\" says Kiddicare's chief executive, Scott Weavers-Wright, of the Nottingham store which opens on Wednesday. \"Mothercare are next door with 10 to 15 pushchairs, but you'll walk into Kiddicare and see 350.\" The government-backed Money Advice Service estimates that, even without childcare, a new baby can cost up to \u00a37,200 in its first year, making new arrivals more expensive than the family car and a lucrative area for hard-pressed retailers. Due to the breadth of the market, which takes in childrenswear as well as nursery furniture and toys, estimates of its worth vary. Childrenswear offers the biggest prize, with sales of nearly \u00a35bn, while Kiddicare is focused on the \u00a31bn baby equipment market \u2013 although a Morrisons childrenswear brand called Nutmeg is in the offing. Last year Morrisons snapped up family-owned Kiddicare for \u00a370m in a bid to attract more families with young children. The grocer does not punch its weight with these high-spending, frequent shoppers, and it upped the ante by picking up 10 superstores from retreating US electricals chain Best Buy to expand Kiddicare's physical presence. Like the newborns it is supposed to cater for, Mothercare has been the source of sleepless nights for its investors. The company has lost more than two thirds of its stock market value in the past two years and Simon Calver, the new chief executive appointed in April, has been charged with a major turnaround; last year the company fell to a loss of \u00a3102.9m. The retailer is accused of chasing overseas glory \u2013 it has stores in 59 countries including Nigeria and Kazakhstan \u2013 but forgetting about shoppers at home, losing its competitive edge on pricing and letting customer service deteriorate. While Mothercare was gallivanting across Asia and Africa, its home market got more sophisticated. Today, babies have gyms, not just dummies, and manufacturers of top-end strollers sell accessories such as \"paparazzi shields\" for celebrity offspring. The US tradition of baby showers has also gained traction: retailers such as John Lewis offer premium services like wedding-style gift lists for newborns. With many parents determined to give their children the best, new retailing names have also prospered. Last year upmarket nursery brand Mamas &amp; Papas, founded in 1981, reported turnover of \u00a3135.2m with, and a spate of openings took the Huddersfield-based chain, started by married couple Luisa and David Scacchetti, to more than 60 stores. A trawl through Mumsnet's notoriously charged message boards shows almost universal approval for the shopping experience offered by Kiddicare \u2013 although one customer is less complimentary on its own website (\"my pre-order item is still not here and would like my money back\"). The Nottingham store boasts a buggy \"test track\", a VIB (\"very important baby\") personal shopping service and community rooms to host showers and baby massage classes. Weavers-Wright promises a \"non-pushy\" atmosphere: \"We've created some community areas so mums can hang out for two or three hours \u2026 we want them to do that.\" With customers armed to the hilt with information, thanks to price comparison and social networking websites, he admits the in-store Wi-Fi will mean customers can \"price-check as they browse\". Over at Mothercare, Calver is not due to update the City until November, but there are early signs of the direction the former Lovefilm boss plans to take. A newly refurbished store in Edmonton, north London, offers all manner of bells and whistles, with \"diddly dance\" sessions for fractious toddlers and an ultrasound studio offering 4D baby scans. Mothercare is also sorting out its basic commercial housekeeping, matching rivals' prices and, given the straitened economic climate, introducing a value range that includes children's T-shirts for \u00a32.50 and jeans for \u00a36. Weavers-Wright confirms that shoppers, whatever their income, are increasingly looking to save money: \"Customers who want to buy an expensive Stokke high chair or pushchair continue to do so but there has been a gradual movement to own brand, value ranges.\" Kiddicare's expansion threatens to do more harm to Mothercare than good for Morrisons. With annual sales of around \u00a350m, the website is a sideshow for the Bradford-based grocer. It is grappling with loss of market share at its supermarket, which has sales of \u00a317bn. Shore Capital analyst Darren Shirley, who rates Morrisons a sell, has reservations about the direction chief executive Dalton Philips is taking it in, with the new upmarket look developed for its stores possibly alienating poorer shoppers. \"It is a very big business \u2013 and it will take time for some its other growth avenues to become meaningful and shift the dial.\"",

    "webTitle": "Olive oil prices to soar after Spanish drought devastates crop", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A fresh oil crisis is brewing. However, this time it won't be hitting the garage forecourts but the nation's kitchens. The wholesale price of extra virgin olive oil has jumped 62% in three months after a severe drought in Spain, the world's largest producer, wiped out an estimated 600,000 tonnes of production. Filippo Berio, the UK's biggest olive oil supplier, has warned that it will be forced to pass on the increase to consumers. \"The [wholesale] prices are going up rapidly daily,\" said Walter Zanre, managing director of Filippo Berio, which sells 10m litres of oil a year in Britain. \"It's very difficult to buy olive oil because they [the growers] are waiting for it to go up even higher next week. You're looking at \u00a32,800 per tonne [of extra virgin olive oil].\" Zanre said the extent to which the increase in costs is passed on to shoppers, is \"the million dollar question\". He said: \"I would say 25% now, but if we had had this conversation 10 days ago I would have said 10% to 15%.\" The average 500ml bottle of supermarket brand olive oil currently costs about \u00a32, while a 500ml bottle of Filippo Berio oil sells for \u00a33.39. \"We are torturing ourselves because our product will go over the psychologically important \u00a34 barrier,\" said Zanre. \"This isn't a 5% blip, we can't tighten our belts and absorb it.\" Consumers who can't bear the thought of going without olive oil are advised to stock up before the price rise hits. Zanre said supermarkets have a \"virtual embargo on retail price increases\" in the runup to Christmas, so now would be the time to get your supplies in for 2013. Thomas Mielke, director of Oil World, a trade journal that tracks oil prices, said the staggering price rise results from an \"unprecedented decline\" in stocks, particularly in Spain. Spanish olive trees have been hit by drought and an unexpected frost in the flowering season in spring. This has led to trees producing less fruit and the olives that have grown are less juicy than normal. \"The fruit can be shrivelled and not looking normal, much smaller in size, which means they produce less oil,\" Mielke said. The poor crop, due to be harvested in October, comes a year after Spain returned its best crop in years, causing an olive oil glut and a steep fall in prices that left many growers on the breadline. Spain is by far the most important country involved in olive cultivation and accounts for almost half of worldwide supplies. \"Whatever happens in Spain causes massive changes in the world price,\" said Vito Martielli, senior oil seeds analyst at Rabobank International. \"Last year, Spain had a very good season and produced 1.4m tonnes of olive oil, but this season it is expected to be less than 1m. The total global olive oil production is 3m tonnes a year.\" Martielli said the average price of olive oil of all qualities has increased from \u20ac2,200 a tonne in July to \u20ac3,200 a tonne last week. The drop in supply comes as demand for olive oil is at an all-time high with new countries developing a taste for the Mediterranean staple. Miekle said: \"Olive oil consumption is in the middle of a long-term increase in consumption. While it has reached saturation point in Spain and Italy, countries like the US and Australia are relative newcomers and are using much more olive oil.\" A rising number of the British are also turning to olive oil, according to Zanre. \"The appetite is growing continually,\" he said. \"There's a bit of a love affair with it among the chattering middle classes, but other people are consuming it too.\" He said the average Briton consumes half a litre of olive oil a year, far below the 14 litres a head in Italy, the world's biggest consumer.",

The London-listed pizza firm that controls the Domino's franchise in the UK and Ireland is expanding fast. It bought out the Swiss franchisee at the end of August and investors are looking for news on how the integration is going.</p> <p>Over at Compass, which is updating the market ahead of full-year results on 21 November, the company's already significant overseas activities seem to have insulated it from the UK's depressed economy. Panmure Gordon analysts point out that the share price has risen nearly 40% in the last 12&#xa0;months, comfortably outperforming the 16% increase in the FTSE 100. Time to crack open the champagne and foie gras?</p> <p><em>Au contraire</em>. Compass announced last month that it had decided to remove the livers of force-fed geese from its menus. The change will have affected its smattering of upmarket eateries, including those run by Gary Rhodes, whose signature dishes had included fillet steak burgers topped with melting foie gras. But profits are unlikely to be affected, given Compass does much of its business in school and hospital canteens and is perhaps more famous for once dishing up Turkey Twizzlers.</p>", 
      "bodyText": "As the ink dries on the 539-page judgment handed down last week to settle the seething row between Russian tycoons Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, the British legal gravy train this week returns once more to fellow feuding oligarchs Michael Cherney and Oleg Deripaska. Once again the dispute turns on whether past payments and disputed historic contracts amounted to one oligarch promising a slice of his empire to the other, or whether, in fact, the money flows were evidence of krysha payments \u2013 that is, protection money.

Last year he took home nearly \u00a31.3m including base salary of \u00a3490,000 and a bonus of \u00a3662,000. The annual report states that this year's bonuses will have clawback provisions, although it also says dismissal could see the boss claim \"all of the bonus which would have become payable up to the date of notice being served by the company\". Perhaps a pay consultant could explain. Food firms get hungry Food companies Compass and Domino's Pizza Group are also due to shuffle into the City canteen this week. The London-listed pizza firm that controls the Domino's franchise in the UK and Ireland is expanding fast. It bought out the Swiss franchisee at the end of August and investors are looking for news on how the integration is going. Over at Compass, which is updating the market ahead of full-year results on 21 November, the company's already significant overseas activities seem to have insulated it from the UK's depressed economy. Panmure Gordon analysts point out that the share price has risen nearly 40% in the last 12 months, comfortably outperforming the 16% increase in the FTSE 100. Time to crack open the champagne and foie gras? Au contraire. Compass announced last month that it had decided to remove the livers of force-fed geese from its menus. The change will have affected its smattering of upmarket eateries, including those run by Gary Rhodes, whose signature dishes had included fillet steak burgers topped with melting foie gras. But profits are unlikely to be affected, given Compass does much of its business in school and hospital canteens and is perhaps more famous for once dishing up Turkey Twizzlers.",

      "bodyText": "When George Orwell created Big Brother, he was thinking of a pervasive state rather than of Tesco. Supermarkets and other private sector organisations trying to know everything about us is a relatively recent development, although there is hope for the resistance movement yet: I have first-hand knowledge that, according to Tesco's intelligence network, our family retreat in Snowdonia does not exist. Where Tesco is better informed is in providing chapter and verse for what most of us already suspect: writing in the Financial Times, Philip Clarke, the retailer's chief executive, tells us that \"Britons are economising in ways I have never seen in my 30 years in grocery retailing\". Now, I have no doubt that the chief executive of Tesco did not get where he is today without a shrewd grasp of business. Unfortunately, like many business executives, he apparently thinks he has the answers to the British economy's problems too. He tells us that \"families across Britain are trying to live within their means. The coalition government must do the same \u2026 The most important question of our time is how government can improve people's lives without simply borrowing more money.\" Well, the answer is that it can't. There is no alternative for a government in this position but to borrow its way out of recession until it restores the economy to a decent rate of growth, at which point it can then begin to reduce the deficit and begin to live within its means. The point is that \"means\" can be physical as well as monetary. The British economy is operating way below its potential. Millions of people are unemployed. Hundreds of thousands are \"employed\" but only part-time and would like to work more. As the Harvard economics Professor Larry Summers pointed out in a recent Policy Network lecture, now available in a pamphlet, the British economy is suffering from a huge deficiency of demand. An extra percentage point of growth over five years would reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio by about seven or eight percentage points. This is consistent with the point I made a few weeks ago based on the findings of the late Bank of England chief economist Christopher Dow: in order to emerge from major recessions, economies need a prolonged fiscal stimulus lasting years. As it is, we now have a chancellor, and a nation, facing the worst of both worlds: an austerity programme that deters investment in both the public and private sectors, contributing to a flatlining economy where \u2013 because there is negligible growth \u2013 the deficit is not coming down as promised anyway. Speculation about the forthcoming December autumn statement centres on whether the chancellor will acknowledge that he is missing his targets, or will drive the economy further into the ground in the mistaken belief that he will set his deficit reduction programme back on course. But, wait a minute: we are told, by none other than my old friend Sir John Major, that there are signs of the \"green shoots\" of recovery. Sir John's return to the news pages may just have something to do with the promotion of his new book My Old Man: A Personal History of Music Hall. Now, a word of explanation: last weekend saw the 20th anniversary of Black Wednesday, remembered by many of us as the low point of Major's premiership; but I gather, and not from Tesco, that the younger generation has no idea what Black Wednesday was, many of them no doubt thinking it is a film by Quentin Tarantino that they happen to have missed. In fact it was the day that the pound was forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism, the precursor to the euro. It was a black day for a government that had invested so much political capital in the project, but dubbed \"White Wednesday\" by my journalist colleague Anatole Kaletsky, because it released the economy from the imprisonment of an overvalued exchange rate and the excessively high interest rates that were necessary to preserve that exchange rate. The phrase \"green shoots\" of economic recovery was used \u2013 rather prematurely, some of us thought \u2013 by the then chancellor, Norman Lamont. But recovery did come in due course, and in an atmosphere of buoyant world trade, a competitive exchange rate and low interest rates, the economy eventually recovered and the budget deficit came down. We are nowhere near such a recovery now. Monetary easing as practised by the Bank of England is all very well, but despite all the publicity devoted to quantitative easing, the figures for credit growth, or the lack of it, are appalling. The British economy needs from its chancellor neither a further dose of fiscal contraction nor a grudging acknowledgement that minor adjustments are required. It needs a change of macroeconomic strategy, of the sort that encourages growth \u2013 and might even benefit Tesco.",

      "bodyText": "Far from green shoots bursting forth, Lee Hopley, chief economist of manufacturers' group the EEF, sees a shadow falling over British industry. \"It feels like the mood has shifted down over the last quarter: the dark clouds do appear to be gathering,\" she says. Recession in the eurozone, the slowdown in China and the risk that America is heading for a \"fiscal cliff\" are all making exporters nervous, while demand at home remains relatively weak, she argues. The latest official figures showed that manufacturing output in July was 0.5% lower than a year earlier \u2013 though recent surveys show a modest pick-up in confidence. Individual manufacturers echo Hopley's assessment. \"There's been no further drop-off in demand; but if we saw any further drop-off, the patient would be dead,\" says James Greenham, managing director of EMS Physio, which sells hi-tech equipment for physiotherapists from its base just outside Oxford. \"I certainly don't see any uplift in business for the UK,\" he says. Many of his products are for export, which makes EMS exactly the sort of manufacturer Vince Cable is trying to encourage; but Greenham says most markets are seeing a slowdown. \"There's still demand from certain parts of the world \u2013 the Middle East and Asia \u2013 but I'm not aware of any country where the distributor is saying, 'things are brilliant'.\" Having lost out on an \u00a38,000 NHS contract to an overseas rival, Greenham would like to see the government using its procurement budget to back British firms. For Andrew Churchill, the managing director of precision engineering firm JJ Churchill, based in Leicestershire with 130 employees, the situation changes depending on which part of his industry you look at. \"We're seeing a very mixed picture,\" he says. In defence, lead-in times are so long that orders are still bouncing back from the recession of 2008-09. \"We made massive reinvestment during the recession ... and we're well placed to benefit from the recovery.\" When it comes to the parts his firm manufactures for giant diesel engines, though, business has declined by a third; yet the civil aerospace business is still \"brisk\", as is the car industry, where the expansion of Jaguar Land Rover, for example, has had knock-on benefits throughout the supply chain. Churchill would like to see the government take kick-starting growth more seriously. \"From my perspective, I support Osborne's fiscal mandate, and I think the deficit is very important; but we haven't seen any effect with regards to stimulating growth: there's an economic mandate that's missing.\" Green shoot rating \u2605 Banking By the end of this month, Royal Bank of Scotland will have paid \u00a32.5bn in fees for the insurance it bought from the government to insure its most toxic assets. Three years after joining the asset protection scheme, the bailed-out bank is expected to withdraw from it in the coming weeks after surviving the downturn without having to make a claim on the policy that played such a vital role in keeping it afloat in the dark days of the crisis. That is one green shoot, perhaps, for a banking industry that was brought to its knees four years ago when Lehman Brothers collapsed. But as Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, points out, it is hardly a major step, given that the taxpayer will still be left with an 81% stake in the Edinburgh-based bank. That stake, which once stood closer to 84%, has only been falling because the bank is issuing new shares to outside investors, thereby diluting the government stake. Similarly, the taxpayer stake in Lloyds Banking Group has fallen to just below 40% as a result of the issue of new shares. It is hardly a healthy picture, but in the past two months the share prices of many banks have enjoyed a minor rally \u2013 a sign perhaps that the worst may be over for an industry that has more recently been saddled with scandals ranging from attempting to rig the Libor rate to laundering money for drug barons in Mexico. Yet the launch of the Funding for Lending programme by George Osborne, aimed at getting more credit into the economy, is further evidence that the banking industry is still not functioning normally. Lending by banks to small businesses has continued to decline. The Federation of Small Businesses last week said that 42% of firms seeking loans were being turned down. Meanwhile, BDRC Continental's quarterly SME Finance Monitor found that only 43% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) used external finance such as a bank loan, compared with 51% just three months earlier. The moribund state of the lending market has prompted critics of the banking industry to call for greater state control. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott says: \"There can be no sustainable green shoots while the big banks, and critically RBS, are starving small firms of finance\". RBS and Lloyds are already subject to major restructuring programmes to reduce their riskiness. This is a positive sign, while the low interest rate environment is helping to keep bank's provisions for bad debts down, despite an economic environment that should suggest an increase of customers in trouble. But for banks, there is not much sign that their businesses are growing. \"Things might be getting less worse,\" says Gordon \u2013 but he adds that any improvement is \"based on falling bad debts and costs and not on a revenue story\". Green shoot rating \u2605\u2605 Hotels At the 16-room Sea Spray hotel near Brighton's seafront, where a bed for the night can cost anything from \u00a349 to \u00a3285 (if you opt for the Manhattan penthouse with whirlpool bath) Simon Etheridge is feeling festive. \"We've already taken a booking for Christmas this morning,\" he says. During the long, soggy summer of sport, there were apocalyptic anecdotes of hotels and restaurants standing empty as Brits stayed at home to watch the Olympics and overseas visitors avoided the country because of warnings of transport chaos. Earnings from foreign visitors to Britain were 6% lower in July than the same month last year; but there are hopes that business will pick up in the autumn. In Brighton, Etheridge insists, \"business has been great\". In the West Country, Nicci Clarke of One Three Nine 139, an upmarket bed-and-breakfast in Bath, also says that trade this year has been \"quite good actually\" \u2013 and she's already taken some advance bookings for Boxing Day onwards. Alessandra Pino, of the Italian restaurant Locanda Locatelli in London, says business was good even during the Olympics, and she too is upbeat about December. \"The Christmas season is normally when the restaurant is at its fullest and we expect this year to be no different.\" But not everyone is so confident: Anthony Flinn of Anthony's restaurant in Leeds says it's been a \"very hard year,\" with the number of diners up, but total takings down, as customers economised. One reason for optimism is that inflation has been falling steadily, from its peak above 5% last autumn to 2.5% in August. That should help to ease the squeeze on families' finances, which has been restraining spending \u2013 and which the Office for Budget Responsibility has cited as one of the key reasons for repeatedly downgrading its growth forecasts. Wages are rising at an average rate of less than 2% a year, according to the Office for National Statistics, so real incomes are still declining; but a marginally slower squeeze may still help tempt consumers to loosen their purse strings, and pop out for a family meal, or a weekend break. As Flinn says, \"we live in hope\". Green shoot rating \u2605\u2605\u2605 Housing market George Osborne's radical Funding for Lending scheme, offering cut-price state-backed loans to the banks, is directly aimed at cutting the cost of mortgages for ordinary borrowers. It was only launched last month, but with employment picking up in some parts of Britain, estate agents are reporting a more positive mood abroad. David Baker of David Baker &amp; Co in the Vale of Glamorgan says the local housing market is the \"best it's been for three years\". In Exeter, Hannah Edge of Strutt and Parker says business was quiet during the summer as potential house-hunters stayed at home to watch the Olympics. With the Games out of the way, however, she says, \"the last two weeks have been busier\". Philip Hiatt, boss of Your Move Philip Hiatt in West Sussex, echoes her assessment, saying: \"September has been a lot busier than the summer.\" He adds that the property market is \"not as bad as it is perceived\". So far there is little sign that cheaper loans and stronger levels of business in high street estate agents are feeding through to house prices, however. While the average cost of a London home has continued to rise, buoyed by strong demand from foreign buyers looking for a safe haven from the turmoil in the eurozone, in most parts of the UK prices are moving sideways or falling. The latest Nationwide house price index showed prices down 0.7% on a year earlier in August. The regional breakdown, last published in June, showed prices falling in nine of 13 regions nationwide. In Wales, the cost of an average home fell by 5.3% in the year to June, for example; in the north-west, there was a 4.3% decline. Ed Stansfield, property economist at consultancy Capital Economics, warns that shaving a few tenths of a percentage point off the interest rate on mortgages is unlikely to get the stalled housing market moving. Banks still have billions of pounds of loans on their books from the boom years that they fear may not be paid back in full, as prices continue to drift downwards. \"Their attitude is, 'I'm not going to do anything that isn't as close to 100% safe as it can be,'\" he says \u2013 hence the large deposits many lenders are demanding from first-time buyers. \"Since Funding for Lending was announced, there has been a steady downward movement in mortgage rates,\" says Ray Boulger of mortgage broker John Charcol. But he warns that new borrowers are unlikely to rush into the market unless banks loosen their loan criteria. Green shoot rating \u2605\u2605\u2605 Retail The recession was \"like a kick in the teeth\" for Birmingham florist Bal Baines and he was not alone. The collapse in consumer spending sparked by the financial crisis took a heavy toll on the high street. Almost one in seven stores are now lying empty. The survivors are leaner, meaner and fighting for their share of a retail market that is expected to shrink 1% in 2012. After the \"worst couple of years ever\", Buttercups and Daisies, Baines's shop, is now on the way up and has branched out online: \"Businesses have to adapt,\" he says. At the moment the messages coming from the big high street retailers, a good guide to consumer spending, point to fragile \u2013 albeit stable \u2013 consumer confidence. Updating the City earlier this month, Next boss Lord Wolfson was grim after a disappointing August and September: \"If the economy had a weather forecast, the outlook would be overcast \u2013 patchy rain for the foreseeable future.\" Rival store group Debenhams had more reason to be cheerful after an uptick in sales during the summer months, but its chief executive Michael Sharp was cautious: \"I think you are a very brave man at this stage to be predicting any form of green shoots. \"This is going to be a long haul.\" There was also reassurance from the mighty Philip Green, owner of Topshop, who said he felt the retail market had stabilised: \"I don't think it's got any worse \u2026 it's flattened, it's bottomed, now we've got to rebuild it.\" Everyone is now looking forward to Christmas. For most retailers it is the most important quarter of the year, as it is when they bank the lion's share of their annual profits. Seymour Pierce analyst Kate Calvert thinks the prospect of inflation rising again will continue to overshadow consumer confidence: \"We expect a subdued trend in spending to continue over the next two months with consumers saving ahead of Christmas.\" Lucia Martin, from independent toy store Bubbles and Squeak in York, says sales are 10% down on last year but is optimistic ahead of its busiest season: \"If we're lucky it will be the same as last year.\" Green shoot rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605",

Many of his products are for export, which makes EMS exactly the sort of manufacturer Vince Cable is trying to encourage; but Greenham says most markets are seeing a slowdown.</p> <p>\"There's still demand from certain parts of the world \u2013 the Middle East and Asia \u2013 but I'm not aware of any country where the distributor is saying, 'things are brilliant'.\"</p> <p>Having lost out on an \u00a38,000 NHS contract to an overseas rival, Greenham would like to see the government using its procurement budget to back British firms.</p> <p>For Andrew Churchill, the managing director of precision engineering firm JJ Churchill, based in Leicestershire with 130 employees, the situation changes depending on which part of his industry you look at. \"We're seeing a very mixed picture,\" he says.</p> <p>In defence, lead-in times are so long that orders are still bouncing back from the recession of 2008-09. \"We made massive reinvestment during the recession ... and we're well placed to benefit from the recovery.\"</p> <p>When it comes to the parts his firm manufactures for giant diesel engines, though, business has declined by a third; yet the civil aerospace business is still \"brisk\", as is the car industry, where the expansion of Jaguar Land Rover, for example, has had knock-on benefits throughout the supply chain.</p> <p>Churchill would like to see the government take kick-starting growth more seriously. \"From my perspective, I support Osborne's fiscal mandate, and I think the deficit is very important; but we haven't seen any effect with regards to stimulating growth: there's an economic mandate that's missing.\"</p> <p>Green shoot rating \u2605</p> <h2>Banking</h2> <p>By the end of this month, Royal Bank of Scotland will have paid \u00a32.5bn in fees for the insurance it bought from the government to insure its most toxic assets. Three years after joining the asset protection scheme, the bailed-out bank is expected to withdraw from it in the coming weeks after surviving the downturn without having to make a claim on the policy that played such a vital role in keeping it afloat in the dark days of the crisis.</p> <p>That is one green shoot, perhaps, for a banking industry that was brought to its knees four years ago when Lehman Brothers collapsed.</p> <p>But as Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, points out, it is hardly a major step, given that the taxpayer will still be left with an 81% stake in the Edinburgh-based bank. That stake, which once stood closer to 84%, has only been falling because the bank is issuing new shares to outside investors, thereby diluting the government stake.</p> <p>Similarly, the taxpayer stake in Lloyds Banking Group has fallen to just below 40% as a result of the issue of new shares. It is hardly a healthy picture, but in the past two months the share prices of many banks have enjoyed a minor rally \u2013 a sign perhaps that the worst may be over for an industry that has more recently been saddled with scandals ranging from attempting to rig the Libor rate to laundering money for drug barons in Mexico.</p> <p>Yet the launch of the Funding for Lending programme by George Osborne, aimed at getting more credit into the economy, is further evidence that the banking industry is still not functioning normally. Lending by banks to small businesses has continued to decline. The Federation of Small Businesses last week said that 42% of firms seeking loans were being turned down. Meanwhile, BDRC Continental's quarterly SME Finance Monitor found that only 43% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) used external finance such as a bank loan, compared with 51% just three months earlier.</p> <p>The moribund state of the lending market has prompted critics of the banking industry to call for greater state control. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott says: \"There can be no sustainable green shoots while the big banks, and critically RBS, are starving small firms of finance\".</p> <p>RBS and Lloyds are already subject to major restructuring programmes to reduce their riskiness. This is a positive sign, while the low interest rate environment is helping to keep bank's provisions for bad debts down, despite an economic environment that should suggest an increase of customers in trouble.</p> <p>But for banks, there is not much sign that their businesses are growing. \"Things might be getting less worse,\" says Gordon \u2013 but he adds that any improvement is \"based on falling bad debts and costs and not on a revenue&#xa0;story\".</p> <p><strong>Green shoot rating </strong>\u2605\u2605</p> <h2>Hotels</h2> <p>At the 16-room <a href=\"http://www.seaspraybrighton.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Sea Spray hotel near Brighton's seafront</a>, where a bed for the night can cost anything from \u00a349 to \u00a3285 (if you opt for the Manhattan penthouse with whirlpool bath) Simon Etheridge is feeling festive. \"We've already taken a booking for Christmas this morning,\" he says.</p> <p>During the long, soggy summer of sport, there were apocalyptic anecdotes of hotels and restaurants standing empty as Brits stayed at home to watch the Olympics and overseas visitors avoided the country because of warnings of transport chaos. Earnings from foreign visitors to Britain were 6% lower in July than the same month last year; but there are hopes that business will pick up in the autumn.</p> <p>In Brighton, Etheridge insists, \"business has been great\". In the West Country, Nicci Clarke of <a href=\"http://www.139bath.co.uk/about_onethreenine.asp\" title=\"\">One Three Nine</a> 139, an upmarket bed-and-breakfast in Bath, also says that trade this year has been \"quite good actually\" \u2013 and she's already taken some advance bookings for Boxing Day onwards.</p> <p>Alessandra Pino, of the Italian restaurant <a href=\"http://www.locandalocatelli.com/\" title=\"\">Locanda Locatelli</a> in London, says business was good even during the Olympics, and she too is upbeat about December. \"The Christmas season is normally when the restaurant is at its fullest and we expect this year to be no different.\" But not everyone is so confident: Anthony Flinn of <a href=\"http://www.anthonysrestaurant.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Anthony's restaurant in Leeds</a> says it's been a \"very hard year,\" with the number of diners up, but total takings down, as customers economised.</p> <p>One reason for optimism is that inflation has been falling steadily, from its peak above 5% last autumn to 2.5% in August. That should help to ease the squeeze on families' finances, which has been restraining spending \u2013 and which the Office for Budget Responsibility has cited as one of the key reasons for repeatedly downgrading its growth forecasts.</p> <p>Wages are rising at an average rate of less than 2% a year, according to the Office for National Statistics, so real incomes are still declining; but a marginally slower squeeze may still help tempt consumers to loosen their purse strings, and pop out for a family meal, or a weekend break. As Flinn says, \"we live in hope\".</p> <p><strong>Green shoot rating </strong>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <h2>Housing market</h2> <p>George Osborne's radical Funding for Lending scheme, offering cut-price state-backed loans to the banks, is directly aimed at cutting the cost of mortgages for ordinary borrowers. It was only launched last month, but with employment picking up in some parts of Britain, estate agents are reporting a more positive mood abroad.</p> <p>David Baker of David Baker &amp; Co in the Vale of Glamorgan says the local housing market is the \"best it's been for three years\".</p> <p>In Exeter, Hannah Edge of Strutt and Parker says business was quiet during the summer as potential house-hunters stayed at home to watch the Olympics. With the Games out of the way, however, she says, \"the last two weeks have been busier\". Philip Hiatt, boss of Your Move Philip Hiatt in West Sussex, echoes her assessment, saying: \"September has been a lot busier than the summer.\" He adds that the property market is \"not as bad as it is perceived\".</p> <p>So far there is little sign that cheaper loans and stronger levels of business in high street estate agents are feeding through to house prices, however. While the average cost of a London home has continued to rise, buoyed by strong demand from foreign buyers looking for a safe haven from the turmoil in the eurozone, in most parts of the UK prices are moving sideways or falling.</p> <p>The latest Nationwide house price index showed prices down 0.7% on a year earlier in August. The regional breakdown, last published in June, showed prices falling in nine of 13 regions nationwide. In Wales, the cost of an average home fell by 5.3% in the year to June, for example; in the north-west, there was a 4.3% decline.</p> <p>Ed Stansfield, property economist at consultancy Capital Economics, warns that shaving a few tenths of a percentage point off the interest rate on mortgages is unlikely to get the stalled housing market moving. Banks still have billions of pounds of loans on their books from the boom years that they fear may not be paid back in full, as prices continue to drift downwards. \"Their attitude is, 'I'm not going to do anything that isn't as close to 100% safe as it can be,'\" he says \u2013 hence the large deposits many lenders are demanding from first-time buyers.</p> <p>\"Since Funding for Lending was announced, there has been a steady downward movement in mortgage rates,\" says Ray Boulger of mortgage broker John Charcol. But he warns that new borrowers are unlikely to rush into the market unless banks loosen their loan criteria.</p> <p><strong>Green shoot rating </strong>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <h2>Retail</h2> <p>The recession was \"like a kick in the teeth\" for Birmingham florist Bal Baines and he was not alone. The collapse in consumer spending sparked by the financial crisis took a heavy toll on the high street. Almost one in seven stores are now lying empty.</p> <p>The survivors are leaner, meaner and fighting for their share of a retail market that is expected to shrink 1% in 2012. After the \"worst couple of years ever\", Buttercups and Daisies, Baines's shop, is now on the way up and has branched out online: \"Businesses have to adapt,\" he says.</p> <p>At the moment the messages coming from the big high street retailers, a good guide to consumer spending, point to fragile \u2013 albeit stable \u2013 consumer confidence. Updating the City earlier this month, Next boss Lord Wolfson was grim after a disappointing August and September: \"If the economy had a weather forecast, the outlook would be overcast \u2013 patchy rain for the foreseeable future.\"</p> <p>Rival store group Debenhams had more reason to be cheerful after an uptick in sales during the summer months, but its chief executive Michael Sharp was cautious: \"I think you are a very brave man at this stage to be predicting any form of green shoots. \"This is going to be a long haul.\" There was also reassurance from the mighty Philip Green, owner of Topshop, who said he felt the retail market had stabilised: \"I don't think it's got any worse \u2026 it's flattened, it's bottomed, now we've got to rebuild it.\"</p> <p>Everyone is now looking forward to Christmas. For most retailers it is the most important quarter of the year, as it is when they bank the lion's share of their annual profits. Seymour Pierce analyst Kate Calvert thinks the prospect of inflation rising again will continue to overshadow consumer confidence: \"We expect a subdued trend in spending to continue over the next two months with consumers saving ahead of Christmas.\"</p> <p>Lucia Martin, from independent toy store Bubbles and Squeak in York, says sales are 10% down on last year but is optimistic ahead of its busiest season: \"If we're lucky it will be the same as last year.\"</p> <p>Green shoot rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p>",
