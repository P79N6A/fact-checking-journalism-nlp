      "bodyText": "Who would have thought that speaking to shoppers or actually visiting a shop would be a useful place to start for a regulator investigating a major high street deal? Well, that is what the Competition and Markets Authority appear to have belatedly discovered. The competition regulator has provisionally given the green light to Poundland\u2019s \u00a355m takeover of 99p Stores after an \u201cin-depth phase two investigation\u201d. This is a different conclusion to the CMA\u2019s phase one inquiry, in which it said it could force Poundland to sell off 80 stores as well as 12 forthcoming ones for the deal to be agreed. The CMA justified that ruling by claiming the deal would reduce competition in the \u201csingle price point\u201d market, with only Poundworld and Poundstretcher remaining as serious rivals. But this always seemed a bizarre decision given that Poundland sells more than 1,000 brands that are also stocked by supermarkets. The rise of the discount retailer has been one of the reasons the big four supermarkets \u2013 Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons \u2013 have struggled. A bigger Poundland could cause even more disruption for the leading supermarket chains, which still account for 75% of grocery sales, and it would have no incentive to slack off with other rivals such as B&amp;M also growing rapidly. This is what the independent CMA panel members in the phase two investigation have also concluded. A major difference from the original investigation appears to be that Philip Marsden, chair of the inquiry, and his team commissioned a face-to-face survey of more than 5,000 customers of Poundland and 99p Stores, and visited the stores themselves. This helped them to understand the shape of the high street and the habits of the modern shopper far better. It is reassuring that the CMA ultimately reached this conclusion and did not get in the way of the growth of an emerging company that is challenging the established order, at the same time as helping hard-pressed households. However, it is almost seven months since this deal was announced and untold millions have been spent on lawyers and advisers. A company without the determination of Poundland could have walked away from the deal after the CMA\u2019s initial ruling in April. Indeed, Jim McCarthy, the boss of the discount retailer, almost did. The whole process stills feels deeply unsatisfactory. The CMA is a fledgling organisation that replaced the Office of Fair Trading and Competition Commission last year. After this episode, it should reconsider the way it approaches deals. For example, surely the so-called phase one investigation should have conducted a far more thorough study before stating that it had concerns. If phase one had not happened at all, we would not even be having this debate. Poundland has got the result it wanted in the end, but deals in the future may not be as fortunate. Long haul ahead With market chaos around the world, it has been easy to miss that Britain\u2019s leading supermarkets are under pressure again. Tesco has now given up all the gains it made after Dave Lewis unveiled his turnaround plan in January, while new figures from Markit show that Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons are the most shorted stocks in the FTSE, with more than 16% of their shares on loan. Tesco shares have fallen by 25% since hitting a peak in April, partly due to fears that it will raise less money than hoped from asset sales. However, the main reason supermarket shares are falling again is that a recovery in sales simply has not materialised. The latest market share data from Kantar shows Tesco sales are down 0.9% year-on-year, Asda sales are 2.5% lower, and Morrisons is 1.1% down. Sainsbury\u2019s sales have grown 0.1%, but this is still well behind the 18% recorded by Aldi and the 12.8% growth of Lidl. The chief executives of the big four supermarkets have committed hundreds of millions of pounds to cutting prices, but they are still losing market share to the discounters. The supermarkets have claimed that their sales are being dragged down by deflation and they should start to grow again when inflation returns, probably early next year. Well, deflation may have compressed the market, but it has not stopped Aldi and Lidl. Britain\u2019s leading supermarkets face a long, tough journey back to sales growth, let alone a world where Tesco made a 6% profit margin. That journey has barely begun.",

    "webTitle": "ASA orders Morrisons to clarify price comparisons under loyalty card scheme", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Morrisons has been ordered by the advertising watchdog to clarify the way it compares prices with other supermarkets under its Match &amp; More loyalty scheme following a complaint from rival Aldi. After a 10-month investigation, ASA told Morrisons it must clearly tell customers where they could get details on how points relating to the scheme had been awarded for a specific shop, including which products from their shopping list had been compared with which competitor. Morrisons\u2019 chief executive, David Potts, has said the loyalty scheme, which has been criticised as too complex by analysts, is under review. Potts, who joined the supermarket in March with a brief to revive its fortunes after a dive in sales and profits, wants to focus effort and resources on improving basics like ensuring shelves are well stocked and improving service. Aldi made four complaints about the way Morrisons had advertised the loyalty scheme, while the public raised a fifth issue. The ASA dismissed four of the complaints: that Morrisons could not compare some products because they were too different and that it did not make clear three elements of the scheme; that a \u00a315 minimum spend was necessary; that credit would be awarded in points not cash; and that the points were awarded for the overall difference on an entire shop not individual items. \u201cWe concluded that the ads did not misleadingly omit information or give a misleading impression of how the price-match scheme worked,\u201d the watchdog said in a 13-page ruling. \u201cWe further concluded that, because Morrisons compared products that met the same need or were intended for the same purpose and the products were matched in line with consumer expectations and Morrisons\u2019 guidelines, the ads were not misleading and did not breach the [advertising] code on that basis.\u201d It added that Morrisons had demonstrated that the way it compared products had been consistently applied. Martyn Jones, corporate services director at Morrisons, said the ASA\u2019s decision \u201cconfirms the integrity of our price matching against our competitors including Aldi\u201d. The watchdog upheld one complaint made by Aldi and five members of the public, that Morrisons had breached the advertising code because it did not provide sufficient information for customers and competitors to verify its claim the loyalty card matched prices against Aldi, as well as Lidl, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda. While it conceded that Morrisons customers service department was able to provide shoppers with details about how their points had been awarded, it said this was not made sufficiently clear on its website. \u201cWe did not consider Morrisons had provided a clearly signposted facility for customers who had shopped with them to obtain readily, specific details of what products had been compared, and at what prices, to explain how the points total had been calculated,\u201d it concluded. The watchdog\u2019s ruling lays bare the highly complex procedures behind Morrison\u2019s loyalty scheme which was launched by former boss Dalton Philips in October as part of his attempt to fight back against Aldi and Lidl. The German discounters have hit Morrisons hard in its northern heartland. The Bradford-based retailer employs a company to check prices at Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Tesco online. It also sends people to check prices at Aldi and Lidl stores twice a week, as neither retailers sells goods online. Only items which were found to be available on the shelf in Aldi and Lidl stores and that were within 20% of the weight or pack size of a similar Morrisons product were compared. Aldi said it was pleased with the ruling. Tony Baines, the discounter\u2019s joint managing director of buying, said: \u201cOur own analysis shows that the Morrisons Match &amp; More scheme did not price match Aldi. In our view complex price promotions and price matching schemes of this nature are confusing, are not transparent and do not serve the best interests of consumers.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On day one the stock market fell by 13%. On day two it fell by a further 12%. On day three hopes were high the storm had blown over after equity prices recouped the previous session\u2019s losses. Let this be a cautionary tale. These figures relate not to the Shanghai Composite index in August 2015 but the Dow Jones Industrial Average in October 1929. Even in the most savage bear markets prices never fall in a straight line. Instead, within a downward trend big daily falls are punctuated by sizeable daily rallies. Events of the past few days conform to this pattern, at least in Europe. Shares in London, Frankfurt and Paris fell heavily on Friday and Monday, then recovered on Tuesday. For a good while, there was every indication that New York would follow the same pattern. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up more than 400 points at one stage only to suffer a bout of jitters in the last hour of trading to close more than 200 points lower. This is a bad omen. Markets were not over-impressed when China hit the panic button by both cutting interest rates and allowing banks to lend more money. Wall Street\u2019s late loss of nerve suggests there is a lot more turbulence to come, with attention firmly focused on China, where the authorities have given up intervening to prop up the stock market in favour of intervening to prop up the economy. The statement issued by the People\u2019s Bank of China pointed out that economic growth was facing \u201cdownward pressure\u201d, and there will be further easing over the months to come as the weaknesses of China\u2019s economic model become apparent. It is not just that the growth rate of the world\u2019s second biggest economy is faltering, it is that the quality of that growth is deteriorating. Mike Riddell of M&amp;G notes that the share of gross domestic product accounted for by investment rose from just over 40% in 2007, to 48% between 2008 and 2013, to 54% last year. A higher investment rate is normally associated with higher growth; in China\u2019s case it has been associated with lower growth. Riddell\u2019s conclusion is that much of the investment has been wasteful and that China is \u201ctrying to hit unsustainably high GDP growth rates by generating bigger and bigger credit and investment bubbles\u201d. The stock market bubble has now well and truly popped and the rebalancing of the economy away from over-investment has not yet begun. China\u2019s leaders cannot stave off a hard landing for ever. Indeed, the hard landing may already have arrived. This financial crisis is not over. The question is what impact it will have on the global economy. Optimists point to three reasons to be cheerful. The first is that the risks of financial contagion from China\u2019s stock market crash to the rest of the world are limited, because most losers will be Chinese companies and Chinese individuals. That\u2019s unlike the crash of 2007, when the whole world had bought into the US sub-prime boom. The second is that almost every recession since the second world war has been preceded by a sharp rise in oil prices, yet in the past year the cost of crude has more than halved. Third, the last really serious emerging market crisis in 1997 had no discernible impact on developed nations. Such optimism may be a bit premature. For a start, emerging markets are now a bigger part of the global economy. China represents 17% of world GDP once differences in the cost of living between rich and poor countries are evened out, and has accounted for almost 30% of global growth since 2010. The low oil price reflects the fact that some big emerging market economies are in recession and are exporting that recession to the west. Finally, developed countries responded to the 1997 crash by slashing interest rates. That option is unavailable this time.",

Shares in London, Frankfurt and Paris fell heavily on Friday and Monday, then recovered on Tuesday.</p> <p>For a good while, there was every indication that New York would follow the same pattern. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up more than 400 points at one stage only to suffer a bout of jitters in the last hour of trading to close more than 200 points lower.</p> <p>This is a bad omen. Markets were not over-impressed when China hit the panic button by both cutting interest rates and allowing banks to lend more money. Wall Street\u2019s late loss of nerve suggests there is a lot more turbulence to come, with attention firmly focused on China, where the authorities have given up intervening to prop up the stock market in favour of intervening to prop up the economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/08/dow_jones_1929-zip/giv-30080HPYx93KV2Esm/\" data-alt=\"The Dow Jones in 1929\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/08/dow_jones_1929-zip/giv-30080HPYx93KV2Esm/\">The Dow Jones in 1929</a> </figure>  <p>The statement issued by the People\u2019s Bank of China pointed out that economic growth was facing \u201cdownward pressure\u201d, and there will be further easing over the months to come as the weaknesses of China\u2019s economic model become apparent. </p> <p>It is not just that the growth rate of the world\u2019s second biggest economy is faltering, it is that the quality of that growth is deteriorating. </p> <p>Mike Riddell of M&amp;G notes that the share of gross domestic product accounted for by investment rose from just over 40% in 2007, to 48% between 2008 and 2013, to 54% last year.

      "bodyText": "You can follow our new live blog here, as Asian markets open on Wednesday: The outcome of Tuesday\u2019s abortive US market rebound looked a lot like Monday\u2019s panicky back-and-forth, but with less drama: This time, the major indexes opened down, spent the day solidly up with a few hiccups here and there, and then abruptly plummeted starting at 3 pm Eastern without stopping until the bell. Here\u2019s our US business editor Dominic Rushe talking to Ken Goldstein, economist at the Conference Board, on the decline: \u201cSomebody woke up last Thursday and headed for the exit and a stampede was on. Now they are back again,\u201d said Goldstein. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say much about our financial geniuses.\u201d Goldstein said consumers could be affected by the stock market wobble, which could trigger a lack of confidence ahead of the all-important holiday season despite relatively good economic data on housing, jobs and manufacturing. \u201cThe more we scare the bejeezus out of the consumer, the more risk we face,\u201d he said. The morning rise comes after three days of falls on stock markets around the world that erased close to $3tn globally. It was universally hoped that Monday\u2019s falloff was simply an adjustment to declining fortunes in China, but with two days down, American markets and Chinese misfortune would seem to be linked more closely than many had hoped. This blog is wrapping up for the day, but our colleagues in Australia will be back for the open of the Chinese markets. Read our complete report on the abrupt reversal of fortune in the US financial world here. The Dow - 15,665, down 205.51 points, 1.29% S&amp;P 500 - 1,867.74, down 25.43 points, 1.34% Nasdaq - 4,506, down 19.76 points, 0.44% The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 have not had a good hour. After a day\u2019s worth of upward-trending trading, the market is looking a great deal like it will close right back down where it started in a few minutes - and it ended yesterday very low. Leading the charge downward in the Dow is major pharmaceuticals company Merck, off by more than 4.3%, with Verizon (down about 1.6%), another pharma company, Pfizer (down 1.8%), and Microsoft (down nearly 2%). Credit card giant American Express is down 1.65% today thus far and off by more than 21.09% year-to-date. The NASDAQ is still barely above sea level, up by 0.07%. Here is a term folks are likely to be learning for the first time today: \u201cdead cat bounce.\u201d The poor cat mentioned here is being enlivened by speculation after a long fall, but he is not likely to chase any more mice. Another: \u201cstop-loss order,\u201d an order to sell stock \u201cintended to save further loss than has already been incrurred.\u201d Netflix and Hecla Mining are two different dead cats picked by market prognosticators today, but it\u2019s interesting to note a preponderance of clean energy companies on those lists, as well: there are no fewer than three solar-powered felines toe-tagged by the skeptics at The Street. Folks objected to the explanation of stop-loss in the comments so I\u2019ve tried to make it a little clearer and opted for the dictionary definition instead. Everything\u2019s fine. A Goldman Sachs note dated late yesterday tells everybody to take a deep breath and not worry about a global recession, although the firm isn\u2019t wild about the dollar in 2015. \u201cWithin DM [developed markets, as opposed to EM - emerging markets], we have recommended being long Japan and Europe versus the US in local currency terms for most of the year.\u201d \u201cDespite the recent escalation of market concerns, our economics team caution against taking too big a global growth signal away from the weakness in China and its impact on commodity market weakness,\u201d wrote a team of researchers led by Peter Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer\u2019s team said they viewed growth in the US and Europe as fundamentally sound, but warned that China might indeed be suffering from longer-term instability. \u201c[T]he risks in China itself, and those directly tied to China, have no doubt risen,\u201d said the Goldman analysts. \u201cIn this regard, unlike the US and Europe, China has yet to adjust to make the necessary structural changes to re-balance its economy.\u201d An hour and a half to the market close and here\u2019s what the fundamentals look like: off the highs for the day, with the rally running out of steam. S&amp;P 500 up 1.21%, or about 23 points total Nasdaq up 2% (about 91 points) The Dow Jones Industrial Average up 1.34% (about 212 points) Major overperformers today: Best Buy, which had been riding the downward curve the same as the rest of the market and today jumped more than 14% on news that the Apple Watch would be sold there soon (and probably also on Cook\u2019s prediction below that electronics were still a solid bet in Asia, which in turn should bolster the rest of the market. Consol, a coal and gas mining company based in the Appalachians. Netflix, which was off yesterday, prompting some premature grave-dancing over the \u201covervalued\u201d shares (they\u2019re back to their standard over-value). Big losers on the market: Pepco a holding company for numerous local utilities around the mid-Atlantic US... ...and Exelon, with which it was not allowed to merge. Navient, which holds student loan debt and bought a large amount of it from Sallie Mae recently. A lesson from 538: please don\u2019t sell those shares you\u2019ve been holding on to at the first sign of trouble, or your loss will be somebody else\u2019s gain (actually maybe just ignore the whole thing). Case in point: Apple, which, like many other heavy-hitter stocks, traced a crazy-looking mountain range of buys and sells yesterday, closing down against the previous day at $103.15. Today it\u2019s already up 3.95%, and Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s mini-editorial on stock price and continuing opportunity in China looks pretty solid. Maarten Hooft of Quest Venture Partners, a Google veteran who specializes in early-stage startup financing, said that he tended to favor the long game: When people are panicking it\u2019s an interesting time to buy. I very much follow what Warren Buffet advocates, which is \u2018buy and hold.\u2019 The average length of time people own their stocks is what, maybe six months? I own mine for years. For me, I\u2019m like, \u2018Look, Facebook is still gonna be around. Apple is still gonna be around.\u2019 Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe chose Tuesday to make his first public address in eight years saying his nation\u2019s fortunes were tied to China, crisis or no crisis, Reuters is reporting. The government of Zimbabwe is \u201csigning key projects with China, covering energy, railways and telecommunication, water, mining, agriculture, and tourism,\u201d Mugabe told a crowd of both supporters and detractors. Chinese financiers have expressed unhappiness with their investments in Africa, the report said, and with many in China far less liquid now than they were a few weeks ago, investments in the developing world could easily land lower on their list of priorities. The \u201crallying\u201d US market only looks impressive if you forget that the selloff has been going on for quite some time. To wit, here\u2019s a one-day graph: And here\u2019s a graph of a little more than a month\u2019s worth of activity: A true \u201crally\u201d from that falloff would be a nearly vertical line. This great time-lapse of the Dow shows yesterday (on the left) against today (on the right): Monday\u2019s market jerked back and forth all morning before settling down, while today it held fairly steady up about 300 points until a recent spike. The market was briefly up far enough to put the points gains in the top 10 (see below) ... but not any more. This is Sam Thielman taking the reins. It\u2019s midday in New York and investors are casting about for something sturdy to buy - consensus picks include, oddly, Best Buy, the American brick-and-mortar electronics retailer, which is up 14.41% in trading today as of this writing. Paul Vigna over at the Wall Street Journal reminds us that the heftiest gain ever logged by the Dow Jones Industrial Average was just over eight points in 1933 - because there were only fifty-something points in the index then. From Dow Jones itself, a quick list of the biggest one-day gains (points, not percentage) in its history, the top of which is October after the beginning of the US housing market crisis: 10/13/2008 - 936.42 points, 11.08% 10/28/2008 - 889.35, 10.88% 11/13/2008 - 552.60, 6.67% 3/16/2000 - 499.19, 4.93% 3/23/2009- 497.48, 6.84% 11/21/2008 - 494.14, 6.54% 11/30/2011- 490.05, 4.24% 7/24/2002 - 488.95, 6.35% 9/30/2008 - 485.21, 4.68% 7/29/2002 - 447.48, 5.41% After Monday\u2019s slump, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has just posted its biggest rally in four years. The blue-chip index jumped 182 points by the close of trading, a gain of 3%, to 6081. That means that\u00a346.7bn has just been wiped back onto the value of the index, which shed almost \u00a374bn during Monday\u2019s rout. It ends a 10-day losing streak which had sent the Footsie 17% down from its record high in April. Copper producer Antofagasta led the risers, finishing up 8.7%, as China\u2019s rate cut helped to push commodity prices higher. It\u2019s a relatively small rise in historic terms, though, as this chart shows: Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet, says the City lost some of its fears over China today: The FTSE-100 has staged a significant turn around over the last 24 hours with investors moving back in after yesterday\u2019s punishing sell-off. The worst may not be over for China but at least for now, markets elsewhere seem happy to divorce themselves from activities in Beijing. Phew. Trading is over for the day in Europe, and the markets have stormed back from yesterday\u2019s rout. The FTSeurofirst 300 index has provisionally closed 4.4%, means it has clawed back almost all of Monday\u2019s rout. Some detail: The German DAX was up around 5.3% at the close The French CAC put on 4.4% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB gained almost 6%. Spain\u2019s IBEX jumped 4% Portugal\u2019s PSI20 jumped 4.7% Just getting the UK data now.... The Wall Street rally is picking up pace, with the Dow Jones industrial average pushing over 400 points or 2.5%. The S&amp;P 500 index is also up 2.5%, which means it is no longer in correction territory (10% off the recent high). On Monday, the VIX \u201cfear index\u201d was too fearful to index -- to quote the ever-quotable Matt Levine. That\u2019s because volatility was so extreme that the VIX (a measure of volatility!) couldn\u2019t be measured. But once things calmed down slightly, it hit worrying levels not seen since the dark days of 2009, closing at a four-year high. Today, though, the VIX is a less cowardly beast. It\u2019s down by 22% today, showing that US investors are less worried about the financial markets. The Athens stock market went on a tear today, finishing up almost 10%. Stock markets are dropping back from their earlier highs, but are still comfortably higher. The Dow is now up 272 points, or 1.7%. That would be pretty impressive, if it hadn\u2019t slumped by 588 points yesterday. And in the City the FTSE 100 is now up 130 points, or 2.2%, having shed 288 points yesterday. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says it\u2019s a fretful sign: As we head into the close we\u2019re already seeing today\u2019s rally start to lose some of its early steam, pulling back from the intraday highs, which is a bit of a worry given the strength of the recent declines. With that in mind we\u2019re probably going to need a few more days like today before we can be confident that we\u2019ve seen the lows. Investors may be recognising that a Chinese interest rate cut doesn\u2019t magically solve its economic problems, or mean that other central banks such as the Fed won\u2019t tighten monetary policy sooner or later. Encouraging news on the US economy - consumer confidence has hit a seven month high. The Conference Board\u2019s monthly survey of sentiment jumped to 101.5 this month, up from 91 in July. The present situation index, a measure of current conditions, hit its highest level since the last recesssion, at 115.1 from 104 in July. However, the survey was taken before China sparked global market panic, so people may be reassessing the situation now. Back in Europe, stock markets remain sharply higher today. In London, the FTSE 100 is up 2.6%, or 150 points. \u200eChina\u2019s decision to cut interest rates mid-morning had certainly calmed the nerves at the London offices of IG Index, the spread-betting and stockbroking group, From IG, David Hellier reports. The Chinese authorities acted after the markets closed in China, somewhat unconventionally as is becoming their wont. At IG there was a constant stream of television crews coming to film the drama of the trading floor but it seemed as if they had arrived late for the show. \u201cIt\u2019s the calm after the storm,\u201d one analyst said, with many wondering whether Black Monday will truly be a one-off correction to the financial markets rather than the beginning of something more sustained. The mood was composed as traders watched Wall Street open. \u201cYou got the sense yesterday that there\u2019s so much money waiting on the sidelines and that the US is struggling to move higher, \u201c says Chris Beauchamp. IG\u2019s senior market analyst, adding: \u201cYesterday was absolutely manic.\u201d Choice Hotels rang the opening bell for the New York Stock Exchange today - a scary day to do it after yesterday\u2019s blood bath. But it seems to be working out for them so far. The Dow was up more than 300 points in the first few minutes of trading. China\u2019s problems have clearly continued into Tuesday but the US has, generally, had nothing but reasonably good economic news in recent weeks. That continued today with a report from S&amp;P/Case-Shiller showing a slightly higher year-over-year gain in US house prices with a 4.5% annual increase in June 2015 versus a 4.4% increase in May 2015. Our US business editor Dominic Rushe reports: The global stock market panic appeared to be easing Tuesday as US markets opened up following a dramatic sell-off by investors around the world dubbed\u201cBlack Monday\u201d. The Dow Jones Industrial average rose more than 300 points in the first two minutes after the opening bell. On Monday the Dow crashed 1,000 points when it opened ending the day down 3.6%. The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.11% and the Nasdaq 3.49%... More here: Wall Street is putting the Black Monday selloff behind, and joining the rally which kicked off in Europe earlier today. The Dow just jumped by 392 points, or 2.4%, in volatile early trading, as New York traders welcome the news that China\u2019s central bank has cut interest rates. That means it has clawed back more than half of yesterday\u2019s rout, which wiped 588 points off the industrial average last night. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is also recovering quite strongly, up 1.6% in early trading It\u2019s quite a turnaround. Exactly twenty four hours ago, we were watching the Dow plunge by over 1,000 points. Shares are pushing higher on Wall Street, pushing the Dow Jones up 320 points now. That\u2019s a 2% bounce. Tech stocks are leading the rally, with Apple up 5.5%. Facebook has gained 4.78% The Dow Jones is up 185 points, or 1.1%, as trading gets underway. But it may take a few minutes to open fully..... The Wall Street opening bell is being rung right now. Here comes the rally! Wall Street authorities are preparing for a volatile opening, in a few minutes time. For the second day running they have invoked \u2018Rule 48\u2019, which allows trading to begin without a stock price being announced at the market open. That is designed to allow smoother trading. Unlike yesterday, though, authorities are bracing for a surge on the stock market, after China\u2019s central bank announced new stimulus measures. Europe\u2019s stock markets are on track to post their biggest jump since 2011, just a day after suffering their biggest loss in four years. Aanyone who took Monday and Tuesday off may wonder what the fuss was about.... What a busy 12 hours we\u2019ve had. And with America waking up, let\u2019s have a recap. China\u2019s central bank has slashed interest rates and allowed its banks to lend more money, in an attempt to prop up its economy. The stimulus move, which has driven shares higher worldwide, came after another day of heavy losses in Asia. In an unscheduled move, the People\u2019s Bank of China cut lending rates, and deposit rates, by 0.25 percentage points. It also cut the Reserve Ratio Requirement, a move which should increase liquidity in the economy. PBoC warned that the China\u2019s economy still faces downwards pressure, as it pledged to use the tools at its disposal to maintain liquidity levels. Economists say the move is meant to help China hit its growth targets, and also stem the panic that has gripped markets for days. Investors in Europe hailed the move, sending the main indices surging over 4% at one stage. Here\u2019s the state of play now: FTSE 100: up 172 points, or 3%, at 6072 German DAX: up 396 points or 4.1%, at 10044 French CAC: up 191 points or 4.3%, at 4574 Wall Street is expected to rally strongly when trading begins in an hour\u2019s time. Last night, the Dow Jones suffered its biggest one-day fall in four years, adding to recent losses this month: The PBoC\u2019s action came too late to prop up share prices in China today, where the Shanghai composite index plunged by another 7.6% to its lowest point since last December. Analysts believe that Beijing has given up supporting the stock market directly, leaving shares free to find their own level. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell another 4% to an 18-month low, in a day of wild swings in Asia. The selloff left \u201ceven the most hardened trader gasping for air\u201d, says Frederic Neumann, HSBC\u2019s co-head of Asian economics research team. And there were grim faces across Beijing\u2019s trading floors again, where investors spoke to The Guardian about the \u2018horrible\u2019 crash. Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary has warned that the US economy is too fragile to handle higher borrowing costs: Today\u2019s rate cuts are positive, but not nearly enough, says David Goldman of Reorient, an Asia-focused financial services group. Goldman believes the People\u2019s Bank of China is failing to communicate to the markets, telling Bloomberg TV that: The PBoC must do more and must explain what it\u2019s doing more. Goldman also believes that real interest rates are still too high for Chinese firms, despite today\u2019s rate cut. The People\u2019s Bank of China is also trying to fix a mess of its own making, argues Andrew Polk, senior economist at The Conference Board. He told Reuters that the PBoC just threw \u201ceverything but the kitchen sink\u201d at the crisis: Clearly the timing is all about the double-whammy of the stock market and downward pressure on the currency, both of which I\u2019d argue they brought on themselves. They stood back and watched while the stock market ran up, then had a ham-fisted response when it fell, that created the need for a correction but made it more difficult to react. China\u2019s central bank has two objectives - prevent the economy stalling, and stop the market crash getting worse. Tao Dong, chief regional economist at Credit Suisse, says: \u201cClearly, this is targeted at the falling stock market. \u201cChina needs extra liquidity to prevent systemic risks. But ultimately, fixing the economy is more important than fixing the stock market and advancing reforms is critical.\u201d (via Bloomberg) Reuters\u2019 Peter Thal Larsen agrees that the slumping stock market forced the PBoC\u2019s hand: China\u2019s decision to cut interest rates, and the reserve requirements on its banks, is driving shares higher across Europe. The main indices are roaring back and recovering most of Monday\u2019s losses, in a dizzying rally: Wall Street is expected to rally too, after the Dow shed 588 points yesterday. This is the fifth interest Chinese interest rate cut in the last 12 months, underlining how the People\u2019s Bank of China has been easing policy in the face of a slowing economy: The People\u2019s Bank of China also warns that the Chinese economy faces downward pressure, a recognition that the country is in a sticky patch. But with inflation still low, it is possible to use policy tools to lower borrowing costs. And that\u2019s why it just cut rates by 0.25 percentage points. China\u2019s central banks says it took action today to provide \u201clong-term liquidity\u201d and to help support the Chinese economy. The PBOC blames \u201cfluctuations in the foreign exchange market\u201d for causing a shortfall in liquidity, and vows to \u201cclosely monitor\u201d changes in liquidity and use various tools to keep it under control. Breaking News: China\u2019s central bank has cut interest rates in response to the market turbulence. The People\u2019s Bank of China has slashed benchmark interest rates by a quarter of one percent. That\u2019s not a huge move, but a very significant one given events of recent days. The PBOC has cuts the one-year lending rate to 4.6%, and the one-year deposit rate to 1.75%. It has also lowered the Reserve Requirement Ratio, which governs how much money banks can lend to the economy. Market had expected the PBOC to act over the weekend, so today\u2019s news is long-awaited.... European stock markets are pushing higher as the news breaks, pushing the main indices up over 3%. More to follow.... Today\u2019s UK newspapers are packed with coverage of the market slump, and a few puns too. Here\u2019s a round-up: What goes down, must come up again* * - this may not apply to Chinese stocks..... Back in London, the FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip shares is now up almost 2.9%, or 164 points, at 6065, as Turnaround Tuesday gathers pace. That means it has clawed back more than half of Monday\u2019s slump, which wiped off \u00a379bn from top shares. Confidence is bubbling, as investors see that Wall Street is expected to rally this afternoon. Mining shares, which were kicked around the trading floors on Monday, are now sitting proudly at the top of the risers. Traders may be calculating that this week\u2019s volatility means central banks will be more reluctant to tighten monetary policy, meaning the era of cheap money could last even longer. Matthew Ryan, Strategy Analyst at Ebury adds: \u201cThe drama and unpredictable scenes of \u201cBlack Monday\u201d may still be grabbing headlines and causing fear among investors, however, the impact could be good news for UK businesses. Yesterday\u2019s events will put additional pressure on the People\u2019s Bank of China to further devalue its currency, with a cheaper Yuan benefiting UK industries importing from China.\u201d But, one morning\u2019s rally doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re out of the woods. As mentioned earlier, markets can swing wildly..... China\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, has admitted that the country\u2019s stock markets suffered \u201canother nightmarish day\u201d on Tuesday. Xinhua says: \u201cThe losing streak in China came despite the government\u2019s decision on Sunday to allow pension funds to invest in the stock market.\u201d He Fan, the chief economist at Caixin Insight Group, tells Xinhua: \u201cThe continuous fall in the index in recent months indicates the economy is still bottoming out.\u201d Christopher Balding, a professor of finance and economics at Peking University\u2019s HSBC Business School, believes Beijing has given up supporting its stock market despite the huge losses of recent days (as Bloomberg also flags up). Prof Balding told my colleague Tom Phillips that stock brokers have now recognised that China has pulled away the safety net, triggering today\u2019s big selloff. \u201cIt appears as if the government has taken a very conscious decision that they are not going to plough any more money into the stock market. \u201cI remember talking in the early days [of the recent crash] to some brokers and they said they would see an enormous bulge of orders and they would all be 10% above the market. Now, I was talking to a couple and they just said there was just absolutely no buying interest.\u201d \u201cIt seems that the government has made a very conscious decision not to throw good money after bad and there is just no interest in the marketplace, in other investors continuing to prop up the stock market.\u201d If that policy doesn\u2019t change, Chinese markets could well keep falling until valuations become more attractive. And if the economy is weakening, this could take some time.... Billionaires have been hit hard by the market mayhem, writes Bloomberg\u2019s Devon Pendleton: Asia\u2019s richest person lost $3.6bn on Monday, the most among all billionaires worldwide, as China\u2019s stock markets had the biggest plunge since 2007 and a wave of selling spread across the globe. Wang Jianlin saw $2bn wiped from his stake in Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties Co., according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, after the Hong Kong-listed property developer tumbled 17 percent to its lowest level since it went public in December. Wang also lost nearly $1bn from his Shenzhen-traded Wanda Cinema Line Co., which fell by the exchange-exposed limit of 10 percent on Monday. His fortune stood at $31.2bn after the decline. Before anyone organises a whip round for the 1%, we should remember that the wealthy gained a lot from stimulus measures such as quantitative easing, as they already owned the assets whose value was driven up by QE. Policymakers in Beijing have suspended the policy of intervening in the stock market while they debate their next step, Bloomberg reports. This explains why Shanghai\u2019s market keeps slumping each day; investors begin the session hoping for an intervention, but then start panicking once the cavalry fail to turn up. Bloomberg says: Some officials argue that falling stocks will have a limited impact on the world\u2019s second-largest economy and that the costs of supporting the market are too high, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. Officials who back intervention say tumbling shares pose a risk to the banking system, the people said. The Shanghai Composite Index sank 15 percent over the past two days, extending a $4.5 trillion rout since mid-June that has shaken confidence among equity investors around the world. Chinese policy makers are trying to balance a pledge to loosen their grip on markets against the need to maintain financial stability amid the weakest economic expansion since 1990. Mining giants are taking steps to protect themselves from the slump in commodity prices, and fears over China\u2019s economy. BHP Billiton announced this morning it will cut its capital expenditure sharply, from $11bn this financial year to $7bn by 2016/17. It acted after seeing underlying profits shrink by 52%, as iron ore, coal, copper and petroleum prices slid. CEO Andrew Mackenzie warned that prices will remain volatile due to economic reforms on China, which prompted BHP to vut forecast for peak Chinese steel demand in a decade\u2019s time. The AAP newswire has more details. The City likes the news, driving BHP\u2019s shares up over 5% today. But it\u2019s a long-term blow to the communities in places like Australia, where BHP has large operations. If you\u2019re trying to work out how China\u2019s stock market turned sour so quickly, check out this timeline: Today\u2019s European rally is good news for investors (unless they \u2018shorted\u2019 the market), but it doesn\u2019t change the fundamental problems in the global economy. Nour Al-Hammoury, ADS\u2019s chief market strategist, explains: We have global deflation, concerns over the strength of the Chinese economy and an overheated equity market. He believes the market is facing \u201ca trust issue\u201d, and looking to central banks to throw another lifeline: A single intervention by any of the Central Banks is now likely to be of little use \u2013 there will need to be a coordinated response. Wall Street is expected to bounce back when trading begins in five hours time, after suffering its biggest falls in four years. Ahead of the open, ADS Securities are calling the Dow Jones industrial average up 374 at 16205 and the S&amp;P up 39 at 1932. Last night, we watched the Dow Jones index shed 588 points in a remarkably volatile session. Today could be lively too. It\u2019s no wonder that investors in Beijing are rattled. They\u2019re experiencing a wickedly volatile market, with shares tumbling sharply since hitting a record high in June. That bubble has now been firmly popped, and the Shanghai market has now suffered four big tumbles since - including the slumps yesterday and today. City investors are \u2018picking up the pieces\u2019 after yesterday\u2019s tumble, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEX, as European indices jump more than 2%. But this could unwind quickly if Beijing cannot get the situation in China under control, he adds: The Chinese central bank remains a bungling bit-player in this nightmare, instead of the reassuring white knight the markets need it to be, something that could cause losses to return if the same price-eroding fears over the bank\u2019s ineffectualness begin to creep in once again. Greece\u2019s stock market is joining the rally, up more than 5% after a nasty tumble yesterday: Political uncertainty in Greece has been weighing on European markets ,after prime minister Alexis Tsipras resigned last week to trigger snap elections. The left-wing group who broke away from Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party are now trying to form a government. But if that fails (as seems likely), Greece will head to the ballot boxes again, perhaps on September 20th. European stock markets are pushing higher, as Black Monday turns into Turnaround Tuesday. The FTSeurofirst 300 index, made up Europe\u2019s largest companies, is now worth \u20ac200bn more than on Monday evening. That sounds quite impressive, until you remember that \u20ac500bn was wiped off the index yesterday. And despite today\u2019s bounceback, investors should still be cautious. History shows that markets rarely move in a straight line for long; autumn 2008 saw many of the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest falls and rises. My colleague Fergus Ryan is in a trading room in Beijing, where small investors are shell-shocked as they watched share prices tumble again today. Fergus writes that many traders were intensely focussed on what no doubt were their plummeting fortunes. One middle aged lady said only: \u201cDon\u2019t bother me, I\u2019m trying to focus\u201d. An elderly man was more candid, saying: \u201cI lived through wars, but nothing as horrible as this.\u201d. The 82 year-old former worker wouldn\u2019t give his name, as \u201cI depend on the Communist party to put food on my table\u201d. The old man held his hands up in a handcuff gesture suggesting he wasn\u2019t free to talk, but he did have some candid things to say about their leadership. \u201cThe Communist party is awful, all my money is gone\u201d.... We\u2019ll have more from Fergus later. China\u2019s stock market has crashed to its lowest level since December 2014, in a fresh wave of panic selling. The Shanghai Composite index just closed, down 7.6% at 2,964 points, after another day of market turmoil and wild swings (as we\u2019ve been blogging for the last eight hours). It\u2019s the first time in 10 months that the index has been below 3,000 points, extending the slump that sent world markets reeling on Monday. Fears over China\u2019s slowing economy are being compounded by the realisation that Beijing authorities aren\u2019t stepping in to prop up the market. Zhou Lin, an analyst at Huatai Securities, says: \u201cThe mood of panic is dominating the market ... And I don\u2019t see any signs of meaningful government intervention.\u201d No wonder that Frederic Neumann of HSBC said traders were \u2018gasping for air\u2019 after the recent drama. Banks and mining giants are dominating the top risers on the FTSE 100 in early trading: Insurance firm RSA is up after receiving a revised takeover offer from its rival Zurich, showing that it\u2019s still business as usual in the City. Here we go again.... The FTSE 100 index has jumped by 102 points at the start of trading in the City, a gain of 1.7%, taking it back over the 600 mark. Other European markets are also rallying, with France and Germany up 1.7% and Italy gaining 2%. That recovers some, but not all, of yesterday\u2019s rout which wiped around 4% off the main indixes. And there are still fears that Europe\u2019s fragile recovery will be knocked hard by China. Augustin Eden of Accendo Markets explains: Steep slides in equity markets and fears of a China-led slowdown in emerging economies are upending hopes in much of Europe that strong global growth and a weak euro would boost the region\u2019s limp recovery. European stock markets open in a few minutes. The FTSE 100 is expected to rally, after shedding 288 points yesterday in its biggest one-day slump since 2009. China\u2019s benchmark stock market is being dragged deeper and deeper down, wiping 7.5% off the Shanghai composite index as more traders throw in the towel. Almost every share price has been hit today: \u201cThe recent turmoil has left even the most hardened trader gasping for air. And there\u2019s probably more to come.\u201d So warns Frederic Neumann, HSBC\u2019s co-head of Asian economics research, in a note to clients. He says investors are spooked by two factors -- China\u2019s faltering economy, and the possibility that the US central bank, the Fed, raises interest rates this year. That puts further cracks into the two main growth pillars for the world economy of recent years: Chinese demand (including commodities) and easy money,\u201d (via Reuters) Today\u2019s rout across the China markets shows that traders realise Beijing won\u2019t, or simply can\u2019t, prop up share prices. \u201cIt\u2019s panic selling and an issue of confidence,\u201d Wei Wei, an analyst at Huaxi Securities Co. in Shanghai, told Bloomberg. \u201cThe government won\u2019t step in to rescue the market again as it\u2019s a global sell-off and it\u2019s spreading everywhere now. It\u2019s not going to work this time.\u201d It\u2019s all looking rather ugly on the Chinese markets right now, as the stock market suffers more heavy losses. The Shanghai Composite index just fell through the 3,000 point mark for the first time since December 2014, as another wave of selling rips through the country\u2019s brokerages. Not that it\u2019s easy to sell shares right now. Trading in scores of companies have been suspended, after they fell by 10% -- the maximum allowed in one day. The Australian market has closed up. The main S&amp;P ASX200 benchmark finished 2.42% higher at 5,122.4 driven by the financial sector. As Angus Nicholson at IG put it, the bargains were just too good to resist. The buying opportunities in the ASX today were clearly far too tempting. Banks led the rise today, with the sector up over 4%. Ouch. Japan\u2019s main stock index, the Nikkei, has just closed at its lowest level in six months, shedding almost 4%. Just two hours ago, the Nikkei was up 1%, before worries swept the Asian markets again. Turnover on the Tokyo market has been very brisk, hitting the highest level since November 2014, Reuters says. Martin Farrer in Sydney handing over to Grame Wearden in London. Thanks for joining me. The rout is gathering pace again. The Shanghai Comp is down more than 6% while the Nikkei in Tokyo and the Hang Seng are also down in a wave of selling since the Chinese markets reopened after lunch. One or two markets are proving immune to such negativity, namely Australia, South Korea and Taiwan After a volatile session, the main Asian markets are suffering a late selloff. The Shanghai Composite index is now down by over 6%, with an hour\u2019s trading to go. That puts the index close to the 3,000 point mark, meaning it\u2019s now down by 6.5% this year. And Japan\u2019s market is having a wobble too, as trading draws to a close in Tokyo. Here\u2019s the picture across the Asian indices right now: Angus Nicholson at IG Markets in Sydney thinks we might be seeing some more realistic valuations in the Chinese markets, which is why they\u2019re lagging so much. He thinks the authorities \u2013 what he calls the National Team \u2013 have decided to step back from interventions in the wake of a recent meeting of senior leaders at Beidaihe He writes: Asian stocks obtained some respite after yesterday\u2019s brutal sell off. Chinese stocks continued their declines, initially opening down over 6%, paring this back to 2.8%, then pushing back to a 4% decline. What is increasingly clear is that the \u201cNational Team\u201d, the China Securities Finance Corporation (CSFC), have stopped their daily interventions. The post-Beidaihe consensus appears to be that this was costing the government too much money. Thus, the rallies we are seeing in Chinese markets may have more to do with better valuations than government intervention. Tricky business this. I\u2019m watching Bloomberg TV here in the office and the Shanghai Comp is moving downwards at a rapid rate of knots to \u2013 it\u2019s down 5.47% now. Other Asian bourses are being dragged down too \u2013 Tokyo, Hong Kong both in the red. The Australian market has performed the strongest today. CMC Markets chief strategist in Australia Michael McCarthy said: It is too early to say we are out of the woods. We might see a significant rally and a further significant sell-off. But, at the very least, we have seen a circuit breaker in that sour sentiment, and that should see markets in this region stabilise. If you\u2019re just waking up in Europe \u2013 or wherever else for that matter \u2013 it has been a volatile day of trading on Asia Pacific markets. Stock markets fell quite sharply at the opening this morning but \u2013 with the exception of the Chinese bourses despite a $24bn injection from the central bank \u2013 recovered strongly. However, as the Chinese markets come back from lunch (which is clearly not for wimps there) there are signs of the recovery beginning to weaken, especially in Japan where the Nikkei is back in the red. Anyway, the current state of play is this: Nikkei down 0.43% ASX200 in Australia up 2.42% Kospi in Seoul up 1.2% Hang Seng is up 0.5% (but heading south) Shanghai Comp is down 3.87% (an improvement on -6% earlier) BUT Wall Street futures are pointing up strongly For slightly more on this, the Guardian\u2019s Larry Elliott has written about how the selling on Monday showed what markets can look like when the stimulants \u2013 in the form of quantitative easing \u2013 wear off. Larry writes: Financial markets have gone cold turkey. For the past seven years, they have been given regular doses of strong and dangerous narcotics. The threat that the drugs will no longer be available has resulted in severe withdrawal symptoms ... On the day that QE was launched in the UK, 9 March 2009, the FTSE 100 stood at 3,542 points. Its recent peak on 27 April this year was 7,103 points, a gain of 100.5%. There is a similar correlation between the three rounds of QE in the US and the performance of the S&amp;P 500, which was up more than 200% during the same period. Here\u2019s the full article. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets in London is another who thinks this is a correction that is overdue rather than the harbinger of global meltdown. He thinks today may see a let up in the selling of recent days. While the moves in recent days have been quite alarming in their volatility when one looks back at the performance of stock markets over the last six years, perhaps the recent declines are long overdue. For the last six years investors have been spoilt by central bankers who have been extraordinarily successful in pushing stock markets to record highs with the use of large scale loose monetary policy, while the Chinese economy has been growing at a fairly decent clip. This steady growth was almost an unspoken truth until the middle part of this year as attempts by the Chinese central bank to stimulate a recovery in its own economic slowdown ran into the combined efforts of the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, whose policies have weakened their own currencies against the Chinese yuan, and in the process eroded China\u2019s competitiveness. In seeking to nudge its currency lower Chinese authorities appear to have triggered widespread concerns that all is not as well as previously thought with the world\u2019s second biggest economy, and in the process triggered a widespread reassessment of valuations in some of the most sensitive sectors to the business and commodity cycle. Back to commodities and they\u2019ve made a decent recovery today with the oil benchmarks up slightly. US crude was up to $38.67 after closing at $38.24 a barrel in New York on Monday night, its first below-$40 close since February 2009. Brent crude for October was at $43.13 a barrel after closing at $42.69 a barrel in London, its lowest level since March 2009. The Bloomberg commodity index, which tracks 22 raw materials, was up 0.58% to 86.3507, after losing 2.2% on Monday to close at its lowest point since August 1999. And bullish investor sentiment from the Mayne man. Trading in China and Hong Kong has stopped for lunch so things are quite calm. Seems like a good time to look at more reaction to what\u2019\u2019s been going on. The consensus is definitely towards the view that other markets are decoupling from any China contagion. This from Capital Economics is in that ballpark: The current panic is essentially \u2018made in China\u2019. The recent data from other major economies have generally been good and there is little to justify fears of a major global downturn. China\u2019s recent economic data suggest that growth remains sluggish, but are not weak enough to justify fears of a hard landing. Having said that, the S&amp;P VIX volatility index, otherwise known as the Fear Index, is heading north again \u2013 a bad sign. As my colleague Graeme Wearden explained yesterday, \u201cthe VIX tracks the prices of options on the S&amp;P 500, which are often used to hedge against potential losses. So a jump in the VIX shows that investors are getting scared...\u201d US futures are helping the market bounce back. The US market is headed for a 2% rise at the opening on Tuesday which has breathed life back into Asia today. Bargain hunting looks like it has helped lift Asian shares. The MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan is up 1.7% after an initial dip to three-year lows, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei index also erased most of its early losses after an initial drop of 4.3%. It\u2019s currently up 1.1%. Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, said: There appears to be buyback as many markets look oversold after panicky selling in the last few days. Even the shares that had little business ties with China were sold. Hang Seng up 1.28%. ASX200 up 2.19%. Kospi up 1.62%. However, China\u2019s markets are still being sold. The Shanghai Comp is down 4.33%. Morgan Stanley says shares in Australia\u2019s banks have further to fall despite the rally today. The banks have seen record profits on the back of the booming housing market in Sydney and Melbourne, but some observers believe they are overpriced even after the recent falls. Morgan reckons that the big four are still \u201con average, 12% above its bear case scenario\u201d. Thanks to Mike Janda of the ABC for this. And here is Stephen\u2019s piece. So much going on today that I missed it launching a few minutes ago ... One of our roving economics commentators, Stephen Koukoulas, has been looking at the market turbulence. His analysis will be online shortly but here is a taster: The savage market ructions of recent weeks and days are disconcerting. While not unprecedented, the quite staggering fall in share markets and commodity prices are threatening to undermine the global economy. For Australia, the news is particularly alarming. Australia\u2019s stock market has not performed well in recent years, lagging well behind the other markets. If the market ructions translate to an extended period of weak global growth, Australia\u2019s already dismal export performance will be hampered and the commodity price weakness will further undermine national incomes. Here\u2019s our first news take on the story today from our correspondent in Tokyo, Justin McCurry. Tony Abbott, the Australian prime minister, has become the latest politician to have his say. Not surprisingly, he is adopting the \u201cnothing to see here\u201d approach. He has urged Australians not to \u201chyperventilate\u201d over the slump on global share markets after receiving a briefing from the Reserve Bank governor, Glenn Stevens, and senior officials on Tuesday morning. I think it\u2019s important that people don\u2019t hyperventilate about these type of things. While the Chinese economy is slowing, the rest of the world economy does appear to be picking up. America is growing, not spectacularly but steadily. Europe certainly seems to have turned the corner ... and here in Australia, our fundamentals are strong. It\u2019s been a much better day so far with the major markets \u2013 except China \u2013 back in positive territory. Here are the main points: Despite big swings on the Asian markets the main indices are up. The Nikkei is up 1.1%; the ASX200 is up 2.99%; Hang Seng up 1.69%; Kospi in Seoul up 1.7%. The yen has begun to fall back against the US dollar. This will be welcomed in Tokyo where the finance minister, Taro Aso, has called for action from China. But the Shanghai Composite is down 3.74% China pumps $25bn into the markets but there\u2019s still not the massive intervention some expected or even further cuts in bank reserve ratios. The Australian dollar is up 1.25 buying US72.22 cents Even some commodities like copper, which have had a fearful kicking in recent weeks, are up. And Goldman Sachs says the global economy is not heading for recession. Goldman Sachs has moved in to steady the ship. The global economy is not at risk of a recession, it says. Thanks to Reuters, here is what Goldman\u2019s experts said in a note to clients: The drop in commodity prices during the past year and recent economic and foreign exchange weakness in China and other emerging markets will not tip the global economy into recession. But the Wall Street bank reduced its short-term outlook for the equity market to \u201cneutral\u201d. It also maintained its view that commodities will underperform. We see a meaningful risk that markets are overinterpreting the collapse of oil and commodity prices as a negative growth signal. The fall in prices of oil and other commodities are primarily a reflection of excess supply rather than weak demand. On the sea of red v sea of green debate, the answer is, of course, that red is an auspicious colour in Chinese culture, indicating wealth. Thanks to Tom Phillips, our man in Beijing. Things are still improving on the main indices. Even the Nikkei has returned to positive territory, up slightly by 0.12%. And yet, sentiment remains quite negative in Shanghai, where the Composite Index is still off 4.6%. Zhou Lin, an analyst at Huatai Securities, doesn\u2019t see any sign of government intervention: Global investors are cannibalising each other. Calling it a market disaster is not an overstatement. The mood of panic is dominating the market ... And I don\u2019t see any signs of meaningful government intervention. Bear or bull? A good up-summing of the market dilemma by the Australian stock exchange\u2019s chief, Elmer Funke Kupper. He has told Australian Associated Press: There are two schools of thought. One is this is a correction that was probably a little bit overdue. There is another school of thought that says maybe the world economy is not recovering quite as well as everybody had been thinking and therefore we\u2019re more into bear territory. I think it\u2019s actually very difficult to call, and so you see these gyrations when people are getting worried about these things. Funke Kupper added that investors should consider their personal circumstances when deciding how to respond. It all depends on your personal circumstances. For some people these corrections are a fantastic buying opportunity. Looking much better now for the markets. You have to laugh ... This from the Onion. And by the way, you have to remember that falling stocks appear in green in China, not red as commonly used in western markets. I\u2019m hoping someone can give a full explanation of why this is. The Japanese are talking tough on the ugly (for them anyway) side-effect of the China situation, namely that the yen has gone back to seven-month highs as investors seek a safe haven. We\u2019ve now got some more intelligible quotes from the Japanese finance minister, Taro Aso, who warned market players against pushing up the yen too much further as the currency experienced \u201crough\u201d. He said that while there was no immediate plan for G20 and G7 nations to take coordinated action against the market turmoil, global financial authorities were in frequent contact with each other on market developments. Of the yen spike, he said: I would say they are rough, rather than rapid. For the economy to grow stably, it\u2019s better for [currency and stock price] moves to be gradual and steady, rather than rough. It\u2019s going to be difficult to see where markets are going to end up today. On the up side we have: Hang Seng now 1.13% after 0.6% fall at the open. ASX200 up 1.27% at 5,064. Kospi up 0.36% But on the down side: Nikkei is still struggling \u2013 down 2.36% Shanghai Composite down 6.19% The Shanghai Composite index lost 6.4% to 3,004.13 points at the opening a few minutes ago after yesterday\u2019s near-9% plunge sparked another global rout. The CSI300 index was also down 6.3% at 3,070.01 points. This is despite an injection of liquidity, Reuters reports. The central bank made a large 150bn yuan ($23.43bn) injection into the interbank market on Tuesday morning during open market operations. However, similarly large injections last week had little impact on stock market sentiment as the funds remain in the market for only seven days. In fact, many investors worry the injections are being used as a substitute for the longer-term easing to bank reserve requirement ratios which would free up far more substantial sums of cash for long-term investment. Back to stocks and some good news. Australian shares have continued to bounce back. ASX200 is up nearly 1% at 5,050 points Nikkei down 1.34% Hang Seng expected to open down 0.6% We haven\u2019t looked at commodities yet this morning, so here goes. It\u2019s looking slightly better with US crude up slightly at US$38.38 a barrel, although the US benchmark and Brent are still sitting on six-year lows. Gold meanwhile steadied below a seven-week high early on Tuesday. But it\u2019s by no means certain. If this is just a correction \u2013 as Joe Hockey said this morning \u2013 then there\u2019s nothing to worry about and the Fed should go right on ahead, shouldn\u2019t it? Toru Yamamoto, chief bond strategist at Daiwa Securities, said today: There seems to be no consensus with the Fed on whether they are worried about acting too prematurely or too late. However, Chris Weston at IG in Sydney is sure there won\u2019t be a hike now but still thinks that someone has to do something: The ferocity behind the selling is there for everyone to see and there is an all-out liquidation of equity holding. Clearly, the Federal Reserve are not going to hike rates in September and the market is now placing a 20% probability on this fate. Still, we are going to need to see something more inspiring than the Fed holding-off on hiking rates. The mere fact they are having to hold off is bearish in itself, but we need to see something coordinated and specifically coming from Asia given this is where the concern is stemming from. China failed to cut reserve ratio requirements (RRR) over the weekend and this has hurt sentiment and cutting this ratio is a measure designed to fight fires; this alone is not going to significantly reverse sentiment. Still, we will need to hear of easing measures fairly soon and we need to hear of commercial banks increasing liquidity to infrastructure projects. In general, the focus has to shift to something sizeable on the fiscal side. China needs to convince the domestic market and the world that its economy is able to cope with further outflows and that its slowdown is under control. It looks like a lot of volatility until the China market opens. Until then, perhaps we should have a quick look at the bigger picture, namely whether or not this market correction (let\u2019s stick with that before we call it a crisis, or even a crash) means that the US Federal Reserve will still raise rates, as has been widely expected for months. A former US treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers, is in no doubt, saying raising rates soon would be a \u201cserious error\u201d. He said in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal: A reasonable assessment of current conditions suggests that raising rates in the near future would be a serious error that would threaten all three of the Fed\u2019s major objectives: price stability, full employment and financial stability. The ASX200 has gone into positive territory for the day helped by investors buying up bank stocks. They have taken a fearsome beating in recent days \u2013 the financial sector was down 4.6% on Monday alone \u2013 so bargain hunters obviously think they\u2019re now going cheap. Investor champion Stephen Mayne clearly thinks so. Now it\u2019s the turn of Japan\u2019s economics minister Akira Amari. As we reported just a little earlier, investors are buying the yen as a safe-haven asset, bossting it to a seven-month high against the US dollar, which is not really what PM Shinzo Abe wants to happen. However, Amari is putting some heroic spin on it. He says the buying shows Japan\u2019s economic fundamentals are strong, Reuters reports. A bubble had formed in China\u2019s stock market and that stock prices are now adjusting lower, he said. And he added that it was up to the Bank of Japan to decide whether or not to ease monetary policy again \u2013 ie more QE to force the yen back down. The fightback is definitely on this morning. The ASX200 is now up 0.4%. The Nikkei is still getting hammered though. Down 3.57% now. China\u2019s response/lack thereof now looks increasingly critical. The Japanese finance minister Taro Aso has urged China to do something to stop the bleeding. forexlive reports that Aso said: Hope Chinese authorities take appropriate action to stabilise economy, which has big impact on global growth. Recent yen moves are rough, rather than rapid. He also said there are no plans for international coordinated action though. Hopefully we\u2019ll get a proper version of his quotes soon where he doesn\u2019t sound like a robot. But check this out. The Kospi index in Seoul is UP UP UP. Amazing stuff \u2013 it\u2019s risen 0.12%. The fightback starts here. The Nikkei in Japan is down around 2%. Or is the ASX rallying? Much will clearly depend on what happens when the Chinese market opens later on this morning \u2013 in fact, in a little more than an hour\u2019s time. No sign yet of any policy moves by the People\u2019s Bank of China. More on Australia, where the exposure to China is acute. ASX200 is tanking again in Australia. Now down 1.5% with all sectors taking a beating, says CommSec. Kospi down a little in Seoul. Not too bad in Australia \u2013 ASX200 down 0.6%. But Nikkei down 2.5% in Tokyo. Tom Phillips is on deck in Beijing and he sends us this from the Global Times, a Beijing-run tabloid, which blames western doomsayers for some of the problems. There seems to be only one reason for the tumble \u2013 investors lack confidence in China\u2019s economic outlook. The newly released economic figures do not look good. It seems that the words \u201cmisfortunes never come alone\u201d have come true. But the stridently nationalist paper, which is controlled by the Communist party\u2019s mouthpiece paper, The People\u2019s Daily, warned against paying too much attention to western doomsayers. There is no need to worry because of pessimistic voices from the outside world. China\u2019s economy is in a bitter period of structural adjustments. We should become inured to face all sorts of problems with grace. This temporary lack of confidence will not snowball to become destructive. The flip side of that is that other currencies seen as safe havens are doing much better. The yen, for example. That\u2019s bad news for Japanese policymakers who want the yen to fall in value so its exports are cheaper. Here\u2019s Reuters: A senior Japanese government official said on Tuesday that recent exchange-rate moves \u201cappear to be rapid\u201d after the yen surged to a seven-month high against the dollar as investors fled risk amid a global stock market rout. Asked whether a meeting on market moves was planned on Tuesday among the ministry of finance, Bank of Japan and the financial services agency, the official told reporters: \u201cThere is no plan to hold one today.\u201d But he added that the authorities may hold such a meeting in future as needed. I guess Hockey\u2019s glass half-full view will be stress-tested a fair bit in the next few days. Very exciting stuff. In the meantime, the Australian dollar \u2013 along with many other currencies exposed to the Chinese economy \u2013 is having a tough time. The Aussie is down more 0.58% at US71.76c this morning after coming under pressure overnight. More from Australian treasurer Joe Hockey, who says this is a correction, not a crisis. Daniel Hurst has the full story here, but here\u2019s another snippett: He said countries did not have the same \u201cfirepower\u201d \u2013 or the capacity to cut interest rates and engage in stimulatory spending \u2013 as they did at the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008, but added: \u201cIn fact there is no crisis now. It is a correction.\u201d Hockey said despite the falls, the Chinese stockmarket was still 40% higher than it was 12 months ago \u201cand there has been a lot of flighty money in the Chinese stock market, so that\u2019s part of the equation\u201d. How the Pink Un has called it today. if you\u2019re just joining the blog and you want a ctach up on the events of the past 24 hours, here it is courtesy of my colleague Graeme Wearden The US stock market has suffered its biggest sell-off in four years. The Dow Jones ended the day down 588 points, having shed more than 1,000 points in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are both in correction territory tonight, down 10% on their recent peaks. In London, almost \u00a374bn was wiped off the value of the FTSE 100 index, in a rout led by mining giants. European stock markets suffered their worst days trading since 2011. The selloff began in Asia 19 hours ago, where Australia\u2019s market suffered its biggest fall since 2009 and Japan\u2019s Nikkei slumped over 4%. But China was the worst hit, with the Shanghai composite index dropping 8,5% in the biggest selloff since 2007. To summarise the summary, it was a bad day for the markets. In Australia, the federal treasurer Joe Hockey has moved to reassure people that all\u2019s well and that the country can withstand the market volatility. He also hinted that China will wheel out the big guns to try to stop the rot. Question is, what will they do \u2013 if anything? Anyway, my colleague Daniel Hurst will be filing soon on what Hockey has said this morning. But here\u2019s a snippett: I\u2019m absolutely confident, absolutely confident that the fundamentals of the Australian economy and the global economy are still good. Last week, I met with one of the most senior economic figures in China. He reassured us, from his lips to our ears, that China would use whatever tools it has available to make sure that it grows relatively strongly this year ... There is no doubt. The first key event of the day will be the opening across Asia and investors are expecting more steep falls. Futures are pointing to a 3.6% fall in the Australian market, taking the ASX200 well below 5,000 points. Chris Weston from IG Markets said this morning: The world\u2019s capital markets are in meltdown, and investors are asking what can stop the panic. There is no getting away from the fact that this is going to be such a key session. Our opening call is currently 4,820, which implies a 3.6% fall. Good morning and welcome to the live blog on what promises to be another exciting day on the financial markets. After wild swings on Wall Street and Europe, it will be Asia\u2019s turn again this morning, starting with Australia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia at 10am Sydney time (midnight GMT). I\u2019ll go through the main points in a minute but firstly a quick look at the scores on the doors, courtesy of Associated Press.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "US stock markets continued to seesaw on Tuesday following a day of global sell-offs sparked by fears that China\u2019s economic boom is slowing. The Dow Jones industrial average initially appeared to be bouncing back from \u201cBlack Monday\u201d \u2013 a day when it crashed more than 1,000 points before ending the day down 586 points. By noon the Dow was up over 300 points as European markets closed up and investors reacted positively to China\u2019s decision to cut interest rates. But the Dow closed 205 points down, or 1.29%. The S&amp;P 500 ended the day down 25 points, 1.34%, and the Nasdaq closed 0.39% down. The second day of drama came after investors continued to sell in China. The benchmark Shanghai composite index closed 7.6% lower on Tuesday following an 8.5% drop on Monday. Over three days the index has fallen 22%. European markets reversed Monday\u2019s losses but will be closely watched on Wednesday for reaction to the US news. In the UK, the FTSE 100 ended a 10-day losing streak to end up 3%, Germany\u2019s Dax was up 5% and in France the CAC rose 4%. US stock prices were initially buoyed by some positive economic news. The Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index, which had declined in July, rebounded in August. The index now stands at 101.5, up from 91.0. The Commerce Department said new house sales rose 5.4% in July, slightly less than expected but still indicative of recovery in the housing market. Home resales jumped to a near eight-and-a-half-year high in July. Ken Goldstein, economist at the Conference Board, said he expected more volatility to come in the financial markets despite Tuesday\u2019s rally. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing particularly new here,\u201d he said. \u201cChina\u2019s economy is slowing, we knew that. \u201cSomebody woke up last Thursday and headed for the exit and a stampede was on. Now they are back again,\u201d said Goldstein. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say much about our financial geniuses.\u201d Goldstein said consumers could be affected by the stock market wobble, which could trigger a lack of confidence ahead of the all-important holiday season despite relatively good economic data on housing, jobs and manufacturing. \u201cThe more we scare the bejeezus out of the consumer, the more risk we face,\u201d he said. The morning rise comes after three days of falls on stock markets around the world that erased close to $3tn globally. China\u2019s central bank cut interest rates and eased borrowing requirements for banks amid the continuing fall. It was the fifth rate cut since November. Earlier this month China devalued its currency in a move aimed at reviving its slowing economy. A slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy has rattled investors worldwide. The White House sought to reassure investors on Monday as the selloff continued. \u201cThere is no doubt the global economy is more interconnected that than it ever has been,\u201d Josh Earnest, Barack Obama\u2019s chief spokesman, said. \u201cWhat I would encourage people to evaluate is the ongoing strength and resilience of the US economy.\u201d The People\u2019s Bank of China said: \u201cCurrently, there are persisting downward pressures on the country\u2019s economic growth. There has also been quite large volatility in global capital markets recently, and monetary policy tools need to be applied more flexibly.\u201d Gus Faucher, senior macroeconomist at PNC Financial, agreed volatility was likely to continue but the recent falls had been \u201coverdone\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a six-year bull market and I\u2019m not surprised to see a correction, but the domestic fundamentals look pretty solid,\u201d he said. The fall in stock markets comes as the Federal Reserve weighs its first hike in US interest rates since the recession. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist of Capital Economics, said it was too early to speculate on whether the market turmoil would delay any rise. \u201cThere are no signs of any major downturn in the US economy, economic growth in China still appears to be slowing rather than collapsing and emerging markets are not about to endure a repeat of the 1997-98 Asian crisis. The current bout of market turmoil, if it continues, might persuade the Fed to hold off on raising interest rates in September. Since that volatility doesn\u2019t reflect any genuine economic slump, however, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it proved short-lived leaving the way open for the Fed to begin raising rates at some point this year,\u201d he wrote in a note to investors. \u201cEven a September rate hike is still a significant possibility if the turmoil abates over the remainder of this week.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hedge funds are set to bank tens of millions of pounds from the slump in share prices in London, having bet almost \u00a318bn that the FTSE 100 would fall. The funds making the bets include Lansdowne Partners, which is run by George Osborne\u2019s best man, Peter Davies, and Odey Asset Management, which is led by Crispin Odey \u2013 who made millions by predicting the credit crisis and earlier this year said the world was heading for a downturn \u201clikely to be remembered in 100 years\u201d. Short selling, effectively betting that share prices will fall, involves borrowing shares in a company and selling them with a view to buying them back at a lower price. The hedge fund makes a profit by banking the difference , as long as the shares do in fact fall. As concerns over the slowing Chinese economy have grown, traders have increasingly bet that the fallout would be felt in blue-chip shares in London. The average percentage of FTSE 100 company shares out on loan to short sellers has risen from 1.2% a year ago to 1.75%. The value of the short positions hedge funds have taken in FTSE 100 companies is \u00a317.8bn, according to research by Markit. By the close of trading on Monday the FTSE 100 had fallen for 10 days in a row, sending it 17% down from its record high in April, before bouncing back by 3% on Tuesday. The biggest short positions are in Wm Morrison and J Sainsbury, with 16.4% of Morrisons shares out on loan, and 16.2% of Sainsbury\u2019s shares. Traders have bet on the two supermarkets struggling further in the face of fierce competition from the discounters Aldi and Lidl. There has also been an increase in the short selling of companies likely to be hit by the falling oil price and slowing economic growth in China. The engineering group Weir has 7.5% of its shares on loan, the fund manager Aberdeen Asset Management 6.1% and Royal Dutch Shell around 4.4% as concerns continue that its deal to buy its rival BG Group could fall apart. Hedge funds have to disclose short positions to the Financial Conduct Authority, after the rules were changed following the onset of the 2008 financial crisis. The FCA\u2019s databases shows that the biggest single bets hedge funds placed include Odey taking a 1.6% position against Aberdeen and Lansdowne shorting 2.6% of Morrisons. Short selling could drag stocks down further as hedge funds increase their positions, according to Jake Robbins, a fund manager at Premier Asset Management. Algorithmic trading systems, which kick in as they notice other investors selling, have added to pressure on the market. Robbins said: \u201cFurther losses are likely as the Chinese economy slows, retail investors who have borrowed to invest are forced to liquidate, economic fundamentals deteriorate further, and valuations remain high relative to last year when the government-induced rally began. \u201cGovernment intervention may stabilise things briefly, but the Chinese government is discovering that free markets are exactly that and very difficult to control. \u201cWith a backdrop of poor economic data for China and other concerns about the real value in many Chinese companies, we are maintaining our cautious view concerning investing in this market.\u201d The short positions taken by Odey echo his bets before the 2008 financial crisis, when he shorted Bradford &amp; Bingley, the bank that later had to be rescued by taxpayers. In a note to clients earlier this year, he said there could be a severe downturn as a result of the falling oil price, the slowdown in China and the fact that central banks were running out of options after using their firepower to fight the 2008 crisis. \u201cThis downcycle is likely to be remembered in 100 years,\u201d he said. \u201cSadly this down cycle will cause a great deal of damage, precisely because it will happen despite the efforts of central banks to thwart it. \u201cWe are in the first stage of this downturn. It is too early to see what will happen. A change of this magnitude means the darkness and mist is very great.\u201d The Markit data also shows that the average short position in FTSE 250 companies has risen 24% in the last year to 1.6%. The most shorted companies in the FTSE 250, which is more domestically-focused than the FTSE 100, are the construction group Carillion,the investment manager Ashmore, and the property investor Hansteen.",

      "bodyText": "Asia\u2019s richest person was the largest loser in Monday\u2019s stock market crash in China, after stocks in the region fell dramatically. Chinese tycoon Wang Jianlin, whose UK interests include luxury boat firm Sunseeker yachts and commercial property in London, lost $3.6bn (\u00a32.3bn) on Monday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Wang\u2019s main business vehicle intends to build a five-star hotel on the Nine Elms regeneration site in south-west London, billed as the first Chinese luxury hotel overseas. Chinese businesses have been big investors in Britain in recent years, courted by the prime minister David Cameron and London mayor Boris Johnson on well-publicised trade visits. Chinese investors have also taken stakes in Thames Water, Heathrow and Weetabix. Wang saw $2bn wiped from his stake in Dalian Wanda commercial properties and lost nearly $1bn from his Wanda Cinema Line, the world\u2019s largest cinema operator.There were further losses from stakes in private companies. Even after Monday\u2019s decline, Wang\u2019s fortune stood at $31.2bn, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Earlier this year, Wang took a 20% stake in the Spanish La Liga football club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. According to Bloomberg, 24 billionaires saw their wealth fall by more than $1bn on Monday, with many of them based in Asia. However, those based elsewhere were not immune to big falls. Bloomberg said the wealth of Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder, fell $3.2bn on Monday, the biggest decline after Wang. The losses suffered by Wang are likely to have increased on Tuesday following further falls in the Chinese stock market. Elsewhere, Hong Kong resident Li Ka-shing, whose interests span from shipping to the Three mobile network in the UK, lost $1.5bn in Monday\u2019s selloff. The third richest man in Asia, Jack Ma, founder of ecommerce group Alibaba, lost $546m according to Bloomberg, but retains a net worth of $29.6bn.",

    "webTitle": "John Lewis boss: we will overtake Ikea as Britain's biggest homeware retailer", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Move over Billy and never mind the meatballs, the boss of John Lewis has warned Ikea that the department store is aiming to take its place as Britain\u2019s biggest home and furniture retailer. Ikea arrived in the UK in 1987 and its warehouse stores have become firmly established as the country\u2019s favourite destination for flatpack furniture, chairs and lighting. However, John Lewis is potentially on course to knock the Swedish company off the top spot after investing millions in a revamp of its home business. In a clear statement of intent, John Lewis will unveil a refurbishment of its flagship Oxford Street store next week. Speaking in the store, Andy Street, John Lewis\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cIf you look at the trading results for the last five years, ever since the recession really, we have gained market share significantly. \u201cNow we are clearly second in the market behind Ikea \u2013 and clearly first in lots of categories \u2013 but we will overtake Ikea. I am not sure exactly when, but I am more than happy to predict it will be within the next four years, at the pace we are closing the gap at the moment.\u201d Ikea will account for 6% of homeware, furniture and flooring sales this year, while John Lewis will have 5.8% of the market, according to the retail consultancy Conlumino. But if Street succeeds in his ambition, it would be a symbolic moment for John Lewis, and would underline the way the retailer has outperformed its traditional department store rivals, House of Fraser and Marks &amp; Spencer, since the financial crisis in 2008. Street claimed the modernisation of the home department in the Oxford Street store, which has cost \u00a314m, will throw down the gauntlet to John Lewis\u2019s rivals and make it the \u201cbest in the world\u201d. The revamp includes a new home hub at the centre of the department, covering two floors, that will enable shoppers to digitally place furniture within virtual rooms of their home and design their own carpets and curtains. John Lewis has agreed a deal with West Elm for the popular American home brand to open a shop within the refurbished department. West Elm has one shop on Tottenham Court Road in central London but now plans to open further outlets within John Lewis stores. Street said the overhaul of the home department in John Lewis\u2019s biggest store reinforced the importance of the business to the retailer. About 80% of homewares John Lewis sells are its own brand, far ahead of other departments, and it owns a textile factory in Blackburn. Street said: \u201cWe have always said we have a nice balance between home, fashion and technology, but if we are really honest the area that John Lewis is most famous for is home. I always say home is where the heart is for this business. \u201cWe felt, given how technology was changing and how people wanted to look for their individual taste, that we needed to look again and set a new bar for how we are trading.\u201d But he denied that John Lewis was simply trying to beat Ikea by upgrading its home department. John Lewis has 31 department stores and 11 John Lewis at home stores in the UK, while Ikea has 18 stores, with another planned in Reading. Street said: \u201cIt is much broader than that. It has got to be better than anything anybody is doing. For lighting, to be very honest, B&amp;Q is the best. So we have got to be better than it there, we have got to be better than Ikea in furniture and we have got to be better than Dunelm in furnishing and fabrics. \u201cWe do not believe that anybody has this combination of products and services together. This is how John Lewis must be in home. We believe this is the best in the world.\u201d Street said the home and furnishing market is bouncing back after a slowdown in the runup the election. He said furniture sales had risen by more than 6%. Describing the British consumer as resilient, he said: \u201cThere was a real wobble around April and May in home and big-ticket trade, because I think people were just waiting to see. But the encouraging thing is that if you look at our orders in the last couple of months, they are really coming back strongly.\u201d After completing the Oxford Street refurbishment, he will turn his attention to the opening of a new John Lewis store in Birmingham and then to Black Friday in the last week of November, which is expected to be the biggest online shopping day so far in Britain. Street has previously said retailers could reconsider their approach to offering heavy discounts on Black Friday, an American tradition. Last year, the beginning of the Christmas shopping period was marred by in-store scuffles on Black Friday itself, followed by delays to deliveries and a sharp slowdown in sales in the two weeks after the discount day. But this year, he said John Lewis is preparing for sales on Black Friday to be 20% higher. Street said: \u201cWe are planning for about a 20% uplift \u2026 so the server capacity we need for online, the staffing rotas for our shops, the deals with all of our suppliers \u2013 it is all being done and I expect us to have, as last year, a clear run in the runup to Christmas. That is hard in this logistics world now. \u201cThe biggest priority as ever at this time is managing the logistics [for] Christmas. We said it last year, we had a very good Christmas because we coped with that and won confidence from customers. I am dead sure that we are all going to be tested on that again this year and we have got to be in the winners\u2019 enclosure again.\u201d Last month, John Lewis announced that it would introduce a \u00a32 charge for customers to collect online orders under \u00a330 in store, with Street claiming that the business model for online retailing had become \u201cbonkers\u201d. Despite the threat of a backlash on social media, he said shoppers had adapted brilliantly to the change. He added: \u201cIf you had asked what has surprised me in the last few weeks, it would have been that this has been accepted very willingly. I think I may have had one customer correspondence about it. It is almost silent on social media. I am not saying everyone likes it, but I think the argument that says this is a necessity has actually got through. \u201cSome have taken the charge, some are actually probably not ordering and some are clearly consolidating their orders to be above the \u00a330 threshold. I know that in the long term what we are doing will prove to be the right answer for the market.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Move over Billy and never mind the meatballs, the boss of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis\">John Lewis</a> has warned Ikea that the department store is aiming to take its place as Britain\u2019s biggest home and furniture retailer.</p> <p><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ikea\">Ikea</a> arrived in the UK in 1987 and its warehouse stores have become firmly established as the country\u2019s favourite destination for flatpack furniture, chairs and lighting.</p> <p>However, John Lewis is potentially on course to knock the Swedish company off the top spot after investing millions in a revamp of its home business. In a clear statement of intent, John Lewis will unveil a refurbishment of its flagship Oxford Street store next week.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Speaking in the store, Andy Street, John Lewis\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cIf you look at the trading results for the last five years, ever since the recession really, we have gained market share significantly. </p> <p>\u201cNow we are clearly second in the market behind Ikea \u2013 and clearly first in lots of categories \u2013 but we will overtake Ikea. I am not sure exactly when, but I am more than happy to predict it will be within the next four years, at the pace we are closing the gap at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Ikea will account for 6% of homeware, furniture and flooring sales this year, while John Lewis will have 5.8% of the market, according to the retail consultancy Conlumino.</p> <p>But if Street succeeds in his ambition, it would be a symbolic moment for John Lewis, and would underline the way the retailer has outperformed its traditional department store rivals, House of Fraser and Marks &amp; Spencer, since the financial crisis in 2008. </p> <p>Street claimed the modernisation of the home department in the Oxford Street store, which has cost \u00a314m, will throw down the gauntlet to John Lewis\u2019s rivals and make it the \u201cbest in the world\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The revamp includes a new home hub at the centre of the department, covering two floors, that will enable shoppers to digitally place furniture within virtual rooms of their home and design their own carpets and curtains.</p> <p>John Lewis has agreed a deal with West Elm for the popular American home brand to open a shop within the refurbished department. West Elm has one shop on Tottenham Court Road in central London but now plans to open further outlets within John Lewis stores.</p> <p>Street said the overhaul of the home department in John Lewis\u2019s biggest store reinforced the importance of the business to the retailer. </p> <p>About 80% of homewares John Lewis sells are its own brand, far ahead of other departments, and it owns a textile factory in Blackburn.</p> <p>Street said: \u201cWe have always said we have a nice balance between home, fashion and technology, but if we are really honest the area that John Lewis is most famous for is home. I always say home is where the heart is for this business.</p> <p>\u201cWe felt, given how technology was changing and how people wanted to look for their individual taste, that we needed to look again and set a new bar for how we are trading.\u201d</p> <p>But he denied that John Lewis was simply trying to beat Ikea by upgrading its home department. John Lewis has 31 department stores and 11 John Lewis at home stores in the UK, while Ikea has 18 stores, with another planned in Reading.</p> <p>Street said: \u201cIt is much broader than that. It has got to be better than anything anybody is doing. For lighting, to be very honest, B&amp;Q is the best. So we have got to be better than it there, we have got to be better than Ikea in furniture and we have got to be better than Dunelm in furnishing and fabrics.</p> <p>\u201cWe do not believe that anybody has this combination of products and services together. This is how John Lewis must be in home. We believe this is the best in the world.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/31/john-lewis-customer-services-digital-age\">Has John Lewis lost the digital-age plot?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Street said the home and furnishing market is bouncing back after a slowdown in the runup the election. He said furniture sales had risen by more than 6%.<br></p> <p>Describing the British consumer as resilient, he said: \u201cThere was a real wobble around April and May in home and big-ticket trade, because I think people were just waiting to see. But the encouraging thing is that if you look at our orders in the last couple of months, they are really coming back strongly.\u201d</p> <p>After completing the Oxford Street refurbishment, he will turn his attention to the opening of a new John Lewis store in Birmingham and then to Black Friday in the last week of November, which is expected to be the biggest online shopping day so far in Britain.</p> <p>Street has previously said retailers could <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/05/john-lewis-boss-says-rein-in-black-friday\">reconsider their approach</a> to offering heavy discounts on Black Friday, an American tradition. Last year, the beginning of the Christmas shopping period was marred by in-store scuffles on Black Friday itself, followed by delays to deliveries and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/02/john-lewis-christmas-week-sales-black-friday\">sharp slowdown in sales</a> in the two weeks after the discount day.</p> <p>But this year, he said John Lewis is preparing for sales on Black Friday to be 20% higher. </p> <p>Street said: \u201cWe are planning for about a 20% uplift \u2026 so the server capacity we need for online, the staffing rotas for our shops, the deals with all of our suppliers \u2013 it is all being done and I expect us to have, as last year, a clear run in the runup to Christmas.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Hester, the chief executive of RSA Insurance, could leave the company with more than \u00a38.5m after he and his fellow board members said they were likely to accept a provisional \u00a35.6bn takeover offer from bigger rival Zurich. Hester has 1.36m performance-related shares in RSA worth \u00a37.5m that are likely to pay out if a deal is done. If he leaves the merged business he would be paid his \u00a3950,000 salary and in addition could be paid a bonus for his work in the current financial year, after receiving a \u00a3939,000 bonus for 2014. Zurich proposed paying 550p a share in cash for RSA, whose board said it would probably recommend an offer at that price to its shareholders once Zurich had inspected its books and details of the deal were agreed. The proposed agreement caps a month of manoeuvring by the two companies after a leak forced Zurich to admit in July it was considering a bid. Hester was initially dismissive of Zurich\u2019s interest, saying RSA, owner of the More Than brand, had a strong future and warning the Swiss company not to try to buy it cheaply. But the companies\u2019 advisers held talks which became more serious last week as a deadline approached for Zurich to make a firm offer. Under City rules, Zurich was given until 5pm on Tuesday to lodge a bid or walk away for at least six months. With the two sides close to agreement, RSA has asked the Takeover Panel for an extension until 22 September. Hester was drafted in early last year to clear up the mess at RSA after an accounting scandal in Ireland revealed wider financial problems at the business. His pay has been the subject of controversy and some large shareholders were unhappy that RSA awarded him three times his annual salary in performance-linked shares this year. Before joining RSA, Hester ran Royal Bank of Scotland for five years after the bank was bailed out by the government. He was forced to waive a \u00a31m bonus in 2012 after RBS had a computer meltdown. He became known for turning round financial companies after cleaning up Abbey National, whose sale to Santander in 2004 also reaped him a big payday. Zurich\u2019s proposed bid is about 26% more than RSA\u2019s share price before the Swiss firm revealed its interest, and 11% more than its 495p closing price on Monday. RSA shareholders would also receive the 3.5p-a-share interim dividend announced at the UK insurer\u2019s results on 6 August. RSA said: \u201cThe board has indicated to Zurich that it would be willing to recommend an offer at the level of the possible offer to RSA shareholders subject to the satisfactory resolution of the other terms of the offer.\u201d Announcing better than expected results for RSA earlier this month, Hester said the company was becoming more valuable and he was thought to be looking for closer to 600p a share from Zurich. But RSA\u2019s board is said to accept that Zurich\u2019s proposed price takes account of the potential from RSA\u2019s improving performance while giving shareholders a cash payment in turbulent markets. Large investors, including Cevian Capital, the activist shareholder with a 13% stake, would have been consulted by RSA and some investors are said to have urged the UK insurer to get the deal done. Analysts at Berenberg said the price was a good one for RSA and Zurich could struggle to achieve its desired 10% rate of return on the deal. That could be bad news for RSA\u2019s 19,000 employees as Zurich cuts out overlaps with its own UK operations. RSA started business in 1710 as the Sun Fire Office, which insured the house of Captain James Cook before he set out on his voyages in 1865. It also covered Down House, Charles Darwin\u2019s home when he wrote On the Origin of the Species. The company\u2019s fortunes have oscillated in recent years. Royal &amp; Sun Alliance, as it was then, nearly collapsed in 2003. After its fortunes revived, it then hit problems again in 2013 as it issued a string of profit warnings and admitted it was short of capital.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cMonday was absolutely manic,\u201d said Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at spread-betting and stockbroking firm IG Group. Beauchamp was speaking on Tuesday as a sense of calm appeared to be returning to IG\u2019s offices in the City following one of the most turbulent days since the crash of 2008. Monday\u2019s state of nervousness had been replaced, in London at least, by the sight of many stocks trading positively, led by the mining groups. The question on everybody\u2019s lips, though, is whether the correction will last, or whether China\u2019s slowing economy will have a lasting negative effect on the world\u2019s financial markets and economies. As the US markets readied for the open, most employees at IG\u2019s offices were confident of a positive few hours ahead at least. The firm\u2019s market analysts pointed to China\u2019s decision mid-morning to cut interest rates as having boosted confidence that Tuesday would be a better day and not just for Wall Street investors. \u201cIt\u2019s the calm after the storm,\u201d one IG analyst said, with many in the office discussing whether what has been dubbed as \u201cBlack Monday\u201d would end up being a one-off correction to the financial markets or the beginning of something more serious. \u201cIt\u2019s always tempting to think these things might be a one-off day of selling but one\u2019s reluctant to call it like that after the 2008 crash which just went on and on,\u201d he added. \u201cYou got the sense yesterday that there\u2019s so much money waiting on the sidelines and that the US is struggling to move higher, \u201csaid Beauchamp. As the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened more than 2% higher in New York on Tuesday, as predicted by the futures markets, the calmness at IG\u2019s offices appeared justified. Only the presence of TV cameras on the IG trading floor, and the stock market-related news flashes showing on a collection of monitors around the room gave any indication that the financial markets were going through a tumultuous period. But it felt a bit like the television crews had arrived a few hours too late. Beauchamp said the next key time for market-watchers would be overnight when it would become clear whether Chinese investors might be prepared to buy into the market again. \u201cAssuming US markets hold, the next key development will be assessing whether the rate cut in China has revived a buying appetite in the hope of further measures to come,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The global stock market panic appeared to be easing on Tuesday as US markets opened up following a dramatic sell-off by investors around the world dubbed\u201cBlack Monday\u201d. On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average crashed more than 1,000 points when it opened, ending the day down 586 points, or 3.6%. In the first two minutes after the opening bell on Tuesday, the Dow rose 300 points and was up 372 points, or 2.35%, before noon. The S&amp;P 500 was up 2.43% and the Nasdaq 3.29%, also reversing much of their Monday declines. US markets rose as Europe reversed Monday\u2019s losses. In the UK, the FTSE 100 ended a 10-day losing streak to end up 3%, Germany\u2019s Dax was up 5% and in France the CAC rose 4%. The recovery in US stock prices was buoyed by some positive economic news. The Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index, which had declined in July, rebounded in August. The index now stands at 101.5, up from 91.0. The Commerce Department said new house sales rose 5.4% in July, slightly less than expected but still indicative of recovery in the housing market. Home resales jumped to a near eight-and-a-half-year high in July. Ken Goldstein, economist at the Conference Board, said he expected more volatility to come in the financial markets despite Tuesday\u2019s rally. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing particularly new here,\u201d he said. \u201cChina\u2019s economy is slowing, we knew that. \u201cSomebody woke up last Thursday and headed for the exit and a stampede was on. Now they are back again,\u201d said Goldstein. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say much about our financial geniuses.\u201d Goldstein said consumers could be affected by the stock market wobble, which could trigger a lack of confidence ahead of the all-important holiday season despite relatively good economic data on housing, jobs and manufacturing. \u201cThe more we scare the bejeezus out of the consumer, the more risk we face,\u201d he said. The morning rise comes after three days of falls on stock markets around the world that erased close to $3tn globally. The global panic seems to have been largely triggered by woes in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Investors continued to sell in Chinawith the benchmark Shanghai composite index closing 7.6% lower on Tuesday after falling 8.5% on Monday. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 4%. China\u2019s central bank cut interest rates and eased borrowing requirements for banks amid the continuing fall. It was the fifth rate cut since November. The White House sought to reassure investors on Monday as the selloff continued. \u201cThere is no doubt the global economy is more interconnected than it ever has been,\u201d Josh Earnest, Barack Obama\u2019s chief spokesman, said. \u201cWhat I would encourage people to evaluate is the ongoing strength and resilience of the US economy.\u201d The People\u2019s Bank of China said: \u201cCurrently, there are persisting downward pressures on the country\u2019s economic growth. There has also been quite large volatility in global capital markets recently, and monetary policy tools need to be applied more flexibly.\u201d Gus Faucher, senior macroeconomist at PNC Financial, agreed volatility was likely to continue but the recent falls had been \u201coverdone\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a six-year bull market and I\u2019m not surprised to see a correction, but the domestic fundamentals look pretty solid,\u201d he said. The fall in stock markets comes as the Federal Reserve weighs its first hike in US interest rates since the recession. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist of Capital Economics, said it was too early yet to speculate whether the market turmoil would delay any rise. \u201cThere are no signs of any major downturn in the US economy, economic growth in China still appears to be slowing rather than collapsing and emerging markets are not about to endure a repeat of the 1997-98 Asian crisis. The current bout of market turmoil, if it continues, might persuade the Fed to hold off on raising interest rates in September. Since that volatility doesn\u2019t reflect any genuine economic slump, however, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it proved short-lived leaving the way open for the Fed to begin raising rates at some point this year,\u201d he wrote in a note to investors. \u201cEven a September rate hike is still a significant possibility if the turmoil abates over the remainder of this week.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "China has tried to reboot its economy for the last year after it became obvious that a slowdown in early 2014 was turning into a steady decline in growth. Governments can pull many levers to influence the behaviour of households, businesses and investors. Here are the six main ones Beijing has used. Cutting interest rates The cut on Tuesday is the fifth since November and brings interest rates in the country down to 4.86% \u2013 an all-time low after having averaged 6.36% between 1996 and last year. The People\u2019s Bank of China shaved another 0.25 percentage points off the borrowing and deposit rates to spur bank lending and encourage savers to spend the cash rather than earn a declining return on their money. Reserve ratio reduced China\u2019s central bank took half a percentage point off the reserve requirement ratio, which governs how much money banks can lend to the economy. The move runs counter to the professed desire of Beijing leaders to restrict a property bubble that only a couple of years ago looked like wrecking the economy. As in the west, China has found that investment funds are increasingly channelled into property. Currency devaluation For many years Beijing came under fire for keeping the yuan low against the dollar to increase China\u2019s exports. But in recent years the yuan has appreciated in value, especially against the dollar, euro and yen. A fortnight ago Beijing shocked investors when it embarked on a forced devaluation. It argued that the move was part of its liberalisation programme \u2013 freeing the currency a little from central control. To prevent panic selling, it then used its financial muscle to buy yuan and stop it falling further. This week the yuan is 4.6% lower against the dollar and, according to many analysts, heading for a 10% cut over the next few months. Buying stock market funds China now has more than 90 million individual investors, a constituency that\u2019s larger than the membership of the Chinese Communist party. Cuts in interest rates and more relaxed lending rules introduced this year encouraged investors to storm the stock market, sending the Shanghai Composite index soaring by 150%. This bubble burst in June, and the spiralling market only came to rest after Beijing spent billions of yuan buying back stock and forcing state-owned industries to maintain cross-shareholdings. Beijing has spent about \u00a3130bn propping up the market, including over the last few days. Liberalising pension fund investment rules China\u2019s state pension funds have held government bonds in their portfolios of investments, but until now, equities were banned. Then came the announcement at the weekend that allowed state funds to put as much as 30% of their assets into domestic stock markets. This is expected to triger a flow of investment cash into the Shanghai index, pushing values back up. Cutting stamp duty Stock market traders are always complaining they pay too much tax on transactions. Governments tend to want shareholders to increase in number and to hold their investment for the long term. In this context, stamp duty provides a tidy tax income and a disincentive to trading for its own sake. On Tuesday the People\u2019s Bank said reforms, including a cut in stamp duty, were aimed at reducing \u201cthe social cost of financing to promote and support the sustainable and healthy developments of the real economy\u201d. Analysts said it was a quick fix to bolster a falling stock market.",

      "bodyText": "Beijing has taken action. After two days of painful stock market falls, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) has seen enough. Interest rates have been cut to put a floor under share prices and support the real economy. The reduction in borrowing costs was modest but significant. The one-year lending rate went down by a quarter point to 4.6%. The reserve requirement ratio (RRR), which determines how much banks can lend to the economy, has been cut by half a percentage point. Beijing had the scope to do more to boost confidence after the turmoil of recent days, but has opted for a more measured approach at this stage. There are reasons for this. Capital has been leaving China at a rapid rate in recent weeks, and a big reduction in interest rates would have provided extra encouragement for investors to take their money elsewhere. The official line up until now has been that the Chinese economy is slowing in line with expectations rather than in the early stages of a full-blown recession. Slashing interest rates would have been seen as evidence that the economy was indeed suffering a hard landing and might have further damaged confidence. China wants to keep some of its powder dry. The statement issued by the PBoC, which talked about the downward pressure on the economy and the need to have more flexible policy tools to cope with the stock market blowout, reflects how concerned policymakers are about recent events. Having decided not to act over the weekend, when many analysts had been braced for interest rates and reserve requirements to be cut, the PBoC timed its move well. Bourses in Europe all bounced despite the overnight drop in shares on the Shanghai stock exchange, and Wall Street is also on course to open higher. Intervention is at its most effective when markets have just turned, because central banks can encourage bargain hunters and hurt investors who have \u201cshorted\u201d the market by selling shares they do not actually hold in the hope of buying them later at a lower cost. One thing the action lacked was the element of surprise. It was inevitable that there would be a response to a share price fall that has wiped out all the gains in the stock market seen this year. Even so, the PBoC will be pleased by the initial market response, with shares in London, Frankfurt and Paris all well on the way to wiping out Monday\u2019s losses.",

As most of the 70 or so pensioners gathered in the hall studiously plot their plummeting fortunes, one woman paces the room, seething. \u201cThis is all because foreign countries are waging a currency war with China\u201d she yells, \u201cand now they\u2019ve dropped a bomb on the Chinese stock market.\u201d Security guards at the brokerage branch are wary of journalists taking photos, and it does not take long to see why. In front of the retirees are nine large LED screens flashing stock prices \u2013 and they are a sea of green. The optics are not good. Red is a lucky colour in China, so green is the colour of choice to show when a share has lost value. \u201cI\u2019ve lived through wars,\u201d one elderly gentleman tells the Guardian, \u201cbut nothing as horrible as this.\u201d The 82-year-old, who declines to give his name, says: \u201cI depend on the Communist party to put food on my table,\u201d . He holds his hands up in a handcuff gesture, suggesting he is not free to talk. \u201cThe Communist party is awful, all my money is gone.\u201d He has been playing the stock market for years, using his own and his son\u2019s money. \u201cWhat I have to say is not the same as the others,\u201d he says, motioning to the other traders. \u201cThings were better under Chairman Mao. People\u2019s morality was better back then and there was no prostitution.\u201d Despite his criticism of the Communist party and its current leaders, he says other world leaders should share the blame. Most of the retirees tracking their plummeting fortunes are not in a reflective mood. \u201cDon\u2019t bother me,\u201d says one woman. \u201cI\u2019m trying to focus.\u201d One trader, in his 60s, seems less focused on the market movements and more on his copy of the state-run Reference News. The newspaper contains summaries of western news reports that place the blame for the global market rout on China\u2019s economic weakness. Mrs Liu, 87, says she mostly visits the trading hall to \u201cgive her brain some exercise\u201d and hang out with friends. \u201cExperts on TV said it would go up to 6,000,\u201d she says, referring to the Shanghai Composite index, which closed below 3,000 yesterday. \u201cWho could have guessed [the share prices] would take such a turn?\u201d Behind her a group of investors turnd their chairs to face each other to chat, play cards, sip tea and eat steamed stuffed buns as trading halts for lunch. \u201cThis is happening all over the world,\u201d she continues. \u201cThe global economy is not performing well. It\u2019s not China\u2019s fault\u201d. Mrs Liu says that, unlike many other traders, she has invested conservatively: \u201cI\u2019ve invested a couple of thousand yuan. But I haven\u2019t been drawing on my savings \u2013 just some from my monthly pension \u2013 not enough to affect my quality of life.\u201d She admits she is not optimistic about where the market is heading but says: \u201cIf my stocks pick up, I\u2019m ready to sell. That way I won\u2019t lose all my money. \u201cThe government did try to rescue the stock market, but this time it hasn\u2019t been effective. I hope the market will pick up, but it\u2019s beyond the power of the common people.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The competition watchdog has provisionally cleared Poundland\u2019s \u00a355m takeover of its rival single-price retailer, 99p Stores, arguing that there are enough value chains vying for customers to allow the deal. The Competition and Markets Authority said its four-month review of the proposed deal had found that competition would not be damaged if Poundland were to buy 99p Stores to create an 800-store chain. Both retailers sell similar ranges of consumer goods, stationery, food and drink, and homeware. The CMA said the two companies, along with Poundworld, were each other\u2019s closest competitors but that the combined business would still experience strong competition from Wilko, B&amp;M and other value retailers, as well as Tesco and Asda among the supermarkets. As a result, customers would not be harmed by less choice or Poundland reducing the value of its offers, the CMA said. The CMA\u2019s announcement is a victory for Poundland, which argued that the rise of value retailing in the UK, the expansion plans of its rivals and supermarkets matching some of its \u00a31 offers meant it would continue to meet strong competition. Poundland\u2019s shares rose 5.7% to 349p in response to the CMA\u2019s statement. Announcing its initial findings in April, the CMA said competition was in doubt in 80 places where their stores overlapped and in another 12 locations where shop openings would cause them to compete soon. That raised the prospect of Poundland having to sell the overlapping stores to satisfy the regulator, which launched a \u201cphase two\u201d review to examine the implications of the deal in detail. Philip Marsden, who chaired the CMA\u2019s inquiry, said: \u201cThere has been a significant rise in prominence of value retailers for UK shoppers. Both across its business and in individual areas, Poundland would continue to face competition from other value retailers so we don\u2019t currently believe customers will face a reduction in choice, value or lower-quality service as a result of the merger. \u201cWe have also seen in recent years the big four supermarkets engaging in intense price competition, some of which involving the promotion of \u00a31 products. On the basis of the evidence to date, we do not think customers will be worse off from the merger.\u201d Once it has final approval from the CMA, the acquisition of 99p Stores, announced in February, would add 250 extra shops to Poundland\u2019s estate of nearly 600 UK outlets, accelerating its progress towards a target of 1,000 stores here. The company, which topped sales of \u00a31bn this year, also has more than 40 Irish stores and nine in Spain under the Dealz brand. Jim McCarthy, chief executive of Poundland, said: \u201cWe welcome the CMA\u2019s provisional clearance of our acquisition of 99p Stores and we look forward to a satisfactory conclusion to its phase two review. We continue to believe that the acquisition of 99p will be great for customers and for shareholders alike.\u201d McCarthy plans to rebrand 99p Stores as Poundland, meaning regular shoppers at the acquired business will have to pay a penny more per item. The CMA consulted Poundland, 99p Stores, other retailers and 5,000 customers for its review and also examined the two companies\u2019 internal documents and data. Anyone wishing to respond to the CMA\u2019s provisional findings has until 16 September to do so.",

      "bodyText": "Markets across Asia experienced more turbulence on Tuesday, with Chinese shares suffering a dramatic fall of more than 6% a day after hundreds of billions of dollars were knocked off global stocks. As the gravity of China\u2019s market woes continued to sink in \u2013 following a trading session dubbed \u201cBlack Monday\u201d by the country\u2019s official news agency \u2013 stock markets in the region were again hit by wild fluctuations. The Shanghai Composite index fell 6.4% in the first few minutes of trading on Tuesday before clawing back ground later in the day. There was better news from other regional markets, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei making some gains after losing 4.6% the previous session \u2013 to some extent easing concerns that the pounding dealt to markets around the world would continue. Australia\u2019s ASX200, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng also showed gains as the trading today went on. The MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan went up 1.7% after an initial dip to a three-year low. Policymakers in Japan called on Chinese authorities to take action to prevent further dramatic slides. The Shanghai Composite\u2019s falls continued despite a US$24bn injection of liquidity by China\u2019s central bank on Tuesday. Japan is concerned about the yen\u2019s rise against the dollar in recent days, as a stronger Japanese currency eats into the profits of Japanese automakers and other exporters. The finance minister, Taro Aso, said he hoped China would take action to stabilise its economy, but added that Tokyo had no immediate plans to introduce its own stimulus package. Aso later warned market players against pushing up the yen \u2013 seen as a \u201csafe haven\u201d currency\u201d \u2013 too much further, saying that its spike against the dollar overnight was problematic for Japan\u2019s economy. He said there were no plans as yet for co-ordinated action among G7 and G20 countries. \u201cI would say [the yen\u2019s rises overnight] are rough, rather than rapid,\u201d Aso said. \u201cFor the economy to grow stably, it\u2019s better for [currency and stock price] moves to be gradual and steady, rather than rough.\u201d The economics minister, Akira Amari, said the flurry of yen buying was proof of Japan\u2019s sound economic fundamentals, adding that it was up to the Bank of Japan to decide whether or not to ease monetary policy with more quantitative easing to force the yen back down. The yen surged nearly 5% to a seven-month high against the dollar on Monday as investors worried about the slowdown in China bought the relatively risk-free Japanese currency. The dollar rebounded to the upper 119 yen zone later on Tuesday in Tokyo. At noon the US currency fetched 119.86-87 yen after plummeting to as low as 116.15 yen in New York overnight. All eyes were on how Chinese markets would respond throughout Tuesday, amid reports that the country\u2019s leadership is running out of ideas to stabilise the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. China is facing a slowdown in economic growth, the banking system is short of cash and investors are pulling money out of the country. Chinese shares led Monday\u2019s market meltdown, plunging more than 8% to post their biggest losses since 2007. \u201cA co-ordinated policy response is critical and much of this needs to come from Asian economies,\u201d said Bernard Aw at IG Markets. \u201cA spate of better economic news may help to allay concerns that global growth is not deteriorating. Certainly improvements in the Chinese economy will be welcomed.\u201d Mark Williams of Capital Economics said investors were \u201coverreacting\u201d to the economic risks in China. \u201cThe surge in prices that started a year ago was speculative, rather than driven by any improvement in fundamentals,\u201d Williams said. \u201cA combination of poor data and policy inaction in China may have triggered today\u2019s market falls but the bigger picture is that we are witnessing the inevitable implosion of an equity market bubble.\u201d Investors, worried that the Chinese economy is growing at a much slower pace than Beijing\u2019s 7% target for 2015, have also been spooked by uncertainty over US monetary policy. The heavy fall in share prices has tempered expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in September, according to some analysts. \u201cThere seems to be no consensus with the Fed on whether they are worried about acting too prematurely or too late,\u201d said Toru Yamamoto, chief bond strategist at Daiwa Securities. On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell more than 1,000 points before mounting a recovery. Still, the day ended with a loss of 588 points, the Dow\u2019s eighth-worst single-day point decline.",

The Shanghai Composite\u2019s falls continued despite a US$24bn injection of liquidity by China\u2019s central bank on Tuesday.</p> <p>Japan is concerned about the yen\u2019s rise against the dollar in recent days, as a stronger Japanese currency eats into the profits of Japanese automakers and other exporters. The finance minister, Taro Aso, said he hoped China would take action to stabilise its economy, but added that Tokyo had no immediate plans to introduce its own stimulus package.</p> <p>Aso later warned market players against pushing up the yen \u2013 seen as a \u201csafe haven\u201d currency\u201d \u2013 too much further, saying that its spike against the dollar overnight was problematic for Japan\u2019s economy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/aug/25/asian-stock-markets-braced-for-steep-falls-after-wall-street-slump-live\">Asian stock markets recover amid wild swings after Wall Street slump \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said there were no plans as yet for co-ordinated action among G7 and G20 countries. \u201cI would say [the yen\u2019s rises overnight] are rough, rather than rapid,\u201d Aso said. \u201cFor the economy to grow stably, it\u2019s better for [currency and stock price] moves to be gradual and steady, rather than rough.\u201d</p> <p>The economics minister, Akira Amari, said the flurry of yen buying was proof of Japan\u2019s sound economic fundamentals, adding that it was up to the Bank of Japan to decide whether or not to ease monetary policy with more quantitative easing to force the yen back down. The yen surged nearly 5% to a seven-month high against the dollar on Monday as investors worried about the slowdown in China bought the relatively risk-free Japanese currency.</p> <p>The dollar rebounded to the upper 119 yen zone later on Tuesday in Tokyo. At noon the US currency fetched 119.86-87 yen after plummeting to as low as 116.15 yen in New York overnight.</p> <p>All eyes were on how Chinese markets would respond throughout Tuesday, amid reports that the country\u2019s leadership is running out of ideas to stabilise the world\u2019s second-biggest economy.</p> <p>China is facing a slowdown in economic growth, the banking system is short of cash and investors are pulling money out of the country. Chinese shares led Monday\u2019s market meltdown, plunging more than 8% to post their biggest losses since 2007.</p> <p>\u201cA co-ordinated policy response is critical and much of this needs to come from Asian economies,\u201d said Bernard Aw at IG Markets. \u201cA spate of better economic news may help to allay concerns that global growth is not deteriorating. Certainly improvements in the Chinese economy will be welcomed.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Williams of Capital Economics said investors were \u201coverreacting\u201d to the economic risks in China. </p> <p>\u201cThe surge in prices that started a year ago was speculative, rather than driven by any improvement in fundamentals,\u201d Williams said. \u201cA combination of poor data and policy inaction in China may have triggered today\u2019s market falls but the bigger picture is that we are witnessing the inevitable implosion of an equity market bubble.\u201d</p> <p>Investors, worried that the Chinese economy is growing at a much slower pace than Beijing\u2019s 7% target for 2015, have also been spooked by uncertainty over US monetary policy. The heavy fall in share prices has tempered expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in September, according to some analysts.</p> <p>\u201cThere seems to be no consensus with the Fed on whether they are worried about acting too prematurely or too late,\u201d said Toru Yamamoto, chief bond strategist at Daiwa Securities. On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average briefly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/24/dow-us-stocks-down-black-monday\">fell more than 1,000 points</a> before mounting a recovery. Still, the day ended with a loss of 588 points, the Dow\u2019s eighth-worst single-day point decline.</p>",
