      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve (Fed) put any further increase in US interest rates on hold on Wednesday, announcing rates will remain unchanged for at least another month. The potential hike was postponed after fears of a slowdown in China and collapsing oil prices have rattled investors worldwide. In its statement, released at the end of its two-day March meeting, the Fed said that \u201cglobal economic and financial developments continue to pose risks\u201d and that \u201cinflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices\u201d. \u201cAgainst this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0.25% to 0.5%,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cThe stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2% inflation.\u201d During the press conference following the meeting, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen stressed that the Fed\u2019s \u201cpolicy is not on a pre-set course\u201d and that projections made by the committee are not promises. She also reiterated that every meeting is a live meeting, where the committee analyzes the most recent data. She would not rule out the possibility of an April rate hike. Yellen struck a cautious tone during the press conference, repeatedly using words such as \u201cprudent\u201d, \u201cgradual\u201d and \u201ccarefully monitor\u201d. Most economists expected Yellen to hint at two interest rate hikes to come later this year \u2013 down from four hikes that were expected back in December, when the Fed raised interest rates for the first time since 2006. The US central bank\u2019s rate hike was the first since the recession. At the time, Yellen said the economy \u201chas come a long way\u201d and that the Fed was going to proceed gradually. In the months since, the Fed has adjusted its outlook, signaling fewer interest rate hikes in 2016 as it continues to monitor the situation abroad, including volatile oil prices and uncertainty in China. There were some indications that the Fed would at least consider raising the interest rates at the March meeting. Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker \u2013 who is not a voting member of the Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee \u2013 said last month that recent job growth would justify multiple rate hikes this year. That same month, Kansas City Fed president Esther George, who is a voting member, said that the central bank should consider a rate hike in March. \u201cThe further improvement in labor market conditions and the jump in core inflation means that the economic data has given the Fed all the excuse it needs to raise rates today,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a financial intelligence provider. According to him, the chance of a March hike was small mainly due to the fact that the Fed is \u201creluctant to surprise investors\u201d. He added that not raising interest rates this month is a \u201cbig mistake\u201d. \u201cDr Yellen and her colleagues, in our view, are making the grave mistake of overweighting the importance of the manufacturing sector and the stock market ... Dr Yellen and her colleagues are focusing on events outside the US simply because they can,\u201d he said. \u201cThe domestic data, as of right now, are not unduly alarming.\u201d Most economists, however, predict that the next hike will be announced after the Fed meets 14-15 June. \u201cThe most prominent risk in January \u2013 the tightening in financial conditions at the start of the year \u2013 has receded,\u201d wrote Goldman Sachs economists Zach Pandl and Jan Hatzius. \u201cAs a result, Chair Yellen will likely indicate that the committee remains on track to raise rates again next quarter.\u201d Goldman Sachs economists are not the only ones who expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in the coming months. According to a recent Reuters survey, economists expect the next rate hike to come before the end of June, followed by one before the end of the year. About 60% of economists expect the next rate hike to come by mid-year. Inflation is the main reason why some expect the Fed to hold off on raising the interest rates in the coming months. The US inflation remains below the 2% target set out by the Fed and is not expected to rise near 2% even by mid-2017. When she testified in front of the US Congress in February, Yellen noted that US financial conditions have become less supportive of growth. Mainly, the Fed chair was concerned about the turmoil in the markets and said that if it were to continue, it could act as a brake on the economy and affect the jobs market. In January, the US unemployment rate dropped below 5% even as the number of jobs created in January fell short of expectations. By end of February, job creation was up once again and beat expectations with 242,000 jobs created.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Measures targeted at an army of overseas sellers using Amazon and eBay to evade VAT were at the heart of a \u00a312bn tax clampdown announced by the chancellor. A host of other tax avoidance strategies were also in George Osborne\u2019s sights. They ranged from schemes that disguised an individual\u2019s earnings as loans, to businesses taking on commercially unnecessary borrowings to lower their tax bills. He also signaled a determination to tackle multinational corporations using a complex international chain of intra-group royalty fees to shift taxable income from the UK to tax havens. Well-known multinationals, including Starbucks and McDonald\u2019s, have been accused of aggressively using royalty payments to shift taxable income from the UK. Many of the anti-avoidance measures paraded by Osborne on Wednesday had already been agreed last October as part of a programme of international reform organised through the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Among them was a cap on the tax deductions that companies can claim for interest payments arising from internal group loans. The prevalence of commercially pointless loans in tax planning was highlighted two years ago by the Luxleaks scandal. It showed how scores of multinationals were using billions of pounds of internal group lending, routed through Luxembourg, to avoid tax. On Wednesday, however, the chancellor made it clear that the UK would adopt only the mildest of reforms recommended the OECD \u2013 a club of rich nations \u2013 in an attempt to tackle this abuse. Nevertheless, the Treasury forecasts that caps on interest deductibility will generate \u00a33.97bn in extra tax over the next four years. There were meaures aimed at individuals too. Osborne announced fresh measures to tackle avoidance schemes that used so-called offshore \u201cemployee benefit trusts\u201d (EBTs). Tax planners have been building clever schemes using EBTs for many years, much to HMRC\u2019s frustration. Meanwhile, the chancellor said a crackdown on a raft of measures used by high earners to disguise their earnings as other income had generated \u00a3100m more than expected. However, industrious tax planners had begun finding new ways around the legislation, requiring another round of crackdowns in this area. Disguised earnings have been the cause of much embarrassment for high-profile celebrities in recent years, including the comedian Jimmy Carr. Responding to new VAT evasion challenges presented by the booming digital economy, Osborne said tax inspectors would be given new powers to warn overseas sellers active in the UK through eBay and Amazon. If, after those warnings, sellers did not collect VAT correctly within 30 days, then eBay and Amazon could be held liable for the missing tax. The Treasury estimates this measure will recoup \u00a3875m in lost VAT receipts over the next four years \u2013 although it is not expected to halt tax fraud altogether. The total cost to the taxpayer of this abuse was officially estimated at up to \u00a31.5bn a year. In Wednesday\u2019s budget speech, Osborne acknowledged there had been a big rise in overseas suppliers storing goods in Britain and selling them online without paying VAT. \u201cThat unfairly undercuts British businesses both on the internet and on the high street,\u201d he said. Responding to the move, eBay said it welcomed \u201crules that ensure a fair marketplace\u201d, but insisted it already took prompt action when alerted by HMRC to problem sellers not complying with VAT rules. It acknowledged there had been problems with Chinese sellers, but said: \u201cWe have contacted hundreds of Chinese sellers to notify and educate them on the need to comply with the law.\u201d In a statement, Amazon said: \u201cWe are currently reviewing the government\u2019s proposals, and we will naturally comply with any legislation.\u201d Alongside new powers to hold Amazon and eBay liable for tax evasion by sellers, the chancellor set out plans for a new \u201cfit and proper\u201d test for warehouse operators dealing with goods shipped to the UK for sale online. Warehouses will be required to be registered by 2018. They will have to be able to show they have made checks to ensure they are not facilitating VAT fraud for online sellers based overseas. For months, VAT campaigners have been calling for the government to hold Amazon and eBay liable for VAT fraud on their websites. While the chancellor has gone some way towards meeting their demands, they were disappointed that Amazon and eBay\u2019s potential liability would be restricted to only those cases flagged by HMRC. Campaigners said it was a mistake for the chancellor to task under-resourced UK tax inspectors with hunting down VAT evaders. Amazon and eBay are awash with hundreds of small pop-up sellers, based overseas, who are unlikely to be deterred if the new measures allow HMRC to catch only a small number of offenders. In a thinly veiled attack on his Labour predecessors, summing up his tax measures Osborne said: \u201cPeople talked about social justice but left enormous loopholes in our tax system for the very richest to exploit.\u201d The chancellor said he expected the \u00a312bn total to be raised by 2020.",

      "bodyText": "The North Sea oil industry, once a huge moneyspinner for the Treasury, is set to become a \u00a31bn burden for the taxpayer next year as the plunging crude price hits revenues. New forecasts from the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) show oil companies that were providing \u00a311bn of tax revenues as recently as 2012 will contribute zero in 2015-16, moving to minus \u00a31.1bn in 2016-17 - a loss that will be repeated annually until at least 2021. \u201cPayments of offshore corporation tax and petroleum revenue tax (PRT) will be lower and are likely to be dwarfed by repayments relating to [platform] decommissioning costs,\u201d said the OBR, adding that the burden would be made worse by oil companies posting losses. The analysis, which presumes oil prices will continue to remain low at around $44 per barrel in coming years, took account of further tax breaks in the budget George Osborne bowed to pressure from the hard-pressed North Sea industry by cutting taxes in a \u00a31bn move which delighted oil firms but infuriated climate change campaigners. The chancellor halved a supplementary charge levied on offshore fields and completely abolished a 30% petroleum revenue tax. \u201cThe oil and gas sector employs hundreds of thousands of people in Scotland and around our country,\u201d said Osborne. \u201cIn my budget a year ago, I made major reductions in taxes, but the oil price has continued to fall so we need to act now for the long term.\u201d Oil &amp; Gas UK, the lobby group, said the moves were \u201ca jolly good shove in the right direction\u201d at a time when the industry was facing a fight for survival as the crude price hovers around $40 a barrel. \u201cThere were very few exploration wells drilled in January and February,\u201d said Mike Tholen, economics director at Oil &amp; Gas UK. \u201cThis [tax break] is part of the answer but we must continue to reduce our costs and hope that the oil price recovers.\u201d Environmentalists said the extra help for oil companies jarred with a cut in state subsidies for renewable energy since the general election. Nina Skorupska, the chief executive of the Renewable Energy Association, said the government was protecting the most polluting industries despite committing to reducing global warming in last year\u2019s Paris climate talks. \u201cIf the government are serious about their national and international commitments, they need to back up the empty rhetoric with real actions,\u201d he said. Greenpeace said clean energy could power the UK in the future if it was given a \u201csliver\u201d of the financial and political backing that was received by the nuclear and fossil fuel industries. \u201cRather than hoping to extract more North Sea oil and gas, the government should be looking at a transition plan for the communities impacted by a declining industry including expanding offshore wind,\u201d said Doug Parr, the organisation\u2019s policy director. But Osborne said oil was a key industry for Britain that needed help during a difficult period. He also used the budget speech to deliver a clear political message to Scotland. It was only possible to provide these concessions \u201cbecause of the broad shoulders of the UK\u201d, he argued \u2013 a clear suggestion that the industry would have been in a bigger crisis had Scotland, with its much smaller oil-based economy, voted for independence. A Treasury briefing note said the North Sea had paid a total of \u00a3330bn in production taxes to date, supported 375,000 jobs and boosted the UK\u2019s balance of payments to the tune of \u00a325bn every year. But some oil experts said Osborne had not done nearly enough, especially after having previously raised taxes on the industry. Energy analysts at investment bank Barclays said: \u201cWe do not believe the tax changes materially alter the outlook for the North Sea, or indeed asset valuations amongst small and mid cap [medium-size] exploration and production companies.\u201d David Blumenthal, senior tax associate at law firm Clyde &amp; Co, said: \u201cWhile tax cuts for the oil and gas industry are welcome, given the stagnating oil price and fears that we may yet see it fall further before any recovery, there is a sense that whatever the chancellor does now could be a case of \u2018too little, too late\u2019 \u2013 especially in view of the blows he dealt the industry at the beginning of his chancellorship.\u201d Osborne used a budget five years ago to raise the supplementary charge on oilfields from 20% to 32%. He was roundly criticised by the Aberdeen industry which warned it could lead to a big fall in investment. Exploration levels did fall and then were made worse when the price of Brent blend oil started to fall from a high of $115 per barrel in June 2014 to less than $30. It has since recovered slightly to $40. In the run-up to the budget, Oil &amp; Gas UK said about 14bn barrels of an estimated 20bn barrels of oil lying beneath the UK continental shelf in the North Sea would not be extracted unless conditions for the industry improved.",

      "bodyText": "Asda has confirmed plans to cut up to 500 jobs in stores and 250 at its head office in Leeds as the retailer battles to protect profits while sales slide. The supermarket chain is to close staff canteens in all stores and axe some shopfloor services such as photo processing and pizza-making as part of a turnaround plan called Project Renewal. Asda began consulting 5,000 store staff and about 1,000 head office personnel over potential changes to their jobs in January. On Wednesday, the retailer said the majority of those staff had been redeployed but about 200 store workers had already taken redundancy and up to a further 300 were likely to go \u2013 less than the 1,000 feared. About 250 jobs are going at its head office in Leeds \u2013 slightly more than the 200 expected. Asda said that after consultation with staff about canteen closures it would be offering free tea and coffee in all stores and giving workers an extra 10% discount on takeaway food, such as sandwiches, on top of their regular 10% staff discount. The company previously attracted heavy criticism with plans to eliminate the morning perk of free tea and toast handed out to staff across 230 stores. The supermarket is looking for ways to trim costs as it battles against discounters Aldi and Lidl, which have undermined its position as the UK\u2019s cheapest supermarket. Andy Clarke, its chief executive, has said he wants to halve the price gap with the German chains to 5% over the next two years under his Project Renewal scheme. Last month, Asda revealed its worst-ever quarterly sales fall \u2013 with sales down 5.8% at established stores in the 13 weeks to 1 January. It was the sixth consecutive quarter of declining sales for Asda and marked it as the worst performer of all the major grocers over the all-important Christmas period. Clarke said: \u201cThis is a business in financial control and in charge of the decisions we are making not a business in crisis.\u201d But he warned that Asda was likely to see continuing falls in underlying sales this year at it steps up price cuts and steers clear of heavy discounts in its attempt to win over shoppers in the long term. Asda said: \u201cWe have announced big changes in the way we run our business and some of these changes have inevitably impacted a small proportion of our 140,000 UK colleagues ... With flexibility on both sides we have been able to achieve the necessary changes with the active support of staff.\u201d Asda\u2019s job cuts come after Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis warned that retail jobs were at risk from rising costs. He threw his weight behind a report by the British Retail Consortium that said there could be 900,000 fewer jobs in retail by 2025 as costs including business rates and the national minimum wage rise. Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s have all cut staff in the past few years as they have been forced to cut prices to take on the discounters.",

    "webTitle": "Shaw report: Network Rail's breakup and privatisation rejected", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The wholesale privatisation and breakup of Network Rail has been ruled out by a critical review, which argued for more devolution in the running of the railways rather than full-scale reform. However, the report by Nicola Shaw, the chief executive of HS1, left open the possibility of bringing more private finance into the running of the railways, at local level or for specific projects. Shaw said there should be a greater focus on the \u201cneeds of the customer\u201d \u2013 train operators and passengers \u2013 with the railways lacking the \u201clocal flexibility and autonomy\u201d required. This could be done by further changes to the flow of funding, with train firms paying for devolved routes to use the tracks, and having a bigger say in how the railways are run. A new, dedicated route for the north should be created, bringing the west and east coast mainlines under more local control where they cross the region. The report said that Network Rail\u2019s structures did not give \u201csufficient focus on financial discipline\u201d and that the government\u2019s role needed to be clarified, with more transparent accountability, and more input from local authorities. The report said it dismissed privatisation, with most of more than 10,000 individual submissions in its consultation opposing it, thousands of which were generated by supporters of the Campaign for Better Transport and We Own It campaigns. But the report recommended that Network Rail continue to explore alternative financing, and suggested that profitable lines such as the Wessex route \u2013 largely serving South West trains \u2013 could be managed as long-term concessions. However, well-placed sources said there was little enthusiasm within the Department for Transport or the Treasury to pursue the idea, which would be kicked into the long grass for now. Despite raising the idea, the report highlights the disastrous experience of Metronet, whose contract to run London Underground infrastructure ended with the firm in administration and huge costs for the taxpayer. In its budget statement, the government said it welcomed the Shaw recommendations and would respond fully later this year. It said it would also work with the Competition and Markets Authority to explore how its recent recommendations \u2013 to overhaul franchising and encourage train operators to run competing services on the same line \u2013 could potentially be implemented. Mark Carne, Network Rail chief executive, said: \u201cI\u2019m pleased that [Shaw] has concluded that the reforms we are introducing in Network Rail are the right ones. We are committed to putting passengers and customers at the heart of what we do and our devolved business model will put decisions in the routes, closer to the passengers and train companies. \u201cI also endorse her desire to see more private finance coming into the railways. I consider that more private money and funding from the people who will benefit from railway improvements is a sensible way to deliver a bigger and better railway.\u201d Unions gave a cautious welcome to the conclusion that privatisation was off the table. The Trade Union Congress\u2019s general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said there were many sensible recommendations in the Shaw report, adding: \u201cEveryone wants to see greater democracy and transparency in the way our railways are run. \u201cBut any move towards local devolution, or to increase private investment, must not lead to further fragmentation of our rail network. Nor can it allow privatisation by the back door.\u201d The Rail, Maritime and Transport union warned that the sale of assets could lead to further fragmentation. Mick Cash, the RMT general secretary, said: \u201cForeign speculators will be queuing up again to plunder Britain\u2019s railways for every last penny in the same way as they have mopped up train operations and run them into the ground. RMT will continue to fight any further attacks on Network Rail and will continue to campaign for public ownership of the entire rail system.\u201d Shaw\u2019s review was commissioned by the Treasury at the 2015 budget, soon after the admission that Network Rail would fail to deliver the upgrades in its \u00a338bn five-year plan, after overspending on electrification work. The embarrassment of abandoning manifesto pledges of major rail upgrades \u2013 including some relating to the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d championed by the chancellor, George Osborne \u2013 saw the state-owned rail infrastructure operator in the line of fire. But a review by Network Rail\u2019s new chairman, Peter Hendy, reached a compromise with Osborne finding another \u00a3700m while more funds were pledged from Network Rail selling off assets such as property and retail space.",

This could be done by further changes to the flow of funding, with train firms paying for devolved routes to use the tracks, and having a bigger say in how the railways are run.<br></p> <p> A new, dedicated route for the north should be created, bringing the west and east coast mainlines under more local control where they cross the region. The report said that Network Rail\u2019s structures did not give \u201csufficient focus on financial discipline\u201d and that the government\u2019s role needed to be clarified, with more transparent accountability, and more input from local authorities.</p> <p>The report said it dismissed privatisation, with most of more than 10,000 individual submissions in its consultation opposing it, thousands of which were generated by supporters of the Campaign for Better Transport and We Own It campaigns. But the report recommended that Network Rail continue to explore alternative financing, and suggested that profitable lines <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/08/public-private-ownership-britain-railways-privatisation-nationalisation\">such as the Wessex route</a> \u2013 largely serving South West trains \u2013 could be managed as long-term concessions. </p> <p>However, well-placed sources said there was little enthusiasm within the Department for Transport or the Treasury to pursue the idea, which would be kicked into the long grass for now.

Back in January, the chancellor looked ridiculous as he hailed the \u00a3130m deal as a \u201cmajor success\u201d while almost everybody else concluded the sum, covering a 10-year period, was a mere trifle. Worse, the settlement seemed to be yet more evidence of multinationals\u2019 ability to duck and weave around the tax system. In this budget, Osborne avoided rash boasts about, say, declaring war on footloose financial engineers. Instead, there were sober lines about creating \u201ca modern tax code that better reflects the reality of the global economy\u201d. Yet look at the some of sums he expects to raise. They put past promises about tackling tax avoiders in the shade. The modernisation effort on corporation tax, for example, is due to bring an extra \u00a39bn for the Treasury in this parliament. Within that tally, there are some chunky individual sums. Restricting the tax-deductibility of interest payments \u2013 in effect hitting companies that borrow heavily in the UK to finance operations overseas \u2013 will raise almost \u00a34bn. An attack on \u201chybrid mismatch\u201d schemes, which are designed to bury expenses in complexity, will produce \u00a3950m, or so we are told. Then there is \u00a312bn to come from measures to \u201cstop tax evasion, prevent tax avoidance and tackle imbalances in the system\u201d. Merely stopping overseas firms flogging goods on Amazon and eBay without paying VAT is due to bring in \u00a3875m over the parliament. Why was the chancellor so shy about trumpeting these apparently large sums? Two reasons, one suspects. First, all promises to tackle tax avoidance arrive cloaked with uncertainty. Does HMRC even have the resources to catch those traders fiddling their VAT bills on eBay? Second, never underestimate multinationals\u2019 ability to find new loopholes. If the window is closing on the tax-deductibility of interest payments, firms will look for other mechanisms. For all that, the spirit of the reform should be cheered. The attack on abuses by big businesses will fund, in part, a giveaway to small businesses, who are the winners from the changes to business rates. That is an entirely reasonable reform if your ambition is to encourage startups and entrepreneurs. Accountants EY calculated that the small firms will enjoy 95% of the \u00a36.7bn cut (again, over the life of the parliament) in business rates while bigger employers will have to make do with the modest sop of a shift in indexation from RPI to CPI. But here\u2019s the rub. As so often with Osborne\u2019s budgets, the giveaways \u2013 like allowing 600,000 small businesses to pay no business rates at all from next April \u2013 are backed by solid numbers. The revenue is definitely lost to the Treasury. By contrast, the balancing revenue-raising measures, like the clampdown on tax avoiders, contain assumptions, conjecture and hope. Maybe the money will arrive. Maybe it won\u2019t. Osborne, in effect, is betting that he can halt the shifting sands of the UK\u2019s corporate tax base. On past form, that\u2019s a tricky job. When the figures are now as large as \u00a39bn and \u00a312bn, it\u2019s a mighty gamble. Fuelling around with duties Fuel duty has become the tax that must never be touched. If the chancellor cannot raise it in current climate of low oil prices \u2013 when we are still marvelling at petrol and diesel costing less than a pound a litre at the pumps \u2013 he never will. Instead, the backdoor device for hitting motorists has become insurance premium tax. The pre-budget rumours suggested a hike to 12%. In the event, the increase was from 9.5% to 10%. But, given that the rate was 6% a year ago, that is still a hefty jump. One has to admire the political art. Buying insurance \u2013 whether for the car, home or vet\u2019s bills \u2013 is an annual transaction for most consumers. The extra cost is swallowed uncomfortably, but only once a year. Filling up with petrol, by contrast, can be weekly event for some motorists. Osborne would prefer not to be the chancellor who chose to abolish 99p-a-litre petrol almost the moment it arrived. The insurers were relieved at 10% but shouldn\u2019t celebrate too merrily. Insurance premium tax is now a permanently easy source of cash for a chancellor to tap. This time, Osborne cited the need to spend an extra \u00a3700m on flood defences. That, at least, has a direct connection with home insurance.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley has been handed his second Westminster ultimatum of the week, with MPs threatening to pull out of a planned visit to Sports Direct\u2019s warehouse unless the billionaire agrees to appear in front of a parliamentary select committee. The move comes after it emerged on Tuesday that the Sports Direct founder is to be formally summonsed by MPs to be questioned on his company\u2019s treatment of its workers. He will be issued with a demand to appear before the business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee on 7 June after refusing to agree to a number of suggested dates. Ashley has consistently resisted appearing in front of the committee and has instead asked its members to travel to visit him at the group\u2019s headquarters in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. Separately, local Labour MPs had agreed to meet Ashley at the depot on Monday but, in a letter signed by Labour\u2019s Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover, Toby Perkins, MP for Chesterfield, and Gloria de Piero, MP for Ashfield, they are now threatening to pull out. The letter states: \u201cWe would be grateful if you could confirm that you will be making an appointment to answer questions from the BIS select committee in advance of our meeting on Monday 21 March ... or, regrettably, we will have to reschedule. \u201cTo be clear, we are not prepared to meet at the facility in Shirebrook until you have set a date to respond to the BIS select committee\u201d. Perkins added that the MPs had arranged \u201cin good faith\u201d to meet Ashley to discuss their concerns about how the retailer\u2019s working practices affect their constituents, but that the private meeting should not be used to \u201cavoid public scrutiny\u201d. He added: \u201cUnless he confirms his intention to attend the select committee, we won\u2019t be holding the private meeting in an effort to make sure that the practices and concerns at Shirebrook don\u2019t go unscrutinised and don\u2019t become the norm in the British workplace.\u201d The move is the latest development in a spat between Ashley and MPs. They are anxious to investigate the retailer\u2019s treatment of workers following a Guardian investigation last year that revealed warehouse staff were effectively earning less than the minimum wage. Last week, Ashley accused the BIS committee of being \u201cdeliberately antagonistic\u201d and abusing parliamentary procedure by trying to force him to give evidence. In a letter to Iain Wright, the committee\u2019s chairman, the Newcastle United FC owner said he was disgusted by the MPs\u2019 approach. That came after the committee warned him publicly last week that he risked being in contempt of parliament if he failed to appear. Wright wrote to Ashley saying the committee wanted to ask him about his company\u2019s treatment of staff, enforcement of the minimum wage and the progress of an internal review of Sports Direct\u2019s practices, which Ashley said he would oversee personally as a response to the Guardian\u2019s reports. The standoff is the second time Ashley has resisted attempts to make him appear before MPs. He declined an invitation to attend the Scottish affairs select committee last year, explaining he was busy on the dates suggested. Instead, the company sent its chairman, Keith Hellawell, who struggled to answer detailed questions. The company has been branded a \u201cscar on British business\u201d by the Institute of Directors and accused of \u201coperating Dickensian practices\u201d by the union Unite, which has been running a campaign to highlight the group\u2019s treatment of staff.

He will be issued with a demand to appear before the business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee on 7 June after refusing to agree to a number of suggested dates.<br></p> <p>Ashley has consistently resisted appearing in front of the committee and has instead asked its members to travel to visit him at the group\u2019s headquarters in Shirebrook, Derbyshire.</p> <p>Separately, local Labour MPs had agreed to meet Ashley at the depot on Monday but, in a letter signed by Labour\u2019s Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover, Toby Perkins, MP for Chesterfield, and Gloria de Piero, MP for Ashfield, they are now threatening to pull out.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The letter states: \u201cWe would be grateful if you could confirm that you will be making an appointment to answer questions from the BIS select committee in advance of our meeting on Monday 21 March ... or, regrettably, we will have to reschedule.<br></p> <p>\u201cTo be clear, we are not prepared to meet at the facility in Shirebrook until you have set a date to respond to the BIS select committee\u201d.</p> <p>Perkins added that the MPs had arranged \u201cin good faith\u201d to meet Ashley to discuss their concerns about how the retailer\u2019s working practices affect their constituents, but that the private meeting should not be used to \u201cavoid public scrutiny\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cUnless he confirms his intention to attend the select committee, we won\u2019t be holding the private meeting in an effort to make sure that the practices and concerns at Shirebrook don\u2019t go unscrutinised and don\u2019t become the norm in the British workplace.\u201d</p> <p>The move is the latest development in a spat between Ashley and MPs.

      "bodyText": "A surprise reduction in capital gains tax has been welcomed by investors but is expected to prompt outrage from buy-to-let landlords after residential property was exempted from the changes. The headline rates of CGT \u2013 which is paid on profits from asset sales \u2013 will be cut on 6 April from 18% to 10% for basic rate taxpayers and from 28% to 20% for higher rate taxpayers. \u201cWe want people to invest in our businesses and help them create jobs. The best way to encourage that is to let them keep more of the rewards when that investment is successful,\u201d said George Osborne. But there was a sting in the tail for buy-to-let landlords and other property investors in the form of an 8% surcharge to be paid on residential property - which effectively means it will continue to be taxed at the current higher rates. \u201cThis will ensure that CGT provides an incentive to invest in companies over property,\u201d said the Treasury. CGT is paid at a basic or higher rate depending on the rate of income tax that the individual pays. CGT on residential property does not apply to an individual\u2019s main home but is imposed on any additional properties such as a buy-to-let investment. Investing in buy-to-let has been a popular way to make money for two decades, but many experts say that a raft of tax changes already introduced by the government will make it far less profitable and several commentators said the latest announcement was a new kick in the teeth. David Cox, managing director of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, said: \u201cThis is now the third budget which directly attacks landlords. The sector has been punitively taxed, with stamp duty on buy-to-let properties, mortgage interest relief and now capital gains tax changes. It\u2019s an outright assault on the sector.\u201d James Ward, partner and head of private client at law firm Seddons, said: \u201cOnce again the chancellor has demonstrated his quite clear disdain for people making money out of the property market.\u201d Accountancy group Deloitte pointed out that the changes affected relatively few taxpayers. There are about 400,000 individuals and trusts paying CGT, compared with about 30 million income taxpayers. Nevertheless, the announcement was described as a \u201cshot in the arm\u201d for the stock market. David Kilshaw, a partner at Ernst &amp; Young, said the main winners were investors in stocks and shares. The changes would enable all investors to benefit by realising the profit on the sale of shares and other assets at the reduced rate, said KPMG. \u201cNot only do these very substantial reductions bring us close to the position in 2008, they are also forecast to cost the Treasury \u00a32.8bn over the next five years,\u201d it said. In his budget speech in the House of Commons, Osborne said he wanted to take action because \u201cour capital gains tax is now one of the highest in the developed world, when we want our taxes to be among the lowest\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Indigenous opponents of Adani\u2019s Carmichael mine have vowed to ramp up their legal fight against the project despite fresh progress by the miner and its endorsement by the Queensland parliament. Representatives of the Wangan and Jagalingou people, the traditional owners of the site of Australia\u2019s largest proposed coalmine, are considering a series of high court and federal court actions to broaden their unfolding battle against the Indian miner. Adani\u2019s failure to secure an Indigenous land use agreement (ILUA) with the Wangan and Jagalingou continues to pose a key obstacle for the project, as financiers may be reluctant to invest because of the risk of being exposed to legal action around native title rights. Adani on Wednesday announced it had finalised compensation agreements with landholders on the site, overcoming another hurdle to gaining a mining lease from the Queensland government. Queensland\u2019s mining minister, Anthony Lynham, cited the importance of securing those agreements in parliament on Tuesday, where the Palaszczuk government supported a motion by the Liberal National opposition calling for approval of the $21.7bn project. But members of the Wangan and Jagalingou people hours earlier flagged their continued resistance to Adani, saying they would \u201ctake the fight up a notch\u201d. Guardian Australia understands Wangan and Jagalingou representatives are exploring grounds for a new high court action, separate from an unresolved federal court challenge to a native title tribunal ruling that the Queensland government can override the group\u2019s native title rights and approve the mining lease in the public interest. Wangan and Jagalingou representatives are also considering a separate federal court action around Adani\u2019s attempts to negotiate an ILUA, which they claim are \u201cunauthorised and invalid\u201d. Without an ILUA, the project draws the risk of future legal action because the Queensland government would need to extinguish or impair native title rights to issue a mining lease to a private company. In an online post on Tuesday, Wangan and Jagalingou representatives including current federal court challenger Adrian Burragubba accused the miner of being \u201crude and obstinate \u2013 so we will take the fight up a notch\u201d. \u201cWe are planning more action in the courts and will take this fight all the way,\u201d it said. Adani suffered a blow to a cornerstone of its north Queensland project, its investment in the related Abbot Point coal terminal, on Monday. Global ratings house Moody\u2019s downgraded its credit rating and noted a \u201cnegative outlook\u201d for the port, which is likely to affect its ability to borrow money to expand the port to put through coal from the Carmichael mine. Moody\u2019s cited an \u201congoing severe pressure facing the coal sector\u201d that made cash-flow problems for Adani more likely as other miners using the port risked going to the wall amid a glum outlook for coal prices. \u201cMoody\u2019s believes that the current coal market downturn is structural in nature, with weak conditions likely to persist,\u201d it said. \u201cSuch conditions will continually erode the [Adani customers\u2019] financial capacity over time, increasing the likelihood of a default.\u201d The fact other miners were not using its full 50m tonne a year capacity meant investors in Adani\u2019s port enterprise risked \u201clower recovery rates \u2026 in the hypothetical event\u201d of it defaulting. Lynham told parliament the government\u2019s position remained that it would not allow dredging for Abbot Point \u201cuntil Adani demonstrates it has the necessary finance in place for the full mine, rail and port project\u201d. But it \u201cstrongly supports the sustainable development of the Galilee Basin for the jobs and economic development it could provide for regional Queensland\u201d, he said. \u201cFor that reason the government and the independent coordinator general have been working closely with Adani to facilitate their approvals in accordance with statutory obligations,\u201d he said. But the projects\u2019 mining leases could only be approved when compensation agreements were reached, he said. The chief executive of the Queensland resources council, Michael Roche, said on Wednesday the finalisation of compensation agreements was \u201cyet another milestone as these important projects continue to progress\u201d. \u201cAnd as the QRC has regularly stated, these important economic opportunities benefit all Queenslanders, not just those in the regions,\u201d Roche said. The LNP said it had successfully pressured the government to support the motion after Lynham had \u201cdragged the chain on granting a mining lease\u201d. The opposition\u2019s state development and mines spokesman, Andrew Cripps, said consideration of the mining lease would have been completed \u201cas a matter of urgency and the project could have been up and running long ago\u201d were the LNP still in power. \u201cIt was the LNP who gave approval to the Carmichael mine after two years of Adani\u2019s negotiations going nowhere with the previous Bligh Labor government, which was also captured by green activist groups,\u201d Cripps said.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne\u2019s hopes of securing a budget surplus by the time of the next general election rest on continuing high levels of net migration to Britain, the Office for Budget Responsibility has made clear. The OBR\u2019s latest economic and fiscal outlook published on Wednesday renews its finding that net migration has a positive impact on the British economy and says that a \u201chigh level\u201d of net migration of 265,000 a year will fuel growth by \u00a34.5bn by 2019-20 and \u00a36bn by 2020-2021. It also underlines that the chancellor\u2019s hopes of achieving a budget surplus is directly at odds with the home secretary\u2019s policy of reducing net migration from its current level of 320,000 a year to the \u201ctens of thousands\u201d by the time of the next election. Should net migration fall below 100,000 by 2019-20 \u201cthe surplus in 2019-20 would fall closer to zero\u201d, the OBR said. The point was underlined by the OBR\u2019s chairman, Robert Chote, who said his organisation\u2019s view that Osborne would secure a budget surplus of \u00a310bn was dependent on different assumptions about net inward migration. The analysis suggests that a \u201clow migration scenario\u201d would cut economic output and the size of the economy by 0.8% and lower house prices by 1.3%. A \u201chigh migration scenario\u201d would add 0.8% to economic growth and increase house prices by 1.3%. The clear implication is that the government will either miss its 100,000 net migration target or fail to secure a budget surplus by the next election, implying possible extra tax rises or further spending cuts. \u201cHigher inward net migration is generally positive for the public finances,\u201d Chote said, while presenting the OBR\u2019s budget analysis \u201cbecause inward migrants are more likely to be of working age than the native population \u2026 We estimate that the high migration variant would increase the budget surplus by about \u00a34.5bn by 2019-20, while the low migration variant would reduce it by the same amount. This is not to suggest that we recommend any particular level of migration or that the government could not offset different outcomes with tax and benefit changes.\u201d The assumption that high levels of net migration have a positive impact on the British economy rests on the basis that migrants of working-age pay more tax and receive fewer benefits. The OBR\u2019s central forecast of net migration of 329,000 in 2015 declining to 185,000 by 2021 is based on projections by the Office for National Statistics, which reflect the average levels of net migration for the past 20 years, which are much lower than in the past five years. When asked about net migration figures breaching the official 100,000 target, Treasury officials said the numbers represented \u201cscenarios, not forecasts\u201d.",

The timing of the deal \u2013 before a UK referendum where a vote to leave the EU could herald regulatory and legislative upheaval in financial services \u2013 is fundamentally odd but nothing talks like substantial cost savings.

      "bodyText": "Tesco has asked managers to use basic courtesies with their staff as part of efforts to turn around the struggling supermarket chain. Managers are being encouraged to say please and thank you to employees and praise them when they have done a good job, in an attempt to encourage better customer service. Matt Davies, chief executive of Tesco\u2019s UK and Irish business, said: \u201cIt is about celebrating success and the power of appreciation. There is power in saying thank you and of spotting somebody doing a job well and appreciating that.\u201d He said Tesco had not sent a missive demanding certain actions, but had communicated a change of culture through staff workshops and conferences and in the way senior management dealt with colleagues. \u201cThis is not about a training programme but developing a culture of appreciating one another,\u201d said Davies. He added that the initiative was part of Tesco\u2019s aim of rebuilding trust in the brand laid out by chief executive Dave Lewis, who was brought in 18 months ago after Tesco suffered a dive in sales and profits. Shortly after Lewis arrived, he revealed a multimillion-pound accounting scandal which has led to investigations by the Serious Fraud Office and the grocery industry regulator. Last year the company revealed the biggest loss in its history. Tesco has since rewritten the way it deals with suppliers, cut prices and slashed costs by sacking thousands of head office staff as well as revamping the management team as it tries to win back shoppers. \u201cRebuilding trust is a core part of what we need to do \u2013 rebuilding trust with colleagues, customers and the nation at large \u2013 and that will take a period of time and will follow from running our business the right way,\u201d said Davies, as he marked his first year at Tesco with his first public speech at the Retail Week Live conference in London. Davies said he had no regrets about leaving his post as chief executive of the bikes to car parts retailer Halfords and he had been surprised by the warmth of the company culture at Tesco. \u201cI don\u2019t think that warmth is apparent from the outside and part of our challenge is how we demonstrate how much we really care to the nation,\u201d he said. He said he believed Tesco was \u201con the cusp of doing something special\u201d after reporting its first underlying sales growth in four years over Christmas. \u201cOn every key measure of great service, customers are more positive about Tesco than they\u2019ve been for years,\u201d said Davies. He said customer service was just as important as price, quality and products. There are hopes that 2016 could be a better year for Britain\u2019s big supermarkets, which have been hit by a price war spurred by rising competition from Aldi and Lidl. On Tuesday, Sainsbury\u2019s revealed its first quarterly sales growth for more than two years, and last week Morrisons announced its first quarterly rise in underlying sales for four years. But Davies said Tesco expected the market to remain tough and its recovery strategy was not based on any easing of competitive pressures. \u201cIs it getting any easier? No, not really. It\u2019s still a tough market and being hard-fought right across the UK,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>Tesco has asked managers to use basic courtesies with their staff as part of efforts to turn around the struggling supermarket chain. </p> <p>Managers are being encouraged to say please and thank you to employees and praise them when they have done a good job, in an attempt to encourage better customer service.</p> <p>Matt Davies, chief executive of Tesco\u2019s UK and Irish business, said: \u201cIt is about celebrating success and the power of appreciation. There is power in saying thank you and of spotting somebody doing a job well and appreciating that.\u201d</p> <p>He said Tesco had not sent a missive demanding certain actions, but had communicated a change of culture through staff workshops and conferences and in the way senior management dealt with colleagues.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not about a training programme but developing a culture of appreciating one another,\u201d said Davies.<br></p> <p>He added that the initiative was part of Tesco\u2019s aim of rebuilding trust in the brand laid out by chief executive Dave Lewis, who was brought in 18 months ago after Tesco suffered a dive in sales and profits. </p> <p>Shortly after Lewis arrived, he revealed a multimillion-pound accounting scandal which has led to investigations by the Serious Fraud Office and the grocery industry regulator. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/22/tesco-suffers-record-64bn-loss\">Last year the company revealed the biggest loss in its history</a>.</p> <p>Tesco has since rewritten the way it deals with suppliers, cut prices and slashed costs by sacking thousands of head office staff as well as revamping the management team as it tries to win back shoppers.</p> <p>\u201cRebuilding trust is a core part of what we need to do \u2013 rebuilding trust with colleagues, customers and the nation at large \u2013 and that will take a period of time and will follow from running our business the right way,\u201d said Davies, as he marked his first year at Tesco with his first public speech at the <a href=\"https://live.retail-week.com/\">Retail Week Live conference</a> in London.</p> <p>Davies said he had no regrets about leaving his post as chief executive of the bikes to car parts retailer Halfords and he had been surprised by the warmth of the company culture at Tesco. \u201cI don\u2019t think that warmth is apparent from the outside and part of our challenge is how we demonstrate how much we really care to the nation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said he believed Tesco was \u201con the cusp of doing something special\u201d after reporting its first underlying sales growth in four years over Christmas. \u201cOn every key measure of great service, customers are more positive about Tesco than they\u2019ve been for years,\u201d said Davies. He said customer service was just as important as price, quality and products.</p> <p>There are hopes that 2016 could be a better year for Britain\u2019s big supermarkets, which have been hit by a price war spurred by rising competition from Aldi and Lidl.<br></p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/15/sainsburys-sales-rebound-boosts-home-retail-group-prospects\">Sainsbury\u2019s revealed its first quarterly sales growth for more than two years</a>, and last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/morrisons-returns-to-profit-as-sales-start-to-rise\">Morrisons announced its first quarterly rise in underlying sales for four years</a>.</p> <p>But Davies said Tesco expected the market to remain tough and its recovery strategy was not based on any easing of competitive pressures. \u201cIs it getting any easier? No, not really. It\u2019s still a tough market and being hard-fought right across the UK,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Simon Nixon, the university dropout turned multimillionaire co-founder of Moneysupermarket.com, has sold the final tranche of his shareholding in the comparison website for \u00a3124m. Nixon offloaded his remaining 6.9% stake on Wednesday for 328p a share. The move prompted the company\u2019s share price to dip by about 5% to 326p. The \u00a3124m raised by Nixon brings his total from selling his stake over the last few years to more than \u00a3700m. Nixon created the site with Duncan Cameron in 1999 at the height of the dotcom boom, when he quit his accountancy course at Nottingham University because it was boring. Cameron disposed of his 50% stake in the business before its stock market listing in 2007. Originally the site specialised in comparing the best mortgage deals before expanding its activities to financial and energy services. In 2012 it acquired the MoneySavingExpert site, created by Martin Lewis, for \u00a387m. Nixon has been steadily reducing his stake in the business and stepped down as chief executive in 2008 but continued to play an active role as executive then non-executive deputy chairman. He severed his management connection with the company when he reliquished that role at the end of 2015. However, as Moneysupermarket\u2019s second-biggest investor, Nixon\u2019s plans for his remaining stake weighed on the stock market. That uncertainty was removed after Credit Suisse organised the sale of Nixon\u2019s remaining 38m shares. He moved to Jersey in 2012 and as a consequence paid no capital gains tax on subsequent share sales. However, he is reported to be considering a further move in search of warmer weather. Nixon owns a property in Barbados that is part of the portfolio of luxury apartments he rents out as part of his SimonEscapes holidays business. The portfolio includes properties in the Cotswolds, Cornwall, the Lake District and Deia in Mallorca, which is pictured as part of the backdrop to The Night Manager, the BBC drama based on the eponymous John le Carr\u00e9 novel.",

      "bodyText": "Oil companies, housebuilders and investment companies were boosted by chancellor George Osborne\u2019s budget speech, but news of a sugar tax sent soft drinks firms tumbling. The FTSE 100 rose from 6144 at the start of Osborne\u2019s speech to close at 6175.49, up 35.52 points on the day, as business welcomed the proposed cuts in corporation tax. Oil companies moved higher after news of tax changes for the North Sea oil sector, with BP up 2% to 350.1p, Royal Dutch Shell A shares 2.7% better at 1703.5p, Tullow Oil adding nearly 8% to 207.2p, Cairn Energy climbing 6.7% to 204.5p and oil services business Wood Group rising 2.6% to 634.5p. The chancellor said he was halving the supplementary charge on oil and gas from 20% to 10% and effectively abolishing the Petroleum Revenue Tax, which together should save the industry around \u00a31bn over the next five years. Housebuilders benefited from proposals to encourage construction of new homes on brownfield land, as well as the lack of any new taxes or levies on the sector. Taylor Wimpey was up 3.4% at 187.6p, Crest Nicholson climbed 4% to 551p, and Barratt Developments was 3% better at 572.5p. News of the increase to ISA savings limits lifted investment groups Hargreaves Lansdown, up nearly 1% at \u00a313.04, St James\u2019s Place, 3.8% higher at 934.5p, and Brewin Dolphin, 0.5% better at 260.9p. Bookmakers were relieved there were no new measures announced that would dampen their business, given talk of changes in the racing levy. Ladbrokes was up 6% at 121.7p and William Hill 4% to 379.6p. Insurers also moved higher after the much-mooted rise in insurance premium tax of 0.5% was lower than expected. Motor specialist Admiral added 12p to \u00a319 while Aviva was up 1.4% at 482.9p. Pubs groups toasted the freeze in beer and cider duty, with Greene King up 1.2% to 860p and JD Wetherspoon 1.4% higher at 700p. But the sugar tax on drinks left Irn Bru maker AG Barr 2.4% lower at 540.5p and Britvic down 1.3% to 699.5p, while Vimto company Nichols fell 6.5% to \u00a312.19. The levy, designed to help tackle childhood obesity, will raise up to \u00a3520m which will go towards funding sport in schools. Tate &amp; Lyle was also 1% lower at 564.5p but came off its worst levels as investors realised it had sold its sugar business although it still makes artificial sweetener Splenda. In the currency markets the pound fell from $1.4081 to $1.4064 during the speech but was steady against the euro. The move in the dollar came ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve decision on interest rates. No increase is expected this month, but investors expect the central bank to give an update on when a rate hike might come.",

      "bodyText": "Deutsche B\u00f6rse and the London Stock Exchange said they expected to cut costs by \u20ac450m (\u00a3354m) a year as they sought to press on with their agreed \u00a320bn deal and ward off a potential rival bid from the US. The exchanges set out the terms and benefits of what they described as a merger of equals. As expected, Deutsche B\u00f6rse shareholders will own 54.4% of the new company with LSE shareholders owning the remainder. After the potential deal was announced last month, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, revealed it was considering making a rival offer for LSE. ICE was reported to have hired investment bankers to advise on a potential deal and Chicago\u2019s CME Group was also said to be watching events with a view to making a bid. Carsten Kengeter, Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cICE caused some speculation and have confirmed that they have a certain interest in LSE but that is all they did. What we have here is an agreed merger of equals. This is what we are doing and we are not going to be diverted by anything or anybody else.\u201d The planned deal is the third time Deutsche B\u00f6rse and LSE have tried to merge. They agreed to merge in 2000 before a rival bid for the LSE from Sweden\u2019s OM Gruppen scuppered the deal, which was then rejected anyway. The LSE then rejected a formal \u00a31.3bn offer from Deutsche B\u00f6rse in January 2005. Deutsche B\u00f6rse and LSE said the \u20ac450m of cuts would equal 20% of their combined operating costs and would take three years to achieve. They said detailed plans had not been drawn and that the impact on employees could not be calculated yet. There will also be revenue gains from selling more services to customers and European companies will benefit from greater access to capital funding, they said. John Colley, a professor at Warwick Business School, said the planned cost cuts appeared meagre and left room for a rival bidder to offer more to LSE shareholders. \u201c\u2019Mergers of equals\u2019 usually result in a lack of clarity in direction and leadership as both camps jockey for influence. A result is a confused structure and a failure to drive cost savings opportunities arising from the merger. \u201cThe most likely intervention will come from the US network of exchanges and clearing houses, Intercontinental Exchange, led by founder and president Jeffrey Sprecher. The current approach of the LSE and Deutsche B\u00f6rse may not be aggressive enough to see off Sprecher\u2019s unwanted attention.\u201d Under UK takeover rules, Deutsche B\u00f6rse cannot ask LSE for a break fee if the deal fails, leaving greater room for a rival offer. Fees are sometimes payable by a company if it withdraws a bid but the merger structure of the deal means no such \u201creverse break fee\u201d is possible. The deal is going forward under the shadow of the British referendum on EU membership on 23 June. Kengeter said a vote for Britain to leave the union could affect some transaction volumes but that \u201cthe overall proposition is not endangered at all\u201d. Xavier Rolet, LSE\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThis is not conditional on the outcome of the referendum. We simply do not know [and] we will simply have to take a look. No one knows, if the outcome was an exit, what the consequences would be.\u201d The Frankfurt-based exchange will buy LSE through a new company called UK TopCo, which will pay tax in the UK but will be listed in London and Frankfurt. Deutsche B\u00f6rse and LSE will be subsidiaries of the new company, which will combine LSE\u2019s share trading operations with Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s strong derivatives dealing business. With concerns in the UK and Germany about their national exchange being subsumed by that of the other country, Kengeter said bosses had not yet decided on what the new company would be called. \u201cUnfortunately, no, we don\u2019t have a name yet. We will take it step by step. We need a name of course before completion but that is going to take a while so it\u2019s still early days.\u201d The LSE chairman, Donald Brydon, will chair the board and Kengeter will have the same job after the takeover. Rolet will step down but he will work as an adviser to the chairman and deputy chairman, Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s Joachim Faber, for up to a year. Brydon said the board had not decided how much Rolet, who was paid \u00a36.4m for 2014, would receive as a pay-off or for his advisory role.",

The energy boss received a \u00a3580,000 bonus and a \u00a3600,000 \u201crecruitment award\u201d as well as a basic salary of \u00a3925,000. The figures, published in the company\u2019s annual report, triggered immediate anger from fuel poverty campaigners who noted that energy suppliers had just been rapped over the knuckles by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for overcharging. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that one man can pocket so much, whilst so many people are counting pennies trying keep their meter topped up through the winter. British Gas are ruthless in pursuing customers in debt, trying to get blood out of a stone,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the Fuel Poverty Action group. \u201cYet the recent [CMA] report confirms that they and the other five big energy companies have been creaming off \u00a31.7bn a year and rising \u2013 \u00a32.5bn last year \u2013 in extra profits from their loyal customers,\u201d she added.

Centrica\u2019s adjusted operating profits fell 12% to \u00a31.5bn, but the British Gas residential supply earnings rose by over 30% to \u00a3574m. The Centrica remuneration committee justified the executive payments to Conn in the annual report. \u201cAlthough group adjusted operating profit decreased compared with the previous year, this was against a challenging environment with further falls in wholesale gas and power prices during the year. Weak performance in British Gas business and direct energy services was offset by good results elsewhere in the group,\u201d it said in a statement. Elsewhere, the remuneration committee praised Conn for his new programme to make the group more efficient, but there is no mention of the 4,000 net loss in jobs planned for Centrica, 10% of the total workforce. The total number of redundancies is 6,000, though the group hopes to create 2,000 new posts. The CMA unveiled a series of measures last week to try to introduce more competition into the energy markets. It accused the industry of overcharging UK energy consumers to the tune of \u00a31.7bn annually. Critics noted that the Centrica report had been put out just hours ahead of the budget announcement, which will dominate headlines on Wednesday.",

    "webTitle": "UK unemployment at 10-year low as wage growth edges up", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK unemployment has held at a 10-year low and wage growth has edged up, according to official figures that provide a small, pre-budget boost for George Osborne. Average weekly earnings for employees rose 2.1% in the three months to January compared with a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. That was faster than the 2% growth rate in the previous three months. It also beat economists\u2019 forecasts for another 2% reading in a Reuters poll. The unemployment rate was 5.1%, compared with 5.7% a year earlier. But pay growth is still below pre-crisis levels and has remained sluggish despite other signs of improvement in the UK labour market, where employment is at a record high of 31.4 million. Economists and the ONS cautioned that this latest improvement in wage growth was only modest. Nick Palmer, an ONS statistician, said: \u201cOnce again the latest quarterly figures show continuing high employment levels but no significant pick-up in earnings growth.\u201d The Bank of England has floated several possible explanations for low pay growth, including: the number of hours worked per person per week may have started to decline; employment growth has been skewed towards lower paid jobs; or that the low level of headline inflation may be leading to less generous pay rises. Slow wage growth has hit income tax receipts for the exchequer and knocked the Treasury\u2019s deficit-reduction plans off course this year. Against the backdrop of shaky global economy, the chancellor is expected to announce fresh spending cuts in Wednesday\u2019s budget to keep to his target to get public finances in surplus by the end of the decade. Pay growth is still well above inflation, which has hovered close to zero for the past year. This means pay is rising for workers in real terms, providing a welcome boost after years of sub-inflation pay growth after the financial crisis. With inflation so low, however, the absence of any significant recovery in pay growth pointed to \u201ca worrying long-term trend of weaker pay settlements\u201d, said Laura Gardiner at the Resolution Foundation thinktank. She added: \u201cWeak earnings growth, coupled with the ratcheting up of the personal tax allowance, are lowering tax receipts and putting more pressure on the public finances. \u201cSecuring stronger pay growth through productivity enhancing policy measures will be a key test of today\u2019s budget if it is to have a significant legacy on the labour market.\u201d The TUC generalsecretary Frances O\u2019Grady echoed calls for more focus on closing Britain\u2019s stubbornly wide productivity gap, which has left it lagging behind other big economies. O\u2019Grady said: \u201cDespite continued jobs growth, a full recovery in the value of wages is still years away. Average weekly earnings are still worth \u00a340 a week less than before the crash and pay growth remains too slow.\u201d But Ian Stewart, the chief economist at Deloitte, said the labour market figures were generally helpful to the chancellor as he prepares to give his eighth budget. \u201cA better than expected drop in unemployment hands the chancellor some much needed good news on budget day,\u201d said Stewart. He added: \u201cDespite global growth fears, the jobs market remains a standout success for the UK with record employment rates and more people in work than ever, even with a shrinking public sector.\u201d Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, was also optimistic that wage growth may start rising again, boosted by the National Living Wage that Osborne announced last summer. The new minimum pay level for over-25s takes effect in April. Clarke said: \u201cIt seems that the soft patch for wages late last year was a blip and the recent run of better data is the new norm. Maybe it is an early feeding in of the National Living Wage.\u201d The Bank of England is unlikely to be worried by the small pick-up in wage growth. The latest figures also do little to change expectations that interest rates will stay at their record low of 0.5% throughout this year, said Howard Archer, an economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight. Even taking January pay growth alone, as opposed to the ONS\u2019 preferred three-month measure, there appeared to be little pressure from wages of overall inflation in the economy. Archer said: \u201cEarnings growth at 2.5% in January itself remains below the level (at least 3.0%) that the Bank of England believes is consistently needed to get consumer price inflation up towards its 2.0% target level,. \u201cEarnings growth is also still at a muted level that is below what the chancellor needs to meet his tax receipt targets.\u201d The latest labour market data also included an update on public sector employment and underscored the effects of government spending cuts. Total UK public sector employment was 5.35 million in December. That was 3,000 higher than September 2015 but 50,000 lower than December 2014. Employment in UK local government, at 2.23 million, was 15,000 lower than September 2015 and the lowest since records began in 1999. Employment in UK central government, at 2.95 million, was 26,000 higher than in September 2015.",

      "bodyText": "Ahead of a number of key events - including the UK budget and the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision - markets are edging higher once more. An exception is Hikma Pharmaceuticals, down 97p or nearly 6% to \u00a316.24 after the group reported in-line 2015 results but forecast lower than expected revenues for the current year. The company, which recently bought US business Roxane, said revenues slipped 3% to $1.44bn last year and operating profits were down 4% at $409m. But a forecast of revenues of $2bn to $2.1bn in 2016 was shy of expectations. Analysts kept their buy recommendations, however. Stifel said: Hikma has announced a strong end to 2015. Whilst sales of $1.44bn... were in line with expectations, adjusted earnings per share of $1.44 (Stifel estimate $1.27), were well ahead of consensus. Guidance for 2016 is for sales of $2.0-$2.1bn, slightly below our forecasts, and margin guidance in the generics business, which now includes Roxane, of low double-digits is significantly below our estimates. We continue to believe the long-term benefits of the Roxane acquisition will drive strong earnings growth beyond 2016 and we reiterate our buy rating. Meanwhile Jefferies said: Hikma\u2019s 2015 was ahead of the market but 2016 guidance is light versus Jefferies estimates and consensus,in particular for US generics but also injectables. Other pharmaceutical groups were also weaker, with Shire down 158p at \u00a336.09, GlaxoSmithKline 21.5p lower at 1394.5p and AstraZeneca slipping 51.5p to 3970.5p. Overall though the FTSE 100 has added 18.47 points to 6158.44, with commodity companies among the risers as oil edged up again and metal prices were lifted by hopes of further Chinese stimulus measures to boost its economy. Investors remain cautious however ahead of the budget, and the Fed meeting, even though no rate change is expected at the moment. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: There should be few headline surprises from Chancellor George Osborne whose hands are largely tied by the uncertainty over whether the UK will still be part of the European Union by the end of June. So, it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll announce anything that is likely to lose votes or place the UK in dire straits should the country vote to leave the union. Focus again will fall on the need to cut public spending. Most of the main policies are already known, but some expect him to punish drivers by raising fuel duty, and there could be tax breaks for middle to higher income earners. There should be few surprises in the US too with many expecting the Fed to hold off until June at least before raising interest rates again. Investors instead will study comments on growth and inflation for clues as to when the next rate rise may occur. BP is 7p better at 349p as Brent crude added 1.47% to $39.31 a barrel, while among the mining companies, Anglo American is up 6.65p at 494.1p and Fresnillo is 16p better at 931p. Tui has fallen 53.5p to 992.5p and Thomas Cook is down 6.35p to 95.25p as Citigroup cut both tour operators from hold to sell. Citi pointed to weaker UK demand as well as cost pressure from tighter demand from hotels.",
