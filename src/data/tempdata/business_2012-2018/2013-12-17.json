      "bodyText": "The Bank of England will announce plans on Wednesday to press ahead with switching to plastic banknotes, starting with the new Sir Winston Churchill \u00a35 note in 2016. The decision on polymer notes will mark the beginning of the end for 320 years of paper notes from the Bank. The move by Threadneedle Street follows Bank governor Mark Carney's native Canada, where plastic notes are being rolled out, and Australia, where they have been in circulation for more than two decades. Carney launched a public consultation on polymer banknotes, seen as cleaner and more durable, shortly after arriving at the Bank this summer. However, the Bank's notes division has been considering plastic money for several years. Bank officials have been touring shopping centres and business groups around the country with prototype notes to canvas public opinion and the final decision is due todayon Wednesday. The Bank has promoted its polymer notes, featuring a see-through window and other new security features as less threadbare and tougher to counterfeit. It has sought to quell concerns about the environmental impact of printing on plastic by suggesting they can last up to six times longer than the cotton-paper notes in circulation at the moment. The durability will also compensate for the higher production costs and save an estimated \u00a3100m, the Bank claims. Its laboratory tests showed polymer banknotes only begin to shrink and melt at 120C, so they would fare better in washing machines but could be damaged by a hot iron. The initial plan is to introduce polymer notes one denomination at a time, with the Churchill note in 2016 at the earliest and then the \u00a310 note featuring Jane Austen next in 2017. The notes will continue to feature the Queen and retain their current colouring. The move is the latest in a long line of changes for banknotes, first issued in return for deposits by the Bank when it was first established in 1694 to raise money for William III's war against France. Colour \u00a35 notes replaced white ones in the 1950s; the first portrayal of a monarch came in 1960, when the Queen appeared on a new \u00a31 note; and the introduction of historical figures such as William Shakespeare started in the 1970s. As part of the preparation for this latest change, banknote officials have already been working with retailers and the operators of vending machines and cashpoints. Link, which runs the UK cash machine network, said its machines would need new cassettes to hold the plastic notes, because they will be smaller, and not because of the change in material. The 15% reduction in size for Churchill notes compared with the current Elizabeth Fry \u00a35 note brings English notes into line with sizes in other countries. But they will remain larger than existing euro notes and the different denominations of sterling will retain tiered sizes to help blind people differentiate between them. The prospect of polymer notes has raised some concerns for the visually impaired, however, as the popular practice of folding or creasing notes in different ways to identify different denominations will no longer be possible. Polymer notes can be folded but will not stay tightly folded in a particular way. The Bank's prime task as banknote issuer is to maintain confidence in its money, and the move to polymer is expected to make life drastically more difficult for counterfeiters. Advances in commercially available laser and inkjet printers over the past decade have helped criminals to produce fakes quickly and more cheaply. The Bank concedes no note is counterfeit-proof but says the polymer notes will be slower and more expensive to copy. The notes will be produced at the Bank's ultra-secure plant in Debden, Essex, by a private contractor. The job is expected to go to either De La Rue, the existing maker of BoE notes, or Innovia, which manufactures most of the polymer notes currently in circulation around the world. The Bank has ruled out importing plastic money from China. The British Plastics Federation welcomed the Bank's move towards polymer notes. \"It's essential all the plastic banknotes are made in the UK. Why not make coins out of plastic? It will save wear and tear on our pockets,\" said director-general Peter Davis.",

      "bodyText": "The small but pretty church hall in the Buckinghamshire village of Waddesdon is bedecked with holly, a forest of Christmas trees and piles of presents big enough to suit a giant. It could be a jolly night for the local rotary were it not for the full camera crew, studio lighting bright enough to blind a reindeer and an equally dazzling line-up of celebrities. But this event won't be a TV Christmas special on BBC1 or Channel 4. Presenter Phillip Schofield along with celebrity chefs Heston Blumenthal, Rachel Allen and Tom and Henry Herbert, better known as the Fabulous Baker Brothers, are here to film a live special for Waitrose, streamed via YouTube and the retailer's website. Behind the audience, partly made up of local shoppers, award winners and influential food bloggers, are Waitrose staff, crammed into a small cupboard at the back of the hall ready to answer customer online queries prompted by the show. The expensive-looking event is the upscale supermarket's latest sally in the battle to win social media fans as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube play an increasingly important role in winning shoppers. This year, advertising on social media has grown nearly threefold in Britain to \u00a3242.5m, according to figures from the Internet Advertising Bureau. Rupert Ellwood, head of marketing at Waitrose, says: \"We see social media as a way of opening the brand up to new people who might not necessarily engage with us in other ways. They are potentially younger people who have a different lifestyle.\" People who engage with brands via social media spend between 20% and 40% more with the brand than other customers, according to global consultancy Bain &amp; Company. Of course, that number is partly self-fulfilling, because shoppers who like and use a brand are the most likely to \"like\" it on Facebook, follow it on Twitter or collect images of its products on Pinterest. Such is the power of the internet that the likes of Marks &amp; Spencer and Argos, as well as Waitrose, have kept shoppers interested in their Christmas ads using social media competitions. John Lewis kicked off its festive campaign by creating a small forest on London's South Bank and an unbranded trailer on ITV to help publicise its Twitter hashtag #sleepingbear before the launch of its \u00a31m Disney-style ad. It has racked up a heady 10m views online, more than 10 times the number of its nearest competitors. Meanwhile, Sainsbury's this week said it was ditching celebrity chefs in favour of food bloggers including Jack Monroe, writer of A Girl Called Jack. Ellwood admits: \"In future bloggers could become as influential in food as they are in the fashion industry and to a degree they already are. We wouldn't want to do a joined-up social media campaign without engaging bloggers.\" But he believes there is also an opportunity to attract shoppers with the kind of programme they cannot find on mainstream media. \"Apart from programmes like the Great British Bake Off there is not a huge number of quality food programmes on TV. We have a massive line-up of talent that wants to engage with us and it gives us the opportunity to give something to customers that is unique and a step ahead,\" said Ellwood. David Moth of digital marketing hub Econsultancy says it reflects a growing trend for brands to create their own events, experiences and editorial content to attract attention online. Whether it's Red Bull backing a parachute jump from the edge of space or Topshop livestreaming its fashion shows or ASOS publishing a fashion mag, they are looking at ways to move beyond advertising to interact more \"naturally\" in social media spaces. \"People have realised that buying ads on Facebook or Twitter can only get you so far,\" he said. Ellwoodsays Waitrose isn't just trying to encourage people to click on a link to its website and buy something but to build loyalty and understanding of the brand. \"We are looking for long-term relationships,\" he said. \"Anybody more engaged with the brand is likely to spend more.\" Meanwhile, with 65% of Waitrose shoppers expected to have a smartphone by next year, the supermarket would be foolish to ignore social media. Research suggests that mobile users are more likely to use social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to guide them around the internet than search engines such as Google. More than a third of the UK population visits Facebook every day, with 83% of those users \u2013 some 20m people \u2013 using a smartphone or tablet to check their updates. That's typically double the audience of a TV show such as The X Factor, which retailers spend thousands of pounds to advertise with.",

    "webTitle": "Plastic banknotes: the implications for security, dealers and magicians", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England will follow in the footsteps of Canada, Australia and Hong Kong today when it announces the move to plastic banknotes starting in 2016. Bank officials have been on a shopping centre roadshow testing the prototype polymer notes among members of the public and looking for approval of money they say is cleaner, longer lasting and harder to counterfeit. A final decision due today is widely expected to be in favour of polymer. The introduction of plastic notes will have widespread implications. The crime fighter \"It is an excellent move and most forward-thinking banks around the world are doing the same,\" says John Sheridan, who leads on counterfeit currency at the National Crime Agency. While no banknote is ever completely counterfeit proof, introducing polymer will make things much harder and more expensive for fakers. Firstly, where criminals have counterfeited polymer notes around the world so far they have had to produce a substitute material as they cannot get their hands on the real polymer substrate, says Sheridan. If they do manage to replicate the material, printing on plastic brings big challenges. \"People who produce counterfeit notes using commercially available equipment such as inkjet printers will find it extremely difficult to get the inks and toners to apply to the polymer substrate. They will find it even more difficult to apply the security features such as the metallic strip\". Polymer also allows banknote issuers to bring in new security features, such as transparent windows. The Bank of England is not the only institution issuing banknotes in the UK, seven commercial banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland (S&amp;NI) are also authorised to do so. Sheridan is hoping polymer will be adopted there too. \"If everyone went across to polymer it would be happy days from the NCA's perspective,\" he says. The cash machine operator Cash machines are largely unaffected by the polymer notes but the cassettes that hold five pound notes will have to be changed, says Graham Mott at LINK, which operates the UK cash machine network. \"That is less to do with the fact it's polymer than the size change,\" says Mott of the new smaller fivers. Because a cash machine can hold a maximum of four cassettes, once a machine is converted to new five pound notes, it will probably only dispense the new plastic versions. Engineers may also have to tweak settings so machines can check the new security features in polymer notes. \"We are not anticipating a wholesale change to cash machines... it's going to be a big job of coordination,\" says Mott. At least the BoE's decision go plastic with five pound notes first means an easy start - out of around 67,000 cash machines in the UK only 5,500 dispense \u00a35 notes. The banknotes dealer Barry Boswell has been dealing in paper money since 1986 and sells to collectors from his website, TheBanknoteStore.com. The hobby has been growing worldwide with many thousands of collectors in the UK and perhaps as many as 2 million in China, he says. But Bank of England banknotes from the second world war onwards are not scarce at all and new polymer notes will make few waves, says Boswell. \"They will not affect the collector market at all other than it gives collectors another item to tuck away into their albums,\" says the Daventry-based dealer. Britons have a tendency to squirrel away money at the back of wardrobes and Boswell is often contacted by people who find stashes. If it is post-war notes he tells them they would be better off exchanging them for new at a bank. When the old five pond notes are phased out, he expects the same lack of rarity value. \"It will be 50 years at least until this affects the market,\" he says. The banknote printer Tha BoE has already said that polymer notes will be printed at its print works in Debden, Essex, but it is not yet decided which company will have the printing contract. At the moment De La Rue produces all Bank of England notes but its current contract expires in March 2015. If it does get the next contract, including producing polymer notes from 2016, it has plastic money experience to build on. De La Rue developed its first polymer banknote in the late 1970s. Earlier this year it launched its own polymer substrate, Safeguard and Fiji issued notes on the material in April. The magician The prospect of tougher, polymer banknotes has been a hot topic within the Magic Circle, says member Will Houstoun. \"There are some magic tricks that won't be possible with the new notes and vice versa there will be new opportunities and possibilities that the new notes will open up,\" he says. The trick of tearing up a note and restoring it to a whole is out, says Houstoun, who is writing a PhD on the history of magic. But for another classic illusion polymer brings advances: The trick of taking someone's money, marking it and making it reappear in a piece of fruit. That started in Victorian times with a half crown marked with a knife, then as banknotes became more popular they were taken, signed and returned via the fruit. \"If you do that using a paper banknote when you give it back it's sodden through with lemon juice. With polymer you could wipe the note clean for the person to put back in their pocket,\" says Houstoun.",

      "body": "<p>The Bank of England will follow in the footsteps of Canada, Australia and Hong Kong today when it announces the move to plastic banknotes starting in 2016.</p> <p>Bank officials have been on a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/16/bank-of-england-polymer-notes-shoppers\" title=\"\">shopping centre roadshow</a> testing the prototype polymer notes among members of the public and looking for approval of money they say is <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/polymer/Pages/faq.aspx\" title=\"\">cleaner, longer lasting and harder to counterfeit</a>. A final decision due today is widely expected to be in favour of polymer. The introduction of plastic notes will have widespread implications.</p> <p><strong>The crime fighter</strong></p> <p>\"It is an excellent move and most forward-thinking banks around the world are doing the same,\" says John Sheridan, who leads on counterfeit currency at the <a href=\"http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">National Crime Agency</a>. While no banknote is ever completely counterfeit proof, introducing polymer will make things much harder and more expensive for fakers. Firstly, where criminals have counterfeited polymer notes around the world so far they have had to produce a substitute material as they cannot get their hands on the real polymer substrate, says Sheridan. If they do manage to replicate the material, printing on plastic brings big challenges. \"People who produce counterfeit notes using commercially available equipment such as inkjet printers will find it extremely difficult to get the inks and toners to apply to the polymer substrate. They will find it even more difficult to apply the security features such as the metallic strip\".</p> <p>Polymer also allows banknote issuers to bring in new security features, such as transparent windows. The Bank of England is not the only institution issuing banknotes in the UK, seven commercial banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland (S&amp;NI) are also authorised to do so. Sheridan is hoping polymer will be adopted there too. \"If everyone went across to polymer it would be happy days from the NCA's perspective,\" he says.</p> <p><strong>The cash machine operator</strong></p> <p>Cash machines are largely unaffected by the polymer notes but the cassettes that hold five pound notes will have to be changed, says Graham Mott at <a href=\"http://www.link.co.uk/Pages/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">LINK</a>, which operates the UK cash machine network. \"That is less to do with the fact it's polymer than the size change,\" says Mott of the new smaller fivers. Because a cash machine can hold a maximum of four cassettes, once a machine is converted to new five pound notes, it will probably only dispense the new plastic versions. Engineers may also have to tweak settings so machines can check the new security features in polymer notes. \"We are not anticipating a wholesale change to cash machines... it's going to be a big job of coordination,\" says Mott. At least the BoE's decision go plastic with five pound notes first means an easy start - out of around 67,000 cash machines in the UK only 5,500 dispense \u00a35 notes.</p> <p><strong>The banknotes dealer</strong></p> <p>Barry Boswell has been dealing in paper money since 1986 and sells to collectors from his website, <a href=\"http://www.thebanknotestore.com/index.html\" title=\"\">TheBanknoteStore.com</a>. The hobby has been growing worldwide with many thousands of collectors in the UK and perhaps as many as 2 million in China, he says. But Bank of England banknotes from the second world war onwards are not scarce at all and new polymer notes will make few waves, says Boswell.</p> <p>\"They will not affect the collector market at all other than it gives collectors another item to tuck away into their albums,\" says the Daventry-based dealer. Britons have a tendency to squirrel away money at the back of wardrobes and Boswell is often contacted by people who find stashes. If it is post-war notes he tells them they would be better off exchanging them for new at a bank.

Either way, the chairman of the airports commission is clearly deeply sceptical on fundamental grounds like expense (up to \u00a3112bn, his report said), environmental damage, legal risks and the shift in the economic gravity of the UK. Damning with faint praise, Davies called the estuary idea of Johnson \"imaginative\". It will be studied \"in case\" it is a serious option. He doesn't sound keen. For practical purposes, then, it looks like a shoot-out between Heathrow and Gatwick in the eyes of the commission. The view here remains the same: if we're in the business of fudge and making use of existing infrastructure, the next new runway should be built at Gatwick. The case for Heathrow, as with the Isle of Grain proposal, rests on the idea that the south-east needs a single hub airport to make frequent flights to Hyderabad, Hanoi, deepest China, etcetera, economically viable. There is clearly some force in that analysis, even if Heathrow's owners have been hamming up their argument by claiming there are 26 emerging markets destinations served daily by other European hubs but not by Heathrow. The commission found that six of the 26 are services to second-tier airports in Poland and five are short-haul leisure destinations; all are served by services from other London airports. But the disadvantage of a single hub is that it comes to dominate everything. The Davies report sensibly notes that not everybody shares the flag carriers' obsession with hubs. Low-cost carriers, who rely on low-cost airports, are eating larger slices of the business travel market. Armed with new aircraft capable of flying point-to-point, they could make serious inroads into the transatlantic market. If that vision is credible, then expanding Heathrow seems likely to undermine competition and limit choice on many routes by pushing up fares. The audience of top-end business travellers, deprived of the odd flight to Seoul and Jakarta, may grumble. But it is perverse to force an ever greater number of polluting flights over west London if a lot of the traffic could be directed to Gatwick. The moratorium on expanding the Sussex airport expires in 2019 and the owners think they could have a new runway in operation in 2025. It is the option that imposes extra noise on the fewest people, which is surely the biggest argument in its favour. Heathrow would be free to continue to ply its trade as a premium hub airport catering for transit passengers. But Gatwick, with the help of improved connections to central London, would provide stiffer competition. Encouragingly, Davies has not swallowed the attempt by Heathrow to frame the debate as a \"hub or no hub\" argument. Gatwick is on the shortlist \u2013 and deserves to be there.",

If I may Chairman, I have a few brief opening remarks reviewing progress on the Bank\u2019s responsibilities over the past year. inflation has fallen back to within a hair\u2019s breadth of the 2% target and the recovery has finally taken hold. The news about the strength of the recovery in the United Kingdom has consistently surprised on the upside and by more than in either the United States or the Euro Area.</p> <p>It is welcome that the economy is growing again, but a return to growth is not yet a return to normality. Nearly one million more people are out of work than in the years before the financial crisis, and the economy remains 2.5% smaller than it was in 2008.</p> <p>The recovery has some way to run before it would be appropriate to consider adjusting the&#xa0;exceptional level of monetary stimulus that we continue to provide to the economy. In recognition of that, the Monetary Policy Committee introduced forward guidance in August, making clear that we will not even consider raising Bank Rate at least until the unemployment rate reaches 7%. That gives households and businesses the confidence that interest rates won\u2019t go up until jobs, incomes and spending are recovering at a sustainable pace.</p> <p>The effect of forward guidance is evident in financial markets. Shorter-term interest rate expectations have not reacted as strongly as they have in the past to the sharp bounce back in expected activity and measures of market interest rate volatility have fallen notably .</p> <p>More importantly, forward guidance is having an effect in the real economy. My experience, having met with more than 300 businesses around the country, is that business people understand forward guidance well. This is confirmed by the reports of our network of Agents across the nation. What matters most for households and businesses is not market expectations of interest rates, but what actually happens to Bank Rate now and in the future. That is because&#xa0;the interest rates on 70% of mortgage loans to households and more than 50% of loans to&#xa0;businesses are linked to Bank Rate.&#xa0;</p> <p>Our forward guidance framework builds in safeguards against the risks to inflation and&#xa0;financial stability that arise from an extended period of stimulus. In the event, inflation pressures are well contained at present, although we are monitoring inflation expectations closely. We are equally alive to the risk that extended stimulus could promote financial instability. With the adoption of forward guidance, we have made it clear that monetary policy is the last line of defence against such risks, with the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) taking the leading role.</p> <p>In its most recent Financial Stability Report the FPC paid particular attention to the risks posed&#xa0;by the recovery in the UK housing market. These risks are manageable and are being managed. By acting in a graduated and proportionate way, we are reducing the likelihood that larger interventions will be needed later, and we are allowing the broader economy to continue to receive the stimulus it needs, for as long as its needs, to sustain the recovery.</p> <p>Securing financial stability requires much more than a resilient housing market. The FPC and the PRA have acted to ensure that our major banks are adequately capitalised for expected future losses, a more conservative assessment of their asset risk weights, and future costs of redress for past misconduct. In total, UK banks\u2019 equity has increased by \u00a3140bn in the past 6 years and risk-weighted capital ratios have doubled.</p> <p>The Bank remains at the forefront of the international effort to solve the problem of financial institutions that are too big to fail. Next year, the Financial Stability Board will be establishing standards on the amount, type and location of gone concern loss absorbing capacity that banks should hold to ensure they are resolvable in a crisis without taxpayer support. Alongside our international partners, the Bank is working to establish practical resolution plans for the major UK banks.</p> <p>The Bank is also working towards creating more robust financial markets. An important part of that is catalysing more efficient and effective collateral management by backstopping private markets. Accordingly we have revised our sterling monetary framework to offer money and collateral for longer terms against a wider range of assets, to a wider range of participants, at more competitive costs.</p> <p>The year has also seen the conclusion of the impressive work of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards and the Banking Reform Bill, which benefitted from the wisdom of&#xa0;many here. The Bank will now take forward implementation of many of the Bill\u2019s measures, including ring-fencing of retail banking activities and the new Senior Persons Regime. As these reforms are given life, they should accelerate the rehabilitation of the financial sector so that it once again merits trust and is focussed on serving the needs of the real economy.</p> <p>Chairman, those are the headlines from a very busy year at the Bank. I appreciate that the Committee may want to examine some of these issues, and the challenges for the coming year, in more detail and I look forward to your questions.</p> <p>[end]</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-17T17:59:32.507Z\">at 5.59pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52b074abe4b008af53c5c7f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-17T15:59:38.034Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Bank is aware of the risk that an extended period of loose monetary policy would have on financial stability, says Mark Carney.</p> <p>We're watching carefully, and&#xa0;we will act when needed.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52b07439e4b0a4c35bcc02f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-17T15:58:29.092Z\">3.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But the recovery has some way to run before it would be appropriate to tighten monetary policy, says Carney - pointing out that the UK economy is still 2.5% below its pre-crisis peak.</p> <p>He cites the Bank's forward guidance (<em>his first big idea as governor</em>) - that bank rate won't rise until the economy is much stronger (with the jobless rate falling to 7%).</p> <p><strong>Forward guidance is having an effect in the real economy, he says.

Low crop yields caused by poor weather conditions in 2012 had pushed up the prices of some fresh produce in November last year, but this effect has since fallen out.</p> <p>A second key factor easing pressure on the headline rate was the cost of home utilities. Annual price inflation on electricity and gas fell to 6.7% and 6.3% respectively, each down roughly two percentage points from October to reach their lowest rates since early 2013. This is the result of the timings of tariff hikes \u2013 none of the recently announced price increases had taken place by November, whereas the cost of home utilities started to push up CPI in the same month last year.</p> <p>This further improvement of the inflationary environment will help to reduce the squeeze on UK household spending power, a factor that is likely to help support consumer confidence. A robust expansion of the UK economy is expected for Q4 2013, boosted in part by consumer spending.</p> <p>However, despite today\u2019s good news for UK households, the gap between inflation and wage growth remains substantial.

      "bodyText": "As the Bank of England's carol service gets into full swing, let's round up the key points. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has told the House of Lords that Britain's economy is recovering, but warned that the weak state of the eurozone could hold it back. In his first appearance at the Lords' Economics Committee, Carney said that the recovery had \"finally taken hold\", but it's too early to consider tightening monetary policy (here's his opening statement). He cited the eurozone as a key 'headwind', saying: The headwind from very weak demand - likely very weak demand for some time - from our major trading partner Europe.... could [help] reduce the potential growth of this economy for some time. This is less likely to be a robust, sustained recovery. In a sometimes technical session, overshadowed by the risk of Dr Carney missing his first star turn at the Bank's own carol service, the governor said that \"barring shocks\", the Bank would not extend its quantitative easing bond-buying programme. He also surprised some on the committee by explaining that the Bank would look to raise interest rates (at the appropriate time) before starting to unwind QE. Once again, the governor found himself defending his forward guidance pledge not to consider raising rates before the jobless total has dropped from 7.6% to 7%. He also argued that the UK economy was not gripped by secular stagnation-- suggesting that the country is climbing out of a liquidity trap. Carney agreed that more work needs to be done to end the problems of banks who are too big to fail. And he declined to give his views on Scottish independence, but promised to provide the Bank's dry, technical analysis on an independent Scotland keeping the pound before next year's referendum. Other key points today: UK inflation has fallen to a four-year low....but new energy price rises could undermine it. The government said the news showed its plans are working.... while Labour warned that the cost of living crisis continues. Britain's house prices have risen 5.5% in the last year to new record highs..... but not if you adjust for inflation. And a quarter of the nation's mortgage debt is held by Londoners. European car sales have risen for the third month in a row, offering hopes of recovery in the auto sector. Greece has got permission for its next aid tranche....hours after its central bank predicted a shallower contraction this year ...but eurozone finance ministers face tough negotiations in coming days over the nitty-gritty of banking union. Back tomorrow. Thanks and goodnight. GW A few more photos of the Lords economic committee putting Mark Carney through his paces: A couple of quick final questions, including one about whether we can trust the results reported by Britain's banks. Carney believes the results are accurate, but agrees that it would be good to get 'enhanced' results with more details. And then the House of Lords economics committee release the governor to the delights of his carol service (it's the Bank of England's festive bash, no less). He's got under half an hour to get there for his reading -- and was out of his seat with impressive speed: Mark Carney gets the Scottish question -- when will he make the Bank of England's position on Scottish independence clear, following the White Paper that proposes that an independent Scotland would keep the pound? Carney replies that it's important to distinguish between political issues and economic ones. We will provide some \"dry\", technical analysis on the economic issues in some time, he promises. Scottish independence would have consequences ono \"monetary arrangements\", he continues, citing the mobility of labour and capital goods. But he's trying hard not to answer the question -- and even cites his impending Carol Service appearance in his defence. Not enough time to go into the details, unfortunately. The committee sounds disappointed, saying this is a very important issue -- can you have monetary union without political union? Carney isn't tempted to respond. But will the Bank give its views in detail in the run-up to next year's referendum on independence? Yes, says Carney. Lord Lawson asks Carney's views on leverage ratios. Would he set a higher level than the 3% ratio recommended by the Basel III rules, if he felt Britain needed it? Carney says he would, and adds that he hopes to set the leverage ratio for UK banks by the end of 2014. And he agrees that Canada has a leverage ratio of above 3%. The House of Lords economic committee has moved onto plans to \"ringfence\" investment bank operations from retail banking. Could banks decide that it's not worth the effort and break themselves up, asks Lord Lawson. Carney agrees that the ring fence plans does move the industry towards the issue of whether various financial operations work better within a holding company, or as fully independent businesses. That's not a decision for him, though. Sounds like there's a systemic risk to Mark Carney's appearance at tonight's carol service. The chairman asks how much longer he can stay. I read at 6.10pm, the governor replies. And it's a 20 minute journey -- I'm going to miss the first bit. I guess the wise men don't show up until late in the Nativity...... Lord May of Oxford asks Mark Carney whether it's ever possible to make a systemically important bank 'safe to fail'? You're right, says Carney -- if a bank is systemically important then it's still too big to fail. So we need to continue reforming the sector. We need credible resolution models, with capital distributed across parent companies and this subsidiaries. I don't think we should stop calling firm's 'systemically important' until they really aren't, the governor adds (changing the name doesn't fix the problem). And Carney also pointed to the Bank's work on strengthening the financial markets that seized up in 2008. Could the Bank use monetary policy to target house prices rather than the headline rate of inflation? Carney replies that the MPC is committed to its goal of keeping Consumer Prices Index close to 2%. It's the FPC's job to monitor whether house prices are threatening stability. He says it's important to watch the banks to ensure they are using the right mortgage underwriting standards and capital requirements to stop a housing bubble. Otherwise, problems arise if banks think prices will keep going up and up and up.... Reminder: Carney's appearance at the House of Lords economics committee is being streamed live. Mark Carney reassures the committee that he's in no rush to leave, but he does have to perform a \"reading at a carol service\" later. The life of a central banker is never dull . Lord Lawson (former chancellor in the Thatcher years) takes the opportunity to question Mark Carney. Did the governor really say that the Bank of England would raise interest rates before it started to sell some of the \u00a3375bn of UK sovereign debt it holds? Carney says that that's right -- it's better to start by adjusting conventional levers of monetary policy rather than the unconventional ones. Lawson is surprised -- as this hasn't been done before, is Carney really sure that a rate rise should come before unwinding QE? It's the prudent course, in my opinion, says Carney, given that there will continue to be demand for safe assets for some time. In other words, Britain's central bank is going to be holding a lot of UK government debt for a while... BANK OF ENGLAND'S CARNEY SAYS UNLIKELY THAT SIZE OF BOE BALANCE SHEET AS A SHARE OF GDP WILL FALL TO PRE-CRISIS SIZE DUE TO BANKS' INCREASED DEMAND FOR SAFE ASSETS When might the UK start to unwind QE? Carney modestly points out that he's only one member of the Monetary Policy Committee, so he doesn't get to decide on his own. Called up for giving a less than opaque answer, Carney jokes that: I didn\u2019t get to my position by being overly precise when I didn't need to be. But he then suggests that the Bank would \"tighten policy for some time before considering adjustments to our balance sheet\". Reminder: the Bank of England currently holds \u00a3375bn of government gilts. Was the governor consulted before George Osborne went to China and announced a deal to allow Chinese banks to open branches in the UK? Carney replies that the Prudential Regulation Authority had already taken a broad policy decision on foreign branches before the chancellor's visit. Do we risk a repeat of the Icelandic banking crash, in 2008? Carney points out that the deal with China refers to wholesale banking, not retail. Carney adds that the Bank doesn't know how much long-term damage has been done to the UK labour market by the crisis. The potential for the unemployment rate to fall is there - but it depends on growth and demand, as well as productivity, he adds. Lord Skidelsky (a expert on Keynes, among other things), points out that unemployment is a lagging economic indicator -- doesn't that undermine the idea of forward guidance? No, replies Carney. He points to the 'knockouts' (previous posts) which also peg the guidance to inflation expectations and the inflation rate. And the 7% jobless rate is a sensible target, he adds, partly because the long-term unemployment rate could be as high as 6.5%. So there's a good reason to keep rates at their record low of 0.5% until the headline rate has fallen significantly (it's currently 7.6%) Is Carney confident that he picked the right 'knockouts' for his forward guidance pledge to keep rates at current record lows? (these are the triggers that could force the Bank's hand even before the jobs market has recovered) The governor explains that it's important to have an \"inflation knockout\" as the cost of living has been running above the 2% target for some time. The 'financial stability' knockout is crucial, Carney adds (it lets the Financial Policy Committee step in if it thinks the Monetary Policy Committee is blundering) . That pledge relieves the MPC from worrying about implications on financial stability when trying to set the best level of monetary policy. A question about whether Britain's financial sector still makes up too large a share of the economy? Carney agrees that a significant portion of UK financial activity in the run-up to the crash was \"slicing and dicing\" existing financial products rather than productive allocation of capital to fund new projects. Britain's GDP as a share of global GDP will fall in coming years as emerging markets catch up, he adds. The City should still carry out its traditional role in the centre of the financial world - and could find more demand for more complex products as those emerging markets develop (I\"m paraphrasing the governor here) And the Bank of England is alive to the risks posed as the City develops in the years ahead. Great question -- what does Mark Carney think about Larry Summer's fear that the advanced economy has entered a period of secular stagnation? Carney begins by saying that it's always \"extremely dangerous\" to disagree with Larry Summers. He explains, though, that he isn't convinced by the idea that countries such as the US aren't capable of returning to their pre-crisis state without ongoing unconventional support. Britain has been trapped in a liquidity trap for some time, he says, but there are signs that it may be ending. The national rate of interest is becoming \"less negative\" , suggesting a return to normality. And barring further shocks, another programme of quantitative easing (buying bonds with newly created money) probably won't be needed in the UK, Carney suggests. I would suggest a degree of scepticism [of secular stagnation] as a driver of future prospects. PS: Summers has blogged about secular stagnation here Does the UK risk a repeat of Japan's lost decades? Carney argues that the situation is different this time -- policymakers have acted faster, and the global economy is weaker than when Japan's economic malaise (I think he's arguing that problems can't be left to fester). In the long term, Carney adds, provided that the \"institutional aspects\" of the economy are maintained, or ideally reinforced, there is no reason to think the economy won't return to its pre-crisis strength. Next question - does the governor believe the UK is actually going to experience a sustainable recovery in the medium term? Carney agrees that the recovery is being driven by consumers at present. There has not been a sharp upturn yet in business investment...productivity levels remain lacklustre, he says. The governor then adds that he expects to see a \"endogenous pick-up\" in productivity (which could include more part-time staff going full-time). But that won't be enough on its own. But the medium-term challenge facing all Central banks is \"how long is the hangover\" from the financial crisis. How long will it take to clean up the financial sector, and for households to rebalance? Those \"headwinds will persist for some time\" - and in the UK we also face another headwind, weak demand from our key market of Europe. Have you got the powers and tools you need? Mark Carney says the new Banking bill gives the BoE important new responsibilities - it now needs to carry them out (including by agreeing a global standard for leverage ratios*) The Senior Persons Regime (new controls on top bankers and the like) is an extremely important move, says Carney. * - last month, chancellor George Osborne asked the BoE to conduct a review of leverage ratios, suggesting that Britain's banks should not face tougher rules than the rest of the world. Carney also reckons that the new regulatory framework in the UK for the financial sector is working well. Carney says that his time as Canadian bank governor had taught him the importance of a 'true leverage ratio' (rules for how much high quality capital a commercial bank must hold). One of his first tasks in the UK was reaching agreements with some UK banks on their leverage ratio - the Canadian experience helped. First question -- how has your first six months as governor gone? Very different than that Bank of Canada? Carney says that his \"quite high\" standards of quality among Bank of England staff, for intellectual rigour and suchlike, has been met. And the strength of the UK recovery has \"pleasingly\" exceeded his expectations. The recovery has been stronger than the Bank expected, he says - although the Bank called the 'direction' of the recovery correctly, and closer than many independent economists (he adde). Excellent news - the Bank had uploaded Carney's opening statement. Here it is: Chairman, I am very grateful for the opportunity to give evidence to this Committee today. The sessions with Committees of both Houses are the cornerstone of the Bank of England\u2019s accountability to Parliament and, through Parliament, to the British people. At this time of year it is natural to take stock. If I may Chairman, I have a few brief opening remarks reviewing progress on the Bank\u2019s responsibilities over the past year. inflation has fallen back to within a hair\u2019s breadth of the 2% target and the recovery has finally taken hold. The news about the strength of the recovery in the United Kingdom has consistently surprised on the upside and by more than in either the United States or the Euro Area. It is welcome that the economy is growing again, but a return to growth is not yet a return to normality. Nearly one million more people are out of work than in the years before the financial crisis, and the economy remains 2.5% smaller than it was in 2008. The recovery has some way to run before it would be appropriate to consider adjusting the exceptional level of monetary stimulus that we continue to provide to the economy. In recognition of that, the Monetary Policy Committee introduced forward guidance in August, making clear that we will not even consider raising Bank Rate at least until the unemployment rate reaches 7%. That gives households and businesses the confidence that interest rates won\u2019t go up until jobs, incomes and spending are recovering at a sustainable pace. The effect of forward guidance is evident in financial markets. Shorter-term interest rate expectations have not reacted as strongly as they have in the past to the sharp bounce back in expected activity and measures of market interest rate volatility have fallen notably . More importantly, forward guidance is having an effect in the real economy. My experience, having met with more than 300 businesses around the country, is that business people understand forward guidance well. This is confirmed by the reports of our network of Agents across the nation. What matters most for households and businesses is not market expectations of interest rates, but what actually happens to Bank Rate now and in the future. That is because the interest rates on 70% of mortgage loans to households and more than 50% of loans to businesses are linked to Bank Rate. Our forward guidance framework builds in safeguards against the risks to inflation and financial stability that arise from an extended period of stimulus. In the event, inflation pressures are well contained at present, although we are monitoring inflation expectations closely. We are equally alive to the risk that extended stimulus could promote financial instability. With the adoption of forward guidance, we have made it clear that monetary policy is the last line of defence against such risks, with the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) taking the leading role. In its most recent Financial Stability Report the FPC paid particular attention to the risks posed by the recovery in the UK housing market. These risks are manageable and are being managed. By acting in a graduated and proportionate way, we are reducing the likelihood that larger interventions will be needed later, and we are allowing the broader economy to continue to receive the stimulus it needs, for as long as its needs, to sustain the recovery. Securing financial stability requires much more than a resilient housing market. The FPC and the PRA have acted to ensure that our major banks are adequately capitalised for expected future losses, a more conservative assessment of their asset risk weights, and future costs of redress for past misconduct. In total, UK banks\u2019 equity has increased by \u00a3140bn in the past 6 years and risk-weighted capital ratios have doubled. The Bank remains at the forefront of the international effort to solve the problem of financial institutions that are too big to fail. Next year, the Financial Stability Board will be establishing standards on the amount, type and location of gone concern loss absorbing capacity that banks should hold to ensure they are resolvable in a crisis without taxpayer support. Alongside our international partners, the Bank is working to establish practical resolution plans for the major UK banks. The Bank is also working towards creating more robust financial markets. An important part of that is catalysing more efficient and effective collateral management by backstopping private markets. Accordingly we have revised our sterling monetary framework to offer money and collateral for longer terms against a wider range of assets, to a wider range of participants, at more competitive costs. The year has also seen the conclusion of the impressive work of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards and the Banking Reform Bill, which benefitted from the wisdom of many here. The Bank will now take forward implementation of many of the Bill\u2019s measures, including ring-fencing of retail banking activities and the new Senior Persons Regime. As these reforms are given life, they should accelerate the rehabilitation of the financial sector so that it once again merits trust and is focussed on serving the needs of the real economy. Chairman, those are the headlines from a very busy year at the Bank. I appreciate that the Committee may want to examine some of these issues, and the challenges for the coming year, in more detail and I look forward to your questions. [end] The Bank is aware of the risk that an extended period of loose monetary policy would have on financial stability, says Mark Carney. We're watching carefully, and we will act when needed. But the recovery has some way to run before it would be appropriate to tighten monetary policy, says Carney - pointing out that the UK economy is still 2.5% below its pre-crisis peak. He cites the Bank's forward guidance (his first big idea as governor) - that bank rate won't rise until the economy is much stronger (with the jobless rate falling to 7%). Forward guidance is having an effect in the real economy, he says. Businesspeople and the public understand it. Mark Carney starts with a statement - saying that hearings at parliament are a cornerstone of the process of making central bankers responsible to the public. It's a good time to take stock, says Carney. Inflation is a \"hair's breath\" from the 2% target (as shown by this morning's data), and the recovery is underway. Slightly later than billed, Bank of England governor Mark Carney's hearing at the House of Lords economics committee is about to start - live feed here (sorry, I failed to embed the link first time).... I'll try to cover the key points in this blog.... Either the meeting is starting late or someone at parliament forgot to turn the web feed on.... While we wait for Mark Carney - there is an interesting article on The Conversation today which rebuts George Osborne's latest bright idea, a Whitehall CFO. It's by Colin Talbot, professor of government at University of Manchester. He explains that creating a new senior unelected position with the power to control government spending isn't terribly constitutional, and giving more power to the Treasury probably won't mean better government either. More here: The last thing Whitehall needs is a Chief Financial Officer Heads-up. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is about to appear before the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee to give his annual testimony. It will be streamed live here, from 3.35pm. Here's the issues which the committee plans to raise with the governor: What is his assessment of the UK\u2019s medium term economic prospects? Whether the realities of serving as Governor of the Bank of England have matched his expectations and what lessons he is applying that he learnt from his time as Governor of the Bank of Canada. How he expects his introduction of forward guidance on monetary policy (announcing that interest rates would not change while unemployment remains above 7%) to influence economic behaviour? Is there a risk that using unemployment as the signal to raise interest rates could be too late for effective control of inflation? Is there a conflict between the Bank\u2019s scrapping of the Funding for Lending scheme which supported mortgage lending and the expansion of the government\u2019s Help to Buy scheme? Would the Bank\u2019s financial stability objective be easier to meet if there was a full separation between retail and investment banking? Should bankers be subject to full professional standards in the same way as doctors and lawyers? What is his view on Scottish Government\u2019s aim set out in its White Paper to retain sterling as the currency of an independent Scotland? The Eurogroup of finance ministers has just confirmed that Greece has done enough to receive its next aid tranche, worth \u20ac1bn in total. In a statement, president Jeroen Dijsselbloem (who is also Dutch finance minister) said: I note with satisfaction that Greece has achieved the four milestones agreed with the Troika institutions in the context of the third review of its economic adjustment programme. Before adding: I am confident that the Greek authorities will swiftly conclude their discussions with the Troika institutions in order to allow for a completion of the ongoing review of the country\u2019s economic adjustment programme. And those milestones? First, Greece has placed over 12 500 public employees in the mobility scheme as part of the strategy to make the public administration more efficient. Second, Greece has taken adequate measures to significantly restructure or liquidate three state-owned companies which were intended for privatisation. Third, a Code of Lawyers was adopted to enhance the functioning of this regulated profession. Finally, Greece took the required steps to improve the financial situation of the two main water companies, by clearing government arrears, in order to facilitate their privatisation. But as our Helena Smith flagged up at 2.38pm, there are still several outstanding issues - including over a freeze on home repossessions. Speaking of Greece.... public faith in the Athens political classes won't be improved by the news that a former transport minister is due to appear before prosecutors after being stopped by traffic police. According to local media, Michalis Liapis was apprehended on suspicion of driving with fake number plates, no licence, and no insurance. Kathimerini reports that Liapis is already \u20ac500 lighter, and still needs to explain the alleged false plates to a court. Just flagging up a few stories by my colleagues this morning: GlaxoSmithKline to stop paying doctors to promote products Drug maker GlaxoSmithKline will no longer pay doctors to promote its products as it attempts to modernise at a difficult time for the company. The British pharmaceutical company will also stop paying bonuses to its sales staff based on the number of prescriptions written by doctors and will no longer pay doctors and medical professionals to attend conferences. Bob Diamond raises \u00a3200m to invest in African banks Bob Diamond, ousted as boss of Barclays last year following the Libor-rigging scandal, has staged a dramatic return by raising \u00a3200m in a stock market listed company targeting the acquisition of financial services companies in Africa. The American banker \u2013 often criticised for the size of his pay cheques \u2013 has become a non-executive director of a cash shell which has ambitious plans to buy into fast-growing African banks. Great British Bake Off boosts Dixons Dixons said the popularity of the BBC television series The Great British Bake Off was boosting sales of kitchen gadgets in the run-up toChristmas but warned of a challenging period ahead. The chief executive, Sebastian James, said all kinds of baking-related products were flying off the shelves, with Kitchenaid mixers in \"garish colours\" proving particularly popular. Over in Greece, central Bank governor Giorgos Provopoulos has presented his annual report this morning . As our correspondent Helena Smith reports, it\u2019s a mix of good and bad news. Greece\u2019s central bank governor rarely minces his words and today was no exception. Presenting the bank\u2019s monetary policy program to parliament, days before the 300-seat House goes into recess over Christmas, Giorgos Provopoulos broke the good news first: after six years mired in recession, the debt-stricken country was about to turn the corner. The economy would contract by 4.0% in 2013 and not by 4.6% as originally forecast, and will also achieve a primary budget surplus. But..... Breaking the bad news, the governor also sounded the alarm by warning that Greece\u2019s economic recovery was fragile and in danger of being derailed by mounting political uncertainty. In an atmosphere that has become increasingly electric politically, double elections next year for the European Parliament and regional authorities (which both take place in May) posed a particular danger, he said. \u201c[They] represent a justifiable cause for concern that political tensions will rise and polarization become more acute,\u201d he said urging consensus among the country\u2019s fractious political elite. Provopoulos\u2019 warning came as senior government officials admitted that relations with Greece\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors were especially strained even if consensus has been reached on revamping Greece\u2019s ailing defence industries. That breakthrough was highlighted this afternoon when the eurozone's working group released \u20ac1bn of loans to Athens shortly before eurozone finance ministers begin talks in Brussels. But the long negotiations between Greece and the Troika are still not over, Helena adds: Mission chiefs representing the EU, ECB and IMF left Athens today after failing to bridge differences over a number of issues not least the potentially explosive matter of banks repossessing homes to claim bad debts. Finance ministry sources are saying they won\u2019t be back until January \u201cand right now we have no idea when.\" Eurozone finance ministers will be gathering in Brussels tonight for another meeting of the eurogroup, and it could be a long haul. Top of the agenda -- finalising a deal on the outstanding points around European banking union in time for a leaders' Summit meeting later this week. EU officials have just tweeted that there won't be a press conference tonight.... Tomorrow, finance ministers from the rest of the EU join their euro colleagues for a full European Council meeting. And there are still plenty of hurdles over the details of banking union to clear up. The FT's Peter Spiegel has uploaded the 19-page discussion note circulated ahead of the meeting, which shows that finance ministers are still divided over these key issues: Who takes the decision to shut a failing European bank? (is the current plan too complicated? Who's really in charge?) The legal framework behind the new rescue fund that would recapitalise failed banks (Germany wants it tied into a new treaty, which takes time) (and crucially) Is there enough money in the pot to actually save Europe's banks in a crisis? Only, it seems, if the \u20ac500bn European Stability Mechanism (set up to fund sovereign bailouts) is used, and Germany opposes that (which is why the 'backstop problem' might not be on the agenda at all). US inflation data is out, and it's lower than expected. The cost of living in America was unchanged month-on-month in November, with falling gasoline prices cancelling out higher food and housing costs. On an annual basis, the US Consumer Prices Index rose 1.2%, up from 1.0% in October (but still almost a whole percentage point below Britain's inflation rate). Economists had expected prices to rise 0.1% month-on-month, and 1.3% annually. So, nothing to shock the Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee (the FOMC) as it starts its two-day meeting. We find out tomorrow if the Fed has taken the plunge to ease back on its bond-buying stimulus programme, which is currently pumping $85bn of new money into the US system each month. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale reckons the Fed should start winding back the programme soon: That bond buying is what is keeping equities up and the dollar down. The latter may suit the US economy; the former is simply storing up trouble for later. That's why tapering would be a good idea this week. Two interesting charts to flag up about the UK housing market. 1) Comprehensive lending data released this morning shows that one in every four pounds of mortgage loans are held against property in London postcodes. The postcode with the most mortgage debt is SW11 6 in South London (part of Wandsworth), followed by E14 9 (parts of of Tower Hamlets, including Canary Wharf and the Isle of Dogs). There is \u00a3227bn worth of home loans outstanding in the capital, compared to just \u00a326bn in the whole of Wales. 2) While UK house prices are at a new record high, that doesn't account for inflation. This chart, via Sky News's Ed Conway, shows how the average price in real terms is around 17% off the 2007 peak. London prices are close to new highs. City economists have been scribbling out their forecasts for UK inflation in 2014, after today's data (which showed the cost of living rising by 0.1 percentage point less than expected in November). Here's Reuters' story about Tom Hayes' court appearance this morning: Libor rate-rigging scandal trader pleads not guilty Rob Harbron, economist at the CEBR, has commented on this morning's drop in UK inflation to a four-year low of 2.1%: The largest contributor to this downward movement came from the food and non-alcoholic drinks sector, where annual price increases slowed to 2.8% - the smallest rise since September 2012. Low crop yields caused by poor weather conditions in 2012 had pushed up the prices of some fresh produce in November last year, but this effect has since fallen out. A second key factor easing pressure on the headline rate was the cost of home utilities. Annual price inflation on electricity and gas fell to 6.7% and 6.3% respectively, each down roughly two percentage points from October to reach their lowest rates since early 2013. This is the result of the timings of tariff hikes \u2013 none of the recently announced price increases had taken place by November, whereas the cost of home utilities started to push up CPI in the same month last year. This further improvement of the inflationary environment will help to reduce the squeeze on UK household spending power, a factor that is likely to help support consumer confidence. A robust expansion of the UK economy is expected for Q4 2013, boosted in part by consumer spending. However, despite today\u2019s good news for UK households, the gap between inflation and wage growth remains substantial. Total average wages rose year on year by just 0.8% in the three months to September 2013, and inflation is not expected to fall further as the effects of utility price hikes start to feed in. The outlook for the economy may be brightening, but the benefits brought by growth will take longer to reach the average household. Over at Southwark Crown Court, three men have pleaded not guilty to charges related to allegations of attempts to rig the Libor benchmark interest rates. Tom Hayes, a former UBS and Citigroup trader, and two former RP Martin brokers Terry Farr and James Gilmour, are the first people to appear in court over claims that attempts were made to manipulate Libor over several years. All three deny the charges, brought by the UK's Serious Fraud Office. The trial may not begin for over a year. Here's Press Association's early take: Former trader Tom Hayes today pleaded not guilty to eight charges in relation to allegations of Libor rate rigging. Hayes entered the pleas during a hearing at Southwark Crown Court. His trial will not take place until 2015. Charges of conspiracy to defraud cover a period from 2006 to 2010. Libor is the term for benchmark rates that underpin hundreds of trillions of dollars of contracts from mortgages to corporate lending. Two other defendants, Terry Farr and James Gilmour, denied separate charges. The WSJ has more details from the 'packed' courtroom: Three Charged in Libor Plead Not Guilty The rise in UK house prices to record levels (see 9.39am onwards) comes at a time when mortgage approvals are running at half their pre-crisis peak. That worries Josh Raymond of City Index, who tweets: Duncan Weldon, the TUC's senior economist, sums up the situation: UK inflation may rise again as this winter's energy price rises hit households, warns David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (as explained earlier, those tariff increases don't appear in November's inflation data). Kern says: The small fall in inflation will help ease the pressure felt by businesses and consumers at a time when earnings are still rising by less than 1%. It will also make good reading for the Bank of England's monetary policy committee as it tries to keep interest rates at a historic low for an extended period, and suggests that in the short term it is possible to combine low inflation with low interest rates. However inflation remains a concern for many businesses, and imminent energy rises may add to inflationary pressures in the months ahead. UK inflation also remains higher than in the euro area. New data this morning has confirmed that eurozone prices rose by just 0.9% year-on-year in November. That's a rise from October's inflation rate of 0.7%, which had prompted fears that the eurozone was sliding into deflation (as has already happened in Greece). Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, points out that real wages are falling in some parts of the eurozone, as in the UK: For consumers, the news is mixed. On the one hand, very low consumer price inflation is good for their purchasing power. However, this is countered by very weak wage growth. Indeed, given that overall Eurozone annual wage growth of 1.3% in the third quarter was lifted by German and French wages both rising by 1.7%, it is evident that workers in many countries are facing falling or essentially flat real incomes which clearly limits the ability of consumers to play a major role in helping recoveries to develop. The Labour party has also welcomed the drop in UK inflation, before pointing out that it means real wages in the UK are still shrinking. Catherine McKinnell MP, Labour's Shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said: This small fall in the inflation rate is welcome, but with prices still rising much faster than wages the cost-of-living crisis continues. Families and pensioners are still set to face inflation-busting hikes in energy prices this winter, which the ONS says are not in today's figures. After three damaging years of flatlining, working people are on average \u00a31600 a year worse off. But the Autumn Statement failed to set out a plan to tackle the cost-of-living crisis and earn our way to higher living standards for the many and not just a few. Labour would freeze energy bills until 2017 while we reform the energy market, make work pay by expanding free childcare for working parents and get at least 200,000 homes built a year by 2020. By opposing all these measures and giving a huge tax cut to people earning over \u00a3150,000 David Cameron has shown he only stands up for a privileged few. News that the cost of living is rising at its lowest rate in four years has been hailed by the Treasury as proof that the economy is on the right track: Here's the official comment: Inflation has fallen to its lowest level in four years. The government\u2019s long term economic plan is working. All parts of the economy are growing, the deficit is falling and jobs are being created. But the job is not done and the government will go on taking the tough decisions needed to create a sustainable recovery for all. Times remain tough for many people so wherever possible we have found the money to freeze fuel duty, freeze council tax and take 2.7 million people out of tax by increasing the tax free personal allowance. It's worth remembering, though, that Britain's easing inflation rate is partly due to global energy prices being stable recently. The cost of a barrel of oil almost doubled between 2009 and 2011 (from $50 to $100), driving up the cost of living (as that previous chart made clear). Here's two ONS graphs - one showing how the UK inflation rate has finally fallen close to the official target of 2%, for the first time in four years: While the other explains which factors pushed the inflation rate up, and which pulled it down. Computer gaming got costlier in November, according to the Office for National Statistics. It reports that items in its 'recreation &amp; culture' section rose by 0.4% between October and November this year, compared with a negligible change between the same two months in 2012: The upward contribution came from games, toys &amp; hobbies (particularly computer games) and data processing equipment. Two new computer game consoles launched in the UK last month, the XBox One and the PlayStation 4, compete with a roster of fresh games to play on 'em. The ONS also reported that UK food and non-alcoholic beverage prices also rose at a slower pace than a year ago: Prices, overall, were little changed between October and November 2013 compared with a rise of 1.1% between the same two months a year ago. The main downward contributions came from fruit, where prices rose by less than a year ago, and vegetables, where prices fell this year but rose a year ago. For some fresh produce, there were reports of low yields in 2012 caused by poor weather conditions. There was also a small downward effect from bread &amp; cereals where prices fell slightly this year but rose a year ago. And hotel and restaurant costs also rose at a lower rate between October and November than a year ago: The downward effect came from both accommodation services, particularly from hotel overnight stays, and catering services. The drop in UK inflation last month was partly because recent energy price rises have yet to feed into the calculations. The ONS warned: Prices, overall, were little changed between October and November 2013 compared with a rise of 0.6% between the same two months a year ago. The effect came almost entirely from gas and electricity and relates to the timing of price rises: none of the recently announced rises has entered the index this month whereas last winter\u2019s increases began to affect the index in November 2012. That suggests the inflation rate will pick up again once the tariff increase from the likes of British Gas and nPower hit our doormats. At 2.1%, UK inflation is still running at more than double the average pay rise. Average earnings are up by just 0.8% over the last year (we'll get new data on that tomorrow). So real wages continue to fall, and the living standards squeeze continues. The fall in UK inflation will be welcomed by the Bank of England, as it means less pressure to consider tightening monetary policy (it's official policy is to maintain rates at their record low of 0.5% until the jobless rate has fallen). House prices in London have led the way over the last year, according to the ONS, rising by an average of 12% in the 12 months to October. That's more than double the national average rise of 5.5%, which takes the average price to a new record high. But house prices are up! The Office for National Statistics reports that house prices across the UK rose by 5.5% in the 12 months to October, which is the fastest increase since September 2010 (according to ONS data). JUST IN: UK inflation has fallen to a four-year low. The Consumer prices index rose by 2.1% in November, down from 2.2% the previous month, which is the smallest increase since November 2009. More to follow: France's finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, has welcomed the formation of Angela Merkel's new coalition, and criticised her previous administration for being too focused on austerity. With the French economy at risk of sliding into recession, Moscovici hopes that the presence of the SPD around the cabinet table will help German to focus more on eurozone growth. Speaking on France 2 TV shortly before Merkel was voted back in, Moscovici declared: It's true that the previous administration was far too focused on austerity.... Now there is a Social Democratic partner ... I think we'll have a Germany that is more growth-oriented. Through the coalition discussions, the SPD persuaded Merkel to agree to the introduction of a national minimum wage (rather than individual industries hammering out deals). That could boost the spending power of poorer Germans. But the CDU baulked at the idea of raising taxes to fund additional government spending on infrastructure projects. The formalities are over - Angela Merkel is officially Germany's leader again. Over in Germany, Angela Merkel will be formally voted in as German chancellor this morning, for the third time, as the new coalition between her CDU/CSU party and the Social Democrats gets down to business. Although the CDU-SPD coalition is new, there's no change at the top of one key department. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble remains as finance minister, which suggests little change in Germany's focus on fiscal consolidation as the cure to eurozone woes. Our economics correspondent, Phillip Inman, sees a lost opportunity. For Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, his reappointment is a nightmare: they have massive debts to pay, and according to the Sch\u00e4uble doctrine those debts must be honoured. For Europe's low-skilled, poorly paid workers and the young, it is a message that austerity must go on while the benefits of recovery, in the form of corporate profits and tax receipts, are transferred to the old and wealthy. Look who's back! Bob Diamond has returned to the City this morning, almost 18 months after quitting as Barclays CEO over the Libor scandal. Diamond's new shell company, Atlas Mara, has raised \u00a3200m by listing on the London Stock Exchange. It will use the money to invest in African banks. Diamond founded Atlas Mara with billionaire entrepreneur Ashish Thakkar, chief executive of Mara Group. Reuters has more details: The proceeds from the initial public offering included a $20 million investment by its founders. The vehicle will be managed by Atlas Merchant Capital, the merchant bank Diamond has set up in New York with a view to expand into sub-Saharah African banks and financial services. Economists and traders will be glued to their terminals in an hour's time when the latest UK inflation data, for November, flashes up. City analysts reckon there will be no change in the rising cost of living, with the Consumer Prices Index expected to rise by 2.2%, matching October. As economics reporter Katie Allen explains, that would mean real wages were still shrinking . The consumer price index measure of inflation is expected to hold at 2.2% in November according to the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll. But some economists see the rate dropping to 2% while others have pencilled in a rise to 2.5%. Inflation has been above average annual earnings growth for several years now and the latest official figures put pay growth at 0.8%. The big transport (and political) news in Britain today is that a government report into airport congestion has recommended building new runways at either Heathrow or Gatwick. My colleague Andy Sparrow is covering the report live here: Heathrow expansion - Airports Commission publishes interim report: Politics live blog And our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham has the story: A new battle looms over a Heathrow third runway after the Airports Commission said additional capacity was needed in the south-east of England, with extra runways at London's biggest airport foremost among the options it will study before issuing its final recommendation, along with an extra runway at Gatwick. The government-appointed independent commission, led by Sir Howard Davies has issued a shortlist of three options for building new runways in the south-east in its interim report. The options set out by Davies are: a third runway to the north of Heathrow, a second proposal for Heathrow expansion put forward by the Heathrow Hub group, and a new second runway to the south of Gatwick. Heathrow and Gatwick airports shortlisted for new runways So, no joy for 'Boris Island' -- instead, the prospect of even more flights over the capital, including its more salubrious 'burbs. Once you've splashed out on a new car, of course, you've got to insure the thing. And Britain's Competition Commission is concerned that motorists may be being shunted in the pocket. After conducting a review of the \u00a311bn private motor insurance market, the CC reckons that the market \"is not working well for motorists\". It reckons that insurers of the driver who wasn't at fault in an accident are running up unnecessary charges (repairs, replacement cars and the like), meaning the 'at fault' driver's insurers pick up the bill. Ultimately, everyone suffers, with up to \u00a3200m of extra costs needing to be spread across premiums. As Alasdair Smith of the CC explains: There is insufficient incentive for insurers to keep costs down even though they are themselves on the receiving end of the problem. More here: Car insurance too high, says Competition Commission Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Some mildly encouraging news to start the day - European car sales rose last month, for the third month in a row. ACEA, the industry body, reported that sales across the EU in November were 1.2% higher than the previous year -- meaning a hat-trick of annual gains (see chart above) as the battered auto sector steers towards Christmas. But the bulk of the increase was due to continued strong demand in the UK (where many cars appear to be being snapped up on credit ), and Spain (where the government has offered a series of 'cash-for-bangers' schemes to encourage demand). France, teetering on the edge of recession, continued to see its car market shrink, though. As ACEA explains: In November, the UK (+7.0%) and Spanish (+15.1%) markets contributed to the overall 1.2% upturn. Demand in Germany (-2.0%), France (-4.0%) and Italy (-4.5%) was lower than in the same month last year. In total, the EU* counted 938,021 new registrations. In absolute figures, this represents the third lowest level recorded to date** for a month of November. It's been a tough year for the sector, with manufacturers selling 2.7% fewer cars so far than in 2012. Much of 2013 must look like a write-off to car makers -- they must hope that 2014 will be better. Some manufacturers struggled rather more than others. Fiat reported a 5.8% drop in sales, while GM registrations are down 2.9% and Peugeot Citroen saw sales down 1.2%. Renault, though, posted an 8.9% surge during the month, and Toyota were up 6.9%. Lots more to follow... including the latest UK inflation reading at 9.30am, a Eurogroup meeting of finance ministers in Brussels, and drugs maker GSK announcing a clampdown on its payments model....",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has robustly defended his forward guidance policy in parliament against critics who argue it is confusing and has done little to persuade markets that an interest rate rise can be delayed for three years while the economy mends. Speaking to the House of Lords economics committee, Carney said businesses and consumers understood that forward guidance meant interest rates would stay low until unemployment falls to 7%, which the central bank predicts will happen in 2016. Carney said: \"A return to growth is not the same as a return to normality\", and base rates should remain at the historically low 0.5% level until the recovery was established. He spoke as the Office for National Statistics revealed that the consumer prices measure of inflation slowed to 2.1% in November from 2.2% in October and was at its lowest since November 2009. The move closer to the Bank of England's government-set target of 2% will give policymakers more leeway to leave interest rates at their record low. Carney told the committee Britain's return to growth was sufficient to justify resisting calls to increase the quantitative easing (QE) stimulus programme, which Threadneedle Street has held steady for the last two years. MPs have accused Carney of establishing a highly technical policy of forward guidance that relies on several caveats, or knockouts; this reliance has, they say, undermined the simplicity of the message. Forward guidance includes clauses that allow the bank to push up interest rates should it believe inflation is likely to increase sharply. Markets have estimated that interest rates will need to rise in 2015 in response to a sustained increase in GDP and higher-than-expected inflation.

    "webTitle": "Network Rail to be 'government body', adding \u00a330bn to UK national debt", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Network Rail will be reclassified as a government body in 2014 as part of a package of changes to the public finances, adding \u00a330bn to Britain's national debt, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has announced. Because the government plays a significant role in overseeing Network Rail, through the Office of the Rail Regulator, and the taxpayer would inevitably be left picking up the bill for keeping the trains running if Network Rail collapsed, the ONS says it is best considered a \"central government body\". That will bump up public sector net debt for 2012-13 by approximately \u00a330bn, or 2% of GDP, when the change is implemented next year \u2013 and will fuel the debate about the size of the public subsidy for the railway network. Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin said in a statement: \"The government welcomes the ONS review and has always been committed to the transparent reporting of public liabilities.\" He added: \"I am committed to ensuring that Network Rail maintains the operational flexibility to continue to deliver a safe, punctual rail network and increased capacity for our busy railways and that it is able to attract a high calibre of staff, while still providing value for money and being accountable to Parliament\". The announcement came as part of an ONS consultation on plans to implement pan-European standards on calculating taxation, public spending and debt, known as ESA10. As well as the national debt, public sector net borrowing \u2013 the amount the Treasury has to borrow each year to fund its day-to-day spending \u2013 is also likely to increase, by \u00a32.5bn, as a result of the reclassification of Network Rail. The Royal Mail pension scheme, which was brought on to the Treasury's books when it decided to underwrite the scheme in April 2012, will also have to be treated differently. Instead of a short-term boost to the government's coffers from taking charge of the Royal Mail scheme's assets, the ONS will record the transfer as negative, because over time the assets are likely to fall short of the pension liabilities, by approximately \u00a39bn. \"It may be that this shortfall in the pension scheme will be best reflected by a capital expenditure by government at the point of transfer in April 2012. This would increase public sector net borrowing in that period by \u00a39bn,\" the ONS said in a statement on Tuesday. It is negotiating with the statistical body Eurostat about the precise details of the changes. Taken together with other changes demanded by the new European rules, the ONS said the overall impact of implementing ESA10 could be an increase in public borrowing of \u00a337bn for 2012-13.",

Retail analyst Richard Hyman, a consultant at Verdict Research, said: \"Screwing your suppliers is something that is easy to do but the implications of that are something quite far reaching. \"It is very important for retailers to look after their partners as well as their customers. The pain and the benefit have to be shared out with a reasonable degree of democracy.\" Debenhams shares were down 3% in afternoon trading. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 December 2013 because Debenhams spent \u00a325m on a facelift for its Oxford Street branch, not \u00a325bn as the original said.",

      "bodyText": "Black Friday could next year overtake Easter to become UK electricals retailers' third most important sales day after Christmas and Boxing Day, according to the Dixons boss, Seb James. James said the US-inspired discount day, which falls on the first weekend in December, had been Dixons' fourth most successful trading day of the year, and would kick off the Christmas rush in future. \"I think it is really going to become part of the UK retail market for everyone,\" he said. He said the idea was good for a large retailer such as Dixons, as it could plan with manufacturers to offer big deals on items such as TVs by placing special large orders that preserved profit margins. \"It definitely pulls forward and then pushes back sales, but you can make money,\" James said. There was a risk, however, that the discount day could leave shoppers expecting deals all through the runup to Christmas, retailers' busiest trading period of the year, he warned. Dixons said the popularity of the BBC television series The Great British Bake Off was boosting sales of kitchen gadgets in the runup to Christmas but warned of a challenging period ahead. James said baking-related products of all kinds were flying off the shelves, with Kitchenaid mixers in \"garish colours\" proving particularly popular. The group behind Currys and PC World reported a first-half underlying pre-tax profit of \u00a330.2m in the six months to 31 October, up from \u00a314m in the same period last year. Like-for-like sales \u2013 those stripping out the impact of stores which have been open for less than a year \u2013 increased by 6% over the period. The UK and Ireland business performed particularly well, with like-for-like sales up 9%, and sales were up 3% on the same measure in northern Europe. The group said like-for-like sales in Greece were down 14% in the first half, however, as the economic storm persisted and as a much cooler summer this year hit sales of air conditioning units, which boomed a year earlier amid a heatwave. \"Our Greek business continues to grow market share against some gusty headwinds,\" James said. Total group sales rose to \u00a33.43bn from \u00a33.2bn. Sales were boosted by demand for the iPad Air tablet and large televisions, as well as by baking products. Boxing Day marks the beginning of the biggest week of trading for the Dixons group. James warned, however, that the second half of the year was likely to prove more challenging overall amid a weak consumer backdrop and as the benefits reaped after the collapse of the rival company Comet at the end of 2012 made for a difficult comparative period. \"We are cautious as there are headwinds in many of our markets. The macro economy is still quiet, especially for discretionary spending like this,\" he said.",

The strong recovery should then push it back up a little above target (to 2.2%) by the end of 2015, as the labour market tightens.\" Against the backdrop of political tussling over the squeeze on living standards, the Treasury welcomed the fall in inflation. A spokesman said: \"Inflation has fallen to its lowest level in four years. The government's long-term economic plan is working. All parts of the economy are growing, the deficit is falling and jobs are being created. But the job is not done and the government will go on taking the tough decisions needed to create a sustainable recovery for all.\" Catherine McKinnell MP, Labour's shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, said: \"This small fall in the inflation rate is welcome, but with prices still rising much faster than wages the cost-of-living crisis continues. Families and pensioners are still set to face inflation-busting hikes in energy prices this winter.\" The main downward effect on inflation last month came from food and non-alcoholic drinks: fruit prices rose by less than a year ago, and vegetables prices fell compared with 2012 when bad weather had hit crops and pushed up prices. The biggest upward pressure on inflation came from petrol prices, which fell by less than a year ago, and there was some effect from dearer computer games too. Separately, the ONS published data on costs for manufacturers and what they are charging for their goods \u2013 so-called factory gate prices. Their input costs last month were down 1% on a year earlier. Factory gate inflation was 0.8%, just below forecasts of 0.9%.",

The US banker, often criticised for the level of his pay during his 15 years at Barclays, has become a nonexecutive director of a cash shell that has raised \u00a3200m from a stock market listing in London, although registered in the British Virgin Islands. Along with his co-founder, Ashish Thakkar \u2013 a British national now based in Dubai \u2013 Diamond has special \"founder-preferred shares\" in the new vehicle, known as Atlas Mara Co-Nvest, which give the pair payouts if the share price rises above a certain level. Atlas Mara Co-Nvest is based on Diamond's New York firm Atlas Merchant Capital and Thakkar's Mara range of businesses in 19 African countries. The two companies have invested $20m in the cash shell. Thakkar, often described as Africa's youngest billionaire, started his first IT companies in 1995 at the age of 15 in Uganda and is one of the World Economic Forum's young global leaders. In a stock market announcement, Atlas Mara Co-Nvest said that although it was not involved in any discussions with target companies it could make acquisitions anywhere in the world, and was likely to pick Africa. To counter concerns that shell companies often tie up investors' cash without making deals, the business will be wound up in 12 months if no deals have been concluded by then. Arnold Ekpe, a former boss of Africa's Ecobank, has been appointed chairman of the company, on an annual fee of $125,000. The company has also named a number of non-executive directors, including Rachel Robbins, a former vice-president of the International Finance Corporation, who will get $85,000 a year. Ekpe is also receiving 50,000 five-year options over the shares, which listed at $10, and the non-executive directors are getting 37,500. Neither Diamond nor Thakkar is receiving any options or fees. The prospectus shows a higher fee, of $500,000, will go to Jyrki Koskelo, a former executive of the World Bank who will advise on potential acquisitions. The founder-preferred shares give a payout if the shares rise above $11.50 for 10 consecutive days after an acquisition. The payout is based on 20% of the difference between $11.50 and the share price. The 133-page prospectus said that while Barclays could face litigation over Libor fixing, Atlas Mara Co-Nvest does not believe it will have \"an adverse impact on the company or its ability to make the acquisition (or subsequent acquisitions) or on MrDiamond's ability to perform his role for the company\".",

      "bodyText": "The political row over falling living standards was stoked on Tuesday as it emerged that earnings-squeezed and pension-poor Britons born in the 1960s and 70s need inherited wealth to be better off in retirement than people born in earlier decades. After an autumn in which the cost of living has dominated Westminster debate, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said its research showed the days when each generation could expect to be better off than their predecessors might be ending. The in-depth survey of people born between the Battle of Britain in 1940 and the arrival of Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street in 1979 found that a decade in which real incomes have stagnated \u2013 coupled with changes to pensions and high house prices \u2013 has made life tougher for people currently in their 30s, 40s and early 50s than those born earlier. The IFS said living standards for those currently considered to be in the prime of their working lives were now dependent on wealth passed down the generations, and that this was heavily skewed towards the already better-off. Andrew Hood, a research economist at IFS and an author of the report, said: \"Since the second world war, successive cohorts have enjoyed higher incomes and living standards than their parents. Yet the incomes and wealth of those born in the 1960s and 70s look no higher than the cohorts who came before them. As a result, younger cohorts are likely to have to rely on inheritances to be better off in retirement than their predecessors.\" Hood said the IFS had not yet studied what sort of retirement might be expected by those born in the 80s and 90s, but there was nothing to suggest the outlook had improved. The main findings of the IFS report were: \u2022 Since the war, steady growth has meant each generation had higher incomes and living standards than the one before. \u2022 Those born in the 60s and 70s are less likely to own a home. \u2022 The trend stalled in the past decade, with individuals born in the 60s and 70s having the same take-home pay as workers born a decade earlier. \u2022 The children of the 60s and 70s had higher incomes during early adulthood than their predecessors but spent the extra. \u2022 Compared with those born in the 40s and 50s, they are likely to have smaller private pension pots and will find that the state pension replaces a smaller slice of their earnings prior to retirement. The IFS said: \"The main conclusion is that individuals born in the 60s and 70s are likely to be reliant on inherited wealth if they are to be any better off in retirement than their predecessors. Many more people in younger cohorts expect to inherit wealth; but expected inheritances are distributed unequally and are higher for those who are already wealthier. The results suggest that the rapid improvement in economic outcomes across birth cohorts that we have seen in recent decades may be coming to a halt.\" In recent weeks, political parties have traded blows over the cost of living, with Ed Miliband making it the focus of his attack on the government. George Osborne last week said Britain was poorer because of the financial and economic crisis of 2007-09, when Labour was in power. A government spokesman said: \"The only way to raise living standards is to raise productivity by continuing to implement the economic plan that has got the economy growing, created 1.4 million new private sector jobs and cut the deficit by a third. \"As part of this plan, we are committed to protecting pensioners, who have worked hard all their lives, to ensure their dignity in retirement. \"In addition to introducing the triple lock on the basic state pension, we have also protected a number of pensioner benefits \u2013 for instance, free bus passes and TV licences. We are reforming the UK's state pension system to be more sustainable for the future and widening access to a workplace pension. These combined reforms will improve the incomes of 9 million people currently facing inadequate income in retirement.\" But Angus Hanton of the Intergenerational Foundation said: \"This report shows rapidly growing intergenerational imbalances where younger generations face soaring costs of housing and education while receiving lower earnings and pensions, contrasting with the relative prosperity of older generations. \"Policymakers should not equate old age with need. They are protecting older, wealthier generations while stripping benefits from families and young people.\" The thinktank said many of the factors adversely affecting those born in the 60s and 70s were the \"straightforward consequences\" of recent trends. After strong growth in the 80s and 90s, real incomes are no higher now than they were a decade ago and were growing only weakly even before the financial crash. Over the same period, companies have made a rapid switch from final salary pension schemes to less generous defined contribution schemes in which younger workers have been accumulating less private pension wealth. \"Policy changes \u2013 themselves often driven by the inevitable fiscal pressures associated with an ageing society \u2013 explain the key changes across cohorts in state pension entitlements.\" The IFS said more research needed to be done into why those born in the 60s and 70s \"spent all, and saved none, of the additional income that they had in young adulthood relative to their predecessors\". \"Inheritances look like the major potential reason why the later economic position of cohorts born in the 60s and 70s could yet turn out better than that of their predecessors, on average. Only 28% of individuals born in the early 40s could expect an inheritance, but that rose to 70% for people born in the 70s. The study found that of those born in 1972-78, 78% of the wealthiest third and 45% of the poorest third expected a future inheritance, while 35% of the wealthiest third and 12% of the poorest third expected a future inheritance worth at least \u00a3100,000. \"Expected future inheritances also tend to be concentrated within the same households: individuals expecting inheritances are far more likely to have partners who also expect them. \"In combination with the lack of positive signs with respect to other economic indicators, this suggests that the economic fate of the 60s and 70s generations may be relatively dependent on the fortunes of their parents. But the prevalence and value of expected future inheritances are distributed unequally, with households that are already relatively wealthy far more likely to benefit.\" The IFS said that during their early adulthood, those born in the 60s and 70s enjoyed much higher take-home incomes than previous generations at a similar age. At 30, the real median income for someone born in the 70s was 20% higher than someone born in the 60s, 52% higher than that of someone born in the 50s and 77% higher than for someone born in the 40s. \"These income differences between birth cohorts at younger ages were (at least) matched by differences in spending\", the IFS said. \"As a result, the 1960s and 1970s cohorts had higher living standards during early adulthood than their predecessors had, but they have not actively saved more take-home income than their predecessors had by the same stage in life.\"",

      "body": "<p>The political row over falling living standards was stoked on Tuesday as it emerged that earnings-squeezed and pension-poor Britons born in the 1960s and 70s need inherited wealth to be better off in retirement than people born in earlier decades.</p> <p>After an autumn in which the cost of living has dominated Westminster debate, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said its research showed the days when each generation could expect to be better off than their predecessors might be ending.</p> <p>The in-depth survey of people born between the Battle of Britain in 1940 and the arrival of Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street in 1979 found that a decade in which real incomes have stagnated \u2013 coupled with changes to pensions and high house prices \u2013 has made life tougher for people currently in their 30s, 40s and early 50s than those born earlier.</p> <p>The IFS said living standards for those currently considered to be in the prime of their working lives were now dependent on wealth passed down the generations, and that this was heavily skewed towards the already better-off.</p> <p>Andrew Hood, a research economist at IFS and an author of the report, said: \"Since the second world war, successive cohorts have enjoyed higher incomes and living standards than their parents. Yet the incomes and wealth of those born in the 1960s and 70s look no higher than the cohorts who came before them. As a result, younger cohorts are likely to have to rely on inheritances to be better off in retirement than their predecessors.\"</p> <p>Hood said the IFS had not yet studied what sort of retirement might be expected by those born in the 80s and 90s, but there was nothing to suggest the outlook had improved.</p> <p>The main findings of the IFS report were: \u2022 Since the war, steady growth has meant each generation had higher incomes and living standards than the one before.</p> <p>\u2022 Those born in the 60s and 70s are less likely to own a home.</p> <p>\u2022 The trend stalled in the past decade, with individuals born in the 60s and 70s having the same take-home pay as workers born a decade earlier.</p> <p>\u2022 The children of the 60s and 70s had higher incomes during early adulthood than their predecessors but spent the extra.</p> <p>\u2022 Compared with those born in the 40s and 50s, they are likely to have smaller private pension pots and will find that the state pension replaces a smaller slice of their earnings prior to retirement.</p> <p>The IFS said: \"The main conclusion is that individuals born in the 60s and 70s are likely to be reliant on inherited wealth if they are to be any better off in retirement than their predecessors. Many more people in younger cohorts expect to inherit wealth; but expected inheritances are distributed unequally and are higher for those who are already wealthier. The results suggest that the rapid improvement in economic outcomes across birth cohorts that we have seen in recent decades may be coming to a halt.\"</p> <p>In recent weeks, political parties have traded blows over the cost of living, with Ed Miliband making it the focus of his attack on the government. George Osborne last week said Britain was poorer because of the financial and economic crisis of 2007-09, when Labour was in power.</p> <p>A government spokesman said: \"The only way to raise living standards is to raise productivity by continuing to implement the economic plan that has got the economy growing, created 1.4&#xa0;million new private sector jobs and cut the deficit by a third.</p> <p>\"As part of this plan, we are committed to protecting pensioners, who have worked hard all their lives, to ensure their dignity in retirement.</p> <p>\"In addition to introducing the triple lock on the basic state pension, we have also protected a number of pensioner benefits \u2013 for instance, free bus passes and TV licences. We are reforming the UK's state pension system to be more sustainable for the future and widening access to a workplace pension. These combined reforms will improve the incomes of 9&#xa0;million people currently facing inadequate income in retirement.\" But Angus Hanton of the Intergenerational Foundation said: \"This report shows rapidly growing intergenerational imbalances where younger generations face soaring costs of housing and education while receiving lower earnings and pensions, contrasting with the relative prosperity of older generations.</p> <p>\"Policymakers should not equate old age with need. They are protecting older, wealthier generations while stripping benefits from families and young people.\"</p> <p>The thinktank said many of the factors adversely affecting those born in the 60s and 70s were the \"straightforward consequences\" of recent trends.</p> <p>After strong growth in the 80s and 90s, real incomes are no higher now than they were a decade ago and were growing only weakly even before the financial crash. Over the same period, companies have made a rapid switch from final salary pension schemes to less generous defined contribution schemes in which younger workers have been accumulating less private pension wealth.</p> <p>\"Policy changes \u2013 themselves often driven by the inevitable fiscal pressures associated with an ageing society \u2013 explain the key changes across cohorts in state pension entitlements.\"</p> <p>The IFS said more research needed to be done into why those born in the 60s and 70s \"spent all, and saved none, of the additional income that they had in young adulthood relative to their predecessors\".</p> <p>\"Inheritances look like the major potential reason why the later economic position of cohorts born in the 60s and 70s could yet turn out better than that of their predecessors, on average. Only 28% of individuals born in the early 40s could expect an inheritance, but that rose to 70% for people born in the 70s.</p> <p>The study found that of those born in 1972-78, 78% of the wealthiest third and 45% of the poorest third expected a future inheritance, while 35% of the wealthiest third and 12% of the poorest third expected a future inheritance worth at least \u00a3100,000. \"Expected future inheritances also tend to be concentrated within the same households: individuals expecting inheritances are far more likely to have partners who also expect them.</p> <p>\"In combination with the lack of positive signs with respect to other economic indicators, this suggests that the economic fate of the 60s and 70s generations may be relatively dependent on the fortunes of their parents. But the prevalence and value of expected future inheritances are distributed unequally, with households that are already relatively wealthy far more likely to benefit.\"</p> <p>The IFS said that during their early adulthood, those born in the 60s and 70s enjoyed much higher take-home incomes than previous generations at a similar age.</p> <p>At 30, the real median income for someone born in the 70s was 20% higher than someone born in the 60s, 52% higher than that of someone born in the 50s and 77% higher than for someone born in the 40s.</p> <p>\"These income differences between birth cohorts at younger ages were (at least) matched by differences in spending\", the IFS said. \"As a result, the 1960s and 1970s cohorts had higher living standards during early adulthood than their predecessors had, but they have not actively saved more take-home income than their predecessors had by the same stage in life.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest banks benefited from a \"too big to fail\" subsidy from the taxpayer of \u00a338bn last year, according to a leading economic thinktank which argued that they are not giving enough back to the public. The New Economics Foundation (Nef) said the big four \u2013 Barclays, HSBC and the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 were \"failing to make themselves useful in the economy\" despite the 10% rise in the value of the taxpayer's implicit support. On Tuesday the controversy over the lack of lending to businesses is expected to be reignited when banks publish their loans broken down by the 9,000 postcodes around the UK. The report by Nef came as the City of London Corporation, the local authority for the City, said the amount paid in corporation tax by the financial services industry had halved since 2007 to \u00a36.5bn. The corporation said that with employment taxes included the total paid to the exchequer was \u00a365bn in 2012/13 \u2013 12% of the chancellor George Osborne's total tax take. The amount of tax being paid by the financial services sector is down from the \u00a368bn in 2007 \u2013 the year before the banking crisis, when the industry contributed 14% of total taxes \u2013 largely as a result of the drop in the amount paid in corporation tax. The figures compiled by the City of London include taxes from corporation tax \u2013 a tax on profits \u2013 employment taxes, the \u00a31.6bn paid in the chancellor's levy on bank balance sheets and irrecoverable valued added tax. Tony Greenham, head of finance and business at Nef, said the size of the implicit subsidy being provided to banks was staggering. Nef calculates the lower borrowing costs that banks enjoy as a result of the market's expectations that the government is ready to bail out the sector. The impact is greatest on Barclays \u2013 of \u00a311.7bn \u2013 and smallest on HSBC of \u00a34.6bn. But the total \"too to big to fail\" subsidy has fallen from a \u00a353bn peak in 2009, but is more than the \u00a39.5bn in 2007, before banks were bailed out by the taxpayer. Greenham said: \"UK taxpayers are still on the hook for the big banks. \"UK retail banking remains a curious kind of public-private partnership, but a highly unequal one \u2013 the public take the losses while private interests take the profits. \"Despite huge government subsidies, big banks still aren't supporting the interests of the real economy. \"Even government attempts to bribe the banks into lending seem to have had little effect.\" The analysis of the banks comes amid continued costly scandals for the financial services industry which the London School of Economics has estimated at \u00a3100bn for 10 major banks in the five years to 2012. Further scrutiny of this data by UBS bank analysts concludes that the total cost of the scandals is 20% of the stock market value of banks and the equivalent of five years of dividends wiped out by the cost of fines, redress and other writedowns. The bank analysts at UBS lowered their dividend forecasts for two banks \u2013 Barclays and Citigroup \u2013 as a result of future litigation risks. RBS capital boost Royal Bank of Scotland has taken a step towards extricating itself from taxpayer support after being released from an agreement with the government to provide another \u00a38bn of capital in an emergency. The Bank of England's decision to allow RBS to terminate the so-called contingent capital facility will save the state-controlled bank \u00a3320m next year. The CCF, put in place during the banking crisis in 2009, was to have cost RBS \u00a31.6bn over the five years but it will now end one year earlier than planned. The complex arrangement meant that the Treasury would put another \u00a38bn into RBS if its crucial capital ratios were to fall below 5%. That closely watched measure is currently double that level. RBS said it had approval from the Bank of England's regulation arm, the Prudential Regulatory Authority, for the move. Some \u00a345bn of taxpayer funds are tied up in RBS shares, which closed last night at 320p, up 1.5%, but less than the 500p average price at which the stake was bought.",
