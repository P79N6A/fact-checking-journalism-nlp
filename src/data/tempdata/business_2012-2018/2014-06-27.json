HP took an $8.8bn impairment charge in November 2012 for its purchase of Autonomy just over a year earlier, with more than $5bn of that linked to what HP said at the time were \"serious accounting improprieties, misrepresentation and disclosure failures\". The size of the loss, and the speed with which it occurred, mark the deal as one of the most disastrous done by a major company in recent years.

      "bodyText": "Payday loan firm Wonga faces the prospect of a damaging criminal investigation after the City of London police force said it was considering referring fake legal letters sent out by the lender to the national policing lead for fraud. The payday lender was fined \u00a32.6m earlier this week for sending letters to struggling borrowers in the names of fabricated law firms \u2013 and in some cases charging an administration fee for their services. Initially it seemed Wonga might escape a police investigation, but amid intense pressure for action \u2013 including from the head of the Law Society, Desmond Hudson, who said Wonga's \"dishonest activity\" could amount to blackmail and deception \u2013 the force said it is now reassessing the case for an investigation. In a statement issued late on Friday, it said: \"Now the regulator's investigation has concluded, and a compensation agreement has been reached with Wonga, the City of London police will reassess whether a criminal investigation is now appropriate.\" Wonga, which offers short-term loans at an annualised interest rate of 5,853%, sent letters to thousands of borrowers under the names of nonexistent law firms. The letters were typically headed \"Urgent message\" and began: \"We have been instructed by Wonga to recover from you a debt of \u00a3X \u2026\" Hudson said: \"It seems that the intention behind Wonga's dishonest activity was to make customers believe that their outstanding debt had been passed to a genuine law firm. \"It looks like they also wanted customers to believe that court action undertaken by a genuine law firm would follow if the debt was not repaid. Depending on the precise circumstances of what has happened, that could amount to blackmail and deception, as well as offences under the Solicitors Act 1974 and Legal Services Act 2007.\" The Law Society said it had asked the Metropolitan police to investigate three offences: one of obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception and blackmail and separate offences under the Solicitors Act 1974 and the Legal Services Act 2007. A spokesman for Wonga said it was focusing on compensating the 45,000 customers affected by a \"historic\" debt collection issue. He added: \"We have been working over the past two years with two regulators \u2013 first the Office of Fair Trading and then the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 and no one has been interviewed or contacted by the police in that time.\" It emerged earlier this week that City of London police discussed the Wonga case with regulators a year ago but it was decided it should be left to regulators so the 45,000 consumers affected were not delayed in receiving their compensation. Between October 2008 and November 2010 Wonga sent letters to customers in arrears under the names Chainey D'Amato &amp; Shannon and Barker &amp; Lowe Legal Recoveries. The use of the fake law firms was uncovered by the former consumer credit regulator, the OFT, in 2011, after Wonga was asked to disclose information about its debt collection practices. Wonga customers sent the fake legal letters will receive a flat-rate \u00a350 settlement offer to reflect distress and inconvenience they have suffered. Some will also receive a refund of the charges incurred for being referred to Barker &amp; Lowe or Chainey D'Amato \u2013 estimated at \u00a3400,000.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Philip Clarke survived his third annual meeting as chief executive of Tesco. Will he be there for a fourth? Half the City is playing the game of fantasy chief executive, and some former Tesco directors have been muttering darkly about Clarke's supposed strategic errors and how the company's woes shouldn't be dumped on former boss Sir Terry Leahy. Clarke certainly has made mistakes. He should have binned Leahy's US folly, the Fresh &amp; Easy chain in the US, immediately. But shareholders have good reason to ditch Clarke only if they believe his UK strategy is wrong and that he has misread a market where discounters are on the march. This boils down to a simple question: do investors believe Tesco should cut its prices deeply, take the fight to Aldi and Lidl, and accept that profit margins of 5% are no longer viable? \"Be in no doubt, reducing prices doesn't result in an immediate increase in sales,\" said Clarke. \"These things take time.\" In other words, he is not the man to launch a price war. He is seeking \"the right blend of price, quality, range and service\", as he put it in February. The sermon sounds complacent. The view from the tills, as expressed by one shareholder-employee, is that customers don't want vouchers and \"price promises\", they want lower prices. Over at Morrisons \u2013 where the latest sales figures were even weaker than Tesco's \u2013 Dalton Philips also has a very different take from Clarke's. The \"brutal reality\", he said this week, is that big grocers need to fight back or risk discounters grabbing 25% of the market, versus 8% today. Look what Ryanair and easyJet did to traditional airline carriers, he argues. And look at how Carrefour, the big boy in France, has regained market share by cutting prices. Do Tesco shareholders really want to sanction a price war, which would mean accepting a lower share price, at least in the short-term? Most, one suspects, are not convinced by Clarke's strategy but still hope he might be proved correct. Another profits warning would force them to get off the fence. If it doesn't happen, Clarke ought to be safe. But a warning after three years of heavy capital investment would surely force a strategic rethink. The Bank of England's new normal Another day, another message from the governor of the Bank of England on interest rates. This time Mark Carney cited 2.5% as the market's definition of a \"new normal\" bank rate and said it could arrive in the first quarter of 2017. An \"old normal\" rate was 5%, he told the Today programme, but the world has changed. UK consumers and the UK government are still heavily indebted, the eurozone is weak, the pound is strong and banks have to hold more capital and will pass on costs to borrowers. One can understand why Carney wants to return attention to the Bank's \"big picture\" view that increases in rates will be \"gradual and limited\". It was a mistake to ignite a debate on the actual timing of the first rise, as Carney did in his Mansion House speech when he made the electrifying remark that the moment could come \"sooner than markets currently expect\". Inevitably, the comment would be over-analysed, notwithstanding the get-out clauses. Equally inevitably, Carney would be obliged to clarify, or at least emphasise, the uncertainties in the data. As a result, MP Pat McFadden at the Treasury select committee this week called Carney \"an unreliable boyfriend\". The label will stick. What to make of this latest talk of the \"new normal\" being 2.5%? The precision jars. The Bank's forecasting record on the economy is poor. It is perfectly possible that bank rate could be stuck at 1.5% in early 2017 if growth in wages continues to be sluggish and if the eurozone is still in a funk. On the other hand, one can imagine the \"new normal\" being close to the \"old normal\" if events turn out differently. Mervyn King, Carney's predecessor, had a stock answer on interest rates: decisions are made by the monetary policy committee on a month-by-month basis. It was not illuminating but it was accurate. If Carney felt such stonewalling would be unhelpful in the current climate, his \"gradual and limited\" phrase struck the right note \u2013 reassuring but vague. Why offer a hostage to fortune by talking actual numbers? Barclays back in the news for the wrong reasons \"I have always made it clear that cultural change will take time,\" says Antony Jenkins, chief executive of Barclays, in a memo to staff describing his \"deep disappointment and frustration that our business is back in the news this week for the wrong reasons\". Perfectly true. Jenkins has often said his admirable ethical crusade is a five- to 10-year affair and that there will be \"challenges\" along the way. Even so, copping a big fine for running a dodgy \"dark pool\" would look naive. To recap, the New York attorney general alleges \"a pretty flagrant example of fraud\" at Barclays in New York. Eric Schneiderman contends that the bank was using devious tactics to lure unwary investors into a private trading pool full of sharks, aka aggressive high-frequency traders. That the supposed fish are actually big institutional investors, who ought to know to carry shark-protection equipment, is beside the point. Schneiderman's main allegation is that Barclays lied to customers about how many \"predatory\" high-speed trading robots were present. Jenkins has dispatched the group's general counsel and brought in \"substantial external resource\" to establish the facts. A full response will follow. \"If there has been wrongdoing, we will address it quickly and decisively,\" he says. Fine, but if wrongdoing is admitted or proved, Jenkins will have to explain how Barclays failed to spot it. Regulators have made no secret of their wish to peer into these dark, or private, trading pools. The US securities and exchange commission has been running an inquiry for the past year. Central bankers have been fretting about ultra-fast computer trading since the \"flash crash\" on Wall Street in March 2010 when the Dow Jones industrial average suddenly plunged 9% and then recovered in minutes. In short, the warning lights for operators of dark pools should have been written in neon. If Barclays has slipped up, it's a question of competence. As ever in banking, good intentions are one thing, good behaviour is what matters. Lawyers spur police to act over Wonga Well done, the Law Society, which seems to have played the critical role in ensuring that the police will consider a criminal investigation of Wonga, the payday lender that sent letters to customers in arrears from non-existent law firms threatening legal action. Wonga this week agreed to pay \u00a32.6m compensation for its actions between 2008 and 2010. But the curiosity was why the Financial Conduct Authority, which agreed the settlement with the company, had not formally asked the police to investigate. The financial regulator was reluctant even to confirm it passed over files. The Law Society's call for a criminal investigation appears to have made the difference. City of London Police said on Friday it \"will reassess whether a criminal investigation is now appropriate\" having previously left matters in the hands of the FCA. Quite right. The desire to get compensation quickly to customers should not prevent a police investigation.",

Although branches are to close, more than 400 are to be upgraded to include iPads and free Wi-Fi \u2013 an approach that rivals such as Barclays are already adopting.

A reminder of the key points: Tesco has been urged to start paying the living wage to its staff, during a bruising annual general meeting with shareholders in London today. ShareAction handed over a petition calling on Tesco to embrace the living wage, and an 11-year old boy asked the board whether they'd make the move by the time he reached the labour force. In response, chairman Sir Richard Broadbent said Tesco wasn't 'deaf' to concerns, but a argued that Tesco's benefits help to push wages over the \u00a37.65 per hour mark. ShareAction isn't convinced, but is pleased that Tesco will meet with them to discuss the issue. Shareholders also criticised the poor performance of Tesco's shares, its failure to police disabled parking bays, the quality of its plastic bags and fruit. Chief executive Philip Clarke, under pressure to improve Tesco's fortunes, insisted that he had the right strategy to turn the company around, despite competition discount supermarkets and online retailers (details here). Clarke also resisted criticising his predecessor, Sir Terry Leahy, whose legacy looks less shining than three years ago. Leahy didn't get off scot-free either; blasted for being \"paid millions for losing billions\", through Tesco's failed push into the US. Full coverage of the AGM starts here. In other news today: We have confirmation that Britain's economy grew by a healthy 0.8% in the first three months of the year, driven by business investment. Analysts say it shows the UK is 'firing on all cylinders' And the UK current account deficit has narrowed, but remains quite wide. Eurozone confidence has fallen unexpectedly And Mark Carney has indicated that UK interest rates will only rise to around 2.5% in three years. Meanwhile in Brussels, European Union leaders have agreed that countries who push on with structural reforms should be given more time to bring their debt levels into line. It not the end of the fiscal rules, of course, but it looks like a win for those - such as Italian PM Matteo Renzi \u2013 who argue that Europe must give growth a higher priority. However, we'll have to see how much flexibility it actually gives. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering all the action at the EU summit, here: Here's Reuters news story about the events at Tesco's AGM: Under-fire Tesco management plead for patience Tesco management pleaded with shareholders to remain patient at a heated annual meeting on Friday, saying the \"radical\" changes they were making could not fix Britain's biggest retailer overnight. With shares trading at close to six-year lows, Chairman Richard Broadbent accepted that the company was not doing well enough but said it was investing for the long-term. Chief Executive Philip Clarke described the changes he was making as the \"most radical for a generation\". \"The board is aware that the share price has been poor over the last year,\" Chairman Broadbent told a packed meeting of investors in central London. \"You and we want to see a better performance.\"Shares in Tesco, the world's third largest retailer after Wal-Mart and Carrefour, have lost 23% in the last 11 months, giving the firm a market valuation of \u20ac23bn. The group, which has dominated the British high street for decades, in April reported a 6% fall in annual group trading profit, a second straight year of decline, and earlier this month recorded its worst quarterly UK sales drop in 40 years.\" Once you have lost your reputation, it's very difficult to get it back,\" one independent shareholder told the meeting, adding that they no longer shopped at Tesco as much as before. The continued poor performance has raised questions over Clarke's strategy to counter the challenges of a rapidly-changing grocery industry. \"Seeking to run the business defensively for short term gain would be wrong,\" Broadbent tried to explain. Clarke is two years into a multi-billion pound turnaround plan for Tesco's British business which contributes two-thirds of sales and profit for the group. He has invested in store refits, staff, product ranges and online services, has cut prices and dropped an industry leading profit margin target. Here's another photo of the protest outside Tesco's AGM, held by drivers who used to work on the Tesco distribution contract in Doncaster They claim that they were unfairly dismissed, and that haulage firm Eddie Stobart and Tesco had agreed to make 184 drivers redundant before the workers had been consulted. Their case is before an employment tribunal. Amy from ShareAction has collared Phil Clarke, and has been pushing Tesco's CEO to start paying the living wage to all staff. Those Tesco investors who haven't been lured by the free food are now voting on the various resolutions... The AGM has turned quite tetchy at the end, with one shareholder accusing Phil Clarke of being 'delusional' about the progress made on his watch (Clarke took over three years ago) Another is grumbling that he wants his lunch. So the board have ended the Q&amp;A and moved onto the voting.... ShareAction, the group which had protested outside the QE2 centre, has now handed over the petition calling on Tesco to offer the living wage to staff. They're not impressed by Broadbent's claim that staff do actually receive at least \u00a37.65 per hour once benefits are added. Amy, their representative, points out that while the perks offered to Tesco staff are welcome they can't actually be used to pay the rent. Brilliant! An eleven year-old boy named Lucas has asked Tesco why it doesn't offer the living wage (of \u00a37.65 an hour) to all staff. Lucas asks whether Tesco will pay living wage before he starts work -- putting the board firmly on the spot. The chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, replies that Tesco staff do actually receive more than the living wage when all benefits are included (such as their 10% discount). We're not \"deaf\" to the campaign to make us pay more, though, he adds. John Farmer also asked why Tesco's credit rating has fallen so much, to within two notches of the junk rating. In response, Tesco's chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, tells Farmer that all retailers are finding conditions tough. He also says that Laurie McIlwee chose to leave, and insists that Sir Terry's Leahy's legacy is being build on. Small shareholder John Farmer, who quite possibly has attended more AGMs than anyone else in Britain, is now asking Tesco's board a few pointed questions. Farmer says the Tesco board has failed to capitalise on the legacy left by Sir Terry Leahy, but also accuses it of \"monumental incompetence\" in America (see 11.58am for details). Farmer also demands to know whether outgoing finance director Laurie McIlwee jumped or was pushed out of the company. The chairman is trying to get a word in edgeways.... Fidgiting breaks out during a long answer to a question about how Tesco is performing in South East Asia (it's the market leader, don'tya know) ShareAction, the lobby group, are still waiting to ask Tesco whether it will pay the living wage to its staff: A range of complaints are being aired -- from the quality of Tesco's plastic bags to the limited range of kosher and lactose intolerant products on offer, via its failure to police its disabled parking bays to prevent abuse. On the last point, Philip Clarke says people need to show more consideration to others: The calibre of questions has improved, thanks to a shareholder from Germany who asks about differing pay rates paid to Tesco top brass. And no annual general meeting is complete without AGM veteran John Farmer - he's been spied, but hasn't got to a microphone yet... As if Tesco didn't have enough problems, it's now being pushed to match Waitrose's offer of free tea and coffee to loyalty card holders. One shareholder spends several minutes running through the different levels of service at Tesco stores around the country; she's not too impressed either. Nice summary of the scene at Tesco's AGM from retail reporter Simon Neville, no longer of this parish. I'm going to need a new refrigeration system myself if the quality of questions doesn't improve..... Another shareholder is taking Tesco to task about.....the quality of its fruit section The current board aren't getting off lightly -- they've been criticised for taking home 'million' of pounds despite Tesco's poor share performance (down 13% in the last year) Another Tesco shareholder reminds the throng that Phil Clarke's predecessor, Sir Terry Leahy, blundered by trying to crack the US market. The ill-fated Fresh &amp; Easy chain, estimated to have cost Tesco \u00a32bn, was put into bankruptcy last October. Tesco has also been handed a petition with 32,000 signatures, calling on the supermarket chain to start paying the living wage, of \u00a37.65 per hour, to its staff. I don't remember Madonna being a hit on the high street. You can always rely on Britain's army of small investors to speak unvarnished truth to City bosses: Without losing sight of smaller details: Now it's time for Tesco's shareholders to have their say.... Tesco's problems lie in its big stores, Clarke points out, rather than in its web shopping and smaller convenience stores. He tries to calm investor concerns by selling them that Tesco's new store format is delivering results: Tesco has learned over the last two years that we need to improve our performance, Clarke adds: Now Tesco's CEO, Philip Clarke, is on his feet at the AGM. Clarke, under pressure given Tesco's troubles, begins with a nod to the company's previous bosses: Clarke then says he's been \"eagerly\" waiting for the chance to tell investors about the challenges the company faces And he reels off a series of threats -- including the recession, the internet, and the rise of discount supermarket chains. Tesco is defending its turnaround strategy, saying that it's better to sacrifice some sales in the short term if it leads to better long-term prospects. But Sir Richard Broadbent also concedes that Britain's largest supermarket needs to improve (it recently suffered its biggest drop in sales in decades) Britain's largest supermarket is face to face with its shareholders, as the Tesco AGM begins. Tesco chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, speaks first -- blaming tough market conditions for the company's weak share price performance over the last year. Broadbent also argues that Tesco can't simply indulge in a massive price war -- that would be \"a strategy for long-term decline\", he insists. Back to this morning's UK growth data.... and Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, says the economy is moving from balanced recovery to expansion. Beck says: \u201cThe foundations of growth in consumer spending are looking a bit firmer. For the first time in almost a year, GDP increased without the need for households to save a smaller proportion of their incomes. The household saving ratio in Q1 rose a touch, against widespread expectations that it would see another quarterly drop. And there was good news on rebalancing. Investment is playing an increasingly important role in driving growth, with capital spending in Q1 growing at its fastest rate since 2007. He is also encouraged that Britain's current account deficit has fallen (although not by a lot, as explained here): \u201cThere were also signs of an easing in imbalances in the UK\u2019s overseas position. The current account deficit narrowed in Q1, although it still remains very large by historical standards, and net trade contributed to growth. The deficit in investment income, which has been largely responsible for the ballooning current account deficit in recent quarters, saw a welcome fall. Overall it looks like the UK growth engine is now firing on all cylinders.\u201d Our retail correspondent Zoe Wood is tweeting from the Tesco AGM: Tesco shareholders are gathering at The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in Westminster, for today's annual general meeting. And they're not alone -- a group of former drivers, who used to work on the Tesco distribution contract in Doncaster, are protesting outside the AGM. They claim they were unfairly dismissed by the company, and have taken their case to court. Unite national officer Adrian Jones explains: \u201cToday\u2019s demo is designed to drive home to Tesco\u2019s shareholders what the company has unfairly done to our members, so the shareholders know that the company\u2019s reputation will suffer as a result.\u201d This is disappointing -- confidence in the eurozone has fallen this month. Firms and consumers are fretting about the weakness of the recovery at home, and rising geopolitical tensions abroad. The European Commission's indicator of economic sentiment in the eurozone fell by 0.6 points to 102.0. Not a major move, but economists had hoped for a rise. The wider EU measure slipped by just 0.1 point to 106.4, helped by a jump in confidence in the UK and Poland. The EC reports: Amongst the largest euro area economies, the ESI eased in Germany (-1.3), France (-1.2) and Italy (-1.0), while it increased in the Netherlands (+0.7) and, more significantly, in Spain (+2.2). Worth highlighting is the 4.6 points rise in Greece, bringing its ESI above the long-term average for the first time since August 2008. While confidence in Europe's service sector rose, it fell among industry, construction and financial service firms, and among eurozone consumers. Chris Williamson of data firm Markit is encouraged that UK business investment has risen by 10% compared to a year ago; it bodes well for growth through 2014. Despite growing solidly in the last quarter, Britain hasn't made much progress in improving its balance of payments with the rest of the world. The UK ran a current account deficit of \u00a318.5bn in the first quarter of this year - or 4.4% of national output. That's better than the \u00a323.5bn recorded in Q4 2013, but the broader picture is that there's been disappointingly little progress since the recovery began. The end of an era is looming in Kent. Model maker Hornby is closing its warehouse on the South Coast, in a move that could see it leave its historic home. Sean Farrell has the story: Hornby to close warehouse in Kent Oh, and you can see the data here. The ONS also revised up its estimate for UK manufacturing growth, to +1.5% (from +1.4% before). This is the largest increase in manufacturing output since the second quarter of 2010. That may suggest the UK economy is rebalancing....but still, Services is the only part of the economy that's larger than before the financial crisis. So, why wasn't the UK growth rate for the last quarter revised higher, as some economists had expected given strong reports from the construction sector? Well,the ONS did indeed revise its estimate for construction output to +1.5%, a big jump on the +0.6% first estimated. But it also trimmed its estimate for growth in the service sector to +0.8%, from +0.9%. And given the size of the the UK service sector, the two changes cancelled each other out. And here's another chart from today's GDP report, showing how slow the UK recovery has been compared to previous downturns: The UK economy was 0.6% away from its pre-crisis peak at the end of the last quarter, the ONS says. That means that it's likely to finally break through that level in the current quarter Here's some more points from the UK growth report: The households\u2019 saving ratio was estimated to be 4.9% in Q1 2014. Real households\u2019 disposable income fell by 0.2% between Q4 2013 and Q1 2014. Here's an encouraging fact in the growth data - UK firms invested more than previously thought in the first three months of 2014, making a big contribution to growth. The ONS reports that business investment rose by 5.0% in the quarter, up from a previous estimate of 2.7%. That means it was responsible for 0.4% of growth, or half the total expansion. JUST: The UK economy grew at 0.8% in the first three months of 2014, the Office for National Statistics reports. That's in line with the previous estimate. But the annual growth over the rate has been revised down a little, to +3.0 from +3.1%. Details and reaction to follow... Nearly time for the UK growth data... Upbeat news from Italy, where factory owners report that they are more optimist than at any time since the early days of the eurozone crisis. Business morale has risen to a three year high, statistics body ISTAT reported, reaching 100.0 on its monthly index. That's the strongest reading since June 2011 -- just before Italy fell into recession. Jeremy Cook of World First reckons the UK Office for National Statistics may revise up its estimate for UK growth in January-March (from 0.8%), in 30 minutes time. He says: UK GDP has the very real chance of being revised higher this morning following strong March surveys in construction and services output. We think that GDP will move to 0.9% on the quarter \u2013 a far cry from the numbers seen in France, Germany or the US. Here's Reuters take on Mark Carney's appearance on the Today programme: Britain's economy is still relatively vulnerable, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Friday, citing high levels of household debt. \"This is an economy that's just come off its worst recession in modern history, that still is relatively vulnerable,\" Carney told BBC radio. \"Households ... still have a lot of debt relative to their income, so there can be some expansion in borrowing, some movement in the housing market, but there shouldn't be too much.\" Carney added that the time will come to raise interest rates, but that they will rise in a limited and gradual fashion. Joshua Raymond, analyst at City Index, predicts that Tesco will avoid a shareholder revolt today, but will probably face tough questions from investors given its underperformance in recent quarters: Here's some instant reaction to Mark Carney's interview on Radio 4 this morning: Bank of England governor Mark Carney just dropped a hint that UK interest rates could be around 2.5% in three year's time (from their record low of 0.5% today). Carney was being interviewed on Radio 4's Today Programme, and told the nation that interest rates could start rising this year, or alternatively not until 2015 (indeed....). But that won't spark a surge in borrowing costs, he suggests. Instead, the governor indicated interest rates will reach their \"new normal\" in the first quarter of 2017, which could be just half the historical average of 5%. Carney also repeated his message that borrowing costs will rise in a \"limited and gradual\" fashion. In other words, people shouldn't worry too much about when the first rate rise comes, but should calculate how they'd cope as monetary policy returns to normal levels. We also have confirmation that France's economy stagnated in the first three months of this year. Statistics bosy INSEE reported that France's GDP \"held steady\" (that's one way of putting it) in January-March period. This confirms the earlier estimate of French GDP - today's report also shows that domestic demand fell in Q1 2014, prompting companies to expand their inventories. The report also shows France's trade position deteriorated during the quarter. Imports rose by 1%, while exports only increased by +0.6%. Zero growth is not great -- but it does compare favourably to the US, which shrank by around 0.7% (or 2.9% on an annualised basis) during Q1 (bad weather was partly to blame) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, business and the eurozone. Two events coming up on an otherwise quiet-ish Friday. At 9.30am the Office for National Statistics publishes its latest assessment of the UK economy in the first quarter of 2014. It might revise GDP even higher than the 0.8% growth previously estimated, which would further cement Britain's position as the fastest growing G7 member this year. We'll also be watching supermarket giant Tesco, which is holding its annual general meeting with shareholders today. The AGM starts at 11am, and could be lively, given Tesco just suffered its worst quarter's trading in decades. Shareholders may also quiz CEO Philip Clarke about the 310 separate, undeveloped sites across the UK which Tesco owns, but hasn't developed. Enough to build 15,000 new homes, as a Guardian investigation has found: Revealed: Tesco hoarding land that could build 15,000 homes As ever, please flag up anything important you've seen in your patch in the comments below (apologies for the late start too, two small technical glitches here)",

    "webTitle": "Mark Carney's first year as Bank of England governor: the verdicts are in", 
    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "The economic data has been steadily improving since his arrival, but Carney has also been criticised for the poor execution of forward guidance", 
      "body": "<p>When Mark Carney arrived for his first day as Bank of England governor on 1 July 2013, he carried with him the burden of high expectation. Wooed by George Osborne and an \u00a3874,000 pay package, the former Goldman Sachs executive and Bank of Canada governor was hailed as the rock star of central banking. Osborne described him as \"the outstanding central banker of his generation\".</p> <p>His task was huge. It included, among other things, the shakeup of a 319-year-old institution, oversight of a raft of unprecedented powers, normalisation of monetary policy after the crisis response, and responsibility for putting the UK's economic recovery on a sustainable footing.</p> <p>The economic data has been steadily improving since Carney got the keys to Threadneedle Street, but the Bank's 120th governor has received criticism for the poor execution of his flagship forward guidance policy, and for sending mixed signals on the likely timing of the first interest rate rise.</p> <p>Below, a panel of experts give their verdicts on how Carney has done in his first year in the job.</p> <h2>Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC and former MPC member</h2> <p>It has been an eventful first year. On the plus side, the UK economy has picked up, and inflation has come down. The British economy now looks set to be the strongest growing of the G7 economies this year. Unemployment is down to just over 6.5%, from nearly 8% when the new governor took over. And the housing market has come back to life as the economy has rebounded.</p> <p>But on the policy front, things have gone less well. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is now on the third iteration of its attempt to provide \"forward guidance\". There is still a lack of clarity about the circumstances in which the Bank would be prepared to raise interest rates, and how quickly it would do so.</p> <p>When Mark Carney took over at the Bank of England, the big challenge for his governorship was to return interest rates to more normal levels without undermining the UK's economic recovery. A year on, that major challenge still lies ahead. Of course, it is not just a challenge for Mark Carney but for his nine-member MPC too. With interest rates set to rise over the next six to 12 months, we will know much more about how they are getting on this time next year.</p> <h2>Pat McFadden, Labour MP and member of the Treasury select committee</h2> <p>The Bank of England's policy of forward guidance on interest rates has left some people scratching their heads.</p> <p>First it was expected that rates would not rise until 2016, possibly even later. Soon, the guidance was revised and markets expected a rise in 2015. After the Mansion House speech it looked like later this year. Finally at the Treasury select committee last week the talk was of spare capacity still to be used up before any rate rise would happen.</p> <p>Forward guidance is supposed to give clarity on the future path of rate changes, but if the timing keeps bouncing around then that clarity becomes lost or at least damaged. And if the Bank is now saying it will simply judge things month by month on the available economic data, then that is what it has always done and one has to ask what forward guidance really amounts to.</p> <p>On the housing market the Bank has been given new powers to regulate lending. Its first use of these powers this week was tentative and more an insurance against a bigger bubble than a real attempt to restrain lending now. On this issue the governor has been right to point out that whatever the Bank of England can do on mortgage demand, it won't build a single house. The real answer to long term stability in Britain's housing market is to build more houses \u2013 and that's a job for government and house builders, not the Bank of England.</p> <h2>Fionnuala Earley, residential research director, Hamptons International<br></h2> <p>Looking at where the UK economy and housing market were when the governor took over shows the juggling he's had to do. A year ago economic growth was only just picking up but was unbalanced. The corporate sector was struggling, yet the housing market was gathering momentum, although its recovery was \u2013 and largely still is \u2013 split between London and the rest of the UK.</p> <p>Given limited tools, and a new regulatory setup, overall the governor has done a pretty good job for the housing market. Admittedly withdrawing the Funding for Lending Scheme for households did little, but it was trumped by the boost to sentiment from the introduction of Help to Buy. A small early rise in interest rates might have cooled demand in London, but probably not much given that most activity has been in higher price and income brackets. The real risk was that higher mortgage payments could have pushed existing homeowners into distressed selling, which would have halted any recovery and dashed confidence.</p> <p>Choosing to focus on macro prudential rules via the mortgage market review and the Financial Policy Committee recommendations on loan-to-income and interest rate tests has the benefit of constraining the most vulnerable lending first, while allowing other activity to continue to recover. Sending messages about the housing market being at the top of the list of concerns also helps to dampen expectations \u2013 a crucial element of housing market bubbles. It's been better that the governor has barked about regulations and risk rather than used interest rate teeth.</p> <h2>Sir Martin Sorrell, founder and chief executive of WPP</h2> <p>I'd give him an A or A-minus.</p> <p>Clearly there have been concerns about inconsistencies in his communications. The problem is that you can't deliver one message to one audience and say something different to another. Nowadays everybody sees and hears everything. But overall he has been a good communicator and seems relatively at ease with that aspect of the role.</p> <p>More importantly, the UK economy is certainly in better shape.</p> <p>This is good news for the government as it faces an election next year, and I doubt the economic situation is going to get any worse in the short term, so the problems with forward guidance and Mansion House speeches and grillings by the Treasury select committee recede in importance.</p> <p>That said, conditions do change and forward guidance is a pretty perilous thing to do, given the volatility in markets and the microscopic examination of anything the governor says or does.</p> <p>It appears that interest rates are likely to stay low for longer than expected and the new normal, as the governor has pointed out, is likely to be around 2.5% rather than 5%. To us, the reason seems to be the still-considerable conservatism, particularly post-Lehman, that companies exhibit.

      "bodyText": "When Mark Carney arrived for his first day as Bank of England governor on 1 July 2013, he carried with him the burden of high expectation. Wooed by George Osborne and an \u00a3874,000 pay package, the former Goldman Sachs executive and Bank of Canada governor was hailed as the rock star of central banking. Osborne described him as \"the outstanding central banker of his generation\". His task was huge. It included, among other things, the shakeup of a 319-year-old institution, oversight of a raft of unprecedented powers, normalisation of monetary policy after the crisis response, and responsibility for putting the UK's economic recovery on a sustainable footing. The economic data has been steadily improving since Carney got the keys to Threadneedle Street, but the Bank's 120th governor has received criticism for the poor execution of his flagship forward guidance policy, and for sending mixed signals on the likely timing of the first interest rate rise. Below, a panel of experts give their verdicts on how Carney has done in his first year in the job. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC and former MPC member It has been an eventful first year. On the plus side, the UK economy has picked up, and inflation has come down. The British economy now looks set to be the strongest growing of the G7 economies this year. Unemployment is down to just over 6.5%, from nearly 8% when the new governor took over. And the housing market has come back to life as the economy has rebounded. But on the policy front, things have gone less well. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is now on the third iteration of its attempt to provide \"forward guidance\". There is still a lack of clarity about the circumstances in which the Bank would be prepared to raise interest rates, and how quickly it would do so. When Mark Carney took over at the Bank of England, the big challenge for his governorship was to return interest rates to more normal levels without undermining the UK's economic recovery. A year on, that major challenge still lies ahead. Of course, it is not just a challenge for Mark Carney but for his nine-member MPC too. With interest rates set to rise over the next six to 12 months, we will know much more about how they are getting on this time next year. Pat McFadden, Labour MP and member of the Treasury select committee The Bank of England's policy of forward guidance on interest rates has left some people scratching their heads. First it was expected that rates would not rise until 2016, possibly even later. Soon, the guidance was revised and markets expected a rise in 2015. After the Mansion House speech it looked like later this year. Finally at the Treasury select committee last week the talk was of spare capacity still to be used up before any rate rise would happen. Forward guidance is supposed to give clarity on the future path of rate changes, but if the timing keeps bouncing around then that clarity becomes lost or at least damaged. And if the Bank is now saying it will simply judge things month by month on the available economic data, then that is what it has always done and one has to ask what forward guidance really amounts to. On the housing market the Bank has been given new powers to regulate lending. Its first use of these powers this week was tentative and more an insurance against a bigger bubble than a real attempt to restrain lending now. On this issue the governor has been right to point out that whatever the Bank of England can do on mortgage demand, it won't build a single house. The real answer to long term stability in Britain's housing market is to build more houses \u2013 and that's a job for government and house builders, not the Bank of England. Fionnuala Earley, residential research director, Hamptons International Looking at where the UK economy and housing market were when the governor took over shows the juggling he's had to do. A year ago economic growth was only just picking up but was unbalanced. The corporate sector was struggling, yet the housing market was gathering momentum, although its recovery was \u2013 and largely still is \u2013 split between London and the rest of the UK. Given limited tools, and a new regulatory setup, overall the governor has done a pretty good job for the housing market. Admittedly withdrawing the Funding for Lending Scheme for households did little, but it was trumped by the boost to sentiment from the introduction of Help to Buy. A small early rise in interest rates might have cooled demand in London, but probably not much given that most activity has been in higher price and income brackets. The real risk was that higher mortgage payments could have pushed existing homeowners into distressed selling, which would have halted any recovery and dashed confidence. Choosing to focus on macro prudential rules via the mortgage market review and the Financial Policy Committee recommendations on loan-to-income and interest rate tests has the benefit of constraining the most vulnerable lending first, while allowing other activity to continue to recover. Sending messages about the housing market being at the top of the list of concerns also helps to dampen expectations \u2013 a crucial element of housing market bubbles. It's been better that the governor has barked about regulations and risk rather than used interest rate teeth. Sir Martin Sorrell, founder and chief executive of WPP I'd give him an A or A-minus. Clearly there have been concerns about inconsistencies in his communications. The problem is that you can't deliver one message to one audience and say something different to another. Nowadays everybody sees and hears everything. But overall he has been a good communicator and seems relatively at ease with that aspect of the role. More importantly, the UK economy is certainly in better shape. This is good news for the government as it faces an election next year, and I doubt the economic situation is going to get any worse in the short term, so the problems with forward guidance and Mansion House speeches and grillings by the Treasury select committee recede in importance. That said, conditions do change and forward guidance is a pretty perilous thing to do, given the volatility in markets and the microscopic examination of anything the governor says or does. It appears that interest rates are likely to stay low for longer than expected and the new normal, as the governor has pointed out, is likely to be around 2.5% rather than 5%. To us, the reason seems to be the still-considerable conservatism, particularly post-Lehman, that companies exhibit. To achieve greater growth, there has to be less uncertainty. Dr Gerard Lyons, chief economic adviser to Boris Johnson, mayor of London Mark Carney has only now reached the end of his honeymoon period, even though he has been there a year. Why? The key change has not just been the new man at the top but the considerable new powers given to the Bank. Carney's high point was the clear message he sent on interest rates when he came in \u2013 that rates did not need to increase immediately, would rise gradually and peak low. Recently his message has been more couched, as the UK needs to tread carefully on rates as recovery is too much driven by housing and debt. He has made considerable organisational and people changes. Let's hope the newcomers are not all yes people and that his new setup reaches out beyond the Bank, understands the City, forecasts the economy properly and gets to grips with credit creation. The governor must ensure the new areas work together: micro and macroprudential and traditional monetary policy. For Mark Carney the real test is to come and is to maximise the powers at the Bank's disposal in the face of possible public and political unease. John Cridland, CBI director general The governor's end of year report card is positive. The innovations in UK monetary policy he has spearheaded \u2013 in the form of forward guidance \u2013 have provided certainty to businesses, households and financial markets. His time as governor has seen solid growth in the UK, which is set to continue. We expect economic growth to strengthen this year, to 3%, and to remain strong at 2.7% next year. He has also presided over a beefing up of the Bank of England's financial stability role, making it one of the most powerful central banks in the world, and ensuring effective coordination between monetary and macroprudential policy. Housing remains a critical issue up and down the country, and the governor has responded well to concerns about its impact on financial stability. As the old saying goes though, prevention is better than cure. We need to be clear that the only real long-term answer to tackling rising house prices is to take bold action to increase the supply of new homes. What's important now is that any changes to monetary policy are clearly signposted and communicated to give businesses certainty as they invest to grow our economy.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hornby is closing the warehouse at its Margate headquarters in a move that could see the model railway maker leave its historic site on the Kent coast entirely. Announcing an annual loss of \u00a34.5m, the maker of model trains, Airfix kits and Corgi cars said it would transfer its warehouse to an industrial estate at Hersden, 11 miles from Margate. The warehouse's 25 permanent staff will join an outsourced logistics provider with no loss of jobs. Hornby made its products at the site until the 1990s, when it transferred manufacturing to Asia and the old factory became a warehouse. But the site is run down and struggles to handle the big lorries used in modern deliveries. Hornby is understood to be considering moving the rest of its operations and 150 employees from Margate, including sales and administration and the company's visitor centre, which plays host to thousands of enthusiasts every year. Richard Ames, Hornby's new chief executive, said: \"The facility in Margate that has housed the company's UK stock since manufacturing started to move to China in the late 1990s, has been an area of concern for some time. \"This has concluded with a decision to move to a new, third-party warehouse, run by an independent logistics specialist, DS Logistics. This is a key decision for the company, and one not taken lightly, given the history and tradition of the current site.\" The site opened 60 years ago as a new factory for Hornby's rival, Tri-ang Railways, and became Hornby's home when Tri-Ang's owner, Lines Brothers, bought Hornby's parent, Meccano Ltd, and merged the model rail brands under the banner Tri-Ang Hornby. Hornby's departure from Margate would be a blow to the seaside town, which is trying to reverse decades of decay since Britons began jetting to hotter countries for their holidays. The Turner art gallery has attracted visitors and a new creative scene, but Hornby remains a significant private sector employer. Hornby's loss for the year ended 31 March widened to \u00a34.5m from \u00a32.5m a year before. The company was hit by falling sales as a result of manufacturing problems as well as the closure of Modelzone, the retailer where Hornby had concessions, and a \u00a31m fall in the value of unused foreign currency it had bought to pay suppliers. Ames, who joined two months ago, said trading in the current year had brought no nasty surprises and that he was confident the company could be turned around. Hornby's shares rose 2.6% to 78.5p. Hornby has suffered recurring problems with the same manufacturer of its model railways since 2010 and has been forced to issue a string of profit warnings as a result. It has extricated itself from the contract and Ames has pledged to improve production. Ames said the supply problems had damaged Hornby's relationships with specialist retailers and customers. He has launched a communication drive to reconnect with enthusiasts through the company's website, social media and trade magazines. \"This is an extremely important issue, as these are the true fans of the brands. It is key that we do not take these fans for granted. New colleagues, now working in the social media team, are focused on providing daily updates and interactions with fans and sharing the information that drives the passion for collecting, modelling and driving our products.\" The website has been revamped and now features a blog by Simon Kohler, a company veteran of 35 years who was Hornby's railway guru until he retired this year.",

      "bodyText": "The corporate regulator has called on the financial planning industry to work to restore consumers\u2019 trust as the government played down the prospect of a royal commission into misconduct at Commonwealth Bank. A parliamentary committee report strongly criticised the bank and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic), saying the issue was so serious it warranted the establishment of an independent judicial inquiry or royal commission with the power to compel witnesses to give evidence and produce documents. The Senate\u2019s economic references committee accused Asic of missing or ignoring persistent signs of wrongdoing, characterising it as a \u201ctimid, hesitant regulator\u201d that was too ready to uncritically accept assurances of a large institution that there were no grounds for intervention.

Bushby also disagreed with the call for a further inquiry, saying a royal commission was a \"fact-finding mission\" and would come at a significant cost to taxpayers yet the issues to be examined had already been extensively reviewed. The government, which has already launched royal commissions into the former government\u2019s home insulation scheme and trade union corruption claims, is unlikely to heed the committee\u2019s call for another. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said Bushby had made a \u201cvery persuasive argument that yet another inquiry might not be the best way forward\u201d. \"I do think that the bank needs to provide a proper response to the allegations that have been raised,\" Cormann told the ABC. He had received the committee's report and was carefully considering its 61 recommendations before making a \u201cfull response\u201d. The recommendations included a shift towards a \u201cuser pays\u201d model for Asic funding and called for Asic to conduct surveillance \"of other financial advice businesses that have recently been a source of concern, such as Macquarie Private Wealth\". It suggested the establishment by Asic of a pool of approved independent experts to provide advice when concerns emerge about a poor compliance culture in a particular company. The government should also expand whistleblower protections and consider increasing penalties for financial services licensees that failed to lodge reports of significant breaches to Asic within the required time, the committee said. Tony Abbott called the misconduct described in the report \u201cterrible\u201d but said the government already had launched an inquiry into the financial system. \u201cObviously some terrible things happened and its good that the parliamentary committee inquiry into this has been able to expose some of the problems,\u201d the prime minister said on Friday. \u201cWe do have a inquiry into financial governance going on now and we want to ensure that investors are as safe as they can be in a market economy.\u201d The financial system inquiry is chaired by David Murray, who was the chief executive of the Commonwealth Bank between 1992 and 2005. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said the government should \"immediately consult with Asic and bring forward legislation that strengthens Australia's civil and criminal penalties which at minimum should bring them into line with global benchmarks\". The Senate report came as the government pursued controversial changes to Labor's Future of Financial Advice laws that the opposition argued would water down consumer protections. The opposition treasury spokesman, Chris Bowen, said: \"This report should serve as a warning to the government to drop their outrageous watering down of the Future of Financial Advice reforms.\" As part of its work, the committee examined misconduct that occurred between 2006 and 2010 by financial planners and other staff at CFPL, part of the Commonwealth Bank. The report, tabled in the Senate, said advisers \"deliberately neglected their duties and placed their personal interests far above the interests of their clients\". \"The assets of clients with conservative risk positions, such as retirees, were allocated into high-risk products without their knowledge to the financial benefit of the adviser, who received significant bonuses and recognition within CFPL as a 'high performer',\" the report said. \"There was forgery and dishonest concealment of material facts.

      "bodyText": "The government has called on the Commonwealth Bank to provide a \"proper response\" to allegations of misconduct by financial planners, but played down the prospects of a royal commission. \"I do think that the bank needs to provide a proper response to the allegations that have been raised,\" Mathias Cormann said, after a parliamentary report on Thursday called for a commission to investigate the bank's handling of misconduct by financial planners. But Cormann also pointed out that the committee's call was not unanimous, with Liberal senator David Bushby dissenting. \"He did make a very persuasive argument that yet another inquiry might not be the best way forward,\" Cormann said. Tony Abbott described the misconduct as \u201cterrible\u201d but said the government already had an inquiry into financial governance continuing. \u201cObviously some terrible things happened and its good that the parliamentary committee inquiry into this has been able to expose some of the problems,\u201d the prime minister said on Friday. \u201cWe do have a inquiry into financial governance going on now and we want to ensure that investors are as safe as they can be in a market economy.\u201d The Senate report came as the government pursues controversial changes to Labor's Future of Financial Advice laws that the opposition argues will water down consumer protections. Cormann said he had received the committee's report and was carefully considering its 61 recommendations. \"When I work through it, we'll make a full response,\" he told ABC radio on Friday. The committee's final report accused the Commonwealth Bank of deliberately playing down the seriousness and extent of problems within its financial planning section in an attempt to avoid Asic scrutiny, contain adverse publicity and minimise compensation payments. The report also contained scathing criticism of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic), accusing the corporate regulator of missing or ignoring persistent signs of wrongdoing. The economic references committee described Asic as a \"timid, hesitant regulator\" that was too ready to uncritically accept assurances of a large institution that there were no grounds for intervention. As part of its work, the committee examined misconduct that occurred between 2006 and 2010 by financial planners and other staff at Commonwealth Financial Planning Limited (CFPL), part of the Commonwealth Bank. The report, tabled in the Senate, said advisers \"deliberately neglected their duties and placed their personal interests far above the interests of their clients\". \"The assets of clients with conservative risk positions, such as retirees, were allocated into high-risk products without their knowledge to the financial benefit of the adviser, who received significant bonuses and recognition within CFPL as a 'high performer',\" the report said. \"There was forgery and dishonest concealment of material facts. Clients lost substantial amounts of their savings when the global financial crisis hit; the crisis was also used to explain away the poor performance of portfolios. Meanwhile, it is alleged that within CFPL there was a management conspiracy that, perversely, resulted in one of the most serious offenders, Mr Don Nguyen, being promoted.\" The committee, headed by the retiring Labor senator Mark Bishop, said both Asic and the bank seemed to place reports of fraud in the \"too-hard basket\"; the bank's compliance regime failed; and the regulator had been too slow in realising the seriousness of the problems and had not paid sufficient attention to whistleblowers. It outlined serious concerns about the Asic-backed compensation process for CFPL clients who had lost money because of adviser misconduct, and concluded that the bank's credibility was \"so compromised\" that it should lose responsibility for compensation payments. The committee said the situation was so serious that it warranted the establishment of an independent judicial inquiry or royal commission with the power to compel witnesses to give evidence and produce documents. It would examine the bank's actions \"and the allegations of a cover-up\", review compensation payments, and recommend any improvements to Asic and other regulation. The committee comprised three Labor senators \u2013 Bishop, Sam Dastyari and Louise Pratt \u2013 along with two Coalition senators, David Bushby and John Williams, and the independent senator Nick Xenophon. Bushby wrote a dissenting report in which he said he did not believe the majority report had \"got this balance right\" and noting that the Commonwealth Bank had already made compensation payments totalling $51m to 1,127 customers. Bushby said a royal commission was a \"fact-finding mission\" yet the issues to be examined had already been extensively reviewed. Williams, a Nationals MP, expressed his support for a further inquiry, saying he had received evidence of fraud, wrongdoing and forgery. \"A judicial inquiry or a royal commission would, I believe, clarify and even discover more evidence of wrongdoing,\" Williams told Sky News. \"I've said for three years we should have a royal commission into white-collar crime in Australia, right across the board \u2026 Even if only 10% of [allegations] I receive is correct there's a problem out there.\" The government had indicated changes to the Future of Financial Advice measures would be implemented through regulations, rather than legislation, to take effect on 1 July. The status of those measures remains unclear, with the Senate having risen on Thursday and being not due to return until next month. The government is not required to table the regulations until six parliamentary sitting days after they are registered. In a broader critique of Asic's performance, the committee said the regulator had limited powers and resources \"but even so appears to miss or ignore clear and persistent early warning signs of corporate wrongdoing or troubling trends that pose a risk to consumers\". Asic responded to the report by vowing to \"continue to do the best job we can with the resources we have\". The regulator said it had previously acknowledged it could have improved its actions in relation to CFPL, including communicating more effectively with whistleblowers. Asic said it was also taking steps to remedy the inconsistent treatment of customers in the compensation process. \"We also note some recommendations \u2013 such as registration of financial advisers, raising adviser standards, higher penalties and a user pays funding model \u2013 are issues Asic has suggested in its submission to the Financial System Inquiry,\u201d said the Asic chairman, Greg Medcraft. Other suggestions among the committee's 61 recommendations were the establishment by Asic of a pool of approved independent experts to provide advice when concerns emerge about a poor compliance culture in a particular company. The government should also expand whistleblower protections and consider increasing penalties for financial services licensees that failed to lodge reports of significant breaches to Asic within the required time, the committee said. It also called for Asic surveillance \"of other financial advice businesses that have recently been a source of concern, such as Macquarie Private Wealth\", and a shift towards a \"user pays\" model for Asic funding.",
