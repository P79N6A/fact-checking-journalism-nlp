      "bodyText": "Mario Draghi, the usually calm president of the European Central Bank, is fuming at the antics of London\u2019s banks as they try to minimise the effects of Brexit. In a move that mimics Donald Trump\u2019s America First campaign, Draghi has issued London\u2019s financial institutions \u2013 including the 450-odd foreign banks operating in the capital \u2013 a stern warning that unless they put euroland first, they won\u2019t be able to trade inside the 19-member currency bloc. His hackles were raised by submissions from many of the largest financial institutions that show they planned to rely on little more than brass-plate operations in Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Dublin. As chief banking supervisor, the ECB says this is not good enough. The main bone of contention is the management of risk. Officials say that if banks are lending to individuals and businesses in the eurozone, they must manage that risk from inside the region and not London. Draghi knows that when the next crash comes, regulators need to call senior officials within their jurisdiction and not a clerk who occasionally polishes the sign on the door. So it\u2019s clear he is serious, which means the banks must revise their \u201cBrexit-related relocation plans\u201d to include \u201cpermanent local trading capabilities and local risk committees\u201d with commensurate numbers of staff and managers. We\u2019ve seen a few estimates of finance jobs going to the continent post-Brexit. The Bank of England believes 75,000 is a reasonable guess. Now that Draghi is cracking the whip, prepare to see that number rise. Productivity pressures The Brexit effect could make British companies more productive and push up wage rates. Or it could have the opposite effect. That was the conclusion of Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent, as he looked forward to the next 18 months of David Davis and Michel Barnier arm wrestling in Brussels. The latest employment figures show that the first fall since 2015 in employment triggered an increase in productivity. It is a welcome relief that, in crude terms, the UK was more efficient at producing goods and services in the three months to September when productivity earlier this year was falling. It is also a neat trick that this happened with unemployment dropping to 1.42 million. But it\u2019s likely the average has increased simply in response to a fall in the number of low-level service industry jobs, mainly in the leisure sector, that depress productivity. A boom in skilled manufacturing jobs based on long-term investment as a route to higher productivity continues to elude the UK. Sick business? The care home business Four Seasons blames its financial woes on tight-fisted local authorities, which pay for most of its residents, and an exodus of migrant workers. As excuses go, they are a bit thin. Local authorities have paid buttons to care providers for decades and what they pay for, and what they refuse to subsidise, is well known and can be planned for. As for the loss of migrants, the UK\u2019s population is still growing and plenty of the incomers are from the continent. If Four Seasons cannot hang on to staff it will be because working conditions are poor and the pay worse. To some extent that is related to local authority payments, but again the situation is predictable. So is the conclusion that Four Seasons management are poor at planning? That can hardly be the case when its owners hail from the world of private equity, which is famed for meticulous five-year plans that are frequently updated as circumstances change. The focus should be on a series of complex finance deals that have loaded the business with so much debt that interest payments are the biggest bill. Guy Hands, the private equity boss who runs the current owner, Terra Firma, denies he has profited from Four Seasons through loans charged at 15% interest. Even if that\u2019s true, and it seems unlikely, why would a local authority pay more than the minimum when the stated aim of the business is to maximise profits to pay interest on its debts that feed Hands\u2019 investors? It is a broken model and yet another area of the economy where the market doesn\u2019t work. The only remedy must be to consider social care as part of the health service and pay for it through a modest tax on everyone. Rather than play the dementia tax lottery, people who age well \u2013 without recourse to a residential or nursing home \u2013 should think themselves luckier than those who succumb to dementia or another debilitating illness. There is public support for a rise in council tax on expensive homes to increase funding. Better still is Andy Burnham\u2019s idea for a levy, which was decried as a death tax when first proposed ahead of the 2010 general election, but fairly grabs back a bit of each family\u2019s unearned gains from property price inflation.",

      "bodyText": "Continuing strength in the euro, a falling oil price and a decline in US markets, have combined to pull most European shares lower. On Wall Street, worries about a Chinese slowdown and concerns over the Republicans successfully implementing their tax plans were additional negative factors. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 41.81 points or 0.56% at a five week low of 7372.61 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.44% to 12,976.37 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.27% at 5301.25 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.62% to 22,158.88 But Spain\u2019s Ibex bucked the trend, up 0.24% at 10,013.9 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.19% to 718.80 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 87 points or 0.38%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Markets may be lower but could be supported at these levels. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says: Stocks are falling, volatility is on the up, China\u2019s economic growth appears to be weakening and we even have a military coup to deal with. On the face of it, the situation would be ripe for a big selloff in equity markets, but this is not 2008 or even 2015. Below the surface some sectors, such as utilities, are recovering, while in the UK and Europe markets are off their lows. It is options expiration week, and a look at positioning through put/call ratios suggests sentiment has become excessively bearish. Plus, Thanksgiving is on the horizon, and the week before this all-American holiday tends to be a good one. The bears can almost taste victory, but I suspect that 2017 will work its magic once again and the dip buyers will have their way. The concerns about a rise in US crude stocks last week proved well founded. They climbed by 1.85m barrels compared to earlier forecasts of a 2.2m drop. Gasoline stocks rose by 894,000 barrels as opposed to the expected 0.9m decline. Oil prices remained in the doldrums after report but at least recovered from their lows, with West Texas Intermediate now doen 0.46% at $55.24 a barrel. US markets remain in negative territory although the Dow Jones Industrial Average is off its worst levels, down 131 points or 0.5%. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The markets looked pretty bloody this Wednesday, with the euro once again the only real winner. With US investors already fretting about the Republican tax reforms \u2013 namely the party\u2019s ability to push them through after they failed so spectacularly on healthcare \u2013 a weak pair of inflation and retail sales readings didn\u2019t really do much to help matters. The former came in as expected at a measly 0.1% in October, down from 0.5% in September, while the latter arrived at a better than forecast, but still miserly, 0.2%. Neither figure substantially threatens a December rate hike from the Federal Reserve; however, the tendrils of doubt are never too far away, meaning the US markets could have done with something more robust to drive away the current gloom. Instead the Dow Jones is stuck with a 130 point fall, taking the index to a sub-23300, near 4-week nadir. The dollar wasn\u2019t much better; while it held flat against the pound, largely due to sterling\u2019s own inflation and wage growth issues, it shed 0.1% against the euro and 0.4% against the yen. Things were just as glum in Europe. The FTSE is down around 50 points thanks to its commodity stocks, and is trading at its worst price since the end of September, while the DAX, displeased at the euro\u2019s resilience, has shed nearly 120 points to hit a fresh 6 and a half week low. Back in the UK, and sales of used cars fell over the summer, according to the industry body. Julia Kollewe writes: The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said today that the used car market declined for a second quarter, with sales down 2.1% between July and September from a year ago. About 2.1m secondhand cars changed hands. Superminis are still popular, making up a third of sales. Along with SUVs they were the only categories to show growth. Silver remains the most popular used car colour, closely followed by black. Sales of hybrid and electric cars rose 17% to 25,196 units (electric cars alone urged 66.4%). While petrol sales fell 6.5%, demand for diesels rose 4.2% \u2013 in stark contrast to new diesels where sales have fallen sharply. After a bumper first quarter the market remains at record levels, with more than 6.3m buyers opting for a used car in the first nine months of this year, up 0.1% on the same period last year. Simon Benson, director of motoring services at used car website AA Cars, said:\u201cSales of used cars have suffered - but not nearly at the same rate as the new car market, which experienced a double digit decline last month. A lack of consumer confidence has rippled out across the market.\u201d The retail sales and inflation figures are likely to add more fuel to the fire in terms of a US rate rise next month, analysts believe. But there is some uncertainty as to the future trend of borrowing costs, especially with a new Fed chair for the new year and a change in the composition of the decision making panel. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: The recently released figures from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics show that while inflation is creeping up as anticipated, it appears reluctant to move through the gears. What this rising inflation will provide, however, is yet another tick on the checklist, as the Fed looks increasingly likely to raise interests rates next month. With a December rate rise already priced in by many analysts, the next question is whether Jerome Powell, President Trump\u2019s pick to be the next Fed chairman, continues current chair Janet Yellen\u2019s cautious approach to rate movements. ING economist James Smith said: A pick-up in core inflation and solid retail sales suggests investors may still be too cautious about the rate hike outlook for the next year. Falling core inflation has seen markets remain fairly cautious on the outlook for interest rates through much of this year. However, the latest data for October saw core CPI expectedly rise to 1.8% year on year, providing some tentative evidence that inflation may be finally starting to turn a corner. Headline CPI dipped back slightly to 2% as gasoline prices re-adjust following the hurricanes a couple of months ago. This rise in core CPI tallies with the latest above-consensus producer-price inflation data released yesterday, which saw core PPI hit a five-year high of 2.4%. Given the weaker dollar and higher energy prices, we are optimistic that inflationary pressures will continue to build as we head into next year. Likewise, we also expect wage growth to continue gradually picking up in 2018. There was some equally good news from today\u2019s retail sales data. The headline rate of growth was held back somewhat by falling gasoline prices. But 0.3% month on month growth in the control group (which excludes volatile items) suggest that consumers started the fourth quarter on a solid footing. This is one reason why we are looking for another near-3% GDP growth reading this quarter. All of this argues in favour of a December rate hike, but markets are still sceptical that we will get much more than one hike during next year. However, with the Fed broadening out the reasons for tightening policy - with references to loose financial conditions and rich asset valuations - we suspect investors are too cautious. There is also the annual rotation of regional Fed voters, which will see two hawks (Williams and Mester) take over the votes of two doves (Kashkari and Evans) in 2018. We expect two hikes next year. Earlier there was some US data, showing both retail sales and inflation on the rise, albeit a very small increase in the latter An increase in car purchases helped retail sales rise to a better than expected 0.2% in October, offsetting a decline in demand for building materials. Economists had forecast no change. Meanwhile the September figure was revised upwards from 1.6% to 1.9%. On the inflation front, consumer prices edged up 0.1% in October as a boost to oil prices from the hurricane-related disruptions to the Gulf Coast fell away. In September, the consumer price index had climbed 0.5%. The data - the inflation figures in particular - was seen as negative for the dollar. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said: Sellers immediately attacked the dollar on Wednesday after U.S. consumer prices marginally increased by 0.1% in October \u2013 the smallest gain witnessed in three months. Although the 0.1% increase in consumer prices was in line with market expectations, it continues to highlight how stubbornly low inflation in the United States remains a recurrent theme. While it is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December, the future path of rate hikes beyond 2017, is open to discussion amid low inflation concerns. On a positive note, U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.2% in October which is likely to boost sentiment towards the U.S. economy and offer some support to the tired dollar. Taking a look at the technical picture, the dollar Index dipped towards 93.40 following the release. The 94.00 level has the ability to transform into a dynamic resistance that could encourage a further decline towards 93.50 and 93.00, respectively. A solid breakout back above 94.50 threatens the current bearish setup. US markets are on the slide again, hit by a falling oil price and continuing worries about the ability of the Republicans to achieve their proposed tax cuts. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is down 0.9% at $55.19 a barrel after the International Energy Agency issued a gloomy outlook on the prospects for global demand for oil. Later come the latest US crude inventory figures, with investors worried they might show an increase. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 155 points or 0.66% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.5% lower and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.58%. Back in London, a Bank of England deputy governor has insisted that wages should rise in 2018 as low unemployment forces bosses to pay more for labour. Obviously there\u2019s not much sign of this happening yet, given today\u2019s lacklustre wage growth. But Ben Broadbent insists that reports of the death of the Phillips Curve (the classic inverse relationship between unemployment and pay) were exaggerated. Broadbent told an audience in London that: \u201cSeveral commentators have questioned the MPC\u2019s central prediction that wage growth will rise next year. Some have gone further and pronounced the death of the Phillips curve. There are always risks to any forecast. But the latter claim, at least, is premature.\u201d Broadbent also blamed the tumble in the pound after the EU referendum for pushing down real wages, as the weak currency made imports pricier and thus pushed inflation up. Breaking away from UK unemployment briefly, there are three important developments in Greece. First, the Greek government has launched a \u20ac30bn debt swap, asking investors to hand over existing bonds in return for new debt. It\u2019s an attempt to ease Athens\u2019 return to the financial markets after years of bailouts. These new bonds won\u2019t mature for many years, sparing Greece any nervy repayment deadlines. But secondly, ratings agency DBRS has warned that Greece is unlikely to make much progress in its current bailout talks this year. Thirdly, the country\u2019s leftist-led government has taken further steps to relax capital controls that were imposed to stop its banks collapsing during the crisis two years ago. Helena Smith reports from Athens The Greek government\u2019s narrative of impending exit from seemingly perpetual crisis took a knock today as the Toronto-based rating agency said it was unlikely that Athens would complete crucial bailout talks before the end of the year. In a note the ratings service reckoned a compliance review with international auditors representing creditors keeping Greece afloat would not be completed until 2018. Wrapping up the review was key to unlocking debt relief talks and discussions on the type of support Greece would receive once its current bailout programme ended in August next year Meanwhile, the leftist-led coalition took another step Wednesday towards easing capital controls imposed to prevent a run on banks at the height of the debt crisis. A degree that went into effect today, foresees depositors being able to fully withdraw sums in bank accounts transferred from overseas as of December 1st. People who have not previously held bank accounts will also be able to open one under the new regulations signed by finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and published in the government gazette. Despite what the chancellor\u2019s tweeted (see earlier) UK unemployment isn\u2019t actually a record low. The current jobless rate of just 4.3% is the lowest since 1975; in early 1974 it was just 3.6%. Today\u2019s jobless total of 1.42 million also isn\u2019t a record - it was lower in 2004 and 2005. Thanks to economics professor Danny Blanchflower for flagging this up. In another significant development, The Young Women\u2019s Trust has warned an extra 42,000 young people dropped out of the labour market and the education sector in the last three months. This group became economically inactive, and were not in education or training either - a worrying sign. Joe Levenson, communications and campaigns director at the Young Women\u2019s Trust, says the jump highlights the challenge facing young adults - particularly mothers with young children. Levenson says: \u201c42,000 more young people are now economically inactive and out of education \u2013 a dramatic increase on the last quarter. \u201cYoung women in particular are telling us they want to work but hundreds of thousands are getting shut out of the jobs market, including by a lack of convenient childcare and support. While the Government focuses on reducing its unemployment figures, 343,000 young women who are not included in the numbers are being left jobless and forgotten. \u201cAt the same time, we have a youth debt epidemic, which is only set to worsen as prices rise and wages remain low. It can be especially hard for young mums; in many cases, an hour\u2019s childcare can cost more than an hour\u2019s wages. It\u2019s time for action. \u201cMuch more needs to be done to improve young people\u2019s prospects. This means giving them the right skills and support to find jobs, ensuring decent and flexible jobs are available, and extended the National Living Wage to under-25s, so they are paid the same amount for the same work. This will not only help them to become financially independent but will benefit businesses and the economy too.\u201d This chart shows how the number of young adults who have left the labour force has risen, while those in work or looking for work has dropped: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has just welcomed the drop in unemployment and the rise in productivity seen today. (I suspect this tweet didn\u2019t come directly from the chancellor\u2019s thumbs; it would be very disrespectful to tweet during Prime Minister\u2019s Questions - as Hammond is sat next to Theresa May on the front bench) The number of people from other EU countries working in Britain has hit a record high, up by 112,000 in the last year. That takes the total number of EU nationals to 2.38m. There are also 28.55m UK nationals in work (up 183,000 in the last year), and 1.21 million non-EU workers (down by 23,000). That\u2019s according to today\u2019s labour market report - here\u2019s the key chart: My colleague Alan Travis has examined the data, and writes: The figures from the Office of National Statistics show that the number of Polish and other east European nationals working in Britain has dropped for the first time in more than 10 years, down from 1,054,000 in the summer of 2016 to 1,035,000. The number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in Britain has, however, continued to rise, from from 257,000 to 347,000 \u2013 a 90,000 increase that accounts for the majority of the overall increase in the last year. More here: With wages lagging inflation, struggling families may be forced to hit their credit cards hard this Christmas. Positive Money\u2019s director Fran Boait hopes that Philip Hammond can help next week - especially as the Bank of England has raised the cost of borrowing: \u201cAs real pay continues to fall, households are being forced to borrow ever-greater amounts to make ends meet. The economy is being kept afloat on the back of families\u2019 credit cards, at increasingly high interest rates. In the budget later this month, the Chancellor must act to boost investment and deliver a sustainable boost to incomes, before it\u2019s too late. We\u2019ve had a rates rise - now it\u2019s time for a pay rise.\u201d The Resolution Foundation, the UK think tank, fears that Britain\u2019s jobs market is losing momentum. They are concerned by the drop in employment over the summer, as it could show the labour market is plateauing. The persistent failure of wages to rise when workers have been in shorter supply is another worry. They say: The biggest pay squeeze is taking place in other service sectors (-2.7%), public administration (-2.2%) and real estate (-1.9%), while pay growth is strongest in agriculture (+3.9%) and in support services (+0.8%). Stephen Clarke, Resolution\u2019s economic analyst, expects real wages to keep falling for the next few months. He says: \u201cAfter years of impressive growth, there are signs that the labour market may be losing momentum. \u201cThe still strong picture on employment still refuses to have any meaningful impact on wage growth, as Britain\u2019s pay squeeze is getting deeper. \u201cToday\u2019s welcome productivity figures offer a glimmer of hope on pay, though it\u2019s too early to say whether it can grow into a meaningful recovery.\u201d Resolution have also produced some charts to explain the pay squeeze: Amid the real wage gloom, there is an encouraging sign..... Britain\u2019s economy appears to have become more productive. The ONS estimates that productivity per hour grew by 0.9% in the third quarter of 2017. That\u2019s the first increase since the end of 2016, and is the highest rate of growth since Quarter 2 2011. This could be a crucial factor in getting wages up -- as bosses have been blaming weak productivity for the meagre pay increases doled out to their staff. David Willett, Corporate Director at The Open University, says it\u2019s an \u2018encouraging development\u2019, adding: \u201cFor too long the UK has been lagging behind, with a lack of higher skills limiting the agility and adaptability needed to drive organisations forward. Stagnant productivity is a significant barrier to growth at an uncertain time when we need to ensure the stability of our economy. \u201cOrganisations now need to keep this up. With technology advancing at a rapid rate, and businesses looking to automate where they can, low-skilled jobs are increasingly under threat. It\u2019s crucial that organisations invest in training their staff to build up essential technical and soft skills to future-proof them against changes in the political, economic and technological environment.\u201d There\u2019s something for everyone in today\u2019s jobs report. Britain\u2019s minister for employment, Damian Hinds, has hailed the drop in UK unemployment: \u201cThe strength of the economy is driving an increase in full-time, permanent jobs and a near-record number of people are now in work thanks to the Government\u2019s welfare reforms. \u201cWhen unemployment fell to 5% early last year, many people thought it couldn\u2019t get much lower, and yet it now stands at 4.3%.\u201d Everyone should be given the opportunity to find work and enjoy the stability of a regular pay packet. We\u2019ve cut income tax for 30 million people since 2010, meaning people keep more of their money each month.\u201d But the labour market looks quite different if you\u2019re on the opposition front bench. Debbie Abrahams MP, Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, points out that the cost of living squeeze hasn\u2019t abated: \u201cToday\u2019s stats are further evidence of Tory economic failure, only a week out from their next Budget. \u201cBoth employment and real wages are falling while the price of household essentials balloons, leaving millions of people worse off than they were in 2010. \u201cOver seven million people live in poverty in working households. \u201cLabour will introduce a \u00a310 an hour real Living Wage, scrap the public sector pay cap and reform the government\u2019s failing Universal Credit programme.\u201d Britain is now suffering its second wage squeeze since the financial crisis, as this chart from the FT shows: How can unemployment and employment both have fallen, I hear you cry. The answer is that the number of adults classed as \u2018economically inactive\u2019 has gone up. That means more people have simply dropped out of the labour market altogether. Geraint Johnes, Research Director at the Work Foundation and Professor of Economics at Lancaster University Management School, explains: \u201cThe latest labour market statistics show unemployment continuing to fall \u2013 by some 59000 between the second and third quarters of this year. The unemployment rate now stands at 4.3%. The most recent fall, however, is due largely to a large increase in the number of people deemed economically inactive. And here\u2019s the key chart, showing how the number of economically inactive people in Britain rose by 151,000 in the last quarter. That will include students, people stopping work to care for a family member, or look after young children, or just giving up the search for a job altogether. Professor Johnes has also spotted that more people are only working part-time: Meanwhile, part-time employment has risen, with an increase of 18000 part-time employees and 45000 part-time self-employed. Inasmuch as it continues a trend towards greater casualisation and insecurity in the labour market, this should be noted as a cause for concern. Overall the level of employment has fallen. Britain\u2019s ongoing wage squeeze is a \u201chuge body blow\u201d to consumers as they try to make ends meet in the run-up to Christmas, says Maike Currie of Fidelity International She fears that real wage growth will remain \u201celusive\u201d for some time: With a number of factors keeping a lid on our earnings - from people working flat out in the gig economy yet still struggling with paltry pay, more and more people in self-employment, falling unionisation, automation and technology substituting man for machine, this is unlikely to change any time soon.\u201d Nick Macpherson, formerly the top civil servant at the Treasury, fears that the UK labour market is cooling.... Here are some charts showing the state of the UK labour market: This chart from the Office for National Statistics shows how wage growth has struggled to get much above 2% this year. And that means that real wages are falling, whether or not you include bonuses: Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in nominal terms (that is, not adjusted for price inflation) increased by 2.2% both including and excluding bonuses, compared with a year earlier. Latest estimates show that average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain in real terms (that is, adjusted for price inflation) fell by 0.4% including bonuses, and fell by 0.5% excluding bonuses, compared with a year earlier. The pound has risen slightly, as City traders welcome the pick-up in wage growth in the last quarter. Breaking! The number of people in employment across the UK has fallen, for the first time in nearly a year. There were 32.06 million people in work in July-September, which is a 14,000 drop on the previous quarter. This is the first drop since August-October 2016, and the biggest decline since April-June 2015. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work) was 75.0%, down slightly compared with April to June 2017 but up from 74.4% for a year earlier, according to the Office for National Statistics. Britain\u2019s jobless rate remains at a 42-year low of just 4.3%. Unemployment fell by 59,000 between July and September to 1.42 million, the Office for National Statistics says. That\u2019s 182,000 less than a year earlier. Breaking! Britain\u2019s wages squeeze continued to bite in the last quarter, according to the latest Labour Market report just released. Basic pay rose by just 2.2% per year in July-September, meaning that wages continued to lag inflation. Pay including bonuses also rose by 2.2%. In contrast, inflation was 2.7% in August, rising to 3% in September and October. More to follow... Britain has rediscovered its taste for Angel Delight! Sales of the retro desert are up 30%, in a boost for Premier Foods. Angel Delight first hit the shelves in the late 60s, when UK cuisine was more basic.... Overnight, Japan has posted its seventh consecutive quarter of growth, the longest run in over a decade. Japanese GDP rose by 0.3% during the July-September, with rising exports making up for weaker domestic demand. This will be welcomed by Tokyo as it tries to put Japan\u2019s \u2018lost decades\u2019 behind it, and achieve steady growth and inflation. But it also means Japan will be one of the slower-growing G7 nations in the third quarter; Germany grew by 0.8%, America by 0.75%, France and Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by 0.4%. All eyes on Canada.... On a nominal basis (not discounting for inflation), Japanese growth was 0.6%. This chart, from manufacturing group EEF, shows how UK wages have fallen below inflation (the dotted line) this year: Today\u2019s jobs report will paint a picture of an economy suffering from subdued wage growth, but enjoying record low unemployment. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, says the pound could suffer if the wage figures are particularly bad. He writes: Although Britain\u2019s unemployment rate is at a 42-year low, the buzzkill remains, that little sign of rising pay growth continues to weigh heavily on sentiment. If average earnings struggle to pick up, consumers are likely to continue feeling the squeeze, especially when considering how inflation remains at a five-and-a-half year high, at 3%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s real wage squeeze is set to deepen today, when we get new data showing how the UK labour market is performing. Economists predict that basic pay (excluding bonuses) grew by around 2.2% per annum in the July-September quarter, up from 2.1% a month ago. Any increase would be welcome, but this would still leave wages lagging behind inflation - which ran at a five-year high of 3% in September and October. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada warn that UK wages will remain subdued for several months, but might then rise faster. With the Bank of England\u2019s Regional Agents\u2019 survey indicating pay settlements could pick up next year to 2.5-3.5% next year, it could well be some way into 2018 before there is sufficient evidence from the labour market reports that pay growth is making a meaningful advance. Today\u2019s report may also show Britain\u2019s unemployment rate stuck at just 4.3%, the lowest in over four decades. In theory, such a tight labour market ought to drive wages higher as bosses compete to recruit workers. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: With unemployment at 42 year lows of 4.3%, it surely can only be a matter of time before wage pressure starts to manifest itself further..... We\u2019ve already started to see increasing evidence that wages at the lower end of the income scale are rising at rates faster than inflation as the effects of increases in the minimum and living wage help pull up wages at the bottom of the pay scales. This should inevitably see a trickle up effect as earners higher up the income scale start to demand higher wages in a tightening labour market,. European stock markets are expected to dip this morning ahead of the jobs report, which is released at 9.30am.

However, the latest data for October saw core CPI expectedly rise to 1.8% year on year, providing some tentative evidence that inflation may be finally starting to turn a corner. Headline CPI dipped back slightly to 2% as gasoline prices re-adjust following the hurricanes a couple of months ago.</p> <p>This rise in core CPI tallies with the latest above-consensus producer-price inflation data released yesterday, which saw core PPI hit a five-year high of 2.4%. Given the weaker dollar and higher energy prices, we are optimistic that inflationary pressures will continue to build as we head into next year. Likewise, we also expect wage growth to continue gradually picking up in 2018.</p> <p>There was some equally good news from today\u2019s retail sales data. The headline rate of growth was held back somewhat by falling gasoline prices. But 0.3% month on month growth in the control group (which excludes volatile items) suggest that consumers started the fourth quarter on a solid footing. This is one reason why we are looking for another near-3% GDP growth reading this quarter.</p> <p>All of this argues in favour of a December rate hike, but markets are still sceptical that we will get much more than one hike during next year. However, with the Fed broadening out the reasons for tightening policy - with references to loose financial conditions and rich asset valuations - we suspect investors are too cautious. There is also the annual rotation of regional Fed voters, which will see two hawks (Williams and Mester) take over the votes of two doves (Kashkari and Evans) in 2018. We expect two hikes next year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a0c522402d23606ce8c99d0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-15T14:53:50.088Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US retail sales rise, as consumer prices edge up</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier there was some US data, showing both retail sales and inflation on the rise, albeit a very small increase in the latter</p> <p>An increase in car purchases helped retail sales rise to a better than expected 0.2% in October, offsetting a decline in demand for building materials.

On a positive note, U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.2% in October which is likely to boost sentiment towards the U.S. economy and offer some support to the tired dollar.</p> <p>Taking a look at the technical picture, the dollar Index dipped towards 93.40 following the release. The 94.00 level has the ability to transform into a dynamic resistance that could encourage a further decline towards 93.50 and 93.00, respectively. A solid breakout back above 94.50 threatens the current bearish setup.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a0c512202d23606ce8c99bd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-11-15T14:41:35.704Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens lower</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets are on the slide again, hit by a falling oil price and continuing worries about the ability of the Republicans to achieve their proposed tax cuts.</p> <p>West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is down 0.9% at $55.19 a barrel after the International Energy Agency issued a gloomy outlook on the prospects for global demand for oil.

      "bodyText": "The latest wages growth data suggest the bottom over low growth has been reached. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is there is little sign of any rebound \u2013 with growth remaining at historic lows and showing virtually no improvement at all in real wages. After an over four years run of slowing wages growth, in the past 12 months we have seen growth improve. Whereas in the 12 months to June, wages grew just 1.9%, in the 12 months to September growth improved all the way to 2.0%. So it would seem we have hit the bottom, but to be honest, it would have been almost impossible for wages to grow any slower, and as it is, it\u2019s not like there is any great rebound occurring. In the September quarter, private sector wages grew by just 0.48% in both seasonally adjusted and trend terms. It means that it has now been two and half years since private sector wages have grown by more than 0.5% in any quarter. And while the public sector saw slightly stronger growth \u2013 its September quarter growth of 0.54% was the lowest on record: The result was somewhat of a disappointment \u2013 with the market expecting that the June decision to raise the minimum wage by 3.3% might produce a bit of a bounce. Instead the low growth figures saw the value of the dollar fall by 0.6% as they provided yet more evidence that there is little need for the Reserve Bank to raise interest rates. The sector to see the biggest growth in September was the accommodation and food services industry. As is always the case, due to the high prevalence of workers on the minimum wage there was a spike in wages growth in the quarter, but in annual terms, the industry\u2019s wage growth of 2.1% was slower than observed in the 12 months to June: The growth of private sector wages was lowest in the mining industry, but here at least there has been some clear improvement. Six months ago, wages in the mining industry were growing by a record low 0.6%; now they are up to 1.2% \u2013 still easily the slowest growth of any industry, but at least a sign that things are not getting worse: Not getting worse is also about the best you can say about real wages. In September, inflation grew by 1.83% both according to the official CPI figure and the RBA\u2019s core inflation measure of the \u201ctrimmed mean\u201d. It means real private sector wages in the past year grew by just 0.02%: This continues an utterly dreadful four year period of next to no real wages growth. From 2002 to the GFC hitting in 2008, real wages grew each year on average by 0.9%. From March 2010 until March 2013, real wages grew by 1.2% each year, but since then they have grown on average by just 0.03%: Real wages are now just 0.1% above where they were in March 2013. And the real worry is where this is all heading. One of the biggest problems with ongoing low wages growth is it can create a structural shift such that lower wages growth becomes expected in conditions that previously would have seen higher wages. We have seen this most obviously in the relationship between unemployment and wages growth. The \u201cPhillips curve\u201d, which normally sees wages growth increase as the unemployment rate falls has become utterly broken in the past three years. Despite improving unemployment we have seen falling wages growth \u2013 something that is not meant to occur: The past year has seen a slight return of the relationship, but at a completely different scale. Whereas in the past a shift from 5.8% unemployment to the current level of 5.5% would have seen an expected improvement in wages growth from 3.2% to 3.4%; now the shift is from 1.9% to 2.0%. The worry is the relationship has effectively shifted down such that wages growth will be lower for each level of unemployment than it was before. If this occurs, not only will it mean workers can get used to low wages for a long time to come, it also would blow a big hole in the government\u2019s budget figures. The May budget predicted that by June next year wages would be growing at 2.5% and would improve to 3.0% by June 2019: Already this means that wages to grow on average by 0.7% in each of the next three quarters \u2013 something that hasn\u2019t occurred in any one quarter since March 2014. So while we are no longer talking about record low wages, we continue to talk of ongoing low wages growth, with little sign of improvement around the corner. It suggests weaker income tax revenue than the government hopes, and weaker growth of real wages than any of us would wish.",

      "bodyText": "The bakery chain Greggs has apologised for offending Christians with a nativity scene advert that replaces Jesus with a sausage roll. The chief executive of the Freedom Association, a rightwing pressure group, claimed the advert was \u201csick\u201d and that the retailer would \u201cnever dare\u201d insult other religions. The UK Evangelical Alliance strongly criticised the baker, saying it was a gimmick that seemed to be about \u201cmanufacturing a scandal to sell baked goods\u201d. Greggs released the image to promote its \u00a324 advent calendar, which goes on sale next Monday. Its decision to use an image depicting the three wise men gathering round a crib containing a sausage roll sparked criticism from Twitter users and religious groups. Greggs is not withdrawing the product \u2013 its first ever advent calendar \u2013 but said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019re really sorry to have caused any offence, this was never our intention.\u201d Simon Richards, chief executive of the Freedom Association, tweeted: \u201cPlease boycott @GreggsOfficial to protest against its sick anti-Christian advent calendar. \u201cWhat cowards these people are: we all know that they would never dare insult other religions! They should donate every penny of their profits to @salvationarmyuk.\u201d Christians on Twitter said the advert was disrespectful. \u201cI\u2019m glad Christians kicked off and Greggs apologised,\u201d wrote one Twitter user. \u201cNo other religion would stand for that nonsense.\u201d The calendars will go on sale in selected Greggs shops across the UK from Monday. The cover image features the Festive Bake pastry in a Santa Claus bag and bears the greeting \u201cMerry Greggsmas\u201d. Each door reveals a festive scene with a Greggs twist, such as kissing a Festive Bake under the mistletoe, and a Christmas tree adorned with mini gingerbread tree biscuits. Each calendar\u2019s discounts are worth between \u00a335-\u00a360; in most cases a \u00a35 gift card sits behind door 24, though some lucky customers will get a \u00a325 card. The Rev Mark Edwards, of St Matthew\u2019s church in Dinnington and St Cuthbert\u2019s church in Brunswick, said Greggs had been disrespectful. He told the Newcastle-based Chronicle: \u201cIt goes beyond just commercialism, it\u2019s showing a total disregard and disrespect towards one of the greatest stories ever told, and I think people of all faiths will be offended by this.\u201d Daniel Webster, a spokesperson for the Evangelical Alliance, said: \u201cPutting a sausage roll in the manger of a nativity scene seems to be manufacturing a scandal to sell baked goods and neglecting the real scandal of Christmas. Every year some company creates a Christmas controversy for commercial gain; it seems to get earlier each year.\u201d The advert also triggered debate on the Greggs Facebook page, though most posts welcomed the product.

The shopping thoroughfare overtook the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris in the global ranking compiled by the property company Cushman &amp; Wakefield. New York\u2019s Upper Fifth Avenue retained its number one spot, followed by Causeway Bay in Hong Kong, with Via Montenapoleone in Milan fourth, ahead of the French boulevard. Rents on Bond Street, home to some of the biggest names in luxury including Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior and Herm\u00e8s, surged by nearly 40% in the year to June, according to the report. Demand was strong \u201cdespite the noise around Brexit\u201d as record numbers of tourists took advantage of the low pound to stock up on branded goods, with Burberry among the retailers to have enjoyed a sales increase. Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Darren Yates, the report\u2019s author, said: \u201cLondon\u2019s major thoroughfares are some of the most desirable and expensive streets in the world. \u201cAlthough there was a pause in activity in London in the initial aftermath of the EU referendum, the start of 2017 brought a resurgence in leasing deals.\u201d Upper Fifth Avenue commands average annual rents of $3,000 (\u00a32,280) per square foot, while Causeway Bay is on $2,725 after a 4.7% fall. Bond Street soared into third place after rents increased by 37.5% to $1,720. Over the summer, there were concerns that Bond Street\u2019s status was under threat after a number of retailers were said to be \u201cquietly\u201d marketing their leases due to the combination of high rental and business rate costs. According to the business rates specialists CVS, Bond Street was one of the biggest victims of the shake-up in rates, with luxury retailers on Old and New Bond Street \u2013 they are commonly referred to as Bond Street \u2013 required to find an extra \u00a3160m over the next five years. In the past, Bond Street tenants have stumped up millions of pounds of \u201ckey money\u201d \u2013 the premium handed over to an existing retailer to buy their lease \u2013 in addition to the rent agreed, but property experts said the markets appeared to be cooling. Yates said the steep rises on Bond Street could not \u201ccarry on for ever\u201d, but added: \u201cThere has been a lot of talk about retailers wanting to leave Bond Street, but to my knowledge that\u2019s not true.

    "webTitle": "UK employment falls for first time since aftermath of Brexit vote", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Signs that Britain\u2019s long employment boom has come to an end emerged on Wednesday as official figures showed a drop in the number of people in work, a fall in full-time employment and a decline in the number of job vacancies. After a record-breaking run, the The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported the first fall in employment since the immediate aftermath of last year\u2019s Brexit vote. The ONS said the number of people employed had fallen by 14,000 in the three months to September to just over 32 million. While the number of people in work was still up by 279,000 on a year ago, the ONS said it was the first fall since the slight reduction in the quarter ending in October 2016 and the biggest drop since the April to June period of 2015. The employment rate was cut from 75.1% to 75%. Further evidence of a weaker labour market came from a fall in job vacancies, a 29,000 decline in the number of full-time jobs and an increase in the number of part-time workers saying that they would like to have full-time employment. The number of people unemployed fell by 59,000 in the three months to September, bringing the total down to 1.425 million but leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.3%. The ONS said both employment and unemployment were down due to a rise in the number of the economically inactive \u2013 people who have stopped looking for work. Damian Hinds, the employment minister, said: \u201cThe strength of the economy is driving an increase in full-time, permanent jobs and a near-record number of people are now in work thanks to the government\u2019s welfare reforms. \u201cWhen unemployment fell to 5% early last year, many people thought it couldn\u2019t get much lower, and yet it now stands at 4.3%.\u201d But with growth in earnings lagging well behind the current inflation rate, the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said the government should raise the national minimum wage to \u00a310 an hour as quickly as possible. \u201cThis is the seventh month in a row that prices have risen faster than wages. But ministers are still standing on the side-lines,\u201d O\u2019Grady said. Earnings excluding bonuses were 2.2% higher in the three months ending in September than they were in the same three months of 2016 \u2013 no change on the upwardly revised figures for the period ending in August. City analysts said the lack of any acceleration in earnings growth eased the pressure on the Bank of England to increase the cost of borrowing following the quarter-point rise to 0.5% earlier this month. The slowdown in employment coupled with modest growth in the economy\u2019s output resulted in a sharp improvement in the UK\u2019s productivity rate, which was up by 0.9% between the second and third quarters of 2017 \u2013 its fastest rate of increase in six years. John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist, an economic consultancy, said: \u201cThe latest jobs and productivity figures suggest that UK employers are finally having to respond to much tighter labour market conditions as the economy edges closer to full employment. Although the economy continued to grow, there was no net hiring in the third quarter of the year, with businesses cutting full-time jobs and switching to increased use of part-time workers.\u201d The ONS statistician Matt Hughes said: \u201cAfter two years of almost uninterrupted growth, employment has declined slightly on the quarter. \u201cHowever, it remains higher than it was this time last year, and as always we would caution people against reading too much into one quarter\u2019s data. Unemployment also fell on the quarter, but there was a rise in the number of people who were neither working nor looking for a job \u2013 so-called economically inactive people.\u201d Nigel Meager, director of the Institute for Employment Studies thinktank, said: \u201cIt is notable that the other main indicator of worklessness in the working-age population (economic inactivity) has been increasing recently to 21.6%. Indeed, today\u2019s statistics release shows the largest quarterly increase in economic inactivity since the three months to January 2010. While it is early days, and the next few months\u2019 statistics will be needed to confirm this, these data certainly raise the question of whether the long and sustained recent labour market boom is finally running out of steam.\u201d \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

But ministers are still standing on the side-lines,\u201d O\u2019Grady said.</p> <p>Earnings excluding bonuses were 2.2% higher in the three months ending in September than they were in the same three months of 2016 \u2013 no change on the upwardly revised figures for the period ending in August. City analysts said the lack of any acceleration in earnings growth eased the pressure on the Bank of England to increase the cost of borrowing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/02/bank-of-england-raises-uk-interest-rates-brexit-inflation\">following the quarter-point rise to 0.5% earlier this month.</a></p> <p>The slowdown in employment coupled with modest growth in the economy\u2019s output resulted in a sharp improvement in the UK\u2019s productivity rate, which was up by 0.9% between the second and third quarters of 2017 \u2013 its fastest rate of increase in six years.</p> <p>John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist, an economic consultancy, said: \u201cThe latest jobs and productivity figures suggest that UK employers are finally having to respond to much tighter labour market conditions as the economy edges closer to full employment. Although the economy continued to grow, there was no net hiring in the third quarter of the year, with businesses cutting full-time jobs and switching to increased use of part-time workers.\u201d </p> <p>The ONS statistician Matt Hughes said: \u201cAfter two years of almost uninterrupted growth, employment has declined slightly on the quarter.<br></p> <p>\u201cHowever, it remains higher than it was this time last year, and as always we would caution people against reading too much into one quarter\u2019s data. Unemployment also fell on the quarter, but there was a rise in the number of people who were neither working nor looking for a job \u2013 so-called economically inactive people.\u201d</p> <p>Nigel Meager, director of the Institute for Employment Studies thinktank, said: \u201cIt is notable that the other main indicator of worklessness in the working-age population (economic inactivity) has been increasing recently to 21.6%. Indeed, today\u2019s statistics release shows the largest quarterly increase in economic inactivity since the three months to January 2010. While it is early days, and the next few months\u2019 statistics will be needed to confirm this, these data certainly raise the question of whether the long and sustained recent labour market boom is finally running out of steam.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.<br></p>",

The watchdog worked itself into a fine fury a couple of years ago over the obscure merger between Poundland and 99p Stores. It eventually reached the commonsense conclusion that the deal would not deliver a fatal blow to competition on the high street, but it needed two attempts to get there. Now, presented with the more substantial \u00a33.7bn takeover of Booker by Tesco, the CMA has declared that it can\u2019t see why anybody would make a fuss. Small convenience stores should not worry about Tesco getting even bigger. The catering trade will be unaffected, apparently. The deal can proceed without remedies. The CMA \u201cseemingly lives in a different universe,\u201d declared Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital. One can only agree. Tesco, with Londis and Budgens under its umbrella, is set to have an extraordinary hold over the convenience-store market. It is baffling the CMA did not insist \u2013 at the very least \u2013 on Tesco selling its One Stop chain. Still, the Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, predicted exactly this outcome, so we should give him credit for being able to read the minds of the CMA\u2019s policy wonks. Now \u2013 for him \u2013 comes the harder part of convincing his own shareholders that swallowing Booker is sensible. He\u2019s already lost one non-executive director over the deal: Compass Group\u2019s Richard Cousins quit in protest, arguing that making Tesco more complicated was the wrong way to go. And the resistance of Schroders and Artisan, two shareholders speaking for 9% of Tesco\u2019s stock, remains. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how good a strategy is if you pay the wrong price,\u201d said Schroders on Tuesday. Given that Tesco is offering 23 times earnings on some measures, the revolting shareholders\u2019 argument is strong. Nobody else has yet rallied to Schroders/Artisan flag, but maybe they were waiting for the CMA to opine. Either way, Lewis should not take a thumbs-up for granted. City analysts suspect he\u2019s been understating the potential cost-savings and that he\u2019s really looking for twice the declared \u00a3200m. If that\u2019s correct, it\u2019s time to speak up. Satisfying the CMA is one thing. What Lewis really needs is the traditional thumping majority from the owners. Getting the deal across the line with a majority of, say, only 75% would be a moral defeat. Would Davis bring too much drama to Rio Tinto? Nobody appoints Sir Mick Davis to their board if they want a quiet life. Mick the Miner built Xstrata from a small collection of Glencore\u2019s cast-off mines into a global operator that was eventually worth $50bn. Those were deal-making days for the industry and Davis was in the vanguard. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be a player. What\u2019s the point of being in business if you can\u2019t be a player?\u201d he said in a speech in 2009. There were serious mistakes along the way, such as a woefully-timed bid for Lonmin, and Xstrata\u2019s final year was dominated by the Glencore soap opera. A merger of equals became a full-blooded takeover, with Davis\u2019 spiky relationship with his counterpart, Ivan Glasenberg, under the spotlight. But Xstrata\u2019s long-term backers always knew what they getting \u2013 drama, action and big personal rewards for Davis and his crew. Many of those qualities should make him a terrible candidate to be the next chairman of Rio Tinto. Mega pay packets go down badly these days. And Rio (when it isn\u2019t being charged with fraud by US regulators, a matter relating to the fallout from a 2011 deal) has spent the last five years trying to turn itself into a model of corporate dullness. The solid generation of cash is supposed to the goal. In Davis\u2019s favour, it might be said that having a mining industry veteran as chairman of a big mining company is hardly an outlandish idea. And, if Rio\u2019s chief executive Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques is really as headstrong as he\u2019s painted, it might help to have Davis on hand as the voice of experience. Davis is also said to be have mellowed over the years (just as well, given the state of the Conservative party, where he is chief executive). In the end, one suspects Rio\u2019s board will play safe and opt for a current non-executive director. That would be very boring, but probably wise: if Rio\u2019s investors crave thrills, they can always buy shares in Glencore. Vodafone chief may not be ready for a new contract It\u2019s taken so long that we almost stopped watching, but the reinvigoration of Vodafone is finally happening. The telecoms giant upgraded its profit forecast for the first time anybody could remember. The old guidance said operating profits would improve by 4%-8% but the company now reckons it will do 10%. The difference may not sound much, but this is a very large business \u2013 top-line earnings should be around \u20ac14.8bn. Free cash flow is running at a shade over \u20ac5bn a year, so a dividend costing \u20ac4bn now looks very solid, which wasn\u2019t always the case. Time for the chief executive, Vittorio Colao, to declare victory and bow out after nine years in charge? Actually, in his shoes you\u2019d probably keep going. Gentler breezes from the eurozone, Vodafone\u2019s biggest market, have arrived and you might as well enjoy them.

      "bodyText": "Shares in TalkTalk plummeted by 17% in early trading after it reported a \u00a375m loss and warned that full year profits will be at the lower end of its guidance. The Embattled telecoms company, which is facing the legal fallout of data breaches following a cyber-attack in 2015, ran up \u00a390m in exceptional charges relating to restructuring to refocus on its core proposition as a budget internet provider. In February, Charles Dunstone, who created TalkTalk in 2002, returned as executive chairman in an attempt to renew investors\u2019 faith. In May, Dido Harding left the company after seven years and was replaced as chief executive by Tristia Harrison. Harrison said the business had reversed customer losses and seen \u201cstrong demand\u201d for its new cut-price TV, internet and phone services. However, investment to attract more customers would leave TalkTalk\u2019s full year profits at the lower end of its \u00a3270m-\u00a3300m range, she said. \u201cWe expect to step up our planned investment in growth in the second half, as we take advantage of the strong demand,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cOur revised strategy of focusing the business on fewer, clearer priorities is re-establishing TalkTalk as the value provider of choice in the UK fixed connectivity market.\u201d The company added 46,000 customers in the first six months of its financial year, compared with a drop of 29,000 in the same period last year. TalkTalk said its broadband base grew for the third successive quarter and customer churn, the rate at which people leave for rivals, had improved year on year from 1.5% to 1.3%. \u201cOur clear value proposition is resonating strongly against an uncertain economic environment and underpins our plan to simplify and focus all our investment in delivering affordable, reliable fixed connectivity to homes and businesses,\u201d Harrison said. TalkTalk reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a375m in the six months to September, compared with a \u00a330m profit in the same period last year, as revenues fell by 5% to \u00a3828m. \u201cWhen we simplified and reset the business in May, we said our priorities were growth, cash and EBITDA [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation], in that order,\u201d the chief executive said. \u201cThe first half performance shows we are delivering on that plan.\u201d The company took a \u00a359m exceptional charge for costs including \u00a320m associated with \u201cimplementing changes to the group\u2019s organisational structure under the new leadership team\u201d. There was also a \u00a331m charge at its mobile business as a result of a strategy review. The company said it would launch a \u201csimple and compelling new mobile proposition\u201d by the end of the year. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Angel Delight is making a comeback half a century after the whipped dessert first hit the shelves. Sales of the brand jumped 30% over the six months to the end of September, according to its maker, Premier Foods, as consumers were tempted back by a new ready-to-eat version of the retro milky dessert, first launched in 1967 by Birds. \u201cAngel Delight, one of the group\u2019s smaller and historically less heavily invested brands, grew by 30% in the period, benefiting from the launch of convenient ready-to-eat pots,\u201d the company said. In its traditional form, which is still available, consumers whisk milk into the Angel Delight powder, which comes in strawberry, chocolate, banana and butterscotch flavours. The range includes \u201cno added sugar\u201d alternatives in the same flavours. The resurgence of Angel Delight reflected a broader trend in Premier\u2019s first-half results, as consumers opted for products that were designed to be eaten \u201con the go\u201d. \u201cBatchelors is now the fastest-growing major brand in our portfolio following the launch this year of convenient pot format products such as Super Noodle pots,\u201d said the Premier Foods chief executive, Gavin Darby. \u201cThe Batchelors brand has also benefited substantially from the launch of Pasta \u2019n\u2019 Sauce pots, another range of convenient quick meals perfectly suited to today\u2019s time-conscious consumer.\u201d Molly Johnson-Jones, senior food and grocery analyst at Global Data, said Premier Foods was tapping into a growing consumer trend of \u201con the go\u201d snacking with an established brand. \u201cThere has been huge growth in food on the go, largely because of a consumer base that shops at convenience stores \u2013 time-poor millennials who might pop in for lunch and buy a few things,\u201d she said. \u201cThe trend of people bringing in their lunch to work has declined, with consumers looking for things to be more immediate. They want quick and easy products, and supermarkets and convenience stores are tapping into that and seeing it as a growth area. The stores are trying to emulate the Pret and Itsu chains.\u201d Other brands owned by the group include Ambrosia, Mr Kipling and Oxo. Premier Foods\u2019 sales rose 1.5% over the six months to \u00a3353.3m, while pre-tax losses narrowed to \u00a31.2m from \u00a38.7m over the same period a year earlier. Darby said a strong performance in the second quarter, with sales up 6.2%, helped to offset a \u201cchallenging\u201d first quarter. He added that expectations for the full year were unchanged. The company\u2019s international business is being boosted by rising demand in Australia for Mr Kipling and Cadbury cakes, which have also recently been launched in New Zealand. Darby said Premier\u2019s strategic partnerships with Japanese instant noodle company Nissin and Cadbury owner Mondelez International were paying off, together delivering more than 40% of revenue growth in the second quarter. Analysts at Credit Suisse said the second-quarter performance was \u201cvery encouraging\u201d.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "CitySprint has been accused of \u201cmaking a mockery\u201d of Britain\u2019s employment rights system after changing couriers\u2019 contracts rather than giving them the minimum wage and holiday pay, despite losing an employment tribunal case on the issue. The company, which has 3,500 self-employed couriers in the UK, said it had dropped an appeal against a ruling by the central London employment tribunal that it had unlawfully failed to award holiday pay to Mags Dewhurst and wrongly classed her as a self-employed freelancer. But CitySprint said it had changed contracts for all its cycle couriers. In January, the employment judge Joanna Wade described its contractual arrangements as contorted, indecipherable and window-dressing. The tribunal found Dewhurst should be classed as a \u201cworker\u201d and entitled to paid holiday and the national minimum wage under employment law. CitySprint argued it was an \u201cindividual appeal\u201d that did not apply to the other independent contractors. The employment lawyer Martin Warren of Eversheds Sutherland said the company\u2019s decision to apply the tribunal\u2019s findings to one member of staff was risky. \u201cWith the abolition of tribunal fees earlier this year, the chances of further waves of cases have probably increased. In any subsequent cases, the issue would not be a change in the paperwork. The tribunal would focus on whether there have been any operational changes on the ground,\u201d he said. CitySprint indicated that it had not changed the way it operated, but altered employment contracts to better reflect its relationship with cycle couriers, who it says have always been independent contractors. \u201cWe have updated our [cycle] courier tender documents to simplify the language in these, further clarifying the rights and flexibilities available to self-employed couriers who provide their services to us. We enjoy a great relationship with couriers, who continue to enjoy the freedom and flexibility of their current role,\u201d a spokesperson said. The company will pay Dewhurst about \u00a3200 in holiday pay owed from the period covered by the tribunal, but it is understood that she will not receive holiday pay in future under her new contract. Dewhurst told the Guardian: \u201cAs a result of my tribunal claim, CitySprint has forced everyone at the penalty of losing our jobs to sign new documents they say are contracts, but we work in exactly the same way as before \u2013 nothing has changed. It\u2019s a shame CitySprint would rather engage in legal shenanigans than pay me and my colleagues our holidays.\u201d The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which backed the case against CitySprint, accused the courier company of ignoring the employment tribunal ruling and said it planned to hold CitySprint to account. Jason Moyer-Lee, the IWGB general secretary, said: \u201cIt is outrageous that CitySprint is choosing to simply flout the ruling of the employment tribunal. They are making a mockery of our system of employment rights and protections and they will pay a price for doing so. It goes to show that in the absence of government enforcement of employment law, companies will try to act with total impunity.\u201d CitySprint\u2019s move comes after the Central Arbitration Committee, a body that resolves worker disputes, found that Deliveroo\u2019s takeaway couriers were self-employed contractors and therefore not entitled to holiday pay or the national minimum wage, because they had the right to allocate a substitute to do their work for them. CitySprint said it was awaiting the government\u2019s response to the Taylor review, which looked into ways to improve pay and conditions for those in the gig economy. The company said it hoped the government response would \u201cbring much-needed clarity and guidance in this important area for both organisations and individuals\u201d. The government has said it expects to respond to the review, which called for legal clarification of the definition of self-employment, by the end of this year. Employment law experts said CitySprint was likely to have decided to drop its appeal after Uber lost a similar appeal at the Employment Appeal Tribunal last week. The drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam won an employment tribunal case last year after arguing that they should be classified as workers, citing Uber\u2019s control over their working conditions. The taxi-hailing app has said it plans a further appeal. Similar cases have been successfully brought against Pimlico Plumbers and the Royal Mail subsidiary eCourier. Pimlico Plumbers\u2019 final appeal on the issue is to be heard at the supreme court in January.",

The taxi-hailing app has said it plans a further appeal.</p> <p>Similar cases have been successfully <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/10/pimlico-loses-appeal-against-plumbers-worker-status-in-gig-economy-case\">brought against Pimlico Plumbers</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/12/gig-economy-ecourier-admits-denying-courier-employment-benefits\">Royal Mail subsidiary eCourier</a>. Pimlico Plumbers\u2019 final appeal on the issue is to be heard at the supreme court in January.</p>",
