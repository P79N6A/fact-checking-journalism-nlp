      "bodyText": "In promoting his 10-year tax plan, Malcolm Turnbull suggested people want governments to undertake \u201clong term planning\u201d. However, a new research paper out this week from the IMF highlights how economies could be set for a major shake-up in the future and how sticking with the belief that better wages for workers comes from reducing company tax in order to spur capital investment is a rather wishful proposition. Economics research papers generally are not known for their optimism, but the IMF paper titled \u201cShould We Fear the Robot Revolution? (The Correct Answer is Yes)\u201d fairly hits you between the eyes with its pessimism. This research goes very much to the heart of primary political debate in this country about jobs, equality and the role of government. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday When Malcolm Turnbull took over the prime ministership he loved to talk about how it was the most exciting time to be alive \u2013 innovation was on the rise, agility was all the go! But for many workers it is a rather worrying time. In the past decade since the global financial crisis real wages have stalled, underemployment has risen, wage growth has plummeted, businesses have sought to move away from enterprise bargaining, and the growth areas have been mostly in lower-paid services sectors such as social care. And underneath all that is the feeling \u2013 perhaps overstated \u2013 that we are soon in danger of being replaced by robots. The IMF paper on the topic notes that there are essentially two camps on this issue \u2013 the first is optimistic and believes that, as in the past, greater automation will see some jobs lost, but the demand for many jobs \u2013 especially those \u201cthat place a premium on creativity, flexibility, and abstract reasoning\u201d \u2013 will grow and overall the economy is better off. The other side of the coin are those who note these are not your grandparents\u2019 robots we\u2019re talking about. These are robots that make use of AI in order to do work previously believed to be non-automatable precisely because it was seen as creative, flexible, or needing abstract reasoning. The paper considered a range of scenarios \u2013 from the more traditional one where robots replace only low skilled work to where robots are able to replicate a range of work and then a final one where robots \u201ccan do anything\u201d. And the results are not good for workers. Essentially the shift sees national income move from labour to capital \u2013 as the returns from investing in robots to do work previously done by people increase. They note that \u201cthe most common arguments for technology optimism do not stand up to scrutiny\u201d. Even in scenarios that fit with the more optimistic view of automation, the paper concludes that \u201cautomation is very good for growth and very bad for equality\u201d. The authors suggest that \u201cin scenarios where the traditional technology disappears and robots take over the automatable sector, the economy either ascends to a virtuous circle of ongoing endogenous growth or descends into a death spiral of perpetual contraction. Unfortunately, the odds strongly favor the death spiral\u201d. It\u2019s never good to read a report with \u201ceconomic growth\u201d and \u201cdeath spiral\u201d being used together. And one reason to fear the future is the past. Another report from the IMF this week looked at why some places in the US have had improved labour participation while elsewhere it has plummeted. It found that once you accounted for age, the overwhelming reason was automation: Automation and offshoring may have permanently displaced some workers, even if their effects on the economy as a whole were beneficial, through the creation of job opportunities in other sectors or productivity gains\u201d. It\u2019s that rather awful nexus \u2013 things that improve overall economic growth and productivity invariably come at the expense of specific groups of people, and the gains which flow through to everyone can take a very long time to eventuate. The authors looking at the benefits of increased robots concluded that the rise in automation causes real wages to fall in the short run but that they \u201ceventually rise\u201d due to increased demand for labour in work robots cannot do. But, they note bitterly, the \u201cshort run\u201d can \u201cconsume an entire working life\u201d and \u201ceventually\u201d could \u201ceasily take generations\u201d. It\u2019s why basing your economic policy on \u201clong-term\u201d gains can easily fool you into pursuing something of little worth. And why in a period where we have seen strong employment growth, but flat household income, talk of cutting company taxes to increase capital investment is not a formula that is going to bring much joy. Even the treasury\u2019s own research suggests the company tax cuts will cause real wages only to rise in the \u201clong term,\u201d at least 10 years after they have been introduced \u2013 at which point we may well wonder what jobs will be around to garner that growth. The most worrying part of the IMF paper is the authors have little sense that much can be done to ameliorate the problems. Yes, education can help, but even then the authors doubt a higher skilled labour force can offset the \u201chuge real wage cuts unskilled labour suffers and the decrease in labour\u2019s overall income\u201d. Similarly they note the proposal for a universal basic income has some merit but the problem is paying for it in a world where income is shifting from labour to capital. They note that \u201ccapital taxation is becoming more and more difficult with globalization and the increasing capital mobility\u201d. And it is also made more difficult when our government is following the lead of others to reduce the level of taxation that would be paid by those companies in the first place in order to encourage the investment that are causing so much worry for workers. It has long been assumed such policies would work out better for everyone in the end; the research this week shows that that has not be true in the past and is not likely to be so in the future. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "There is a comforting mainstream narrative which tells us that African nations, like the rest of the developing world, are doing just fine. Look past the terrorist incidents, the latest Ebola outbreak and areas of drought, and you will find that poverty is being alleviated and diseases confined to isolated pockets. A combination of western aid, Chinese investment and the rejuvenating application of neoliberal economic medicine in the guise of free trade has come to the rescue, this narrative runs, improving matters by measurable degrees. This draws on figures from the World Bank showing that in 1981 around 42% of the world\u2019s population was extremely poor, using $1.90 a day in 2011 prices as a yardstick. By 2013, that figure had fallen to 10.7%. An estimate by the bank suggests it fell further, to 9.1%, in 2016. Likewise, polio and other major diseases are in full retreat. But most of these gains have benefited the poor in Asia and Latin and South America, where governments of varying levels of stability have sought to raise living standards. In sub-Saharan Africa, the story is one of terrible and debilitating decline, such that in 2013 there were 389 million people living on less than $1.90 a day, which the World Bank says amounts to \u201cmore than all the other regions combined\u201d. Fast-rising populations across the region are one reason governments struggle to combat poverty. The other reason can be found in the pernicious activities of western companies, western governments and the Chinese state, which want to maintain access to important minerals and to make sure they stay as cheap as possible. The devious nature of the conspiracy to keep Africa poor has most recently been exposed by the work of journalists who have banded together as the Norbert Zongo Cell for Investigative Reporting in West Africa (Cenozo), named after the Burkinab\u00e9 newspaper editor murdered in 1998. In a report last week, it revealed how western banks and governments turn a blind eye to billions of pounds\u2019 worth of wealth, generated across west Africa, that is squirrelled away offshore, often out of sight of the tax authorities. Working with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which was behind the Panama Papers leaks, it details how Nigerian billionaire Sayyu Dantata bought six subsidiaries across the region from US oil firm Chevron. The $1bn deal would have been subject to multiple tax regimes depending on the laws of the countries involved. Tax experts working with the ICIJ say the transaction, at the very least, \u201cskilfully avoided the withholding tax regime\u201d. There is no suggestion Chevron or Dantata engaged in tax evasion or corrupt practices in relation to the transaction. But tax evasion on the continent is a colossal problem. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has said, the extent of tax evasion in the region is dramatic, with more than $50bn per year funnelled out through illicit flows \u2013 a sum more than all the aid the continent receives from individual countries and agencies. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, recently said that, after several years in the job, she had concluded that interventions by her agency should come with more strings attached, and one of the strings should be a demand for anti-corruption drives. Jason Hickel, in his new book The Divide, not only argues against what we might call the \u201cNiall Ferguson view\u201d that colonialisation, or at least the British empire, improved the lives of those it affected: he also rails against more recent attempts to show that trade and liberalisation are benefiting the poor. He uses research by the US-based campaign group Global Financial Integrity (GFI) and the Centre for Applied Research at the Norwegian School of Economics which shows that in 2012, the last year of recorded data, $3.3tn flowed out of developing-world countries. This contrasts with the $1.3tn \u2013 including all aid, investment and income from abroad \u2013 that flowed in. Totting up the net outflow of funds since 1980 delivers the alarming figure of $16.3tn, says Hickel, an anthropologist based at the London School of Economics. To get a sense of the scale, $16.3tn is only a couple of trillion short of total US GDP. Hickel, who will be discussing his book at the Also festival of ideas in Warwickshire next month, joins a growing number of academics who have argued that aid and investment, especially in Africa, is far outweighed by what is stolen. Unfortunately, economics teaching avoids discussing how the financial system operates with stolen money. It focuses instead on legitimate flows from trade. Hopefully these latest efforts will show that tax evasion is a huge issue beyond Europe and America\u2019s shores \u2013 and that agencies and governments have barely begun to tackle it.",

      "bodyText": "In one fell swoop DIY giant Homebase became the high street\u2019s latest pound shop last week after its Australian owner, Wesfarmers, offloaded the loss-making chain for a token sum to a restructuring firm. The deal is expected to trigger fresh pain on a high street that is already shedding stores and jobs at a faster rate than during the recession in 2009. Major high-street names including Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams, Topshop and House of Fraser are also struggling. On Friday the homewares chain Dunelm issued a profit warning, blaming \u201cchallenging\u201d conditions. So why is life so tough on the high street? Online rivals It is hardly a surprise that the high street is under pressure as the internet has hoovered up about a fifth of all retail spending, with non-food sales online rising by 7.5% in the past year. Now smartphones are ubiquitous, it is possible to buy a sofa on the bus, a designer handbag from the sofa or a new kitchen while in bed. The internet has made life challenging for retailers in a number of ways. Apart from directly diverting sales, it has given shoppers less reason to visit their high street, reducing small retailers\u2019 chances of drawing in passing trade, while the cost and complexity of building the infrastructure to deliver goods to homes efficiently has hit profits. As traditional retailers struggle to adapt, they are being pressed by online specialists, such as Asos, Amazon and Boohoo.com, unhindered by a long tail of outdated stores. The ease of comparing prices and accessing goods from around the world has given more options to those based in small towns who are no longer restricted to shopping local, making competition tougher than ever. The internet is also enabling savvy shoppers to trade goods among themselves much more easily. Whether it is bundles of baby clothes selling on Facebook, fashion fans searching for vintage on eBay or Etsy, or teenagers flogging their unwanted impulse purchases on fast-growing mobile app Depop, this market is on the rise. In the US, the fashion resale market, both on and offline, is expected to rise 13% between 2016 and 2021 to $33bn, and new specialist sites such as Hewi (Hardly Ever Worn It) and Vinted as well as Depop are also expected to drive growth in the UK. Rising costs As traditional retailers battle to fund adapting their businesses to cope with the shift to online shopping, they are being hit with a perfect storm of other cost rises. The fall in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote has pushed up the cost of sourcing goods abroad. The impending exit from the EU and lower value of sterling have also acted to push up wages in some areas as it has been more difficult to find skilled workers who have traditionally come from mainland Europe, such as van drivers. The rise in the legal minimum wage and imposition of the apprenticeship levy have also pushed up costs, as has a rise in business rates this year. While some businesses have seen a cut, and many small stores were protected, those in the south, particularly in London, have seen major rate rises. About 1,400 shops, pubs, restaurants and hotels received an average rise of almost \u00a350,000 according to property adviser Altus Group. Consumption fatigue After years of filling their wardrobes and homes with material possessions, Brits appear to have reached \u201cpeak stuff\u201d. Young people are now more likely to be renters rather than buyers, meaning they\u2019ve no yearning to fill a bottom drawer with household goods they may have to lug between short-term lets. Barclaycard data for last year reveals a 10% increase in spending on entertainment and an 11.4% rise in spending on telecoms, which of course doesn\u2019t include all those direct debits paying for long-term phone contracts. Entertainment, pubs and restaurant spending was all up in double-digit percentages last year, according to Barclaycard, but women\u2019s clothing spending was down. The latest data from Visa indicates that spending on household goods and clothing continues to fall, while restaurants, hotels, pubs and bars are still on the up. High-street decline Retailers are currently closing stores at a faster rate than during the recession, but despite the underlying issues being well rehearsed, no coherent plan has emerged to tackle high-street decline. Some 50,000 stores are deemed surplus to requirements and MPs have recently launched a fresh inquiry, with the goal of drawing up a vision of what high streets and town centres could look like by 2030. There is no shortage of brain power being devoted to this emotive subject; retail guru Bill Grimsey is currently leading a taskforce that is revisiting his influential 2013 review. But while MPs and retail experts bang their heads together, the pace of decline only accelerates. Last week Marks &amp; Spencer confirmed plans to close 100 of its traditional high-street stores by 2022 as sales move online. M&amp;S\u2019s predicament typifies that of large chains with long histories: stores opened on once-thriving high streets are now surrounded by discount stores and fast-food outlets. If shoppers have abandoned a high street and shops are ever more expensive to run, how can retailers be expected to stay? Bad management Retail executives have plenty of excuses up their sleeves \u2013 ranging from the weather to declining footfall and the rise of the internet \u2013 for falling sales but no one admits to lacking skills and vision. The world wide web has been around for more than 25 years so retail bosses have had plenty of time to get used to the idea and adapt their businesses. Nearly 50% of Next\u2019s \u00a34bn sales are rung up online, whereas last week Marks &amp; Spencer admitted that despite spending the best part of \u00a3400m on its website operation, it is still too clunky and needs more money thrown at it. There are clear instances of bad management heightening the pressure created by the structural change bearing down on the high street: Homebase, which employs more than 11,000 people, was sold for just \u00a31 after its new Australian owners, Wesfarmers, made terrible decisions that turned a profitable business into a massive loss-maker; the struggling Mothercare chain can no longer persuade new parents to shop there despite around 1,900 babies being born every day. Analysts level claims of inexperience at the bosses of retail chains such as House of Fraser, which has joined a long list of household names that includes Carpetright, New Look and Mothercare resorting to company voluntary arrangements (CVA), a form of insolvency, to jettison their weakest stores. Spending squeeze Consumers have just escaped a long period of falling real income and the scars are now becoming visible on the high street. Last year saw inflation rise to 3%, while wages remained stuck between 2% and 2.5%. According to pay experts, most wage bargaining deals signed last year were nearer 2%. That made for a significant fall in inflation-adjusted earnings and depressed the disposable incomes of most shoppers. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way, with employment at record levels and unemployment so low that it has dropped to levels last seen in the 1970s. What many economists depict as full employment was meant to send wage rates soaring. However, Brexit uncertainty \u2013 and the transformation of working life following the rise of self-employment, part-time jobs and zero-hours contracts \u2013 more than offset the pressure from rising vacancy rates to send household incomes falling backwards. A lack of investment by British business has also played its part, keeping productivity and wage rises low. To maintain their standard of living, consumers have ramped up their borrowing, especially to buy cars and other big-ticket items. They have also run down their savings. The hope is that falling inflation this year will allow real incomes to rise again and a credit binge can be avoided. That\u2019s what most forecasters expect, though the twists and turns of Brexit could wreck that prediction.",

    "webTitle": "Starbucks to tell staff 'prejudice is deeply rooted' at anti-bias training", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Starbucks is closing more than 8,000 of its coffee shops across the US on Tuesday for a four-hour, anti-bias training session \u2013 almost two months since an employee at a Philadelphia location called the police on two black men accused of trespassing as they waited, without making a purchase, to be joined for a meeting. Since the incident, which sparked protests and threats of a boycott against a chain known for actively promoting a diverse workforce and taking liberal stands on issues such as same-sex marriage, senior executives have repeatedly apologized. The company reached a settlement with Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, the two men who were detained, in which they asked for a symbolic $1 for themselves and Starbucks agreed to fund a new community youth program. The company also issued new guidelines, requiring stores to allow customers to linger and use the restrooms, irrespective of whether they buy anything. That prompted a backlash from some Starbucks customers, who said they feared the outlets would become a place for homeless people to hang out. Starbucks later clarified the new policy, saying non-paying customers would be allowed to use the stores so long as they do not exhibit disruptive behavior, such as \u201csmoking, drug or alcohol use, improper use of restrooms, and sleeping\u201d. The company also clarified instances when employees should call 911. But this weekend\u2019s seminars are by far the most extensive retraining measures the coffee giant has undertaken. Last week, it offered a preview, including a five-minute video and accompanying statement, of what its 175,000 employees can expect. Starbucks has not offered an estimate of what it will lose in sales during the afternoon closing, but the Philadelphia incident reportedly had a noticeable negative effect on consumer approval. In a corporate video to be shown to staff during the training, the chief executive, Kevin Johnson, reportedly tells employees that \u201cthe issue of racial bias and discrimination isn\u2019t just about us as a company, it is about us as a country. Prejudice in public accommodation is deeply rooted in America.\u201d While acknowledging the difficulty employees sometimes have with customers\u2019 anti-social behavior, Johnson says, \u201cmy hope in gathering us is that Starbucks can become a place of welcoming, of warmth and of inclusion for all.\u201d But anti-bias training experts are divided over the efficacy of a single seminar in correcting racial and gender biases. \u201cThe marketplace should be the place where we leave baggage at home,\u201d said Rodney Sampson, chief executive of consultancy Opportunity Hub and author of Kingonomics, a study of economic diversity drawn from the teachings of Dr Martin Luther King. \u201cI applaud what Starbucks is trying to do but I\u2019m not sure if one day, or even one year, of training will have an impact.\u201d The Philadelphia incident and others like it elsewhere speak to deeply set racial biases, Sampson said, which require additional cultural context and competency to result in effective training. \u201cStarbucks has the opportunity to make incredible investment across its brand, in human resources, in procurement and innovation. There\u2019s got to be a deeper approach than just a day of training. But this sends a big message to companies that aren\u2019t even considering how to be more diverse, equitable and inclusive,\u201d he added. According to Nathalie Molina Ni\u00f1o, who has studied and lectured on both gender and racial diversity studies, Starbucks has spent time and resources in achieving greater diversity but needs to take a holistic view of the problem. \u201cBias training is largely unsuccessful in isolation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis has to be part of a multi-tiered strategy that attacks the problem from several different angles.

      "body": "<p>Starbucks is closing more than 8,000 of its coffee shops across the US on Tuesday for a four-hour, anti-bias training session \u2013 almost two months since an employee at a Philadelphia location called the police on two black men accused of trespassing as they waited, without making a purchase, to be joined for a meeting. </p> <p>Since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/16/arrest-of-two-black-men-at-starbucks-for-trespassing-sparks-protests\">incident</a>, which sparked protests and threats of a boycott against a chain known for actively promoting a diverse workforce and taking liberal stands on issues such as same-sex marriage, senior executives have repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/02/black-men-arrested-starbucks-settlement\">apologized</a>.<br></p> <p>The company reached a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/02/black-men-arrested-starbucks-settlement\">settlement</a> with Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, the two men who were detained, in which they asked for a symbolic $1 for themselves and Starbucks agreed to fund a new community youth program. The company also issued new <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/20/new-starbucks-policy-allows-nonpaying-guests-use-restrooms\">guidelines</a>, requiring stores to allow customers to linger and use the restrooms, irrespective of whether they buy anything. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top US stories every morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4152\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Guardian Today - US edition\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of editors' picks and the biggest headlines each morning.\" data-form-campaign-code=\"US_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"We will send you our picks of the most important headlines.\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to receive the top US stories every morning </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That prompted a backlash from some Starbucks customers, who said they feared the outlets would become a place for homeless people to hang out. Starbucks later clarified the new policy, saying non-paying customers would be allowed to use the stores so long as they do not exhibit disruptive behavior, such as \u201csmoking, drug or alcohol use, improper use of restrooms, and sleeping\u201d. The company also clarified instances <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/starbucks-has-new-guidelines-for-when-employees-should-call-911/\">when employees should call 911</a>. </p> <p>But this weekend\u2019s seminars are by far the most extensive retraining measures the coffee giant has undertaken. Last week, it offered a preview, including a five-minute video and accompanying <a href=\"https://news.starbucks.com/news/starbucks-curriculum-preview-for-may-29\">statement</a>, of what its 175,000 employees can expect. </p> <p> </p> <p>Starbucks has not offered an estimate of what it will lose in sales during the afternoon closing, but the Philadelphia incident reportedly had a noticeable negative <a href=\"http://www.brandindex.com/article/starbucks-hits-lowest-perception-mark-25-years-after-philadelphia-incident\">effect</a> on consumer approval. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/20/new-starbucks-policy-allows-nonpaying-guests-use-restrooms\">New Starbucks policy allows non-paying guests to sit in cafes and use restrooms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a corporate video to be shown to staff during the training, the chief executive, Kevin Johnson, reportedly tells employees that \u201cthe issue of racial bias and discrimination isn\u2019t just about us as a company, it is about us as a country. Prejudice in public accommodation is deeply rooted in America.\u201d</p> <p>While acknowledging the difficulty employees sometimes have with customers\u2019 anti-social behavior, Johnson says, \u201cmy hope in gathering us is that Starbucks can become a place of welcoming, of warmth and of inclusion for all.\u201d</p> <p>But anti-bias training experts are divided over the efficacy of a single seminar in correcting racial and gender biases.</p> <p>\u201cThe marketplace should be the place where we leave baggage at home,\u201d said Rodney Sampson, chief executive of consultancy Opportunity Hub and author of <a href=\"http://kingonomics.net/\">Kingonomics</a>, a study of economic diversity drawn from the teachings of Dr Martin Luther King. </p> <p>\u201cI applaud what Starbucks is trying to do but I\u2019m not sure if one day, or even one year, of training will have an impact.\u201d <br></p> <p>The Philadelphia incident and others like it elsewhere speak to deeply set racial biases, Sampson said, which require additional cultural context and competency to result in effective training. </p> <p>\u201cStarbucks has the opportunity to make incredible investment across its brand, in human resources, in procurement and innovation.
