      "body": "<p>Australia and China are widely expected to announce a free trade agreement (FTA) in the next week on or before Monday, when the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, addresses parliament in Canberra. </p> <p>If it comes off, it will mean the Abbott government has completed bilateral agreements with China, Korea and Japan in one year, albeit finishing deals started by previous governments.</p> <p>While the FTA has been nearly 10 years in the making \u2013 negotiations began in 2005 \u2013 Tony Abbott showed his hand after he came to government by declaring that he wanted the negotiations done within the year. </p> <p>Labor\u2019s trade spokeswoman, Penny Wong, the Greens and others, such as Australian Industry Group\u2019s Innes Willox, have urged the government not to rush into a deal for the sake of a self-imposed deadline. Willox has said the AIG welcomes a good deal, not just \u201cany deal\u201d. </p> <p>Wong used another house metaphor to get the point across: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to sell your house ... and you tell the market that you want to sell it in a year, that isn\u2019t the best negotiating position.\u201d </p> <p>Negotiators, particularly in the agricultural sector, have been looking closely at the 2008 <a href=\"http://www.chinafta.govt.nz/index.php\">China New Zealand trade agreement</a>, which is considered the basis for any free trade agreement.

Labor has said it would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/nov/07/tony-abbott-speeds-up-free-trade-with-china-but-labor-demands-good-deal\">endorse the deal</a> only if it retained labour market testing requirements for temporary migration to ensure business is not allowed to import workers on lower wages and conditions.</p> <p>The trade minister, Andrew Robb, said there was \u201cno prospect\u201d for lower-wage workers coming into Australia where skills currently receive a certain wage level.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got protocols in Australia for people who are employed in all sorts of areas as to wage levels that are there by law and Australian law will apply,\u201d Robb said. </p> <p>He did foreshadow that all Australia bilateral trade agreements have covered \u201cmovement of natural persons, particularly things such as mutual recognition, easier recognition of skill sets and whatever, so again those issues have been under consideration\u201d.</p> <h2>Investment</h2> <p>Like the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/trans-pacific-partnership-a-guide-to-the-most-contentious-issues\">Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement</a>, there has been much conjecture as to whether the China FTA will include the controversial Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) clause, which grants foreign companies the right to sue the government under international law. This is particularly controversial as Australia <a href=\"http://www.ag.gov.au/internationalrelations/internationallaw/pages/tobaccoplainpackaging.aspx\">faces a legal case by Philip Morris International</a> based on a Hong Kong trade treaty over Australia\u2019s tobacco plain packaging laws, even though the company already lost the case in the Australian high court. </p> <p>Two weeks ago, a former Australian ambassador to China, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickbisley/status/527367182884171776\">Geoff Raby, predicted</a> China would want an ISDS and Australia would grant it. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said rushing the deal would have huge ramifications for Australia\u2019s interests.</p> <p>\u201cHaving the dangerous and undemocratic ISDS provisions in the China deal would mean subjugating the Australian legal and parliamentary system to Chinese state-owned enterprises and shady international arbitration panels,\u201d Whish-Wilson said.</p> <p>\u201cIf the Foreign Investment Review Board [Firb] process was exposed to ISDS then we would lose control of our ability to block investments that weren\u2019t in the national interest.\u201d</p> <p>The government is reportedly considering granting greater access for Chinese investors generally in return for greater access to Chinese markets. </p> <h2>State-owned enterprises</h2> <p>China is looking for better treatment for investment by Chinese state-owned enterprises, which have a tighter review criteria under the Firb. Robb has lauded the role of foreign investment, including by state-owned enterprises, in the Australian economy.</p> <p>\u201cThere is significant state-owned investment now,\u201d said Robb. \u201cIt\u2019s been to the great benefit to Australia back over the last 14 years. For goodness sake, it got us through the global financial crisis and has been an enormous contributor to wealth in Australia.\u201d</p> <h2>Minerals</h2> <p>The Australian minerals council wants the immediate elimination of tariffs on Australian exports of minerals and energy commodities to China, valued at $15.5bn annually. These tariffs range between 1.5% and 10%, and if applied at current rates they add nearly $590m in costs to the bilateral minerals and energy trade this year.</p> <h2>Red meat</h2> <p>The National Farmers Federation\u2019s Brent Finlay is hoping for gains in the Chinese market for Australian red meat, including beef, lamb and mutton. A<a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/foreign-affairs/china-deal-on-cattle-exports/story-fn59nm2j-1227115289349\"> live export </a>deal separate to the FTA is in the wind, which has the potential for 1m live cattle to be shipped to China each year.

Last year Australia\u2019s total live exports were 1.1m. Robb said the live export deal and the free trade agreement were feeding off each other as they worked towards a conclusion on both deals. <a href=\"http://www.mla.com.au/Prices-and-markets/Overseas-markets/Market-access/Beef\">Australian beef </a>currently attracts a tariff of up to 25%, while <a href=\"http://www.mla.com.au/Prices-and-markets/Overseas-markets/Market-access/Sheepmeat\">sheep meat</a> attracts tariffs of up to 15%. </p> <h2>Horticulture</h2> <p>The horticulture industry is looking for the removal of tariffs from fruit and vegetables. Fresh vegetables attract a tariff of about 10%. Claire McClelland, the assistant manager of export development for Ausveg, which represents 9,000 vegetable growers, said it was hoping for a tariff reduction to zero, similar to the China-NZ FTA which achieved zero tariffs in four years. Once a removal of tariffs is achieved, the industry is hoping to determine protocols to allow producers to send direct to China. The protocols govern how the produce is treated, and if not handled correctly can mean the produce is rejected. </p> <h2>Sugar </h2> <p>Sugar growers appear set to lose out in the China FTA due to a reluctance by the Chinese government to put Chinese sugar producers offside. Warren Males, economist for industry body Canegrowers, said he remains \u201chopeful and optimistic\u201d that there will be some inclusions for sugar growers to take advantage of some markets, though he would not elaborate on the details. If Australia did win a relaxation on tariffs and quotas, we would be the first country to do so, which indicates the magnitude of the task. China places a 15% duty on the first 1.94m tonnes and then a 50% duty on anything above the quota. China imports 4m tonnes of sugar, of which 200,000 tonnes come from Australia. But the market is growing rapidly as the Chinese diet moves closer to the western diet. China consumes 12-13kg of sugar per head per year, compared with the Asian average of 20kg and the Australian average of 50kg.</p> <h2>Services</h2> <p>Australian service sectors are keen to win access to the Chinese market. One sector waiting eagerly for news of the China FTA is the education industry, which considers Australia\u2019s student visa application fees a significant hurdle for Chinese high school and tertiary students to study abroad. Australian non-refundable visa application fees cost $535 each, with no guarantee of a place. This compares with A$200 in New Zealand, A$150 in Canada and A$350 in the United States. If students want to continue to study in another Australian course once here, they pay another A$700 extension fee. Phil Honeywood, chief executive officer of the International Education Association of Australia, said fees played into the decision making process of overseas students. The association would also like the see more places for paid and unpaid internships and an acknowledgment that Australian and Chinese students, travelling both ways, are a low immigration risk and should be treated as such by both governments.</p> <p>After 10 years of negotiations, even when the deal is done, it still needs the approval of parliament, including the Senate, which may be the government\u2019s biggest challenge yet. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Australia and China are widely expected to announce a free trade agreement (FTA) in the next week on or before Monday, when the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, addresses parliament in Canberra. If it comes off, it will mean the Abbott government has completed bilateral agreements with China, Korea and Japan in one year, albeit finishing deals started by previous governments. While the FTA has been nearly 10 years in the making \u2013 negotiations began in 2005 \u2013 Tony Abbott showed his hand after he came to government by declaring that he wanted the negotiations done within the year. Labor\u2019s trade spokeswoman, Penny Wong, the Greens and others, such as Australian Industry Group\u2019s Innes Willox, have urged the government not to rush into a deal for the sake of a self-imposed deadline. Willox has said the AIG welcomes a good deal, not just \u201cany deal\u201d. Wong used another house metaphor to get the point across: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to sell your house ... and you tell the market that you want to sell it in a year, that isn\u2019t the best negotiating position.\u201d Negotiators, particularly in the agricultural sector, have been looking closely at the 2008 China New Zealand trade agreement, which is considered the basis for any free trade agreement. It provided big wins for New Zealand dairy, for example, with a more than tenfold increase in exports to China. But in recent days the government has been talking less about the agricultural sector and more about the \u201cservices\u201d industries, such as tourism, finance, education, law and accounting, as the big winners in the trade deal. \u201cThese agreements today are not just about trade, they\u2019re also about services, and there are tremendous opportunities for Australian law firms, accounting firms, educational providers and others to make more of this great market and, likewise, there are opportunities for Chinese people in Australia,\u201d Abbott said. As with all trade agreements, the negotiations are secret, but here are some of the sticking points. Labour The Chinese government is seeking concessions for Chinese workers on Chinese investment projects in Australia. Labor has said it would endorse the deal only if it retained labour market testing requirements for temporary migration to ensure business is not allowed to import workers on lower wages and conditions. The trade minister, Andrew Robb, said there was \u201cno prospect\u201d for lower-wage workers coming into Australia where skills currently receive a certain wage level. \u201cWe\u2019ve got protocols in Australia for people who are employed in all sorts of areas as to wage levels that are there by law and Australian law will apply,\u201d Robb said. He did foreshadow that all Australia bilateral trade agreements have covered \u201cmovement of natural persons, particularly things such as mutual recognition, easier recognition of skill sets and whatever, so again those issues have been under consideration\u201d. Investment Like the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement, there has been much conjecture as to whether the China FTA will include the controversial Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) clause, which grants foreign companies the right to sue the government under international law. This is particularly controversial as Australia faces a legal case by Philip Morris International based on a Hong Kong trade treaty over Australia\u2019s tobacco plain packaging laws, even though the company already lost the case in the Australian high court. Two weeks ago, a former Australian ambassador to China, Geoff Raby, predicted China would want an ISDS and Australia would grant it. The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said rushing the deal would have huge ramifications for Australia\u2019s interests. \u201cHaving the dangerous and undemocratic ISDS provisions in the China deal would mean subjugating the Australian legal and parliamentary system to Chinese state-owned enterprises and shady international arbitration panels,\u201d Whish-Wilson said. \u201cIf the Foreign Investment Review Board [Firb] process was exposed to ISDS then we would lose control of our ability to block investments that weren\u2019t in the national interest.\u201d The government is reportedly considering granting greater access for Chinese investors generally in return for greater access to Chinese markets. State-owned enterprises China is looking for better treatment for investment by Chinese state-owned enterprises, which have a tighter review criteria under the Firb. Robb has lauded the role of foreign investment, including by state-owned enterprises, in the Australian economy. \u201cThere is significant state-owned investment now,\u201d said Robb. \u201cIt\u2019s been to the great benefit to Australia back over the last 14 years. For goodness sake, it got us through the global financial crisis and has been an enormous contributor to wealth in Australia.\u201d Minerals The Australian minerals council wants the immediate elimination of tariffs on Australian exports of minerals and energy commodities to China, valued at $15.5bn annually.

Robb said the live export deal and the free trade agreement were feeding off each other as they worked towards a conclusion on both deals. Australian beef currently attracts a tariff of up to 25%, while sheep meat attracts tariffs of up to 15%. Horticulture The horticulture industry is looking for the removal of tariffs from fruit and vegetables. Fresh vegetables attract a tariff of about 10%. Claire McClelland, the assistant manager of export development for Ausveg, which represents 9,000 vegetable growers, said it was hoping for a tariff reduction to zero, similar to the China-NZ FTA which achieved zero tariffs in four years.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has lost a high court challenge against a Tesco ad campaign claiming its own-label goods were cheaper. The ruling comes as the new chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, Mike Coupe, prepares to outline his plan to turn around sales amid a bitter industry price war. Sales at Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Morrisons are falling. The supermarkets have been forced to cut prices as shoppers tighten their belts amid growing competition from the German discounters Aldi and Lidl as well as lower fuel prices and a fall in the cost of fresh produce owing to good summer weather. On Monday, Aldi told David Cameron as he visited the company\u2019s UK headquarters that the plans it announced in the summer to spend \u00a3600m on doubling its stores to 1,000 by 2022 would lead to the creation of 35,000 new jobs. The prime minister said the retailer\u2019s expansion was \u201cgood news for our economy\u201d. But Sainsbury\u2019s will highlight on Wednesday the pain Aldi\u2019s expansion is causing the traditional supermarkets when Coupe is expected to announce he will lower dividend payments to shareholders to fund price cuts. He has already dropped Tesco from Sainsbury\u2019s Brand Match price comparison scheme, which now only compares prices with Asda, and halved the number of points shoppers can earn in the Nectar loyalty card scheme. Losing the court battle over the Tesco ad campaign makes life tougher for Coupe as the wider adoption of ethical standards such as Fairtrade by Sainsbury\u2019s are a key part of the supermarket\u2019s attempt to mark itself out from generally cheaper rivals. The strategy helped it to win sales last year during the horsemeat scandal. The supermarket claimed that Tesco\u2019s Price Promise campaign misled shoppers by failing to point out that many of Sainsbury\u2019s own-label products have superior ethical or provenance standards. Its claim was supported by evidence from ethical trading accreditation bodies including Fairtrade, the RSPCA\u2019s Freedom Food initiative and the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). But both the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and the watchdog\u2019s independent reviewer, Sir Hayden Phillips, concluded that Tesco could legitimately compare the price of goods such as teabags, haddock fillets and ham because they were \u201csufficiently interchangeable\u201d for the average consumer. ASA and Phillips said the essential feature being compared in the adverts was price and not quality, provenance or ethical treatment of suppliers. Sainsbury\u2019s went to the high court to try to win a judicial review of the independent reviewer\u2019s assessment but on Monday, Justice Wilkie ruled that the independent reviewer \u201cDid not \u2026 err in law or act irrationally\u201d. The ruling supported the reviewer\u2019s conclusion that \u201cSainsbury\u2019s can be right, that non-price elements of products are material to many customers, but that does not mean that the [ASA is] wrong to conclude that they were not material or essential or indeed important to this particular comparison\u201d. A Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cThis and the previous rulings by the ASA and independent reviewer demonstrate that Price Promise makes fair and reasonable comparisons between our branded and own brand products and those of our competitors.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s said it would consider its options following the ruling. A spokesperson said: \u201cWhilst we respect the court\u2019s decision that the independent reviewer acted lawfully when adjudicating our complaint against Tesco, we continue to believe that it is fundamentally misleading for customers if price comparison schemes are inconsistent in taking into account provenance, quality and whether products are Fairtrade or sustainably sourced. These values continue to be at the heart of our business and it will be for customers to reach their own verdict on this issue.\u201d In a note previewing the supermarket chain\u2019s half year results and strategic review on Wednesday, David McCarthy, an analyst at HSBC, said he expected profits to be down 7%. \u201cWe expect management to distance itself from price wars, but it Tesco improves prices and quality, then Sainsbury\u2019s will be strategically threatened through its lack of relative scale. Even if only a minority of customers are price sensitive, then losing a proportion of these will have disproportionate impact on profits,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 November to correct the name of the Advertising Standards Authority \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

      "bodyText": "In most places the news that you\u2019ve struck oil would be cause to crack open the champagne. But not in the Canary Islands where Spain\u2019s biggest oil company Repsol is due to begin drilling off Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. \u201cOur wealth is in our climate, our sky, our sea and the archipelago\u2019s extraordinary biodiversity and landscape,\u201d the Canary Islands president, Paulino Rivero, said. \u201cIts value is that it\u2019s natural and this is what attracts tourism. Oil is incompatible with tourism and a sustainable economy.\u201d Rivero, a former primary school teacher, is on a crusade against oil and he is not alone. Protest marches have drawn as many as 200,000 of the islands\u2019 2 million inhabitants on to the streets. The regional government planned to consolidate public opinion with a referendum on 23 November. Voters were to be asked: \u201cDo you believe the Canaries should exchange its environmental and tourism model for oil and gas exploration?\u201d As with the weekend\u2019s scheduled referendum on Catalan independence, the Madrid government contrived to have the plebiscite banned as unconstitutional and Rivero has now commissioned a private poll he hopes will demonstrate the strength of public opinion. \u201cThe banning of the referendum reveals a huge weakness in the system,\u201d said Rivero. \u201cYou have to listen to the people. There\u2019s a serious discrepancy between what people here want and what the Spanish government wants. You are allowed to hold consultations under the Spanish constitution and what we wanted to do was completely legal. The problem we have is that some government departments have too close a relationship with Repsol.\u201d Repsol is flush with cash after settling a long dispute with Argentina and is keen to develop what may be the country\u2019s biggest oilfield after winning permission to drill in August. The company believes the fields may contain as much as 2.2bn barrels of oil and is investing \u20ac7.5bn to explore two sites about 40 miles (60km) east of Fuerteventura. If its estimates are correct, the wells could produce around 110,000 barrels a day for 10 years, equivalent to 10% of Spain\u2019s oil needs. Spain, which has never had a wealth of natural resources, currently imports 99% of its oil at a cost of around \u20ac40bn a year. Drilling in the area has been held up for more than a decade by environmental challenges and delays by successive governments, but Repsol has said it expects to begin work before the end of the year. The company claims it has offered every guarantee that the work will be carried out safely and with respect for the environment and has set up an \u20ac80m contingency fund for compensation in the event of accidents. Rivero is not convinced. \u201cWhen we look at the development of Argentina or Mexico or Nigeria we see that the local people don\u2019t benefit much from oil,\u201d he says. \u201cFurthermore, the oil here is in very deep water which hugely increases the risks, as we saw with the environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.\u201d The Spanish government says it cannot pass up on the possibility of finding oil and has issued licences for conventional exploration as well as fracking. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Soria, the minister for industry, energy and tourism, said last month that \u201cSpain cannot afford the luxury of not finding out whether we have hydrocarbons.\u201d Speaking at a conference under the slogan \u201cReindustrialise to win\u201d, Soria said that \u201cwe spend \u20ac100m a day on gas and oil that our industry needs. We all want our industry to be more competitive and for that to happen we need cheaper energy.\u201d Rivero concedes that there is a conflict between what the Canaries want and the Spanish national interest. \u201cAs president of the Canaries, my first responsibility is to protect the Canaries\u2019 interests,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no benefit for us. It presents risks to tourism, the environment, fishing, agriculture and to the desalination of seawater. When we weigh up what we have to gain and what we stand to lose, we don\u2019t gain anything. Repsol is the one who profits from this.\u201d Rivero\u2019s principal argument is that, the risk of oil spills aside, the oil will in due course be exhausted whereas tourism gives the islands a sustainable economic base. The tourist industry, which attracts 12m people to the islands, is worth \u20ac13bn a year, 32% of GDP. The islands, where 40% of land is protected, boast three Unesco world heritage sites and are a major ecotourist destination. As well as hiking amid unspoilt landscape, visitors can opt for the Loro Parque on Tenerife, the rainforest of La Gomera, or volcano treks on Lanzarote, among other attractions. Another issue is unemployment, currently running at 33% in the Canaries, nearly 10% above the Spanish national average. Rivero remains unconvinced that the oil business will make much of a dent on the jobless total. \u201cRepsol says it may create 3,000 jobs but in Lanzarote and Fuerteventura alone more than 50,000 people work in tourism and in the Canaries it\u2019s more than 400,000,\u201d he says. \u201cThe oil industry will not complement what we already have. In fact, it will impede it.\u201d Despite the setback in the high court and the determination of the central government to explore all energy opportunities, Rivero remains unbowed. \u201cWe in the Canaries do not accept being treated like a colony, like something from another century when the Europeans pillaged Africa\u2019s resources,\u201d he said. \u201cRepsol thinks everything has a price but they\u2019re not going to buy the Canaries. We won\u2019t bow down. We may lose a battle but we\u2019ll win the war.\u201d",

Full coverage here: Ed Miliband speaks at the CBI annual conference: Politics Live blog Discount supermarket chain Aldi has announced that it will create 35,000 new jobs in the UK, over the next eight years. The employment splurge comes as Aldi spends \u00a3600m on expanding its store footprint, opening another 550 outlets by 2022 (which we\u2019ve known about for some time) The plan was announced as Prime Minister David Cameron visits Aldi UK\u2019s Warwickshire headquarters: Press Association has more details: The company\u2019s grocery market share now stands at 4.8% following the rapid growth of discounters in the UK, led by Aldi and German rival Lidl. Aldi opened 42 new stores last year and is on course to open another 54 this year, with another 60-65 new stores planned to open in 2015. The Aldi group now has more than 7,000 stores across three continents. Its job plans in the UK include the creation of at least one apprenticeship position per store, per year. This will be supported by a new academy located at Aldi\u2019s office and distribution centre in Bolton, which is due to open in March. Chancellor George Osborne said: \u201cIt is fantastic to see great success stories like Aldi creating jobs and increasing opportunities for young people.\u201d Worth noting that Aldi does not appear on the list of 1,000 firms paying the Living Wage..... Time for a recap... Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu has made a passionate plea to businesses to end Britain\u2019s income inequality. Employers who can afford to pay the living wage \u201cshould just get on with it\u201d, Sentamu, who chaired the living wage commission, told the CBI\u2019s annual conference. He told business leaders that: \u201cWork must pay but not pay poverty wages....\u201d. \u201cThe economic recovery provides the perfect opportunity for us to ensure many more people are paid a living wage.\u201d Sentamu also had little time for the suggestion that firms can\u2019t afford to pay the living wage (\u00a39.15 per hour in London and \u00a37.85 outside the capital) \u201cMost businesses, sorry to say, they can afford to pay the living wage and they should just get on with it. I\u2019m sorry, they should just get on with it,\u201d Full highlights start here. The latest European economic data has shown that the eurozone economy remains weak. Fears have heightened that Italy is back in recession, after industrial production slid by 0.9% month-on-month in September. The last three months has been the weakest quarter since the end of 2012. The picture is no better in Greece -- where industrial production is down 5.1% in the last 12 months. The country has also fallen deeper into deflation, with prices down 1.7% year-on-year. And investor confidence in the eurozone remains weak, despite rising for the first time in three months. The day began with Bank of England governor Mark Carney warning that international regulators need to work more closely to stamp out bad behaviour in the banking sector. Carney (in his role has chairman of the Financial Stability Board) also announced new proposals to make globally systemic banks hold more capital to cover losses. A \u201cwatershed moment\u201d, he claims. And in the markets, Serco shares remains at a 10-year low after slumping 30% following its latest profit warning, and plans to raise more cash from shareholders. Over in Moscow, the Russian central bank has been counting the cost of the Ukraine crisis, and the decline in the oil price. And it\u2019s not cheap -- the bank has slashed its growth forecasts, expecting growth of just 0.3% this year, nothing at all next year, and just 0.1% in 2016. That forecast of near-stagnation is based on Western government\u2019s keeping sanctions on Russia until 2017. Reminder: our politics liveblogger Andrew Sparrow is covering the main action from the CBI conference here: Cameron and Miliband speak at the CBI annual conference: Politics Live blog The Labour leader is due in under two hours, I believe. We\u2019ve already heard from the prime minister - here\u2019s a video clip: The Archbishop of York may have won some converts to his call for businesses to fight inequality and embrace the living wage (see 12.08pm onwards for details) CBI deputy director general Katja Hall closed today\u2019s debate with a call to action, she paraphrases Sentamu and tells the business audience: \u201cYou are the gatekeepers of opportunity, so go out and do your bit\u201d. More stirring words from the Archbishop of York to Britain\u2019s business leaders: CBI deputy director-general Katja Hall has asked Dr John Sentamu what businesses can do if they cannot afford to pay the living wage. The Archbishop of York starts off sympathetic, before turning to the majority of firms that can, in his view, afford to pay the living wage - which just as a reminder is a voluntary pay rate set to provide a decent standard of living. It is \u00a39.15 in London and \u00a37.85 outside the capital. Sentamu says: \u201cI would rather businesses stay in business than go bust because they have to pay the living wage.\u201d He concedes for some retailers, for example, it is hard to pay the living wage. But the archbishop adds: \u201cI still think they could engage in what you call social mobility.\u201d Then the heart of the matter: \u201cMost businesses. sorry to say, they can afford to pay the living wage and they should just get on with it. I\u2019m sorry, they should just get on with it.\u201d Government also has a role in boosting pay, not just employers, Sentamu goes on to say. He uses the example of contracts awarded to the private sector by the public in social care. He also says taxes must be set so \u201cthat those who are doing the right thing are not being penalised.\u201d Back at the CBI\u2019s annual conference, Dr John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York is introducing a debate under the banner: \u2018Fair for All\u2019 not a \u2018Free for All\u2019. He warns that Britain is at risk of becoming a divided country of haves and have-nots living in parallel worlds, Katie Allen reports. Sentamu begins by highlighting growing inequality, the number of people in work living in poverty and his push for the living wage to be paid by all who can afford it. Sentamu, who headed the living wage commission, describes what he sees as \u201cflaws in the practice of free market economies\u201d with \u201cno mechanism to reduce disparities between the haves and have-nots.\u201d Economic models, he says, are based on idealism and dogma and on projecting the future but in reality the future is an unknown. He highlights the latest research on low pay by consultants KPMG last week that found a fifth of workers are on less than the living wage. He lauds CBI members for getting behind the living wage, which now has more than 1,000 accredited employers. But he flags up the higher likelihood that the young and women will be trapped in low pay. \u201cBut there is still a long way to go. Recent research shows there are a number of group that are still suffering disproportionately,\u201d. The Archbishop also has strong words of warning on pay: \u201cBritain is at risk of becoming a place where the haves and have-nots live in separate parallel worlds... Income inequality is a stain on all our consciences.\u201d On a slightly brighter note, eurozone investor confidence has stopped falling, but remains close to an 18-month low. The monthly measure of investor morale, from the Sentix research group, came in at minus 11.9 this month, up from minus 13.7 in October. Sentix says the recent \u201cstrong downtrend\u201d of falling economic expectations has now stopped. Investors are more confident about future prospects, following the latest announcements by the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank. However, their assessment of the current situation worsened again. Sentix says fears of a global downturn have eased. Nevertheless, it remains unclear if the current month\u2019s rise in economic expectations is just a one-off or a more important turn to the positive. The sentix data justify cautious optimism, but not more than that. And another: (see 9.30am for details of today\u2019s disappointing data) Hat-tip to the Telegraph\u2019s Ambrose Evans-Pritchard for tweeting this chart showing how Italy\u2019s industrial production has deteriorated in recent months: Another reason to worry about the eurozone -- Italian banks have reported that bad debts are up by almost a fifth in the last year. The amount of non-performing loans within the Italian banking sector rose by 19.7% year-on-year in September, to \u20ac176.85bn. That suggests the weak Italian economy is taking its toll on the banking sector - which fared badly in last month\u2019s eurozone stress tests. Back at the CBI conference, Fredrik Reinfeldt, leader of the Moderate Party and former Prime Minister of Sweden is telling business leaders\u201chow to restore Europe\u2019s competitive advantage\u201d. Reinfeldt sets out what he sees as four priorities to boost competitiveness. \u201cYou need to be able to handle a financial crisis\u201d, a future one, not the last one, he adds. [this is something Mark Carney tried to address this morning with new capital rules for the biggest banks] Europe needs to address highly indebted countries, which are creating uncertainties about public finances. \u201cYou need to address the fact of your unit labour cost, this is at the core of being competitive\u201d. \u201cYou need to have [a] better functioning internal market\u201d. Britain\u2019s PM has also addressed the event -- full highlights here: Cameron and Miliband speak at the CBI annual conference: Politics Live blog Greece has fallen deeper into deflation, according to the latest consumer prices data just released. CPI fell by an alarming 1.7% year-on-year in October, from \u2018just\u2019 minus 0.8% in September. That\u2019s the biggest drop this year. On an EU harmonised basis, prices are down by 1.8% over the last year, from minus 1.1% last month. That means prices have now been falling for the last 20 months running, as Greece\u2019s austerity programme hits demand and forces down wages. Just getting some Greek industrial production data on the wires, suggesting the country\u2019s downturn continued.... Industrial output in September was 5.1% lower than a year ago, following a 5.9% annual slide in August. Back in London, Sir Mike Rake is kicking off the CBI conference with a speech outlining the business lobby group\u2019s case for Britain staying in the EU. He also has a list of reasons to be nervous about the pace of recovery, my colleague Katie Allen reports. Rake says Britain is \u201ccontinuing its journey back to growth\u201d.... ...But he adds that \u201cmany challenges remain\u201d: export performance is \u201cnot matching our ambitions\u201d, wages \u201cremain subdued\u201d, productivity is \u201cdisappointing\u201d and on the public finances front more work is needed with \u201cone of the largest deficits\u201d in the OECD group of mainly rich countries. \u201cThere are tough decisions ahead for the next government if it is to balance the books.\u201d (this morning\u2019s FT explains how the government must make deeper cuts in the next parliament to hit its budget goals) Rake also highlights risks in the eurozone and further afield. Rake, says: \u201cWe cannot afford to make matters worse for ourselves... Underpinning many of the major political debates of our time is thus fundamental question about Britain\u2019s role in the world in the face of globalisation and increased competition.\u201d The full conference being webcast here. And my colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering the political action (speeches from David Cameron and Ed Miliband) in his liveblog. Cameron and Miliband speak at the CBI annual conference: Politics Live blog Maxime Sbaihi, Eurozone economist at Bloomberg, also reckons that the decline in Italian industrial output will drag down its economy. Italy is already on the brink of recession, after seeing its GDP decline by 0.2% in the second quarter of the year (Q1 was flat) Fears over Italy\u2019s weak economy have just deepened, with the news that manufacturing output has fallen again. Statistics body ISTAT reports that Italian industrial production shrank by 0.9% month-on-month in September. Economists had expected a 0.2% decline. That means that industrial production has shrunk by 1.1% over the last quarter, accelerating from a 0.5% decline in April-June. That\u2019s the biggest fall since the last three months of 2012. And on an annual basis. production was 2.9% lower than in September 2013 (when you adjust for the fact there was an extra working day this year). I fear this makes it more likely that Italy will officially enter recession again on Friday, when eurozone GDP figures for the third quarter of the year are released. Full story: Serco shares crash after latest profits warning Ouch. In the City, shares in outsourcing firm Serco have tumbled by around 30% after it hit shareholders with a profits warning, and a big cash call. Serco is proposing to raise \u00a3550m through a rights issue after cutting its earnings forecast again. It also identified \u00a31.5bn of impairments on a string of public sector contracts, including maintaining patrol boats for the Royal Australian Navy, and various deals with the UK government. That sent Serco\u2019s share price down to a 10-year low: Rupert Soames, the newish CEO, reckons Serco is taking its medicine now. \u201cThe rapid progress we have made in recent weeks on the Strategy Review and the Contract &amp; Balance Sheet Reviews has brought us to the point that we are able to provide an initial estimate of the impairments, write-downs and Onerous Contract Provisions that are likely to be required at year end. Whilst it is a bitter pill, it is better for all concerned that we swallow it now and establish a really solid foundation on which to build Serco\u2019s future.\u201d There\u2019s a spot of French in the statement too. Europe\u2019s stock markets are have risen a little in early trading. No major dramas - Danish brewer Carlsberg are up 3% in Copenhagen, after posting higher sales despite the impact of Russian sanctions. Britain\u2019s CBI set the scene for today\u2019s annual conference by backing two new policies to help working families: My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The CBI is calling for a gradual increase in the threshold at which employees pay national insurance to \u00a310,500 \u2013 bringing it line with the income tax personal allowance \u2013 over the next parliament. It calculates that for a family with two earners, it would mean an extra \u00a3363 a year in take-home pay. \u201cI think that would make a difference,\u201d Cridland said. The CBI calls for an extension of the 15 hours a week of free childcare for three- and four-year-olds to all one- and two-year-olds, saving the average family with a one-year-old \u00a33,430 a year. But as many readers have pointed out, perhaps business leaders could do their bit and actually push wages up too, rather than expecting government to do everything..... CBI calls for tax cuts and childcare subsidies for working families The FSB has also predicted that these new capital rules for the world\u2019s most powerful banks could push up their cost of doing business. That could make them less competitive, or able to pay smaller salaries. An incentive to not become a globally systemic bank.... Mark Carney has also declared this morning that regulators have reached a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d in squashing the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d problem. The Financial Stability Board has agreed new standards for globally systemic banks, which should force them to hold enough capital to absorb losses without threatening financial stability. Carney said: \u201cOnce implemented, these agreements will play important roles in enabling globally systemic banks to be resolved without recourse to public subsidy and without disruption to the wider financial system.\u201d If the FSB is right, the rules could avoid a repeat of the taxpayer bailouts that were implemented in the financial crisis of 2008-09. Full story here: Mark Carney hails new deal for \u2018too big to fail\u2019 banks Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, has issued a plea for the world\u2019s central banks and regulators to work more closely to tackle financial misconduct. Speaking in Basel a few moments ago, Carney warned that authorities need closer co-operation to tackle bad behaviour. He also cautioned that the culture of the sector needs to be improved -- simply announcing new market reforms isn\u2019t enough to make miscreants toe the line. As Carney put it: \u201cWe need the fixes to bank conduct but we also need to ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, there is coordination across authorities, both in terms of identifying, investigating and punishing misconduct,\u201d Carney was speaking in his role as chief of the Financial Stability Board, the body that overseas the global financial system. And he warned that the stability of the system could be threatened by the failure \u201cWe are undertaking a series of reforms that change the way markets work which reduce the opportunity of misconduct, but that\u2019s not the same as having the right culture codes in order to perceive it. This has risen to the level of financial stability and we need a comprehensive approach to address it.\u201d The warning comes as UK regulators prepare to impose large fines on a group of banks over allegations that their staff conspired to rig currency rates. More to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Looks like a quiet start to the week, as the markets digest what last Friday\u2019s unspectacular US jobs report means for the economy. Two pieces of European economic data could be interesting, as the region\u2019s economy continues to struggle. The latest Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence is released at 10am BST, and should show whether morale has deteriorated again this month. And we get new Italian industrial production data for September -- which may fuel fears that Italy\u2019s economy entered recession last quarter: We\u2019ll have an eye on the CBI\u2019s Annual Conference in London, which will include appearances from several \u2018senior cabinet ministers\u2019. Labour leader Ed Miliband is giving the keynote speech at 2.30pm, and will warn of the perils of Britain leaving the European Union. A high-pressure speech, given the rumours swirling about his own position. I\u2019ll be tracking the main events through the day...",

      "bodyText": "Policymakers have reached a watershed in their attempts to avoid a repeat of the multibillion-pound taxpayer bailouts of the banking system six years ago, the governor of the Bank of England said on Monday. Mark Carney said new standards being published for 30 of the world\u2019s biggest banks should ensure they hold enough capital to absorb any losses they incur, although experts questioned whether this would solve the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d problem. The move could pressure banks to cut bonuses and dividends as they bolster their balance sheets further or push up the cost of products to consumers as they amass more capital. \u201cOnce implemented, these agreements will play important roles in enabling globally systemic banks to be resolved without recourse to public subsidy and without disruption to the wider financial system,\u201d Carney said in Basel, Switzerland, speaking in his capacity as chairman of the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The new rules \u2013 published before the G20 leaders\u2019 meeting in Brisbane, Australia this weekend \u2013 concern the amount of capital that must be held by 30 banks designated as \u201cglobally systemically important\u201d. Known as G-Sibs, they include HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland and will be required to comply with the rules from 2019. Carney said: \u201cAgreement on proposals for a common international standard on total loss-absorbing capacity for G-Sibs is a watershed in ending \u2018too big to fail\u2019 for banks.\u201d The aim is for bank losses to be absorbed by investors in their shares and bonds without the need for taxpayers to step in to prevent savers losing out from the collapse of a bank. But David Ereira, banking partner at law firm Linklaters, said: \u201cThe FSB proposal is an important step in solving \u2018too big to fail\u2019 However, on its own it is insufficient to deal with the issue.\u201d The UK used \u00a365bn of taxpayers\u2019 cash to prop up RBS and Lloyds Banking Group, and billions more to keep the financial system afloat, during the financial crisis. The government has yet to sell off any of its stake in RBS though it has reduced its shareholding in Lloyds. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, the system we\u2019ve had up until now has been totally unfair,\u201d Carney told the BBC. \u201cThe banks and their shareholders and their creditors got the benefit when things went well. But when they went wrong, the British public and subsequent generations picked up the bill \u2013 and that\u2019s going to end.\u201d The FSB said banks would need to hold total loss-absorbing capital \u2013 known as TLAC \u2013 of 16-20% of their assets when adjusted for risk or 25% in some circumstances. This includes a number of financial instruments such as shares and certain types of bonds that become equity in times of crisis. As major banks prepare for record fines for rigging currency markets to be announced this week, Carney also called for international cooperation on setting penalties for banks. \u201cWe need the fixes to bank conduct but we also need to ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, there is coordination across authorities, both in terms of identifying, investigating and punishing misconduct,\u201d he said. Six major banks are under pressure to agree a settlement with the FCA this week for foreign exchange rigging and will need to make decisions in the coming hours about whether to sanction the penalties, possibly the biggest fines ever levied. The proposals on capital were drawn up by the FSB after the G20 meeting in Saint Petersburg asked for ways to devise a system to avoid future taxpayer bailouts. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers\u2019 Association, said the proposals were complex and that more work needed to be done before putting them into practice. But he said: \u201cThe banking industry strongly supports this work, which is a really important step in ending \u2018too big to fail\u2019 and ensuring that never again will taxpayers have to step in to bail out banks.\u201d",

This includes a number of financial instruments such as shares and certain types of bonds that become equity in times of crisis.</p> <p>As major banks prepare for record fines for rigging currency markets to be announced this week, Carney also called for international cooperation on setting penalties for banks. \u201cWe need the fixes to bank conduct but we also need to ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, there is coordination across authorities, both in terms of identifying, investigating and punishing misconduct,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Six major banks are under pressure to agree a settlement with the FCA this week for foreign exchange rigging and will need to make decisions in the coming hours about whether to sanction the penalties, possibly the biggest fines ever levied.</p> <p>The proposals on capital were drawn up by the FSB after the G20 meeting in Saint Petersburg asked for ways to devise a system to avoid future taxpayer bailouts. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers\u2019 Association, said the proposals were complex and that more work needed to be done before putting them into practice. But he said: \u201cThe banking industry strongly supports this work, which is a really important step in ending \u2018too big to fail\u2019 and ensuring that never again will taxpayers have to step in to bail out banks.\u201d</p>",

That was the message delivered by David Cameron to the CBI\u2019s annual conference when he warned that more savings would have to be found in the next parliament. Just how big those savings will need to be is still a matter of conjecture. But, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, by the time of the 2015 election the government will be less than halfway through an austerity programme it assumed would be over within the duration of one parliament. The institute has dismissed the prime minister\u2019s argument that after \u00a3100bn of cuts in his first term in Downing Street, there is only a \u00a325bn mopping-up exercise still to go after the election. On the contrary, it has estimated that some Whitehall departments could be looking at a cumulative fall in their budgets of a third since 2010. More cuts are coming for two main reasons. Although the economy is now growing at an annual rate of 3%, performance in the first three years of the parliament did not meet expectations. Lower growth means weaker tax revenues. A second factor has been the tendency of the economy to create lots of low-paid jobs. Many of those who have found work in the past couple of years do not earn enough to pay income tax. The ease with which some multinational companies have used loopholes and tax havens to minimise their tax bills has not helped either. Back in 2010, George Osborne thought the government\u2019s annual budget deficit \u2013 the gap between its spending and its income \u2013 would be below \u00a340bn this year. As things stand, it will be close to \u00a3100bn. Hence the need for continued austerity. So why is the pain likely to be bigger than Cameron is suggesting? Well, according to the IFS, the prime minister has included in his \u00a3100bn of savings some of the cuts that are due to take place in the first year of the next parliament. His figures also exclude the last year of the next parliament. That makes the projected cuts look less onerous. In addition, he is using two different measures of spending that are not strictly comparable. The projected \u00a325bn of savings that the prime minister has pencilled in for the next parliament is a measure of all government spending bar interest payments. But the cost of an ageing population means that spending in some areas has been rising and will continue to rise. That makes reducing overall spending by \u00a325bn more difficult. The \u00a3100bn figure cited by the prime minister is a measure of discretionary spending cuts made between 2010 and 2015-16. \u201cTo say that there have been \u2018savings\u2019 of \u00a3100bn over this parliament is a useful and interesting statement if one is clear about what it means (and takes account of the fact that it includes savings planned for 2015-16)\u201d, the IFS said. \u201cIt is also interesting and useful to say that \u00a325bn of \u2018savings\u2019 are planned over the next parliament (or at least for the years 2016-17 and 2017-18). But it is not useful to use those two numbers together to suggest that the vast majority of the planned cuts have happened. They haven\u2019t.\u201d A further complication is that big chunks of government spending \u2013 the NHS, schools and overseas development \u2013 have been ringfenced from cuts. That has meant even deeper cuts elsewhere in Whitehall. The IFS has estimated that departmental spending will be 17.1% lower in real terms in 2018-19 than it was in 2010-11. Were the ringfencing to continue, the cuts in non-protected departments would be 31.2%. Hence the reports that the next parliament could see spending cuts of close to \u00a350bn. These numbers are not, of course, set in stone because the next government could make different choices. George Osborne has set a target of running a budget surplus by the end of the next parliament. Neither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats propose being so stringent. It would be possible for the next government to limit departmental or welfare spending cuts by raising taxes. During the current parliament, more than 80% of deficit reduction has been the result of taking the axe to spending. Back in the summer, the International Monetary Fund suggested that tax increases should also be explored. This does not entirely rule out the tax cuts Cameron and Osborne have pledged for the next parliament. What it does mean, however, is that they will not come until deep into the next parliament and will necessitate even deeper cuts in spending.",

      "bodyText": "Tensions have risen in the eastern Mediterranean with an escalating war of words between Athens, Ankara and Nicosia over oil and gas reserves in the region. Wrangling over hydrocarbons to be found in the area\u2019s waters, has intensified after the leaders of Greece, Cyprus and Egypt signed an agreement in Cairo on Saturday to boost energy cooperation. Within minutes of the accord being announced Cyprus\u2019s president, Nicos Anastasiades, accused Turkey of \u201cprovocative actions\u201d for sending a surveillance vessel and war ships to search for natural resources in the island\u2019s exclusive economic zone. \u201cTurkey\u2019s provocative actions do not just compromise the peace talks,\u201d he said, referring to UN-brokered reunification negotiations suspended by his government last month. \u201c[They] also affect security in the eastern Mediterranean region.\u201d Talks aimed at reuniting Greek and Turkish Cypriots were restarted earlier this year after a 10-year hiatus amid expectation that the under-sea reserves would facilitate resolution of the west\u2019s longest-running diplomatic dispute. With pipelines to be built through Turkey \u2013 by far the cheapest and most effective way of transferring the oil and gas to Europe \u2013 seasoned Cyprus watchers spoke of a potential game-changer. In May, the US vice-president, Joe Biden, underscored those hopes with the first visit to the island by a senior US official in almost 50 years. But instead of galvanising the feuding communities to conciliate, the prospect of finding alternative energy supplies appears to have widened the gulf between them. Turkey\u2019s decision to dispatch a research vessel into disputed waters last month not only resulted in talks being broken off but has exacerbated the row over drilling rights. On Sunday the head of the Turkish navy, Admiral B\u00fclent Bostano\u011flu, revealed he had been handed new rules of engagement in the event of \u201ca situation\u201d involving hydrocarbons in the eastern Mediterranean. \u201cWe will move according to the rules of engagement that have been given us,\u201d he said when asked how Turkey\u2019s navy would react if it encountered a Greek or Israeli ship in the region. On Monday, a senior Greek military official was quoted in the daily paper To Vima as saying: \u201cWe have rules of engagement, too, that have been approved by the prime minister and the cabinet, not only just in the Aegean but the south-east Mediterranean for the defence of our national interests.\u201d Although the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is unrecognised internationally, Ankara, its mainstay of financial and moral support,insists the statelet should also be participating in the exploration drive. Raising the alarm during a recent visit to Athens, the island\u2019s newly appointed UN representative, Espen Bard Elder, appealed for calm. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now is actually quite dangerous and I encourage everyone to do their best to avoid any kind of further escalation,\u201d he said. But the region\u2019s shifting alliances \u2013 symbolised by the accord signed in Cairo on Saturday \u2013 is unlikely to placate Turkey, already unnerved by events on its eastern front involving Islamic State (Isis). The agreement was arrived at days after Israel stepped up security cooperation with Cyprus. After the discovery of its own vast reserves, Tel Aviv desperately needs safe export routes through pipelines that go via the island. Visiting Nicosia last week the Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, lambasted Turkey for intruding on Cyprus\u2019s exclusive economic zone \u2013 criticism echoed by the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, when he too held talks in the capital on Friday. Ankara, which sees itself as the region\u2019s burgeoning economic powerhouse, has signalled that it will respond in kind. Before a visit to the Turkish capital by the US vice-president later this month, it has conveyed its displeasure at the signing of the Cairo accord. \u201cTension is definitely on the rise,\u201d said Hubert Faussmann, associate professor of history and political science at the University of Nicosia. \u201cThe peace talks have become a victim of the hydrocarbons which are inseparably linked to the Cyprus problem. They have escalated rather than de-escalated the situation,\u201d he told the Guardian from Nicosia.",

      "bodyText": "The government must boost living standards for Britain\u2019s working families with \u00a37bn of tax cuts and childcare subsidies, the CBI has urged. The business lobby group said radical ideas were needed to provide immediate relief for families and low-income workers blighted by falling real pay since the financial crisis. It is calling for changes to national insurance, an extension of free childcare and extended maternity pay as measures that would make an immediate difference. Publishing a report, A Better Off Britain, to coincide with the CBI\u2019s annual conference in London on Monday, John Cridland, the director general, said: \u201cThe financial crisis and the slow recovery have hit people\u2019s finances hard. Living standards will gradually improve as the economy does. But growth on its own will not be the miracle cure.\u201d The CBI is calling for a gradual increase in the threshold at which employees pay national insurance to \u00a310,500 \u2013 bringing it line with the income tax personal allowance \u2013 over the next parliament. It calculates that for a family with two earners, it would mean an extra \u00a3363 a year in take-home pay. \u201cI think that would make a difference,\u201d Cridland said. The CBI calls for an extension of the 15 hours a week of free childcare for three- and four-year-olds to all one- and two-year-olds, saving the average family with a one-year-old \u00a33,430 a year. It also recommends statutory maternity pay be extended from nine to 12 months, closing the gap between when maternity pay ends and financial assistance for childcare kicks in. Cridland said that despite the expense to the Treasury \u2013 about \u00a37bn over the next parliament \u2013 the measures did not amount to the government abandoning its deficit reduction plans. Instead they would boost growth through additional consumer spending and by widening the talent pool and generating greater tax revenues as more mothers return to work. Once the economic benefits of the measures are factored in, by the end of the next parliament the net cost to the Treasury would be about \u00a33bn according to the CBI\u2019s estimates. \u201cTackling the deficit is an absolute priority, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an either/or debate. We need to be more ambitious about the ways we tackle the deficit. Deficit reduction doesn\u2019t have to be cut and slash.\u201d The average couple with two children saw their real income fall by \u00a32,132 a year between 20091-10 and 2012-13 according to the CBI. Inflation has outpaced wage growth for much of the period since 2008. Cridland rejected the idea that business were to blame for falling living standards by failing to boost wages for workers. \u201cYou can\u2019t mandate increases in wages. Wages are at the level that an employer can sustain with the business that they can generate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe National Minimum Wage is about ability to pay. The Living Wage is what people need to earn. Should companies pay the Living Wage if they are able to? Yes. I would encourage them to. Can it ever be more than an encouragement? No.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Kurt Geiger will add a London flagship store early next year to its growing empire of shoe shops around the world following a jump in sales boosted by its Bond &amp; Britton heels and Saffiano handbags. The British luxury brand, whose shoes are worn by stars including Beyonc\u00e9 and Julia Roberts, reported a 13% increase in like-for-like sales for the third quarter, bucking a tough retail climate. Many clothes retailers have blamed the weather for sluggish sales, including Next, one of Britain\u2019s most successful retailers. Kurt Geiger, for its part, is expecting double digit sales growth for 2014 and \u201cstrong\u201d underlying profits. Alongside its Bond &amp; Britton high heel court shoes, priced at \u00a3250 to \u00a3295 a pair, casual shoes such as slip-ons and flats are proving increasingly popular among customers. The firm has branched out into handbags and other accessories such as jewellery, and phone and tablet cases. It credited the launch of the Saffiano leather range with a 50% rise in handbag sales so far this year \u2013 especially after British model and actor Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was seen carrying the red Saffiano bowling bag in Hollywood. American actors Jon Hamm and Channing Tatum have been spotted wearing Kurt Geiger\u2019s men\u2019s collection. The shoe retailer was bought out by its chief executive, Neil Clifford, and other managers in April with the backing of US private equity house Sycamore Partners, to which it had been sold as part of the Jones Group in a $1.2bn (\u00a3750m) deal. Clifford talked of a \u201ctremendous year\u201d for Kurt Geiger. \u201cFollowing our management buyout, the company\u2019s new strategic direction has facilitated a renewed focus on growth and international expansion.\u201d He said the company was trying to appeal to everyone, from Hollywood stars to fashion-aware shoppers. Its Shoeaholics website sells men\u2019s boots from \u00a329 and court and flat shoes from \u00a319. Like-for-like sales at the retailer are up 13% in the first seven months of this year, taking gross turnover to \u00a3210m, compared with \u00a3230m for the whole of last year. A fifth of sales are now made via the internet, following 30% online growth. Kurt Geiger has opened 28 stores this year, including 20 in the UK and a flagship store in Milan, while franchise partners opened flagship stores in Thailand, Hong Kong, China and Singapore. It now has 59 independent shops worldwide and 198 department store concessions. In the UK, a store in Bicester Village shopping centre is due to open in December, followed by a London flagship in the Oxford Street area early next year. It also runs multi-branded shoe departments in Selfridges and Liberty and opened Harrods Shoe Heaven in August, which stocks more than 50 brands including Manolo Blahnik, Saint Laurent and Valentino.
