      "bodyText": "Lady Green, the wife of Sir Philip Green, enjoyed a \u00a353m windfall after the sale of BHS\u2019s headquarters to Arcadia, the retail business controlled by the couple. The deal for Marylebone House in north London is likely to pose further questions for the Greens about their role in the collapse of BHS. The property transaction is revealed in the annual accounts of Arcadia, which also show that the owner of Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Wallis has a pension deficit of \u00a3151m. Marylebone House was not owned by BHS but controlled by Lady Green through a company called Wilton Equity Ltd, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands. However, Arcadia bought the share capital in Wilton Equity for \u00a353m, giving it ownership of the building. The company says the deal was conducted \u201con an arms length basis following advice received from a third party valuer\u201d. Arcadia is owned by Taveta Investments, whose shareholders include Lady Green, the Arcadia chairman Lord Grabiner, and other directors. A spokesman for Arcadia said: \u201cThe accounts lay out all the details of the transaction.\u201d The deal is important because Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, told MPs on Wednesday that his consortium, Retail Acquisitions, was going to buy Marylebone House in March 2015 from the Greens. The complex deal would have handed a \u00a310m windfall to Retail Acquisitions to invest in BHS. However, Green pulled out of the deal and later paid compensation to the consortium, Chappell alleged. Arcadia took a \u00a3310m hit from the sale of BHS, according to the accounts. This included \u00a3217m of loans to BHS being written off and more than \u00a330m of cash being pumped into the department store chain. Despite the sale, Taveta, the parent company, reported an increase in pre-tax profits from \u00a3118m in 2014 to \u00a3151m in the year to 28 August 2015. An Arcadia spokesman claimed the company could cope with its pension deficit, saying: \u201cArcadia is a world-leading retail group, which made an operating profit of \u00a3240m last year and has no borrowings at the operating level.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Boots UK boss Simon Roberts quits", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Boots has parted company with the boss of its UK operation weeks after a Guardian investigation revealed concerns about its business practices. The pharmacy chain\u2019s US parent company, Walgreens Boots Alliance, said Simon Roberts would be leaving in July \u201cto pursue new opportunities\u201d. He has been with the company for 13 years, the last three as president of Boots. A recent investigation by the Guardian revealed managers were directing their pharmacists to provide medicine-use reviews (MUR) to customers who did not need them, in order to claim public money from the NHS. The NHS pays \u00a328 for each MUR, which is carried out by a pharmacist and intended to give patients professional advice on health, diet and how to manage their medicines. The company\u2019s pharmacists also alleged that a drive to cut costs was endangering patients and putting the pharmacists themselves under unreasonable pressure \u2013 in some cases affecting their own health. The departure of Roberts, who was also an executive president of Walgreens Boots Alliance, was announced as part of a senior management reshuffle at the corporation. Alex Gourlay, who was promoted to co-chief operating officer, will take overall responsibility for Boots in the UK. Gourlay joined Boots as a Saturday assistant in 1976 and rejoined as a pharmacist after attending university. He has held numerous roles within the company, including managing director of Boots, and experts suggested the decision to put a professional pharmacist back in charge of Boots was significant. Elizabeth Fagan, another Boots veteran, becomes managing director and will report to Gourlay. Roberts said the decision to leave had been difficult. \u201cOver the past three years we have achieved good progress in modernising our business, and plans to build an even better Boots are well on track. I\u2019ve therefore come to realise that now is the right time for me to step away and consider new opportunities.\u201d Yves Romestan, a spokesman for Walgreens Boots Alliance, insisted Roberts\u2019 departure was a personal decision taken months ago. \u201cThe decision to leave the company translates his desire to embrace a new professional challenge and spend more time with his family.\u201d The UK\u2019s pharmacy watchdog is still considering whether to launch an investigation into Boots. The General Pharmaceutical Council began to call in evidence two days after the Guardian published its investigation and asked to see a copy of a survey by the pharmacy trade union, the Pharmacists\u2019 Defence Association (PDA), cited by the Guardian in its report. One in 10 Boots pharmacists responded to the survey. Asked how often they believed financial cutbacks had \u201cdirectly impacted upon patient safety\u201d, more than 75% of PDA respondents said that was the case at least half the time. Once a famously paternalistic British institution, Boots has strayed a long way from its Nottingham roots. Like some of the other industrialists of the Victorian era, its founder, Jesse Boot, was famous for watching closely over his staff. However, the company has been transformed over the past decade. The changes at Boots, which employs 60,000 people in the UK, has been led by the Italian billionaire Stefano Pessina, a former nuclear engineer who in 2006 masterminded a merger with his lesser-known drugs wholesaler Alliance UniChem to create Alliance Boots. The Monaco-based serial dealmaker, who is worth an estimated \u00a39.5bn, then teamed up with the US buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) to buy the group off the stock market in 2007. Five years later he presided over a merger with the US drugstore Walgreens that means Boots is now part of an American corporate giant, listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in New York. After several years spent combining the two companies, Walgreens Boots Alliance is now focused on managing it more efficiently. In February, Boots announced it could cut up to 350 jobs from its larger shops as it pressed ahead with a three-year plan to boost growth. Gourlay said he was pleased to being overseeing Boots again. \u201cBoots is the professional \u2018home\u2019 where I grew up, as a pharmacist and as a business leader. It is great to be once again directly involved in the business.\u201d In a sign of the group\u2019s renewed focus on Boots after the distraction of the merger, Fagan said: \u201cHealthcare is at the heart of everything we do, and Boots is the heart of healthcare on the UK\u2019s high streets.\u201d Pessina, 75, continues to be the company\u2019s driving force as chief executive. \u201cI would like to warmly thank Simon for his outstanding contribution and for the key role he played at Boots during the past 13 years of his career,\u201d he said. Boots says its clear policy is that all clinical services should only be provided where it is in a patients best interests to do so.",

The former Tesco executive was awarded the payout after Morrisons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/morrisons-returns-to-profit-as-sales-start-to-rise\">bounced back to profitability and improved sales</a>.

Other companies pay more but they mustn\u2019t put it up too much next year.\u201d<br></p> <p>Higginson said now that remuneration reports have to be approved by shareholders, there should be no dispute over the payouts. \u201cIf they have good performance and rewards come as a consequence that should really be a bit of a non-event as they have signed off the parameters,\u201d he said \u201cPerformance has been better and David didn\u2019t take a pay rise. It is a non-issue for us.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Potts told shareholders at the meeting that Morrisons would be putting women\u2019s clothing into 50 stores under its Nutmeg brand early next year. Nutmeg currently sells children\u2019s and babywear, which Potts wants to put into all stores next year. It will now expand into leisure and workwear for women. \u201cIt is about giving more reasons to shop in Morrisons in a contemporary world,\u201d Potts said.</p>",

Then 30% of investors voted against the remuneration report at Paddy Power Betfair, and estate agent Foxtons promised to consult further with investors after 20% of shareholders voted against the remuneration report. But Higginson said remuneration was a \u201cnon-issue\u201d for Morrisons, where Potts received a \u00a31m bonus, doubling his total earnings to \u00a32.25m. The former Tesco executive was awarded the payout after Morrisons bounced back to profitability and improved sales. However, total sales for the year to 31 January fell 4.1% to \u00a316.1bn after the group closed a net 20 stores. One independent shareholder attending the meeting at Morrisons\u2019 head office in Bradford said: \u201cThese bosses get too much \u2013 he is just a man, after all. There should be more for shareholders.\u201d Another said he would not vote to block Potts\u2019 pay and was pleased with his efforts to turn around the company, but also said: \u201cIt\u2019s not too bad. Other companies pay more but they mustn\u2019t put it up too much next year.\u201d Higginson said now that remuneration reports have to be approved by shareholders, there should be no dispute over the payouts. \u201cIf they have good performance and rewards come as a consequence that should really be a bit of a non-event as they have signed off the parameters,\u201d he said \u201cPerformance has been better and David didn\u2019t take a pay rise. It is a non-issue for us.\u201d Meanwhile, Potts told shareholders at the meeting that Morrisons would be putting women\u2019s clothing into 50 stores under its Nutmeg brand early next year. Nutmeg currently sells children\u2019s and babywear, which Potts wants to put into all stores next year. It will now expand into leisure and workwear for women. \u201cIt is about giving more reasons to shop in Morrisons in a contemporary world,\u201d Potts said.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the moment the supermarkets have supposedly dreaded. Big, bad Amazon is getting serious about selling groceries in Britain. It has launched its Fresh service in north and east London, with 130,000 products in the range and same-day delivery available for orders placed before 1pm. It\u2019s a shopping revolution, or so we are invited to believe. It might be \u2013 but only in about a decade\u2019s time. On an initial inspection of the Amazonian entry, the pitch is metropolitan, small time and aimed at Ocado territory. It should not be an immediate source of terror for mass-market supermarkets. The clever bit is in the incorporation of products from independent butchers, bakers and fishmongers; Amazon does something similar in Seattle. But the delivery charges aren\u2019t cheap by comparison with UK supermarkets. Amazon punters are being asked to pay a monthly fee of \u00a36.99 on top of the \u00a379-a-year Prime service. That\u2019s hardly undercutting the market, even if the prices of the branded cornflakes, etcetera, are promised to be \u201ccompetitive\u201d - which is what all supermarkets always say. HSBC analyst David McCarthy reckons Amazon will have done well if it is 50% of the size of Ocado in five years\u2019 time, in which case its share of the overall grocery market would be less than 0.5%. That estimate sounds about right. Turmoil tends to arrive slowly in supermarket-land. Discounters Aldi and Lidl only became seriously disruptive forces in the UK after more than a decade of slow and painful investment. As with the German duo, it\u2019s safe to assume Amazon will settle in for a long innings. So, over time, consumers may come to expect a smarter delivery service. One-hour slots, available at short notice, could become the norm, which would add expense for the retailer in an online market that already looks barely profitable for them. But that lies down the road. For the time being, Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s should fret less about Amazon and concentrate on the main event, which is still Aldi and Lidl. Sky\u2019s the limit, apparently A pattern is emerging. Sky overpays \u2013 compared with the City\u2019s expectations \u2013 for rights to top-league football, and its share price goes up. It happened when the broadcaster last year agreed the colossal sum of \u00a34.18bn for five plum prizes in the Premier League\u2019s auction of rights for three seasons. Now there\u2019s a repeat in Germany. Sky will pay an average of \u20ac876m per season for four years to retain its dominance of Bundesliga rights, a hefty increase from its current rate of \u20ac486m per season. Sky\u2019s shares were the biggest improver in the FTSE 100 index, up 2.8%. Perverse? Not really. The very worst outcome in Germany for Sky would have been a loss of dominance in top-league football. Its German business is younger, vastly less profitable and could not afford to live without the football addiction, whatever Sky says about broadening the range of content. What\u2019s more, the new owner of the smaller Friday-night Bundesliga package is a foe Sky will happily tolerate. It is Eurosport, owned by Discovery, and not BT-lookalike Deutsche Telekom. The rate of inflation in football rights \u2013 in the UK and Germany \u2013 still looks absurd, and the only certain winners will be the millionaire players and their agents. But the prices probably still look to pass a pure commercial test. For Sky\u2019s shareholders, the Bundesliga result is a victory of sorts. Store card woes in Home Retail Whoops, there goes a sum equivalent to almost a third of last year\u2019s profits. Ok, \u00a330m is currently only Home Retail Group\u2019s estimate of how much it will cost to reimburse customers who were overcharged when they were late to pay off their storecard debts. And it is too small to derail Sainsbury\u2019s planned \u00a31.4bn takeover of Home Retail, now reduced to its Argos chain. All the same, a \u00a330m charge for customer redress is hardly a rounding error in the context of a company that made pre-tax profits last year of \u00a395m. If Home Retail chief executive John Walden is miffed that the overcharging gaffe took the shine off Argos\u2019 return to like-for-like sales growth, he shouldn\u2019t be. Instead of an extended boast about growth of 0.1%. shareholders might have appreciated a fuller explanation of how an elementary error happened in the first place.

    "webTitle": "Marks & Spencer cuts Marc Bolland's final bonus by 20%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The board of Marks &amp; Spencer took the unusual step of cutting Marc Bolland\u2019s final bonus by a fifth, although the former chief executive still earned \u00a317m over his six-year stint. Vindi Banga, the chair of M&amp;S\u2019s remuneration committee, said after weighing up the retailer\u2019s overall performance during the year, particularly in light of project delays, it had \u201cdetermined that the bonus for the chief executive be subject to a discretionary downward adjustment of 20%\u201d. The cut meant the Dutchman collected a bonus payment of \u00a3622,000, equivalent to 64% of his annual salary rather than 80%, according to the M&amp;S annual report. Bolland still earned a total of \u00a32m in his final year in charge, a period when underlying profits rose by just 3.5% to \u00a3684.1m. His successor, Steve Rowe, who took charge at the start of April, earned \u00a31m and in his new role is entitled to a salary of \u00a3810,000 compared with Bolland\u2019s \u00a3975,000. M&amp;S also revealed that Bolland earned \u00a317.1m over his six years in charge. His period at the helm was characterised by investment with about \u00a33bn ploughed into its creaking infrastructure, including new warehouses and website, rather than the profits recovery investors hoped for. While M&amp;S\u2019s food halls prospered under the former Morrisons chief executive\u2019s control, the company\u2019s fashion and homeware business went backwards. Its clothing sales have grown in only one quarter over the past five years. Unlike Bolland, who despite the declining sales picture continued to defend the company\u2019s performance in clothing, Rowe was quick to brand the long-running slump as unsatisfactory. Rowe, who has worked at M&amp;S for 26 years, used his first annual results presentation last month to outline a strategy promising sharper clothing prices and a less slavish pursuit of catwalk trends. Rowe also vowed to put more effort into better serving its most loyal group of shoppers, dubbed \u201cMrs M&amp;S\u201d. These fiftysomething women had been neglected as it chased younger shoppers but Rowe promised to \u201ccherish and listen to her\u201d.

    "webTitle": "BHS collapse could cost taxpayer \u00a335m", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The taxpayer faces a bill of up to \u00a336m for the controversial collapse of the BHS department store chain. The administrator\u2019s report for BHS Limited, which has been seen by the Guardian, reveals the company owes \u00a315.4m in VAT, \u00a3963,000 in corporation tax and \u00a320m in \u201cresidual employee claims\u201d. The employee claims include redundancy costs that will have to be picked up by the government\u2019s Redundancy Payments Service. Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrator, said it expected to make some form of payment to unsecured creditors of BHS, but warned this would depend on the money raised from the sale of company assets and could be as little as 3p in the pound. The company collapsed owing more than \u00a31.1bn. This includes a \u00a3571m pension deficit, \u00a3358m to landlords and \u00a348.5m to suppliers. The secured creditors are led by Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail business Arcadia, which is owed \u00a335m. Arcadia is likely to be repaid in full, Duff &amp; Phelps said. This will provoke further anger towards Green over his handling of BHS, which he sold to three-time bankrupt Dominic Chappell last year. Green and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his tenure at BHS. A group of Conservative MPs are preparing to call on the honours committee to strip Green of his knighthood if the billionaire refuses to pump hundreds of millions into BHS\u2019s pension fund in order to fill a \u00a3571m deficit. According to the Press Association, a group of backbench MPs will write to the honours forfeiture committee ahead of Green\u2019s appearance in front of a parliamentary committee next week. The committee will analyse the request and can advise the Queen to withdraw the honour if a criminal offence has been committed, a person has been struck off a regulatory body or in exceptional circumstances. A spokesperson for the prime minister said: \u201cThere is a clear process for looking at cases where people already have honours and those are called into question. \u201cIf anyone wants to make a case, they need to make an application to the honours forfeiture committee who would then consider it. It\u2019s not government, it\u2019s a separate committee.\u201d The parliamentary investigation into the collapse of BHS will question Green on Wednesday. The Topshop boss controlled BHS for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions in March 2015. MPs have called a host of new witnesses to give evidence, at a date to be determined, as their investigation into BHS widens. These include property mogul Alexander Dellal, who helped to finance Retail Acquisitions, and Paul Sutton, a businessman who introduced Chappell to Green. Mike Ashley will provide written evidence about a bid to rescue BHS by Sports Direct. The MPs have also called a collection of figures from Green\u2019s inner circle including Richard Caring, the restaurateur who used to own shares in BHS, Brett Palos, Green\u2019s stepson, and Neville Kahn of Deloitte, a long-time adviser to the tycoon. There are also recalls for Arcadia executives, including finance director Paul Budge and chairman Lord Grabiner, and Anthony Gutman of Goldman Sachs, who will be joined by two senior colleagues. The witnesses have been called after senior management at BHS and Chappell, the former owner, made explosive allegations to the work and pensions committee and the business, innovation and skills committee on Wednesday. The chief executive of BHS, Darren Topp, accused Chappell of having his \u201cfingers in the till\u201d and threatening to kill him. Chappell claimed Green had pushed BHS into administration after going \u201cinsane\u201d when he found out Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct was in talks about buying it. Duff &amp; Phelps also confirmed in the administrator\u2019s report for BHS Limited, the main trading company, that it had uncovered a number of financial transactions within BHS that require further investigation. \u201cDuring our preliminary investigations there are a number of transactions that on the face of it may require investigation. Additional information is required to understand the true nature of the transactions. The joint administrators will keep the creditors informed of any significant development,\u201d the administrator\u2019s report said. The Insolvency Service and the Pensions Regulator is also investigating the collapse of BHS, while the Serious Fraud Office is considering launching a probe. Duff &amp; Phelps said it had concentrated on securing company records, calling in mobile phones and laptops, meeting directors and senior management, and analysing financial information. BHS is being wound down, with its 163 shops closed, after Duff &amp; Phelps failed to secure a rescue deal for the retailer. The administrator\u2019s report confirmed that a potential deal broke down after the would-be buyer, thought to be a Portuguese-backed consortium, failed to prove it had the funds to buy BHS. Duff &amp; Phelps said there were five bids to buy BHS, but four of the parties withdrew. This left \u201cbidder 4\u201d, who had offered \u00a330m to save the retailer. \u201cBidder 4 was provided with a final opportunity to provide proof of funding but this deadline passed and as such, in the absence of any other viable going concern offers, the joint administrators had no alternative but to announce the managed wind down of the business,\u201d the administrator said. Duff &amp; Phelps also contradicted Chappell\u2019s claim that administrators were called into BHS after Green blocked a rescue deal with Ashley. It said BHS sought legal advice about its future options on 15 April \u2013 10 days before the appointment of administrators \u2013 after the sale of its London Oxford Street store and a proposed loan with Gordon Brothers, the restructuring firm, raised less funds than it expected. The BHS board then met the board of Arcadia, including Green, on 18 April, when it warned \u201cit had insufficient funds to continue to trade in the short to medium term and that an insolvency process was likely\u201d. Arcadia, a key creditor, agreed and contacted Duff &amp; Phelps to ask they meet BHS executives on 19 April. At a BHS board meeting on 21 April the board then resolved to put the company into administration the following day. According to Duff &amp; Phelps, the board of Retail Acquisitions was then approached by an unconnected UK retailer \u2013 Sports Direct \u2013 with \u201ca view to rescuing the BHS Group\u201d. These negotiations \u201cfailed\u201d on the evening of 24 April, and Duff &amp; Phelps was appointed as administrator on 25 April.",

      "bodyText": "A record jump for Britain\u2019s goods exports helped the country\u2019s trade deficit fall more than expected in April. Coming after a set of healthy figures from the high street and the manufacturing sector, the trade figures showed the UK economy had steadied ahead of the EU referendum, following a wobble in the first three months of the year. The chancellor, George Osborne, was handed an extra boost after figures showed the growth in exports over the past year was mainly to the rest of the EU, with only a small rise in sales to the rest of the world. Exports of British-made goods to the EU increased by 10.3% compared with a year ago while non-EU exports nudged just 1.9% higher. However, in April alone exports to the rest of the world performed better after a \u00a31.3bn jump to a record \u00a314bn, compared with a \u00a3900m rise in exports to the EU. The latest figures also ease concerns after last month\u2019s figures showed Britain\u2019s trade deficit with other EU countries was running at a record high. Britain\u2019s current account deficit, which reflects the trade gap with the rest of the world and the shortfall between money paid out by the UK and money coming in, is one of the biggest in the world. The rise in the deficit to almost 7% in March was seized on by campaigners for Britain to remain in the EU, who argued it would only worsen if Britain quit the single market. Brexit supporters have argued that bringing down trade barriers outside the EU would spur exports to the rest of the world. Overall, goods exports volumes increased by 11.2% in April \u2013 the biggest monthly rise since records began in 1998. At \u00a326.1bn, the total value of goods exported in April was close to the record high set in June 2013. Imports also increased, by \u00a32bn to \u00a336.6bn. The trade deficit in goods fell to \u00a310.5bn from a downwardly revised \u00a310.6bn in March, according to the figures from the Office for National Statistics. The total trade deficit, including services, narrowed to a seven-month low of \u00a33.3bn in April from a downwardly revised \u00a33.5bn in March and a peak of \u00a35.2bn in January. The increase in exports to the EU follows a steady rise in economic growth across the 28 member states, at a time when emerging economies have struggled to maintain the strong expansion of the last two decades and previously fast-growing countries Russia, Brazil and South Africa have slumped into recession. Zach Witton, the deputy chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said the data provided some encouragement that the UK\u2019s export performance was improving, \u201cbacking up recent signs that Europe\u2019s economic recovery is gaining momentum, while global growth may be starting to turn a corner\u201d. He said it was also possible that the recent weakness of sterling may be providing some support for exporters, though there was still \u201ca long way to go to reach the government\u2019s export target of \u00a31tn annually by 2020\u201d. Howard Archer, the chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said the figures gave hope that the overall weakening of the pound since late-2015 could be feeding through to help UK exporters. \u201cAlong with the jump in industrial production in April and decent retail sales growth, the trade data suggests UK GDP growth could be holding up better in the second quarter than has been thought \u2013 despite the heightened uncertainty,\u201d he said. In 2015, the sale of goods and services to the EU accounted for 44% of total exports. Almost half of the UK\u2019s exports of goods go to the EU, compared with 39% of services. The share of exports to the EU has fallen by more than 10 percentage points over the last 15 years.",

Soros said he was confident that support for Britain to remain in the EU would rise in the two weeks remaining before the vote, but in any case there was a good chance the EU will collapse due to the migration crisis and challenges in Greece. But the recent strength in the pound, which has risen slightly in recent days after falling 10% between last November and April, was a sign that a vote to exit the EU is less likely. \u201cI\u2019m confident that as we get closer to the Brexit vote, the remain camp is getting stronger. Markets are not always right, but in this case I agree with them.\u201d Soros Fund Management, which manages $30bn for Soros and his family, sold a slice of its share holdings to invest in gold and companies that mine for gold, anticipating a slowdown in growth and further turbulence in global stock markets. Soros, who made $1bn when his 1992 currency bet forced John Major\u2019s government into a humiliating devaluation and led to sterling dropping out of the exchange rate mechanism, said an EU breakup was another threat to global stability along with concerns over the Chinese economy and a Trump presidency. In recent months the currency speculator has bet that a devaluation of the Chinese currency, the yuan, was inevitable, earning himself a rebuke from the Beijing authorities. \u201cChina continues to suffer from capital flight and has been depleting its foreign currency reserves while other Asian countries have been accumulating foreign currency,\u201d Soros said in an email to the Wall Street Journal. \u201cChina is facing internal conflict within its political leadership, and over the coming year this will complicate its ability to deal with financial issues.\u201d Gold, considered a safe haven by investors, has risen 17% since January to $1,244 an ounce.

      "bodyText": "With this, we are signing off for the day. Thank you for all your great comments. We\u2019ll be back at the crack of dawn tomorrow. Meanwhile, Britain\u2019s biggest wine retailer is to increase pay for its store managers in an attempt to prevent one in four of them leaving the business each year. Majestic Wine is introducing new share incentive plans and overhauling cash bonuses for its 213 store managers, who typically earn a \u00a330,000 salary \u2013 up from \u00a328,000 in November \u2013 plus an annual bonus. A cap limiting bonuses to \u00a31,000 was scrapped in November \u2013 a first step to reduce the high staff turnover. You can read the full story here. Ryanair is to take on Airbnb \u2013 by launching the Ryanair Rooms service in October, offering everything from 5-star hotel rooms to hostels and spare rooms in private homes. It will add at least two partners to Booking.com, currently its exclusive accommodation partner, Reuters reported. Chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said: We see this as a natural progression towards Ryanair.com becoming the Amazon of air travel. Catching up on corporate news\u2026 Argos has reported its strongest sales performance in two years as it prepares for its sale to Sainsbury\u2019s, but also revealed it had set aside \u00a330m to compensate store card customers who were charged \u201cexcess fees\u201d on late payments. It\u2019s not a massive amount of money \u2013 at most \u201cdouble-digit pounds\u201d per customer. But it\u2019s a bit embarrassing, just before the sale of the business to Sainsbury\u2019s which is expected to go through in the autumn. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Given the pending takeover, the board of Sainsbury\u2019s will probably be shaking their heads at the news, though in the grander scheme of things the sum involved is not enough to derail the deal. On a brighter note, 4K televisions, computers and tablets sold well in the first quarter; washing machines and gardening equipment didn\u2019t. You can read the full story here. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, has a take on the drop in 10-year UK bond yields to a record low. While all eyes have been on the EU referendum campaign, gilt yields have been slipping, fast. The US Federal Reserve is backing away from interest rate rises following wavering employment data, and in Europe the central bank is pumping billions of euros into the bond market every month in the form of quantitative easing, both of which have served to drive yields down. The low yield on government bonds paints a pretty pessimistic picture of the global economy, and suggests we are set for an extended period of low or negative inflation, and weak economic performance. The question though is whether one can really trust an indicator which has been so heavily distorted by central bank stimulus measures. Back at the Brussels Economic Forum, European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici and Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos have both identified Brexit as a potential crisis facing Europe. Moscovici: A year ago we were talking about Grexit, now we are talking about positive integration. There are several crises around... Brexit, hopefully it will be remain but we await that... The jobless claims will be a relief to those investors concerned by last week\u2019s shockingly weak payroll numbers. The non-farm payrolls showed just 38,000 jobs were added in the US in in May, compared with expectations of a 164,000 increase. It was the slowest rate of growth since September 2010. There were 264,000 jobless claims in the US last week, slightly down on the 268,000 a week earlier. It was a bigger-than-expected fall, with economists forecasting 27o,000 claims. It was also lower than the four-week average of 269,500. US markets are expected to open lower, as bond markets rally: Investors are selling shares and buying bonds, considered to be less risky assets at times of heightened uncertainty. Benchmark 10-year German bund yields have hit record lows, while Germany\u2019s DAX is the biggest faller among the major European equity markets. Draghi\u2019s rather gloomy comments earlier - when he appeared frustrated at the lack of progress on structural reforms by eurozone countries - is also weighing on investor sentiment. FTSE 100: -0.9% at 6,247 Germany\u2019s DAX: -1.3% at 10,084 France\u2019s CAC: -0.9% at 4,408 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.2% at 8,810 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.7% at 17,777 Pierre Moscovici, European Commissioner for economic and financial affairs, is speaking at the Brussels Economic Forum. He says that while he understands structural reforms have negative connotations in some countries and can be politically difficult to push through, \u201cwe need to stand firm\u201d. The way to tackle long-term unemployment and reduce social exclusion is through structural reforms, he says. Output growth will increasingly depend on our ability to improve productivity growth and investment. The key to this is investment in \u201chuman capital\u201d he says, partly through education and training. I want reform to mean progress. Rolls-Royce is one of the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest fallers, down 3.4% at 590.5p. The chief executive of the aircraft engine maker has apparently written to staff warning them that the company is falling behind on deliveries. Warren East urged his colleagues to work hard to ensure profit targets for this year are met, the FT reports. He wrote: [The] business remains in reasonable shape with opportunities and issues broadly balanced. Delivery issues mean there is a lot to do in the second half and hence a higher risk. East acknowledged times were tough for staff at Rolls-Royce, which issued issued a string of profit warnings and cut jobs. He told staff: Right now I do know that in many parts of the organisation that discomfort is very real indeed \u2026 For many at the moment \u2018transformation\u2019 is simply unpleasant. I appreciate that this is a difficult environment, difficult enough just to do the job, without people like me preaching about \u2018pace\u2019. If we really want to be the Rolls-Royce of our industry we must push through overdue changes we all know we have to make. Catching up on some corporate news, Amazon begins fresh food deliveries in parts of London today. Taking on Britain\u2019s supermarkets, Amazon Fresh will offer more than 130,000 groceries to homes in north and east London, including thousands of fresh produce, dairy and bakery items that the company has not previously sold in the UK. The service is available to Amazon Prime customers, who pay a subscription in return for fast delivery of goods. Ajay Kavan, vice-president of Amazon Fresh, said the key to the success of the service would be a combination of low prices, vast selection and fast delivery. The Guardian\u2019s Sarah Butler has the full story here. Low-income households are likely to shoulder a disproportionate share of the costs of Brexit if the UK votes to leave the EU in this month\u2019s referendum, a respected thinktank has warned. Under a worst-case scenario some low-income households could receive as much as \u00a35,542 per year less in tax credits and benefit payments in 2020, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. NIESR concludes that Brexit would knock government tax receipts and so force changes to tax and spending policies, assuming the government sticks to tough goals under George Osborne\u2019s fiscal charter to get the public finances into surplus. Angus Armstrong, one of the report authors, said: \u201cOur analysis combines the consensus of macroeconomic forecasts with the spirit of the government\u2019s fiscal charter. Based on these assumptions, our results show that a disproportionately large share of the costs of Brexit is likely to fall on low-income households.\u201d (Full story here.) We\u2019ve got more reaction to those better-than-expected UK trade figures. Not everyone is convinced that trade will make a positive contribution to GDP in the second quarter. David Kern, British Chambers of Commerce: While the fall in the trade deficit is welcome, it still remains unacceptably large and is likely to be a drag on UK growth in Q2. April\u2019s figures also highlight the need for the government to do more to support exporters, including improved access to finance for companies looking to break into new fast-growing economies. Martin Beck, EY ITEM Club: While export volumes were up 4.3% in the three months to April compared with the previous three months, import volumes were up by 4.6% over the same period. So as things stand net trade is likely to exert a drag on GDP growth in Q2, unless April\u2019s apparent export strength is sustained. The chances of this happening would appear to be relatively low. Global growth remains pretty subdued and sterling has regained a good chunk of its losses from earlier in the year, so the backdrop for exporters remains very challenging. George Soros, the billionaire investor who famously helped to force the pound out of the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday in 1992, has been speaking about Brexit. He told the Wall Street Journal that a combination of Brexit, problems in Greece, and the migration crisis, could result in the a collapse of the European Union: If Britain leaves, it could unleash a general exodus, and the disintegration of the European Union will become practically unavoidable. Soros added however that the recent strength in the pound was a sign that momentum was behind the remain camp in the referendum debate. I\u2019m confident that as we get closer to the Brexit vote, the remain camp is getting stronger. Markets are not always right, but in this case I agree with them. Turning to other events, there has been more reaction to Wednesday\u2019s shock sessions on BHS, where MP\u2019s quizzed key members of the BHS team about the collapse of the high street retailer. Among other things, the former owner of BHS, Dominic Chappell, was accused of threatening to kill the retailer\u2019s chief executive, Darren Topp. When asked by BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme whether he was surprised by the testimony, Oliver Parry, head of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors got it spot on: \u201cAbsolutely. Who needs Agatha Christie when you have Mr Chappell and the BHS management team yesterday.\u201d Exports grew more than imports in April, triggering a surprise fall in the trade in goods deficit. The news should be a boost to George Osborne, who has long argued that the UK economy would do better to be more reliant on manufacturing and exports, and less reliant on debt-fuelled spending. Back in 2012, the chancellor boldly set a target of doubling UK exports to \u00a31 trillion . The target is looking increasingly out of reach, but the broader ambition remains. You might therefore expect that Osborne would jump on these positive trade numbers, as a sign that his Long-Term Economic Plan is Working. But so far nothing. The Treasury says it is a matter for the Business department. But that doesn\u2019t explain the chancellor\u2019s silence on Wednesday, when official figures took everyone by surprise showing that industrial production grew at the fastest rate in almost four years in April. Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, has a theory about why Osborne remains tight-lipped. [Quick clue: EU referendum.] In Larry\u2019s words: In normal times, George Osborne would have been all over the good news from the manufacturing sector like a rash. The figures from UK industry were better \u2013 a lot better \u2013 than the City had been expecting and showed the fastest month-on-month increase in almost four years. So where was the instant statement from the chancellor praising the strength of the economy and the success of the government\u2019s strategy? Sherlock Holmes would have had the answer. Osborne\u2019s unusual reticence was a classic case of the dog that doesn\u2019t bark. Put simply, good economic news doesn\u2019t really suit the chancellor at the present juncture. His narrative is that the risk of Britain leaving the European Union has left the economy trembling on the edge of the precipice and for that story to stick he needs signs that consumers and businesses are taking fright at the risk of Brexit. Unfortunately for Osborne, the recent data is not at all helpful. Better weather brought consumers out in their droves in May, according to the British Retail Consortium. Now the Office for National Statistics has reported that industrial production was up by 2% between March and April at a time when the markets had expected output to be flat. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, says the figures suggest trade could make a positive contribution to gross domestic product in the second quarter, after being a drag for a prolonged period. April\u2019s data suggests that net trade could actually make a positive contribution to UK GDP growth in the second quarter, having been a significant drag in the first quarter of 2016 and through the second half of 2015. It lifts hopes that UK exporters will increasingly be helped by the overall marked weakening of the pound over the coming months. UK exporters will also be hoping that eurozone activity can hold up after an improved 0.6% quarter-on-quarter GDP expansion in the first quarter. However, the global growth outlook is still pretty uncertain, with the UK referendum on EU membership reinforcing this. More on those trade figures, which were better than expected and showed a surprise fall in the deficit. Goods exports volumes increased by 11.2% - the biggest monthly rise since records began in 1998. At \u00a326.1bn, the total value of goods exported in April was not far off the record high set in June 2013. Exports of British-made goods to the EU rose by \u00a3900m in April, while exports of goods to countries outside the EU increased by \u00a31.3bn to a record \u00a314bn. Andrew Sentance, former policymaker at the Bank of England, considered the annual numbers: Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world fell more than expected in April following a record jump in goods exports. The deficit fell to \u00a310.5bn from a downwardly revised \u00a310.6bn in March according to the figures from the Office for National Statistics. The drop in the deficit was driven by a \u00a32.2bn increase in exports, to \u00a326.1bn. Imports also increased, but by a lesser \u00a32bn to \u00a336.6bn. Benchmark 10-year gilt yields have fallen to record lows, part of a global bonds rally as investors dump shares. Government borrowing costs fell as yields dropped to 1.224%, the lowest on record and down three basis points on the day. German bond yields also fell to near record lows, with the 10-year bund yield down 1.3 basis points at 0.043%. All major markets are down in early trading: Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex, has this take: Despite Brent Crude hitting an 8-month high the European indices got off to a sluggish start this Thursday morning. The FTSE once again fell away from 6300 as the European session began, the index dragged down by chunky losses for the likes of Vodafone, Johnson Matthey and Berkeley Group Holdings. Matters weren\u2019t helped by last night\u2019s Chinese inflation figure, which unexpectedly fell to a 3 month low of 2.0%, something that has arguably muted the impact of Brent Crude\u2019s latest rise on the commodity sector. Draghi is talking about employment trends in the eurozone and warns unfavourable demographic trends will create challenges. Employment growth [is likely] to decelerate in the not-too-distant future because of the fall in the working age population. Even migration is unlikely to fully offset this natural population decline. He says there is room for productivity improvement in all countries, and that the challenge is first to raise productivity in firms and then get capital to those firms so that can grow. That would boost the eurozone economy, and jobs, the central bank says. Draghi finishes will a warning that eurozone leaders must press ahead with structural reforms \u201cwithout undue delay\u201d, or risk lasting economic damage. The cost of delaying reforms, he says, is too high, because it creates damaging uncertainty and holds back investment. There are many political reasons to delay structural reforms, but very few economic ones. And the cost of delay is too high. Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, has taken to the stage at the Brussels Economic Forum. The man tasked with setting monetary policy for the eurozone is laying out some of the measures the ECB has taken over recent years. He says bank balance sheets are not yet fully repaired. He reiterates that governments must do their bit to boost the eurozone economy. The ECB can\u2019t do it alone. Fiscal policies should work with and not against monetary policy. Draghi says doubts over the future of the euro need to be addressed because they are holding back progress in the region. Firms may understandably choose to defer or abandon investment plans. This has been clear in the past when the future of the euro area has been called into question. It can also effect the saving rate of firms and households, leading to higher precautionary [spending behaviour]. There is a critical need for clarity on the institutional make up of the euro area. Many proposals have been put forward to overcome the [shortcomings] of the euro area. Brent crude oil prices have been steadily rising since the beginning of the year... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Oil prices are climbing higher this morning, following larger than expected drawdowns in the US and disruptions to supply in Nigeria, where militant attacks have driven production in the country to a 20-year low. Brent crude is currently trading at $52.70 a barrel, up 0.4%. It is the highest since early October. CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson says there is no sign that the upswing in oil prices is going to end any time soon: While oil inventories still remain at elevated levels continued supply disruptions in Nigeria, have sent output to a 20 year low and this is helping underpin prices. The third successive weekly draw in a row has also helped sustain the uptrend for oil prices which has been in place now for nearly five months. With the US dollar also on the weak side there appears to be little in the way to stop the upward momentum behind the move higher in the oil price. Also coming up today... We have UK trade data for April at 9.30. Economists are predicting the trade in goods deficit to be unchanged at \u00a311.2bn. Mario Draghi is speaking at the Brussels Economic Forum and is due to take the stage shortly. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research will give its verdict on what a UK exit from the European Union would mean for low income households in Britain. In the US, we have the weekly jobless claims data, which will provide the latest snapshot of the labour market following shockingly weak payroll numbers last week. (p.s. If you missed the dramatic events on Wednesday involving death threats and \u201cfingers in the till\u201d at the highest level of collapsed retailer BHS, catch up here.)",

The target is looking increasingly out of reach, but the broader ambition remains.<br></p> <p>You might therefore expect that Osborne would jump on these positive trade numbers, as a sign that his Long-Term Economic Plan is Working. But so far nothing.</p> <p>The Treasury says it is a matter for the Business department. But that doesn\u2019t explain the chancellor\u2019s silence on Wednesday, when official figures took everyone by surprise showing that industrial production grew at the fastest rate in almost four years in April.</p> <p>Larry Elliott, the Guardian\u2019s economics editor, has a theory about why Osborne remains tight-lipped. [Quick clue: EU referendum.]</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/jun/08/why-upbeat-uk-manufacturing-figures-have-silenced-osborne-increase-production-eu\">In Larry\u2019s words:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> In normal times, George Osborne would have been all over the good news from the manufacturing sector like a rash. The figures from UK industry were better \u2013 a lot better \u2013 than the City had been expecting and showed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/08/british-industrial-production-grows-fastest-pace-four-years-manufacturing\">fastest month-on-month increase in almost four years</a>.<br></p> <p>So where was the instant statement from the chancellor praising the strength of the economy and the success of the government\u2019s strategy? Sherlock Holmes would have had the answer.

      "bodyText": "Dong Energy, a Danish company that owns offshore windfarms around the UK, was valued at Kr 98.2bn (\u00a310bn) as it successfully pulled off Europe\u2019s largest stock market flotation this year. The Copenhagen-based group, which employs 700 people in Britain and is in the middle of a transition from a focus on fossil fuels to renewables, saw its shares soar a further 10% after they were sold to new investors at Kr235 each. The Danish government said last month it hoped to see the business valued at \u00a311bn if possible but settled for slightly less only to see both institutional and small buyers keen to pick up for stock after the initial public offering. \u201cThere has been a lot of interest in becoming part of the ownership of Dong Energy, both among retail and professional investors,\u201d Claus Hjort Frederiksen, Denmark\u2019s finance minister, said in a statement. \u201cIt gives Dong Energy a solid foundation to retain and develop its position as one of the leading green energy companies in the world.\u201d The Danish government continues to be Dong\u2019s biggest owner, with just over half of the shares as opposed to 59% before the float while US investment bank Goldman Sachs has reduced its holding from 17.4% to 13.4%. Dong is in good financial shape having reported a 35% increase in first quarter profits last month. The company still has UK gas interests off the north of Scotland but is concentrating new investment on windfarms such as the London Array off the Kent coast. The utility has already invested \u00a36bn in this country and plans to double this spending by 2020 through constructing projects such as the Hornsea Project One windfarm off the east Yorkshire coast. Since the Paris climate change talks there has been renewed interest from a host of oil and gas companies in low carbon investments. Total, of France, recently unveiled a $1bn (\u00a3700m) plan to buy Saft, a company that specialises in batteries which hold the key to electricity storage generated from low carbon sources. Earlier this week, research showed that solar power produced 50% more electricity than coal in the UK during the month of May.",

      "bodyText": "Low-income households are likely to shoulder a disproportionate share of the costs of Brexit if the UK votes to leave the EU in this month\u2019s referendum, a respected thinktank has warned. Under a worst-case scenario, some low-income households could lose as much as \u00a35,542 a year in tax credits and benefit payments in 2020, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. In the first detailed analysis of the possible impact on poorer households from Brexit, NIESR concludes that leaving the EU would mean lower tax receipts \u2013 forcing the government to shake up tax and spending policies to meet tough goals set under George Osborne\u2019s fiscal charter, in order to get the public finances into surplus. Angus Armstrong, one of the report\u2019s authors, said: \u201cOur analysis combines the consensus of macroeconomic forecasts with the spirit of the government\u2019s fiscal charter. Based on these assumptions, our results show that a disproportionately large share of the costs of Brexit is likely to fall on low-income households.\u201d NIESR emphasised that any benefit cuts for low-income households would come on top of other losses that some economists estimate households would suffer from the impact on trade of leaving the EU. Co-author Katerina Lisenkova said: \u201cLow-income households could lose in two ways: their share of the loss of national income plus lower welfare payments in order to meet the spirit of the fiscal charter.\u201d NIESR used various scenarios where the government turns to welfare cuts to varying extents to cover the shortfall in the public finances. In the worst case, where 100% of the burden of achieving a surplus is put on welfare spending, the thinktank calculated that by 2020 different categories of low-income households could receive between \u00a31,861 and \u00a35,542 a year less in tax credits and benefits. Assuming the government places 50% of the burden of adjustment on welfare spending, low-income households \u2013 defined as households receiving tax credits or jobseekers\u2019 allowance \u2013 could receive between \u00a3930 and \u00a32,771 a year less in tax credits and benefit payments in 2020. With just two weeks to go until the 23 June referendum, the NIESR analysis provoked a reaction from leave campaigners who said many economists have overlooked the potential economic benefits from being outside the EU. Patrick Minford, co-chair of the group Economists for Brexit, accused the thinktank of using \u201cflawed Brexit assumptions\u201d in its calculations. \u201cThese assumptions are the worst possible ones for Brexit as they assume the UK continues with EU protectionism after leaving the EU, so that we have even less free trade than within the EU,\u201d said Minford. On his group\u2019s analysis, if the UK gets a World Trade Organisation deal under which it would have the same rights to export to the EU as the US, there would be substantial economic benefits, Minford added. \u201cThere is 4% extra growth, more jobs, and an 8% fall in consumer prices. The public finances are projected to improve. The average household is \u00a340 a week better off. The poorest households, for whom food is a much larger proportion of their budgets, gain proportionately more than 8%.\u201d But NIESR estimated Brexit could put substantial pressure on the public finances and would be likely to force benefits cuts. The thinktank estimated the hit to GDP from Brexit \u2013 based on its own and other previous analyses \u2013 and then calculated the likely effect on the public finances. Under a scenario where leaving the EU takes 3.1% off GDP by 2020 there would be a \u00a344bn fiscal shortfall that year, NIESR estimated. To close the gap, the government would be able to take various steps such as raising taxes and not just cut welfare spending, said the NIESR report. But with areas such as education and health spending ringfenced from cuts, welfare would probably take some of the burden. \u201cIn absolute terms, lone parents with two children stand to lose the most from changes in welfare spending due to Brexit,\u201d the NIESR report concluded. \u201cEven when the welfare budget bears just 25% of the fiscal adjustment to fill the fiscal shortfall due to Brexit, this group stands to lose \u00a31,386 a year in 2020. \u201cAs a percentage of gross annual household income, unemployed individuals stand to lose the most from changes in welfare spending due to Brexit.\u201d NIESR based its analysis on the assumption that the government would continue to target a surplus on the public finances by the end of this decade \u2013 in other words, that over a year it takes in more than it spends. Under the current budget rules, there is some wriggle room on achieving a surplus when economic growth slows sharply. If the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent fiscal watchdog, deems there is a \u201csignificant negative shock to the UK\u201d the surplus target can be suspended and it is quite possible such a case would arise after Brexit. But Armstrong, who is the thinktank\u2019s director of macro-economics, said using the \u201cspirit of the fiscal charter\u201d in this analysis was still valid because even under an economic shock the government would still have to present a plan of how to return to surplus. NIESR said the research was funded by the bank JP Morgan but that the thinktank itself had full editorial control and an agreement with the funding provider to publish the results whatever they showed.",

    "webTitle": "British firm aims to open immigration detention center near US-Mexico border", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The British security firm Serco has moved a step closer to entering the controversial but lucrative immigration detention market in the US, as the company successfully lobbied public officials in a small Texas county near the Mexico border to propose that the federal government open a family detention centre in the jurisdiction. The billion-dollar company, implicated in numerous immigration detention centre scandals in the UK and Australia, has been lobbying the US government for more than a year in an effort to win detention contracts, sparking sustained criticism from immigrant rights groups. The firm is now proposing that a shuttered nursing home in Jim Wells County, Texas, be reopened as a family detention centre, which could hold up to 600 detainees and would become the third privately managed centre in the United States. The Obama administration\u2019s use of family detention centres that hold children and mothers has become one of the most contested elements of America\u2019s border protection program. Serco representatives first approached officials in the county last month, as the company ramped up its lobbying efforts, following an open pitching invitation announced by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in April. On Monday, following a closed-door session between Serco lobbyists and the county\u2019s five commissioners, the local government body voted to partner with Serco and pitch the proposal to Ice. The company has employed a number of experienced lobbyists in America, including a former senior Ice staff member, Kate Mills, and has already listed a job opening for a communications and logistics staff member close to the proposed centre \u201cin the event of a contract award\u201d. Judge Pedro Trevino Jr, the presiding member of the Jim Wells commissioners court, told the Guardian that Serco indicated up to 200 local jobs could be created at the centre. The county, with just over 40,000 residents, has had a spike in unemployment following the decline of the oil and gas industry in the region with the poverty rate climbing to 20%, according to census data. \u201cPeople are most interested in the jobs it would create,\u201d said Trevino, of the county\u2019s reaction to the proposed deal, adding that county attorneys were continuing to research the proposal, wary of the controversy it could bring. \u201cWe know family detention centres are highly controversial and we want to put all our ducks in a row and gather facts before we make our final decision.\u201d Although Ice opened an \u201cinformation\u201d pitching round designed for \u201cmarket research\u201d purposes, it has not yet confirmed if it will move on to receive formal proposals from potential family detention contractors. \u201cThere are several formalities that have to transpire with the [request for proposals] before we can begin to discuss,\u201d an Ice public affairs officer told the Guardian. About 38,000 people were apprehended crossing the US-Mexico border in April alone, including more than 10,000 unaccompanied children and \u201cfamily units\u201d, according to US Customs and Border Patrol. This is the highest number since a surge in arrivals in June 2014, and will add pressure to the already strained detention network. Reports have also indicated that the Obama administration is planning raids that could lead to the detention and deportation of more Central American mothers and children who entered the country illegally. Serco has operated the Yarl\u2019s Wood immigration removal centre in the UK since 2007 and endured a string of abuse allegations, including that members of staff sexually assaulted female detainees. In Australia, where Serco operates all of the country\u2019s mainland immigration detention facilities under a multibillion-dollar contract, the company has suffered sustained criticism after riots have broken out in centres on Christmas Island, dozens of detainees have self-harmed and others have made sexual assault allegations against staff. \u201cTheir actual track record is very different to what they say to people here in the US,\u201d said Mohammad Abdollahi, director of advocacy for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services not-for-profit group in Texas. \u201cThere is no \u2018right\u2019 way to detain families, but they have shown, around the world, everything that is wrong with how you do it.\u201d \u201cSerco has international experience of managing immigration facilities. We are committed to looking after all those in our care with trust and respect,\u201d said a US spokesman for the company in an emailed statement that confirmed Serco\u2019s presence in Jim Wells County. The centre would be the corporation\u2019s first in the United States, completing a triangle of family detention centers in south Texas, where Geo Group operates the 679-bed Karnes County Residential Center, and Corrections Corporation of America runs the 2,400-bed Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley. The only family facility outside of the state is a 96-bed facility in Pennsylvania that is operated by Berks County under an agreement with Ice. Most of the women and children held at the three facilities are seeking refugee status and asylum amid a humanitarian crisis in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services, which operated a pilot \u201calternative to detention\u201d program last year, says it found that housing the families in a less restrictive setting was a more cost-effective way to ensure they attended their immigration court hearings. \u201cWe saw that people seeking asylum have a huge stake in finishing the process that could give them a chance to potentially rebuild their life and live here in safety,\u201d said Brittney Nystrom, LIRS director for advocacy. \u201cWe are creating additional trauma and pouring money down the drain.\u201d",

On Monday, following a closed-door session between Serco lobbyists and the county\u2019s five commissioners, the local government body voted to partner with Serco and pitch the proposal to Ice. </p> <p>The company has employed a number of experienced lobbyists in America, including a former senior Ice staff member, <a href=\"http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/lobbying/lobbyist/mills-kate\">Kate Mills</a>, and has already <a href=\"https://wit.twc.state.tx.us/WORKINTEXAS/wtx?u=1465408456472&amp;pageid=EM_JC_JOB_DETAILS&amp;id=10350431&amp;keyword=Serco&amp;referralPage=BROWSE_POST_BY_TEXT&amp;sort=&amp;pageNo=\">listed a job opening</a> for a communications and logistics staff member close to the proposed centre \u201cin the event of a contract award\u201d. </p> <p>Judge Pedro Trevino Jr, the presiding member of the Jim Wells commissioners court, told the Guardian that Serco indicated up to 200 local jobs could be created at the centre.

Booming sales of top-end TVs, computers and tablets offset a decline in white goods and weaker sales of seasonal products during the chilly spring weather. Sales of computers and tablets were up 7% each, bucking a decline in the market. Furniture and wearable technology such as fitness watches also sold well. John Walden, chief executive of Argos\u2019 parent company Home Retail Group, credited a turnaround in the TV market from last year thanks to the new 4K technology, coupled with a boost from the Euro 2016 football tournament, which starts on Friday. Demand was strong for 4K, also known as ultra HD, televisions, which double the standard resolution, giving a better picture. Like-for-like sales at Argos edged up 0.1% in the 13 weeks to 28 May, the first growth in six quarters. The poor weather is estimated to have reduced sales by 1%. Total sales grew 2.6% to \u00a3868m after new store openings. Internet sales rose 16%, the strongest growth in more than three years, and made up almost half of total revenues in the quarter. Argos introduced Fast Track last autumn offering 20,000 products for immediate store collection or same-day home delivery, and Walden said this was starting to pay off. He said the company remained on track to complete its agreed \u00a31.4bn takeover by Sainsbury\u2019s in the autumn. Walden also acknowledged that the five-month tussle had been \u201cdistracting\u201d but insisted that \u201cmorale is good\u201d. Argos\u2019 strong performance was overshadowed by news that the company had set aside \u00a330m to compensate store card customers who were charged higher penalties for late payments than they should have been. The company discovered the calculation error, which affects less than 10% of its card customers, in the last few days and has yet to write to them. Walden said: \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to understand the scope of and the amount of responsibility we\u2019ve got... We will track them down and we will make it good by them. So for each person it\u2019s not a massive deal but we\u2019ll do what\u2019s right.\u201d Affected customers will get \u201cat the maximum double-digit pounds\u201d each. Walden said: \u201cIt is not a material matter for the business\u201d but he recognised that \u201cfor each customer it matters\u201d. In February, the company took a \u00a317m charge to cover compensation payments to customers, mainly for payment protection insurance. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the \u00a330m charge effectively wiped out the the profit made by the store card division over the last five years. \u201cGiven the pending takeover, the board of Sainsbury\u2019s will probably be shaking their heads at the news, though in the grander scheme of things the sum involved is not enough to derail the deal,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were some encouraging signs at Argos, in particular the strong increase in digital sales. The proposed takeover by Sainsbury\u2019s now looms large in the future of both companies, and could deliver significant benefits, however the outcome of two challenged businesses joining forces still remains very uncertain.\u201d Andrew Stevens, lead analyst at consultancy Verdict Retail, described the transformation at Argos over the past two years as significant, and proves that combining a strong physical presence with a modern online offer is a good defence against solely online or store-only rivals.",
