      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green has agreed to hand over \u00a3363m in cash to rescue the BHS pension scheme, and settle one of the biggest City rows of recent decades. The deal with the Pensions Regulator, which is likely to help the billionaire keep his knighthood, follows the controversial collapse of the BHS department store chain last April, which led to the loss of 11,000 jobs and left a pension deficit assessed at \u00a3571m. A high-profile parliamentary investigation into the demise of BHS concluded that the company had been systematically plundered by its owners and described the hole in the pension fund as \u201cthe unacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. MPs voted in favour of stripping Green of his knighthood. The billionaire tycoon owned BHS for 15 years until he sold it to Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt, for just \u00a31 in March 2015. During his ownership, the Green family and other shareholders collected at least \u00a3580m from BHS in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans. Green said the settlement with the regulator, which is supported by trustees of the BHS pensions scheme, represented a \u201csignificantly better outcome\u201d for former BHS staff than the scheme entering the Pension Protection Fund, the government\u2019s pensions lifeboat. He added: \u201cOnce again I would like to apologise to the BHS pensioners for this last year of uncertainty, which was clearly never the intention when the business was sold in March 2015. \u201cI hope that this solution puts their minds at rest and closes this sorry chapter for them.\u201d The pensions deal should calm the reputational storm which has engulfed Green, the self-styled king of the British high street. The 64-year-old fashion tycoon, who also owns Topshop, Wallis, Miss Selfridge and Burton, has been forced to curtail his public appearances since the scandal, including missing Topshop\u2019s London fashion week show, where he usually has a front row seat. Public anger over Green\u2019s apparent reluctance to address the pensions gap focused on the tycoon\u2019s \u00a3100m 300-foot superyacht, which was delivered as BHS collapsed, along with a new \u00a346m private jet. He lost his temper on TV when approached in a Greek port by journalists and protesters fixed a \u201cBHS Destroyer\u201d banner to the yacht in harbour. The pension settlement comes after the Pensions Regulator started legal action against Green last year in an attempt to force him to contribute cash to the pension scheme. This enforcement action has now been halted against Green, but legal proceedings are continuing against Chappell and his company, Retail Acquisitions, which acquired BHS from Green. Lesley Titcomb, the chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, said: \u201cThe agreement we have reached with Sir Philip Green represents a strong outcome for the members of the BHS pension schemes. It takes account of the interests of both pensioners and the PPF, and brings a welcome level of certainty to present and future pensioners.\u201d Frank Field, the Labour MP who co-led the parliamentary investigation and led the calls for Green to make good the pension scheme, welcomed the deal. \u201cI very much welcome this out-of-court settlement which is an important milestone in gaining the justice for BHS pensioners and former workers that we have been pushing for since beginning our inquiry into the downfall of BHS,\u201d Field said. However, BHS workers are still likely to suffer cuts to their pension benefits. The Pensions Regulator estimates that workers will on average receive around 88% of the value of their original benefits in a new pension scheme created by the settlement. This is a better outcome than if the BHS pension scheme had entered the Pension Protection Fund, a lifeboat for failed pension schemes, where workers would have received an estimated 75% to 79%. Grant Atterbury, a former BHS worker, said the deal was \u201cliterally the least Green could do\u201d. Atterbury is still unemployed and living on benefits after losing his job at the BHS in Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, last August. \u201cThis deal is great news for pensioners but it doesn\u2019t improve my lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is literally the least Green could do. He filled his pockets with a great deal more than he\u2019s putting back into the pension pot. He has filled the black hole in the pension but there are still a lot of black holes including one on our high street. My opinion of him is as low as it was.\u201d John Ralfe, a pensions expert, added: \u201cThis is not Sir Philip Green as the all-conquering hero. This is Sir Philip making the best of a bad job.\u201d Green initially pledged to \u201csort\u201d the problems facing the BHS pension scheme last June when he was questioned by MPs. John Hannett, the general secretary of trade union Usdaw, said: \u201cIt is difficult to understand why this saga has been allowed to continue and why we have had to campaign for so long to get justice for our members.\u201d The Pensions Regulator said measuring the BHS deficit as \u00a3571m was not appropriate when working on a cash settlement because this figure is based on what the retirement scheme would have to pay an insurance company to guarantee its liabilities \u2013 which is expensive. Green has already paid over the \u00a3343m into an escrow account as part of the settlement. An additional \u00a320m will be spent on expenses and implementing the changes to the BHS pension scheme. The deal will see the creation of a new pension scheme, which will be funded by Green\u2019s cash injection. BHS workers will have the option of moving their pension into the new scheme, receiving a lump-sum payment, or remaining in the existing pension scheme, which will enter the PPF and see a 10% cut to existing benefits. As much as \u00a315m could be returned to Green if 90% of the eligible members decide to accept the lump sum. About 9,000 of the remaining 19,000 former staff in BHS\u2019s two pension schemes will be offered the lump-sum payments. Trustees sent an letter to pension members on Tuesday. The members will all be contacted within the next three months with a personal offer and they will have three months to decide what to do with their pension money. The new scheme will be run via a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d and will not be attached to a sponsoring company, which pensions experts claim is risky. It is the first time such a vehicle has been cleared by regulators in the UK and \u00a3100m was added to the settlement to reduce fears about the scheme falling back into the PPF lifeboat in future. Chris Martin, the chair of the BHS pension fund trustees, said the cash injection from Green put the new scheme on a \u201cstable footing\u201d. He added: \u201cThe trustees have carefully considered all aspects of the deal and we are confident that this is a robust scheme that delivers improved and sustainable benefits. \u201cWe are now in a position to confirm that members will be offered benefit improvements, enhanced flexibility, and just as importantly, long-term sustainability for their benefits.\u201d Julie Palmer, managing partner at insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor, said: \u201cPhilip Green\u2019s settlement with the regulator over the BHS pension is a triumph for the regulator and for public pressure, clearly demonstrating that even the most powerful entrepreneurs can\u2019t afford to ignore their responsibilities to pensioners.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Do not run away with the idea that Sir Philip Green has suddenly been overcome by the spirit of generosity. In agreeing a \u00a3363m settlement to top up the BHS pension schemes, he has probably done enough to keep his knighthood but he has not pushed the boat out. The Topshop tycoon is a negotiator in his bones and his skill can be seen in the detail of the agreement. The critical sentence in the Pensions Regulator\u2019s technical explanation was this: \u201cBroadly speaking, on average, the new scheme will offer members benefits of around 88% of the value of their full BHS scheme benefits.\u201d That 88% figure includes assumptions about future inflation rates and the \u201con average\u201d clause covers differences in pensioners\u2019 age, length of service and when that service occurred. But 88% is not 100%. It is merely a better figure than would have prevailed if the BHS schemes had not been hauled out of Pension Protection Fund (PPF), the industry-wide pensions lifeboat. Under the PPF, thinks the regulator, the rate would have been somewhere in the \u201cmid to high 70s\u201d. Put another way, all sides to the negotiation have been pragmatic in the interests of getting a deal done. The PPF wanted to ensure the cost of funding the BHS shortfall did not mean higher levies for solvent schemes. The Pensions Regulator wanted certainty and a better-than-minimum deal it could wave in front of reluctant contributors in future. Green, one assumes, just wanted a clean break in order to keep his knighthood and, by securing official support for the settlement, he is most of the way there. Those MPs who voted for a de-gonging last year may still regard Green as a \u201cbillionaire spiv\u201d but that, in itself, has never been an impediment to receiving a knighthood or a reason for losing one, as the honours committee will surely have to point out. Everybody happy-ish, then? Of course not. The process towards securing the \u00a3363m has been shambolic and has exposed serious flaws in the pensions system. The trouble at BHS began, remember, when Green sold the business in 2015 to Dominic Chappell, a thrice-bankrupt individual lacking the experience or cash to execute a turnaround at a business employing 11,000 people. The sale was absurd and it should now be obvious that the Pensions Regulator must be armed with greater powers to intervene in takeovers when pension schemes are in deficit or when the would-be new owner is a danger to pensioners. The government\u2019s green paper indicated such changes are being considered; it\u2019s time to put them in place. The other moral of the tale is that the real delay at BHS was not the eight-month wait for Green to make good on his promise, issued to parliament last June, to \u201csort\u201d the deficit. Rather, the worst stalling tactics were seen when he still owned a business from which he extracted \u00a3300m in dividends in the early years. In 2012, the BHS pension trustees inexplicably signed off an arrangement whereby the company would take a leisurely 23 years to close a deficit that then stood at \u00a3200m. The regulator should have jumped on that deal and insisted on a shorter timetable. Still, at least Green\u2019s sense of humour is intact. He described his \u00a3363m contribution as \u201cvoluntary\u201d. If you insist, but, come on \u2013 can you honestly say that the dogged work of Frank Field\u2019s and Iain Wright\u2019s select committees had nothing to do with it? Is Southern on track, or off the rails? It will be no comfort to Southern\u2019s beleaguered customers that the parent company is also having a rough ride. Go-Ahead, which owns 65% of Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), operator of the Southern franchise, saw half-year pre-tax profits fall 12% to \u00a367m. The share price plunged 14%. Part of the City, bizarrely, seems to have believed the company could somehow escape unscathed, financially speaking, from the strikes at Southern. Chief executive David Brown had to disabuse investors of that notion. \u201cThe long-running industrial relations issues in GTR have introduced additional costs and delays to expected efficiencies which will result in lower than anticipated profits in the full year,\u201d he said. Indeed, assessing the financial damage is currently guesswork to a significant degree. The company must enter discussions with Department for Transport to determine responsibility for the disruption. Over the course of a full year, the impact on profits could be plus or minus \u00a315m, said Go-Ahead. That\u2019s one hell of a range when you remember these franchise contracts, while notionally huge, run on thin margins. Once upon a time, Go-Ahead expected 3% over the seven-year life of the \u00a31bn-plus a year GTR contract. It revised that down to 1.5% last year and is sticking to the figure \u2013 but presumably with fingers crossed since the profits won\u2019t emerge until the trains started running reliably. From the point of the view of the DfT, that sounds an excellent reason to reject calls to take direct control of the franchise. The government doesn\u2019t possess a magical solution, since it wrote driver-operated trains into the contract in the first place. Nor does it need a financial headache that GTR has an incentive to solve on its own.",

      "body": "<p>Do not run away with the idea that Sir Philip Green has suddenly been overcome by the spirit of generosity. </p> <p>In agreeing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/28/philip-green-agrees-pay-363m-bhs-pension-fund\">a \u00a3363m settlement to top up the BHS pension schemes</a>, he has probably done enough to keep his knighthood but he has not pushed the boat out. The Topshop tycoon is a negotiator in his bones and his skill can be seen in the detail of the agreement.</p> <p>The critical sentence in the Pensions Regulator\u2019s technical explanation was this: \u201cBroadly speaking, on average, the new scheme will offer members benefits of around 88% of the value of their full BHS scheme benefits.\u201d</p> <p>That 88% figure includes assumptions about future inflation rates and the \u201con average\u201d clause covers differences in pensioners\u2019 age, length of service and when that service occurred. </p> <p>But 88% is not 100%. It is merely a better figure than would have prevailed if the BHS schemes had not been hauled out of Pension Protection Fund (PPF), the industry-wide pensions lifeboat. Under the PPF, thinks the regulator, the rate would have been somewhere in the \u201cmid to high 70s\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/28/philip-green-agrees-pay-363m-bhs-pension-fund\">Philip Green agrees to pay \u00a3363m into BHS pension fund</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Put another way, all sides to the negotiation have been pragmatic in the interests of getting a deal done. </p> <p>The PPF wanted to ensure the cost of funding the BHS shortfall did not mean higher levies for solvent schemes. The Pensions Regulator wanted certainty and a better-than-minimum deal it could wave in front of reluctant contributors in future. Green, one assumes, just wanted a clean break in order to keep his knighthood and, by securing official support for the settlement, he is most of the way there.</p> <p>Those MPs who voted for a de-gonging last year may still regard Green as a \u201cbillionaire spiv\u201d but that, in itself, has never been an impediment to receiving a knighthood or a reason for losing one, as the honours committee will surely have to point out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4186426207d51dcee32086eea2c02d02a806d95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4186426207d51dcee32086eea2c02d02a806d95/0_54_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Philip Green\u2019s \u00a3100m yacht Lionheart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Philip Green\u2019s \u00a3100m yacht Lionheart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: livornodailyphoto.blogspot.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everybody happy-ish, then? Of course not. The process towards securing the \u00a3363m has been shambolic and has exposed serious flaws in the pensions system. </p> <p>The trouble at BHS began, remember, when Green sold the business in 2015 to Dominic Chappell, a thrice-bankrupt individual lacking the experience or cash to execute a turnaround at a business employing 11,000 people. </p> <p>The sale was absurd and it should now be obvious that the Pensions Regulator must be armed with greater powers to intervene in takeovers when pension schemes are in deficit or when the would-be new owner is a danger to pensioners. The government\u2019s green paper indicated such changes are being considered; it\u2019s time to put them in place.</p> <p>The other moral of the tale is that the real delay at BHS was not the eight-month wait for Green to make good on his promise, issued to parliament last June, to \u201csort\u201d the deficit. </p> <p>Rather, the worst stalling tactics were seen when he still owned a business from which he extracted \u00a3300m in dividends in the early years. </p> <p>In 2012, the BHS pension trustees inexplicably signed off an arrangement whereby the company would take a leisurely 23 years to close a deficit that then stood at \u00a3200m. The regulator should have jumped on that deal and insisted on a shorter timetable.</p> <p>Still, at least Green\u2019s sense of humour is intact. He described his \u00a3363m contribution as \u201cvoluntary\u201d. If you insist, but, come on \u2013 can you honestly say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/bhs-demise-sir-philip-green-reputation-torn-apart-in-damning-report\">the dogged work of Frank Field\u2019s and Iain Wright\u2019s select committees</a> had nothing to do with it?</p> <h2>Is Southern on track, or off the rails?</h2> <p>It will be no comfort to Southern\u2019s beleaguered customers that the parent company is also having a rough ride. Go-Ahead, which owns 65% of Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), operator of the Southern franchise, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/28/southern-rail-go-ahead-strikes-rmt-union-march\">saw half-year pre-tax profits fall 12% to \u00a367m</a>. The share price plunged 14%.</p> <p>Part of the City, bizarrely, seems to have believed the company could somehow escape unscathed, financially speaking, from the strikes at Southern. </p> <p>Chief executive David Brown had to disabuse investors of that notion. \u201cThe long-running industrial relations issues in GTR have introduced additional costs and delays to expected efficiencies which will result in lower than anticipated profits in the full year,\u201d he said.</p> <p> Indeed, assessing the financial damage is currently guesswork to a significant degree. </p> <p>The company must enter discussions with Department for Transport to determine responsibility for the disruption. </p> <p>Over the course of a full year, the impact on profits could be plus or minus \u00a315m, said Go-Ahead. That\u2019s one hell of a range when you remember these franchise contracts, while notionally huge, run on thin margins. </p> <p>Once upon a time, Go-Ahead expected 3% over the seven-year life of the \u00a31bn-plus a year GTR contract. It revised that down to 1.5% last year and is sticking to the figure \u2013 but presumably with fingers crossed since the profits won\u2019t emerge until the trains started running reliably.</p> <p>From the point of the view of the DfT, that sounds an excellent reason to reject calls to take direct control of the franchise. </p> <p>The government doesn\u2019t possess a magical solution, since it wrote driver-operated trains into the contract in the first place. Nor does it need a financial headache that GTR has an incentive to solve on its own.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nissan has called on the government to provide investment to help rebuild the UK\u2019s car parts business so it can replace components that come from overseas after the country leaves the EU. A Commons select committee was told by a senior Nissan executive that the company was forced to source up to 85% of its components from Japan, China and Europe, as the necessary car parts were no longer produced in the UK. If these parts were made in the UK instead, Nissan would spend up to \u00a32bn a year with British suppliers. Colin Lawther, the company\u2019s senior vice-president of manufacturing supply chain, told MPs on Tuesday that Nissan\u2019s Sunderland plant consumes 5m parts a day for a production line that produces two cars every minute. Lawther said the automotive industry has made a \u201cstrong request\u201d for government support for \u00a3100m to \u00a3140m of investment for a supply development fund to \u201crepower the supply base\u201d and build an indigenous, high-tech car components sector in the UK. \u201cFrom Nissan alone, we would like to spend something like \u00a32bn or more per year on parts from the UK, assembled in the UK,\u201d he said. Nissan is looking to increase content from British suppliers because of the threat of tariffs on components, which can travel several times between the UK and other EU countries during the construction of a vehicle. There are about 5,000 components in the average car and it has been reported that in some cases they cross the Channel as many as 30 times. Lawther said Nissan was looking for a bundle of measures in Brexit negotiations and had made \u201ca strong request\u201d to the government to ensure Britain stayed in the customs union. A World Trade Organisation alternative would be a financial \u201cdisaster\u201d with a 10% tariff on exports costing the company up to \u00a3500m a year, he added. Customs checks on freight in and out of the plant would also be a problem, Lawther said, with every minute factored into the business costs. \u201cTake Sunderland. We hold about half a day\u2019s stock inside the plant itself, and that\u2019s continuously replenished. Every day we use about 5m parts; 5m have to come into the plant, they have to get fitted to the right car and we build two cars every minute,\u201d Lawther said. \u201cWe talk about minutes; we\u2019re talking two, three, four, six minutes\u2019 downtime a day interruption is a disaster.\u201d The overseas content of Nissan cars would have to be reduced by about half if the cars were to be deemed British under WTO rules of origin. Much of the high-tech parts including parking cameras, electronic controls and brake control units come from Japan, with others coming from China and the eurozone. Lawther said Nissan was already talking to Sunderland city council and to the Highways Agency about taking land and investment to provide \u201cthe canvas for suppliers to come\u201d. A local plant would be high-tech, manufacturing everything from high-definition cameras, to electronics and alloy wheels, which currently come from Germany, he said. Theresa May all but ruled out full membership of the EU customs union in her Lancaster House speech setting out her goals for Brexit last month. And speculation that the UK may have to fall back on WTO rules was heightened by her declaration that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d. Lawther denied the company had struck a financial deal with May\u2019s government when it agreed last year to build new Qashqai and X-Trail models in Sunderland. He said that remarks made by the chief executive Carlos Ghosn last year demanding \u201ccompensation\u201d for potential tax barriers post Brexit were misconstrued. \u201cCompensation in terms of what CEO says was misinterpreted; there was not a money connotation, Nissan is not interested in monetary compensation,\u201d Lawther said. \u201cOur point has always been we believe we have to have a competitive business, and business propped up by grants or incentives is not a sustainable business. There is no side letter, no verbal assurances, there is no contingent liability in this letter.\u201d However, Lawther told the Commons international trade committee that the firm would constantly review its decision to stay in Sunderland. The decision to expand in Sunderland was based on a set of circumstances at that point in time, he said. \u201cAs those circumstances change, and we wouldn\u2019t wait until the end of the process, we will continually review the decisions that we take, based on anything that materially changes,\u201d he added. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said his comments showed May\u2019s so-called Brexit deals with Nissan were \u201c[not] worth the paper they were written on\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The company running the Southern rail network has defended its performance on the stricken route, saying it is fulfilling its contract even as it announced a double-digit slump in profits. The boss of Go-Ahead Group, which controls Southern\u2019s operator Govia Thameslink Railway, said the company had acted in the interests of customers although passengers have suffered \u201cawful\u201d commutes. \u201cWe haven\u2019t actually done anything wrong in this contract \u2013 we\u2019ve done the things we were asked to do by the government in the interests of the customers,\u201d said David Brown. In recent months, MPs have called on the government to take over the service, saying that ministers were failing to enforce the terms of GTR\u2019s contract, with hundreds of trains failing to run on time daily amid strike action by staff. Brown was speaking on Tuesday, when Go-Ahead shares fell by almost 14% after the group announced a 13% drop in profits for the first half of the financial year, partly driven by the losses on GTR. Patrick Butcher, the chief financial officer of Go-Ahead, said that GTR had made a loss of about \u00a34m, but could lose as much as \u00a315m over the year dependent on the negotiations. \u201cWe won\u2019t make money on this contract until we start running trains reliably,\u201d he added. Brown insisted \u201cthe issues were down to the strikes, to be blunt\u201d. He said GTR had made significant progress which would benefit customers eventually: \u201cWe\u2019ve introduced more trains than any other franchise in the UK, we\u2019ve got the largest driver recruitment school in Europe, we\u2019ve opened two of the biggest depots in the UK, and we\u2019re the first train operator to introduce delay repay [compensation for passengers] at 15 minutes.\u201d However, he added: \u201cIn terms of the customers there have been awful things that have happened.\u201d He admitted that \u201cin terms of staff engagement, absolutely\u201d the firm could have done things differently, but said the firm had needed to change the railway and ways of working. \u201cI regret we were in that position.\u201d He defended the way the company had pushed through plans to extend driver-only trains and downgrade the role of conductors, which led to the strike on the Brighton to London and Bedford route. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because it\u2019s the right thing for the railways, for taxpayers \u2013 we aren\u2019t doing anything wrong. It\u2019s not my safety case. It was not unreasonable to assume we\u2019d get this through. These are still good jobs paying lots of money.\u201d Brown claimed that, despite the fact that GTR was still officially in dispute with theAslef drivers\u2019 union \u2013 whose members have rejected an agreement struck by GTR with union leaders \u2013 and the RMT union, the service was much improved. \u201cMy postbag has dropped a hundredfold. People are much happier. The number of cancellations is down to single digits.\u201d While Southern ran about 90% of its trains during a one-day strike by the RMT last week, Brown said: \u201cWe do want to reach resolution on these issues, they need to be resolved.\u201d He added that \u201cour door is always open\u201d to the RMT, the union that has led the majority of strikes since last April. But the union said on Tuesday that it had been snubbed by the firm, and called more strikes on Southern on 13 March in the ongoing dispute over the changes to the role and responsibilities of drivers and onboard crew. Mick Cash, the RMT general secretary, said: \u201cThe abject failure by Southern rail to meet with us, to clarify their exact position on the second safety-critical member of staff and to take the safety issues seriously has left us with no option but to confirm further action.\u201d Go-Ahead is still in negotiation with the Department for Transport over its responsibility for disruption on Southern \u2013 including a period of several months in mid-2016 when it operated an emergency timetable, cancelling hundreds of services daily even without strikes. GTR argued that it was unable to run services due to force majeure, citing levels of sickness that it claimed was unofficial industrial action \u2013 a claim being scrutinised by the DfT. While strikes on Southern may have abated, further disruption is likely to continue on GTR from long-term engineering works on the Thameslink service, which should deliver faster, more frequent trains through the redeveloped London Bridge station by the end of 2018.",

He said GTR had made significant progress which would benefit customers eventually: \u201cWe\u2019ve introduced more trains than any other franchise in the UK, we\u2019ve got the largest driver recruitment school in Europe, we\u2019ve opened two of the biggest depots in the UK, and we\u2019re the first train operator to introduce delay repay [compensation for passengers] at 15 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>However, he added: \u201cIn terms of the customers there have been awful things that have happened.\u201d He admitted that \u201cin terms of staff engagement, absolutely\u201d the firm could have done things differently, but said the firm had needed to change the railway and ways of working. \u201cI regret we were in that position.\u201d<br></p> <p>He defended the way the company had pushed through plans to extend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/13/when-where-why-southern-rail-strike-industrial-action\">driver-only trains and downgrade the role of conductors</a>, which led to the strike on the Brighton to London and Bedford route. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because it\u2019s the right thing for the railways, for taxpayers \u2013 we aren\u2019t doing anything wrong. It\u2019s not my safety case. It was not unreasonable to assume we\u2019d get this through. These are still good jobs paying lots of money.\u201d </p> <p>Brown claimed that, despite the fact that GTR was still officially in dispute with theAslef drivers\u2019 union \u2013 whose members have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/16/southern-rail-users-face-more-strikes-as-drivers-reject-aslef-backed-deal\">rejected an agreement</a> struck by GTR with union leaders \u2013 and the RMT union, the service was much improved. \u201cMy postbag has dropped a hundredfold. People are much happier. The number of cancellations is down to single digits.\u201d <br></p> <p>While Southern ran about 90% of its trains during a one-day strike by the RMT last week, Brown said: \u201cWe do want to reach resolution on these issues, they need to be resolved.\u201d He added that \u201cour door is always open\u201d to the RMT, the union that has led the majority of strikes since last April. <br></p> <p>But the union said on Tuesday that it had been snubbed by the firm, and called more strikes on Southern on 13 March in the ongoing dispute over the changes to the role and responsibilities of drivers and onboard crew. </p> <p>Mick Cash, the RMT general secretary, said: \u201cThe abject failure by Southern rail to meet with us, to clarify their exact position on the second safety-critical member of staff and to take the safety issues seriously has left us with no option but to confirm further action.\u201d<br></p> <p>Go-Ahead is still in negotiation with the Department for Transport over its responsibility for disruption on Southern \u2013 including a period of several months in mid-2016 when it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/05/southern-apologises-axes-341-trains-day-new-timetable\">operated an emergency timetable</a>, cancelling hundreds of services daily even without strikes. GTR argued that it was unable to run services due to force majeure, citing levels of sickness that it claimed was unofficial industrial action \u2013 a claim being scrutinised by the DfT. <br></p> <p>While strikes on Southern may have abated, further disruption is likely to continue on GTR from <a href=\"http://www.thameslinkprogramme.co.uk/august-2017\">long-term engineering works on the Thameslink </a>service, which should deliver faster, more frequent trains through the redeveloped London Bridge station by the end of 2018. <br></p>",

Rupert Cowen, a senior nuclear energy lawyer at Prospect Law, told MPs on Tuesday that leaving the Euratom treaty as the government has promised could see trade in nuclear fuel grind to a halt. The UK government has said it will exit Euratom when article 50 is triggered. The treaty promotes cooperation and research into nuclear power, and uniform safety standards. \u201cUnlike other arrangements, if we don\u2019t get this right, business stops. There will be no trade.

We would be crippled without other things in place,\u201d said Dame Sue Ion, chair of the Nuclear Innovation and Research Advisory Board, which was established by the government in 2013. She said movement of the industry\u2019s \u201cbest intellectual talent\u201d was made easier by the UK\u2019s membership of Euratom. The government said it was working on alternative arrangements to Euratom. Describing the notification of withdrawal as a \u201cregrettable necessity\u201d when article 50 is triggered, energy minister Jesse Norman said that the UK saw \u201cclear routes\u201d outside of Euratom to address issues such as the trade of nuclear materials. \u201cWe take this extremely seriously and are devoting serious resources [to looking at new arrangements],\u201d he told the Lords science and technology committee on Tuesday. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said there was a \u201clot to be done\u201d to put in place transitional measures replacing Euratom. \u201cWhat we\u2019re collectively warning about is the potential for there to be a very hard two-year period during which there are lots of other things the government has to deal with, that could leave it in a position where some of these things aren\u2019t in place,\u201d he said. Greatrex said one possible option was an associate membership of Euratom. Over the weekend, the GMB union called on ministers to reconsider their \u201cfoolhardy rush\u201d to leave the treaty, claiming it could endanger the \u201cUK\u2019s entire nuclear future\u201d. But the Office for Nuclear Regulation argued there could even be be some positives to leaving Euratom, such as a reduction in bureaucracy. \u201cIf we relinquish Euratom there would be reduced burden from not having to comply with directives,\u201d said David Senior, an ONR executive.

      "bodyText": "Ahead of the much anticipated address to the US Congress by President Trump later and following slightly disappointing trade and GDP figures, Wall Street has slipped back from its record highs. If the Dow Jones Industrial Average closes at a new record high, it will equal its best ever winning streak of 13 days. But in early trading the Dow is down 18 points or 0.09%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.16% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.12%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here is our story on the BHS pension scheme, from Graham Ruddick: Sir Philip Green has agreed to pay up to \u00a3363m into the BHS pension scheme as part of a cash settlement with the Pensions Regulator. BHS collapsed into administration last April, leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs and leaving a \u00a3571m pension deficit. The collapse of the retailer led to a high-profile parliamentary investigation and calls for Green to be stripped of his knighthood. Green said the settlement represented a \u201csignificantly better outcome\u201d for former BHS staff than the scheme entering the Pension Protection Fund, a lifeboat for failed pension funds. The Pensions Regulator started legal action against Green last year in an attempt to force him to contribute cash to the pension scheme. This enforcement action has now been halted. The full story is here: Sir Philip Green has agreed to pay \u00a3363m to rescue the BHS pension scheme from the pension protection fund. The slightly underwhelming US data is not likely to hinder further rate rises from the Federal Reserve this year, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research, but perhaps not in March. Its senior economist Oliver Kolodseike said: Although slightly disappointing, the release in unlikely to significantly change the mood at the Federal Reserve Bank. With durable goods orders and retail sales data beating expectations, thereby adding to signs that the US economy is picking up pace again at the beginning of this year and inflation nearing a five-year high, Cebr is pencilling in three rate hikes in 2017 and we see May as the most likely starting point for the process of normalising monetary policy. We believe that Fed chair Janet Yellen will use the March meeting instead to prepare markets for a move at the following meeting, after the Fed last year faced some criticism for some unclear communication about interest rates. That said, recent comments from policymakers suggest that the door remains open for a potential rate rise when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meet on March 15th. The February Jobs Report is published a few days before the meeting and could potentially steer policy makers towards a rate hike sooner rather than later... We currently project the US economy to grow 2.4% in 2017 which would be stronger than the 1.6% rate seen in 2016, and above the average trend since the financial crisis. Of course, much depends on the extent to which the US government can implement reforms. The US trade deficit was also worse than expected. The advance January goods trade balance came in at -$69.2bn, compared to estimates of -$66bn and December\u2019s figure of $64.4bn. The US economy grew by less than expected in the final three months of 2016, according to new figures from the Commerce Department. With Donald Trump promising a \u201crevved up\u201d economy, the last growth figures under the old administration showed GDP rising by an annualised 1.9% in the fourth quarter. This was in line with initial estimates, but less than the 2.1% expected by economists and well below the 3.5% seen in the third quarter. For the whole of 2016, the US economy grew by 1.6%, as expected, its worst performance since 2011. The Commerce Department said: The increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE), private inventory investment, residential fixed investment, nonresidential fixed investment, and state and local government spending. These increases were partly offset by negative contributions from exports and federal government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. The deceleration in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily reflected a downturn in exports, an acceleration in imports, and a downturn in federal government spending that were partly offset by an upturn in residential fixed investment, an acceleration in private inventory investment, and an upturn in state and local government spending. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high for the twelfth trading day in a row on Monday, and is two days off its longest ever winning streak. If it closes higher on Tuesday it will equal the 13 day run in January 1987, and a similar move on Wednesday will see it set a new record. At the moment, the US futures are indicating a flat open, but much will depend on how investors feel ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s address to Congress after the market closes - and their reaction to what he has said when trading begins on Wednesday. There is also the small matter of some new US data due shortly, in form of growth and trade figures. Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments, said: Economists have been forecasting a growth rate of 1.6% for 2016, something which the current government has constantly criticised as being too pessimistic. The trade deficit is also expected to widen to $66 billion, from $65 billion in December, which may be used by the administration as supporting arguments for protectionism. More from Trump: Back with Trump, and in his Fox interview he is asked how he will fund the extra spending on defence. He is told that saving money from the environment and state department budget is not enough to cover his proposed increases. He says, \u201cWell, I think the money is going to come from a revved up economy. \u201cI mean you look at the kind of numbers we\u2019re doing, we were probably GDP of a little more than 1% and if I can get that up to three or maybe more, we have a whole different ball game...And that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to do.\u201d Here he previews the topics for his address to Congress later: As flagged earlier, the British Chambers of Commerce is holding its annual meeting in London at the moment, and our politics live blog is covering the appearances from George Osborne and John McDonnell, and the other attendees. You can follow all the action here: President Trump is giving an interview on Fox News ahead of his address to Congress later. In the pre-recorded interview, he was asked whether the $54bn increase in defence spending he was proposing was enough, and he said it could be $30bn more, but he would be involved in negotiating the contracts. \u201cThere are many boats and planes we are, individually spending too much on...We will get a lot more product for our buck....We saved $700m plus on a F35 after I got involved... We saved a lot of money on aeroplanes and that money will substantially increase.\u201d Here\u2019s our report of a pre-released segment where Trump accuses Barack Obama of organising protests against him. Over in Greece bailout monitors are resuming a stalled compliance review that recently reignited fears over the country\u2019s ability to remain in the euro. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: In a long-awaited moment for Greece, the anxiously awaited return of monitors has finally begun. This morning, inspectors representing the European Commission, euro zone bailout fund, IMF and European Central Bank all filed into the finance ministry to discuss energy reforms, fiscal issues and privatizations. Testing Athens\u2019 compliance with agreed reforms is at the heart of the review, a review that once completed will be key to releasing the \u20ac7bn plus the country requires to honour debt repayments in July. But, so too, are differences over a raft of new reforms that creditors want Athens to adopt once its current three-year \u20ac86bn rescue programme in August 2018. Without further pension cuts and tax hikes, the IMF does not think Greece will be able to achieve the high primary surplus of 3.5 % that eurozone lenders are demanding as of next year. The monitors, who are backed by technical teams, are keen to make enough progress so that the IMF \u2013 which has advised but not formally signed up to the bailout \u2013 finally participates in the programme. For leading lenders such as Germany and the Netherlands, IMF oversight is key to easing concerns in an electoral year that good money is not being thrown after bad when it comes to Greece. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras believes the review can be concluded by March 20 when the eurogroup next meets. Auditors have signalled they do not wish to be in Athens for more than a week. But it is a tight deadline that many also recognise will be a tall order. Although both sides will be working on an initial agreement reached in Brussels last week, a great deal of bargaining over the type of counter measures Athens can expect to reduce the impact of further cuts is likely to dominate the days ahead. Lenders also want to liberalise the energy and labour markets \u2013 reforms that are highly controversial for leftists in the governing Syriza party. \u201cOur hope is that we can deal with collective bargaining and other sensitive issues after we have made enough technical progress to complete the review,\u201d said one Syriza insider. \u201cThere is a feeling that we are being pushed a great deal but the alternative [euro exit] would be worse.\u201d In South Korea, more problems for Samsung. Justin McCurry reports: The acting head of Samsung is to be indicted on bribery and embezzlement charges connected to a corruption and cronyism scandal centring on South Korea\u2019s impeached president, Park Geun-hye. Lee Jae-yong and four other Samsung executives will almost certainly face trial over accusations that South Korea\u2019s biggest conglomerate donated millions of dollars to foundations run by a close friend of Park\u2019s in exchange for government favours. Later on Tuesday, Lee, who is officially Samsung\u2019s vice-president but has in effect run the company since his father suffered a heart attack in 2014, will be charged with bribery, embezzlement, hiding assets overseas and committing perjury before parliament, prosecutors said on the final day of their investigation into a scandal that has rocked the country\u2019s political and business worlds. The four executives, who all face the same charges as Lee except perjury, are the Samsung group\u2019s vice-chairman, Choi Gee-sung, and president, Chang Choong-ki, as well as Samsung Electronics\u2019 president, Park Sang-jin, and executive vice-president, Hwang Sung-soo. Some of the executives will resign and leave Samsung, but Lee is expected to stay on as de facto head of the company if there is a trial. The full story is here: Over in Europe and there has been a strong rise in Italian inflation, which is likely to boost the overall eurozone figure: Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 first take on Charlotte Hogg\u2019s appearance at the Treasury Committee: Bank of England Deputy Governor Charlotte Hogg, who will join the central bank\u2019s top policy committees next month, said on Tuesday she would be able to stand up to BoE Governor Mark Carney if required. Hogg, who is currently the Bank\u2019s chief operating officer, also said she did not think there was a culture of group-think at the Bank. Asked by a committee of lawmakers if she thought she would be able to stand up publicly to Carney, Hogg said: \u201cI do.\u201d She said she had already had disagreements with Carney in her current role over staffing and organisational issues. Hogg replaces Minouche Shafik as deputy governor for markets and banking. She will serve on the Bank\u2019s monetary, financial and prudential regulation policy committees. Charlotte Hogg is up before MPs being quizzed about her appointment as the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor. (There is a live link here) She says low interest rates are a global phenomenon and not just in the UK. The prospect of an imminent US rate rise is supporting the dollar, and putting a dampener on any chance of the pound regaining lost ground. Sterling is currently virtually flat at $1.2440 having earlier fallen to $1.2413. Against the euro the pound is down 0.05% at \u20ac1.1743. Back with the US, and the chances of an interest rate hike at the Federal Reserve\u2019s March meeting are increasing, whatever Donald Trump may announce about his tax and spending plans. On Monday, Dallas Fed president Robert Kaplan - who had previously said a rise should come sooner rather than later - clarified his point at a meeting in Oklahoma: Sooner rather than later means in the near future. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, believes the Fed should get on with it. He said: For the last few weeks markets have been weighing up the prospect of whether the US Federal Reserve will look to raise rates at its March meeting. The odds of a move have fluctuated between lows of 24% at the beginning of February and a peak of 44% in the wake of Fed Chief Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony to US lawmakers on Capitol Hill when she said that it would be \u201cunwise\u201d to wait too long before raising rates. Since that January Fed meeting it has been clear that the US economy has continued to show signs of improvement, and while the probability of a Fed rate rise has now risen to 50%, certain members of the committee appear paralysed by concerns about what the new US President might look to do with respect to his tax and fiscal policy... Today the President is due to address a joint session of Congress, and it is clear that we can expect to see him flesh out in greater detail of his new fiscal plans, with the eyes of the markets and the world on him, and with US markets continuing to push to new record highs on an almost daily basis. We already know that he intends to spend $54bn on defence and infrastructure whilst making cuts elsewhere to pay for them. Is the US economy so weak that a 25 basis point rise on the upper band from 0.75% to 1% will spook investors? I think not. Fed policymakers have already acknowledged that a substantial fiscal boost in terms of tax cuts could prompt a much sharper policy response which would suggest that irrespective of what Mr Trump announces today higher rates are already needed, so why wait? Improving its product range - away from just sausage rolls and pasties and on to healthier items - has helped food retailer Greggs beat expectations with its full year figures. But signs of a slowdown in like-for-like sales so far in the current year have knocked its shares back more than 3% to 980p - albeit they have risen 10% in the past three months. Overall, profits for 2016 rose 105 to \u00a380.3m, compared to forecasts of around \u00a379m. Like for like sales climbed 4.2%, and while the company said trading in the current year was in line with expectations, like for like sales slowed in the eight weeks to February 25, up 2%. Analyst Darren Shirley at Shore Capital said: Current like for like trading in the 8 weeks of the year-to-date has been subdued relative to recent years, with company managed like for like sales up 2.0% (said to be 2.9% excluding the New Year trading pattern), which is said to be inline in-line with management expectations. However, total sales are reported up 5.8% which is ahead of our full year expectation of 4.8%, so Greggs are a little ahead of our expectations at this still early stage of the year. Another big faller in Moneysupermarket.com, down 11% after its final results. It reported a 16% rise in profits but warned revenues in the current year were below those in 2016, partly due to low interest rates weakening savings and current account switching, and falling trade in the energy business. Liberum analysts said: MoneySupermarket has reported 2016 results this morning and given the full year trading update in January there were no surprises with regards to headline numbers. Our concern with Moneysupermarket has always been that revenue growth is linked to marketing spend and therefore margins could come under pressure going forward as competition in the price comparison website space intensifies. These results have realised our concerns, increased marketing spend drove the majority of the 520 basis point decline in gross margins to 74.8%. Trading for 2017 is behind 2016.... management has also guided gross margins to be 73% for 2017 which is 300 basis points below Liberum estimates of 76%. Bus and train operator Go-Ahead has warned on its outlook, mainly due to the continuing strike actions on Southern Rail. It said its full year expectations were lowered due to \u201cchallenges in GTR [which runs the Thameslink, Great Northern, Southern and Gatwick Express rail franchises] and a slowdown in passenger numbers in regional bus.\u201d On the strike, which has inconvenienced and angered commuters for months, it said: Lengthy and significant industrial relations issues at GTR related to the modernisation of working practices, required by the contract, have caused months of disrupted travel. We are working towards a resolution so we can provide a reliable service for customers. Rail profits for the half year fell by 35% due to the Southern dispute, and the company\u2019s overall profits dropped 11.7% to \u00a367m. Even so, the company has raised its dividend to shareholders by 6.5%, justfied by \u201cstable bus profits.\u201d That has failed to save its share price, however, which is down 14% at \u00a319.66. Analysts at Investec said: Go-Ahead has reported half year results broadly in line with our forecasts at the divisional level, with the exception of GTR which was weaker due to industrial action. However, expectations for the full year have been lowered given the slowdown in passenger volumes in Regional Bus, higher insurance costs and additional costs and delays to expected efficiencies for GTR as the industrial action is ongoing. We therefore reduce our forecasts, cut our target price to 2300p and lower our recommendation to add. Jefferies, which remains a buyer of the shares, has cut its 2017 profit forecast by 4% and its 2018 prediction by 7%. As expected, the record close on Wall Street has given a lift - albeit a slight one - to European shares. The FTSE 100 is up 0.06% in early trading, Germany\u2019s Dax has opened 0.2% higher, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.4%, Spain\u2019s Ibex 0.5% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB 0.3%. Over in France, and the country\u2019s economy grew by 0.4% in the final quarter last year, in line with initial estimates. So overall for 2016, it grew by 1.1%, also unchanged from the first estimates. Elsewhere: A positive start is expected in Europe after yet another record breaking run in the US: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The US is in focus today, with trade figures for January and the final reading for fourth quarter GDP. The trade deficit is expected to widen to $66bn from $65bn in December, something which is likely to exercise President Trump with his protectionist tendencies. As for GDP, analysts expect an annualised rate of 2.1% for the quarter, up from 1.9%. Overall the US economy is forecast to have grown at 1.6% in 2016, a growth rate Trump\u2019s team have consistenty criticised as too slow. But Republican financial John Bogle, who founded the world\u2019s second largest investment group Vanguard, told the BBC\u2019s Wake up to Money that Trump\u2019s plans to grow the US economy at 4% annually were unlikely to succeed. He said: There are certain limits, irrespective of whoever sits in the White House. He added that building trade barriers would be madness and reducing immigration would harm the US economy. Meanwhile, after the US markets close - at 9pm Washington time, 2am GMT - Trump will be making his long awaited address to Congress with the promise of spelling out some of his plans in detail. We already had a flavour on Monday, with Trump\u2019s talk of increased defence and infrastructure spending, probably at the expense of the environment and foreign aid. But it seems that Trump\u2019s \u201cphenomenal\u201d tax reforms might have to wait. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, said: Was there any disappointment yesterday when some details were released ahead of Mr Trump\u2019s most anticipated speech? Well, yes. It turns out that we are not going to receive any details about the anticipated tax plan and the timeframe for said plan is also vague. All we know is that it will happen sometime after a new healthcare bill replacing Obamacare has been introduced, again, something we have yet to receive a date for. This was not something the markets were expecting especially after rousing the rally by describing his tax plans as \u201cphenomenal\u201d. What we saw last night was disappointment across the board when the news hit. But it would be wrong to write off Mr Trump yet, as he is never short of surprises. Despite his lack of information, the market rallied, recording another record high. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high for the twelfth day in a row, and European markets are expected to open higher as a result. Also on the agenda, the British Chambers of Commerce holds its annual conference in London, with regional development and Brexit on the agenda and appearances scheduled from former chancellor George Osborne, mayoral hopefuls Andy Street and Andy Burnham and shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Elsewhere Charlotte Hogg will be at a Treasury committee hearing to discuss her appointment as the Bank of England\u2019s Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking. And there are results from Go-Ahead and Greggs.",

From Athens, Helena Smith reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>In a long-awaited moment for Greece, the anxiously awaited return of monitors has finally begun. This morning, inspectors representing the European Commission, euro zone bailout fund, IMF and European Central Bank all filed into the finance ministry to discuss energy reforms, fiscal issues and privatizations. </p> <p>Testing Athens\u2019 compliance with agreed reforms is at the heart of the review, a review that once completed will be key to releasing the \u20ac7bn plus the country requires to honour debt repayments in July. But, so too, are differences over a raft of new reforms that creditors want Athens to adopt once its current three-year \u20ac86bn rescue programme in August 2018.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"596c6fd4d730c3a585d78c66979677278d388db8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/596c6fd4d730c3a585d78c66979677278d388db8/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos arrives for talks with bailout inspectors about Greece\u2019s bailout progress.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos arrives for talks with bailout inspectors about Greece\u2019s bailout progress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thanassis Stavrakis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Without further pension cuts and tax hikes, the IMF does not think Greece will be able to achieve the high primary surplus of 3.5 % that eurozone lenders are demanding as of next year. The monitors, who are backed by technical teams, are keen to make enough progress so that the IMF \u2013 which has advised but not formally signed up to the bailout \u2013 finally participates in the programme. </p> <p>For leading lenders such as Germany and the Netherlands, IMF oversight is key to easing concerns in an electoral year that good money is not being thrown after bad when it comes to Greece. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras believes the review can be concluded by March 20 when the eurogroup next meets. Auditors have signalled they do not wish to be in Athens for more than a week. </p> <p>But it is a tight deadline that many also recognise will be a tall order. Although both sides will be working on an initial agreement reached in Brussels last week, a great deal of bargaining over the type of counter measures Athens can expect to reduce the impact of further cuts is likely to dominate the days ahead. Lenders also want to liberalise the energy and labour markets \u2013 reforms that are highly controversial for leftists in the governing Syriza party. \u201cOur hope is that we can deal with collective bargaining and other sensitive issues after we have made enough technical progress to complete the review,\u201d said one Syriza insider. \u201cThere is a feeling that we are being pushed a great deal but the alternative [euro exit] would be worse.\u201d </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b5523ae4b05f755cc0d2e0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-28T10:39:37.367Z\">10.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In South Korea, more problems for Samsung.

Trading for 2017 is behind 2016.... management has also guided gross margins to be 73% for 2017 which is 300 basis points below Liberum estimates of 76%. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58b53000e4b08ddc9a5e4678\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-28T08:20:39.497Z\">8.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Southern Rail operator Go-Ahead slumps 14% after results</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bus and train operator Go-Ahead has warned on its outlook, mainly due to the continuing strike actions on Southern Rail.</p> <p>It said its full year expectations were lowered due to \u201cchallenges in GTR [which runs the Thameslink, Great Northern, Southern and Gatwick Express rail franchises] and a slowdown in passenger numbers in regional bus.\u201d On the strike, which has inconvenienced and angered commuters for months, it said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lengthy and significant industrial relations issues at GTR related to the modernisation of working practices, required by the contract, have caused months of disrupted travel.

The trade deficit is expected to widen to $66bn from $65bn in December, something which is likely to exercise President Trump with his protectionist tendencies. As for GDP, analysts expect an annualised rate of 2.1% for the quarter, up from 1.9%. Overall the US economy is forecast to have grown at 1.6% in 2016, a growth rate Trump\u2019s team have consistenty criticised as too slow.</p> <p>But Republican financial John Bogle, who founded the world\u2019s second largest investment group Vanguard, told the BBC\u2019s Wake up to Money that Trump\u2019s plans to grow the US economy at 4% annually were unlikely to succeed. He said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are certain limits, irrespective of whoever sits in the White House.</p> </blockquote> <p>He added that building trade barriers would be madness and reducing immigration would harm the US economy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, after the US markets close - at 9pm Washington time, 2am GMT - Trump will be making <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2017/02/25/president-donald-j-trump-address-joint-session-congress-first-time\">his long awaited address to Congress </a>with the promise of spelling out some of his plans in detail. We already had a flavour on Monday, with Trump\u2019s talk of increased defence and infrastructure spending, probably at the expense of the environment and foreign aid.</p> <p>But it seems that Trump\u2019s \u201cphenomenal\u201d tax reforms might have to wait. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Was there any disappointment yesterday when some details were released ahead of Mr Trump\u2019s most anticipated speech? Well, yes. It turns out that we are not going to receive any details about the anticipated tax plan and the timeframe for said plan is also vague. All we know is that it will happen sometime after a new healthcare bill replacing Obamacare has been introduced, again, something we have yet to receive a date for. </p> <p>This was not something the markets were expecting especially after rousing the rally by describing his tax plans as \u201cphenomenal\u201d. What we saw last night was disappointment across the board when the news hit. But it would be wrong to write off Mr Trump yet, as he is never short of surprises. Despite his lack of information, the market rallied, recording another record high.<br></p> </blockquote> <p>Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high for the twelfth day in a row, and European markets are expected to open higher as a result.</p> <p>Also on the agenda, the British Chambers of Commerce holds <a href=\"http://www.bccconference.co.uk/programme/\">its annual conference in London</a>, with regional development and Brexit on the agenda and appearances scheduled from former chancellor George Osborne, mayoral hopefuls Andy Street and Andy Burnham and shadow chancellor John McDonnell.</p> <p>Elsewhere Charlotte Hogg will be at a Treasury committee hearing to discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/09/charlotte-hogg-bank-england-deputy-governor\">her appointment as the Bank of England\u2019s Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking.</a></p> <p>And there are results from Go-Ahead and Greggs.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-28T08:03:31.585Z\">at 8.03am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Ofcom has slammed telecom providers for offering landline-only customers poor value for money, as it unveiled plans to force BT, the dominant provider, to cut bills by at least \u00a35 a month, benefiting about 2.3 million people. The regulator has reviewed how the market is working for customers who buy only a landline service from a provider \u2013 either because they do not want broadband or pay TV, or because other companies provide these services. Ofcom said the customers, who tend to be elderly people who have been with BT for decades, were getting \u201cpoor value for money\u201d. The watchdog aims to force BT to cut its standalone line rental by \u00a35 to \u00a37 a month which means customers with only a landline, who currently pay \u00a318.99 a month, would pay no more than \u00a313.99 \u2013 a reduction of at least 26%. The price cut would not apply to landline services sold by BT as part of a bundle of services including broadband. BT accounts for nearly 80% of the landline-only market of 2.9 million people. At the start of the review in December, Ofcom said BT and Virgin Media had the highest line-rental charges, followed by TalkTalk and Sky. At the time, Virgin Media launched a \u201cTalk Protected\u201d plan which freezes line rental for elderly and disabled customers at \u00a317.99. Ofcom expects other providers who benchmark prices against BT to follow suit and cut landline rental charges. The regulator\u2019s investigation closes in May. It will announce a final decision towards the end of the year. Consumer groups and the Labour party welcomed Ofcom\u2019s move. Tom Watson, shadow secretary of state for culture, media and sport, said: \u201cThis landline rip-off can\u2019t go on any longer. It\u2019s a scandal that service providers have increased landline prices year on year despite benefiting from significant decreases in wholesale costs. \u201cLandlines are important to households across the country, and the elderly and vulnerable in particular. We need to see a fairer deal for consumers and the government must act to put safeguards in place to prevent future increases above inflation.\u201d Citizens Advice called for similar action in other markets such as energy. Its chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: \u201cLoyal customers often pay much more for their essential bills. People who stay with the same phone, broadband, gas and electricity supplier are getting a raw deal \u2013 as firms know they are less likely to shop around to get a better price.\u201d BT said about half of its landline-only customers take broadband from another provider such as Sky, and it writes to them to persuade them to switch to a package with BT. The company stressed it took its responsibilities in this area \u201cvery seriously\u201d, saying: \u201cUnlike other companies, we have many customers on special tariffs for socially excluded or vulnerable customers, including BT Basic.\u201d The phone service is aimed at customers on certain state benefits such as jobseeker\u2019s allowance and pensions credits. It costs \u00a35.10 a month, which includes \u00a31.50 worth of free calls a month, with monthly call charges capped at \u00a310. BT added that it had recently frozen the cost of line rental for all customers. Providers have increased line rental charges by between 25% and 49% in real terms (adjusted for inflation) in recent years \u2013 even though the underlying wholesale cost of providing a landline service has fallen by 26%, Ofcom found. The price cut would return the cost of line rental to 2009 levels in real terms, reversing price hikes for landline-only customers. Ofcom is also proposing safeguards to prevent BT from making inflation-busting increases to line rental and landline call costs in future. It wants the company to trial different approaches for communicating with landline-only customers to help them better understand what they are paying and that other packages might offer better value for money. Sharon White, Ofcom\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cLine rental has been going up, even as providers\u2019 costs come down. This hurts people who rely on their landline the most, and are less likely to shop around for a better deal. We think that\u2019s unacceptable. \u201cSo we plan to cut BT\u2019s charge for customers who take only a landline, to ensure that vulnerable customers get the value they deserve.\u201d While customers of bundled services \u2013 packages including landline, broadband and/or pay-TV \u2013 can choose from a range of deals due to strong competition, offers for landline-only customers have become limited, with a number of providers withdrawing those products. Ofcom publishes information to help landline customers choose the right tariff to match their use. This includes information on the low-cost services available for customers who receive certain state benefits. It also offers advice on switching landline provider.",

      "bodyText": "Ticket resale website Viagogo has been accused of trying to manipulate online reviews as it contends with a flurry of negative publicity. The company is the focus of a campaign by more than 100 customers who say they suffered financial hardship after Viagogo allegedly overcharged them and then withheld refunds. Viagogo has also been criticised for seeking to profit from charity by reselling tickets to an Ed Sheeran gig in aid of the Teenager Cancer Trust. Just days after its actions were revealed in the Guardian, Viagogo emailed 37,000 customers who used the service nearly a decade ago. It offered them the chance of a \u20ac100 (\u00a385) voucher if they posted reviews on Trustpilot, a website that allows consumers to share their experiences. Nobody who joined the Victim of Viagogo group on Facebook, which has 105 members in 11 countries, has said they received the email. The Facebook group has secured nearly \u00a340,000 in refunds but says at least \u00a327,000 more is outstanding. Members of the group have told the Guardian that they struggled to make ends meet and suffered considerable stress. Group founder Claire Turnham is to meet MPs this week to ask that Viagogo be brought before a select committee, with an evidence session understood to be pencilled in for mid-March. Turnham said: \u201cI am not aware of anyone within our group who has been contacted by Viagogo and asked to provide a review to Trustpilot. Had they been, I am confident they would have shared how buying tickets through Viagogo has been a distressing, shocking and frustrating experience which they would advise anyone else to avoid.\u201d Those customers who did receive a request for a review appear to be limited to those who attended events about a decade ago, before an upsurge in complaints. \u201cWe ask companies to invite all or none of their customers to review,\u201d Trustpilot\u2019s guidelines state. \u201cIf that\u2019s not possible, companies must select an equally impartial system \u2013 such as inviting every third customer.\u201d Viagogo, which pays Trustpilot nearly \u00a330,000 a year according to an invoice seen by the Guardian, declined to comment. But a Trustpilot spokesperson said Viagogo claimed that it \u201caccidentally\u201d sent the requests for reviews, which are now being removed. Viagogo\u2019s email offered customers a place in a \u20ac100 prize draw in return for a comment on Trustpilot. Trustpilot says its review pages always make clear whether companies are offering financial incentives, but no such information appeared on Viagogo\u2019s listing. The website said it was not aware that Viagogo was offering financial incentives and that its compliance division would look into the matter. \u201cIf we find that any company is violating our guidelines, we investigate and take appropriate action,\u201d it said. A spokesperson for FanFair Alliance, which campaigns for reform of ticketing, said: \u201cViagogo enables the industrial-scale rip-off of British audiences, makes a mockery of UK consumer law and even profits from charity tickets. \u201cIt is a business without ethics. Little wonder it has to manipulate its own reviews.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Australia Post chief executive, Ahmed Fahour, has labelled Pauline Hanson\u2019s comments about his religion \u201csad\u201d and said he \u201cfeels sorry\u201d for her for making them during the national furore about his $5.6m remuneration package. In evidence to Senate estimates on Tuesday, Fahour denied resigning due to external pressure but acknowledged he was prepared to do \u201canything it takes\u201d to protect the company in the face of an onslaught of criticism. Fahour resigned last Thursday after a rolling controversy about his salary stoked in part by Hanson. He maintained he had left at a time of his choosing, but on Tuesday acknowledged that criticism of his pay had \u201csharpened his mind\u201d about the timing of his departure. The Australia Post chairman, John Stanhope, told the committee the board had received a letter from the communications minister, Mitch Fifield, and the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, asking it to consider the matter of Fahour\u2019s pay, but denied being otherwise pressured by the government to cut executive pay. Fahour said he did not resign \u201cbecause of pressure from anybody\u201d. Guardian Australia reported last week Fahour and the board of Australia Post was told by the government in mid-February the chief executive needed to take a pay cut or action would be taken against the board. Asked on Tuesday if he left out of fear the board would be sacked, Fahour said that was \u201chistory now\u201d. \u201cI will do anything it takes, within the law, to protect this brand and the employees of this company.\u201d Fahour was asked about Hanson\u2019s comments that she has a problem with his religion \u201cif he\u2019s actually a fundamentalist and follows the Koran to the letter, which I think denigrates women\u201d. The Australia Post chief executive said the comments were \u201cill-informed\u201d and \u201cvery hurtful\u201d to himself, his wife and four children. \u201cWe love our country \u2013 I love our country so much. I\u2019m grateful for every opportunity it has given our family. \u201cSo I feel sorry for Hanson that she feels the needs to say those things.\u201d Fahour said the comments were \u201csad\u201d but he did not believe other senators shared Hanson\u2019s views. Hanson has denied her political attacks on Fahour had anything to do with racism, or objections to his religion. Despite Hanson\u2019s trenchant criticism of Fahour\u2019s generous remuneration package, the One Nation leader was not present for Tuesday\u2019s Senate estimates hearing \u2013 which was noted by other members of the committee. Fahour was asked whether his departure from Australia Post triggered a termination payment. He told the committee he structured his departure as a resignation so it would not trigger a termination payment. \u201cThere\u2019s no golden handshake, there\u2019s no watch, I hope I\u2019ll get a stamp though,\u201d he quipped. Before Fahour\u2019s testimony, Fifield said he had a conversation with Stanhope shortly after he became minister in September 2015 at which he commented that executive pay was a matter that drew attention from time to time. Stanhope could not recall the conversation but said it had \u201cprobably\u201d happened. Stanhope recalled a conversation with then-communications minister Malcolm Turnbull shortly after September 2013 at which Turnbull queried why executive pay was so high at Australia Post. Stanhope said it was to attract executive talent, because Australia Post is a parcel business that competes with commercial operators. Stanhope conceded it was a mistake for Australia Post not disclose the CEO\u2019s pay when the regime changed in 2015 and no longer required it. When asked if he agreed it was a mistake, Fahour said it was not a matter for him, but he accepted it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that non-disclosure had added to a perception that Post lacked transparency. Earlier in the day, Fifield told the committee he had only \u201cgeneral awareness\u201d of Fahour\u2019s remuneration arrangements before they were made public and became the subject of controversy. Asked whether he was sorry the Australia Post CEO had resigned , Fifield replied: \u201cEveryone has to move on at some point.\u201d Labor and the Greens pushed Fifield about why the government had taken action against executive remuneration at Australia Post, by enlisting the Remuneration Tribunal to establish the parameters of the CEO\u2019s package in the future \u2013 but had taken no action in other comparable government businesses, such as the national broadband network. The Labor senator Sam Dastyari told Fifield during the hearing he believed the government had done the right thing by ensuring executive pay at Australia Post would be lower in the future, \u201cI just think you should do it at the NBN as well.\u201d Fifield shrugged off that suggestion, saying the circumstances of the two businesses were quite different. He said there was strong competition to attract a CEO with experience in the telecommunications sector to run the NBN, while Australia Post was a \u201cmature\u201d and not very complex business. Fifield also faced pressure during the hearings from the Greens. The Greens treasury spokesman, Peter Whish-Wilson, confessed to feeling \u201cfascinated\u201d why Fahour had been \u201cthrown under the bus\u201d when other chief executives of government businesses seemed to face no public pressure, even though they were paid substantial salaries. Asked whether Hanson had played any role in Fahour\u2019s departure, given she campaigned strenuously against his remuneration once it was made public on social media channels, Fifield replied: \u201cWe march to the beat of our own drum.\u201d The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, asked Fifield whether Fahour\u2019s faith and ethnicity were factors in the controversy. \u201cNo,\u201d Fifield replied.",
