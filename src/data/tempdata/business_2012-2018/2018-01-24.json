      "bodyText": "Theresa May will use a speech to business leaders in Davos on Thursday to urge shareholders to pressure social media giants such as Twitter and Facebook to do more to tackle terrorism. May flew to the Swiss ski resort for the World Economic Forum on Wednesday after prime minister\u2019s questions in the House of Commons. She will call for more action from tech companies to identify and take down extremist content and say investors have a responsibility to pressure them to clean up their act. \u201cInvestors can make a big difference here by ensuring trust and safety issues are being properly considered. And I urge them to do so,\u201d she will say, citing a recent case in which Facebook and Twitter shareholders called for the platforms to take tougher action. May is expected to say: \u201cThese companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content.\u201d The prime minister has repeatedly returned in recent months to the issue of tech companies\u2019 role in facilitating terrorism and extremism, including at the UN general assembly in September. The government acknowledges that progress has been made \u2013 with firms identifying and taking down extremist content more quickly, for example. But it would like to see more action taken. May will say: \u201cWe need to go further, so that ultimately this content is removed automatically. These companies have some of the best brains in the world. They must focus their brightest and best on meeting these fundamental social responsibilities.\u201d She will also single out the messaging app Telegram, which has been accused of facilitating communication by terrorists. \u201cJust as these big companies need to step up, so we also need cross-industry responses because smaller platforms can quickly become home to criminals and terrorists. We have seen that happen with Telegram. And we need to see more co-operation from smaller platforms like this. No one wants to be known as \u2018the terrorists\u2019 platform\u2019 or the first choice app for paedophiles,\u201d she will say. May will also meet the US president, Donald Trump, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum \u2013 the first time the pair have met since they clashed over his sharing of videos from the far-right group Britain First. A report from Bloomberg News on Wednesday cited senior insiders saying that when the pair speak on the phone, Trump \u201ctotally dominates the discussion, leaving the prime minister with five or 10 seconds to speak before he interrupts and launches into another monologue\u201d. But Downing Street sources insisted the pair have a good relationship and suggested they would be likely to discuss foreign affairs, including North Korea and Iran, rather than the possibility of a Trump visit to Britain. May\u2019s 2017 trip to Davos, home of the global elite, raised eyebrows, as it followed criticism of her \u201ccitizens of nowhere\u201d comment in her first party conference speech as prime minister. This year the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will also be speaking at Davos. He issued a statement on Wednesday saying he would use the trip to issue \u201ca warning to the global elite\u201d. McDonnell added: \u201cjust as Davos faces the risk of an avalanche this week, growth for a few risks a political and social avalanche unless there is fundamental change to our rigged economic system.\u201d Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was invited to Davos but declined to attend. \u201cHe chooses to go to events where he thinks he can make an effective contribution and it\u2019s appropriate for him to go,\u201d his spokesman said. \u201cThe Davos event has become representative of a system and set of global elites which have clearly failed, a system that clearly isn\u2019t delivering for people.\u201d Labour said McDonnell would make clear that he believed the global economy was being mismanaged. \u201cThe large majority of the success in taking hundreds of millions of people out of poverty is in one part of the world, namely China,\u201d the spokesman said. Asked if the country was a good example for the UK, he said: \u201cChina and Britain are entirely different countries at different stages of development with entirely different economic and political systems.\u201d In Davos, McDonnell will speak on a panel on Friday morning, as well as meet various charity executives, his office said.",

      "bodyText": "There are two jaw-dropping aspects to the nauseating circus at the Dorchester, AKA the last (thankfully) Presidents Club annual dinner. One is that the event took place in 2018. Even in the early 1990s, a business dinner of this type would have been seen as deplorable, or at least that would have been the official line from the companies and organisations these men represent. Therein lies the second astonishing feature: the hypocrisy of rich businessmen parading their equal opportunities credentials during the working day and then pitching up to a hideous sleaze-fest in the evening. They will rationalise it, of course, by saying they were off duty, that it was a private event for charity, and that they are as appalled as anyone by allegations of sexual harassment. Come on, though, the \u201cwe\u2019re shocked\u201d line doesn\u2019t wash. This was a men-only dinner where 130 \u201chostesses\u201d in short skirts were paraded on stage and the auction lots included a night at a strip club and a course of plastic surgery to \u201cadd spice to your wife\u201d. Being surprised that female staff were groped, harassed and propositioned during a booze-fuelled evening is like being shocked that gambling took place in a casino. As for the charity angle, it\u2019s absurd. WPP\u2019s Sir Martin Sorrell, who was not at the event, called it \u201cregrettable\u201d that his firm was withdrawing support from a Presidents Club \u201cthat has done a lot of good work\u201d. Why have regrets? You can still donate money to Great Ormond Street and children\u2019s charities if you wish. Or try sponsoring a fundraiser where debasement is off the menu. Then there\u2019s the private-life defence. Yes, we all have one. But if you are, say, Tim Steiner, co-founder and chief executive of Ocado, you\u2019re taking a risk with your company\u2019s reputation if you attend a dinner that will appal most of your staff and customers. \u201cThere\u2019s a mindset that runs through Ocado like a stick of rock: a willingness to do the brave thing, the hard thing, the right thing,\u201d says the corporate website. Mr Steiner bravely declined to comment. The depressing, as opposed to merely shocking, part is that a couple of decades of boardroom sermonising about corporate responsibility may not have achieved as much as thought or hoped. Most male bosses, it is still possible to believe, would run a mile from the Presidents Club shindig. But then you read some of the readers\u2019 comments on the FT expos\u00e9 and you wonder whether misogynist attitudes still run deep in the business world. Many readers applauded their paper\u2019s reporting, but more than a few were indignant. Here\u2019s a sample: \u201cI\u2018m amazed by the puritanical tone of this piece\u201d, \u201cwhere does the FT get the audacity to violate the civil liberties of President Club members to report on their behaviour?\u201d, \u201cthis overly sensitive, childish, shallow zealous leftist hysteria is getting really silly\u201d, \u201cwould prefer for the FT to stick to what it\u2019s best at, and revealing society stories are not part of that\u201d. A society story? Perhaps it is \u2013 a story of a society of 360 men who have just destroyed another chunk of that \u201ctrust in business\u201d they so often preach about. Stone digs in at Crest Stephen Stone, chief executive of Crest Nicholson, could be excused if he no longer wanted to continue in the job. He has done it since 2005, he has been on the board since 1999 and he will be 64 next week. He has overseen thrills and spills at the housebuilder, including an over-leveraged buyout that went badly and a triumphant return to the stock market in 2013. Conditions for the sector look good and Crest is trading well, so this would be the ideal moment to take a bow. Well, Stone is off, but he\u2019s not going far \u2013 just to the chairman\u2019s seat. This is a serious governance no-no since the UK corporate governance code is clear: \u201cA chief executive should not go on to be chairman of the same company.\u201d The principle of \u201ccomply or explain\u201d applies but the company\u2019s explanation isn\u2019t convincing. It\u2019s the usual one about wanting to retain \u201cexpertise\u201d. OK, but in doing so, Crest is running the risks the code tries to address \u2013 insularity and lack of challenge in the boardroom. Crest reckons it can cope by hiring a new deputy chairman, Leslie Van de Walle, plus two more non-execs. Stone has also said he will limit himself to three years as chairman. It\u2019s still not obvious, though, why Patrick Bergin, the new chief executive, can\u2019t just be allowed to get on with the job without his long-serving predecessor on his shoulder; Bergin has already done a full year warming up as chief operating officer. Crest says it has had \u201can extensive consultation\u201d with its shareholders, which is not quite the same as claiming full support. At least one top-15 investor is sceptical. Last year\u2019s pay report at Crest was rejected by a 58% majority. That\u2019s not a great position from which to appeal for loyalty.",

      "bodyText": "Some late news: Seven Latin American countries are to benefit from a new anti-malaria initiative unveiled in Davos by the philanthropist Bill Gates and the Inter-American development bank. The Regional Malaria Elimination Initiative is expected to deliver more than $180mn to fight the disease in Belize, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. Money from the Gates Foundation, the IDB and the Carlos Slim totalling more than $80bn is expected to leverage in a further $100mn from the countries affected. Gates said: \u201cThis collaboration will build on each of the partners\u2019 unique capabilities and expertise to cover financial and technical gaps in the region, demonstrating that we can eliminate malaria today using current tools. It will also help strengthen health systems in the region, positioning countries for success against other high-priority vector-borne diseases such as Zika, dengue and Chikungunya.\u201d More Macron reaction: I think the social contract has to involve all the stakeholders. We have to fight against strategy of free riding. A new global and shared framework should be based on co-operation and multilateralism..We have a tremendous responsibility.. The answer is partly here in this room. In a way our new frontier is our commitment. If we commit ourselves to make our current globalisation more fair..so we can converge and build a new globalisation. We have a question. Do we decide to do it or no? And this is now? (Applause as he ends) We are committed to fighting against terrorism. We need to continue to work with our partners at military and diplomatic levels... Sometimes we thought getting rid of a tyrant we didn\u2019t like would get what we wanted... But we have to win the war against terrorism and create conditions for a durable peace...We need to provide a development and education policy. I think we have to reconnect with a framework which provides for the common good. Sustainable development, health, human rights - these can never be renounced, and we have to spell them out and regulate them in a common manner. I hope private sector will come to our country to create jobs.. but I have to explain to people [globalisation] is good for them. Otherwise there will be nationalists, extremism. We need to establish a new global contract, unless everyone understands they have a part to play it won\u2019t work. The new global contract has three duties: the right to invest, share and protect. [On investment} one area we are not doing enough in is education, we have 750m adults who do not have basic literacy skills, we have to invest in education, the education of girls in particular. If we don\u2019t invest there will be not equality. It is important all the countries here commit to this [investment in education globally]. The duty to share: there is a crisis of contemporary capitalism. It has become a capitalism of superstars, spreading of value added is not equitable. We have to establish mechanisms to share value added more equitably... We also need to speak about gender equality. In France we are launching initiatives [for more visibility], I welcome the commitments from Justin Trudeau. If we want to share value better, we need a more co-ordinated tax approach at a global level. There should not be a race to the bottom. We need a strategy that avoids the maximisation strategies of some companies. It is a moral issue. We need to renounce unbridled tax optimisation. Plus how can you have a tax on digital activities. We all want these big international companies in their country, but there is an unfair model [if they pay low taxes when national companies do]. Disruption from digital businesses will destroy millions of jobs, and if those companies do not help finance retraining of people affected, how can I explain that [to those people] I am in favour of IMF being given mandate to survey whole financial system, especially those areas which escape regulation. Cryptocurrencies, shadow banking etc, are not being looked at by IMF, so we have to have a discussion. At what point are we going to stop innovation. To say artificial intelligence, this is a red line. We need to have a framework of international co-operation to promote technology, but also to decide principles which should be decided by government not private companies. Finally, protection, against terrorism, and financial protection. Need government and international co-operation for this. We need to have a discussion in G20, that there must be a monitoring of all those bodies which can promote social cohesion. In terms of climate protection, we have committed to many things but not up to the commitments. China has done an enormous amount of work here. India is also very important. But we now need to follow through and respect Paris agreement. Need a floor price for CO2, if not we won\u2019t be credible. China\u2019s new Silk Road has to be a green road. I hope by 2020 we will have an environmental pact which is legally binding. The private sector must also live up to its commitments. Finally it is the financial system which has to accompany this with green financing. In EU and eurozone we need to have a way of having a green financial sector. Macron, who has been mostly been speaking in English, reverts to French. Europe should find a new ambition. Economic growth is not an end in itself. We\u2019ve made a mistake saying things will get better because we have growth. The search for growth has sometimes made us forget what it takes to achieve it. Some people thought that if we had growth, all problems will be solved. Not the case, because this growth is less equitable. You cannot have a one stop solution. You have to co-ordinate positions. Everything is being fragmented. We have societies made up of nomads. There are more and more people who think getting out of globalisation is the right option. We have a major challenge, not just for governments. A lot of governments think you have to be more nationalist. States have often gone in wrong direction because we undermined internationalism. For many years we have been going in the wrong direction. In terms of trade we are moving back to strategies of non-co-operation, undoing what globalisation has been able to achieve. For climate change we have not be able to achieve what we have said we would achieve. And we haven\u2019t established an organisation at a world level which looks at artificial intelligence and automation. We allow private companies to control this. We have never had a multilateral approach to this. We are encouraging technological change..and we are in danger of living in a Darwinian world. My message is France is back. We will never have French success without European success. Angela Merkel expressed her vision and we worked very closely in that direction. The core strategy is: we have to fix some short term measures. But we have to also redesign a ten year strategy for Europe. Europe has a role to play vis a vis China and the US. If we want to avoid fragmentation of the world, we need a stronger Europe. We have to have a 10 year strategy to make Europe a green, scientific and political power. We need more ambition to have a more united Europe. I\u2019m not naive, we will not build something that ambition at 27. But we have to change our methodology, not wait for all the people round the table to go forward, Those who do not want to move forward should not block the most ambitious people in the room. This will make our eurozone much stronger, fairer. At the end of this year, we hope for a common strategy for ten years. First, its about human capital. Our world has changed. We need less arms and more brains. People have to be trained in an efficient way. We began to reform our education system, we need better access to university. We invest 5% of GDP in education, we will reform apprenticeships. We will invest \u20ac15bn in education and retraining over five years. We will make innovation the centrepiece of the economy. Reform fiscal mechanisms, create a new \u20ac10bn fund for disruptive technologies. The second pillar of this reform is investment and capital. We need more equity to finance risk and big innovations. We passed reforms to reallocate our savings in this direction. By decreasing corporate taxes, big reform on capital gain. We have reinforced France\u2019s attractiveness. The third pillar is acceleration and flexibility. You need more flexible structures and rules to help different companies to change business model and readapt. The idea is to realign France on Germany and northern Europe. Rules much more adapted to business environment, that is a big change and it makes us much more competitive. Fourth pillar - make France a model in fight against climate change. That is a huge advantage in terms of attractiveness and competitiveness. Talent will come where it is good to live. We can create a lot of jobs with such a strategy. We passed reforms for this green strategy. Close coal fired power stations by 2021 (Applause). Fifth pillar of domestic strategy is cultural change. A preference for red tape cuts and cutting complexities. We simplify and streamline processes, and simplify bureaucracy. During last six months we reduced like crazy the number of regulations. We have to guarantee stability for people. We passed all these measures, voted these five year strategy on taxes. Visibility is the strategy and will not change, that is my commitment. It is also about risk. In France it was forbidden to fail, and forbidden to succeed. Now it should be more easy to fail, take risk, but allow people to come back and try something else. When you take risk, you need reward, and you need to reduce the cost of failure. France is a nation of entrepreneures, ao it was a mistake in France\u2019s history. We have taken action but let us not be naive. Globalisation is going through a challenge. I came here to make a call for action, to all and every one of us. France has been affected by change and globalisation. A few months ago I had to fight with a nationalist party, since there was a lack of understanding about globalisation in my country. Why, we didn\u2019t deliver, results were poor. Some people proposed getting out of globalisation as a solution. I have the responsibility to build a France that is prosperous and open, but also standing for those left behind. I have to make France more competitive to finance a fair system. Macron says we are talking about globalisation in a place cut off from the rest of the world by snow. It is hard here to believe in global warming, and you didnt invite anyone sceptical of global warming this year. Applause. A video clip has emerged of David Cameron, former UK PM, describing Brexit as \u201ca mistake, not a disaster\u201d: French president Emmanuel Macron is next up at Davos. Today is being billed as a \u201cmoment of truth\u201d by Greek government officials as prime minister Alexis Tsipras meets his Macedonian counterpart in Davos. A solution to the seemingly unsolvable dispute between Greece and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia could be solved in Davos. That, at least, is what both sides are hoping as Tsipras and his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev meet this afternoon. The bilateral meeting takes the quest for a settlement a notch up the diplomatic scale and is being seen as possibly groundbreaking. The two Balkan neighbours have been at odds over the former republic\u2019s name for the past 25 years with Greece\u2019 asserting that exclusive use of the nomenclature \u201cMacedonia\u201d conceals territorial ambitions against its own eponymous region of Macedonia. Around 100,000 demonstrators protested over the issue in the northern Greek capital of Thessaloniki on Sunday. \u201cIt will be a moment of truth,\u201d said a senior Greek official adding that it would allow Athens to see how far Skopje was willing to compromise on the issue. More on the pound\u2019s current buoyancy, and more to the point, the dollar\u2019s decline. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The pound went on a tear this Wednesday, rocketing higher against the euro and dollar to mark the currency\u2019s best session for more than a month. Cable shot up a remarkable 1.6% as the day progressed, clearing not only $1.41 but $1.42 in one fell swoop. Though the UK jobs report was decent, the highlight being another minor fall in unemployment, the thrust of cable\u2019s growth is coming from the dollar\u2019s bruised and battered start to 2018. Despite ostensibly having the end of the US government shutdown to cheer about the dollar found little room for positivity this Wednesday, almost solely due to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u2019s appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos. At a press conference Mnuchin argued that a weaker dollar was better for the US economy for trade reasons, a comment that was tantamount to kicking an already very sickly dog. Combine that lack of policy support with a weaker than forecast US flash services PMI and a disappointing existing home sales number and the greenback gave up the ghost as the bell rang on Wall Street, plunging to a variety of fresh lows as it matched its sharp decline against the pound with a 0.8% drop against the dollar and a 1% slide against the yen. Of course these currency movements had major ramifications for the global indices. The Dow Jones was overjoyed at the dollar\u2019s latest defeat, jumping 160 points to soar to a brand spanking new record peak of 26375. The European markets, on the other hand, shrank in the face of the pound and the euro. With sterling not only destroying the dollar but rising 0.8% against the euro the FTSE took the brunt of the blows, falling to a 3 week low after dropping 0.7%. The DAX and CAC, meanwhile, both slipped 0.3%, despite the euro\u2019s 3 year high-hitting gains against the dollar being tempered by its losses against sterling. More US data, and a weak housing market report for December. Existing home sales fell by 3.6% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57m units, worse than the 2.2% decline which had been expected by analysts. The November figure was revised down from 5.81m to 5.7m units. The December fall came after three months of gains, and the National Association of Realtors attributed the decline to a shortage of houses at the lower end of the market. But for the year as a whole, sales rose 1.1% making it the best performance in eleven years. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said: Existing sales concluded the year on a softer note, but they were guided higher these last 12 months by a multi-year streak of exceptional job growth, which ignited buyer demand. At the same time, market conditions were far from perfect. New listings struggled to keep up with what was sold very quickly, and buying became less affordable in a large swath of the country. These two factors ultimately muted what should have been a stronger sales pace. NF We\u2019ve had the initial January PMI numbers for January for the US, and unlike Europe it is manufacturing which is outperforming, rather than the service sector. The IHS Markit manufacturing PMI has climbed from 55.1 in December to 55.5, while the services PMI slipped from 53.7 to 53.3. The composite index edged down from 54.1 to 53.8. Despite the dips, all the indices were above 50, showing expansion rather than contraction. IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson, said: January saw an encouraging start to the year for the US economy. Business activity across the manufacturing and service sectors continued to expand, driving further job gains as companies expanded capacity. Manufacturing is faring especially well, in part thanks to the weaker dollar, providing an important spur to the economy at the start of the year. Although the overall pace of economic growth signalled by the surveys waned to an eight-month low, the forward-looking indicators suggest the slowdown will prove transitory. In particular, business optimism about the year ahead improved markedly and inflows of new orders hit a five-month high. Growth should therefore pick up again in coming months. Inflationary pressures meanwhile kicked higher, with January seeing the second-largest monthly increase in input costs since 2015. Higher oil prices were widely reported but, more generally, stronger demand is also helping companies push through price hikes. NF US markets have hit new records in early trading, helped by reasonable results from a number of major companies and the continuing weakness of the dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a high of 26,344, up more than 0.4%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.25% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.19%. NF A quick look at the pound versus the dollar and the euro since the EU eferendum, courtesy of the Press Association, and it is quite a contrast: NF Returning to the dangers of populism, Angela Merkel warns of the \u2018poisonous mix\u2019 created if people feel they are getting an unfair deal. She warns against descending into stereotypes, saying: When you say Americans are protectionist by nature, Germans are tight-fisted by nature, you are generalising. The next thing is Muslims are like this, Christians are like that. If you not respect each person\u2019s individuality, and already have your pre-conceived notion before you even talk to them, that is the very basis of populism. We want to have a good partnership with Britain in the future, Merkel continues. Access to the single market is contingent on the freedoms, including freedom of movement. It\u2019s in their hands how close they want the partnership to be. We are prepared to be open-minded about this partnership. Angela Merkel now turns to the digital revolution, warning of the social damage that it could cause. It\u2019s not enough to just convince 20% or 30% of the population of the benefits of the digital age. Policymakers need to help people who will otherwise be left behind, she says. The chancellor repeats her earlier point that we must avoid making the mistakes of the 20th century again. The new digital economy creates good opportunities, Merkel says, but it also creates \u201cenormous confusion, and people feel left behind\u201d We must create a true social market economy as we say in Germany in this digital age. Merkel ends with a request - keep your fingers crossed for us getting into government as soon as possible. Are you listening, Donald? Turning to Brexit, Angela Merkel says Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union is regrettable. But on the upside, it has given Europe \u201cthe courage to move forwards\u201d. She also name checks France\u2019s new(ish) leader, Emmanuel Macron, saying his victory last spring has given a new impetus to Europe\u2019s reform drive. Merkel is making some important points about Europe\u2019s role in the world: Angela Merkel warns that populism is on the rise, with a \u201cpolarising state of affairs in many countries\u201d. The German chancellor cites the \u201cdisruptive changes of technology\u201d, which is shaking up society and worrying people. There is also polarisation in Germany for the first time in decades, Merkel continues - following the eurozone crisis, and challenge of migration. Merkel reminds us that she is still holding talks to form a new government (with the social democratic party). But she\u2019s certain that Germany wants to make a contribution to solving the problems of the world. Shutting ourselves off from the rest of the world will not help she says, adding: Protectionism is not the proper answer. Next up: German chancellor Angela Merkel take the stage. She reminds delegates that 2018 marks the 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war. The political actors a century ago \u2018sleepwalked\u2019 into a crisis, Merkel says. We must ask ourselves...have we learned the lessons of history, Merkel continued. And she suggests we have not, declaring: This generation born after the second world war will have to prove they have learned the lessons of history. That means remaining committed to multilateralism, working together to solve problems, Merkel continues. Taking questions, Italian PM Paulo Gentiloni says that the issue of migration had a big influence on the Brexit vote. Italy is sticking to its principles, though, he says - saving the lives of those who try to get to Europe, and refusing to close its ports to those who cross the sea. Gentiloni says: This is one of the more costly political decisions you can take in these times. but this is the Italian decision, full stop. And finally, Donald Trump speaks to Davos in two days time - what is your message to him. \u201cWelcome to Davos\u201d, Gentiloni wisecracks. But he then makes a serious point - that there is a limit to how far any one country can push things within the current framework. Yes you can defend and protect your citizens, your workers, your companies, but we live in a framework of trade agreements, free trade, international rules, multilateral decisions, and we have to keep this system running. Turning to new technology, Gentiloni says that digital innovation is threatening the quantity and quality of available jobs. We must not give in to the idea of a world destined to be split between a cosmopolitan digital elite and an army of precarious and underpaid local workers. And on Europe, the Italian PM says that the \u201cperfect storm\u201d caused by the Brexit vote, the economic crisis and unchecked migration is over. The EU now has an opportunity to relaunch itself. Gentiloni says firmly: These years are now behind our back. Those who have bet on a final crisis of the European Union have clearly lost. Italy is doing its bit to help with the migration crisis, Paulo Gentiloni says, saying that Italian investment is helping the African economy. The Italian PM then reminds his audience that Italy has an election in 40 days - he hopes that populist forces will not prevail [unfortunately for Gentiloni, his Democratic party is lagging in the polls]. Populism, Gentiloni says, frequently gives the wrong answers to the right questions. Politicians must not ignore the \u2018deep causes\u2019 of discontent among their citizens, he says There are still unacceptably large parts of our populations who feel unsatisfied with their conditions and worried about the future. The damage caused by the great recession has still not been mended, Gentiloni continues. Economic growth is not reducing inequalities, but in many countries including Italy they are still widening, even if economic growth is there. They are reaching even more intolerable levels. Italian PM Paulo Gentiloni is on his feet - telling Davos that Italy\u2019s economy is improving. Gentiloni says: In the last two years, our economy is back to growth, and now it\u2019s picking up speed. One year ago, the IMF forecast that we would only grow by 0.7% in 2017. Actual growth in 2017, according to the IMF, was 1.6%. He adds: Exports rose by 9.7% between November 2016 and 2017. Employment is up by one million units, to a 40-year high. Gentiloni says his government is doing its best to improve the business conditions, reform the labour market, raise skills and cut bureaucracy. This reforming effort must continue, and will continue, while our public debt must decrease at a steady and sustainable pace. There\u2019s a buzz in the main Davos congress hall, as delegates prepare to hear from Italian prime minister Paulo Gentiloni, and then German chancellor Angela Merkel. Jack Ma has also warned Davos that technology could trigger a third world war, unless leaders work together to mitigate its disruptive effects. He says: \u201cThe first technology revolution caused the First World War and the second technology revolution caused the Second World War - and now we have the third. \u201cIf there is a Third World War I think that should be a war against disease, pollution and poverty, not a war against ourselves. \u201cIf we don\u2019t align together , human beings are going to fight each other, because each technology revolution makes the world unbalanced.\u201d Hopes of a showdown between Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker at Davos tomorrow have been dashed. The EC president has cancelled his visit after contracting stomach flu, so he won\u2019t be giving his scheduled speech tomorrow. Here\u2019s another quote from Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma, urging policymakers not to trigger a trade war: \u201cGlobalization is a growing pain. It is so easy to launch a trade war but it is so difficult to stop a trade war and I\u2019m scared and concerned.\u201d Sterling is climbing higher again, now up more than 1% at $1.4152. Apart from the weak dollar, one of the reasons for the pound\u2019s strength at the moment is the prospect of further UK interest rate rises, hence a 0.7% gain against the euro to \u20ac1.1464. The stronger than expected employment and wage growth numbers only add to that expectation. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, says: While the Bank of England had initially responded to the risks to demand from the Brexit vote by easing its policy in August 2016, it became increasingly data dependent over the course of 2017, eventually hiking its main policy rate by 25bp in November \u2013 the first hike in a decade. This came as a bit of a surprise for markets that seemed to be focusing more on downside risks to demand from Brexit than the signs of growing underlying inflationary pressure. According to market pricing, the BoE is set to hike the bank rate once again towards the end of the year. In our view, this seems still seems inconsistent with the BoE\u2019s data dependant approach and outlook for GDP and wage growth. Economic growth is likely to remain robust, partly helped by the strong global backdrop. Meanwhile, the BoE expects the unemployment rate to remain below its estimate of full employment (4.5% unemployment) throughout its forecast. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the BoE to justify its ultra-accommodative policy stance. We therefore look for two hikes in the Bank Rate in 2018, one in Q2 and one in Q4, followed by one in Q3 2019. Even with a modest continued tightening in which the Bank Rate increased to 1.25% by the end of 2019, UK monetary policy would remain highly accommodative. We will be paying close attention to the forward guidance at the February Inflation Report for signs the BoE is preparing markets for another rate hike soon. Daniel Vernazza, economist at UniCredit, is less hawkish on rates but admits today\u2019s data could make a rise this year more likely: We continue to expect the MPC will keep the stance of monetary policy on hold this year and only hike again once Brexit-related uncertainty is resolved, probably in 2Q19. However, today\u2019s labour market release, together with the likelihood of a robust 4Q17 GDP report due to be published on Friday, stronger global growth, and some resolution of Brexit-related uncertainty, increases the risks that the MPC already delivers another 25bp hike later this year. Meanwhile here\u2019s our full story on the day\u2019s UK data: NF One of the attractions of Davos for the global elite is that they can squeeze in more meetings with fellow leader than in the average month. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has been showing the way; offering support to Lebanon over its refugee crisis and giving Portugal a thumbs-up too. She even squeezed in a chat with cellist Yo-Yo Ma. E-commerce magnate Jack Ma has made a passionate plea to world leaders t Davos not to launch a trade war. Speaking on a panel, the head of China\u2019s Alibaba says trade should be a solution to the world\u2019s problems. If you used it as a weapon, young people and businesses will suffer most. Ma says: \u2018They will be killed, just like when you bomb somewhere\u2019. An important view, given the tensions between China and the US - and Wilbur Ross\u2019s comment about America \u2018coming to the ramparts\u2019. Back in Davos, the World Economic Forum have launched a new \u201cGlobal Centre for Cybersecurity\u201d Based in Geneva, it\u2019s meant to help build a safe and secure global cyberspace, and protect businesses and governments from online attacks. Interpol and BT are also involved. J\u00fcrgen Stock, Secretary General of Interpol, says this partnership will address the \u201cglobal threat\u201d of cybercrime. The pound has peaked at $1.4118 against the dollar, for the moment at least. But it is still up 0.7% so far today at $1.4097. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A green-gilled greenback and a half decent UK jobs report made for a very strong Wednesday for the pound. Kicking the currency while it was down, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claimed at a press conference in Davos that a weaker dollar is good for the country\u2019s economy \u2018as it relates to trade and opportunities\u2019. This turned an already bad morning worse for the greenback, with the currency falling 0.4% against the euro, where it\u2019s sunk to a fresh 3 and a bit year nadir, and 0.7% against both the yen and the pound. Sterling\u2019s gains against the dollar caused cable to flit about the $1.41 mark for the first time since the Brexit referendum result back in June 2016. The pound didn\u2019t stop there, however; it also rose 0.4% against the euro, lifting back to its best price in just shy of 7 weeks. The FTSE wasn\u2019t best pleased with all this, dipping 0.2% as it continued to shed its early 2018 record-breaking momentum. The pound was aided by a UK jobs report that by and large didn\u2019t ruffle any feathers. Wage growth came in unchanged at 2.5%, and rose to from 2.3% to 2.4% excluding bonuses \u2013 in terms of its relation to inflation, though real wages are still being squeezed there are signs that this should ease in the coming months \u2013 while unemployment fell by 3000 to 1.44 million (the unemployment rate didn\u2019t actually change, remaining steady at 4.3%). NF Back with the UK data. From Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon: Earlier, as well as the preliminary PMIs for France and Germany, there were also estimates for the eurozone as a whole. This showed the same pattern, with manufacturing slipping back in January and services rising. The eurozone manufacturing PMI dipped from 60.6 to 59.8 while services climbed from 56.6 to 57.6. The composite index rose from 58.1 to 58.6. Unicredit Bank economist Edoardo Campanella said: The eurozone starts 2018 with a bang, continuing to churn out solid economic figures. January\u2019s Composite PMI hit a near 12-year high, rising to 58.6 from 58.1 and pointing to annualized GDP growth of almost 4%. Economic activity further accelerated in the services sector to the fastest pace since August 2007, while it slowed down in the manufacturing industry \u2013 after having recorded an all-time high last December. NF The UK jobs data today shows the difficulties employers are having filling vacancies, especially those companies which use a large number of EU migrant workers, says theNational Institute of Economic and Social Research. Associate research director Dr Heather Rolfe said: UK labour market statistics released today show employment in the 3 months up to November 2017 is at a record high, driven by an increase in full time employment. However, vacancies are also at an all-time high, revealing difficulties for employers in some economic sectors, including those with a high proportion of migrant employees facing the challenges of Brexit. This reflects what employers who have engaged in our Brexit research say they are experiencing on the ground \u2013 that they are losing some EU migrants and finding it more difficult to recruit both British and EU workers. The sectors with high vacancy rates include those with relatively high proportions of migrant employees, including from the EU. Accommodation and food services, where one in six workers are EU migrants is one such sector. The challenges of attracting and retaining workers are likely to increase with prolonged uncertainty about the terms of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. NF Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Sterling breached $1.41 to record another post-Brexit high as a renewed bout of dollar softness and some better-than-expected employment numbers fuelled bids. Strong employment numbers were just the nudge the pound needed to get over $1.41, where it is just about holding at present. After showing signs of a slowdown, there was a strong bounce back in employment in December. Wage growth ex-bonuses rose by 2.4% compared to 2.3% in the quarter to October. Although below inflation at the present there are signs that tentatively rising wage growth will converge with falling inflation in the coming months. Sterling\u2019s recovery will only aid that process and is a reason to be more bullish on the UK economy and sterling. Generally speaking we are also seeing less chance of the cliff-edge exit with the tone of Brexit negotiations more constructive since December following the UK\u2019s agreement to financial terms. But for all the chatter about Brexit and UK unemployment numbers, this is very much a soft dollar story. The dollar index has given up the 90 handle and we have the dollar below 110 against the yen for the first time since September and the euro has broken to a fresh three-year high. The pound is now well bid above its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages and with today\u2019s blast above $1.41 seems set to consolidate above $1.40. There is not a huge amount of resistance on the upside for cable. The 50% retracement of the move from $1.71 to $1.19 is at $1.4590. Then we have the $1.4770 May 3rd 2016 high before the all-important $1.5000 level comes back into play. But these seem a long way off and depend entirely on dollar weakness to be sustained. For that we will look to Davos and what president Trump says with regards to trade. Concerns about trade wars \u2013 put on the back burner last year as the administration battled with Obamacare and tax reform \u2013 have resurfaced. Tariffs on washing machines and solar cells may only be the start, while there are ongoing worries about Nafta. Trade concerns are trumping the Trump tax policy as far as the dollar is concerned. And the focus on the dollar\u2019s slide seems to be dampening the mood generally in equity markets. Nevertheless, dollar softness may well be overdone and shorts could be squeezed when GDP figures for the fourth quarter are released, which are likely to confirm yet more acceleration in growth in the US and could see markets bet on a faster pace of tightening by the Fed than currently priced in. NF Real wages are still being squeezed in the UK according to the latest data, with pay growth including bonuses steady at 2.5% and despite an increase from 2.3% to 2.4% when bonuses are excluded. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: With pay growing at 2.5% [including bonuses] and inflation running at 3.0%, the squeeze on real wages continues for the ninth consecutive month. But with inflation seemingly set to fall back towards the 2% target, this looks like it\u2019ll come to an end in the next few months. We should remember, however, that the only true driver of real pay growth and rising living standards is productivity growth. This is something the UK has struggled with since the financial crisis, and as yet nobody seems to have solved the puzzle. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: While it is encouraging that regular earnings growth picked up slightly, subdued economic conditions are likely to weigh on wage growth over the next year. As a consequence, pay growth is likely to remain stubbornly below price growth over the near term, dampening consumer spending, a key driver of UK GDP growth. NF The president of Brazil, Michael Temer, is speaking now -- encouraging business leaders to provide fresh investment. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The relentless rise in sterling, which has seen it jump over 3% in the last 10 days is looking durable. The good news for the economy is that more people are working with rising wages despite any uncertainty associated with leaving the European Union. Lord Jim O\u2019Neil looks vindicated so far in his belief that strong domestic and global growth will overcome Brexit headwinds. Matthew Brittain, investment analyst at wealth manager Sanlam UK, said: The real worry [for the UK economy] is centred around the consumer where wages have been increasing at a lower rate than inflation (ie falling in \u201creal\u201d terms). So another bright spot in this release is that weekly earnings ticked up from 2.3 to 2.4% versus a year ago, which is still lower than inflation (3%) but at least the gap is steadily being closed Since the data makes it slightly more likely that the Bank of England will increase interest rates later on in the year the immediate reaction is a rise in sterling to \u00a31.41 with bonds and equities both under a little pressure. NF Sterling has climbed above $1.41 against the dollar after the better than expected UK unemployment and wages data. It is up 0.7%, a new peak since the Brexit vote but still below the $1.4878 level on the day of the referendum itself. Against the euro sterling is up 0.3% at \u20ac1.1416. The pound is benefitting from the signs of a stronger economy, and growing hopes that a Brexit deal can be reached. It is also being helped by the weakness of the dollar, which has fallen even more after the comments from US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin at Davos. The US currency has been under pressure since the tax cuts announcement, with fears the reforms would push the country\u2019s huge deficit even higher. News of trade sanctions against South Korea and China have not helped, prompting fears of retaliation. Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com, said: Sterling has bounced back in fine style, particularly against the dollar where it has climbed above $1.40 for the first time since the historic Brexit vote. Unemployment continues to fall, while there are signs that wages are finally growing, with employees willing to take more risks to ask for a pay rise, or even consider moving jobs. Although nothing has been decided yet, the general consensus is that the final version of Brexit could be softer than previously thought, which can only be good for the UK economy as a whole. NF Here\u2019s more details from former UK PM Tony Blair at Davos (speaking on Bloomberg TV) Asked whether there was any other way to avoid Brexit apart from having a second referendum, Blair said: \u201cYou could have a general election. \u201cIf we do go through with Brexit - and I hope we don\u2019t - it\u2019s going to be a complete change and we will have to fashion a new future for the country.\u201d He said that when people have clarity on what the Brexit deal might look like - and he suspects it will be \u201chotch potch\u201d - \u201cI think it will be very difficult to persuade people that\u2019s better than what we have now.\u201d Q: What is he expecting from Trump\u2019s speech on Friday? \u201cI don\u2019t know what to expect. For me the issue is not responding to what Donald Trump has just said, it\u2019s the reasons that brought him to power ... the cultural and economic alienation ... this is the root of the problem that needs to be addressed.\u201d UK employment rose unexpectedly in the three months to November, while wages rose by a higher than forecast 2.4%, excluding bonuses. The number of people in work rose by 102,000 in the quarter, said the Office for National Statistics, the biggest increase since the three months to July. Analysts had expected a fall of 13,000. The unemployment rate was steady at a four decade low of 4.3%. As for wages, the 2.4% figure was up from 2.3% in the three months to October and better than the forecasts of a flat reading. With inflation slipping back from 3.1% to 3% in November, the wage gap has edged lower. Total pay growth including bonuses was steady at 2.5%, as forecast. NF While the German and French leaders are at Davos, there is some reasonable data from both countries. The latest manufacturing PMIs for the two have come in below expectations but the service sector has outperformed. For France the preliminary manufacturing PMI for January came in at 58.1, down from 58.8. The services PMI rose from 59.1 to 59.3, with the composite PMI up from 59.6 to 59.7. In Germany the manufacturing index fell from 63.3 to 61.2, the services rose from 55.8 to 57 but the composite slipped from 58.9 to 58.8 NF The US dollar is sliding like an ill-prepared delegate on the streets of Davos, thanks to Stephen Mnuchin. The Treasury secretary\u2019s comment about not being worried about the weak dollar has sparked another wave of selling, sending the greenback to a fresh three-year low. Former chancellor George Osborne says the vote for Brexit was \u201can alliance of the insulated and the insecure\u201d. In a discussion on the causes of Brexit and Donald Trump\u2019s victory Osborne said the insulated were elderly voters who owned their homes outright but were anxious about the pace of change while the insecure were \u201con the margins of employment and looking for something to address their grievances.\u201d That was a classic good-cop/bad cop performance from Stephen Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross at Davos this morning. Mnuchin tried to calm concerns ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s visit, by insisting that America First wasn\u2019t incompatible with working with other countries. But Ross was more combative, insisting that America had been treated badly by other nations in the past, and that Trump is simply levelling the score. Ross comments about \u201cUS troops coming to the ramparts\u201d, and other countries talking about free trade but actually being protectionist, are a hint about how the US will behave behind the scenes at the World Economic Forum this week. Here\u2019s some reaction: Final question -- will the US be reassuring delegates at Davos that it isn\u2019t creating a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 on tax? Stephen Mnuchin replies that he\u2019s always been clear with fellow finance ministers that this isn\u2019t America\u2019s objective. This was about creating a comparable system for US companies to compete fairly, and we see that working. Q: What retaliations do you think China might take if the US imposes new tariffs? Every time you take a trade action, there is the possibility of the other side taking a trade action in retaliation, Wilbur Ross replies. To the degree that this happens, there\u2019s also a question about what the US would do next, Ross continues. Boom! Asked about the dangers of a trade war, US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross argues that it has been underway for some time. The difference is that the US troops are now coming to the ramparts. Stephen Mnuchin denies that there\u2019s a clash between America being \u2018open for business\u2019 and President Trump\u2019s economic goals. This is about an America First agenda, but America First does mean working with the rest of the world. President Trump is looking out for US workers and US interest, just as he\u2019d expect other world leaders to do, Mnuchin adds. Q: How concerned are you about the weakness of the US dollar? The dollar is one of the most liquid markets. Where it is in the short term is not a concern at all, says Mnuchin. A weaker US dollar is good for trade, he continues. And in the long term, the strength of the US dollar is a sign of the strength of the US economy. Q: Have you any evidence that your tax reforms are boosting investment? The vote from the market is \u2018pretty positive\u2019, Mnuchin replies. We\u2019ve seen many companies come out and commit hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, he says - citing Apple as an example. We couldn\u2019t be happier. The response from US businesses has been even better than we expected. Q: How does the America First economic agenda match up to the World Economic Forum\u2019s goals? Our objective is to be here to interact with our counterparts. That\u2019s very important for the world\u2019s biggest economy, Mnuchin replies. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross weighs in too, repeating that some of America\u2019s trading partners are protectionist, even if they talk about free trade. We don\u2019t think that adhering to the rules is protectionist. We think in fact it is essential to having markets operate properly, to have people play by the rules. Q: Are you worried that China might cut its holdings of US government debt? Treasury secretary Mnuchin says that some of the reporting of this issue has been inaccurate. The market for US treasuries is \u2018deep\u2019, he adds. Q: Is there a bubble in the United States financial markets? Mnuchin says that forums like Davos are never very good at predicting markets. What we see in the US markets is a reaction to the economic changes we\u2019ve made, he suggests - but he doesn\u2019t want to comment on other markets. As we look at US economic growth against the rest of the world, US economic growth looks very good - and it\u2019s a good place to invest, he continues. Q: What do you think about Justin Trudeau\u2019s comments about NAFTA yesterday? We totally believe in full and free trade - anyone who wants to do it on a reciprocal basis are very welcome, Stephen Mnuchin replies. Q: What might you do next against China over protectionism? Wilbur Ross: There are a number of other actions pending. Reports have been drawn up for President Trump to consider (he references the aluminium market) There will be a very busy trade agenda in terms of those actions by the US, and there are the formal actions with relation to NAFTA, Ross adds. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross speaks next, and rubbishes the idea that the US tax cuts are creating a new trade barrier This is a \u201cfunny concept\u201d, Ross says: The US has been on an uncompetitive model before, but it is now on a very competitive one. Ross also touches on free trade -- and insists that any actions taken by America are in response to \u201cinappropriate behaviour\u201d by America\u2019s trading partners. Many countries are very good at the rhetoric of free trade, but actually practice protectionism. Stephen Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, has just arrived at a packed-out press briefing here at Davos. He\u2019s accompanied by Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. Mnuchin begins by saying he\u2019s thrilled to be at Davos, with the largest US delegation to WEF ever. Obviously tax reforms and tax cuts were a major part of what we achieved in Donald Trump\u2019s first year, Mnuchin says - which will bring \u201cliterally trillions of dollars\u201d back to the UK. We are committed to achieving a 3% growth target, Mnuchin continued. And that\u2019s not just good for the US, it\u2019s good for the world economy too. Mnuchin declares: We are open for business, and we look forward to being here through the week. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair is in town! He just spoke to Bloomberg TV about the need for \u201cprogressive centerism\u201d. More on that later... The boss of Lloyds of London has warned that the focus on dry economic measures such as GDP has helped to create the backlash that led to Brexit. Speaking to CNBC at the World Economic Forum, Inga Beale said policymakers need to think differently about how they measure the economy. Beale explained: I do remember, when we were going through the campaigning around Brexit, in the UK, we, as businesses, were talking about GDP. Most of the members of the public don\u2019t even know what that means, you know, they-, it doesn\u2019t relate to them. And there\u2019s a definite feeling that they\u2019re not being included, and they want to challenge the, you know, the \u2018as is\u2019, at the moment. They really want to go out and say, \u2018I\u2019m not happy with this status quo. You\u2019re not hearing me. You\u2019re not respecting me. I\u2019m not included.\u2019 And when we talk about GDP, that doesn\u2019t feel very inclusive for them. On Monday, the World Economic Forum did launch a new, more inclusive measure of economic performance that also tracked inequality and sustainability. Britain came just 21st. Sounds like Emmanuel Macron is only paying a flying visit.. Last night, around 2000 demonstrators in Zurich marched in protest at Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the World Economic Forum. Reuters reports that a small group even managed to demonstrate here in Davos: About 20 demonstrators broke through security to reach the Davos Congress Centre, holding banners and shouting \u201cWipe out WEF\u201d before they were peacefully disbanded by police. \u201cTrump is just one of the other people we disagree with. We\u2019ve been protesting every year now against the World Economic Forum and if Trump comes or not we don\u2019t care. Trump is just, maybe he\u2019s just the best symbol of this world,\u201d protester Alex Hedinger told Reuters TV in Davos. More here. Now this is interesting.... Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin is going to give a briefing at Davos in around 30 minutes. Today\u2019s meeting is billed \u201cWe are open for business\u201d - perhaps an attempt to calm worries over President Trump\u2019s America First agenda.... Good morning. The second day of the World Economic is getting underway, with a strong European flavour. German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Emmanuel Macron and Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni are all due on the Davos main stage today - a chance to set the agenda before Donald Trump\u2019s eagerly-awaited speech on Friday. But the Americans are already fighting for the spotlight. US Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin is in town, and speaking to the press this morning (we\u2019ll hopefully have more on that soon). Spain\u2019s King Filipe, and the presidents of Brazil and Zimbabwe are also making appearances. Plus, Davos delegates will be discussing economic inequality (despite the obvious irony), slavery, and the opportunity and threats posed by technology. There\u2019s even a footballer in town. Manchester United\u2019s Juan Mata will be pushing his Common Goal charitable fund, which encourages sports stars to donate some of their massive salaries to good causes. Here\u2019s some of the events we\u2019ll try to cover: 10am Davos (9am GMT): IMF chief Christine Lagarde on \u201cSolving the Economic Generation Gap\u201d 10.20am Davos (9.20am GMT): Special Address by Michel Temer, President of Brazil 11.15am Davos (10.15am GMT): Spain\u2019s King Felipe VI speaks 12.30pm Davos (11.30am GMT): Session on \u2018Stabilizing the Mediterranean\u2019 with Italian PM Paolo Gentiloni and Greece\u2019s Alexis Tsipras 2pm Davos (1pm GMT): Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa speaks 2.20pm Davos (1.20pm GMT): Special Address by Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany 3.30pm Davos (2.30pm GMT): Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai on AI and technology\u2019s impact on society 4pm Davos (3pm GMT): A session on how to end slavery 5.30pm Davos (4.30pm GMT): Special Address by Emmanuel Macron, President of France 6pm Davos (5pm GMT): Manchester United\u2019s Juan Mata talks about his Common Goal charitable work",

Otherwise there will be nationalists, extremism. </p> <p>We need to establish a new global contract, unless everyone understands they have a part to play it won\u2019t work.</p> <p>The new global contract has three duties: the right to invest, share and protect.</p> <p>[On investment} one area we are not doing enough in is education, we have 750m adults who do not have basic literacy skills, we have to invest in education, the education of girls in particular. If we don\u2019t invest there will be not equality. It is important all the countries here commit to this [investment in education globally].</p> <p>The duty to share: there is a crisis of contemporary capitalism. It has become a capitalism of superstars, spreading of value added is not equitable. We have to establish mechanisms to share value added more equitably... We also need to speak about gender equality. In France we are launching initiatives [for more visibility], I welcome the commitments from Justin Trudeau.</p> <p>If we want to share value better, we need a more co-ordinated tax approach at a global level. There should not be a race to the bottom. We need a strategy that avoids the maximisation strategies of some companies. It is a moral issue.</p> <p>We need to renounce unbridled tax optimisation. Plus how can you have a tax on digital activities. We all want these big international companies in their country, but there is an unfair model [if they pay low taxes when national companies do].</p> <p>Disruption from digital businesses will destroy millions of jobs, and if those companies do not help finance retraining of people affected, how can I explain that [to those people]</p> <p>I am in favour of IMF being given mandate to survey whole financial system, especially those areas which escape regulation. Cryptocurrencies, shadow banking etc, are not being looked at by IMF, so we have to have a discussion.</p> <p>At what point are we going to stop innovation. To say artificial intelligence, this is a red line. We need to have a framework of international co-operation to promote technology, but also to decide principles which should be decided by government not private companies.</p> <p>Finally, protection, against terrorism, and financial protection. Need government and international co-operation for this. We need to have a discussion in G20, that there must be a monitoring of all those bodies which can promote social cohesion. </p> <p>In terms of climate protection, we have committed to many things but not up to the commitments. China has done an enormous amount of work here. India is also very important.</p> <p>But we now need to follow through and respect Paris agreement. Need a floor price for CO2, if not we won\u2019t be credible.</p> <p>China\u2019s new Silk Road has to be a green road.</p> <p>I hope by 2020 we will have an environmental pact which is legally binding.</p> <p>The private sector must also live up to its commitments.</p> <p>Finally it is the financial system which has to accompany this with green financing.

We need less arms and more brains. People have to be trained in an efficient way. We began to reform our education system, we need better access to university.</p> <p>We invest 5% of GDP in education, we will reform apprenticeships. We will invest \u20ac15bn in education and retraining over five years.</p> <p>We will make innovation the centrepiece of the economy. Reform fiscal mechanisms, create a new \u20ac10bn fund for disruptive technologies.</p> <p>The second pillar of this reform is investment and capital. We need more equity to finance risk and big innovations. We passed reforms to reallocate our savings in this direction. By decreasing corporate taxes, big reform on capital gain.</p> <p>We have reinforced France\u2019s attractiveness.</p> <p>The third pillar is acceleration and flexibility. You need more flexible structures and rules to help different companies to change business model and readapt.</p> <p>The idea is to realign France on Germany and northern Europe. Rules much more adapted to business environment, that is a big change and it makes us much more competitive.</p> <p>Fourth pillar - make France a model in fight against climate change. That is a huge advantage in terms of attractiveness and competitiveness. Talent will come where it is good to live. We can create a lot of jobs with such a strategy. We passed reforms for this green strategy. Close coal fired power stations by 2021 (Applause).</p> <p>Fifth pillar of domestic strategy is cultural change. A preference for red tape cuts and cutting complexities. We simplify and streamline processes, and simplify bureaucracy. During last six months we reduced like crazy the number of regulations.</p> <p>We have to guarantee stability for people. We passed all these measures, voted these five year strategy on taxes. Visibility is the strategy and will not change, that is my commitment.</p> <p>It is also about risk. In France it was forbidden to fail, and forbidden to succeed. Now it should be more easy to fail, take risk, but allow people to come back and try something else. When you take risk, you need reward, and you need to reduce the cost of failure.</p> <p>France is a nation of entrepreneures, ao it was a mistake in France\u2019s history.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a68b72de4b0473d0bc0fb0a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T16:48:48.361Z\">4.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We have taken action but let us not be naive.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound went on a tear this Wednesday, rocketing higher against the euro and dollar to mark the currency\u2019s best session for more than a month.</p> <p>Cable shot up a remarkable 1.6% as the day progressed, clearing not only $1.41 but $1.42 in one fell swoop. Though the UK jobs report was decent, the highlight being another minor fall in unemployment, the thrust of cable\u2019s growth is coming from the dollar\u2019s bruised and battered start to 2018.</p> <p>Despite ostensibly having the end of the US government shutdown to cheer about the dollar found little room for positivity this Wednesday, almost solely due to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin\u2019s appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos. At a press conference Mnuchin argued that a weaker dollar was better for the US economy for trade reasons, a comment that was tantamount to kicking an already very sickly dog.</p> <p>Combine that lack of policy support with a weaker than forecast US flash services PMI and a disappointing existing home sales number and the greenback gave up the ghost as the bell rang on Wall Street, plunging to a variety of fresh lows as it matched its sharp decline against the pound with a 0.8% drop against the dollar and a 1% slide against the yen.</p> <p>Of course these currency movements had major ramifications for the global indices. The Dow Jones was overjoyed at the dollar\u2019s latest defeat, jumping 160 points to soar to a brand spanking new record peak of 26375. The European markets, on the other hand, shrank in the face of the pound and the euro.</p> <p>With sterling not only destroying the dollar but rising 0.8% against the euro the FTSE took the brunt of the blows, falling to a 3 week low after dropping 0.7%.

The November figure was revised down from 5.81m to 5.7m units. The December fall came after three months of gains, and the National Association of Realtors attributed the decline to a shortage of houses at the lower end of the market.</p> <p>But for the year as a whole, sales rose 1.1% making it the best performance in eleven years. NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Existing sales concluded the year on a softer note, but they were guided higher these last 12 months by a multi-year streak of exceptional job growth, which ignited buyer demand. At the same time, market conditions were far from perfect. New listings struggled to keep up with what was sold very quickly, and buying became less affordable in a large swath of the country.

Apart from the weak dollar, one of the reasons for the pound\u2019s strength at the moment is the prospect of further UK interest rate rises, hence a 0.7% gain against the euro to \u20ac1.1464. The stronger than expected employment and wage growth numbers only add to that expectation.</p> <p>Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While the Bank of England had initially responded to the risks to demand from the Brexit vote by easing its policy in August 2016, it became increasingly data dependent over the course of 2017, eventually hiking its main policy rate by 25bp in November \u2013 the first hike in a decade.</p> <p>This came as a bit of a surprise for markets that seemed to be focusing more on downside risks to demand from Brexit than the signs of growing underlying inflationary pressure.</p> <p>According to market pricing, the BoE is set to hike the bank rate once again towards the end of the year. In our view, this seems still seems inconsistent with the BoE\u2019s data dependant approach and outlook for GDP and wage growth. Economic growth is likely to remain robust, partly helped by the strong global backdrop. Meanwhile, the BoE expects the unemployment rate to remain below its estimate of full employment (4.5% unemployment) throughout its forecast.

The sectors with high vacancy rates include those with relatively high proportions of migrant employees, including from the EU.

Strong employment numbers were just the nudge the pound needed to get over $1.41, where it is just about holding at present.</p> <p>After showing signs of a slowdown, there was a strong bounce back in employment in December. Wage growth ex-bonuses rose by 2.4% compared to 2.3% in the quarter to October. Although below inflation at the present there are signs that tentatively rising wage growth will converge with falling inflation in the coming months. Sterling\u2019s recovery will only aid that process and is a reason to be more bullish on the UK economy and sterling. Generally speaking we are also seeing less chance of the cliff-edge exit with the tone of Brexit negotiations more constructive since December following the UK\u2019s agreement to financial terms.</p> <p>But for all the chatter about Brexit and UK unemployment numbers, this is very much a soft dollar story. The dollar index has given up the 90 handle and we have the dollar below 110 against the yen for the first time since September and the euro has broken to a fresh three-year high.</p> <p>The pound is now well bid above its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages and with today\u2019s blast above $1.41 seems set to consolidate above $1.40. There is not a huge amount of resistance on the upside for cable. The 50% retracement of the move from $1.71 to $1.19 is at $1.4590. Then we have the $1.4770 May 3rd 2016 high before the all-important $1.5000 level comes back into play. But these seem a long way off and depend entirely on dollar weakness to be sustained.</p> <p>For that we will look to Davos and what president Trump says with regards to trade. Concerns about trade wars \u2013 put on the back burner last year as the administration battled with Obamacare and tax reform \u2013 have resurfaced. Tariffs on washing machines and solar cells may only be the start, while there are ongoing worries about Nafta. Trade concerns are trumping the Trump tax policy as far as the dollar is concerned. And the focus on the dollar\u2019s slide seems to be dampening the mood generally in equity markets.</p> <p>Nevertheless, dollar softness may well be overdone and shorts could be squeezed when GDP figures for the fourth quarter are released, which are likely to confirm yet more acceleration in growth in the US and could see markets bet on a faster pace of tightening by the Fed than currently priced in.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>NF</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T10:49:29.092Z\">at 10.49am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a685ea7e4b04cea3dc7a9f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-24T10:30:30.358Z\">10.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Real wages are still being squeezed in the UK according to the latest data, with pay growth including bonuses steady at 2.5% and despite an increase from 2.3% to 2.4% when bonuses are excluded.

But with inflation seemingly set to fall back towards the 2% target, this looks like it\u2019ll come to an end in the next few months.

      "bodyText": "Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee from October 2006 to May 2011 We are starting 2018 with a very upbeat outlook for the world economy. Taking all the key indicators of the health of the global economy together \u2013 growth, unemployment and inflation \u2013 we arein the most positive period of economic performance for the world economy since the financial crisis. Global growth this year should be close to 4%, and the average unemployment rate for the G7 economies is at its lowest level since the 1970s. Inflation is starting to pick up in a number of countries, with upward pressure on global food and energy prices. However, inflation still remains relatively low in most major economies around the world. This positive global picture is supporting the growth of sectors of the UK economy that trade internationally, including manufacturing. The volume of UK exports of goods, excluding oil and gold, is up nearly 10% on a year ago. Strong export performance is providing support to the growth of the UK economy while domestic demand remains relatively weak. Brexit uncertainty is holding back business investment while the squeeze on consumer spending from inflation continues. Retail sales volumes in the final quarter of 2017 were just 1% up on a year ago, the weakest growth recorded since 2013. This consumer squeeze should ease gradually over the course of this year but it is likely to continue to hold back UK economic growth during 2018. The latest data shows that wage increases continue to run below the rate of price inflation, even though it fell back slightly in December. PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 latest estimate is that UK GDP grew by 0.4% in the final quarter of 2017, which would produce an annual growth rate of 1.4% over the past four quarters \u2013 the lowest growth recorded since 2012 when we were in the depths of the euro crisis. While most other major economies have been speeding up over the past year, the UK\u2019s has slowed down. And despite the strength of the global economy, another year of disappointing growth is in prospect for 2018. David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from June 2006 to May 2009 The background to the UK economy\u2019s performance at the start of 2018 is that the stimulus being provided by the European Central Bank has meant the eurozone economy is humming along. Growth in the eurozone is helping to pull along the UK economy, which is growing at a much slower pace. The Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI rose to 54.2 in December from 53.8 in November. Alongside solid readings from the smaller manufacturing and construction, this suggests economic growth of between 0.4% and 0.5% in the final quarter of 2017. This though looks likely to still be a lot slower than most other EU countries. In the third quarter of 2017 the UK with growth of 0.4%, versus 0.6% for the EU as a whole, grew faster than only Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Lithuania and Denmark. It seems unlikely the UK will rise up the EU growth rankings in the fourth quarter, but hope springs eternal. This month the story is of a struggling consumer. Even though inflation this month fell back to 3%, it is still more than double the 1.4% in the eurozone. The IHS Markit Household Finance Index found British households reported the sharpest deterioration in financial wellbeing, while inflation expectations reached the highest levels for almost four years. That isn\u2019t surprising given the fact that nominal earnings growth in November 2017 was only 2.3%, down from 2.4% a month earlier. This means real earnings fell for the eighth month in a row. Real earnings are still 3% below their levels at the start of the great recession in 2008.",

Growth in the eurozone is helping to pull along the UK economy, which is growing at a much slower pace. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/24/consumers-are-being-squeezed-two-views-from-monetary-policy-committee-insiders\">Consumers are being squeezed \u2013 two views from monetary policy committee insiders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI rose to 54.2 in December from 53.8 in November.

This though looks likely to still be a lot slower than most other EU countries. In the third quarter of 2017 the UK with growth of 0.4%, versus 0.6% for the EU as a whole, grew faster than only Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Lithuania and Denmark. It seems unlikely the UK will rise up the EU growth rankings in the fourth quarter, but hope springs eternal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>This month the story is of a struggling consumer. Even though inflation this month fell back to 3%, it is still more than double the 1.4% in the eurozone. The IHS Markit Household Finance Index found British households reported the sharpest deterioration in financial wellbeing, while inflation expectations reached the highest levels for almost four years. That isn\u2019t surprising given the fact that nominal earnings growth in November 2017 was only 2.3%, down from 2.4% a month earlier. This means real earnings fell for the eighth month in a row. Real earnings are still 3% below their levels at the start of the great recession in 2008.<br></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Germany\u2019s chancellor Angela Merkel has sent out a strong warning to Donald Trump about the dangers of protectionism as the United States said it was preparing to impose fresh sanctions on imports from China. Merkel used a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos to stress the need for multilateral answers to global problems on a day when Trump\u2019s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, prompted fears of a tit-for-tat trade war between Washington and Beijing. With Trump due to make his own speech to the forum on Friday, Merkel said: \u201cProtectionism is not the proper answer. If we are of the opinion that things are simply not fair, then we have to seek multilateral answers, and not pursue a unilateral protectionist course where we isolate ourselves.\u201d Earlier this week the US put hefty tariffs on Chinese solar panels and washing machines, but Ross said more sanctions were in the pipeline. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that adhering to the rules is protectionist,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think, in fact, it is essential to having markets operate properly to have people play by the rules.\u201d Ross said his country had been badly treated by the protectionist policies of other countries in the past, adding: \u201cThe difference is that the US troops are now coming to the ramparts.\u201d Ross served notice that the US was looking at the aluminium market, saying: \u201cYou are aware of the actions taken yesterday. You are aware of the some of the actions that have preceded it. There will be more to come.\u201d He said he was not concerned about the possibility Beijing might respond. \u201cEvery time you take a trade action, there is the possibility of the other side taking a trade action in retaliation,\u201d he said, noting that a tit-for-tat from Beijing might lead to a ratcheting up of the US response. Ross\u2019s comments in Davos came amid speculation that the US would pull out of its free trade deal with Mexico and Canada, the North American Free Trade Agreement, unless it secures better terms. The head of the World Trade Organisation played down talk of a global trade war after the US said it was planning to take fresh action against Chinese imports. Speaking to the Guardian, Roberto Azev\u00eado said countries were becoming more aware of the risks of a go-it-alone approach that would harm their poorest citizens the most. The WTO\u2019s director general said that a year ago the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting had been dominated by talk of Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist policies leading to a trade war. \u201cWe are here one year later without a trade war and I don\u2019t think we have the makings of one yet,\u201d Azev\u00eado added. Azev\u00eado said that since 2008, only 5% of global trade had been affected by restrictive measures: \u201cWe didn\u2019t see rampant protectionist pressures.\u201d Azev\u00eado said he expected the US president to maintain his tough approach to trade in his speech on Friday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect him to change what he has been saying. He has had a very consistent approach towards international trade. He thinks the multilateral trading system has to be more responsive to economic reality and he would like to see reform.\u201d Azev\u00eado said every multilateral organisation, including the WTO, could be improved but echoed Merkel in warning against an isolationist approach, which he said would hurt poor people most. He also said it would take time to untangle the UK from trade agreements the European Union has with other countries, especially the quotas governing imports into the single market. The EU and UK want the quotas to be divided up after Brexit, but so far this has been resisted by other WTO members. Azev\u00eado said he did not expect the status quo to be agreed without scrutiny, and predicted the process could take some time. \u201cEvery time they see the opportunity to negotiate, there is a tendency for negotiators to try to maximise the outcome. After the UK leaves the EU there will be new terms of contract. Other WTO members will say whether they accept them or not.\u201d Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Sterling hits highest level since Brexit referendum The pound has had its best month since the EU referendum, rising almost 6% against the dollar to above $1.40, its highest level since the Brexit vote, after the better than expected employment figures on Wednesday. Much of the gains across the last month stem from the weak dollar, although City traders have also been betting the UK can achieve better Brexit terms than initially feared, admittedly without much hard evidence for this view. The pound has not done as well against the euro, edging up across the past month to hit nearly \u20ac1.15 on Wednesday. Sterling remains more than 5% down against the dollar compared to its June 2016 level. FTSE 100 hits record highs Global equity markets continued their pre-Christmas surge into the start of the new year, amid swelling investor confidence over the upswing in the global economy and the prospect of bumper corporate profits from Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts. I was the same for the FTSE 100, which hit a record high of 7,778.64 on 12 January, a gain for the month of about 2.5%. The second-tier FTSE 250 list, which has more companies rooted in the UK economy, rose by about 1.5%. Meets forecast Inflation eases for first time in six months There were signs of the biggest squeeze on household budgets in five years, sparked by the fall in sterling after the Brexit vote, beginning to fade last month, as the affect of the sudden drop in the pound begins to wash its way through the system. The consumer price index (CPI) fell to 3% in December from 3.1% in November, helped by lower airfare costs and a fall in the price of games and toys. Economists think the rate of growth in prices will moderate further throughout 2018. The rate of inflation was still at its highest level since April 2012. Worse than forecast Monthly trade deficit widens despite positive broader trend Britain continues to import more than it exports despite hopes that the weakness in sterling would help to increase exports. The total trade in goods and services deficit widened by \u00a3500m to \u00a32.8bn in November over the previous month, driven wider by an increase in fuel imports from non-EU countries. In the three-month period to November, the trade deficit for goods and services narrowed by \u00a32.1bn to \u00a36.2bn, as manufacturers exported more machinery and transport equipment. Better than forecast Key industries give positive signals for economic growth Britain\u2019s dominant services industry grew at a faster rate than expected last month, setting the economy on course for its strongest quarter in 2017. The Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI rose to 54.2 in December from 53.8 in November, with a figure above 50 indicating growth. Alongside solid readings from the smaller manufacturing and construction sectors, the services survey suggested economic growth of between 0.4% and 0.5% in the final three months of 2017, as UK firms benefit from a continued global upswing in economic activity.. Better than forecast Public sector finances give Hammond a boost Britain\u2019s budget deficit came in better than expected last month, handing a boost to chancellor Philip Hammond. Public sector net borrowing, excluding nationalised banks, fell by \u00a32.5bn to stand at \u00a32.6bn in December. For the first nine months of the 2017 financial year, the deficit has fallen by \u00a36bn compared with the same period last year to \u00a350bn \u2013 the lowest figure at this stage of the financial year since 2007. Better than forecast Signals of pay growth for British workers Average weekly earnings excluding bonuses increased by 2.4% in the three months to November \u2013 the biggest increase in almost a year \u2013 amid record low levels of unemployment. Despite the increase, the rise still fails to match the rate of inflation, but is a promising sign for workers as the rate of growth in prices moderates. The number of people in work in Britain hit its highest level since comparable records began in the 1970s, with the employment rate rising to 75.3%. Worse than forecast Black Friday dents Christmas sales Consumers sharply reined in spending over the Christmas period, as Black Friday deals encouraged them to purchase presents earlier, causing havoc for retailers on the high street. Spending fell 1.5% in December from November, which had been a bumper month for retail sales. The economy will suffer as a result of the slower sales, which come as consumers curb their spending due to inflation pushing up shop prices. A string of retailers have issued profit warnings in recent weeks, including Debenhams and Carpetright. Better than forecast Hammond fails to entice first-time buyers The number of inquiries from first-time buyers fell in December \u2013 even after Philip Hammond\u2019s abolition of stamp duty for the majority of first-time buyers announced in the budget a month earlier \u2013 according to property professionals. The latest monthly snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) showed 86% of industry experts in the survey had seen no response from first-time buyers last month. The survey found national house prices had edged higher, even as agreed sales slipped. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month \u2026 households are falling further into the red Official figures published last week suggested the vice-like grip on household budgets from weak wage growth and rising inflation since the Brexit vote could be combining to push more people into debt. Household spending rose at a faster pace than the increase in disposable income over the year to March, which experts said could have been fuelled by families borrowing on credit cards or bank loans. A separate IFS/Joseph Rowntree Foundation survey showed one in four of Britain\u2019s poorest households are falling behind with debt payments or spending more than a quarter of their monthly income on repayments. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The pressure on employers to find skilled staff appeared to push up wages by more than expected in November as UK job vacancies reached a new peak. City economists had expected the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit talks to limit wage rises, excluding bonuses, to 2.3%, the same rate as in October, but they increased to 2.4% in the three months to November. The figure rose to 2.5% when bonuses were included. Vacancies hit the highest level since comparable records began in 2001, up 60,000 on a year earlier at 810,000. Further indications that the labour market remained in rude health could be found in figures for the total number of people in employment, which hit 32.2 million, the highest on record. The Office for National Statistics also said the employment rate, which measures the proportion of 16- to 64-year-olds in work, reached 75.3%, a figure that was higher than for a year earlier and the joint highest since comparable records began in 1971. On Friday the ONS will publish its first estimate of GDP growth covering the last three months of 2017 and it is likely to show that the buoyant jobs market has helped the UK achieve at least 0.4% growth. Some economists said the Bank of England could react to the expectation that wages growth would jump to between 3% and 4% in 2019 by increasing interest rates several times this year. But pay growth continued to lag behind November\u2019s inflation rate of 3.1%, indicating that Britain\u2019s workforce still lacks the bargaining power to prevent living standards slipping. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the figures showed the UK labour market displayed signs of strength late last year, with employment rising and pay growth \u201ccreeping higher\u201d. He said: \u201cThe data corroborates business survey evidence which indicated that the economy maintained a solid pace of expansion towards the end of 2017. Pay growth nevertheless continues to run below inflation, squeezing consumer spending power and dampening households\u2019 views on their financial wellbeing in January. Under such conditions, it seems likely that the recent disappointing consumer spending trend will persist into 2018, restraining economic growth.\u201d Debbie Abrahams, Labour\u2019s shadow work and pensions secretary, said that despite the small increase in wage growth millions of people remain trapped in low pay and insecure work \u201cwhile the cost of basic essentials soars\u201d. She said: \u201cThese figures mask both regional inequalities and the employment gap faced by women, disabled people and BAME groups, who have too often borne the brunt of austerity cuts.\u201d A measure of wages that uses one month\u2019s figures, and not the three-month rolling measure preferred by the ONS, shows that the growth in total wages including bonuses declined in November and October compared with September. The month-on-month figures are notoriously volatile, but they indicate that despite rising vacancy rates, employers are not using higher wages as a recruitment tool. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cThe government must raise the minimum wage to \u00a310 as quickly as possible. And hardworking teachers, midwives and other public servants must get a proper pay rise after years of artificial pay restrictions.\u201d Most of the increase in employment came from a rise in full-time employment at the expense of self-employment. The ONS said 2017 marked a turning point in self-employment, which had risen every year since 2000, as employers sought to put workers on full-time contracts. Self-employment fell slightly to 4.77 million. However, the rise in job recruitment since the summer has not been fuelled by the private sector. In the period from June to September, much of the rise in employment came from a increase in hiring by the public sector and in particular a recruitment drive by the National Health Service.

    "webTitle": "Labor says scepticism of secret Trans-Pacific Partnership deal is justified", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Labor has called on the government to submit the revived Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement to economic analysis, saying the public has a right to know if it will actually benefit Australia. It has also rejected attempts by the Coalition to paint it as anti-trade, saying it will always support \u201cgood quality\u201d trade agreements that create jobs but it retains the right to be sceptical of deals done in secret. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, on Wednesday lauded the resuscitation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which had been on life support since Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal of the US from the deal a year ago. He said 11 countries \u2013 Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam \u2013 had reached agreement on a revised version of the agreement at an officials-level meeting in Tokyo on Tuesday night. The Australian reported that Turnbull will meet Donald Trump on 23 February on a trip to the US with state premiers, but on Wednesday the prime minister said he did not see any prospect of the US rejoining the TPP under Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognise that President Trump made a very straightforward, a very committed election promise not to proceed with the TPP,\u201d Turnbull said. The trade deal has been renamed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), to account for the United States\u2019 exclusion. The agreement will be signed in March in Chile. \u201cThis is a multi-billion-dollar win for Australian jobs. Australian workers, businesses, farmers and consumers will benefit,\u201d Turnbull said in a joint statement with the trade minister, Steve Ciobo. \u201cLabor and Bill Shorten declared this trade agreement dead \u2013 they urged the government to walk away. If Labor got their way, Bill Shorten would have shut Australia out of this historic agreement and denied our farmers, manufacturers, services providers and consumers the big wins the TPP delivers. \u201cThe government will never give up on measures that create jobs for Australians,\u201d they said. But the shadow trade minister, Jason Clare, said the government needed to submit the revised deal to economic modelling. He said the deal was radically different without the United States\u2019 involvement and voters ought to be told how it will affect Australia\u2019s farmers and manufacturers. \u201cThe original TTP was made up of countries that represented 40% of the world economy,\u201d Clare said. \u201cThis represents about 13% of the world economy. It\u2019s also struck out or suspended about 20 different clauses, so it\u2019s a different agreement. \u201cI have said in the past that an agreement like this has merit. It will provide modest economic benefits for the economy, that\u2019s what the World Bank said about the original agreement. \u201c[But] we don\u2019t have the same sort of World Bank analysis of this agreement as we had with the last one.\u201d The government had refused to submit the original TPP to economic modelling, saying the World Bank had already done so. The World Bank analysis showed Australia\u2019s economy would grow by less than 1% as a result of the deal. The analysis found by 2030, Australia\u2019s gross domestic product could increase by just 0.7% as a result of the agreement. By contrast, Vietnam\u2019s GDP could rise by 10% and Malaysia\u2019s by 8%. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said Labor was stalling and modelling was not needed to prove \u201ceconomic common sense\u201d. \u201cLabor would think you\u2019d need economic modelling to decide whether you put your pants on one leg at a time,\u201d he told Sky News on Thursday. But James Pearson, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, said the trade deal must to be analysed properly. \u201cIt\u2019s also important that the government does something that the parliament has recommended and that is subject the deal to a full and proper independent economic analysis so we can be absolutely sure about where the benefits lie,\u201d he told Sky News on Wednesday. The Labor frontbencher Richard Marles said there was a \u201clot of politics\u201d in Morrison\u2019s comment. \u201cIf you look at Labor\u2019s history and and how we go about things right now, we have always been in favour of trade liberalisation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe TPP itself really is the practical trade manifestation of APEC and the Hawke-Keating [Labor] government was absolutely instrumental in having APEC established.\u201d With Australian Associated Press",

It\u2019s also struck out or suspended about 20 different clauses, so it\u2019s a different agreement.</p> <p>\u201cI have said in the past that an agreement like this has merit.

      "bodyText": "The pound has reached its highest levels since before the Brexit vote, as a Guardian analysis of economic news over the past month shows the economy benefiting from an upswing in global growth. Sterling surged against the dollar on Wednesday, extending gains in the past month to hit more than $1.40 for the first time since the June 2016 referendum, after fresh figures showed employment hitting its highest levels since the 1970s when modern records began. After confounding doomsayers who predicted a recession would follow a leave vote in the EU referendum 18 months ago, the economy has proven resilient, helped by improving economic conditions around the world. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research expects official figures published on Friday to show the strongest rate of quarterly growth for 2017 came in the final three months of the year. But economists said the UK was lagging behind its major rivals, and could have enjoyed stronger growth without the leave vote. According to a forecast by the International Monetary Fund this week, the UK is set to grow at almost half the rate of the US in 2018 and lag behind every other G7 nation except Japan. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said economic strength around the world was supporting international trade at home, but that 2018 is set to be \u201canother year of disappointing growth\u201d. \u201cWhereas most other major economies have been speeding up over the past year, the UK economy has slowed down,\u201d he said. To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in four cases the outcome was better than expected. The latest dashboard shows sterling staged a sharp recovery against the dollar amid speculation the UK might be able to secure a favourable Brexit deal. The pound has also benefited from a weak dollar in recent weeks, as investors look beyond the US for opportunities as the world economy booms. There was good news for workers, with the rate of pay growth rising in the three months to November, while the number of people in work also increased to the highest level since records began in the 1970s. According to the Office for National Statistics, average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose by 2.4%. However, pay growth continues to lag behind the rate of inflation, which stood at 3.1% in November. At a time of booming activity around the world, figures over the past month showed UK factories grew their output for an eighth consecutive month in November, a feat last seen in May 1994, helped by increasing exports. Export demand from Europe, the US, China and the Middle East helped UK factories to enjoy the strongest quarter of growth since June 2014 in the final three months of the year, according to the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers index. However, domestic demand remains relatively weak, as households come under pressure from sluggish wage growth and high levels of inflation. The economy is \u201cweak and stable\u201d, according to a key Government financial watchdog. The comments from chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), Robert Chote, appear to be a reference to prime minister Theresa May\u2019s \u201cstrong and stable\u201d general election slogan. Chote told The New Statesman that the UK economy was \u201cweak and stable, rather than strong and stable\u201d. The latest dashboard showed some positive signs, as the rate of inflation dipped last month for the first time since June, dropping to 3%, in the first signs that the effects from the fall in sterling are beginning to wash out of the system. But with wage growth still running behind inflation, households may be forced into debt to keep up with the rising cost of living. The squeeze was sharply felt on the high street last month, as consumers reined in their spending in December \u2013 leading to a flurry of profits warnings from firms such as Debenhams and Carpetright. Statisticians said Black Friday deals enticed people to pull their spending into November and warned the annual growth in retail sales for 2017 was the weakest for four years. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College and a former MPC member, said the last month showed the story of the \u201cstruggling consumer\u201d. \u201cEven though inflation this month fell back to 3% it is still more than double the 1.4% in the eurozone \u2026 Real earnings are still 3% below their levels at the start of the Great Recession in 2008,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "US chipmaker Qualcomm has been fined \u20ac997m (\u00a3872m) by EU antitrust regulators for paying Apple to use only its chips in the iPhone, locking out rivals such as Intel. The European commission launched an investigation in July 2015, covering the period from 2011 to 2016, looking at Qualcomm\u2019s dominance within the market for modems and chips required to connect handsets to 4G mobile phone networks. It issued a charge sheet five months later. \u201cQualcomm illegally shut out rivals from the market for LTE baseband chipsets for over five years, thereby cementing its market dominance,\u201d said European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager. \u201cQualcomm paid billions of US dollars to a key customer, Apple, so that it would not buy from rivals. These payments were not just reductions in price \u2013 they were made on the condition that Apple would exclusively use Qualcomm\u2019s baseband chipsets in all its iPhones and iPads.\u201d The fine represented 4.9% of Qualcomm\u2019s 2017 turnover, the commission said, less than half the maximum possible fine of 10% of the company\u2019s \u00a315.8bn annual revenue. The company said it would seek a judicial review. Qualcomm executive vice-president and general counsel Don Rosenberg said: \u201cWe are confident this agreement did not violate EU competition rules or adversely affect market competition or European consumers. \u201cWe have a strong case for judicial review and we will immediately commence that process.\u201d Separate from the EU\u2019s investigation, Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a wide-ranging legal battle over the latter\u2019s business practices. In January 2017, Apple sued Qualcomm for $1bn, arguing the company overcharged for chips and failed to pay $1bn in patent royalty rebates. Qualcomm accused Apple of infringing several patents related to prolonging smartphone battery life in July, then sued Apple in November for allegedly violating a software licence contract to the benefit of rival Intel. Apple then accused Qualcomm of patent infringement for battery-life related patents. The chip manufacturer, which also makes components used in millions of Android devices, including those from Samsung, is facing investigations in multiple countries. The US Federal Trade Commission is also investigating Qualcomm\u2019s dealings with Apple, while South Korea has investigated the company for dealings with Samsung. The EU is expected to rule in the coming months in another case involving British phone software maker Icera, which has since been bought by chipmaker Nvidia. Qualcomm is accused of selling chips at below cost to drive out Icera. The EU\u2019s fine may also make Qualcomm more vulnerable to chipmaker Broadcom\u2019s $103bn hostile takeover bid. Broadcom argues it will smooth rocky relations with customers such as Apple. Qualcomm given record \u00a3631m fine in Chinese anti-monopoly case",

A joint inquiry by the business, and the work and pensions select committees will first take evidence on 30 January from the trustees of the company\u2019s retirement scheme, which is expected to land the Pension Protection Fund with \u00a3900m of liabilities.

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Countrywide has resigned days after the listed estate agent issued its second profit warning in three months, sending shares to an all-time low. In a brief statement, the company behind high street chains including Hamptons and Taylors said Alison Platt, who joined in 2014, would be replaced by Peter Long, who will lead the company as executive chairman until a successor is appointed. \u201cThe board acknowledges the commitment Alison has given to the group and wishes her well for the future,\u201d Countrywide said. Long said he would work on returning the company to profitable growth after the company had \u201clost focus\u201d in its sales and lettings business. The changes follow a warning from the company less than a week ago that the performance of its sales and letting business in the last three months of 2017 had been disappointing, particularly in London and the south-east. Countrywide said that as a result, it expected profits to fall by 22% to \u00a365m for the 2017 financial year, down from \u00a383.5m in 2016. Shares hit a new low on Tuesday, valuing the company, which is UK\u2019s largest estate agent, at just \u00a3238m, but rose 2.4% to 102p in early trading on Wednesday after news of Platt\u2019s departure. The company said Platt would be paid a full year\u2019s pay of \u00a3675,000 in lieu of a 12-month notice period. Commenting on her departure, Platt said: \u201cSince joining in 2014 I have worked hard, within a difficult market, to structure a fragmented business into one set for success. I believe those actions will serve Countrywide well in the future. However, the time is now right for me to step aside. I look forward to seeing the business build back and return to growth.\u201d Long, who was previously Countrwide\u2019s non-executive chairman, will receive \u00a3360,000 a year for the period he is executive chairman, up from his current pay of \u00a3180,000. Paul Creffield, previously managing director of commercial development at the firm, has been appointed operations director, with responsibility for the sales and lettings division.
