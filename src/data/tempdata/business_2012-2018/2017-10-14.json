      "bodyText": "Couriers working for Hermes, which delivers for major retailers including Amazon, Asos and Next, claim they face pressure to work 20 days without a break in the run-up to Christmas. Unions say this would be illegal under the working time directive were the drivers not deemed to be self-employed. Hermes rejects the claim, insisting that the couriers can choose when they work. It says that last year \u2013 when similar concerns were raised \u2013 nearly two-thirds of its couriers chose not to work on all 20 days, proving that they could opt out. However, this year couriers have been alarmed by a letter from Conor Ormsby, the firm\u2019s head of courier services, asking them to \u201censure that a substitute or cover is available to deliver on our normal service days if you are unable to provide service\u201d during the peak period. The firm says it has 4,500 couriers who provide normal cover and has drafted in an extra 6,000 relief couriers who will be in place over the Christmas period. But many couriers are sceptical and fear they will have to work 20 days consecutively if and when cover cannot be found \u2013 or risk losing their contracts. Now, in one of the first signs of workers in the \u201cgig economy\u201d rebelling against employers\u2019 working practices, the GMB union has written a letter on their behalf telling Hermes they are not prepared to work such long schedules. The letter states: \u201cI write to confirm that I will not be working 20 days non-stop for Hermes over the upcoming peak period. Under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (HSWA), I have a personal duty to ensure that I take care of my own health and safety.\u201d Last week, a parliamentary inquiry was told that one Hermes driver had his contract cancelled after being unable to work as he was in hospital because his wife had given birth prematurely. The GMB is bringing a legal case against Hermes that will be heard next year. The union says that by classifying its couriers as self-employed, Hermes avoids giving them basic rights such as holiday pay and the national living wage. \u201cThe reality is that Hermes are more focused on their own profits than considering the health and safety of their own drivers and the general public,\u201d said Maria Ludkin, the GMB\u2019s legal director. Many of Hermes\u2019 15,000 couriers have expressed support for the company and say they enjoy working the peak delivery season because it means they earn more. However, a courier who spoke to the Observer said he expected the amount of parcels he would deliver each day in the peak period \u2013 which begins on 26 November \u2013 to double from around 100 to 200. He said some couriers might expect to do considerably more than this following the online discount days, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. \u201cWe run a six-day round, but because of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Hermes say they can\u2019t cope in their depots so they need to open on Sundays,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to use Sunday couriers, they want the everyday couriers doing it, so it means we have to work the middle Sunday. We say it\u2019s dangerous, they say \u2018get cover\u2019. Some have cover but the vast majority don\u2019t.\u201d Hermes director of legal affairs, Hugo Martin, told MPs on the House of Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committe last week that its couriers earn a minimum of \u00a38.50 an hour and an average of \u00a312.20 \u2013 or \u00a310.60 once expenses such as fuel are taken into account. However, this was disputed by the courier, who requested anonymity. \u201cI\u2019m on about \u00a36.50 an hour and last month, if you average it over the month, I\u2019ve dropped to about \u00a35.80 an hour.\u201dIn a statement, Hermes said: \u201cIt is entirely unfounded and irresponsible to suggest Hermes would require couriers to put themselves or the public at risk. No courier is expected to work longer hours, more days or handle bigger volumes \u2013 and there is absolutely no penalty for choosing not to do so.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Pensions are the tail wagging the economic dog \u2013 sometimes in the strangest ways. Take the high-profile collapse at Monarch Airlines. It\u2019s a sorry story of corporate raiders facing accusations of asset-stripping one of the country\u2019s largest holiday airline businesses and leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab. The once strong, if slightly dated, brand was taken over by private equity financiers to try to make it into another Ryanair. When that failed, it appears the owners could still walk away with a profit, following a sophisticated offloading of the debts, including the ailing pension fund \u2013 once a major creditor to the business. The fund, which is in the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), may have been left short when it first collapsed in 2014. The Labour MP Frank Field, the indomitable head of the work and pensions select committee, has called for an investigation. His judgment is finely tuned after his battle with Sir Philip Green and the businessman Dominic Chappell, who bought BHS from Green before its collapse. Years of asset-stripping had left BHS with its shelves stacked high with clothes no one wanted to wear, and ditching the pension fund was one of the main methods of saving cash from the wreckage. For its part, Monarch\u2019s owner, Greybull Capital, said it had been talking to the PPF since 2014 and had not taken out loan repayments, dividends or interest in the past three years. Furthermore, Greybull said it expected a \u00a37.5m loan note from Monarch to the PPF to be repaid in full. But the PPF is creaking under the weight of final-salary schemes that have discovered their sponsoring companies can, for whatever reason, no longer support them. Today UK final-salary pension schemes have \u00a31.6tn of liabilities and a \u00a3224bn deficit. Worryingly, the deficits of the worst-affected schemes are only getting into deeper trouble. So what could be better than to find a way to offload a debilitating pensions deficit into a fund that was set up by the government, that is ostensibly independent and funded by the remaining \u201cgood\u201d employers, but will most likely fall into the taxpayer\u2019s lap some time in the future, limiting complaints from retirees? In the world of unintended consequences, another problem is that companies freed from their pension deficit are more attractive to corporate financiers looking to merge or take over firms with their spare cash. It could be argued that one of the chief defence mechanisms against corporate raiders over the past 15 years, in the absence of any protection from government, has been the deterrent effect of pension deficits. Why would a buyer want a juicy business when to bite into its balance sheet is to hit the sour taste of its heavily indebted retirement fund? That has almost certainly been a key factor in keeping British Telecom, Unilever and Marks &amp; Spencer from being snapped up by a foreign rival. Likewise all our best engineering firms, most of them founded 50 or 60 years ago and with big fat pension deficits, have been safeguarded by their whopping pension liabilities. But this is an isolated example of the good that a pension fund does for the long-term health of the economy. For example, most strikes since the crash of 2008 have not been about the failure of employers to pay a decent wage or the shift to a casualised workforce, as exemplified by the rise of zero-hours contracts. Most have been organised by shop stewards in their 50s and an ageing, unionised workforce in an effort to save their pensions. Never mind that the entitlements awarded more than 40 or 50 years ago and gold-plated by a naive Major government in the 1995 Pensions Act are unaffordably generous. The Communication Workers Union said that its planned strike action at Royal Mail \u201cwas sparked by the company\u2019s attack on the pension rights of hard-working postmen and women\u201d before going on to say it was also about pay, working hours, job security and \u201cgrowing the service\u201d. It\u2019s easy to sympathise with Royal Mail workers when their business has been asset-stripped by the government for decades before privatisation, and managers have feathered their nests before asking the shop floor for sacrifices. But huge amounts of energy are being spent by both sides fighting over pensions when they could have been saving the postal service. The pension fund gap also provides an answer, at least in part, to the productivity puzzle and why companies have invested so little in equipment and processes since 2008. Another reason for the lack of investment is the demand from shareholders to fill their boots. And who are the shareholders? Yes, it\u2019s those deficit-riddled pension funds that have increasingly forced companies to pay monster dividends or fund huge share buybacks before they even think about funding new equipment so UK workers can compete with the best in the world. It\u2019s true that UK pension funds have in recent years diverted away from the London stock market in favour of foreign stock and bond markets. However, they remain a force, and one that promotes short-termism over long-term investment. The conclusion must be that Britain\u2019s occupational pensions should all be tipped into the PPF in exchange for some state protection from foreign takeovers. Then business leaders might usefully deploy some of their revenues for investment and not just to fill baby boomers\u2019 retirement funds.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As we enjoy an era of contactless payment, credit cards and bitcoin, Sunday appears set to signal another blow to the longevity of cash. From midnight, the round pound coin, a British institution dating back to 1983, will pass its use-by date. Is cold, hard money going the way of the chequebook and the high-street bank branch? Certainly, the old pound coin as we knew it is for the scrap heap. It will lose its legal tender status and no longer be accepted in restaurants and shops except for a few including Tesco, Aldi and Poundland, which say they will take it for a little while longer. Approximately \u00a3500m worth of the coins are believed to still be in circulation. That is a lot of loose change. But official figures show the value of hard cash in the economy is increasing at a rapid rate. Annual growth in the run-up to last Christmas was the fastest in a decade, and the total value of all banknotes and coins has now surged to almost \u00a383bn. That\u2019s more than \u00a31,200 in cash for every man, woman and child in the UK. Research shows the average person has about \u00a377 in cash in their purse, pocket and at home. However, an increasing number have much more squirrelled away safely. And most of it is in \u00a320 notes, which account for more than half of the total. But this is not a peculiar quirk of the British character. There are mountains of cash around the world \u2013 although you would struggle to see them. There were $1.5tn (\u00a31.1tn) of US dollars in circulation last year, an increase of 6% on 2015, with more than a trillion made up of $100 notes. There were \u20ac1.1tn (\u00a31tn) of euro notes in circulation in August, up by 6% on a year ago. Millions of mattresses are being stuffed with notes around the globe. Mass cash stashing might signal a widespread fear of a looming apocalypse \u2013 or, more prosaically, it could signal rampant illegality. The rapid growth in cash sloshing around the UK could be a warning sign for the economy, as banknotes can facilitate crime and tax evasion. In a nod to the doom-mongers, the Bank of England estimates some people could be hoarding money for a rainy day. Brexit could be one such downpour, according to economists at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist, suggests the growth in cash in the economy and the fall in the value of the pound since the referendum might not be coincidental. And even a decade after the financial crisis, Bank of England analysis shows some people prefer not to store money at high street banks. David Fagleman, policy and research manager at Cash Services UK, which helps to coordinate the movement of money between banks, said: \u201cWe are certainly aware that in previous times of economic uncertainty, people have gone back to cash. So it could well be something that happens again over the coming years.\u201d Growing levels of financial instability for households squeezed by state benefit cuts, sluggish wage growth and the rising cost of living could be encouraging the usage of cash too. British banks are also planning the biggest squeeze on consumer credit since late 2008, potentially exacerbating the squeeze. The statistics point to a significant section of the population for whom putting spare cash under the bed is unthinkable. Around 2.7 million people in Britain relied mainly on cash in 2016, an increase of 1.1 million in the past three years. More than 1.5 million people do not have a bank account, while the latest available figures from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation suggest 13.5 million people lived in low-income households in 2015. For these Britons, cash is not a hoardable unit of insurance but a day-to-day necessity that vanishes like water. Victoria Cleland, the Bank of England\u2019s chief cashier, whose signature adorns newly-printed banknotes, said: \u201cIt tends to be that people who are less well-off will use cash as a budgeting technique. If you were in a situation where you saw more people were struggling, you would expect to see a higher demand for cash.\u201d But back to the bigger picture. Cash usage in general is falling because of the rise in technology, such as contactless payment methods. The proportion of payments using physical currency has declined from 62% of all transactions in 2006, to about 40% last year, with a further fall to about 21% expected by 2026. Carl Packman, research manager at the poverty charity Toynbee Hall, said: \u201cIn the rush towards better digital payments it would be an error to reduce access to cash. Cash is a great leveller: regardless of age and income demographics, keeping cash is a way of taking visual control of money and avoiding unwanted situations like problem debt.\u201d Part of Threadneedle Street\u2019s reasoning for replacing the three decade-old pound coin was to counter fraud, with as many as one in 30 of the coins thought to be a fake. The new 12-sided coin, which resembles the old threepenny bit and first entered circulation in March, has high-tech features to thwart counterfeiters. Suitcases full of banknotes conjure images of organised crime for good reason. The Bank found in 2015 that at least half of all UK banknotes were either held abroad or being used for illicit purposes \u2013 from drug dealing to prostitution and dodgy business deals. The study followed earlier research which showed at least 11% of UK banknotes in general circulation are contaminated with cocaine. Peter Sands, the former boss of the Asia-focused UK bank, Standard Chartered, suggests scrapping the highest denomination notes because they are more likely to be used in crime. The European Central Bank is removing the \u20ac500 note, which is nicknamed the \u201cBin Laden\u201d due to its association with money laundering and terror financing. Wads of shredded \u20ac500 notes were discovered stuffed down the sewer system of a branch of Swiss bank UBS. The links between notes and crime are forcing central banks to raise their game. The Bank of England is fighting financial crime with polymer notes, which it expects will be harder to counterfeit. The new \u00a310, featuring a portrait of Jane Austen, was launched last month, following the introduction of the \u00a35 featuring Winston Churchill earlier this year. The Bank plans to launch a \u00a320 featuring the artist JMW Turner in 2020, while it has yet to decide whether to introduce a new \u00a350 polymer note. And if British cash is not being hidden away in houses, it is being kept away from the taxman. Paying a gardener, window cleaner or childminder in cash could be depriving the British tax system of as much as \u00a36.2bn, according to official figures on the country\u2019s \u201chidden economy\u201d \u2013 which encompasses people carrying on business without telling HM Revenue and Customs. It\u2019s the biggest behavioural aspect behind unpaid taxes, which total as much as \u00a336bn, or 6.5% of theoretical total tax liabilities. Attempts to tackle the problem elsewhere have not impressed. India scrapped some higher denomination bills overnight last year, to try to catch criminals and tax evaders off guard. The move is thought to have damaged GDP growth, while underlining how some financial practices are so hard-wired into an economy that trying to remove them immediately can cause harm. It is possible that signs of overheating in the UK economy \u2013 record low unemployment and rising inflation \u2013 could deliver the answer instead by triggering an increase in Britain\u2019s anaemic borrowing costs. The record low interest rate of 0.25% means savers are offered lousy rewards by high street banks for depositing money in accounts. The average monthly interest paid on an instant access account including bonuses was 0.14% in September. Having sounded warnings in recent months that the economy might be due a rate increase, Threadneedle Street may increase the cost of borrowing for the first time in a decade from as early as November. Cleland estimates a 1% increase in rates would reduce cash demand by 2%, with the clearest effects seen by the \u00a320 and \u00a350 notes. \u201cIf you saw a significant change, that might alter behaviour and you think about the benefits of having money under the bed rather than in the bank,\u201d she said. Alternatives to cash While cash represented 40% of all payments made in Britain last year, its usage is expected to decline to 21% of all transactions by 2026. Beyond increasing use of debit cards and contactless payments, there are plenty of other ways to pay: BITCOIN Rising from obscurity but increasingly mainstream, bitcoin is the first and the biggest \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d \u2013 a tradable asset that allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment processes to pay for goods and services. Unlike currencies controlled by governments and central banks, bitcoins are created by its network of users by \u201cmining\u201d new bitcoins. Miners use vast computing power to solve maths problems, and are given new bitcoins as a reward. Regulators and banks are growing concerned about this new money: the City watchdog has warned investors in new cryptocurrencies should be prepared to lose all their money; the boss of JP Morgan, the biggest bank in the US, say he would fire any trader working for the bank who invests in bitcoin; Vladimir Putin has also warned they need regulating. They pose huge problems for tracing transactions and collecting taxes and are regularly associated with money laundering and online crime because transactions take place anonymously. The currency is also volatile, having recently soared to more than $5,800 before dipping back to $5,600 on the same day. But it is growing in popularity. A London property company says it will take residential rents paid in bitcoin by the end of this year \u2013 and another property developer says they will accept them in payment for apartments in Dubai. ETHEREUM The second-largest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin, ethereum is also a peer-to-peer software platform used for the development of computer applications and transfer of contracts. Both bitcoin and ethereum are built using blockchain technology. This is a type of decentralised digital ledger of encoded information, which exists on a network and cannot be controlled by one of the machines plugged into it alone. DIGITAL WALLET The rise of online shopping has led to the development of digital wallets, which are online places to park money outside the traditional banking system. Paypal was an early version of this type of tool, most popularly used in conjunction with shopping on eBay. However, digital wallets can be used for spending elsewhere \u2013 online and offline. APPLE PAY AND ANDROID PAY Apple and Google both operate contactless payment systems via their smartphones. They are in effect digital wallets, allowing consumers to connect their traditional bank accounts to the payment system. While both allow consumers to make contactless payments using their mobile phones, they also enable payments online. TOTNES POUND A far more basic idea: the Devonshire town of Totnes, together with several other places in Britain such as Bristol and Brixton, has introduced local currencies. Part of the Transition Town movement, the currency is designed to keep money within the local economy for the benefit of the local community, small businesses and customers. The theory is that sterling and other major currencies can be easily withdrawn from one place and used or hoarded elsewhere, which can be potentially damaging to a local economy. Community currencies aim to foster greater links between producers and users, encouraging local development and cutting down on pollution caused by the transportation of goods from elsewhere. M-PESA Launched by Vodafone\u2019s Kenyan associate, Safaricom, in March 2007, M-Pesa is a mobile phone-based money transfer system. It is hugely successful in Kenya and growing fast in other countries \u2013 including Afghanistan, Egypt, Albania and Tanzania -where access to traditional banking services can be limited. The service, now live in 10 countries, enables users to deposit money into an account stored on a mobile phone, as well as to send money to others and make payments and withdrawals. It also cuts street crime and corruption.",
