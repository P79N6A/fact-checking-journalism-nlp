      "bodyText": "The new chief executive of Goldman Sachs, part-time DJ David Solomon, was probably hoping to give his image a more professional sheen when he stepped into the top job at the world\u2019s most famous investment bank. The institution\u2019s deepening entanglement in a major corruption scandal is certainly a serious matter that will limit his leisure time. The Wall Street giant\u2019s work for Malaysia\u2019s state investment fund \u2013 known as 1MDB \u2013 was not a secret, but a recent US Department of Justice investigation and subsequent charges against former Goldman bankers have immediately raised the pressure on Lloyd Blankfein\u2019s successor. Goldman\u2019s legal team is preparing for a meeting with the DoJ next week, as Goldman faces the prospect of reputational and financial damage from the alleged multibillion dollar fraud at 1MDB. Goldman Sachs is under fire for two issues: its work in raising funds that were later said to have been misused by conspirators and Malaysian officials; and for also charging fees of about $600m (\u00a3460m) for its efforts. The US last week unveiled charges against two former Goldman Sachs bankers for conspiring to launder billions of dollars embezzled from 1MDB. Tim Leissner, a former Goldman Sachs partner in Asia, has pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money and breach the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by bribing Malaysian and Abu Dhabi officials and sidestepping internal accounting controls. He has been ordered to hand over $43.7m as a result of those crimes. Another former Goldman banker, Roger Ng, was arrested in Malaysia on 1 November on bribery charges. Meanwhile, the lender has reportedly put its former co-head of Asia investment banking, Andrea Vella, on leave. News reports have also identified Blankfein as the executive who attended initial meetings with a key financier and middleman Jho Low \u2013 also charged by the DoJ but still at large \u2013 and the now-ousted Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak. Blankfein remains a senior figure at Goldman Sachs, having retained his position as chairman. Some $4bn eventually vanished from 1MDB, with US prosecutors claiming the diverted cash was used by conspirators to buy luxury real estate in the likes of New York, pricey artwork, and fund the production of Hollywood films including The Wolf of Wall Street. When pushed to respond to the US indictments, Solomon characterised the former Goldman bankers as rogue employees who breached the lender\u2019s standards. \u201cIt is obviously very distressing to see two former Goldman Sachs employees went so blatantly around our policies and so blatantly broke the law,\u201d Solomon told Bloomberg TV. \u201cI feel horrible about the fact that people who worked at Goldman Sachs, and it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s a partner or it\u2019s an entry level employee, would go around our policies and break the law.\u201d A Goldman Sachs representative declined to comment further but told the Guardian that \u201cthe firm continues to cooperate with all authorities investigating this matter\u201d. Goldman is now facing the prospect of sanctions by the DoJ, while Malaysian politicians look at clawing back some of the $600m fees. The bank has reportedly defended the hefty bill, citing the risks involved. It has pointed to transactions including buying unrated bonds from 1MDB in an effort to generate quick cash for the fund while it continued to search for outside investors. A hit from a prospective DoJ settlement or any move towards restitution on behalf of the Malaysian government could risk denting the bank\u2019s earnings, which have managed to beat analyst estimates so far this year. The US bank warned in its third quarter results this month that it was \u201cunable to predict the outcome\u201d of the DoJ probes. \u201cAny proceedings by the DoJ or other governmental or regulatory authorities could result in the imposition of significant fines, penalties and other sanctions against the firm,\u201d the bank said. Malaysian politician and prime minister-in-waiting, Anwar Ibrahim, said earlier this month that it would be inexcusable if Goldman was found to have been complicit to the \u201cexcesses and crime\u201d while \u201cthe country and the people suffer\u201d. That was after the country\u2019s finance minister, Lim Guan Eng, suggested in June that the country\u2019s government would also be exploring whether to seek claims from Goldman Sachs over the scandal. Any details outlining Goldman\u2019s involvement or complicity in the fraudulent behaviour would also put a black mark on its reputation just as Wall Street marks a decade on from the 2008 banking crash. Solomon will be tested by how it copes with the fallout, having been tipped to engineer a cultural shift at the bank. He has already been noted for keeping a tighter grip on Goldman\u2019s inner circle, having anointed the smallest number of new partners in decades earlier this week. But only when he puts the question of the bank\u2019s misconduct around 1MDB to rest will Solomon be able to shift focus back to his DJ decks.",

      "bodyText": "Three of Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket groups have won a legal victory worth up to \u00a3500m, following a court battle over business rates on cash machines installed at their shops. The court of appeal ruled on Friday that cash machines located both inside and outside stores should not be liable for additional business rates, which are a form of property tax on businesses collected by the government. Several retailers including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and the Co-op had fought in the courts against the tax rules set by the Valuation Office Agency \u2013 the arm of HM Revenue and Customs responsible for setting business rates \u2013 which had claimed that ATMs should be additionally assessed. The court verdict means the supermarket chains are in line for a multimillion pound windfall from tax refunds, which the property advisory company Colliers estimates is worth about \u00a3500m. The case dates back to a 2013 decision by the government to charge rates on \u201chole-in-the-wall\u201d cash machines, which was backdated to 2010. Although the refund is small compared to the \u00a31.8bn annual business rates liability for the four biggest supermarket firms \u2013 Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 it does however come at a time when high street retailers are facing growing pressure from online rivals who pay less in tax. A spokesperson for the Co-op suggested that the victory would help it keep cash machines at its stores, helping people who rely on them as high street banks shut branches up and down the country. \u201cThe case had threatened the viability of the ATM network and risked the future of much-needed banking services across communities.\u201d Banks have been heavily criticised by MPs for closing hundreds of branches in recent years, particularly in rural areas, and often leaving consumers with little option but to use supermarket cash machines or ATMs that charge a fee. Labour estimates that 60 bank branches and 250 free cash machines close every month, and has promised to ban ATM charges and block branch closures to help rejuvenate high streets. The court of appeal refused to grant the Valuation Office leave to have the case heard in the supreme court, although it can petition for an appeal. A spokesperson for the agency said: \u201cWe are considering the implications of the court of appeal decisions.\u201d",

French officials seized the aircraft on Thursday ahead of a planned flight to Stansted and forced 149 passengers to disembark. The French civil aviation authority said it was \u201cregrettable that the state was forced\u201d to seize the plane, but that it took the measure because the low-cost airline had repeatedly ignored demands to repay subsidies a regional government handed to Ryanair. The European commission ruled that about \u20ac1m of subsidies paid to Ryanair in return for it providing flights from Angoul\u00eame, 80 miles (130km) north-east of Bordeaux, to London between 2008 and 2009 were illegal. Ryanair was ordered to repay all the money, which the commission said gave the airline an unfair advantage. But the French government said Ryanair had only paid back half the money, so it seized the plane and demanded the balance. The airline paid the bill on Friday. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the state had to take such action, which led to the inevitable inconvenience of the 149 passengers onboard the immobilised plane,\u201d the French civil aviation authority said. \u201cThose passengers were able to eventually reach their destination later that evening on another Ryanair plane, but with a five-hour delay.\u201d Ryanair did not respond to requests for comment.",

      "bodyText": "And finally.... a UK thinktank has predicted that UK growth will slow to 0.4% in the final three months of 2018 The National Institute of Economic and Social Research\u2019s latest GDP tracker predicts that the UK economy expanded by 0.4% in August-October, down from the 0.6% growth racked up in the third quarter. NIESR also believes the economy will run at a similar rate until the end of 2018, and cautions not to get carried away by the stronger growth this summer. It says: In our view, UK economic growth peaked in the third quarter of this year and will settle at a rate that is close to its post-crisis average in the final quarter. According to new ONS statistics published this morning, the UK economy expanded by 0.6 per cent in the third quarter (three months to September) after growing by 0.4 per cent in the second quarter (three months to June). The outturn was slightly lower than the 0.7 per cent monthly GDP forecast that we published last month for the same period and the error is partly because of back data revisions. Building on the official data, our monthly GDP Tracker suggests that the economy will expand by 0.4 in the final quarter of this year. The apparent strength in third quarter growth masks a loss in momentum in industrial production as well as services output in the latter part of the third quarter. There are a number of factors at play, including Brexit-related uncertainty. That\u2019s a good point to wrap up for the day, and the week. Thanks for reading and commenting. We\u2019ll be back next week. GW Here\u2019s a round-up of how the UK growth figures are being reported: Reuters: UK economy grows strongly in third quarter, with hints of tougher times ahead Britain\u2019s economy kept up healthy momentum during the third quarter, but this may prove a high watermark ahead of Brexit, official figures showed on Friday. Gross domestic product in the three months to September was 0.6 percent higher than in the previous quarter, matching the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed. Compared with a year earlier, the economy stood 1.5 percent larger. But in September alone, it stagnated for a second month running, compared with forecasts for a rise of 0.1 percent. Financial Times: UK economy grows at fastest rate since 2016 The UK economy accelerated to its fastest quarterly growth rate in almost two years over the summer but economists warned that with Brexit uncertainties curbing spending, the performance would soon decline. Daily Telegraph: Strong summer sales fade as economy slows into autumn Economic growth hit its highest pace since 2016 as GDP surged 0.6pc in the third quarter of the year on stronger manufacturing and construction growth. Annual growth accelerated to 1.5pc, up from 1.2pc three months ago. But there are already signs the acceleration has faded, with most of the improvement coming in July and growth petering out by September. The Times: Sunny summer helped economy to fastest growth for two years The British economy grew by a perky 0.6 per cent in the third quarter, its fastest for two years, but the positive number was soured by a third successive quarter of falling business investment. The Office for National Statistics said that the growth in total output compared to the second quarter was the fastest performance since the first quarter of 2016, when the economy surged by 0.7 per cent. Cheerfulness fuelled by England\u2019s showing in the World Cup and the sunny weather pushed up retail sales and a recovery in construction in July produced a surge in the economy in the first month of the period. August and September were both flat, however, confirming concerns that the impetus has been fading. Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s growth figures: Andy Scott, associate director at independent financial risk management consultancy JCRA, also fears the UK is now slowing: \u201cThe latest GDP figures show that the unexpectedly hot and sunny Summer has encouraged consumers to spend more on eating and drinking out, while Sterling weakness has helped to boost trade. By contrast, investment contracted sharply, suggesting that companies are preparing for a weaker economy by scaling back on spending, with implications for GDP growth as well as the labour market. With a Brexit deal still hanging in the balance, we expect the economy to slow in the current quarter, as businesses and consumers brace themselves for the eventuality that no solution is found for the Irish border issue. The overall picture of the UK economy is however, one of resilience. With unemployment at multi-decade lows and wages accelerating, the robust levels of household spending should continue to act as a buffer against weakening sectors such as manufacturing, preventing the economy from stalling or worse, contracting. It\u2019s official: the government can organise a photo op in a brewery..... Here\u2019s the ONS\u2019s take on the growth figures: The UK can claim to have been one of the faster-growing advanced economies this summer. The eurozone, for example, only expanded by 0.2% in July-September, with Italy not managing any growth at all. Even France, which should have enjoyed its own World Cup boost, only grew by 0.4%. We get German GDP next Wednesday; some economists fear Europe\u2019s largest economy may have shrunk due to trade war tensions, and a slowdown in its car sector. Japan is also predicted to have contracted, partly due to earthquake and typhoon disruption. Britain hasn\u2019t caught up with America\u2019s strong growth, though.. Here\u2019s what we know so far: US: +0.9% quarterly growth in Q3 (or 3.5% on the \u2018annualised\u2019 basis used in America) UK: +0.6% quarterly growth France: +0.4% quarterly growth Eurozone: +0.2% Italy: Stagnation Canada: 0.2% growth in July, and 0.1% in August TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady has called on the government to help stop the \u201cworrying fall\u201d in business investment. \u201cThe government should set up a National Investment Bank to upgrade Britain\u2019s infrastructure. This would help raise productivity, giving a boost to growth and wages. Business investment would also benefit from a Brexit deal that doesn\u2019t gum up Britain\u2019s trade links with the EU.... Hammond\u2019s claim that Britain\u2019s economy has \u2018underlying strength\u2019 really doesn\u2019t match the steady slide in UK business investment this year. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, says today\u2019s growth figures show the UK economy\u2019s underlying strength. Speaking on a trip to Fuller\u2019s Brewery in London (nice work if you can get it!), the chancellor hailed the GDP report - even though several economists are warning that the economy is slowing. Hammond says: \u201cToday\u2019s positive growth of 0.6% is proof of the underlying strength in our economy. We are building an economy that works for everyone with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade. Now our focus is on locking in this progress and ensuring people\u2019s wages can continue to rise. \u201cThat is why my Budget supports hardworking families by cutting taxes for 32 million people, provides more funding for public services \u2013 including a record-breaking funding increase for our vital NHS \u2013 and invests in our future with more money for transport and digital technology.\u201d The CBI also fears that the UK economy is weakening, despite its sparkling summer. Their principal economist, Alpesh Paleja, says: \u201cThe sun shone on the UK economy over the summer, boosting economic growth relative to the second quarter. \u201cBut as the impact from the warm weather and World Cup fades, we expect subdued growth ahead. Indeed, our surveys for October already paint a picture of weaker momentum. Will Hobbs, head of investment strategy at Barclays Smart Investor, is also concerned that storm clouds are gathering over the UK economy: \u201cWe should not be lulled into a false sense of security by a third-quarter that was propped up by a bounce in consumption. Incoming private sector confidence surveys tell us very clearly that the sky is darkening a little for the UK as the realities of a hard Brexit start to weigh more visibly on short term private sector decision making. Brexit is clearly to blame for the slide in UK business investment, says analysts at Danke Bank This pick-up in UK growth won\u2019t last, according to Ana Boata, senior economist at Euler Hermes. She fears that growth could halve in the current quarter: \u201cThe rebound in UK economic growth in Q3 was triggered by a number of temporary factors including contingency planning in light of the uncertainty on the Brexit deal by March 2019. \u201cWe expect GDP growth to fall to 0.2-0.3% in Q4 as tightening financial conditions, weaker consumer confidence and more fragile business profitability take their toll on the UK economy. The drag on growth from the Brexit related uncertainty will remain and will hinder investment opportunities. Here\u2019s confirmation that the sun and the soccer helped drive the UK economy in July. Better news: Britain\u2019s exporters helped to drive growth up over the summer. The ONS says that net trade made the largest positive contribution to GDP growth in the last three months, thanks to a 2.7% rise in exports. Imports were flat. Another blow: business investment fell by 1.2% between Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 2018. This is the sharpest decline since the first quarter of 2016 and marked the third consecutive quarterly fall \u2013 which has not been seen since the global financial crisis, the ONS says. This is likely to be due to the impact of Brexit uncertainty, as firms are reluctant to commit to new factories and offices until they have more clarity. Update: here\u2019s the chart: Once again, Britain relied on consumer spending for its growth. Household spending grew by 0.5% in the last quarter, the ONS says. On an annual basis, the UK economy grew by 1.5% in July-September. That\u2019s the best result in a year. But the ONS isn\u2019t impressed, saying that the UK continued \u201cits relatively subdued performance over the last year.\u201d Oh dear. Today\u2019s GDP report also shows that the UK economy didn\u2019t post any growth in September, or in August. Economists had expected GDP to rise by 0.1% in September, so this is a blow. One month\u2019s sizzling growth (thank you July!) isn\u2019t enough. The ONS says: Real GDP growth in Quarter 3 was driven by growth of 0.3% in July 2018, which stemmed from strong retail sales boosted by warm weather and the World Cup, as well as a low base reflecting the weaker start to the year. Month-on-month growth in real GDP has been flat in both August and September 2018. Confirmation that the UK economy just racked up its best quarter since the end of 2016: All four sectors of the UK economy - services, industry, construction and agriculture - grew in the last quarter. The ONS says: All four sectors of output contributed positively to growth in Quarter 3 2018, with the largest contribution from the services industries at 0.3 percentage points. NEWSFLASH: The UK economy grew by 0.6% in the third quarter of this year. That\u2019s the fastest growth in a calendar quarter since the last three months of 2016. That\u2019s up from 0.4% in the second quarter of 2018, the Office for National Statistics says. More to follow.... Here we go... Today\u2019s growth figures could be the high point of 2018... The prospect of UK growth hitting its highest level since the end of 2016 hasn\u2019t cheered the London stock market. Shares are down across Europe this morning, as the rally following this week\u2019s US elections fizzles out. This has knocked 0.7% off the Stoxx 600, which tracks the region\u2019s largest companies. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says: \u201cJust as it looked like the US midterm election results would give a boost to markets around the world, momentum has been quickly lost. \u201cA falling oil price has troubled investors and shifted their focus back to concerns about a slowdown in global economic growth.\u201d The Treasury have tweeted a short (and simple) video clip to explain what GDP means: If today\u2019s third-quarter GDP report is indeed strong, then July can take much of the credit. A consumer spending surge helped to drive growth at the start of the last quarter, but it is likely to have faded by the end. As Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services puts it: The story for the UK economy in Q3 was a strong start which had fizzled out almost completely by the end of the quarter, indeed monthly GDP and the Index of Services for September are seen at just 0.1% m/m after flat readings in August. Q3 Business Investment is projected to rebound modestly to 0.2% q/q, which would be an improvement on Q2\u2019s -0.7% q/q, but is obviously heavily encumbered by Brexit related uncertainties Good morning. Britain\u2019s sizzling summer is, alas, behind us. The barbecues have been put away, and World Cup wall charts have been taken down, as the country braces for Storm Deirdre to give us an autumnal blast. But we\u2019ll always have the memories. And this morning, we discover just how well the economy performed in July-September - and whether Brexit uncertainty and global trade conflicts took the shine off the sizzling summer. New UK GDP data is expected to show Britain\u2019s economy expanded at its fastest rate in almost two years over the summer, with growth of around 0.6%. That would be much better than the measly 0.1% growth recorded in Q1, or the 0.4% in Q2. To be honest, it would be a surprise if today\u2019s GDP reading wasn\u2019t good. Under the UK\u2019s new monthly GDP reporting system, we already know that July was strong (with growth of 0.6% in that month alone). August seems to have been flat, but growth probably picked up a little in September. Royal Bank of Canada predict that household spending and building activity boosted growth over the summer: The good summer weather boosted consumer spending and construction activity. This first release of quarterly GDP now comes with an expenditure breakdown which we expect to show household consumption and investment being the major contributors to third quarter growth. Amid a blizzard of data at 9.30am, we\u2019ll also learn how well Britain\u2019s factories and service sector firms and exporters fared in September. But a strong performance won\u2019t fix all Britain\u2019s economic challenges. The City fears that growth is slowing in the current quarter, as firms slash investment plans ahead of Brexit. Yesterday the European Commission predicted Britain would tumble to the bottom of the European growth league next year, even after a soft departure from the EU.

      "bodyText": "No chancellor can resist the idea of a good photo opportunity and Philip Hammond chose a brewery to mark the release of Britain\u2019s latest growth figures. As he pulled a pint for the cameras, the chancellor\u2019s message was that the strongest expansion in almost two years was proof of the underlying health of the economy. It was no such thing. This was a glass mainly full of froth. On the face of it, the economy has been picking up speed throughout 2018. Growth was 0.1% in the first quarter, 0.4% in the second quarter and has now hit 0.6% in the third quarter. But what actually happened was that bad weather in the first few months of the year artificially depressed activity and this weakness has been followed by a period of catch-up, especially in the construction sector. On top of that, a combination of a summer heatwave and England\u2019s unexpected progress in the World Cup boosted retail spending in July, the first month of the third quarter. In both August and September, the economy flatlined and forward-looking surveys suggest a slowdown to 0.2-0.3% in the final three months of the year. Spending in the high street and online fell back after the summer surge, which either means that consumers are saving their money for a Christmas spree or that retailers are in for a miserable festive season. Either way, the third quarter was as good as it gets for now. Nor does the breakdown of the flash GDP estimate support Hammond\u2019s argument that the economy is in tip-top shape. Business investment fell by 1.2%, the third quarterly decline in a row. That has not happened since the financial crisis of a decade ago, with the inescapable conclusion that Brexit uncertainty is leading to firms deferring spending while the negotiations drag on. One encouraging aspect of the GDP data was that trade contributed 0.8 percentage points to growth in the third quarter. Again, though, this was slightly illusory since imports of cars were significantly depressed by EU emissions tests. While UK growth accelerated in the third quarter, growth in the eurozone went in the other direction, halving from 0.4% to 0.2%. Italy went sideways, while it looks likely that figures next week will show a small decline in German activity. The underlying picture, however, is similar. Growth in the UK has been modest for a decade despite the colossal amount of stimulus provided by the Bank of England. The same applies to the eurozone, where the impact of the European Central Bank\u2019s activity-boosting measures is now fading. It wouldn\u2019t take much \u2013 on either side of the Channel \u2013 to turn fragility into something a whole lot worse.",

As he pulled a pint for the cameras, the chancellor\u2019s message was that the strongest expansion in almost two years was proof of the underlying health of the economy. It was no such thing. This was a glass mainly full of froth.</p> <p>On the face of it, the economy has been picking up speed throughout 2018. Growth was 0.1% in the first quarter, 0.4% in the second quarter and has now hit 0.6% in the third quarter. But what actually happened was that bad weather in the first few months of the year artificially depressed activity and this weakness has been followed by a period of catch-up, especially in the construction sector.</p> <p>On top of that, a combination of a summer heatwave and England\u2019s unexpected progress in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/10/uk-economy-gets-kick-from-world-cup-heatwave\">World Cup boosted retail spending </a>in July, the first month of the third quarter. In both August and September, the economy flatlined and forward-looking surveys suggest a slowdown to 0.2-0.3% in the final three months of the year. Spending in the high street and online fell back after the summer surge, which either means that consumers are saving their money for a Christmas spree or that retailers are in for a miserable festive season. Either way, the third quarter was as good as it gets for now.</p> <p>Nor does the breakdown of the flash GDP estimate support Hammond\u2019s argument that the economy is in tip-top shape. Business investment fell by 1.2%, the third quarterly decline in a row. That has not happened since the financial crisis of a decade ago, with the inescapable conclusion that Brexit uncertainty is leading to firms deferring spending while the negotiations drag on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>One encouraging aspect of the GDP data was that trade contributed 0.8 percentage points to growth in the third quarter. Again, though, this was slightly illusory since imports of cars were significantly depressed by EU emissions tests.</p> <p>While UK growth accelerated in the third quarter, growth in the eurozone went in the other direction, halving from 0.4% to 0.2%. Italy went sideways, while it looks likely that figures next week will show a small decline in German activity.</p> <p>The underlying picture, however, is similar. Growth in the UK has been modest for a decade despite the colossal amount of stimulus provided by the Bank of England. The same applies to the eurozone, where the impact of the European Central Bank\u2019s activity-boosting measures is now fading. It wouldn\u2019t take much \u2013 on either side of the Channel \u2013 to turn fragility into something a whole lot worse.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK economy expanded at the fastest pace in two years during the third quarter, but has begun showing signs of a slowdown ahead of Brexit as more business investment decisions are put on hold. In what is likely to be a peak for the economy this year, the latest snapshot from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed GDP growth in the three months to the end of September was 0.6% \u2013 the fastest expansion since the final quarter of 2016. But growth has begun to falter as the boost to the economy from the warm weather over the summer and England\u2019s performance at the World Cup has fizzled out. GDP growth flatlined in August and September, with signs of weakness in business spending, retail sales and a fall in domestic car purchases. City economists had forecast growth of 0.1% in September, although the UK economy unexpectedly stagnated for the second month in a row, as new car registrations fell by a fifth in the worst September for the motor trade in a decade. Although there are gathering signs of weakness as the country braces for Brexit on 29 March next year, on an annual basis, the British economy grew by 1.5%. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said on a visit to the Fuller\u2019s brewery in London just two weeks after the budget that the growth rate was \u201cproof of the underlying strength in our economy\u201d. There are however mounting signs of underlying weakness as Theresa May struggles to agree a Brexit deal with the EU, and business investment dropped at the fastest rate since early 2016. The latest figures reveal a contraction in corporate spending of 1.2% during the third quarter, which was the first time business investment has slipped for three consecutive quarters since the global financial crisis a decade ago. Azad Zangana, senior European economist at the City fund manager Schroders said concerns over Brexit were among the reasons for businesses delaying investment decisions. \u201cAlthough more recently, those delays are turning into cancellations, with almost daily announcements of manufacturing jobs losses and plant closures as firms shift production out of the UK,\u201d he added. The largest contribution to growth in the third quarter came from the UK\u2019s services sector. Net trade \u2013 the difference between imports and exports \u2013 contributed 0.8 percentage points to GDP growth, with a 2.7% increase in exports versus stagnant growth in imports. Construction output continued to accelerate following a weak start to the year, when freezing weather from the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d forced cranes and diggers across Britain to fall idle. Quarterly output in manufacturing also rose for the first time in 2018. With an expansion of 0.6% in the third quarter, the latest GDP figures suggest the UK economy grew three times faster than that of the eurozone, after growth in the single currency bloc dropped to 0.2%, the lowest rate in four years. However, economists believe UK growth has likely peaked. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s economics watchdog, estimates growth will drop to 1.3% in 2018 from 1.7% last year \u2013 which would make 2018 the worst year for the economy since the recession in 2009. Rob Kent-Smith, the head of national accounts at the ONS, said: \u201cThe economy saw a strong summer, although longer term economic growth remained subdued.\u201d Economists said that much of the acceleration in growth during the third quarter would have come as companies and businesses caught up on purchases and sales they would have made earlier in the year, yet were prevented from doing so by the freezing weather during February and March. Samuel Tombs, of the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cTwo consecutive months of stagnation in GDP [during August and September] underline that the economy has little momentum and that the strong quarter-on-quarter growth rate simply reflects the weather-related rebound in the summer.\u201d Strengths and weaknesses in the UK economy Strength: consumption Helped along by warmer weather over the summer, household spending grew by a robust 0.5% in the third quarter. The services sector, the largest driver of growth in the economy, grew by 0.4%. However, consumer spending began to slow in August and September. Strength: labour market Unemployment is at the lowest levels since the mid-1970s, while average weekly earnings are growing at the fastest pace in almost a decade. Still, households have come under pressure from higher inflation, with real pay yet to return to the peak recorded before the financial crisis. Weakness: business investment Brexit-related uncertainty has put the dampeners on business investment, with a decline of 1.2% in the amount invested by companies in the third quarter. This marked the third straight quarterly decline \u2013 the first time this has happened since the global financial crisis. Weakness: car industry Production of transport equipment fell by 0.2% in the third quarter, in the first such decline since the financial crisis. Economists blamed the decline on weaker levels of car production, amid squeezed household incomes and new emissions tests.",

Up to 40 firms are taking part in the voluntary exercise, alongside the BoE, the Treasury, City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority and UK Finance, the industry trade body. It is the latest in a series of simulated attacks hosted by the BoE every couple of years in an attempt to identify any weaknesses in the response of banks and other financial institutions to a major cyber-attack. The ability of firms and organisations to communicate with each other during such an attack will also be tested. \u201cThe exercise will help authorities and firms identify improvements to our collective response arrangements, improving the resilience of the sector as a whole,\u201d the BoE said. The tests will not be carried out on a pass or fail basis but the BoE is expected to make public some of the lessons learned at a later date. Friday\u2019s test has been designed by the Bank with input from the National Cyber Security Centre, a branch of Britain\u2019s intelligence and security service, GCHQ. A number of high-profile data breaches both within and outside the financial sector in recent months have highlighted how vulnerable firms are to cyber-attacks. Earlier this year Dixons Carphone said that it had found unauthorised access to personal data belonging to up 10m customers, including their names, addresses and email addresses. The electronics retailer also identified unauthorised access to the payment cards of 5.9m customers, although the vast majority were chip and pin protected, and no pin codes, card verification values (CVV) or authentication data were accessed, meaning purchases could not be made. In the US, HSBC suffered a serious data breach in its US retail banks business, with hackers gaining access to customers\u2019 account details, statement histories and other personal information. British Airways revealed it suffered two cyber-attacks on its website in September and October.

To stop the rot Ashford borough council stepped in and bought the struggling precinct for a six-figure sum from its owner, a subsidiary of a Swiss bank that had failed to invest in it.

You have got to create a civic heartbeat, so that everybody is proud to live here.\u201d Amid growing frustration over serial government failure to develop effective policies to tackle the high street crisis, local councils are starting to become more proactive. Canterbury city council bought the Whitefriars shopping centre for \u00a375m this year, while in Shropshire the county council has spent just more than \u00a350m on three shopping centres in Shrewsbury. Retail experts say changing shopping habits such as the march of the supermarkets and growth of online shopping means fewer stores are now required. This year an independent review said struggling retailers should no longer be relied upon to prop up ailing town centres. \u201cThere is no point clinging to a sentimental vision of the past,\u201d said Bill Grimsey, the former Wickes and Iceland chief executive who co-authored the Grimsey Review 2 (revisiting a subject he first looked at in 2013). \u201cWe have to accept that there is already too much retail space in the UK. Town centres need to be repopulated as community hubs.\u201d The Grimsey Review 2 set out a blueprint for change that included setting up local town centre commissions, each tasked with drawing up a 20-year plan. The creation of a new national body \u2013 similar to the Scottish Towns Partnership \u2013 was also among the 25 recommendations in the review. Other suggestions included creating a landlord register, giving local authorities the power to fine owners whose properties are left empty for more than six months, and passing legislation enabling shops to be converted more readily into homes or community facilities such as libraries or arts venues. In last month\u2019s budget the chancellor, Philip Hammond, outlined a number of initiatives to help struggling high streets, including business rates relief for independent shopkeepers and a consultation that would seek to relax planning rules so some of Britain\u2019s 50,000 empty shops can more readily be repurposed as gyms, libraries and houses. The government also announced a \u00a3675m \u201cfuture high streets\u201d fund with councils from next year able to bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as local historic building refurbishments and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas. \u201cWe expect local areas to set out how their plans will enable their high street to adapt to changes in consumer demands and give details of individual projects with a clear economic benefit,\u201d says the policy paper outlining the fund\u2019s purpose ahead of the publication of its full prospectus. \u201cWe would not expect local areas to bid for funding to expand traditional retail on their high street.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Retailers have called for \u201cdecisive action\u201d from the government to support the UK\u2019s battered high streets after new data showed the number of shops, pubs and restaurants lying empty has soared by more than 4,400 in the first six months of this year. Closures increased by nearly 17% to 24,205 across 3,000 towns, cities, retail parks and shopping centres monitored by the Local Data Company. The number of new openings of shops, restaurants, pubs and other leisure destinations declined by 2.1% to 19,803 over the half year \u2013 leaving 4,402 more gaps on the high street. That total is more than double the number ever previously recorded over the first six months of a year since LDC began its research five years ago. Pubs were among the hardest hit, with a 6.5% decline in numbers over the six-month period as people drink more at home and young people consume less alcohol, while running costs rise. Retailers experiencing the biggest losses were electrical goods stores, fashion shops and news agents. Estate agents also suffered heavy closures. The data reflects a crisis on the high street that has cost tens of thousands of jobs. Major chains including House of Fraser, Evans Cycles, Maplin and Poundworld have collapsed into administration this year while many others, including New Look, Carpetright, Mothercare and Homebase have all been forced to seek legal agreements with their landlords to shut stores and slash their rent bills. High profile restaurant groups including Gourmet Burger Kitchen and rival burger chain Byron as well as Jamie\u2019s Italian, Carluccio\u2019s, and the Prezzo Group have also been forced to close large numbers of outlets as a result of rising costs, slowing spending and a rapid change in consumer habits. The switch to online shopping, combined with a slowdown in spending and rising costs from business rates and wages has battered the profit margins of many retailers. There is also a major shift underway in how consumers spend their leisure time \u2013 as consumers opt to spend more of their spare cash on holidays and experiences rather than in shopping malls, and dine and drink at home . The number of shoppers on the high streets and in retail parks is in decline and the rapid increase in the number of empty shops has prompted fears about the future role of town centres and what can be done to make use of retail property that may never again be wanted by retail and leisure businesses. The LDC report comes as data published on Friday shows the UK high street suffering its ninth negative month in a row for in-store sales. Sales fell by 2% year-on-year in October to mark 13 months since in-store growth exceeded 1%, according to the BDO High Street Sales Tracker. October should mark the start of the \u201cgolden quarter\u201d for retailers, as shoppers start to gear up for Christmas. But Sophie Michael, head of retail and wholesale at BDO, said the second poor October in a row was a \u201creal worry\u201d for stores. Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium, said retailers\u2019 profit margins were being squeezed by rising business rates and increased import costs. At the same time shoppers\u2019 ability to spend had been limited by a lack of real wage growth over the last decade. He added: \u201cThe pressure on retailers, which is contributing to store closures, will continue unless the government takes decisive action.\u201d He has also called on the government \u201cto address spiralling business rates for the larger businesses that employ the majority of the UK\u2019s 3.1 million retail workers\u201d. There are some stores still thriving, led by barbers and beauty salons \u2013 whose services cannot be replicated online. Between January and June the number of barber shops rose by 349 while an additional 160 beauty salons, 122 shoe repairers and 50 health clubs opened their doors. There were also 94 new vaping stores and 52 new independent coffee shops. Larger retail groups \u2013 with multiple outlets \u2013 are in retreat. Some 2,692 stores closed down in the first six months of 2018, according to LDC research carried out for advisory firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). In the same period the number of new stores opened by big retailers slumped by a third on 2017 levels to just 1,569. The net loss of chain store shops was therefore 1,123 \u2013 compared with just 222 in the same period a year earlier. Scunthorpe, Whitley Bay and Darlington were among the worst hit towns across the UK, alongside Tamworth in the Midlands. Lisa Hooker, at PwC, said: \u201cThe continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home. The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts. \u201cOpenings simply aren\u2019t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. \u201cLooking ahead, the turmoil facing the sector is unlikely to abate. Store closures already announced in the second half of the year due to administrations and [company restructures] will further intensify the situation.\u201d Pubs were particularly badly hit by recent rises in business rates while more drinkers are choosing to buy discount alcohol from supermarkets and stay at home as a way to save money. Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer &amp; Pub Association, said: \u201cDespite the positive measures announced in the budget, one in three pounds spent in the pub still goes to the taxman and pubs pay, per pound of turnover, more in business rates than any other sector.\u201d Fashion retailers were also among the hardest hit with a more than 300 stores left empty as New Look, Marks &amp; Spencer, Next and Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group, which owns Topshop and Miss Selfridge, all closed stores. Nearly a quarter of all fashion spending is now online. Patrick O\u2019Brien, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201cClothing is where the shift to online is happening fastest. Over \u00a37bn of sales have moved online in clothing and footwear in the last five years. That dwarves any other sector.\u201d O\u2019Brien added that many more fashion stores were likely to close in coming years as the total number of outlets now on high streets was \u201ccompletely unsustainable\u201d. \u201cWe are not expecting the clothing market to return to high levels of growth in physical stores,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall market is expected to grow 1.5% this year, which is all inflation. People are not buying more clothing. The large chains have got a long way to go in closing stores.\u201d Zelf Hussain, a partner at PwC, said the UK should be braced for more high street closures in coming months as the effect of planned closures by troubled companies such as Gourmet Burger Kitchen and Evans, are implemented. He predicted more companies would announce cuts once they\u2019ve banked Christmas takings. In last month\u2019s budget the chancellor Philip Hammond offered business rates relief for small retailers and a planning consultation that could make it easier for some of the UK\u2019s 50,000 empty shops to be converted into homes or other uses.",

But Sophie Michael, head of retail and wholesale at BDO, said the second poor October in a row was a \u201creal worry\u201d for stores.</p> \n<p>Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium, said<strong> </strong>retailers\u2019<strong> </strong>profit margins were being squeezed by rising business rates and increased import costs. At the same time shoppers\u2019 ability to spend had been limited by a lack of real wage growth over the last decade.</p> \n<p>He added:<strong> \u201c</strong>The pressure on retailers, which is contributing to store closures, will continue unless the government takes decisive action.\u201d He has also called on the government \u201cto address spiralling business rates for the larger businesses that employ the majority of the UK\u2019s 3.1 million retail workers\u201d. </p> \n<p>There are some stores still thriving, led by barbers and beauty salons \u2013 whose services cannot be replicated online. Between January and June the number of barber shops rose by 349 while an additional 160 beauty salons, 122 shoe repairers and 50 health clubs opened their doors. There were also 94 new vaping stores and 52 new independent coffee shops.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2018-11-08T20:14:10/embed.html\" data-alt=\"growing graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2018-11-08T20:14:10/embed.html\">growing graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Larger retail groups \u2013 with multiple outlets \u2013 are in retreat. Some 2,692 stores closed down in the first six months of 2018, according to LDC research carried out for advisory firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). In the same period the number of new stores opened by big retailers slumped by a third on 2017 levels to just 1,569. The net loss of chain store shops was therefore 1,123 \u2013 compared with just 222 in the same period a year earlier.</p> \n<p>Scunthorpe, Whitley Bay and Darlington were among the worst hit towns across the UK, alongside Tamworth in the Midlands.</p> \n<p>Lisa Hooker, at PwC, said: \u201cThe continued rate of store closures reflects the new reality that many of us prefer to shop online and increasingly eat, drink and entertain at home. The high street is adapting to an overcapacity in retail and leisure space resulting from these channel shifts.</p> \n<p>\u201cOpenings simply aren\u2019t replacing the closures at a fast enough rate. </p> \n<p>\u201cLooking ahead, the turmoil facing the sector is unlikely to abate. Store closures already announced in the second half of the year due to administrations and [company restructures] will further intensify the situation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pubs were particularly badly hit by recent rises in business rates while more drinkers are choosing to buy discount alcohol from supermarkets and stay at home as a way to save money.</p> \n<p>Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer &amp; Pub Association, said: \u201cDespite the positive measures announced in the budget, one in three pounds spent in the pub still goes to the taxman and pubs pay, per pound of turnover, more in business rates than any other sector.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/11/net_change_by_region/giv-3902gF7boA7ofVkV/\" data-alt=\"regional graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/11/net_change_by_region/giv-3902gF7boA7ofVkV/\">regional graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Fashion retailers were also among the hardest hit with a more than 300 stores left empty as New Look, Marks &amp; Spencer, Next and Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group, which owns Topshop and Miss Selfridge, all closed stores.

      "bodyText": "It was once the heart of Mercia, the Anglo-Saxon kingdom that ruled large swathes of the Midlands, growing over the centuries into a bustling market town. Until 2001, it was home to Reliant Motors \u2013 the company behind the much-loved three-wheeler Reliant Robin car \u2013 while its credentials as a place to visit were boosted in 1994 by the opening of the Snowdome, the UK\u2019s first indoor real snow ski slope. But in recent times Tamworth, like so many towns, has suffered a flurry of high-street shop closures as traditional retailers succumb to the rise of multi-billion pound internet giants. More than 4,400 stores, restaurants and pubs disappeared across the UK in the first half of this year, according to analysis of 3,000 towns and cities by the Local Data Company, the worst result since it began compiling the data in 2014. Along the high street in Tamworth, Staffordshire, a dozen shops pulled down their shutters for good, while just three opened. On Thursday, locals in the quiet town centre spoke of how scores of high-street stalwarts have deserted the place over the years. A Remembrance Day poppy seller, Belle Jenkinson, has witnessed the decline first hand since she moved to the town 17 years ago. Perched on a chair in front of a derelict shopfront in Ankerside Shopping Centre, the 76-year-old widow said: \u201cIt\u2019s changed drastically since we\u2019ve been here, shops closing. At the moment there\u2019s more phone shops and charity shops than anything.\u201d The pensioner, a driver in the Women\u2019s Royal Army Corps in Northern Ireland in the 1960s before the Troubles started, has been selling poppies in the shopping centre for the last eight years and has watched more and more shops shut. \u201cThey keep closing. These clothes shops come for Christmas then come January they will probably disappear. They open up just for a short time and they disappear again,\u201d she explained, pointing out another nearby vacant premises. Clive Summers, a metalwork furnaceman who served 15 years in the army, has lived in Tamworth most of his life and watched it change beyond all recognition. The 56-year-old said: \u201cIt was a beautiful place to come. You could come down here and do your weekly shop, now you\u2019ve got to go to different places, which is sad. You see this going on all over the country.\u201d Summers said Tamworth Castle, a popular local tourist attraction, brings visitors but he believed more would come if there were not so many shops closing. His wife Julia, a care worker, added: \u201cThey all go out of Tamworth to go to the big shops in Birmingham. You can\u2019t get what you want here.\u201d John Prince, 47, who has managed Peter Coates butchers in Tamworth for the past five years, says three competitors have closed down during that time, as dwindling town centre custom meant only the best quality produce would still sell. Other locals are more upbeat, but accept that Tamworth, population 77,000, faces challenges familiar to many British towns. John Westwood, 74, ran a delicatessen for 30 years before retiring nine years ago and selling it. But earlier this year he decided to buy it back again to revive its ailing fortunes. Five weeks into the new venture, he said: \u201cBecause I\u2019m very well known to the clientele, I\u2019ve managed to pick trade up a little bit, but it\u2019s not what it was nine years ago.\u201d He put the change down to factors such as parking charges and punishing business rates. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to encourage [people to come here]. We\u2019re just a town now of banks, building societies and charity shops.\u201d Asked about the economic difficulties affecting his constituents, the Tory MP for Tamworth, Christopher Pincher, declined to comment. Cllr Steve Claymore, the cabinet member for heritage and growth on the Conservative-run local council, pointed out that Tamworth was voted one of the country\u2019s three best town centres as part of the Great British High Street awards in 2015, adding that regeneration was a \u201cmain priority\u201d. \u201cIn recent years we have seen the closure of some major retail chains nationally and this is affecting all high streets as shopping habits change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe decline also appears more significant because Tamworth did not suffer as much as other areas in previous years. However, Tamworth has some fantastic award-winning businesses, and as a council we work hard to support them where possible.\u201d But Cllr Simon Peaple, leader of the Labour opposition, said town planning had failed to keep up with the realities of a rapidly changing world. \u201cWe had a lovely cheese shop and 25 years ago, Margaret\u2019s cheese shop was quite the thing,\u201d said Peaple. \u201cPeople would buy brie and camembert on a Saturday morning, but then Sainsbury\u2019s comes and Asda comes and all those places offer a range of cheeses.\u201d \u201cWe had a specialist craft shop and then Hobbycraft opened in [the retail park] Ventura Park and then they went too.\u201d The developer Henry Boot bought the town centre shopping precinct Gungate just before the financial crash, but struggled to attract big name retailers to help revive it. \u201cThey misjudged it and sat on it empty. Anybody coming from a major firm takes one look at it and thinks, nobody\u2019s investing here, why would we?\u201d \u201cThe reality is that 30% of shopping is done online. Those trends are bigger than any one council can deal with.\u201d The council recently bought Gungate back, but Peaple has been frustrated by \u201cdithering\u201d about what to do with it, amid disagreement about whether to aim for residential development rather than fight a losing battle to revive the retail sector. He also fears for the future employment prospects of the shoppers needed to keep Tamworth\u2019s tills ringing. One of the biggest local industries is logistics, employing hundreds of people at the local Birch Coppice distribution centre, a cluster of warehouses off the M42. \u201cThat\u2019s provided a lot of jobs, but if they have driverless lorries and workerless warehouses soon, then God help us,\u201d Peaple said.",

    "webTitle": "Toshiba's failure shows private sector cannot deliver nuclear future for UK | Phillip Inman", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If the government was keen to boost Britain\u2019s nuclear industry, it was always clear that the private market would struggle to deliver. The decision by Toshiba to close down its UK operations is a case in point. After the deal to build new reactors at Hinkley Point with the French firm EDF, Toshiba was favoured by ministers to design and construct a smaller power station on the Cumbrian coast. Hinkley was a deal that appeared to be with a private company but the really meaningful talks were between Whitehall officials and their counterparts in the French government, EDF\u2019s controlling shareholder. It took years of agonising brinkmanship to conclude the talks, much of them conducted on the French side by the then economy minister, Emmanuel Macron. Toshiba, on the other hand, is a private company struggling on its own to navigate the complex politics surrounding nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. In 2006 it bought the US nuclear business Westinghouse, part of British Nuclear Fuels and home to much of the UK\u2019s nuclear power industry. With climate change creeping to the top of the agenda and demand for new nuclear plants around the world growing, it seemed like a good idea. However, the 2011 Fukushima disaster changed all that. Governments in Japan and other countries halted the development of new nuclear plants. Last year, cost overruns on building the first new US nuclear power plants in three decades pushed Westinghouse into bankruptcy and Toshiba into financial meltdown. The future of the Cumbrian nuclear plant has been in doubt ever since. Earlier this year Toshiba sold Westinghouse to a private equity outfit as a services provider for existing nuclear plants. The construction of new reactors was not on the agenda. To no one\u2019s surprise, Toshiba has now confirmed it has abandoned building any new plants in the UK. Without entering the argument about whether nuclear is a good option \u2013 and the government advisory body, the National Infrastructure Commission, is unequivocal that renewables such as wind and solar were going to be a safer, cheaper option \u2013 it is clear huge commitments of time, resources and political capital are necessary for infrastructure projects of this scale to get off the ground and through to completion. Amazon delivers further misery to UK high streets On Thursday, Amazon unveiled the architectural plans for a new \u201cfulfilment centre\u201d covering the north-east. Such is the banality of its design, it will fail to dazzle and amaze anyone who passes it on the A66 outside Darlington. Nobody will be distracted by its grey exterior and shed-like construction. The Angel of the North will look down and cry. And yet this architectural crime will be nothing compared to the damage it is likely to cause to high streets across the north-east, and none more so than Darlington\u2019s, which has already lost many of its bigger shops. Analysts at PwC say the north-east has seen a net loss of 72 shops in the first half of 2018. These are the outlets of multiple retailers and the report therefore leaves outside its ambit the many independent shops that have gone to the wall. The north-east was not even the worst. The West Midlands lost 89 of its larger shops. Among the latest to announce closures are Evans Cycles, Debenhams, House of Fraser and New Look. Marks &amp; Spencer is shrinking its high street footprint, as are many others. The trend is unstoppable and affecting everywhere. London is not immune, despite the welter of tourists charging through the West End and beyond. London saw 448 large shops open and 716 close, giving a net loss of 268. Former chancellor George Osborne knew the high street was dying back in 2015. A smart cookie, he hatched a plan to put councils in charge of business rates, the tax that all bricks-and-mortar businesses pay based on the rentable value of their property. Just a quick look at the Amazon shed shows that its rentable value will be a fraction of the shops it replaces. And in the town centres, the trajectory for rateable values is only going down. Osborne\u2019s scheme is inspired by the US, where mayors and local governments bargain away tax revenues in return for factories, distribution sheds and the like being located in their areas. Jobs, any jobs, are their priority. Which raises the questions, are the 3,500 Amazon jobs on the outskirts of Darlington the equivalent of shop worker positions in the town? Not when towns are hollowed out, tax revenues plummet and the quality of local jobs slumps.",

It took years of agonising brinkmanship to conclude the talks, much of them conducted on the French side by the then economy minister, Emmanuel Macron.</p> <p>Toshiba, on the other hand, is a private company struggling on its own to navigate the complex politics surrounding nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.</p> <p>In 2006 it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jan/24/nuclearindustry.environment\">bought the US nuclear business Westinghouse</a>, part of British Nuclear Fuels and home to much of the UK\u2019s nuclear power industry.

Governments in Japan and other countries halted the development of new nuclear plants. Last year, cost overruns on building the first new US nuclear power plants in three decades pushed Westinghouse into bankruptcy and Toshiba into financial meltdown. The future of the Cumbrian nuclear plant has been in doubt ever since.</p> <p>Earlier this year Toshiba <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/video/2018/01/05/toshiba-gains-after-46bn-deal-to-sell-we?videoId=378331177\">sold Westinghouse</a> to a private equity outfit as a services provider for existing nuclear plants. The construction of new reactors was not on the agenda. To no one\u2019s surprise, Toshiba has now confirmed it has abandoned building any new plants in the UK.</p> <p>Without entering the argument about whether nuclear is a good option \u2013 and the government advisory body, the National Infrastructure Commission, is unequivocal that renewables such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/jul/10/government-needs-u-turn-over-mania-for-nuclear-plants\">wind and solar</a> were going to be a safer, cheaper option \u2013 it is clear huge commitments of time, resources and political capital are necessary for infrastructure projects of this scale to get off the ground and through to completion.</p> <h2>Amazon delivers further misery to UK high streets</h2> <p>On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/business/business-news/developers-unveil-how-amazons-north-15384101\">Amazon unveiled the architectural plans for a new \u201cfulfilment centre\u201d</a> covering the north-east.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has eschewed a John Lewis-style blockbuster Christmas ad in favour of a TV and social media campaign starring Celebrity Juice duo Holly Willoughby and Keith Lemon with a sharper focus on its products and prices. Last year the struggling retailer\u2019s ads featured Paddington, but while the ad attracted nearly 7m views on YouTube alone, its Christmas sales were a washout. So instead of blowing this year\u2019s marketing budget on a cinematic ad, M&amp;S has decided to spend the cash on airing it. Nathan Ansell, its director of marketing for clothing and home, said customers would see the ad 10 times as often as last year\u2019s: \u201cIt\u2019s a more efficient use of our spend. CGI [computer-generated imagery] is quite expensive. The world\u2019s moved on [from blockbuster Christmas ads] \u2026 The most important thing is people remember the product and come out and shop.\u201d With M&amp;S\u2019s female customers typically aged over 50, the presence of Willoughby is part of the retailer\u2019s drive to attract younger female shoppers. In the ad the 37-year-old daytime TV presenter wears a series of outfits including a \u00a335 leopard-print miniskirt and an \u00a389 purple coat. But the big question is whether shoppers will actually be able to buy Willoughby\u2019s outfits. The TV star curates a seasonal collection of her clothing \u201cmust-haves\u201d, but some of the autumn picks, such as a \u00a349.50 leopard-print dress, sold out in some sizes within hours, with Steve Rowe, the boss of M&amp;S, admitting it was \u201cletting customers down\u201d. However, ahead of the launch of Willoughby\u2019s festive wardrobe choices Ansell said: \u201cWe have learned from that and made sure we have got more stock for customers.\u201d The ad features 15 times as much M&amp;S product as last year, with Ansell describing it as a more commercial approach designed to drive sales. The crowd-pleasing ad, which airs for the first time on Tuesday, features a guest appearance from the model David Gandy doing the washing-up in a pair of Marigolds, and a homage to Bridget Jones designed to flog its Christmas knitwear. Keith Lemon, the irreverent alter ego of comedian Leigh Francis, is also a surprise addition to the festive episode of its Instagram food series, which already features Amanda Holden and Paddy McGuinness. Retailers\u2019 festive commercials kick-start the annual battle for hearts and minds in what is dubbed the \u201cgolden quarter\u201d, with \u00a398.8bn expected to be spent at UK shops and online in the last three months of 2018, according to analysts at GlobalData, which is a small increase on last year. While Aldi, Tesco, Boots and Argos have already kicked off their campaigns, Britons are still on tenterhooks ahead of the launch of the main event, the John Lewis ad, which this year is expected to feature Elton John. But with high street chains, including John Lewis, struggling amid weak consumer confidence, there is evidence that some retailers are scrimping on their Christmas TV ad spending this year. ITV, which accounts for about half the \u00a34.5bn UK TV ad market, has warned that it is braced for an 8% fall in advertising spend in December. Waitrose will unveil its advert during Coronation Street on Friday night, with a gimmick that will see the preceding ads fast forwarded to reach its commercial. The ruse is in keeping with its strapline that its food is \u201ctoo good to wait\u201d for. Visa is also running a Christmas ad for the first time, which, with a cast of nine real shopkeepers, aims to encourage Britons to visit their local high street After reporting its worst foodhall sales for a decade this week, the low-key M&amp;S food ads make a virtue of its lower prices and are a departure from the \u201cfood porn\u201d commercials of old. However, the campaign got off to a rocky start after the hashtag #MyMarksFave was hijacked by shoppers complaining about poor service in its foodhalls, its high prices and local store closures. \u201cWhile it has been a year of retail failures, profit warnings and store closures so far, the golden quarter offers retailers the opportunity to gain sales from consumers who are finally ready to prioritise shopping,\u201d said GlobalData analyst Patrick O\u2019Brien. However, he predicted low consumer confidence and confusion over Brexit would hit sales of high-priced gifts, while discount chains would benefit from shoppers looking to save money where they could.",
