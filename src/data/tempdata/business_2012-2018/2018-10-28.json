      "bodyText": "Ryanair will come under increased pressure this week to bring in fresh leadership, as investors call for its chairman, David Bonderman, to stand down after more than 20 years. As well as calling for Bonderman to be replaced, the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF) has told the Irish airline to start planning for a successor to Michael O\u2019Leary, who has been chief executive since 1994. The LAPFF chair, Ian Greenwood, has written to Michael Cawley, the chair of Ryanair\u2019s nomination committee, saying it will file the resolutions in favour of the changes at the Dublin-listed firm\u2019s next annual meeting in September 2019. LAPFF has not received a response to the letter, sent on 12 October. LAPFF, which represents the pension funds of local authorities across the UK holding combined assets worth more than \u00a3230bn, holds about 1% of Ryanair\u2019s shares. Under Irish company law, investors holding 3% of shares can introduce a resolution, meaning LAPFF must seek the support of other large investors. It is likely the resolution will gain the backing of enough shareholders, after almost 30% of shareholders voted against Bonderman\u2019s reappointment at the last annual meeting, in September. Royal London Asset Management said it would continue to vote against the reappointment of Bonderman until a new chair is appointed. Aberdeen Standard\u2019s investment director, Alison Kennedy, has indicated that her firm will vote in favour of a resolution to remove Bonderman in 2019 unless Ryanair makes \u201cclear progress on succession\u201d. However, Aberdeen Standard, which holds a stake of about 0.9%, backed Bonderman at this year\u2019s vote to avoid \u201cunintended consequences\u201d. Ryanair issued a statement saying: \u201cRyanair shareholders recently passed all AGM resolutions by a large majority, including the nomination of directors and chairman. They appreciate how fortunate we are to have an outstanding chairman like David Bonderman [to] guide the board and the airline.\u201d The growing pressure on the Ryanair board follows a torrid year for the budget airline. During the summer and early autumn, staff across Europe staged a series of strikes in disputes over contract terms, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights. Ryanair last week officially recognised unions in Belgium, Spain, Portugal and the UK in a bid to improve relations with workers. \u201cRyanair faces a prolonged transition to a more stable employment model and improved industrial relations,\u201d Greenwood wrote in his letter to Ryanair. He said the firm\u2019s \u201cgovernance has not kept pace\u201d with changes needed in its operating model. \u201cWe consider that more genuinely independent representation on the board could have ensured that these changes were achieved more smoothly,\u201d he wrote. Bonderman has spent more than two decades as chairman of the Ryanair board, after joining in 1996. The billionaire private equity investor was last year forced to resign from the board of the taxi app firm Uber following sexist comments about the gender balance on the US company\u2019s board. He has indicated that he intends to stay on for another year, but investors want action sooner. LAPFF said it had concerns over Bonderman\u2019s ability to challenge executives\u2019 decisions, although his presence is considered to be emblematic of a broader lack of independence on the board. Kyran McLaughlin, another member of the board, was also the target of a rebellion at the September meeting on the grounds of independence. Almost a third of investors voted against his reappointment. Disquiet among investors grew last year when a rostering blunder forced the airline to cancel thousands of flights, denting the reputation of the hard-driving management team. Ryanair has since endured more unwelcome media coverage in the last fortnight, after a man allegedly racially abused a fellow passenger before takeoff from Barcelona. The firm was also forced to issue a profit warning last month, blaming the effects of strikes as well as rising oil prices for lower earnings. O\u2019Leary last week predicted that some airlines could go bust over the winter as Ryanair reported a 7% drop in profits for the six months to the end of September. He also indicated he would stay in post for another two or three years as long as he has the support of the board.",

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond is a fiscal conservative. He wants taxes to be as low as possible, would like to see the government balancing its books and is unhappy with national debt at its current levels. The chancellor\u2019s problem, as he prepares for the budget, is that he is one of a dying breed. There are no longer many fiscal conservatives around, even in his own party. Theresa May made life trickier for Hammond when she used her Conservative party conference speech to announce that the public needed to know that all their hard work in helping to repair the state\u2019s finances since the financial crisis had paid off and that austerity was over. While there would be no borrowing binge, \u201cthe British people need to know that the end is in sight. And our message to them must be this: we get it.\u201d What the prime minister actually meant by the end of austerity is open to interpretation. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that at a bare minimum it involves binning the planned spending cuts for Whitehall departments. Another thinktank, the Resolution Foundation, thinks that it means going further and that more money should be found to cancel the fourth and final year of the benefit freeze and to restore the cuts to universal credit. In political terms, it doesn\u2019t really matter which definition is used: the age of austerity that began with George Osborne\u2019s June 2010 budget has run its course. That initial package of measures from the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition administration did much damage to the economy. It slowed a recovery still in its early stages and set Britain on a low-growth, weak-productivity path from which it has never really recovered. But in one way Osborne\u2019s plan to front-load austerity and get the pain over as quickly as possible made sense, and that\u2019s because as chancellor he knew that the lesson of history was that voters would eventually grow weary of cuts. If you look back to the election of 1951, for example, Britain had been subject to strict rationing for well over a decade. The cost of fighting the Korean war involved tax increases and cuts in the weekly allowance of butter, cheese and bacon. As Ken Morgan wrote in his book Labour in Power: \u201cThe British public after years of austerity were now being faced with new and even more insupportable burdens.\u201d Labour won a bigger share of the vote at the 1951 election than it has achieved before or since, but austerity fatigue had set in. There was a limit to the sacrifices people were prepared to make and, just as crucially, for how long they were prepared to make them. At some point between the 2015 election, which the Conservatives narrowly won, and the 2017 election, at which they lost their overall majority, the mood changed. The public decided that enough was enough. Hammond\u2019s budget will acknowledge the new political reality. He has already let it be known that he will find the extra money the prime minister has promised for the health service, that he will again freeze fuel duty, that the Treasury will allow local authorities to start building houses again and that there will be a package of support for struggling high streets. The chancellor also used his pre-budget interview on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show to drop a broad hint that there would be more money for universal credit. Even so, Hammond\u2019s message in the budget will be that he is taking a balanced approach: some additional spending but in the context of keeping taxes low, reducing debt as a share of national output and investing in Britain\u2019s future. Achieving these four objectives is going to be tough, even allowing for the marked improvement in the public finances seen since the spring. In the first six months of the 2018-19 financial year, the government borrowed just under \u00a320bn \u2013 almost \u00a311bn less than in the same period a year earlier. This improvement is expected to persist and provides the chancellor with some useful headroom, but won\u2019t be enough to meet all four objectives. Something will have to give: either taxes will have to go up, Hammond\u2019s debt and deficit objectives will have to be scaled back, or the spending squeeze will need to continue. The chancellor\u2019s budget preparations have also been clouded by uncertainty about Brexit. By now, the Treasury expected the shape of a deal to be clear, but the fact that many outcomes are still possible has meant that Hammond feels the need to maintain enough fiscal firepower to respond in the event of negotiations collapsing. This is a budget that could rapidly be overtaken by events. Even so, this is still a big political moment because the government needs to be able to frame the end of austerity \u2013 however defined \u2013 in such a way that it doesn\u2019t appear to be a defeat or an admission that the sacrifices have all been for nothing. As the fall of the last Labour government shows, keeping control of the narrative is vital. In three successive elections, 1997, 2001 and 2005, Labour\u2019s line was that the economy needed public investment more than it needed tax cuts. All the time that the debate was framed in this way, the Conservatives were kept on the back foot. In 2010, the argument was turned on its head. David Cameron became prime minister because the election was fought on the basis of which party was best equipped to cut spending. There is now a sense that the terms of the debate are once again shifting, with Labour saying that eight years of austerity have been both painful and economically harmful. Hammond has to persuade the public otherwise; and it is quite a challenge.",

      "bodyText": "As the price of oil moves upwards, expectations are that BP\u2019s fortunes will also be gathering momentum. This week, the company is set to reveal its results for the third quarter, and forecasts are positive. The price of oil recently hit a four-year high and some commentators think it could reach $100 a barrel by the end of the year \u2013 a price not seen since 2014. Looming Iranian sanctions in November, supply problems in the US and a lack of spare capacity among the big Opec producers are all conspiring to drive the price up. It is widely expected that BP will continue to see the benefit and report positive numbers on Tuesday. The upturn for the company comes after years of being dogged by the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. In January, the company said it was nearing the end of the $65bn (\u00a347bn) compensation process. BP had been hamstrung in recent years by the legacy of the explosion and oil spill at the Macondo well, which killed 11 people and caused huge environmental damage. But chief executive Bob Dudley has said that 2017 felt like a turning point, and this week\u2019s results are expected to show a company that is continuing to emerge from the aftermath of that disaster. The second quarter was already starting to tell \u201ca story of a turnaround\u201d, according to analysts Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cPayments associated with the Deepwater Horizon disaster are falling, while a higher oil price boosted revenues in Q2. That helped second-quarter profit hit $2.8bn, way ahead of the $684m from a year before.\u201d Graham Spooner, from The Share Centre, said the rising price of oil should have a clear effect. \u201cWe have seen steadily improving numbers from the oil majors as oil prices have steadied, but for the third quarter, when oil prices breached $85 a barrel, a significant improvement in profitability should be expected. This is on the proviso that production did not suffer any setbacks \u2013 and judging by the first half, plant reliability and uptime was high,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors should expect production to rise, though, as new production facilities have come online, while we will also see the inclusion of production from the acquisition of shale assets from BP.\u201d Across the board, the oil industry is currently reaping the benefits of the boom. Last week, the Norwegian oil and gas firm Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, announced earnings before interest and taxes of $4.8bn for the third quarter, slightly below market expectations but almost double what it made last year. French oil giant Total raised its production growth target for 2018 after a new record output, and high oil prices during the third quarter enabled it to report its highest net income in a quarter since 2012. During the summer, BP agreed to buy US shale oil and gas fields from the Anglo-Australian mining group BHP for $10.5bn (\u00a38bn), the firm\u2019s biggest acquisition in nearly two decades. Dudley lauded the deal as transformational and industry watchers said it significantly beefed up the company\u2019s shale presence in America, which had been small compared to its peers. Oil prices have slumped and soared in recent years. As recently as 2016, Opec overproduction and rising US shale output created a glut, pushing the global benchmark Brent and US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices to less than $30 a barrel. Since then prices have recovered to about $76 for Brent.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Labour peer who named Sir Philip Green as the businessman accused of bullying and sexual harassment has said he will \u201cneither retract nor apologise for standing up for human rights\u201d, after the retail mogul said he would lodge a formal complaint against him with the House of Lords. Responding to criticism that he did not disclose his financial links to the law firm representing the newspaper that broke the story of the allegations, Peter Hain told the Observer: \u201cI always comply fully with my House of Lords obligations, as I did on that occasion. His [Green\u2019s] complaint is a malevolent diversion.\u201d Hain used the legal protections of the House of Lords to name Green on Thursday. He said on Saturday that he respected the opinion of lawyers who disagreed with his intervention, but stood by his decision to name Green, who had secured an injunction preventing details of the case from being made public. \u201cI stand resolutely by what I\u2019ve said and neither retract nor apologise for standing up for human rights,\u201d he said. Hain added that he had not taken the decision lightly, and defended his right to use parliamentary privilege to support \u201cjustice and liberty\u201d. On Friday, Green said it was \u201coutrageous\u201d for Hain to name him, and he would lodge a formal complaint with the House of Lords. \u201cTo the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations,\u201d he said. Hain said that he had used parliamentary privilege only three times in a parliamentary career spanning almost 30 years, and then only after \u201cdeep consideration\u201d. \u201cParliamentary privilege is a precious part of our constitution and an expression of parliament\u2019s absolute sovereignty, but it should only ever be used sparingly, with total integrity and responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not something that one should ever abuse and it should never be used randomly. On this occasion, I took a judgment which others will, in turn, assess as being right or wrong and I respect that. I respect the view of lawyers who criticise it, though others have supported it. \u201cWhat is the point of being a member of parliament, either in the Commons or in the Lords, if you don\u2019t discharge your responsibilities and, where appropriate, use the privileges that you have in order to promote justice and liberty?\u201d The former attorney general Dominic Grieve has been among those to criticise Hain\u2019s move, claiming that the former Labour cabinet minister has abused parliamentary privilege and acted arrogantly. It emerged that Hain was a paid adviser to Gordon Dadds, the law firm instructed by the Daily Telegraph in its attempts to name Green. Hain has said he took the decision to name Green \u201cin my personal capacity as an independent member of the House of Lords. I categorically state that I was completely unaware Gordon Dadds were advising the Telegraph regarding this case\u201d. A spokesman for Gordon Dadds denied \u201cany suggestion that Gordon Dadds LLP has in any way acted improperly\u201d. Hain told the Observer that he had previously used parliamentary privilege to name arms dealers while a minister, and later used it in the House of Lords to name companies with alleged links to former South African president, Jacob Zuma. \u201cI used parliamentary privilege to name a dozen arms dealers who were flying arms to Sierra Leone, some of which were turned on British soldiers trying to defeat the terrorist group there,\u201d he said. \u201cArms were also being sent to Angola, fuelling a bloody and traumatic civil war, and to the Congo, where they were also being used to promote conflict. These arms dealers were being paid in illegal diamonds. On the second occasion, I was passed information by very brave whistleblowers to whom I was introduced by ANC stalwarts horrified by what was going on under President Zuma\u2019s corrupt presidency. \u201cThat is three times during my time as a parliamentarian, dating back to 1991. So it is not something I have ever done lightly. The first two cases were clear-cut, though it hadn\u2019t been done before. And on this third occasion, obviously I did not do this lightly, either. It was after deep consideration.\u201d Zelda Perkins, Harvey Weinstein\u2019s former personal assistant who went public last year to accuse the disgraced Hollywood film producer of assaulting a colleague in London and has since led a campaign to ban non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), said the Green saga underlined the need to review their use in the workplace. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any reason or any time when they are acceptable,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cI know people shout out that it protects the victim as well, but it only protects the victim because of the current climate. There shouldn\u2019t be any shame or fear about calling out bad behaviour \u2013 but at the moment the environment is skewed to help the perpetrator.\u201d The government is reportedly considering prohibiting NDAs about sexual harassment in the workplace, but Perkins said: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t just be that NDAs are banned around sexual harassment. It\u2019s about discrimination, it\u2019s about race, environmental accidents \u2013 it\u2019s about people in power.\u201d",
