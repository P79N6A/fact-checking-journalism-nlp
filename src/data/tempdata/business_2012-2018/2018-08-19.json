      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturing industry has fallen to ninth in the world behind France, reversing a recovery in its performance since the financial crash. The UK\u2019s total manufacturing output stayed ahead of Brazil and Indonesia but slipped below France and remained well adrift of Germany in fourth position and Italy in seventh at the end of 2016. The figures show a troubling decline in the UK\u2019s international standing after the Brexit vote and emphasises the uphill task of regaining its position of seventh achieved in 2007. China kept the top spot ahead of the US and Japan while South Korea and India were fifth and sixth respectively. Recent data shows the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector being starved of investment funds and losing momentum as uncertainty persists surrounding the the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU from next year. A report in June found that the sector had lost 600,000 jobs in the past 10 years to leave it employing fewer than 3 million workers. In 2007, the UK supported 3.5m permanent and temporary manufacturing jobs \u2013 more than 12% of all British employment \u2013 but by 2016 that had fallen to 2.9m , or 9.2% of total employment, said the GMB trade union, which published the report. The EEF, the manufacturer\u2019s trade body that published the figures, said the sector \u201cpunched above its weight\u201d and was of vital importance to the UK\u2019s economic health. It said workers\u2019 average pay was higher than the national average and that productivity growth remained strong. A study showed that jobs in the sector paid an average of \u00a332,500, above the national average estimated by the ONS at \u00a327,271, rising to almost \u00a340,000 for a skilled post in a car factory. Lee Hopley, the chief economist at the EEF, said productivity growth was up by 3.1% since 2012, above the average for all sectors in the economy, and had reached double figures in the electronics industry. \u201cOur latest data continue to show that UK manufacturing punches above its weight in some vital areas of the economy and contributes more than the sum of its parts. This is reflected regionally, in productivity and pay levels, for millions of people working in the sector,\u201d he said. \u201cIt provides an important reminder that we\u2019re still one of the top 10 biggest manufacturing nations and we want to see policy makers working with industry to help move UK manufacturing up the rankings.\u201d The car industry offered the highest average pay at \u00a339,800, beating the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries into second place with an average salary of \u00a339,500. The food and drink industry was the worst for pay, offering an average salary of just \u00a327,600. But while the electronics sector achieved a 13.5% increase in productivity and electrical equipment makers gained 12.3% between 2012 and 2017, food and drink producers saw a decline in productivity of 1.5%. More than 390,000 workers are employed in the food manufacturing sector compared with 180,000 workers in the car industry. Machinery and metals manufacturers also suffered declines in productivity of 2% and 3% respectively since 2012. Productivity, which measures the amount produced by each worker per hour, is seen as a crucial measure of an industry\u2019s success and its ability to increase workers\u2019 wages. The fall in the UK\u2019s international standing was blamed partly on the fall in sterling since the beginning of 2016, which accelerated after the Brexit vote in June of that year. The international rankings by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) are calculated in dollars, which increased in value against the pound by roughly 25% during 2016.",

      "bodyText": "Households are facing a further round of energy price rises despite the introduction of the government\u2019s price cap, industry experts have warned. Ministers have promised to protect 11 million households on default tariffs with a cap by the end of 2018. Ofgem, the regulator, is due to publish further details of the ceiling early in September. However, new analysis by the energy consultancy Cornwall Insight expects cost pressures to drive up bills by 5%, about \u00a360 a year, by next April. That would take a dual fuel bill based on typical consumption to \u00a31,268 at a time when consumers are already under pressure from slowing wage growth and rising interest rates. While the calculations rest on expectations for the level of a price cap for 5 million vulnerable households, the increases are expected to emerge across the wider market. Robert Buckley, research director at Cornwall Insight, said: \u201cOn the safeguard tariff forecasts, we believe there\u2019s another \u00a360 rise coming in April \u2013 mainly due to policy and wholesale cost increases. These rises will be felt by all suppliers regardless of whether tariffs are capped or not.\u201d He warned that the government\u2019s cap on default tariffs, one of Theresa May\u2019s key policies, could inadvertently make bill payers\u2019 costs higher because of how suppliers buy energy. \u201cThere\u2019s a good argument that the cap will make things worse because the formula it uses to set the wholesale cost element is very difficult to replicate in market hedging,\u201d Buckley said. Gas and electricity bills are expected to level out after next summer and remain at about the same point in summer 2020, according to Cornwall Insight\u2019s research. Half of the big six suppliers \u2013 British Gas, EDF and E.ON \u2013 have already raised prices twice this year. Bulb, a fast-growing challenger firm, recently told its 650,000 customers they might be hit with a third rise in November. Wholesale prices were already 5% higher than in June, the company said, because the heatwave had hit windfarms and nuclear plants, pushing up electricity prices, while demand for putting gas into storage had kept prices high for that fuel. While a third increase by the large suppliers is thought unlikely unless wholesale prices rise even higher, industry watchers said it was possible that at least one of the remaining big six would soon announce a second increase. Deepa Venkateswaran, an analyst at Bernstein bank, said there was \u201cno respite yet\u201d from wholesale costs because commodities were \u201cstrong across the board\u201d. One industry insider said SSE was regarded as the most likely of the big six to announce a second rise in the near future, because it had the cheapest standard variable tariff of the pack and a sizeable number of customers on the default tariffs. Npower and ScottishPower are thought less likely to declare a second increase because their prices are already higher. All energy suppliers are facing higher wholesale costs because the recovery in the oil price has helped pull up gas prices.",

    "webTitle": "MoJ seizes control of Birmingham prison from G4S", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has been forced to take immediate control of HMP Birmingham from its contractor G4S, after a damning inspection found that prisoners used drink, drugs and violence with impunity and corridors were littered with cockroaches, blood and vomit. The government is having to take the unprecedented step of seizing control of the failing prison, removing its governor and sweeping out hundreds of prisoners on Monday, just hours before an extraordinarily critical report is released by the prisons inspectorate. The state of the category B prison is likely to raise significant questions in the coming days about private sector involvement in the prison system. G4S was awarded a 15-year contract to run the prison in 2011. The chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, said there had been \u201cdramatic deterioration\u201d since the last inspection in early 2017 and the government should launch an urgent inquiry into the appalling state of the prison, the most violent in England and Wales and the site of riots in 2016. Prison gangs perpetrating the violence \u201ccould do so with near impunity\u201d, he said. Inspectors saw prisoners who were evidently under the influence of drink or drugs, which went unchallenged, including widespread use of the psychoactive drug spice. Staff were fearful and experienced widespread bullying, the report said, and inspectors witnessed an arson attack on a supposedly secure staff car park during their inspection. Prison officers often had little grasp of where prisoners were, the report found. Communal areas were filthy, with cockroaches, vermin, blood and vomit left uncleaned, and wings that had virtually every window damaged or missing. Clarke said the report contained \u201csome of the most disturbing evidence that inspectors ... have seen in any prison.\u201d In his letter to the justice secretary, David Gauke, Clarke said there was an \u201curgent and pressing need to address the squalor, violence, prevalence of drugs and looming lack of control\u201d. Clarke said he was \u201castounded that HMP Birmingham had been allowed to deteriorate so dramatically\u201d. He said he had no confidence in the ability of the prison to make improvements. \u201cThere has clearly been an abject failure of contract management and delivery \u2026 the inertia that seems to have gripped both those monitoring the contract and delivering it on the ground has led to one of Britain\u2019s leading jails slipping into a state of crisis.\u201d Clarke has invoked an \u201curgent notification protocol\u201d, a device that puts the justice secretary on notice that urgent action is needed to address significant concerns at a jail. The MoJ said it had instigated an intensive period of improvement measures with little success, forcing it to take the prison back under government control. HM Prison and Probation Service will run the prison for an initial six months, before assessing whether control can be returned to G4S. The \u201cstep in\u201d process is not technically nationalisation, but a process allowed when a provider is deemed to have breached its contract to run the prison safely, meaning there is no liability to the taxpayer. No staff redundancies will take place, though the MoJ said it would send in an additional 30 members of experienced prison staff as well as a new governor, Paul Newton, formally of HMP Swaleside. More than 300 prisoners will be moved from the prison while the jail is overhauled. The prisons minister, Rory Stewart, said the conditions in the prison were clearly unacceptable. \u201cIt has become clear that drastic action is required to bring about the improvements we require,\u201d he said. \u201cThis \u2018step in\u2019 means that we can provide additional resources to the prison while insulating the taxpayer from the inevitable cost this entails. \u201cWe have good, privately run prisons across the country and while Birmingham faces its own particular set of challenges, I am absolutely clear that it must start to live up to the standards seen elsewhere.\u201d However, MoJ sources have been keen to stress the government does not believe privatisation was at the root of the prison\u2019s troubles, pointing out that other G4S prisons including HMP Oakwood had recently received good inspection reports. Stewart has staked his own reputation on dramatic improvements to the prison system, telling the BBC he would resign in a year if he has not managed to reduce the level of drugs and violence in 10 target jails, although Birmingham was not among them. The MoJ said it was clear that the prison was still suffering significant effects following the 2016 riots involving more than 600 prisoners, the worst since the infamous Strangeways riots in 1990. The government was forced to send in specially trained Tornado Squad officers, who battled prisoners for more than 12 hours. A report by the independent monitoring board ahead of the riots had warned of the dangers posed by prisoners under the influence of psychoactive drugs including spice and black mamba. Assaults on staff at HMP Birmingham rose 84% to a record high of 164 incidents last year, according to MoJ figures. The \u201cstep in\u201d to take control in Birmingham is the first time such drastic measures have been used mid-contract. In 2016, the government stepped in at the end of its contract with G4S to run Medway Secure Training Centre, after undercover reporters filmed staff apparently mistreating children. The security giant also lost its contract in 2015 to run Rainsbrook STC after prison inspectors graded it inadequate, reporting that some staff behaved \u201cextremely inappropriately\u201d with young people. Jerry Petherick, G4S\u2019s managing director of custody and detention services, said: \u201cHMP Birmingham is an inner-city remand prison which faces exceptional challenges including increasingly high levels of prisoner violence towards staff and fellow prisoners. \u201cThe wellbeing and safety of prisoners and prison staff is our key priority and we welcome the six-month step-in and the opportunity to work with the Ministry of Justice to urgently address the issues faced at the prison.\u201d",

Tracy Clarke, Standard Chartered\u2019s CEO for Europe and the Americas, said the bank has been waiting nearly nine months for EU officials to approve an operating licence that will turn its Frankfurt branch into a subsidiary, but regulators have yet to make a decision. Clarke told the Press Association that German regulators, the European Banking Authority and the European Central Bank (ECB) have become increasingly strict, delaying a licence approval the bank expected in the spring. \u201cBecause we were one of the first (to apply for a licence) there was no precedent for us, or for them. It\u2019s been a learning process on both sides.\u201d Clarke said that while dialogue was constructive, she added: \u201cThey\u2019re getting firmer about what they expect to see, and their stance is therefore becoming a bit tougher.\u201d The ECB has rejected attempts by banks to establish brass plate operations, telling banks they must move significant operations to the EU to sell their services inside political bloc. It now expects banks such as Standard Chartered to create a dedicated outsourcing unit which will have \u201creal teeth\u201d, Clarke said. Standard Chartered, which has customers across Europe, but operates mostly in Asia, is trying to navigate rules around how they outsource tasks across its own subsidiaries. \u201cWe expect that onshore in Germany there will be very strong oversight on anything of any service that is performed offshore,\u201d Clarke said. Ultimately, it means banks such as Standard Chartered may end up moving more jobs due to Brexit than originally planned. \u201cFor us, it still won\u2019t be hundreds more people because of the size and scale of our business, so you might be talking about a few more for us. But if they\u2019re taking this approach with all other banks who are much bigger than we are in terms of their European business, that could be more significant,\u201d she warned. Clarke, who is also chief executive of Standard Chartered private bank, explained that staff dedicated to activities such as trade finance processing or document checking currently sit offshore in some of Standard Chartered\u2019s business hubs in the likes of Chennai, Kuala Lumpur or Tianjin. \u201cWe rely on that in our global business model, we rely on shared services a lot \u2013 either for expertise or for efficiency. So they\u2019re not against that, but there is lots of scrutiny on it,\u201d she said. The ECB, which regulates euro area banks, said it was keen to prevent UK institutions from creating empty shells when granting licences ahead of Brexit. A spokesman said: \u201cTo this end, the ECB will focus on five key areas when assessing licence applications, namely to ensure that subsidiaries have adequate local management capabilities, some access to financial market infrastructures, some hedging and trading capabilities, do not fully rely on intra-group booking and hedging strategies and can provide accurate data on their local activities.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s late August, so things are quiet when it comes to company news. But on Tuesday there are first-half results from housebuilder Persimmon Homes, which is run by the best-paid boss of a public company. Last week\u2019s report by the High Pay Centre showed Jeff Fairburn was paid \u00a347.1m last year \u2013 more than 10 times the \u00a33.9m median figure for a FTSE 100 boss. The average employee at Persimmon would have to work 1,130 years to earn Fairburn\u2019s annual pay. Fairburn\u2019s package was inflated by a long-term incentive plan that paid out \u00a344.9m last year. Persimmon put the plan in place in 2012 when housebuilders were in the doldrums. With no cap on the payout, the result was huge bonuses for Fairburn and his management team when the housing market picked up. Persimmon\u2019s chairman, Nicholas Wrigley, resigned over the payouts in December and almost half the votes at the company\u2019s annual meeting in April opposed them. Fairburn kept all last year\u2019s money but has said he will give up about half of this year\u2019s package, which could be about \u00a360m. He is also setting up a trust to donate some of it to charity. Persimmon has already reported headline figures for its first half, which ended in June. Revenue rose 5% to \u00a31.84bn and completed sales increased 3.6% to 8,072 homes. The average selling price rose 1.2% to \u00a3215,000. That is solid growth \u2013 but the rate of increase has halved from a year earlier. Worries about housebuilders are reflected in their share prices. Persimmon\u2019s shares have fallen about 10% this year compared with a decline of about 1% by the FTSE 100 index. Investors are worried about the slowdown in the property market, prospects for the economy and stretched household finances. Demand for new-build homes has held up better than the wider market, supported by the government\u2019s help-to-buy programme, which subsidises mortgages for new properties. Laith Khalaf, an analyst at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cThe housebuilders have had a pretty good time of it. That has been driven by the low-interest-rate environment and, very significantly, help to buy. The numbers suggest there has been a moderation in that trend and it looks like things are going to be more difficult for the sector.\u201d Persimmon has also benefited from its nationwide spread and lack of projects in central London, where prices are falling and the market is moribund. Markets such as Scotland, the north-west of England and the Midlands are still quite lively. Persimmon is a well-run company that has accelerated its construction programme and builds lots of homes for housing associations. It achieved its profit growth after 2012 without the easy option of building in London, which was at the centre of the boom. But the company has been supported by help to buy: almost half the 16,043 homes Persimmon sold last year had a help-to-buy mortgage. A report by investment bank Morgan Stanley last year argued that the \u00a310bn supplied by the government for the scheme simply went into higher house prices. Last year the chancellor announced an extension of help to buy until 2021. As that date draws nearer, investors may start to fret about how housebuilders will fare without it. That is unless \u2013 like low interest rates \u2013 help to buy becomes a fixture of the post-crisis economy. There was uproar about high pay last week, including calls for the government to take action. But, like the withdrawal of help to buy, if it ever happens Fairburn will already have the money in the bank.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Defenders of the astronomical amounts routinely being trousered by leading executives have a stock response to critics who say that such rewards are excessive. Chief executives have to be paid the going rate. Without the right incentives, these alpha males (and occasionally alpha females) would take their talents elsewhere and everyone would lose. It\u2019s a global marketplace out there. The market rate for talent has to be paid. Having a pop at these titans of industry over their remuneration packages is simply the politics of envy. Interestingly, the same explanation is used to justify the nugatory pay awards executives hand out to their staff. When it comes to people lower down the pay s cale, the message is that jobs can always be outsourced overseas if the workers get too bolshie about pay. The upshot is that the gap between executives and the rest has exploded. In 1965, the gap between what a US chief executive earned and the average worker\u2019s pay was 20 to one. Data last week showed that ratio is now 312 to one. The bosses running the top 350 companies are not only pulling away from their employees: they are also pulling away from the 0.1% of top earners. It is a similar story in the UK. Another survey from last week shows the pay of FTSE 100 chief executives rose six times as fast as those of the wider workforce in 2017. In a year when prices rising faster than earnings meant living standards fell for the bulk of the population, those running the biggest quoted companies saw their remuneration going up by 11%. The rationale for paying executives more is that it results in higher growth, better investment decisions, enhanced productivity and a trickle-down effect that cascades through the economy. In fact, the opposite has happened. In the 1960s, US growth was higher, investment was higher and productivity was higher. A more even division of the spoils meant people could pay their way without getting excessively into debt. In Britain, wages adjusted for inflation are lower than they were before the financial crisis of 2008. Productivity has flatlined because those running companies would rather use profits to buy back shares \u2013 often boosting their own remuneration at the same time \u2013 than on investment in new plant and machinery. The notion that soaring executive pay is vital for the wellbeing of the economy is self-serving tosh. The sense that chief executives are taking the mickey is perhaps best exemplified by the case of Countrywide, Britain\u2019s biggest estate agency group. This is a company that has made four profit warnings since the start of the year and which is now trying to raise \u00a3140m in emergency funding. Along with the rescue package, the board wants shareholders to agree to a new remuneration scheme that could hand its three top executives \u00a320m of shares between them. This is precisely the sort of conduct that ought to lead to a shareholder revolt. Interestingly, Peter Long, the chairman of Countrywide \u2013 who is in line for \u00a36m from this scheme if targets are hit \u2013 is also the chairman of Royal Mail, where a particularly egregious executive pay scheme last month resulted in a 70% shareholder revolt. The political climate has changed as a result of the financial crisis. Before the crash, workers might have grumbled about the pay packages their bosses were getting, but didn\u2019t complain that much because their own pay was also going up. But since 2008, a combination of austerity and pay freezes have created a new political dynamic. If a future Labour government took action to clamp down on executive pay, the move would be wildly popular. Dismissing this reaction as the politics of envy is completely beside the point. In the current circumstances, the politics of envy are both justified and easily understandable. People have had enough. Instagram\u2019s influencers need guiding hand from their backers It\u2019s heartening to know that folks at the Competition and Markets Authority are keeping fingers on the pulse by browsing Z-list celebrities\u2019 Instagram profiles. The competition watchdog has written to some social media \u201cinfluencers\u201d as part of a probe into whether they have breached consumer laws by promoting products without disclosing fees for doing so. These investigations usually involve an interview, with those suspected of transgression asked to adjust their behaviour or face fines. There must be mileage in a reality TV show with Love Island stars being interrogated on the finer points of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. If you could travel back in time and walk into the boardroom of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, one of the CMA\u2019s predecessors, it would be almost impossible to explain what the future of regulation would hold. Such investigations are the bizarre product of a world in which technological developments speed ahead of regulatory ones. From tax treatment of online multinationals to the regulation of industry disruptors such as Uber and AirBnB, tensions regularly emerge between long-held principles and the realities of the modern world. In the case of Instagram\u2019s influencers, however, the existing laws should be perfectly adequate. Those who use the media, social or otherwise, must be clear about any commercial interest behind their promotion of a product. The problem is less about regulation than with the blurring of lines between the person and their brand. Anyone enjoying their 15 minutes of fame is unlikely to consider the ramifications when big brands call with lucrative promotional deals. Perhaps the finger should be pointing at businesses willing to harness the power of Insta-celebs but not to help them navigate consumer law. A third rise in household bills shows we need to switch to clean energy Hundreds of thousands of energy bill payers have been told they could be hit with yet another price rise this year, as if two already weren\u2019t bad enough. So far just Bulb, the UK\u2019s fastest-growing energy supplier, has warned of the risk of a third rise, but many others will be considering similar action. Wholesale electricity and gas prices have marched upwards. Culprits include higher oil prices, Europe\u2019s heatwave ramping up electricity use, and some power output falling, plus the need to replace depleted gas reserves after a cold winter. Ministers say the subsequent tariff increases by energy suppliers are \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and justify the government\u2019s imminent price cap. They urge people to switch. What they don\u2019t mention is most people are virtually guaranteed to see their energy bills climb even higher, despite the cap and regardless of whether they switch. As Ed Miliband has noted repeatedly, a price cap is not the same as his price freeze. The cap is reviewed twice a year by Ofgem and, if costs facing suppliers are up, up goes the cap. The regulator did exactly that recently with its specialist \u201csafeguard\u201d tariff. In the short term, wholesale costs look to be heading in one direction. The US imposition of sanctions against countries that import Iranian crude from November could drive up oil, and therefore gas, prices. The reality is that no single government, let alone an individual, has control over wholesale prices. Consumers with the money can protect themselves from rising energy bills with energy efficiency measures, solar panels and, increasingly, home batteries. Nationally, the only long-term solution is to speed up the switch from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy. That transition won\u2019t come cheap. But as the rising wholesale prices and energy bills remind us, neither does the alternative.",

      "body": "<p>Defenders of the astronomical amounts routinely being trousered by leading executives have a stock response to critics who say that such rewards are excessive. Chief executives have to be paid the going rate. Without the right incentives, these alpha males (and occasionally alpha females) would take their talents elsewhere and everyone would lose. It\u2019s a global marketplace out there. The market rate for talent has to be paid. Having a pop at these titans of industry over their remuneration packages is simply the politics of envy.</p> <p>Interestingly, the same explanation is used to justify the nugatory pay awards executives hand out to their staff. When it comes to people lower down the pay s cale, the message is that jobs can always be outsourced overseas if the workers get too bolshie about pay.</p> <p>The upshot is that the gap between executives and the rest has exploded. In 1965, the gap between what a US chief executive earned and the average worker\u2019s pay was 20 to one. Data last week showed that ratio <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/16/ceo-versus-worker-wage-american-companies-pay-gap-study-2018\">is now 312 to one</a>. The bosses running the top 350 companies are not only pulling away from their employees: they are also pulling away from the 0.1% of top earners.</p> <p>It is a similar story in the UK. Another survey from last week shows the pay of FTSE 100 chief executives rose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/15/uk-top-bosses-pay-rise-average-earnings-hit-39m-2017-high-pay-centre\">six times as fast as those of the wider workforce in 2017</a>. In a year when prices rising faster than earnings meant living standards fell for the bulk of the population, those running the biggest quoted companies saw their remuneration going up by 11%.</p> <p>The rationale for paying executives more is that it results in higher growth, better investment decisions, enhanced productivity and a trickle-down effect that cascades through the economy.</p> <p>In fact, the opposite has happened. In the 1960s, US growth was higher, investment was higher and productivity was higher. A more even division of the spoils meant people could pay their way without getting excessively into debt.</p> <p>In Britain, wages adjusted for inflation are lower than they were before the financial crisis of 2008. Productivity has flatlined because those running companies would rather use profits to buy back shares \u2013 often boosting their own remuneration at the same time \u2013 than on investment in new plant and machinery.</p> <p>The notion that soaring executive pay is vital for the wellbeing of the economy is self-serving tosh. The sense that chief executives are taking the mickey is perhaps best exemplified by the case of Countrywide, Britain\u2019s biggest estate agency group. This is a company that has made four profit warnings since the start of the year and which is now trying to raise \u00a3140m in emergency funding. Along with the rescue package, the board wants shareholders to agree to a new remuneration scheme that could hand its three top executives \u00a320m of shares between them.</p> <p>This is precisely the sort of conduct that ought to lead to a shareholder revolt. Interestingly, Peter Long, the chairman of Countrywide \u2013 who is in line for \u00a36m from this scheme if targets are hit \u2013 is also the chairman of Royal Mail, where a particularly egregious executive pay scheme last month resulted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/19/majority-of-investors-reject-pay-deal-for-royal-mails-chief-executive\">a 70% shareholder revolt</a>.</p> <p>The political climate has changed as a result of the financial crisis. Before the crash, workers might have grumbled about the pay packages their bosses were getting, but didn\u2019t complain that much because their own pay was also going up.</p> <p>But since 2008, a combination of austerity and pay freezes have created a new political dynamic. If a future Labour government took action to clamp down on executive pay, the move would be wildly popular.</p> <p>Dismissing this reaction as the politics of envy is completely beside the point. In the current circumstances, the politics of envy are both justified and easily understandable. People have had enough.</p> <h2>Instagram\u2019s influencers need guiding hand from their backers</h2> <p>It\u2019s heartening to know that folks at the Competition and Markets Authority are keeping fingers on the pulse by browsing Z-list celebrities\u2019 Instagram profiles.</p> <p>The competition watchdog has written to some social media \u201cinfluencers\u201d as part of a probe into whether they have breached consumer laws by promoting products without disclosing fees for doing so.</p> <p>These investigations usually involve an interview, with those suspected of transgression asked to adjust their behaviour or face fines.</p> <p>There must be mileage in a reality TV show with <em>Love Island </em>stars being interrogated on the finer points of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008.</p> <p>If you could travel back in time and walk into the boardroom of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, one of the CMA\u2019s predecessors, it would be almost impossible to explain what the future of regulation would hold.</p> <p>Such investigations are the bizarre product of a world in which technological developments speed ahead of regulatory ones. From tax treatment of online multinationals to the regulation of industry disruptors such as Uber and AirBnB, tensions regularly emerge between long-held principles and the realities of the modern world.</p> <p>In the case of Instagram\u2019s influencers, however, the existing laws should be perfectly adequate.</p> <p>Those who use the media, social or otherwise, must be clear about any commercial interest behind their promotion of a product. The problem is less about regulation than with the blurring of lines between the person and their brand.</p> <p>Anyone enjoying their 15 minutes of fame is unlikely to consider the ramifications when big brands call with lucrative promotional deals. Perhaps the finger should be pointing at businesses willing to harness the power of Insta-celebs but not to help them navigate consumer law.</p> <h2>A third rise in household bills shows we need to switch to clean energy</h2> <p>Hundreds of thousands of energy bill payers have been told they could be hit with yet another price rise this year, as if two already weren\u2019t bad enough.</p> <p>So far just Bulb, the UK\u2019s fastest-growing energy supplier, has warned of the risk of a third rise, but many others will be considering similar action. Wholesale electricity and gas prices <a href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/data-portal/supplier-cost-index-fuel-type-gb\">have marched upwards</a>. Culprits include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/17/what-are-the-factors-driving-up-the-price-of-crude-oil\">higher oil prices</a>, Europe\u2019s heatwave ramping up electricity use, and some power output falling, plus the need to replace depleted gas reserves after a cold winter.</p> <p>Ministers say the subsequent tariff increases by energy suppliers are <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/08/10/energy-companies-should-tell-customers-much-profit-make-bills/\">\u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d</a> and justify the government\u2019s imminent price cap. They urge people to switch.</p> <p>What they don\u2019t mention is most people are virtually guaranteed to see their energy bills climb even higher, despite the cap and regardless of whether they switch. As Ed Miliband has noted repeatedly, a price cap is not the same as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/25/ed-miliband-energy-price-freeze\">his price freeze</a>. The cap is reviewed twice a year by Ofgem and, if costs facing suppliers are up, up goes the cap. The regulator <a href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/ofgem-increases-level-safeguard-tariff-due-higher-wholesale-costs\">did exactly that recently with its specialist \u201csafeguard\u201d tariff</a>.</p> <p>In the short term, wholesale costs look to be heading in one direction. The US imposition of sanctions against countries that import Iranian crude from November could drive up oil, and therefore gas, prices.</p> <p>The reality is that no single government, let alone an individual, has control over wholesale prices. Consumers with the money can protect themselves from rising energy bills with energy efficiency measures, solar panels and, increasingly, home batteries. Nationally, the only long-term solution is to speed up the switch from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy.</p> <p>That transition won\u2019t come cheap. But as the rising wholesale prices and energy bills remind us, neither does the alternative.</p>",
