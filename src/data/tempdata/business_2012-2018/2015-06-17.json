      "bodyText": "PS: Greece has, once again, made the front pages of several newspapers: That\u2019s it for us for tonight, I think, after another busy day. Here\u2019s a taster of tonight\u2019s news story, rounding up events: Greece has put the onus on its creditors to prevent it being forced out of the single currency, warning that an economic collapse on a par with the Great Depression of the 1930s had left it broke and unable to pay its debts. Athens announced on Wednesday that it had run out of money, and would not be able to pay \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.15bn) owed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at the end of this month, on the eve of a meeting of eurozone finance ministers. The meeting is seen as the last realistic chance of striking a deal before Greece\u2019s current bailout runs out in 12 days\u2019 time. The warning came as the governor of the Greek central bank said that Greece was on the brink of an \u201cuncontrollable crisis\u201d and warned that leaving the eurozone would also mean \u201cexit \u2026 most likely from the European Union\u201d. But the chances of a breakthrough on Thursday\u2019s talks, in an increasingly hostile negotiating environment, were seen as remote. Greece\u2019s Eurogroup partners have said it would be up to Greece to offer concessions at the meeting, but they think it unlikely that Athens will cross any of its \u201cred lines\u201d despite its desperate financial plight. \u201cThings will not be so lengthy,\u201d said one official in Brussels. \u201cThe ball, ministers will conclude, is very firmly in the Greek camp. I honestly believe this will be pretty short.\u201d Greek shares fell sharply for a fourth successive day as the UK government said it was making contingency arrangements to minimise the impact on the economy from a default, which the head of the European parliament said would result in Greece having to leave the European Union, not just the single currency. More here: I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning to pick up the action again, as eurozone finance ministers head to Luxembourg for that Eurogroup meeting. Goodnight, and thanks for ALL those comments. GW A couple more photos from tonight\u2019s anti-austerity, pro-government protest in Athens: The head of the US Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, has warned that there will be disruptions in the financial markets, and the global economy, if Greece doesn\u2019t reach a deal with its creditors. Yellen said (via fastFT) This is a very difficult situation. In the event there is not an agreement, I do see the potential for disruption that could affect the European outlook and global financial markets. There would undoubtedly be spillovers to the US that would affect our outlook as well. She was speaking at a press conference tonight, after the Fed left interest rates unchanged but downgraded its growth forecasts for the US economy. Our friends at Reuters have more details: ASKED ON GREECE, FED\u2019S YELLEN SAYS UNFORTUNATELY GREECE, CREDITORS FACED WITH DIFFICULT DECISIONS FED\u2019S YELLEN SAYS MY HOPE IS THEY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIND SOLUTION ASKED ON GREECE, FED\u2019S YELLEN SAYS IN EVENT THERE IS NOT AGREEMENT, SEE POTENTIAL FOR DISRUPTIONS ASKED ON GREECE, FED\u2019S YELLEN SAYS U.S. HAS VERY LIMITED DIRECT EXPOSURE FED\u2019S YELLEN SAYS IF NO AGREEMENT IN GREECE, GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD BE AFFECTED ASKED ON GREECE, FED\u2019S YELLEN SAYS IF THERE ARE IMPACTS ON EUROPEAN ECONOMY, WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE SPILLOVERS The Speaker of the Greek parliament is at tonight\u2019s rally, hours after tangling with Bank of Greece governor Stournaras over his warning that Greece could crash out of the EU without a deal. There are plenty of schoolteachers at tonight\u2019s demonstration, who have told Helena they believe the government should toughen its stance. Our correspondent Helena Smith is in Syntagma Square. She says the turnout at tonight\u2019s rally isn\u2019t great, and several of the demonstrators have told her they believe Greece should \u2018rupture\u2019 away from the European Union. A glance at the posters and banners on display tonight in Athens show there is still support for Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government in its battle to get an \u2018honourable compromise\u2019: As if the Greek crisis wasn\u2019t dramatic enough, the spotlight will shift to Russia on Friday when Alexis Tsipras visits St Petersburg. He\u2019ll meet with president Vladimir Putin, on the sidelines of an economic summit. And there is speculation that Moscow could potentially offer Athens a credit line, as my colleague Shaun Walker reports: \u201cA financial deal package to Greece is definitely possible, but it\u2019s unlikely to come as a straight bailout loan, and more likely to be packaged as part of an advance payment deal over gas transfer or something similar,\u201d said Chris Weafer, a Moscow-based financial analyst. The two leaders will discuss Greek participation in a major pipeline project that would bring Russian gas to Europe through Turkey and Greece, bypassing Ukraine \u2013 a long-term Russian strategic aim.... Here\u2019s Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis telling reporters in Paris that \u201cit is our moral duty to reach an agreement very, very quickly\u201d. As we posted earlier, he doesn\u2019t expect a deal tomorrow -- but the eurogroup meeting could \u201cset the scene\u201d for further discussions. The Daily Telegraph\u2019s Merheen Khan is at Syntagma Square, and reports that there is a pretty decent atmosphere despite the crisis gripping Greece. Sorry, that banner\u2019s hung outside the Greek parliament, not actually on it (as a reader across the square kindly reports): Demonstrators have hung a banner outside the Greek parliament, urging people to support Greece at this crucial time and help end austerity in the country. Expectations for Thursday\u2019s eurogroup meeting were not high, but they\u2019ve been given another shunt by Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis: Crowds are gathering in Syntagma Square, outside the Greek parliament, for tonight\u2019s anti-austerity rally: There\u2019s talk that a senior US department of state official, Amanda Sloat, will visit the Greek capital on Thursday to push for an agreement. And signs the demonstrations are beginning: Over in Athens the governing Syriza party has issued a thinly veiled attack on the governor of the Bank of Greece saying he has gone beyond the boundaries of his constitutional role by warning that the country is on the brink of \u201cuncontrollable crisis.\u201d Helena Smith writes: Following House president Zoe Konstantopoulou\u2019s criticism of Yannis Stournaras, Syriza has also released a statement saying the Bank Governor had not only breached his constitutional role but actively attempted to limit the room the government had for maneuver in its negotiations with creditors. \u201cWith his report today the governor of the Bank of Greece not only exceeded the boundaries of his institutional role, he is attempting to contribute to the creation of an asphyxiating framework in the moves and negotiating abilities of the Greek government,\u201d said the statement. \u201cAnd it is worth asking why this is happening when it is presumed that the role of the Bank of Greece is maintaining the stability of the banking system.\u201d Stournaras, who served as finance minister under the previous conservative-led \u201cpro bailout\u201d government, warned that failure to meet a deal would \u201cmark the beginning of a painful course that would lead initially to a Greek default and ultimately to the country\u2019s exit from the euro area and \u2013 most likely \u2013 from the European Union\u201d. More detail on those comments from the US. Reuters reports: A senior U.S. State Department official on Wednesday repeated warnings from Washington that Greece had to make a \u201cserious move\u201d to break a deadlock with its international creditors. Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Amanda Sloat met Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Euclid Tsakalotos and reaffirmed recent messages from President Barack Obama and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, a statement from the U.S. embassy in Athens said. It said she underscored \u201cthe urgency of Greece making a serious move to reach a pragmatic compromise with its creditors\u201d and noted that \u201cfailure to reach an agreement would create immediate hardship for Greece and broad uncertainties for Europe and the global economy.\u201d The US continues to show its concern over the (lack of) progress in Greece\u2019s standoff with its creditors: 17-Jun-2015 17:30:47 - SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL TOLD GREEK GOVT IN ATHENS URGENT NEED TO REACH PRAGMATIC COMPROMISE WITH CREDITORS 17-Jun-2015 17:31:27 - U.S. OFFICIAL WARNED GREEK GOVT THAT FAILURE TO REACH DEAL WOULD BRING HARDSHIP TO GREECE, BROAD UNCERTAINTY FOR GLOBAL ECONOMY (Snaps courtesy Reuters) And because it\u2019s always good to have a quick reminder of where things stand: European shares lost some of their early calm, notably after Greece warned it could not make the \u20ac1.6bn IMF payment due at the end of the month without agreeing a deal with its creditors. Investors were also nervous ahead of the latest news on a possible US interest rate rise from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. After the markets closed the ECB reportedly lifted its emergency liquidity assistance level to \u20ac84.1bn for Greek banks. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 29.55 points or 0.44% to 6680.55 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.6% to 10,978.01 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.02% lower at 4790.62 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 0.71% to 22,225.06 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.53% at 10,813.4 The Athens market was down 3.15 % at 680.88 And after an opening rise, Wall Street has slipped back, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now 16 points or 0.09% lower. After comments from ECB board members yesterday that Greek banks were solvent - a prerequisite for the emergency liquidity assistance - it seemed likely the central bank would continue its support. But it made us wait for the news ...... Here\u2019s the ECB liquidity news we\u2019ve been awaiting: More from Tsakalotos (courtesy Reuters): [He] suggested Athens be offered debt relief in the form of having the European bailout fund - known as the European Stability Mechanism - take over Greek bonds held by the ECB - as one option that would not increase debt for Greece or its partners. \u201cThere are lots of technical solutions on how that could be done,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is goodwill, I can think of 10-15 solutions right now of how that could be done. If there\u2019s no political goodwill then for any solution I can think of a drawback.\u201d Asked how confident he was that a deal could be reached, Tsakalotos said: \u201cI think that question is mostly for European partners now.\u201d He said it was up to Europe to show it is willing to \u201clearn from its mistakes\u201d and whether it was willing to accept a government that is not in the mainstream. Greece\u2019s top negotiator has confirmed the country does not have the cash to make the \u20ac1.6bn payment due to the International Monetary Fund at the end of the month without a new deal. And any deal looks as far away as ever, given the opposing positions held by the country and its creditors. In an interview with Reuters, Euclid Tsakalotos said there was no money to pay the IMF at the moment and echoed prime minister Alexis Tsipras by saying the government was willing to make concessions but pension cuts could not be on the agenda: \u201cAt the moment we haven\u2019t got the money,\u201d he said, adding that Athens was already \u201csqueezing every last bit of drop of liquidity\u201d to service debt so far. \u201cThere is no financing, we haven\u2019t got access to the markets, we haven\u2019t got money that hasn\u2019t been paid since the summer of 2014 so obviously we won\u2019t be able to have the money to pay that [the \u20ac1.6bn to the IMF].\u201d Keeping up Athens\u2019 rhetoric against what it calls unreasonable demands by lenders, he attacked European and IMF lenders for failing to give ground and seeking the bulk of concessions from Athens. \u201c(Negotiations are) a give and take process, not a convergence on the other side\u2019s initial position,\u201d Tsakalotos said. \u201cThey\u2019ve moved a bit on fiscal targets but in most areas, you would be hard pressed to put an A4 paper between what they said in February and what they now say in June. So that seems a bit odd.\u201d In particular, he ruled out any further cuts to pensions, a stance repeatedly stressed by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose radical leftist party stormed to power this year on a pledge to end austerity and raise living standards in Greece. \u201cPension reform is not a red line for us,\u201d said Tsakalotos. \u201cIt seems to us utterly reasonable that pension cuts should not be on the agenda; pension reform should be on the agenda.\u201d He added that any concessions had to be \u201ceconomically viable\u201d: Athens could accept a deal only if it was sustainable and addressed debt, financing and investment issues, said Tsakalotos. \u201cIf you have that, then the Greek government will sign the deal,\u201d Tsakalotos said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t have that kind of deal there is no point in signing onto something that you know is going to fail.\u201d The comments by Tsakalotos - who took a prominent role in the talks with European and IMF lenders in April after finance minister Yanis Varoufakis was sidelined - come amid growing fears that cash-strapped Greece is on track to a default at the end of the month that paves the way for a euro exit. Are the Greek prime minister\u2019 negotiating skills perhaps paying off? The leader has been the butt of rare praise \u2026 in no other than the German Die Welt. And it has not been lost on the Greek media, reports Helena Smith. The posturing, foot-dragging and sheer brinkmanship that the Greek government has displayed may not be the work of \u201chot-heads\u201d but two very level-headed men who may well be Europe\u2019s most successful politicians. So says, Germany\u2019s leading newspaper Die Welt of the Greek leader Alexis Tsipras and his finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. The paper writes that the Greek duo are deliberately drawing out the process so that Tsipras can eventually arrive at the higher-level \u201cpolitical solution\u201d he so publicly wants. The paper says the two men may have pulled off the feat of deconstructing the German psyche. \u201cThey are soberly observing the fear that is eroding German souls and drawing their conclusions. What we have been continuously reading in recent months, that Tsipras and Varoufakis have been pushed in a corner, is wrong. Right now, they are probably the most successful politicians in Europe.\u201d That is not, of course, how many in Tsipras\u2019 own Syriza party see things (Varoufakis intriguingly has never become a member). Earlier today I spoke to Stathis Kouvelakis, the London University professor, who accused Syriza of retreating to the point where it was now on the brink of suffering a mighty defeat. Speaking from Paris, Kouvelakis predicted that the \u201cSyriza project\u201d would endure a huge existential crisis if it agreed to apply the reform proposals it had made to creditors. \u201cEither Tsipras commits political suicide and accepts these measures, or he says the big \u2018no\u2019. What is sure is that after five months of so-called negotiations the outcome is worse than the starting-point which is absolutely absurd. The government waited five months, when its coffers were empty and its position extremely weakened, to delay payments to the IMF,\u201d said Kouvelakis who sits on Syriza\u2019s central committee. \u201cIt should have done that earlier, just as it should have made clear to lenders that if they don\u2019t change their attitudes, there are alternative solutions.\u201d The Greek stock market has fallen sharply again today, unsurprisingly given the apparent slow march the country is making towards default: Of course the timing of any capital controls in Greece could not be worse, with the summer pretty much here... And more pressure on Greece to bow to its creditors demands, this time from German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his Italian counterpart Paolo Gentiloni: 17-Jun-2015 15:08:46 - GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER STEINMEIER -WANTS TO KEEP GREECE IN THE EURO ZONE, BUT GREECE MUST MAKE ITS CONTRIBUTION 17-Jun-2015 15:09:58 - GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER STEINMEIER -SEES NO GREECE AGREEMENT WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT FROM ATHENS 17-Jun-2015 15:11:13 - GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER STEINMEIER -TIME IS RUNNING OUT AS GREECE DOESN\u2019T PLAN ON PRESENTING NEW PROPOSALS ON THURSDAY 17-Jun-2015 15:12:12 - ITALIAN FOREIGN MINISTER GENTILONI - GREECE MUST PARTICIPATE IN SEARCH FOR A COMPROMISE (Snaps courtesy Reuters) Just how short could Thursday\u2019s short talks on Greece at the Eurogroup meeting be? As the prospect of a Greek default and/or exit from the eurozone comes closer, there is more talk of what to do if a Grexit does happen. British Chambers of Commerce director general John Longworth looked at the possible effect on the UK: With a messy Grexit looking increasingly likely, many UK businesses may be hit by the resulting market upheaval, changes in trade flows, and payment issues. Central banks and governments must work to limit the disruption to business through all means possible. As with every crisis, we need to be hard-headed enough to see if there is an opportunity in the agony. It is possible that Grexit may produce a silver lining for the UK as it seeks to redefine its position in Europe. In the aftermath of Grexit, the eurozone would have to hold an honest debate about further integration and its future operation to prevent something similar ever happening again. Within those discussions there would be an opportunity for the UK to secure meaningful changes and opt-outs that ensure a reformed EU aids our competitiveness. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister has tweeted that there is still time for a \u201cmiracle\u201d: Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, who will attend tomorrow\u2019s eurogroup meeting of finance chiefs, also urged the Greek government to rein in its fiery language. (Yesterday, the Greek prime minister said lenders were trying to humiliate his country) Time for a recap, for the benefit of any new readers joining us. The Greek central bank has raised the stakes in the battle with its lenders, warning that the country could be plunged into an unprecedented slump unless a deal is agreed soon. In a new report, the Bank of Greece warned that the country\u2019s membership of the European Union, as well as the eurozone currency bloc, is now at stake. It said: Failure to reach an agreement would....mark the beginning of a painful course that would lead initially to a Greek default and ultimately to the country\u2019s exit from the euro area and \u2013 most likely \u2013 from the European Union. A manageable debt crisis, as the one that we are currently addressing with the help of our partners, would snowball into an uncontrollable crisis, with great risks for the banking system and financial stability. An exit from the euro would only compound the already adverse environment, as the ensuing acute exchange rate crisis would send inflation soaring. And the impact on the Greek people would be desperately severe, the Bank added. All this would imply deep recession, a dramatic decline in income levels, an exponential rise in unemployment and a collapse of all that the Greek economy has achieved over the years of its EU, and especially its euro area, membership. From its position as a core member of Europe, Greece would see itself relegated to the rank of a poor country in the European South. The warning came as Britain began taking new steps to protect itself from the consequences of Greece defaulting. Prime minister David Cameron\u2019s spokeswoman told journalists in the House of Commons that: We don\u2019t go into the specifics of these plans but of course they will be looking at how do we make sure we have looked at the impacts on business, the banks and the financial sector and tourists.... This is about making sure we are as prepared as we can be. Of course, the potential default does present some serious economic risks, so alongside contingency plans it is about making sure we have an economy that is growing and that our public finances are in good order.\u201d Greece\u2019s bailout programme runs out in two weeks time, when it must also repay \u20ac1.6bn to the International Monetary Fund. Without an agreement, it\u2019s not clear that this bill can be paid. Despite growing fears of a default, Greece\u2019s prime minister remains defiant today -- having accused the IMF of \u201ccriminal\u201d responsibility for the damage caused to his country. Alexis Tsipras told a press conference that: \u201cWe have only one option and that is to find a solution that will be accepted and passed by the government and the parliament..... If we do not have an honourable compromise, we will once again say the big no.\u201d Tsipras also insisted that Greek pensions cannot be cut further, as creditors have asked. There are reports in Athens today that European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker could discuss a new proposal with Tsipras tonight, ahead of a vital meeting of eurozone finance ministers tomorrow (at the Eurogroup). EU insiders, though, have dampened hopes of a breakthrough at Thursday\u2019s Eurogroup. Discussions could be brief, officials said. As I type, the European Central Bank is considering whether to keep providing liquidity to the Greek banking sector. It has already given \u20ac82bn to allow Greek banks to keep operating. A decision is expected later today..... And European stock markets are mostly in the red, again, as Greek fears worry investors again. Over in Athens reports are coming in that EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker is poised to propose a new compromise, in a bid to end the stalemate between Greece and its lenders. Helena Smith writes: The new proposal is expected to be sent to Athens in the coming hours with well-placed sources not ruling out the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras having telephone contact with Juncker this evening. Newsit is reporting that creditors will offer the olive branch of cuts being made in defence expenditure to help cover the fiscal gap this year - estimated at \u20ac2bn by the EU and IMF and \u20ac1.5bn by Greece. The cuts would amount to \u20ac250m. But the quid pro quo would be the government overhauling the social security system - and completing axing early retirement schemes. The proposals would, the Guardian believes, be part of an interim cash-for-reform agreement that would tide the country over the summer. The Bank of Greece\u2019s warning about the perils of not reaching a deal has caused a political flap in the Greek parliament. Parliamentary speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou has dismissed the Bank\u2019s hard-hitting report as \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d, and returned it to BoG governor Yiannis Stournaras. Stournaras was finance minister in the previous coalition government led by the right-wing New Democracy party, which enforced many of the austerity measures which Syriza has vowed to overturn. As such, there is no love lost with the Syriza-led government, given their views are almost diametrically opposite. Some MPs are now demanding that Stournaras explain himself to parliament, flags up journalist Sophia Ignatidou. An unusual sight these days, given the independence that central banks enjoy, points out Channel 4\u2019s Paul Mason. Far left elements inside the Syriza party are now calling on Greeks to take en masse to the streets, giving Alexis Tsipras another headache. From Athens, Helena Smith reports. More and more MPs on Syriza\u2019s far left are saying that even if an agreement is reached it will never be enforced. \u201cThe proposals made by lenders can only be passed with tanks and if the lenders want to pass them they have to find the tanks,\u201d Stathis Leoutsakos, a prominent Syriza party member told the local radio station Parapolitika 90,2 this morning. \u201cI don\u2019t mean tanks in the classic sense of the word. Today tanks have been replaced by a communications game that they play in great skill in the euro zone.\u201d It was wrong to say that Greece and its creditors had reached total impasse, he said adding that the cost of throwing the debt-choked country out of the currency bloc would be much higher than keeping it in. \u201cI don\u2019t believe [euro exit] would be a catastrophe. Despite the difficulties our country would have acquiring a new national currency, it could be a way out.\u201d Ratcheting up the rhetoric, Syriza\u2019s Far Left Platform called on people to take to the streets in protest. Mass demonstrations in towns around Greece are being lined up for this evening. Christos Kasimis wrote on the Left Platform\u2019s website ISKRA: \u201cIt is clear that after five months of so called negotiations, creditors are clearly trying to impose a destructive agreement on the Greek people.\u201d Back in Athens, Alexis Tsipras warned that he would give Europe the \u201cbig no\u201d if an acceptable deal cannot be reached. Speaking at today\u2019s press conference with Austrian chancellor Werner Faymann, the Greek PM said: \u201cWe have only one option and that is to find a solution that will be accepted and passed by the government and the parliament..... If we do not have an honourable compromise, we will once again say the big no.\u201d Tsipras added that he\u2019s thanked Faymann for his words of support this morning. The German government has reiterated that it doesn\u2019t want Greece to leave the eurozone. But a spokesman has also warned that it will be hard to reach a deal at tomorrow\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, as Athens has not tables any new proposals: Reuters has snapped the details: GERMAN GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SAYS UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE LITTLE NEW TO REPORT ON GREECE GERMAN GOV\u2019T SPOKESMAN REPEATS ASSERTION THAT GERMANY WANTS TO DO EVERYTHING TO KEEP GREECE IN THE EURO ZONE GERMAN FINANCE MINISTRY SPOKESMAN SAYS IT\u2019S OUR GOAL TO MAKE PROGRESS ON GREECE AT THE EUROGROUP MEETING ON THURSDAY GERMAN FINANCE MINISTRY SPOKESMAN SAYS HOWEVER ONE SHOULDN\u2019T EXPECT THE EURO ZONE FINANCE MINISTERS TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE ON DOCUMENTS ON THURSDAY Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, has told the Guardian that Greece could end up out of the European Union. Speaking to our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, Schulz said others took different views but: \u201cI think that leaving the euro is also leaving the European Union\u201d. All EU countries have to commit to the euro except the UK and Denmark, due to the opt-outs negotiated in the Maastricht Treaty. There\u2019s no legal avenue in treaties for leaving the euro, Schulz said, adding: \u2018Legally it\u2019s unclear.\u2019 That squares with the Bank of Greece\u2019s warning this morning that, without a bailout agreement, Greece could be forced down a \u201cpainful course\u201d resulting in its exit from both the eurozone and the EU. Back at the Athens press conference, Alexis Tsipras has said he\u2019s not planning to ask voters for a fresh mandate - implying no early elections or a referendum. He also vows to take responsibility if an \u201chonourable compromise\u201d is reached (ie, if it doesn\u2019t live up to the pledges he made before winning January\u2019s general election) My colleague Rowena Mason has just emailed from Parliament, with details of Britain\u2019s plans to protect itself against the Greek crisis. The prime minister\u2019s official spokeswoman said contingency planning was looking at the potential impact on businesses, banks, the financial sector and tourism, among other areas. She said: \u201cThe chancellor was talking in the House yesterday about the potential exit of Greece and how that presents serious economic risks and of course as part of that we take all steps to protect ourselves from such eventualities... You will expect we are continuing to make sure we have the right plans in place and stepping up operations given where discussions have got to. We don\u2019t go into the specifics of these plans but of course they will be looking at how do we make sure we have looked at the impacts on business, the banks and the financial sector and tourists.... This is about making sure we are as prepared as we can be. Of course, the potential default does present some serious economic risks, so alongside contingency plans it is about making sure we have an economy that is growing and that our public finances are in good order.\u201d Asked whether the contingency plans covered just British exposure to Greece or the risk of wider contagion, she said: \u201cYou would expect us to have plans in place that look at a range of potential consequences.\u201d She said she was not aware of any change in the Foreign Office advice for people travelling to or living in Greece. Heads-up. Greece\u2019s prime minister is criticising the demands made by the country\u2019s creditors, at a press conference with the Austrian chancellor right now. Tsipras is insisting that Greece\u2019s latest proposals met the creditors demands*. He says he doesn\u2019t understand the \u2018obsession\u2019 with finding more pension cuts, on top of the reductions made since austerity began. Further cuts are not possible, he says. * - on that point. Greece did present a plan on Sunday that hit the budget surplus targets demanded by the Institutions (IMF/ECB/EC). However, the Commission was not convinced that the measures were plausible. David Cameron\u2019s spokeswoman has just announced that Britain is \u201cstepping up\u201d its preparations in case Greece leaves the eurozone. Speaking a few moments ago, she said the UK government believes there would be a \u201cserious economic risk\u201d from a Greek default. 11:20:43 - BRITAIN \u2018STEPPING UP\u2019 PREPARATIONS FOR POSSIBLE GREEK EXIT FROM EURO ZONE - SPOKESWOMAN FOR PM DAVID CAMERON* 11:20:45 - BRITISH GOVERNMENT BELIEVES A GREEK DEFAULT WOULD BE A SERIOUS ECONOMIC RISK - SPOKESWOMAN FOR PM DAVID CAMERON This confirms what Nick Watt reported this morning, that the UK is taking \u201call steps\u201d to protect Britain. The Bank of Greece\u2019s dire warning that the country could crash out of the EU unless it reaches an agreement sent a ripple though the Athens stock market. The AGT index dropped another 5 points, or 1%, to 698 points, having been up in early trading. That appears to be its lowest level since September 2012 Brussels reporters have been told that Cyprus\u2019s bailout crisis of spring 2013 shows that capital controls can be imposed in the euro area: SENIOR EU OFFICIAL: CYPRUS SHOWS EURO ZONE CAN IMPLEMENT CAPITAL CONTROLS, BUT THEY ARE VERY UNDESIRABLE As you may recall, Cyprus\u2019s banks were shut for several days after its government accepted a \u20ac10.7bn eurozone bailout. Caps were imposed on how much money could be taken out of banks, or out of the country, and savers with over \u20ac100,000 in the banks suffered a hefty haircut on their deposits. Werner Faymann\u2019s \u2018solidarity visit\u2019 to Greece hasn\u2019t gone down terribly well in Brussels: The chancellor of Austria has now arrived at the Greek PM\u2019s residence, Maximos Mansion, for talks with Alexis Tsipras. Werner Faymann has already repeated his call for Europe to support Greece, saying: \u201cFor Europe to be stronger, it must show solidarity and support to any country which needs it.\u201d That follows Faymann\u2019s warning this morning that Greece\u2019s creditors are making some unacceptable demands on the country\u2019s people: EU officials are also telling reporters in Brussels that they have already made serious concessions to Greece, since agreeing a four-month bailout extension in February. That implies they\u2019re not willing to make further compromises to reach a deal. The head of the eurozone\u2019s finance ministers has declared that there is still time for an agreement to be reached, to avert the alarming scenario painted by Bank of Greece today. Jeroen Dijsselbloem told reporters at the Dutch parliament that: \u201cTime is running out but a deal is still possible\u201d. Dijsselbloem will chair tomorrow\u2019s Eurogroup meeting, where finance chiefs from across the single currency bloc will discuss the crisis. The Brussels press pack are being briefed now, and hearing that the discussion on Greece could be rather brief. Greece\u2019s central bank has issued an urgent plea to both sides to hammer out a deal, warning that the country could be forced out of the European Union. In a new report to the Greek parliament, the Bank of Greece said an agreement was now a \u201chistoric imperative\u201d. Otherwise, the country risks being relegated to just \u201ca poor country in the European South\u201d. It\u2019s a chilling warning of the risks that Greece currently faces. The Bank says: Failure to reach an agreement would....mark the beginning of a painful course that would lead initially to a Greek default and ultimately to the country\u2019s exit from the euro area and \u2013 most likely \u2013 from the European Union. A manageable debt crisis, as the one that we are currently addressing with the help of our partners, would snowball into an uncontrollable crisis, with great risks for the banking system and financial stability. An exit from the euro would only compound the already adverse environment, as the ensuing acute exchange rate crisis would send inflation soaring. And the impact on the Greek people would be desperately severe: All this would imply deep recession, a dramatic decline in income levels, an exponential rise in unemployment and a collapse of all that the Greek economy has achieved over the years of its EU, and especially its euro area, membership. From its position as a core member of Europe, Greece would see itself relegated to the rank of a poor country in the European South. For that reason, the Bank said, the risk of a \u201ccredit event\u201d (ie, a default), must be removed \u201conce and for all\u201d. It also reported that around \u20ac30bn has already left Greek bank accounts since October, as the \u201cdragging-on of negotiations\u201d hit confidence. That has: ...largely taken the form of cash withdrawals and hoarding, while flight of capital has also been recorded. And if all that wasn\u2019t bad enough, the Bank also predicted that the current recession will probably get even worse: The deterioration of economic sentiment indicators and financing conditions in the private sector suggest that the slowdown of the economy is likely to accelerate in the second quarter of 2015, putting the economy at risk for a renewed bout of recession. The British government has embarked on contingency planning to prepare for the \u201cserious economic risks\u201d posed by a Greek default and a possible exit from the euro, the chancellor, George Osborne, has confirmed. My colleague Nick Watt reports: As David Cameron prepares to discuss the Greek crisis with the prime ministers of Italy and Luxembourg on Wednesday, the chancellor said the UK government was taking \u201call steps\u201d to protect Britain. Whitehall officials, who held contingency planning meetings on the implications of a possible Greek exit from the euro in February, have stepped up their preparations in recent weeks amid fears that Greece could be on the verge of a debt default... Full story: My colleague Jon Henley is in Athens, and found plenty of evidence that Greeks have been stashing funds away in case their banking sector collapses: He writes: \u201cEverybody\u2019s doing it,\u201d said Joanna Christofosaki, in front of a Eurobank cash dispenser in the leafy Athens neighbourhood of Kolonaki. \u201cOur friends have all done it. Nobody wants their money to be worthless tomorrow. Nobody wants to be unable to get at it.\u201d A researcher in the archaeology department at the Academy of Athens, Christofosaki said she knew plenty of people who had \u201c\u20ac10,000 somewhere at home\u201d and plenty of others who chose to keep their stash at the office. Was she among them? \u201cIf I was, I certainly wouldn\u2019t tell you.\u201d \u201cPeople are very concerned,\u201d said the owner of a small company who asked not to be named. \u201cI think those who could, have already transferred some money abroad. And lots of others have taken out a few thousand, enough to see them through any immediate crisis. I have.\u201d Sofia, who runs a boutique in one of Athens\u2019 wealthier suburbs, said she and her husband had \u20ac15,000 in a safe in the garage, \u201cjust to be sure we\u2019re not caught out.\u201d Elsewhere, an anonymous car concessionaire confessed to \u201cgetting into gold a little bit\u201d. \u201cNot much. But it\u2019s safe, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what they say.\u201d Here\u2019s Jon\u2019s full report: Austria\u2019s finance minister Hans J\u00f6rg Schelling may not be as supportive towards Greece as chancellor Faymann, suggests our Europe editor Ian Traynor. Two months ago, Schelling said he was \u201csomewhat irritated\u201d by Greece\u2019s failure to submit acceptable reforms. He could be positively exasperated by now. Freelance journalist Omaira Gill reports that the Greek people are feeling increasingly worried by the crisis: Over in Athens, demonstrators have occupied the offices of the European Commission in an anti-austerity protest. Enikos has more details: The demonstrators are members of the trade union affiliated to Syriza, called META. They have raised a banner saying: \u201cThe people cannot be blackmailed \u2013 The country isn\u2019t for sale\u201d. Europe should be able to handle the \u201ccontagion risk\u201d if Greece were to default on its debts and crash out of the eurozone. That\u2019s according to Moritz Kraemer, managing director of sovereign ratings at S&amp;P. Speaking on Bloomberg TV this morning, Kraemer said that most investors don\u2019t think that \u201cGrexit\u201d is a likely scenario. But, if they are wrong, Greece is relatively well insulated from the rest of the financial world: If you really look at the contagion risks - the direct links through common creditors, it\u2019s not really that important any more. Europe also has \u201cmuch more powerful firewalls\u201d than in 2012 - including a new bailout facility (the ESM) and Mario Draghi\u2019s new bond-buying vehicle (OMT). There is really a much bigger, more powerful toolbox than last time. That\u2019s all true....but it\u2019s worth noting that eurozone government bond yields (or interest rates) have been rising in recent weeks. That suggests they are being seen as riskier.... Kraemer also confirmed that Greece would not be in default if missed its \u20ac1.6bn repayment to the IMF on 30 June. Here\u2019s a couple more key quotes from the Austrian chancellor this morning, ahead of his meeting with Alexis Tsipras at noon local time (10am BST): Europe\u2019s stock markets are creeping higher this morning, as traders watch events in Greece nervously. The FTSE 100 has gained 20 points, or 0.3%, in the first few minutes of trading, having been driven to a four-month low earlier this week. The German and Spanish markets are also up just 0.2%, while the euro is a little higher against the US dollar at $1.127. So, no panic. But the Greek saga is still hitting sentiment in the City. As Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets puts it: The nation\u2019s fate is perilously in the balance as failure by Greece and its Creditors to cede ground continues, and a mud-slinging blame game by all and sundry for the lack of progress gathers pace. The clock ticks ever closer to default. The Austrian Chancellor has issued a strong declaration of solidarity with Greece, hours before meeting Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras in Athens later today. Werner Faymann told Austrian broadcaster ORF that Greece should be given more support, given the extent of the damage suffered by its people since the debt crisis began. Faymann criticised some of the measures which Greece\u2019s lenders - the IMF, ECB and EC - are demanding, saying: \u201cI know there were a number of proposals, also from the institutions, that I also don\u2019t find in order.\u201d \u201cHigh joblessness, 30-40 percent (with) no health insurance and then raising VAT on medicines. People in this difficult situation cannot understand that.\u201d Relations between Greece and her creditors are increasingly fraught, as Athens resists pressure to cut its pensions bill by 1% of GDP, and to raise sales taxes. Last night, EC president Jean-Claude Juncker accused the Greek government of misleading the public over exactly what is being demanded. Faymann\u2019s intervention, and his visit to Greece today, are a last-ditch attempt to end the standoff with international creditors before eurozone finance ministers meet tomorrow. He declared: \u201cI stand on the side of the Greek people who in this difficult position are being proposed more things detrimental to society.\u201d Faymann did also emphasise that Greece must meet its commitments under its current bailout plan, citing the need to fight fraud and a fair taxation system where everyone pays their fair share. But the priority is to \u201cavoid a catastrophe\u201d. And asked whether Greece\u2019s leaders can deliver a compromise in time, he said: \u201cI assume that someone who is elected lives up to his responsibility.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek bailout crisis. Athens now has just 13 days to reach a deal with its creditors before its bailout programme expires, and a matter of hours until finance ministers meet to discuss the situation in Luxembourg on Thursday. The prospects of a deal to end the deadlock that is spreading worry through the eurozone and beyond do not look great. With both sides deadlocked, Austrian chancellor Werner Faymann is heading to Athens this morning for talks with prime minister Alexis Tsipras at noon local time, followed by statements to the press. Faymann will be pushing Tsipras to reach a deal, to head off the growing risks that Greece fails to repay \u20ac1.6bn to the IMF on 30 June. That danger prompted US Treasury secretary Jack Lew to phone Tsipras last night and push for a \u201cpragmatic compromise\u201d, just hours after the Greek PM accused the IMF of \u201ccriminal responsibility\u201d for the crisis. The unfolding crisis piles more pressure on the European Central Bank, which must decide today whether to keep providing emergency liquidity to the Greek banking sector. The ECB has already stumped up around \u20ac82bn of support, to help banks keep afloat despite the steady loss of deposits as alarmed savers withdraw their funds. The ECB is unlikely to pull the plug on ELA today; such a move would be far too political for the central bank at this stage in the crisis. It could agree to raise it by a few billion euros -- a big increase would suggest that the outflow of deposits has accelerated. We\u2019ll be watching out for comments from Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who is meeting the Secretary-General of the OECD, Angel Gurria, in Paris this afternoon. And two of most powerful figures in world finance, IMF chief Christine Lagarde and Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, will both be speaking tonight; might they say something about the Greek crisis? I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

So says, Germany\u2019s leading newspaper Die Welt of the Greek leader Alexis Tsipras and his finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. The paper writes that the Greek duo are deliberately drawing out the process so that Tsipras can eventually arrive at the higher-level \u201cpolitical solution\u201d he so publicly wants. The paper says the two men may have pulled off the feat of deconstructing the German psyche. \u201cThey are soberly observing the fear that is eroding German souls and drawing their conclusions.

The industry should accept this and move on,\u201d said Horta-Os\u00f3rio. That ought to be a statement of the bleedin\u2019 obvious. The ringfencing rules became law in 2013 and must be implemented by 2019. But the grumblers keep grumbling, seemingly hoping that parliament might change its mind and that a Conservative government might overturn a manifesto commitment. Ringfencing is part of HSBC\u2019s unhappiness with life in the UK while John McFarlane, new chairman of Barclays, wonders whether all the \u201cstatutory and regulatory changes are really necessary\u201d. Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s speech should serve as a useful corrective. First, he argued that ringfencing should be seen as part of a package of measures to protect taxpayers in the next crisis. Second, he suggested that, in time, the banks might gain via lower capital requirements. HSBC and Barclays will probably ignore him. But the former, in particular, would be wise to change its tune. On the bank levy, HSBC has a reasonable argument that taxing worldwide assets, rather than just UK assets, is unfair and should be reviewed. But it\u2019s hard to get a hearing if your approach is to whinge about everything under the sun, even laws that entered the statute book two years ago and were backed by two banking commissions. A good bet They\u2019ll be kicking themselves at CVC. If the private equity house had put another quid on its 975p-a-share takeover offer two years ago, it would probably have won. It would have been a smart piece of business. These days Betfair trades at \u00a324 and even bears, who choke on a valuation of 30 times earnings, reckon \u00a321 would be roughly right. CVC might have mis-managed Betfair, of course, but it seems unlikely. Run sensibly, Betfair throws off cash. In any case, chief executive Breon Corcoran, newly arrived at the time, had already plotted a self-help strategy that all sides agreed was correct. In short, don\u2019t experiment in countries where you can be legislated out of existence overnight; concentrate instead on regulated markets; and remember that Betfair is a gambling company with its roots in sport. The fruits of the keep-it-simple approach have been rich. Revenues last year rose by a fifth and operating profits improved 53% to \u00a394.3m. The UK\u2019s new point-of-consumption betting tax was merely an inconvenience, rather the source of Ladbrokes-style anguish. Despite a 70% hike in the dividend, Betfair was the biggest faller in the mid-cap index yesterday on these full-year figures. The rich valuation was one reason. The other was disappointment that Corcoran didn\u2019t repeat last year\u2019s \u00a3200m return of cash to shareholders. That reaction seems churlish. Yes, Betfair could afford to hand over more of its winnings since it is still sitting on net cash of \u00a3105m. But acquisitions \u2013 which, presumably, is what Corcoran means when he emphasises the importance of scale \u2013 could make Betfair a more interesting proposition yet.

Here\u2019s an eye-catching example of sharpshooting from Waitrose: give the customers 20% off ten items of their choice. It\u2019s not quite that simple, it should be said. You have to choose your products in advance from a list of 950 and you have stick with your selections for a fixed period. And you have to have a loyalty card. None of those conditions seem overly onerous, however. This scheme will come at a cost to Waitrose, of course. It reckons \u00a3260m over the course of a year, and it\u2019s not saying how much can be shoved onto suppliers. But Clive Black of Shore Capital is right: Waitrose has recognised that shoppers don\u2019t trust most supermarket promotion and think they are being led a merry dance. A pick-your-own approach is different. He\u2019s also correct that the big boys, despite bragging about how much valuable data they collect from their Clubcard and Nectar cards, barely bother with personalised offers.

      "bodyText": "Young couples are delaying getting married because they are finding it so hard to get a mortgage to buy their first home, Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, warned on Wednesday as she once more signaled a historic rise in interest rates later this year. Yellen said people were finding it so hard to secure credit from banks that \u201cpeople [are] delaying marriage [because they] can\u2019t get mortgages as easily\u201d. She said that it is still too difficult for people to get a mortgage unless they have \u201cpristine\u201d credit scores. The difficulties many face securing mortgages has caused the US home ownership rate to hit its lowest level since 1989, according to Commerce Department data. The seasonally adjusted homeownership rate dropped to 63.8% in the first quarter of 2015, compared to 65% in 2014 and 69.2% in 2005. Young people are suffering the worst, with with ownership rates down 7.3% over the past decade for people aged 18-34. Yellen also said she is also contacted \u201ceveryday\u201d by retirees, who complain that they are \u201creally suffering from rates [as] they hoped [higher interest rates] would boost their retirement income\u201d. Yellen\u2019s comments came as the Federal Reserve said it was sticking with its target of raising interest rates before the end of the year \u2013 which would be the first rate rise since the 2008 financial crisis. The Federal Open Market Committee said the US economy has been \u201cexpanding moderately\u201d and the \u201cpace of job gains picked up while the unemployment rate held steady\u201d. \u201cNo decision has been made about when the right timing is for an increase,\u201d Yellen said in a press conference in Washington. \u201cCertainly an increase this year is possible, we could certainly see data that would justify that.\u201d But she warned the market not to get too hung up about when exactly the rate rise will come, saying it could be \u201cSeptember, or December or March\u201d. Following a contraction in the first quarter, the committee said the economy is on track to grow 1.8%-2% this year. The policymakers, who have been meeting in Washington, said interest rates would be kept at near-zero for now, but would be increased if the economy continues to improve and unemployment decreases. Fed chair Janet Yellen has said she expects the Fed to raise rates in 2015. Analysts expect the hike to come in September. \u201cThe committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2% over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipate,\u201d the policymakers said in a statement. \u201cThe pace of job gains picked up while the unemployment rate remained steady. On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources diminished somewhat.\u201d Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG, said: \u201cThe Fed statement reads a bit more optimistically regarding the economy. Things are \u2018expanding moderately\u2019 after the first quarter\u2019s poor performance which is now thought to be \u2018little changed\u2019 rather than contracting. \u201cIf one believes, as we do, that the Fed is getting set to hike later this year, the Fed\u2019s dot plot plays right into that thesis. The statement does use \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201cmoderately\u201d three separate times, reinforcing the Fed\u2019s hesitancy and nervousness about the outlook. But we think they want to raise rates and the projections support that idea.",

      "bodyText": "Telecoms giant AT&amp;T has been fined a record $100m for misleading consumers about the carrier\u2019s \u201cunlimited data\u201d plans, plans that in fact capped data and slowed speeds by up to 90% after users topped 5GB of data in a month. \u201cConsumers deserve to get what they pay for,\u201d said FCC chairman Tom Wheeler. \u201cBroadband providers must be upfront and transparent about the services they provide. The FCC will not stand idly by while consumers are deceived by misleading marketing materials and insufficient disclosure.\u201d \u201cFor years, AT&amp;T sold and charged customers for unlimited data plans without revealing that if customers used more than a fixed amount of data, their internet speeds would be reduced so much that basic applications became unusable,\u201d said a senior Federal Communications Commission (FCC) official. The FCC served AT&amp;T its notice of apparent liability (NAL) today, and it has 30 days to respond. AT&amp;T did not return an email requesting comment. AT&amp;T \u201cused the misleading and inaccurate term \u2018unlimited\u2019\u201d in reference to existing unlimited use plans that, in 2011, were quietly and unilaterally changed by the company to incorporate a \u201cmaximum bit rate\u201d data speed cap. Most damningly, the official said, \u201cAT&amp;T conducted focus group studies in 2009 and 2010 that demonstrated that customers had a negative reaction to the policy.\u201d This is the second investigation of AT&amp;T by a federal regulator on the same activity; the Federal Trade Commission charged AT&amp;T with misconduct for its \u201cunlimited\u201d plans last year, just a few weeks after Verizon hastily reevaluated its own plans to throttle unlimited subscriber speeds. AT&amp;T\u2019s action, said the official, \u201ccaused intentional, repeated, and caused substantial harm to AT&amp;T\u2019s customers and the marketplace\u201d and the FCC wanted to levy a fine that \u201cwould not simply be the cost of doing business.\u201d The official pointed out the AT&amp;T had made billions off the capped \u201cunlimited\u201d accounts over the years. A notable voice of dissent in the action was FCC commissioner Ajit Pai, a reliably conservative voice on the commission. His statement of dissent was headed with a quote from Kafka\u2019s The Trial; \u201c[I]t is an essential part of the justice dispensed here that you should be condemned not only in innocence but also in ignorance.\u201d Pai wrote: \u201cA government \u2018rule\u2019 suddenly revised, yet retroactive. Inconvenient facts ignored. A business practice sanctioned after years of implied approval. A penalty conjured from the executioner\u2019s imagination. These and more Kafkaesque badges adorn this Notice of Apparent Liability (NAL), in which the Federal Communications Commission seeks to impose a $100 million fine against AT&amp;T for failing to comply with the apparently opaque \u2018transparency\u2019 rule the FCC adopted in its 2010 Net Neutrality Order.\u201d It is possible the fine will be reduced after further negotiation with AT&amp;T: \u201cWe are always open to settling any enforcement investigation or action,\u201d the official said. Last year and the year prior, the FCC fined four top cellular services - T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Verizon and Sprint - for \u201ccramming\u201d extra charges onto bills in a systematic fashion. All four carriers have some kind of data throttling policy, though levels of transparency vary.

      "bodyText": "Walmart hid $76bn of assets in tax havens across the world, including $64.2bn managed by 22 different subsidiaries in Luxembourg, where Walmart has no stores, according to a study published on Wednesday. The study, published by campaign group Americans for Tax Fairness and funded by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, alleged that Walmart has \u201ckept its tax haven subsidiaries secretive by burying mention of their existence\u201d. Walmart denied the claims. The authors claimed Walmart\u2019s global empire keeps billions of dollars of assets away from the prying eyes of the taxman via a network of shell companies in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and a host of Caribbean countries known for their low taxes. According to the report, since 2011 Walmart has transferred ownership of its stores in Brazil, Japan, Puerto Rico and South Africa to Luxembourg. It claims that Walmart\u2019s Luxembourg operations paid less than 1% in tax on profits of more than $1.3bn between 2010 and 2013. A spokesman for Walmart, denied that the company passed its overseas profits through Luxembourg in order to avoid tax. The spokesman, Randy Hargrove, told the Guardian that Walmart used its Luxembourg office to manage its affairs because \u201cmany banks are headquartered there, and the people are well educated\u201d. He also said Luxembourg had a favourable time zone for managing its international affairs. There is a seven-hour time difference between Luxembourg and Tokyo. Hargrove dismissed the overall report as \u201cincomplete, erroneous information designed to mislead readers\u201d. He said the report\u2019s finding that Walmart placed $64.2bn assets under control of Luxembourg-registered companies was \u201cwrong\u201d but was unable to provide a correct figure. In a statement he said: \u201cThis is the same union-supported group that regularly issues similar, flawed reports on Walmart to promote their agenda rather than the facts. This latest report includes incomplete, erroneous information designed to mislead readers. \u201cWalmart paid $6.2 billion in US federal corporate income tax last year, nearly 2% of all corporate income tax collected by the US treasury. Walmart also pays over $10bn in payroll taxes for its 1.3m US associates. In addition, Walmart paid $3.3bn in property tax, state income tax, franchise tax and other state taxes.\u201d He said Walmart has \u201cprocesses in place to comply with applicable SEC and IRS rules, as well as the tax laws of each country where we operate.\u201d The report said that Walmart\u2019s 592 British stores are owned via Broadstreet European Holdings Co-operative in the Netherlands and Azure Holdings Sarl in Luxembourg. It makes Walmart the latest in a string of multinational companies, including Pepsi and Ikea, to be exposed for exploiting international tax loopholes via Luxembourg. Walmart, which is majority-owned by the Walton Family (who are said to be worth a combined $175bn), made $27.4bn profit before tax last year. Nancy Reynolds, a cashier at a Walmart store in Merritt Island, Florida, said: \u201cWalmart\u2019s tax havens are making one of the richest families in the world even richer while Walmart workers continue to struggle to get by on poverty-level wages. It\u2019s time for Walmart and the billionaire Waltons to pay their fair share \u2013 both by implementing a $15/hour minimum wage in the US, and committing to pay their fair share of taxes all around the world.\u201d Alke Boessiger of global union UNI said: \u201cWe have known for a long time that Walmart\u2019s low-road business model keeps many of its own workers in poverty and encourages abuses throughout the company\u2019s global supply chain. Now we know that Walmart\u2019s low-road business model includes the extensive use of tax havens to avoid paying its fair share of taxes all over the world.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Alexis Tsipras will travel to Russia again on Friday to meet Vladimir Putin as questions swirl over whether Moscow could extend credit lines to bail out the Greek prime minister\u2019s embattled economy. Tsipras heads to Russia as fears grow that a Greek exit from both the eurozone and the European Union could be inevitable. The governor of Greece\u2019s central bank, Yannis Stournaras, warned on Wednesday that his country was on the brink of an \u201cuncontrollable crisis\u201d and that failure to reach a deal would \u201clead initially to a Greek default and ultimately to the country\u2019s exit from the euro area and \u2013 most likely \u2013 from the European Union\u201d. Tsipras will meet Putin on the sidelines of a major economic forum in St Petersburg. The Greek prime minister has been an outspoken critic of EU sanctions against Russia and is seen as one of the Kremlin\u2019s few friends inside the European bloc. Nevertheless, sources in Brussels told news agencies on Wednesday that all 28 EU nations had agreed to roll over sanctions against Russia, which are due for renewal at a meeting on Monday. Tsipras has criticised the sanctions on numerous occasions, and during a visit to Moscow in April hoped to secure an exemption for Greek produce from Russia\u2019s counter-sanctions, which ban the import of fruit, vegetables and cheese from EU countries, and which have hit Greek farmers hard. On that occasion, Tsipras left Moscow with little except warm words of friendship, and analysts say it is unlikely that Putin will have much to offer immediately during this week\u2019s visit. \u201cA financial deal package to Greece is definitely possible, but it\u2019s unlikely to come as a straight bailout loan, and more likely to be packaged as part of an advance payment deal over gas transfer or something similar,\u201d said Chris Weafer, a Moscow-based financial analyst. The two leaders will discuss Greek participation in a major pipeline project that would bring Russian gas to Europe through Turkey and Greece, bypassing Ukraine \u2013 a long-term Russian strategic aim. Another possible outcome is that a newly founded development bank for the Brics countries \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013 could ask Greece to join. Athens would pay a token amount to join the new bank and could then receive loans and funding for infrastructure projects. Tsipras has said he will \u201cseriously consider\u201d Russia\u2019s invitation to join the bank, which was clearly made with political rather than economic motives in mind. The Greek energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis, told agencies last week: \u201cWe secured decisive Russian support for Greece\u2019s request for participation in the new development bank of Brics countries.\u201d But the other Brics nations, which are due to meet at a summit in the Russian city of Ufa next month, may not agree to take Greece on, and analysts say Russia is unlikely to risk such a confrontational move in the immediate future. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect Russia or the Brics bank to offer Greece loans right now; this would be seen as an aggressive move and would be likely to harden attitudes in Brussels and Berlin even further,\u201d said Weafer. Weafer said similar discussions had occurred over possible Russian bailouts of Iceland and Cyprus during financial crises but had come to little. \u201cIf help does come, it is likely to be after Greece has settled its issues, one way or the other, with the EU,\u201d he said. Russia\u2019s economy, and its rouble currency, have been hard hit by a combination of falling oil prices and western sanctions over Ukraine, and while things have improved since December, Moscow was still not in a position to be throwing money around, said Weafer. \u201cThe bottom line is that while access to international debt markets is still restricted, there just isn\u2019t billions of dollars around to use for bailing out foreign countries while it may still be required to pay all the bills at home.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Waitrose launches 'pick your own offers' scheme for loyal shoppers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Waitrose has launched a new salvo in the UK\u2019s supermarket price war by giving loyalty card shoppers 20% off their 10 favourite items on every shop. The \u201cpick your own offers\u201d scheme allows shoppers to choose the items on which they\u2019ll get a discount from a list of 950 possibilities. The cost of the price cuts could add up to \u00a3260m a year or more, although Waitrose will split that cost with suppliers who have signed up. \u201cI think what this is going to do is give customers real trust that they are getting a real discount on what they want to buy,\u201d said Mark Price, chief executive of the upmarket grocer. He said the scheme was designed to retain and reward loyal customers and persuade them to shop more often and buy more items. He said Waitrose would not be reducing the number of other promotional offers available in its stores. \u201cThis is about making sure our customers are really well looked after,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be very, very expensive for us but we think giving power to the customer on 1,000 lines to start with is the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThis really is ground-breaking \u2026 There is a question over time whether this changes the market in the UK and around the world.\u201d The scheme certainly seemed to get off to a popular start with shoppers. The MyWaitrose section of the supermarket\u2019s website crashed for about half an hour on Wednesday as a wave of shoppers responded to a promotional email. Industry insiders said Waitrose, which saw profits dive last year, was casting about for ways to boost sales as its growth has slowed dramatically in recent months. One said the scheme would only hand discounts to already loyal shoppers. Like all the major supermarkets, Waitrose\u2019s profits have fallen as it has been forced to cut prices and improve service in order to fight off tough competition from fast-growing discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Waitrose has gained market share by outperforming its bigger peers such as Tesco and Asda. Price said a recent slowdown in sales growth was largely because Waitrose had been heavily promoting its online services a year ago and offering more discount vouchers to loyalty card customers. He said the major grocers had now cut their prices on fresh produce to a level which was on a par with the discounters, and deflation in the market was likely to ease off by the autumn. \u201cI think the heavy lifting on bringing the market in line with the discounters is to a large extent done, and on top of that there will be an easing on commodity prices,\u201d he said. Price said the PYO scheme would pay off financially if it encouraged shoppers to spend more, in the same way the MyWaitrose loyalty scheme has done. MyWaitrose offers shoppers a free coffee and, if they spend \u00a35 on weekdays, a free newspaper. There are now 5.8 million members signed up, with 100,000 more joining every week. While some industry watchers have expressed fears about the costs of the scheme to Waitrose, Price insists it has helped the retailer outperform its rivals by tempting shoppers back more regularly. The PYO scheme will launch next week. Shoppers who want to participate must sign up for a MyWaitrose loyalty card and then pick the items they want discounted online. They will have to stick with those choices for an initial period of three months, but will get a discount on every shop during that period \u2013 whether they go into a store or buy online. At present about half the list of 950 items are branded and half Waitrose\u2019s own-label \u2013 mainly fresh produce. Rupert Ellwood, Waitrose marketing director, said the scheme was likely to be tweaked based on customers\u2019 feedback. The scheme has been in development since January and tested at 20 stores in the Yorkshire area for the past six weeks. Toilet roll was the item most frequently chosen for a discount by shoppers in the trial but eggs, tomatoes and bacon were also popular.",

      "body": "<p>Waitrose has launched a new salvo in the UK\u2019s supermarket price war by giving loyalty card shoppers 20% off their 10 favourite items on every shop.</p> <p>The \u201cpick your own offers\u201d scheme allows shoppers to choose the items on which they\u2019ll get a discount from a list of 950 possibilities. The cost of the price cuts could add up to \u00a3260m a year or more, although Waitrose will split that cost with suppliers who have signed up.</p> <p>\u201cI think what this is going to do is give customers real trust that they are getting a real discount on what they want to buy,\u201d said Mark Price, chief executive of the upmarket grocer. He said the scheme was designed to retain and reward loyal customers and persuade them to shop more often and buy more items. </p> <p>He said Waitrose would not be reducing the number of other promotional offers available in its stores. \u201cThis is about making sure our customers are really well looked after,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be very, very expensive for us but we think giving power to the customer on 1,000 lines to start with is the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThis really is ground-breaking \u2026 There is a question over time whether this changes the market in the UK and around the world.\u201d</p> <p>The scheme certainly seemed to get off to a popular start with shoppers. The MyWaitrose section of the supermarket\u2019s website crashed for about half an hour on Wednesday as a wave of shoppers responded to a promotional email.</p> <p>Industry insiders said Waitrose, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/12/john-lewis-cuts-staff-bonus-to-lowest-level-for-12-years\">which saw profits dive last year</a>, was casting about for ways to boost sales as its growth has slowed dramatically in recent months. One said the scheme would only hand discounts to already loyal shoppers.</p> <p>Like all the major supermarkets, Waitrose\u2019s profits have fallen as it has been forced to cut prices and improve service in order to fight off tough competition from fast-growing discounters such as Aldi and Lidl.<br></p> <p>Waitrose has gained market share by outperforming its bigger peers such as Tesco and Asda. Price said a recent slowdown in sales growth was largely because Waitrose had been heavily promoting its online services a year ago and offering more discount vouchers to loyalty card customers.</p> <p>He said the major grocers had now cut their prices on fresh produce to a level which was on a par with the discounters, and deflation in the market was likely to ease off by the autumn.</p> <p>\u201cI think the heavy lifting on bringing the market in line with the discounters is to a large extent done, and on top of that there will be an easing on commodity prices,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Price said the PYO scheme would pay off financially if it encouraged shoppers to spend more, in the same way the MyWaitrose loyalty scheme has done.</p> <p>MyWaitrose offers shoppers a free coffee and, if they spend \u00a35 on weekdays, a free newspaper. There are now 5.8 million members signed up, with 100,000 more joining every week. While some industry watchers have expressed fears about the costs of the scheme to Waitrose, Price insists it has helped the retailer outperform its rivals by tempting shoppers back more regularly.</p> <p>The PYO scheme will launch next week. Shoppers who want to participate must sign up for a MyWaitrose loyalty card and then pick the items they want discounted online. They will have to stick with those choices for an initial period of three months, but will get a discount on every shop during that period \u2013 whether they go into a store or buy online.</p> <p>At present about half the list of 950 items are branded and half Waitrose\u2019s own-label \u2013 mainly fresh produce. Rupert Ellwood, Waitrose marketing director, said the scheme was likely to be tweaked based on customers\u2019 feedback.</p> <p>The scheme has been in development since January and tested at 20 stores in the Yorkshire area for the past six weeks. Toilet roll was the item most frequently chosen for a discount by shoppers in the trial but eggs, tomatoes and bacon were also popular.<br></p>",

    "webTitle": "OECD: large banking sectors widen inequality and slow growth", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Countries with bigger banking sectors suffer weaker growth and worse inequality, according to a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). After analysing 50 years of data across its 34 member-countries, economists at the Paris-based thinktank have found that having a large financial sector can slow economic growth, while its highly paid workers exacerbate social inequality. The report said: \u201cThere can be too much finance. When the financial sector is well developed, as has been the case in OECD economies for some time, further increases in its size usually slow long-term growth.\u201d Adair Turner, the former chair of the Financial Services Authority, gave a memorable critique of the UK financial services industry in the wake of the credit crisis when he said that some of the activities carried out by the City\u2019s finance firms were \u201csocially useless\u201d. The OECD analysis, launched in a speech by its chief economist, Catherine L Mann, in London on Wednesday, discovered that large banking sectors, underpinned by the expectation of being bailed out by their governments, tend to lend too much. In particular, they pump excessive credit to households, inflating unsustainable bubbles in housing and other assets, but do not invest enough in viable and growing companies, which are better at creating growth. At the same time, the tendency for firms to finance themselves by issuing debt, which is tax-deductible, instead of equity, can lead to riskier investments. Mann also highlighted the fact that the bumper rewards available in the financial sector suck in \u201ctoo many talented people\u201d, who could be doing something else. Together, these factors lead to a misallocation of capital, which bears down on growth, the OECD found. Since those at the low end of the earnings scale tend to receive less credit, and hold fewer shares and other assets than those at the top, these bubbles disproportionately benefit the rich, widening the wealth gap between top and bottom. The existence of a large group of highly paid staff in finance is in itself a source of inequality too. The OECD found that while finance workers are 4% of the workforce, they make up 20% of the top 1% of earners. The OECD found that even the lowest paid finance workers earn 15% more than their counterparts doing similar jobs in other sectors. At the top of the scale, the gap is as wide as 40%. Mann called for a series of reforms including limits on household credit, tackling the too-big-to-fail banks, removing the tax subsidy for debt financing and limiting bankers\u2019 bonuses to make the finance sector more beneficial to society at large. She said the efforts at financial reform that have taken place since the crisis have not yet tackled the problem and called on governments to ask themselves: \u201cWhat are the policies that we have in place right now, that pushed us in the wrong direction \u2013 too much credit to the wrong places?\u201d She said London\u2019s large financial sector was not necessarily too big, but the City should be doing a number of thing differently, including finding ways of allowing less wealthy individuals to invest in shares. \u201cIt\u2019s about the composition of the City,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a set of policies that would preserve the City as a precious part of the UK economy, but it would be more equitable and more pro-growth.\u201d Echoing recent remarks by International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde, Mann called for the structure of financial sector pay to be changed, including by lengthening the period over which bonuses can be clawed back. \u201cThese are financial guys: they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re incentivised to do. Let\u2019s give them an incentive to do something different.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Sajid Javid overruled top official's Royal Mail share warning", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The business secretary, Sajid Javid, has overruled a warning from his most senior department official that giving Royal Mail shares to staff as part of its selloff would not represent value for money. The government sold half its 30% stake in the postal service for \u00a3750m last week, at 500p a share \u2013 a considerable premium to the 330p float price. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) also handed another 1% of shares \u2013 worth \u00a350m \u2013 to Royal Mail staff, on top of the 10% they were awarded as part of the 2013 flotation. Martin Donnelly, permanent secretary at BIS, took the unusual step of seeking a letter of direction from Javid, and questioned whether the share handout was in taxpayers\u2019 interests. Donnelly wrote: \u201cThe Royal Mail is a key part of the UK\u2019s infrastructure. Its efficient operation is critical to the economy and that, in turn, requires the full engagement of its workforce, including through necessary restructuring for the company to remain competitive. I have considered whether it is possible to construct a business case that the impact of the employee shareholdings on the company\u2019s performance justifies the taxpayer\u2019s expenditure involved. I am not aware of sufficient evidence to reach that conclusion. \u201cAgainst this basis, I conclude that while a decision to allocate more shares to Royal Mail staff up to a limit of a further 1% and on the same terms as previously is an entirely legitimate policy decision, it does not provide a tangible return to the taxpayer and so is not value for money as defined in the legislation.\u201d Responding to Donnelly\u2019s letter, Javid overruled his objections and formally directed him to implement the policy. He wrote: \u201cI have noted your concerns about the value for money of doing so. However, in coming to this decision I have taken into account the wider benefits of this policy. Employees currently comprise an important part of Royal Mail\u2019s shareholder base. \u201cFurthermore, I believe there is merit in rewarding the employees of Royal Mail for their hard work, which has contributed to the recent performance of the company and has been reflected in the current share price.\u201d Research published by the Institute for Government thinktank, using Treasury figures, last year found there were relatively few instances of ministers formally overruling departmental secretary advice \u2013 50 between 1990 and 2013. Meanwhile, the Wealth Management Association, which manages \u00a3650bn of the UK\u2019s wealth, said retail investors should have been included in the latest Royal Mail selloff. Andy Thompson, of the WMA, said: \u201cIn general, the retail investor community can provide much-needed liquidity and offer loyalty to companies they invest in. The government needs people that make responsible investments and look to the long-term future. \u201cLet us hope that when the time comes to sell off RBS government assets, retail investors will be offered the same opportunities as big institutions.\u201d The government plans to sell \u00a332bn of its RBS assets in coming months.",

    "webTitle": "UK wage growth hits four-year high of 2.7% in April", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wage growth in Britain hit a four-year high of 2.7% in April, according to official figures, delivering a welcome increase to household finances following the fall in inflation this year. But some analysts warned that the jump in real wages, the highest for seven years, would be short-lived if inflation continued to rise over the rest of the year and productivity remained flat. The Office for National Statistics said average wages increased from 2.3% in March and 0.7% in April last year to record the strongest rate of growth since August 2011. CPI inflation fell 0.1% in April, the first time that the cost of living had turned negative. Inflation was 1.8% in the same month last year. Unemployment fell by 43,000 to 1.81 million, down 349,000 on a year earlier. The jobless rate stood at 5.5% in the three months to April. The employment minister, Priti Patel, said the figures illustrated how Britain was becoming a more prosperous nation, especially after the rise in the three months to April was fuelled by an increase in full-time work. \u201cThe UK\u2019s employment rate has seen the largest rise of any G7 economy over the last year,\u201d she said. Service sector pay rose at an annual rate of 2.9%, the highest since early 2009, while financial services pay was up 3.6%. Construction pay growth rose to a post-crisis high of 4.0%. But John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, said real wage growth would start to run out of steam in the autumn because the combination of low inflation, bumper pay packets and flat productivity was unsustainable. \u201cWith price inflation at some point set to rise back toward 2%, a continuation of real wage growth at the current rate will have to be earned by a return to a more normal rate of productivity growth; if not there will eventually be renewed upward pressure on prices and, ultimately, interest rates. \u201cIn recent months UK workers have benefited from an economy merely mimicking a strong underlying recovery. We should enjoy this while we can. But a genuine sustained recovery will need to be based on higher productivity.\u201d His downbeat forecast was supported by figures showing manufacturing sector pay growth lagged behind at 1.0%. A less than glowing assessment by households of their personal outlook for the year also showed that under the surface, consumers remain reluctant to accept government assurances that 2015 ranks as a golden age of employment. The Markit household finance index fell from 45.5 in May to 43.8 this month. Concerns about job security was a key factor weighing on households, with the index respondents personal prospects posting at a 15-month low. Markit said a rebound in economic growth from a lacklustre first three months of the year coupled with strong wage rises would put pressure on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) to raise interest rates. The likelihood of a rate rise by next spring at the latest was heightened by MPC member Kristin Forbes, who said in a speech in London that inflation would soon recover from its negative rate in March of -0.1 to near its 2% target. She said analysis suggests \u201cinflation appears to be on track to rebound toward target by early 2016\u201d, irrespective of low inflation in Britain\u2019s trading partners.",

CPI inflation fell 0.1% in April, the first time that the cost of living had turned negative.

The jobless rate stood at 5.5% in the three months to April.</p> <p>The employment minister, Priti Patel, said the figures illustrated how Britain was becoming a more prosperous nation, especially after the rise in the three months to April was fuelled by an increase in full-time work. \u201cThe UK\u2019s employment rate has seen the largest rise of any G7 economy over the last year,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Service sector pay rose at an annual rate of 2.9%, the highest since early 2009, while financial services pay was up 3.6%. Construction pay growth rose to a post-crisis high of 4.0%. </p> <p>But John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, said real wage growth would start to run out of steam in the autumn because the combination of low inflation, bumper pay packets and flat productivity was unsustainable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/jun/17/enjoy-rising-wages-slow-things-down\">Enjoy rising wages while they last \u2013 it won't take much to slow things down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWith price inflation at some point set to rise back toward 2%, a continuation of real wage growth at the current rate will have to be earned by a return to a more normal rate of productivity growth; if not there will eventually be renewed upward pressure on prices and, ultimately, interest rates. </p> <p>\u201cIn recent months UK workers have benefited from an economy merely mimicking a strong underlying recovery. We should enjoy this while we can. But a genuine sustained recovery will need to be based on higher productivity.\u201d</p> <p>His downbeat forecast was supported by figures showing manufacturing sector pay growth lagged behind at 1.0%. A less than glowing assessment by households of their personal outlook for the year also showed that under the surface, consumers remain reluctant to accept government assurances that 2015 ranks as a golden age of employment. The Markit household finance index fell from 45.5 in May to 43.8 this month.</p> <p>Concerns about job security was a key factor weighing on households, with the index respondents personal prospects posting at a 15-month low. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Markit said a rebound in economic growth from a lacklustre first three months of the year coupled with strong wage rises would put pressure on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) to raise interest rates. The likelihood of a rate rise by next spring at the latest was heightened by MPC member Kristin Forbes, who said in a speech in London that inflation would soon recover from its negative rate in March of -0.1 to near its 2% target.</p> <p> She said analysis suggests \u201cinflation appears to be on track to rebound toward target by early 2016\u201d, irrespective of low inflation in Britain\u2019s trading partners.</p> <p><br><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "China and Australia have signed a trade agreement that is set to increase market access for Australian beef and wine exporters while boosting Chinese carmakers and electronics producers who wish to sell their goods to Australians. But as ministers from both countries promoted the benefits for industries and consumers, the Australian Labor party and the Greens vowed to scrutinise the yet-to-be-released details to ensure it was a good deal. One flashpoint is the inclusion of an investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) clause, which grants foreign companies the right to sue governments for breaching commitments in such agreements. The Australian union movement has also raised concerns about the access to be granted to Chinese citizens under labour market provisions. Both governments concluded negotiations on the free trade agreement (FTA) in 2014, but it was formally signed in Canberra on Wednesday by Australia\u2019s trade minister, Andrew Robb, and China\u2019s commerce minister, Gao Hucheng. Gao said it was a \u201ccomprehensive, high-quality and balanced agreement\u201d that was a milestone in relations between Australia and China. \u201cIt is the highest degree of liberalisation of all the FTAs China has so far signed with any economy,\u201d he said. The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, said the agreement would give each nation \u201cunprecedented access to each other\u2019s markets\u201d and pointed to the reduction in tariffs imposed on trade. \u201cIt removes barriers to Australian agricultural exports across a range of products, including beef, dairy, lamb, wine, horticulture and seafood,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means duty-free entry for 99.9% of our resources, energy and manufacturing exports within four years. But it\u2019s about so much more than just exporting more and reducing tariffs. Australian services providers, financial, education, health and aged care will have new access to China\u2019s services sector, a sector that is already the largest contributor to China\u2019s GDP and is set to drive economic growth in coming years. \u201cFor China, this agreement liberalises the screening threshold for Chinese private sector investment in Australia and it puts Chinese businesses in the same position as those of our other major trading partners. And of course it means that Australian consumers will pay less for cars, for clothes, for electronics and other goods imported from China.\u201d The full text of the agreement will be subject to an inquiry by parliament\u2019s joint standing committee on treaties, paving the way for parliament to consider amendments to relevant legislation. Labor\u2019s Senate leader and trade spokeswoman, Penny Wong, said the party would assess the deal against the test of whether it would increase jobs and economic growth. Labor would look closely at the effect on the Australian labour market. \u201cLabor supports temporary skilled migration to fix skill shortages. That scheme should never be used as a mechanism to bypass local workers and we will certainly be looking at the detail of that,\u201d Wong said. \u201cAnd, as I\u2019ve said previously, Labor does not support investor-state dispute settlement clauses in agreements.\u201d The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said: \u201cRegardless of the supposed marginal economic benefits, the Greens will never support an agreement that makes future governments liable to be sued by foreign corporations simply for making laws that protect the public interest.\u201d The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) raised concerns that the deal would \u201cmake it much easier for employers to bring in Chinese workers without having to advertise jobs to local workers\u201d. The ACTU\u2019s president, Ged Kearney, said the government appeared \u201cintent on selling out even more local jobs\u201d. \u201cThere must be strong rules around labour market testing and labour mobility clauses in the China free trade deal to ensure local jobs are protected,\u201d she said. The Electrical Trades Union went further, describing the FTA as \u201can irreversibly reckless move\u201d. But the Business Council of Australia\u2019s president, Catherine Livingstone, said the agreement would unlock significant opportunities for two-way trade and \u201cdeliver lasting benefits for the whole community\u201d. The Australian Industry Group\u2019s chief executive, Innes Willox, said industry had long viewed the agreement with Australia\u2019s largest trading partner \u201cwith a mixture of optimism and trepidation\u201d. \u201cAs with all trade agreements, the process would have benefited from deeper consultation and a better understanding of the opportunities and the threats before signing,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "From the street, the Foxtons in Brixton in south London, like the estate agent\u2019s other 55 branches, is almost all glass. Two great floor-to-ceiling windows, separated by a slender pillar, reveal a trademark Foxtons interior, unlike those of other estate agents: all pale, smooth surfaces, very bright lighting and very little furniture. There is a reception desk, a fridge of drinks for customers, a few clusters of modular white tables and chairs of the kind you might find in a loft apartment that was not quite as cool as it thought it was, and a couple of low display cases containing photos of two dozen properties for sale and for let. An unremarkable one-bedroom flat in a plain street nearby is offered at \u201c\u00a3346.15 per week, \u00a32,077 deposit + \u00a3420 (inc VAT) admin fee*\u201d. The advertisement does not explain the asterisk. The Brixton Foxtons has been open for two years, glowing like an alien spacecraft, seven days a week and deep into the evenings, among the takeaways and bus stops and bargain clothes shops of Brixton Road. Parts of this area have been gentrifying for decades, but during the branch\u2019s first month, someone scrawled \u201cYuck\u201d on its windows. During the second, someone painted \u201cYuppies Out!\u201d In April 2013, after a street party nearby to celebrate the death of Margaret Thatcher, someone threw red paint all over the facade. Later the same month, Foxtons temporarily hired security guards to prevent demonstrators campaigning against high rents and letting fees from entering the branch. The Brixton anti-Foxtons campaign has continued to escalate regardless. In July 2013, protesters managed to get into the branch and unfurl a \u201cYuppies Out\u201d banner. This April, the branch was briefly occupied again by demonstrators holding placards that read \u201cSocial Housing Not Social Cleansing\u201d. A few weeks later, during a generally peaceful anti-gentrification march on 25 April, half the frontage of Foxtons was smashed in. Six days later, there were still bits of glass on the pavement and the window was boarded up. But the branch was open for business. Young men in dark suits, with crisp white shirts and disciplined haircuts \u2013 \u201cproperty negotiators\u201d in Foxtons jargon \u2013 strode impatiently in and out, upright as young army officers, swinging their company car keys, working on buyers on their company phones. Inside, behind the spotless white reception desk, a young woman in heels and heavy makeup \u2013 the \u201coffice co-ordinator\u201d \u2013 was waiting, as usual, to greet customers. At one of the equally spotless white tables, a nervous-looking client, a casually dressed man of about 30, was writing a list of properties on a pad of paper, as a negotiator watched from the chair opposite. In a short side street immediately round the corner, there were two fresh Foxtons for sale signs. As Chris Millington, a property business analyst at Numis Securities, told me: \u201cFoxtons do very well down in Brixton.\u201d * * * By common consent, London is one of the most frenzied and important property markets in the world: according to the Land Registry, it accounts for nearly half the value of all residential sales in England and Wales. But even in the intensely competitive field of London estate agency, Foxtons has acquired a unique, double-edged reputation: for relentlessness and innovation; for brashness and aggression; for bending \u2013 and sometimes breaking \u2013 the profession\u2019s infamously loose rules; for doing almost anything to get a letting or a sale. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough firm,\u201d its founder Jon Hunt told the Daily Mail in 2009. (Hunt declined to be interviewed for this article.) Two years before, on the eve of the last property crash, he had sold his stake in the business for a reported \u00a3390m. Foxtons is not a huge company. Its share of the London residential market is estimated at between 10 and 20%. It currently has about 1,300 staff \u2013 the number expands and contracts as abruptly as the housing market itself. Its branches are outnumbered by those of rival networks: the national estate agency group Countrywide has 1,400 outposts. Foxtons operates solely in London and the Surrey towns of Woking and Guildford. Its branches cover about half the capital, including the centre, the most prosperous parts of west London, fashionable inner suburbs such as Hackney and Walthamstow, and more quietly rising outer ones such as Enfield. Each time Foxtons moves into a new area, and its logo of acid yellow and patrician green suddenly appears on \u201cfor sale\u201d signs, on letters to local homeowners, on flashy new Foxtons premises, and on the loudly branded Minis the company provides for its negotiators, the character and status of that place seems to alter. There can be unease, even anger but there can also be a less publicly expressed excitement. As Ivor Dickinson, until recently managing director of one of Foxtons\u2019 competitors, Douglas and Gordon, put it: \u201cIf you have a name as a really ruthless, sharky bastard estate agent, a lot of people, when they come to selling their house, will think, \u2018I want that ruthless, sharky bastard.\u2019\u201d The swaggering success of Foxtons is partly a product of the double standards many of us have about property: complaining and worrying about the cost of it, while wanting to make as much as possible from it ourselves. The company is also a reflection of the modern British economy: short-term in its priorities, sometimes vibrant, London-dominated, property-skewed, socially divisive. The estate agent\u2019s fortunes have become symbolic. Last month, the day the Conservative general election victory was announced, and with it the demise of Labour\u2019s plans to increase taxes on properties worth more than \u00a32m, it was widely noted by despairing leftwingers, as well as excited business reporters, that the Foxtons share price had leapt 12%. Since David Cameron became prime minister in 2010, Foxtons has almost doubled its number of branches, and more than trebled its annual profits, to \u00a342m. When Foxtons became a public company in 2013, it was initially valued at \u00a3650m; within six months, demand for its shares had swelled that value to \u00a31.1bn. Investors like Foxtons partly because it plays the property game two ways. As well as helping to drive the upward price spiral, it has also adapted itself to profit from the increasing number of people who that spiral has left behind. In 2014, 47% of the company\u2019s revenue came from lettings, a far greater proportion than at most other estate agents. The 2014 Foxtons annual report notes with satisfaction: \u201cThe lettings market in London is particularly strong and acts as a useful counter to the more volatile sales market.\u201d Among London estate agents, Chris Millington said, \u201cFoxtons is showing by far the best returns. It\u2019s transacting more than twice as much [business] per branch as the others.\u201d Its influence is felt throughout the industry. \u201cWe\u2019ve all learned from Foxtons,\u201d Dickinson said. \u201cWe all try and do what they\u2019re doing. But they are ahead.\u201d Yet the company\u2019s approach has also made enemies far beyond Brixton. Campaigns against proposed new branches have become a staple of London community politics \u2013 an easy focus for discontent about a steadily less inclusive, more money-driven city. On Twitter, there are @hatefoxtons and @AvoidFoxtons accounts, which seethe with customer complaints and general abuse (\u201ctotal charlatans\u201d, \u201cAvoid Foxtons like the plague!\u201d) and occasional acts of revenge (\u201ctold a traffic warden that a Foxtons mini was parked on double yellows\u201d). This month a larger threat to the company emerged. Chris Townley, a former landlord of a property managed by Foxtons, became the first claimant in a class action against the estate agent. It alleges that Foxtons has overcharged landlords for repairs and maintenance, by deliberately hiring expensive contractors, and then adding to their bills an undeclared commission of up to a third. Townley\u2019s solicitors, Leigh Day, claim that Foxtons could face a cumulative legal bill of up to \u00a342m \u2013 the equivalent of its entire 2014 annual profit. The company declined to comment \u201con the specifics of this case\u201d; but went on to say that \u201cour fees are clearly laid out within our terms and conditions\u201d; and that work on properties let through Foxtons was carried out by \u201ccarefully vetted and trusted contractors\u201d who offered \u201ccompetitive value\u201d. The case may end up in court next year. In 2009, the Office of Fair Trading successfully sued Foxtons for extracting \u201cunfair\u201d charges from landlords. No matter how the latest lettings dispute concludes, it is a reminder that Foxtons is more vulnerable than it looks. For Foxtons, as for many British companies founded in the Thatcher era, new ways of doing things and a measure of ruthlessness have brought success; but of a volatile sort \u2013 and at a cost. * * * The guiding spirit of Foxtons remains its founder, Jon Hunt. He is a lean, reined-in man with a strong jaw, a drawling, slightly distant voice, and impatient, whirling hand gestures. \u201cMy old man was extremely tough,\u201d he told the website Business Life in a rare interview in 2012. \u201cHe was Irish and came to London when he was 13. He was a runner for a legal firm \u2026 then he got into the army.\u201d Hunt junior, born in 1953, soon learned to be just as adaptable and self-contained: while his father took up a succession of end-of-empire foreign postings, Hunt was sent to Millfield boarding school in Somerset from the age of seven. He loved Millfield\u2019s emphasis on sport, but left the school at 16. He briefly joined his father\u2019s regiment, the Royal Artillery, then moved on restlessly again, to work on building sites in France, and then back to England, to a job at a small estate agent in Woking. He was 18. It was the early 70s, the brief boomtime of Edward Heath\u2019s doomed Tory government, and one of Britain\u2019s periodic property bubbles was inflating. Woking, wealthy in parts, full of lush properties, but with a London satellite town\u2019s transient population, was a good place to learn the trade. Hunt has a cautious side \u2013 \u201cI will sit outside a property for six hours watching the traffic flow before I decide [to buy it],\u201d he told the Mail in 2009 \u2013 and he stayed in Woking through the property collapse of the mid-70s. He came to realise that the final stages of such downturns, when prices were low but had stopped falling, was a good time to buy and sell houses \u2013 \u201cwhen there\u2019s blood on the street but it\u2019s drying\u201d, as he put it in the Mail. In 1981, with the British economy stuck in another recession, under Margaret Thatcher, Hunt, now 27, borrowed \u00a330,000 from a Millfield schoolfriend and went looking for somewhere to set up his own estate agency. At the time, most estate agents were open at their own rather than their clients\u2019 convenience \u2013 rarely in the evenings or at weekends \u2013 and their negotiating style, to Hunt at least, was pompous and unambitious. Ivor Dickinson, who started another estate agency not long after him, remembered: \u201cWe were part of an 80s generation, a generation of thrusting young things who wanted to shake up estate agency. We wanted to do everything better: more marketing, more use of information technology, better service for clients. Take it away from being a stuffy old profession.\u201d The territory where Hunt chose to challenge the \u201cwalnut-veneer brigade\u201d, as he called them, was Notting Hill in west London. In 1981 it was not an obvious place for a new estate agent. Since the second world war, the area\u2019s towering Georgian terraces, subdivided and dilapidated, had first been a semi-slum of immigrants and bad landlords, then a counterculture stronghold for squatters and hippies and punks. A reputation for racial tension and street crime lingered well into the 80s. Yet Hunt saw commercial potential in the handsome architecture and the proximity to richer, more respectable areas of west London. On a prominent site on Notting Hill Gate, the main thoroughfare, between a popular cinema and the busy underground station, he took over the premises of a cheap Italian caf\u00e9 called Topo D\u2019Oro. The building was shallow and unlovely, really two knocked together, but it had a broad frontage, and across it in huge letters Hunt spelled out \u201cFoxtons Estate Agents\u201d. The name came from the Cambridgeshire village near where he lived. In contrast to gritty, bohemian Notting Hill, \u201cFoxtons\u201d sounded upper-class, traditional, rural \u2013 the first logo was a deep country green. Hunt hired a secretary and another young estate agent, and started trading from nine in the morning until nine in the evening. To attract customers and publicity, Foxtons sold properties for its first three months without charging commission. It ignored Notting Hill\u2019s large lettings market altogether. \u201cIn our first year we banked \u00a313,000 and [the business] cost us \u00a346,000 to run,\u201d Hunt told Business Life later, \u201cso we were pretty close to bust.\u201d A single big sale in nearby Knightsbridge kept Foxtons afloat. In 1982, with the economy finally growing again, as the Thatcher government\u2019s heavy-handed move away from manufacturing towards property and service industries belatedly began to yield results, the one-year-old estate agent opened a second office, in nearby Fulham: like Notting Hill an inner-city area that was part of the emergent, glossier London. Hunt also hired a lieutenant, Peter Rollings. Rollings was bright, charming, slightly untidy; he became Foxtons\u2019 fixer, its good cop. Meanwhile Hunt, always immaculate in a white shirt and dark suit, rarely smiling, stayed increasingly in the background. \u201cYou would never, ever see him in public,\u201d Dickinson recalled. Estate agents in London, we\u2019re sociable, we all know each other, have lunch together. But he would never lunch with us, sit on committees with us, get involved in industry awards. He\u2019s not a barrel of laughs. He\u2019s not got much time for niceties. He would do anything not to do the same as everyone else.\u201d Foxtons did not advertise alongside other estate agents, but published its own promotional magazine. It did not charge the typical industry commission of between 1% and 2% in London, but 2.5%. In a fast-moving, often over-confident business \u2013 by 1989, the independent annual London Property Guide had fattened to over 600 paperback pages \u2013 Foxtons initially expanded slowly and carefully. The estate agent spent its first decade with only three branches, and took 13 years to move beyond its west London heartland. This caution turned out to be justified when the capital\u2019s 80s property boom, like the wider Thatcherite economic bonanza, shuddered to a halt. But in its chosen markets, Foxtons could be recklessly competitive. From the mid-90s to the early 2000s, the Times reported in 2003, Foxtons employed subcontractors to pull down and destroy thousands of its rivals\u2019 \u201cfor sale\u201d boards. Foxtons admitted that it had done so for \u201ca limited period in 2001\u201d, and a police investigation followed. No charges were brought. It became clear that other London estate agents had also been waging \u201cboard wars\u201d; only the thoroughness with which Foxtons had done so made it stand out. * * * During the 80s and 90s, Foxtons created a distinctive internal culture. Heavily influenced by Hunt\u2019s personality and working habits, it endures, little changed, to this day. In its recruitment and working patterns, in its rewards and penalties, in its use of branding and digital technology, the company has been a pioneer for many of today\u2019s British white-collar employers.At the core of Foxtons is obsessive commitment. Opening for longer hours than rivals means longer working hours for Foxtons staff. The issue dominates whenever they talk about their jobs. \u201cThe hours are completely insane,\u201d posted a former lettings negotiator last year on an online forum where Foxtons employees gather anonymously. \u201cYou work 12 hours a day Mon-Friday PLUS every other weekend, with no lieu days!\u201d A former sales negotiator added: \u201cIt becomes exceptionally difficult to maintain bonds and relationships with people outside [Foxtons] EVEN IF YOU LIVE WITH THEM.\u201d For some staff the single-minded, almost cultish quality of Foxtons is exactly what appeals. Sarah Burgess (not her real name) left university in 2010 with a 2:1 in international relations. She had grown up in the country, and she wanted to live in London, work for a high-profile company, and learn how to do sales. \u201cI wanted to do 70 hours a week,\u201d she told me, \u201cand I knew Foxtons had fancy offices.\u201d A decade earlier, with its branch numbers now in double figures, Foxtons had centralised its operations around a new headquarters in Chiswick in west London. The facility is on an upmarket business park with large glass-sided, open-plan office blocks set beside lawns and an artificial lake. Foxtons\u2019 current neighbours include the American oil conglomerate Halliburton and the jeweller Swarovski. Burgess went to Chiswick for an interview in 2011. \u201cThe head office is so vibey when you\u2019re 18 or 19,\u201d she remembered. \u201cThere\u2019s music playing. It\u2019s colourful inside \u2013 bright green. Everyone\u2019s good-looking, everyone\u2019s smartly dressed, everyone\u2019s so happy! There\u2019s buzzers going, people are collecting chocolates for making sales. You think, \u2018This is a whole world I want to be part of.\u2019\u201d Foxtons recruits constantly and unfussily for its junior positions. \u201cSales experience is beneficial but not essential,\u201d says a recent ad for a \u201ctrainee property negotiator\u201d. Burgess remembered her fellow interviewees as \u201cfrom all over the country, from Scotland, from Wales, from tiny villages. Quite well-educated people, and people who had dropped out of uni. Foxtons said to us, \u2018We\u2019ll give you a car and a phone. You\u2019ll get to know London like the back of your hand.\u2019 And it gave you a friendship group.\u201d Burgess was offered a job as a lettings agent at one of its most prestigious central London branches. \u201cThere was banter at the interview\u201d \u2013 life at Foxtons involves a lot of banter. Then Foxtons trained her. According to its website, the company provides an \u201cintensive induction week for all new employees \u2026 It can even cover the basics like driving around London.\u201d Even the most disillusioned ex-employees agree that the training is good. \u201cFoxtons are very welcoming when you first join,\u201d said one former sales negotiator. \u201cThey really do kit you out \u2026 put you in the right frame of mind so you are ready to go.\u201d Burgess remembered: \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like you were going to be an estate agent, but [to work in] a really buzzy sales career. I don\u2019t know if they used the phrase estate agent.\u201d In 2002, at Hunt\u2019s instigation, the company began stripping out the standard estate agent\u2019s clutter from its branches: the rows of brown desks, the mountainous in-trays behind which discreet phone calls could take place. Ever since, Foxtons has offered its customers what it calls a \u201ccafe-style\u201d environment. Each new branch costs about \u00a3600,000 to fit out. The company\u2019s London rivals typically spend half as much. In 2007 Hunt explained some of the rationale: \u201cThe office coordinator \u2026 gives [customers] refreshment and introduces them to a negotiator. These coordinators have been trained \u2026 to give a warm welcome consistent in all branches.\u201d The types of free drinks, he went on, \u201care selected to be \u2026 sympathetic to our brand.\u201d At today\u2019s Notting Hill Foxtons, across the road from the original site, shiny tins of Italian Illy coffee stand on a shelf in a perfectly spaced line. Burgess\u2019s workplace still took some adjusting to. \u201cIt was so clean. In a Foxtons branch, you will not find a piece of paper anywhere. You\u2019re not allowed to leave anything on your desk \u2013 everything gets cleared away every night. And you move desks every few weeks. You never feel you can relax.\u201d A similar surface orderliness \u2013 with its implication that Foxtons will bring order to the messy property market \u2013 marks the company\u2019s carefully choreographed initial dealings with clients. If you phone a branch as a new customer, you will quickly be redirected to the in-house call centre at headquarters in Chiswick. There, a \u201cnew business consultant\u201d, always polite, usually well-spoken and slightly caffeinated-sounding \u2013 Red Bull is popular with Foxtons staff \u2013 will try to extract personal details from you. This information is fed into the company\u2019s electronic brain: \u201can integrated business operating system (\u201cBOS\u201d),\u201d according to the 2013 Foxtons share prospectus, \u201c that covers all aspects of day-to-day business\u201d. Customers and their data are then passed on to the appropriate branch. Meanwhile, the branches themselves also feed information into the BOS. \u201cEverything is put in,\u201d said Burgess. \u201cEvery note you make, details of every phone call.\u201d The database, according to the prospectus, \u201cas [of] 31 December 2012, contained approximately 3.5 million property records (which compares to London\u2019s population of 8.2 million in 2011) \u2026 and contact details for approximately 2.1 million sales and lettings prospects\u201d. Like other ambitious retailers, Foxtons began investing heavily in data collection and processing in the early 2000s. Its competitors are still struggling to catch up: \u201cThat massive call centre in Chiswick \u2013 it\u2019s an incredible thing,\u201d said Ivor Dickinson. \u201cMost agents will have one person in the back of each branch whose job it is to chase up old [sales] leads. Chiswick has designated people making hundreds of calls a week each. And they sound a buzzer every time a lead is converted into business. Foxtons works on an industrial scale.\u201d Yet the industrialisation of estate agency has its downsides. In the open plan centre at Chiswick, in Foxtons\u2019 goldfish bowl branches, in BOS\u2019s bright digital spaces, staff can never hide. Many former and current staff talk about being \u201cmicromanaged\u201d. The most closely monitored numbers are each negotiator\u2019s sales and lettings figures. Every Friday, for each cluster of Foxtons branches, there is a compulsory end-of-week meeting. Several dozen negotiators gather in a room and sit on rows of chairs in front of a big screen. \u201cFirst, there is a pep talk \u2013 or you\u2019re all told off,\u201d Burgess remembered, \u201cand then you get to shout out your figures. It shows on the screen where you are in the rankings. If you\u2019ve done well, you\u2019re buzzing. It\u2019s one of the funnest parts of the week.\u201d Successful employees are offered an elaborate sequence of bonuses. There are \u201ctrip targets\u201d \u2013 sales attainments that earn company-funded skiing or Mediterranean holidays; and \u201ccar targets\u201d \u2013 first a Mini, then a BMW, then a Mercedes. The slick Foxtons website shows packs of tanned, beaming, sometimes flirtatious staff holding beers, up mountains, playing beach volleyball. Burgess said that working at Foxtons sometimes feels \u201clike being in a sports team, when you get a new kit. You all smell good. You feel you\u2019re the dog\u2019s bollocks.\u201d Like you\u2019re an elite? \u201cNo \u2026 a gang!\u201d Yet less successful employees can suffer badly. Negotiators receive an initial salary of \u00a322,000, but once they are considered sufficiently experienced, usually after about four months, they can earn commission: either 5% of Foxtons\u2019 overall take on each transaction, plus a salary of \u00a317,500; or 10% and a salary of \u00a310,000. Most opt for the latter. It pays lavishly if things are going well: a negotiator selling a property for \u00a31m earns a bonus of \u00a32,500. But in lean periods the low basic salary, which has not changed for a decade, quickly threatens to make living in London impossible \u2013 not least because of the capital\u2019s high property costs, for which Foxtons negotiators are themselves partly responsible. \u201cYou can have really bad weeks, months \u2013 it\u2019s scary,\u201d Burgess said. Foxtons has a more individualistic culture than its rivals, who generally pay higher basic salaries and sometimes hand out commission on a team basis. At Foxtons branches, the negotiators\u2019 telephones are arranged facing each other, in gladiatorial rows. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, the young men in suits are always ducking outside to make calls. In 2006, Anna Adams, an undercover reporter for the BBC1 series Whistleblower, filmed a Friday meeting where, when individuals\u2019 sales or lettings figures were announced under-performers were heckled. The documentary, which examined several estate agency firms, also included footage of a Foxtons induction session, in which a training officer told new employees: \u201cWe are associated with sharp sales tactics. People believe that we are going to try to sell them something for a lot more money than they want to spend \u2026 [or] somewhere that is completely different to their requirements. And funnily enough, they\u2019re not wrong in that.\u201d Adams got a job as a sales negotiator and was posted to the original Notting Hill branch. There she said she was encouraged to exaggerate how much properties were worth, in order to attract sellers; to invent high offers for properties, in order to persuade buyers to raise theirs; and to pressure buyers to use a mortgage broker owned by Foxtons, Alexander Hall \u2013 which the programme alleged was illegally passing details of buyers\u2019 finances back to Foxtons, so that the estate agent could know how far to push them. The film also showed Foxtons staff forging signatures and altering sales documents with Tipp-Ex and scissors, to their own or the company\u2019s advantage. The practices even had their own winking slang: \u201cchop-chop\u201d, or \u201csimmering\u201d. Eight months after the broadcast, and after threatening the BBC with lawsuits, Hunt admitted to the Guardian that there were \u201cseveral things we had done in [the documentary] that were wrong\u201d. But he went on, \u201cI don\u2019t think [they] were pervasive \u2026 and we straightened those out.\u201d He dismissed the allegation that Foxtons and Alexander Hall illegally shared information as \u201ctotal nonsense\u201d. * * * Nowadays, Foxtons sometimes presents itself as an ethical business. A recent advertisement for a \u201cgraduate property consultant\u201d says that \u201ca clearly defined moral compass is a must\u201d, and that the company is \u201can environment where we compete \u2026 but support each other\u201d. Yet Foxtons\u2019 approach to outside scrutiny makes such claims hard to judge. \u201cWe don\u2019t do interviews,\u201d Nicky Chute, the company\u2019s head of communications, told me when I contacted her. Foxtons\u2019 current CEO, Nic Budden, she went on, \u201cis a fairly private person\u201d. Ivor Dickinson, for one, doubts whether the company has softened that much: \u201cIn a highly commission-based environment, you are encouraging the negotiator to act for himself, not the client.\u201d Sarah Burgess said: \u201cTelling people you\u2019re an estate agent is bad enough, but telling people you work for Foxtons is a double blow.\u201d She left after 15 months. \u201cA year and a half is a pretty good innings at Foxtons. It drains you. Everyone looks so much healthier after they leave.\u201d The small minority who stay on for many years and climb the company hierarchy are known internally as \u201cFoxtons till they die\u201d. Hunt said to Business Life of his 26 years in charge: \u201cWe were very inward looking.\u201d In 2005, Hunt\u2019s lieutenant Peter Rollings left to set up a competitor, Marsh &amp; Parsons. By 2007 even Hunt had had enough. \u201cI was working 14 hours a day \u2026 I was in my 50s and it\u2019s a young man\u2019s game,\u201d he told Business Life later. He sold his creation to a private equity firm, BC Partners, and shifted his energies to renovating Heveningham Hall, a country estate in Suffolk, successfully investing his Foxtons fortune in London property and, as if awarding himself a final \u201ccar target\u201d, collecting Ferraris. A few months later, in 2008, for the first time in a decade and a half, London property prices began to drop. For the next three years, Foxtons suffered collapsing sales and staff culls. There were hasty and acrimonious shifts of ownership between BC Partners and the banks that had lent it the money to buy the company. At BC Partners, senior people began referring to Foxtons as \u201cthe F word\u201d. There were predictions in the press \u2013 sometimes thinly disguised hopes \u2013 that it would go bust. The estate agent had become expensive to run. Since the late 90s, during the seemingly endless economic good times of the Tony Blair administration, Foxtons had increasingly moved away from Hunt\u2019s original vision of step-by-step growth. Instead, it rapidly opened branches and annually redecorated its fleet of Minis. One design, \u201cThe 2005 \u2018Camo\u2019 Mini\u201d, was described by the company as \u201cinspired by \u2018urban jungle\u2019 culture\u201d and \u201ccontemporary London street fashion\u201d. Perhaps only an estate agent could say that about a mishmash of camouflage and country house green. In 2000, Foxtons expanded across the Atlantic to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Foxtons North America, as the offshoot eventually called itself, had its own Minis, almost 400 staff, and splashy advertising \u2013 such as a giant billboard above a tunnel entrance on the road back to New York City from the smart resort of East Hampton. But the company proved no match for dug-in local real estate agents and the late 2000s recession. In 2007, it filed for bankruptcy. \u201cFoxtons is very good at what it does,\u201d said the analyst Chris Millington, \u201cbut it can\u2019t go against the whims of the property market.\u201d * * * Like much of the British economy, Foxtons seems to have two modes: either overconfident expansion or panicky retrenchment. Since 2011, as the London house price bubble has reinflated, the business has resumed its upward path. But now it is a public company, with a fickle share price, and more of the detail of the estate agent\u2019s performance is publicly available. In its latest annual report, a small graph at the bottom of page 19 shows that since 2010, as the company has opened branches faster than ever, its average revenue has dropped year by year, and by more than a fifth overall. In a world where valuing your own property is easy, thanks to all the online price data for comparable homes; and in a city where demand for housing drastically outstrips supply \u2013 where your scruffy Hackney terrace would probably sell if you just stuck a note in the window \u2013 the Foxtons model may not be sustainable in the long term. \u201cThey have always charged a premium [commission] for sales and lettings,\u201d said Gavin Jago, a property analyst at the brokers Peel Hunt. \u201cOnline estate agents are starting to charge considerably less.\u201d The rising online firm Purplebricks.com currently charges a maximum of \u00a31,158 to sell a London home \u2013 less than a tenth of Foxtons\u2019 average commission. Some senior estate agents outside Foxtons predict that, over the next decade, the market share of online firms will grow from a thirtieth to as much as half. Yet sharks never stop swimming. In April, on the same weekend as the window-smashing in Brixton, I visited another Foxtons, a brand new branch in Bromley, on the more sedate fringes of south London. It was a cold dark Sunday, not house-hunting weather, and every other estate agent I passed in the suburb\u2019s grey centre was closed. But Foxtons selects its new markets with what it calls \u201cgranular\u201d attention to local sales and lettings data, and increasingly sees its future in more affordable outer London. For all the company\u2019s provocatively prosperous image, last year the average price it secured for a property was \u00a3544,000, only \u00a330,000 above the value of the average London home. The Bromley branch was deserted except for two staff, both sleekly dressed young women, and neat rows of paper bags, each containing a flyer for the branch and a chocolate muffin. One of the women would spend the next few hours doggedly handing out the bags, bare-legged in the wind, to hundreds of passersby. I asked how business was going. \u201cIt\u2019s 0% commission on the first hundred houses,\u201d she said, with a rigidly eager smile. \u201cWe\u2019ve already done 25 valuations.\u201d There was already a Foxtons in nearby Beckenham. What if, I asked, a property came on the market midway between the two branches? Which one would deal with the seller and any buyers? She instantly turned deadpan: \u201cIt depends on who they call first.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread",

      "body": "<p>From the street, the Foxtons in Brixton in south London, like the estate agent\u2019s other 55 branches, is almost all glass. Two great floor-to-ceiling windows, separated by a slender pillar, reveal a trademark Foxtons interior, unlike those of other estate agents: all pale, smooth surfaces, very bright lighting and very little furniture. There is a reception desk, a fridge of drinks for customers, a few clusters of modular white tables and chairs of the kind you might find in a loft apartment that was not quite as cool as it thought it was, and a couple of low display cases containing photos of two dozen properties for sale and for let. An unremarkable one-bedroom flat in a plain street nearby is offered at \u201c\u00a3346.15 per week, \u00a32,077 deposit + \u00a3420 (inc VAT) admin fee*\u201d. The advertisement does not explain the asterisk.</p> <p>The Brixton Foxtons has been open for two years, glowing like an alien spacecraft, seven days a week and deep into the evenings, among the takeaways and bus stops and bargain clothes shops of Brixton Road.

In July 2013, protesters managed to get into the branch and unfurl a \u201cYuppies Out\u201d banner. This April, the branch was briefly occupied again by demonstrators holding placards that read \u201cSocial Housing Not Social Cleansing\u201d. A few weeks later, during a generally peaceful anti-gentrification march on 25 April, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/apr/25/police-use-cs-spray-as-anti-gentrification-protesters-mass-in-brixton\">half the frontage of Foxtons was smashed in</a>.</p> <p>Six days later, there were still bits of glass on the pavement and the window was boarded up. But the branch was open for business. Young men in dark suits, with crisp white shirts and disciplined haircuts \u2013 \u201cproperty negotiators\u201d in Foxtons jargon \u2013 strode impatiently in and out, upright as young army officers, swinging their company car keys, working on buyers on their company phones. Inside, behind the spotless white reception desk, a young woman in heels and heavy makeup \u2013 the \u201coffice co-ordinator\u201d \u2013 was waiting, as usual, to greet customers. At one of the equally spotless white tables, a nervous-looking client, a casually dressed man of about 30, was writing a list of properties on a pad of paper, as a negotiator watched from the chair opposite. In a short side street immediately round the corner, there were two fresh Foxtons for sale signs. As Chris Millington, a property business analyst at Numis Securities, told me: \u201cFoxtons do very well down in Brixton.\u201d</p> <h2><br>* * *</h2> <p><strong>By common consent,</strong> London is one of the most frenzied and important property markets in the world: according to the Land Registry, it accounts for nearly half the value of all residential sales in England and Wales. But even in the intensely competitive field of London estate agency, Foxtons has acquired a unique, double-edged reputation: for relentlessness and innovation; for brashness and aggression; for bending \u2013 and sometimes breaking \u2013 the profession\u2019s infamously loose rules; for doing almost anything to get a letting or a sale. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough firm,\u201d its founder <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/nov/20/8\">Jon Hunt</a> told the Daily Mail in 2009. (Hunt declined to be interviewed for this article.) Two years before, on the eve of the last property crash, he had sold his stake in the business for a reported \u00a3390m.</p> <p>Foxtons is not a huge company. Its share of the London residential market is estimated at between 10 and 20%. It currently has about 1,300 staff \u2013 the number expands and contracts as abruptly as the housing market itself. Its branches are outnumbered by those of rival networks: the national estate agency group Countrywide has 1,400 outposts. Foxtons operates solely in London and the Surrey towns of Woking and Guildford. Its branches cover about half the capital, including the centre, the most prosperous parts of west London, fashionable inner suburbs such as Hackney and Walthamstow, and more quietly rising outer ones such as Enfield.</p> <p>Each time Foxtons moves into a new area, and its logo of acid yellow and patrician green suddenly appears on \u201cfor sale\u201d signs, on letters to local homeowners, on flashy new Foxtons premises, and on the loudly branded Minis the company provides for its negotiators, the character and status of that place seems to alter. There can be unease, even anger but there can also be a less publicly expressed excitement. As Ivor Dickinson, until recently managing director of one of Foxtons\u2019 competitors, Douglas and Gordon, put it: \u201cIf you have a name as a really ruthless, sharky bastard estate agent, a lot of people, when they come to selling their house, will think, \u2018I want that ruthless, sharky bastard.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Each time Foxtons moves into a new area the character and status of that place seems to alter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The swaggering success of Foxtons is partly a product of the double standards many of us have about property: complaining and worrying about the cost of it, while wanting to make as much as possible from it ourselves. The company is also a reflection of the modern British economy: short-term in its priorities, sometimes vibrant, London-dominated, property-skewed, socially divisive. The estate agent\u2019s fortunes have become symbolic. Last month, the day the Conservative general election victory was announced, and with it the demise of Labour\u2019s plans to increase taxes on properties worth more than \u00a32m, it was widely noted by despairing leftwingers, as well as excited business reporters, that the Foxtons share price had leapt 12%.</p> <p>Since David Cameron became prime minister in 2010, Foxtons has almost doubled its number of branches, and more than trebled its annual profits, to \u00a342m. When Foxtons became a public company in 2013, it was initially valued at \u00a3650m; within six months, demand for its shares had swelled that value to \u00a31.1bn.</p> <p>Investors like Foxtons partly because it plays the property game two ways. As well as helping to drive the upward price spiral, it has also adapted itself to profit from the increasing number of people who that spiral has left behind. In 2014, 47% of the company\u2019s revenue came from lettings, a far greater proportion than at most other estate agents. The 2014 Foxtons annual report notes with satisfaction: \u201cThe lettings market in London is particularly strong and acts as a useful counter to the more volatile sales market.\u201d Among London estate agents, Chris Millington said, \u201cFoxtons is showing by far the best returns. It\u2019s transacting more than twice as much [business] per branch as the others.\u201d Its influence is felt throughout the industry. \u201cWe\u2019ve all learned from Foxtons,\u201d Dickinson said. \u201cWe all try and do what they\u2019re doing. But they are ahead.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4b892a0ec2bf83a107770ce74881fb61388a4b49\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434460205329/6cf12d22-9a98-4455-9120-c8071200a734-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A Foxtons-branded Mini.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Foxtons-branded Mini.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the company\u2019s approach has also made enemies far beyond Brixton. Campaigns against proposed new branches have become a staple of London community politics \u2013 an easy focus for discontent about a steadily less inclusive, more money-driven city. On Twitter, there are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hatefoxtons\">@hatefoxtons</a> and @AvoidFoxtons accounts, which seethe with customer complaints and general abuse (\u201ctotal charlatans\u201d, \u201cAvoid Foxtons like the plague!\u201d) and occasional acts of revenge (\u201ctold a traffic warden that a Foxtons mini was parked on double yellows\u201d).</p> <p>This month a larger threat to the company emerged. Chris Townley, a former landlord of a property managed by Foxtons, became the first claimant in a c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/07/foxtons-commission-charge-sparks-legal-action-from-landlords\">lass action against the estate agent</a>. It alleges that Foxtons has overcharged landlords for repairs and maintenance, by deliberately hiring expensive contractors, and then adding to their bills an undeclared commission of up to a third. Townley\u2019s solicitors, Leigh Day, claim that Foxtons could face a cumulative legal bill of up to \u00a342m \u2013 the equivalent of its entire 2014 annual profit.</p> <p>The company declined to comment \u201con the specifics of this case\u201d; but went on to say that \u201cour fees are clearly laid out within our terms and conditions\u201d; and that work on properties let through Foxtons was carried out by \u201ccarefully vetted and trusted contractors\u201d who offered \u201ccompetitive value\u201d. The case may end up in court next year.</p> <p>In 2009, the Office of Fair Trading successfully sued Foxtons for extracting \u201cunfair\u201d charges from landlords. No matter how the latest lettings dispute concludes, it is a reminder that Foxtons is more vulnerable than it looks. For Foxtons, as for many British companies founded in the Thatcher era, new ways of doing things and a measure of ruthlessness have brought success; but of a volatile sort \u2013 and at a cost.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>The guiding spirit of Foxtons remains its founder, </strong>Jon Hunt. He is a lean, reined-in man with a strong jaw, a drawling, slightly distant voice, and impatient, whirling hand gestures. \u201cMy old man was extremely tough,\u201d he told the website Business Life <a href=\"http://businesslife.ba.com/People/What-Ive-Learnt/What-Ive-learnt-Jon-Hunt.html\">in a rare interview in 2012</a>. \u201cHe was Irish and came to London when he was 13. He was a runner for a legal firm \u2026 then he got into the army.\u201d Hunt junior, born in 1953, soon learned to be just as adaptable and self-contained: while his father took up a succession of end-of-empire foreign postings, Hunt was sent to Millfield boarding school in Somerset from the age of seven. He loved Millfield\u2019s emphasis on sport, but left the school at 16. He briefly joined his father\u2019s regiment, the Royal Artillery, then moved on restlessly again, to work on building sites in France, and then back to England, to a job at a small estate agent in Woking.</p> <p>He was 18. It was the early 70s, the brief boomtime of Edward Heath\u2019s doomed Tory government, and one of Britain\u2019s periodic property bubbles was inflating. Woking, wealthy in parts, full of lush properties, but with a London satellite town\u2019s transient population, was a good place to learn the trade. Hunt has a cautious side \u2013 \u201cI will sit outside a property for six hours watching the traffic flow before I decide [to buy it],\u201d he told the Mail in 2009 \u2013 and he stayed in Woking through the property collapse of the mid-70s. He came to realise that the final stages of such downturns, when prices were low but had stopped falling, was a good time to buy and sell houses \u2013 \u201cwhen there\u2019s blood on the street but it\u2019s drying\u201d, as he put it in the Mail.</p> <p>In 1981, with the British economy stuck in another recession, under Margaret Thatcher, Hunt, now 27, borrowed \u00a330,000 from a Millfield schoolfriend and went looking for somewhere to set up his own estate agency. At the time, most estate agents were open at their own rather than their clients\u2019 convenience \u2013 rarely in the evenings or at weekends \u2013 and their negotiating style, to Hunt at least, was pompous and unambitious. Ivor Dickinson, who started another estate agency not long after him, remembered: \u201cWe were part of an 80s generation, a generation of thrusting young things who wanted to shake up estate agency. We wanted to do everything better: more marketing, more use of information technology, better service for clients. Take it away from being a stuffy old profession.\u201d</p> <p>The territory where Hunt chose to challenge the \u201cwalnut-veneer brigade\u201d, as he called them, was Notting Hill in west London. In 1981 it was not an obvious place for a new estate agent. Since the second world war, the area\u2019s towering Georgian terraces, subdivided and dilapidated, had first been a semi-slum of immigrants and bad landlords, then a counterculture stronghold for squatters and hippies and punks. A reputation for racial tension and street crime lingered well into the 80s. Yet Hunt saw commercial potential in the handsome architecture and the proximity to richer, more respectable areas of west London. On a prominent site on Notting Hill Gate, the main thoroughfare, between a popular cinema and the busy underground station, he took over the premises of a cheap Italian caf\u00e9 called Topo D\u2019Oro.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3d96af437152fae41f21e52485d5ebd68550fa44\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434460556203/64e0ae81-2ea1-4ad0-84ae-acdf4cbe0e7f-460x400.jpeg\" alt=\"The founder of Foxtons, Jon Hunt, in 2006\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jon Hunt, the founder of Foxtons, sold his stake in the company in 2007 for a reported \u00a3390m.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The building was shallow and unlovely, really two knocked together, but it had a broad frontage, and across it in huge letters Hunt spelled out \u201cFoxtons Estate Agents\u201d. The name came from the Cambridgeshire village near where he lived. In contrast to gritty, bohemian Notting Hill, \u201cFoxtons\u201d sounded upper-class, traditional, rural \u2013 the first logo was a deep country green. Hunt hired a secretary and another young estate agent, and started trading from nine in the morning until nine in the evening. To attract customers and publicity, Foxtons sold properties for its first three months without charging commission. It ignored Notting Hill\u2019s large lettings market altogether. \u201cIn our first year we banked \u00a313,000 and [the business] cost us \u00a346,000 to run,\u201d Hunt told Business Life later, \u201cso we were pretty close to bust.\u201d</p> <p>A single big sale in nearby Knightsbridge kept Foxtons afloat. In 1982, with the economy finally growing again, as the Thatcher government\u2019s heavy-handed move away from manufacturing towards property and service industries belatedly began to yield results, the one-year-old estate agent opened a second office, in nearby Fulham: like Notting Hill an inner-city area that was part of the emergent, glossier London. Hunt also hired a lieutenant, Peter Rollings.</p> <p>Rollings was bright, charming, slightly untidy; he became Foxtons\u2019 fixer, its good cop. Meanwhile Hunt, always immaculate in a white shirt and dark suit, rarely smiling, stayed increasingly in the background. \u201cYou would never, ever see him in public,\u201d Dickinson recalled. Estate agents in London, we\u2019re sociable, we all know each other, have lunch together. But he would never lunch with us, sit on committees with us, get involved in industry awards. He\u2019s not a barrel of laughs. He\u2019s not got much time for niceties. He would do anything not to do the same as everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>Foxtons did not advertise alongside other estate agents, but published its own promotional magazine. It did not charge the typical industry commission of between 1% and 2% in London, but 2.5%. In a fast-moving, often over-confident business \u2013 by 1989, the independent annual London Property Guide had fattened to over 600 paperback pages \u2013 Foxtons initially expanded slowly and carefully. The estate agent spent its first decade with only three branches, and took 13 years to move beyond its west London heartland. This caution turned out to be justified when the capital\u2019s 80s property boom, like the wider Thatcherite economic bonanza, shuddered to a halt.</p> <p>But in its chosen markets, Foxtons could be recklessly competitive. From the mid-90s to the early 2000s, the Times reported in 2003, Foxtons employed subcontractors to pull down and destroy thousands of its rivals\u2019 \u201cfor sale\u201d boards. Foxtons admitted that it had done so for \u201ca limited period in 2001\u201d, and a police investigation followed. No charges were brought. It became clear that other London estate agents had also been waging \u201cboard wars\u201d; only the thoroughness with which Foxtons had done so made it stand out.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>During the 80s and 90s,</strong> Foxtons created a distinctive internal culture. Heavily influenced by Hunt\u2019s personality and working habits, it endures, little changed, to this day. In its recruitment and working patterns, in its rewards and penalties, in its use of branding and digital technology, the company has been a pioneer for many of today\u2019s British white-collar employers.At the core of Foxtons is obsessive commitment. Opening for longer hours than rivals means longer working hours for Foxtons staff. The issue dominates whenever they talk about their jobs. \u201cThe hours are completely insane,\u201d posted a former lettings negotiator last year on an online forum where Foxtons employees gather anonymously. \u201cYou work 12 hours a day Mon-Friday PLUS every other weekend, with no lieu days!\u201d A former sales negotiator added: \u201cIt becomes exceptionally difficult to maintain bonds and relationships with people outside [Foxtons] EVEN IF YOU LIVE WITH THEM.\u201d</p> <p>For some staff the single-minded, almost cultish quality of Foxtons is exactly what appeals. Sarah Burgess (not her real name) left university in 2010 with a 2:1 in international relations. She had grown up in the country, and she wanted to live in London, work for a high-profile company, and learn how to do sales. \u201cI wanted to do 70 hours a week,\u201d she told me, \u201cand I knew Foxtons had fancy offices.\u201d</p> <p>A decade earlier, with its branch numbers now in double figures, Foxtons had centralised its operations around a new headquarters in Chiswick in west London. The facility is on an upmarket business park with large glass-sided, open-plan office blocks set beside lawns and an artificial lake. Foxtons\u2019 current neighbours include the American oil conglomerate Halliburton and the jeweller Swarovski.</p> <p>Burgess went to Chiswick for an interview in 2011. \u201cThe head office is so vibey when you\u2019re 18 or 19,\u201d she remembered. \u201cThere\u2019s music playing. It\u2019s colourful inside \u2013 bright green. Everyone\u2019s good-looking, everyone\u2019s smartly dressed, everyone\u2019s so happy! There\u2019s buzzers going, people are collecting chocolates for making sales. You think, \u2018This is a whole world I want to be part of.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Foxtons recruits constantly and unfussily for its junior positions. \u201cSales experience is beneficial but not essential,\u201d says a recent ad for a \u201ctrainee property negotiator\u201d. Burgess remembered her fellow interviewees as \u201cfrom all over the country, from Scotland, from Wales, from tiny villages. Quite well-educated people, and people who had dropped out of uni. Foxtons said to us, \u2018We\u2019ll give you a car and a phone. You\u2019ll get to know London like the back of your hand.\u2019 And it gave you a friendship group.\u201d</p> <p>Burgess was offered a job as a lettings agent at one of its most prestigious central London branches. \u201cThere was banter at the interview\u201d \u2013 life at Foxtons involves a lot of banter.<strong> </strong>Then Foxtons trained her. According to its website, the company provides an \u201cintensive induction week for all new employees \u2026 It can even cover the basics like driving around London.\u201d Even the most disillusioned ex-employees agree that the training is good. \u201cFoxtons are very welcoming when you first join,\u201d said one former sales negotiator. \u201cThey really do kit you out \u2026 put you in the right frame of mind so you are ready to go.\u201d Burgess remembered: \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like you were going to be an estate agent, but [to work in] a really buzzy sales career. I don\u2019t know if they used the phrase estate agent.\u201d</p> <p>In 2002, at Hunt\u2019s instigation, the company began stripping out the standard estate agent\u2019s clutter from its branches: the rows of brown desks, the mountainous in-trays behind which discreet phone calls could take place. Ever since, Foxtons has offered its customers what it calls a \u201ccafe-style\u201d environment. Each new branch costs about \u00a3600,000 to fit out. The company\u2019s London rivals typically spend half as much. In 2007 Hunt explained some of the rationale: \u201cThe office coordinator \u2026 gives [customers] refreshment and introduces them to a negotiator. These coordinators have been trained \u2026 to give a warm welcome consistent in all branches.\u201d The types of free drinks, he went on, \u201care selected to be \u2026 sympathetic to our brand.\u201d At today\u2019s Notting Hill Foxtons, across the road from the original site, shiny tins of Italian Illy coffee stand on a shelf in a perfectly spaced line.</p> <p>Burgess\u2019s workplace still took some adjusting to. \u201cIt was so clean. In a Foxtons branch, you will not find a piece of paper anywhere. You\u2019re not allowed to leave anything on your desk \u2013 everything gets cleared away every night. And you move desks every few weeks. You never feel you can relax.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"98b11bae91532780863b2a67e31378d9f3632ac2\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434463023021/b6a71ef3-5a41-4545-815f-523e666a9b74-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A paperless Foxtons office.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A paperless Foxtons office.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A similar surface orderliness \u2013 with its implication that Foxtons will bring order to the messy property market \u2013 marks the company\u2019s carefully choreographed initial dealings with clients. If you phone a branch as a new customer, you will quickly be redirected to the in-house call centre at headquarters in Chiswick. There, a \u201cnew business consultant\u201d, always polite, usually well-spoken and slightly caffeinated-sounding \u2013 Red Bull is popular with Foxtons staff \u2013 will try to extract personal details from you.</p> <p>This information is fed into the company\u2019s electronic brain: \u201can integrated business operating system (\u201cBOS\u201d),\u201d according to the 2013 Foxtons share prospectus, \u201c that covers all aspects of day-to-day business\u201d. Customers and their data are then passed on to the appropriate branch. Meanwhile, the branches themselves also feed information into the BOS. \u201cEverything is put in,\u201d said Burgess. \u201cEvery note you make, details of every phone call.\u201d The database, according to the prospectus, \u201cas [of] 31 December 2012, contained approximately 3.5 million property records (which compares to London\u2019s population of 8.2 million in 2011) \u2026 and contact details for approximately 2.1 million sales and lettings prospects\u201d.</p> <p>Like other ambitious retailers, Foxtons began investing heavily in data collection and processing in the early 2000s. Its competitors are still struggling to catch up: \u201cThat massive call centre in Chiswick \u2013 it\u2019s an incredible thing,\u201d said Ivor Dickinson. \u201cMost agents will have one person in the back of each branch whose job it is to chase up old [sales] leads. Chiswick has designated people making hundreds of calls a week each. And they sound a buzzer every time a lead is converted into business. Foxtons works on an industrial scale.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the industrialisation of estate agency has its downsides. In the open plan centre at Chiswick, in Foxtons\u2019 goldfish bowl branches, in BOS\u2019s bright digital spaces, staff can never hide. Many former and current staff talk about being \u201cmicromanaged\u201d. The most closely monitored numbers are each negotiator\u2019s sales and lettings figures. Every Friday, for each cluster of Foxtons branches, there is a compulsory end-of-week meeting. Several dozen negotiators gather in a room and sit on rows of chairs in front of a big screen.</p> <p>\u201cFirst, there is a pep talk \u2013 or you\u2019re all told off,\u201d Burgess remembered, \u201cand then you get to shout out your figures. It shows on the screen where you are in the rankings. If you\u2019ve done well, you\u2019re buzzing. It\u2019s one of the funnest parts of the week.\u201d Successful employees are offered an elaborate sequence of bonuses. There are \u201ctrip targets\u201d \u2013 sales attainments that earn company-funded skiing or Mediterranean holidays; and \u201ccar targets\u201d \u2013 first a Mini, then a BMW, then a Mercedes. The slick Foxtons website shows packs of tanned, beaming, sometimes flirtatious staff holding beers, up mountains, playing beach volleyball. Burgess said that working at Foxtons sometimes feels \u201clike being in a sports team, when you get a new kit. You all smell good. You feel you\u2019re the dog\u2019s bollocks.\u201d Like you\u2019re an elite? \u201cNo \u2026 a gang!\u201d <br></p> <p>Yet less successful employees can suffer badly. Negotiators receive an initial salary of \u00a322,000, but once they are considered sufficiently experienced, usually after about four months, they can earn commission: either 5% of Foxtons\u2019 overall take on each transaction, plus a salary of \u00a317,500; or 10% and a salary of \u00a310,000. Most opt for the latter. It pays lavishly if things are going well: a negotiator selling a property for \u00a31m earns a bonus of \u00a32,500. But in lean periods the low basic salary, which has not changed for a decade, quickly threatens to make living in London impossible \u2013 not least because of the capital\u2019s high property costs, for which Foxtons negotiators are themselves partly responsible. \u201cYou can have really bad weeks, months \u2013 it\u2019s scary,\u201d Burgess said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4d012eea5c7f288bae6fd7518f409e427987b33c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434461478640/6e5a69fa-f22e-440f-a8d6-bab1efbc38cb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Foxtons operates solely in wealthy and fashionable parts of London, as well as Woking and Guildford.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Foxtons operates solely in London and the Surrey commuter towns of Woking and Guildford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Micha Theiner/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Foxtons has a more individualistic culture than its rivals, who generally pay higher basic salaries and sometimes hand out commission on a team basis. At Foxtons branches, the negotiators\u2019 telephones are arranged facing each other, in gladiatorial rows. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, the young men in suits are always ducking outside to make calls. In 2006, Anna Adams, an undercover reporter for the BBC1 series Whistleblower, filmed a Friday meeting where, when individuals\u2019 sales or lettings figures were announced under-performers were heckled.</p> <p>The documentary, which examined several estate agency firms, also included footage of a Foxtons induction session, in which a training officer told new employees: \u201cWe are associated with sharp sales tactics. People believe that we are going to try to sell them something for a lot more money than they want to spend \u2026 [or] somewhere that is completely different to their requirements. And funnily enough, they\u2019re not wrong in that.\u201d</p> <p>Adams got a job as a sales negotiator and was posted to the original Notting Hill branch. There she said she was encouraged to exaggerate how much properties were worth, in order to attract sellers; to invent high offers for properties, in order to persuade buyers to raise theirs; and to pressure buyers to use a mortgage broker owned by Foxtons, Alexander Hall \u2013 which the programme alleged was illegally passing details of buyers\u2019 finances back to Foxtons, so that the estate agent could know how far to push them. The film also showed Foxtons staff forging signatures and altering sales documents with Tipp-Ex and scissors, to their own or the company\u2019s advantage. The practices even had their own winking slang: \u201cchop-chop\u201d, or \u201csimmering\u201d.</p> <p>Eight months after the broadcast, and after threatening the BBC with lawsuits, Hunt <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2006/nov/25/houseprices.comment\">admitted to the Guardian</a> that there were \u201cseveral things we had done in [the documentary] that were wrong\u201d. But he went on, \u201cI don\u2019t think [they] were pervasive \u2026 and we straightened those out.\u201d He dismissed the allegation that Foxtons and Alexander Hall illegally shared information as \u201ctotal nonsense\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Nowadays, Foxtons sometimes presents itself</strong> as an ethical business. A recent advertisement for a \u201cgraduate property consultant\u201d says that \u201ca clearly defined moral compass is a must\u201d, and that the company is \u201can environment where we compete \u2026 but support each other\u201d. Yet Foxtons\u2019 approach to outside scrutiny makes such claims hard to judge. \u201cWe don\u2019t do interviews,\u201d Nicky Chute, the company\u2019s head of communications, told me when I contacted her. Foxtons\u2019 current CEO, Nic Budden, she went on, \u201cis a fairly private person\u201d.</p> <p>Ivor Dickinson, for one, doubts whether the company has softened that much: \u201cIn a highly commission-based environment, you are encouraging the negotiator to act for himself, not the client.\u201d Sarah Burgess said: \u201cTelling people you\u2019re an estate agent is bad enough, but telling people you work for Foxtons is a double blow.\u201d She left after 15 months. \u201cA year and a half is a pretty good innings at Foxtons. It drains you. Everyone looks so much healthier after they leave.\u201d The small minority who stay on for many years and climb the company hierarchy are known internally as \u201cFoxtons till they die\u201d. Hunt said to Business Life of his 26 years in charge: \u201cWe were very inward looking.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Telling people you\u2019re an estate agent is bad enough, but telling people you work for Foxtons is a double blow</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2005, Hunt\u2019s lieutenant Peter Rollings left to set up a competitor, Marsh &amp; Parsons. By 2007 even Hunt had had enough. \u201cI was working 14 hours a day \u2026 I was in my 50s and it\u2019s a young man\u2019s game,\u201d he told Business Life later. He sold his creation to a private equity firm, BC Partners, and shifted his energies to renovating Heveningham Hall, a country estate in Suffolk, successfully investing his Foxtons fortune in London property and, as if awarding himself a final \u201ccar target\u201d, collecting Ferraris.</p> <p>A few months later, in 2008, for the first time in a decade and a half, London property prices began to drop. For the next three years, Foxtons suffered collapsing sales and staff culls. There were hasty and acrimonious shifts of ownership between BC Partners and the banks that had lent it the money to buy the company. At BC Partners, senior people began referring to Foxtons as \u201cthe F word\u201d. There were predictions in the press \u2013 sometimes thinly disguised hopes \u2013 that it would go bust.</p> <p>The estate agent had become expensive to run. Since the late 90s, during the seemingly endless economic good times of the Tony Blair administration, Foxtons had increasingly moved away from Hunt\u2019s original vision of step-by-step growth. Instead, it rapidly opened branches and annually redecorated its fleet of Minis. One design, \u201cThe 2005 \u2018Camo\u2019 Mini\u201d, was described by the company as \u201cinspired by \u2018urban jungle\u2019 culture\u201d and \u201ccontemporary London street fashion\u201d. Perhaps only an estate agent could say that about a mishmash of camouflage and country house green.</p> <p>In 2000, Foxtons expanded across the Atlantic to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Foxtons North America, as the offshoot eventually called itself, had its own Minis, almost 400 staff, and splashy advertising \u2013 such as a giant billboard above a tunnel entrance on the road back to New York City from the smart resort of East Hampton. But the company proved no match for dug-in local real estate agents and the late 2000s recession. In 2007, it filed for bankruptcy. \u201cFoxtons is very good at what it does,\u201d said the analyst Chris Millington, \u201cbut it can\u2019t go against the whims of the property market.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Like much of the British economy, </strong>Foxtons seems to have two modes: either overconfident expansion or panicky retrenchment. Since 2011, as the London house price bubble has reinflated, the business has resumed its upward path. But now it is a public company, with a fickle share price, and more of the detail of the estate agent\u2019s performance is publicly available<strong>.</strong> In its latest annual report, a small graph at the bottom of page 19 shows that since 2010, as the company has opened branches faster than ever, its average revenue has dropped year by year, and by more than a fifth overall.</p> <p>In a world where valuing your own property is easy, thanks to all the online price data for comparable homes; and in a city where demand for housing drastically outstrips supply \u2013 where your scruffy Hackney terrace would probably sell if you just stuck a note in the window \u2013 the Foxtons model may not be sustainable in the long term. \u201cThey have always charged a premium [commission] for sales and lettings,\u201d said Gavin Jago, a property analyst at the brokers Peel Hunt. \u201cOnline estate agents are starting to charge considerably less.\u201d The rising online firm Purplebricks.com currently charges a maximum of \u00a31,158 to sell a London home \u2013 less than a tenth of Foxtons\u2019 average commission. Some senior estate agents outside Foxtons predict that, over the next decade, the market share of online firms will grow from a thirtieth to as much as half.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>When a scruffy Hackney terrace will sell with a note stuck in the window, the Foxtons model may not be sustainable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet sharks never stop swimming. In April, on the same weekend as the window-smashing in Brixton, I visited another Foxtons, a brand new branch in Bromley, on the more sedate fringes of south London. It was a cold dark Sunday, not house-hunting weather, and every other estate agent I passed in the suburb\u2019s grey centre was closed. But Foxtons selects its new markets with what it calls \u201cgranular\u201d attention to local sales and lettings data, and increasingly sees its future in more affordable outer London. For all the company\u2019s provocatively prosperous image, last year the average price it secured for a property was \u00a3544,000, only \u00a330,000 above the value of the average London home.</p> <p>The Bromley branch was deserted except for two staff, both sleekly dressed young women, and neat rows of paper bags, each containing a flyer for the branch and a chocolate muffin. One of the women would spend the next few hours doggedly handing out the bags, bare-legged in the wind, to hundreds of passersby. I asked how business was going. \u201cIt\u2019s 0% commission on the first hundred houses,\u201d she said, with a rigidly eager smile. \u201cWe\u2019ve already done 25 valuations.\u201d</p> <p>There was already a Foxtons in nearby Beckenham. What if, I asked, a property came on the market midway between the two branches? Which one would deal with the seller and any buyers? She instantly turned deadpan: \u201cIt depends on who they call first.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a></p>",
