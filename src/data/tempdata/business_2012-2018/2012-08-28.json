With no increase in the interim dividend for the first time since G4S was created in 2004 via the merger of Group 4 Falck and Securicor. There is an explanation of sorts. G4S's earnings per share, even when nasties such as the \u00a350m Olympics hit are ignored, were static in the first half of this year. And, since the company's policy is to increase dividends \"broadly in line\" with earnings, there is logic in taking the literal-minded approach that shareholders should live on the same rations as a year ago. On the other hand, Buckles painted a picture of a business that, apart from its Olympic calamity, is bristling with confidence. G4S says \"organic\" growth in revenue was 5% last year and 10% outside Europe and the US; it sees \"many growth opportunities\" ahead. Such bold statements usually encourage managements to \"borrow\" a little from the future to keep the dividend moving forward. Not in this case. The truth may be that G4S understands anything could happen. It will be six months \u2013 at least \u2013 before management knows whether its ability to win contracts, especially in the UK, is damaged. Even then, G4S will have to live with the reality that the firm's reputation is one more cock-up away from meltdown. For the time being, Buckles will probably survive. It's a fair bet the board will conclude next month that mistakes were made with the Olympics contract but lessons have been learned. But shareholders should be nervous. A year ago, the chief executive wanted to bet the balance sheet on a \u00a35.2bn bid for ISS, a big Danish rival. It was an absurdly ambitious deal that was shot down by shareholders. The idea looked \u2013 then and now \u2013 like an attempt to escape slowing markets in the west. Now, to compound the problem, cash must be thrown at any contract that threatens further reputational damage. City analysts still see G4S resuming 10%-plus dividend growth in a year's time.

      "bodyText": "Spanish banks lost \u20ac1 out of every \u20ac20 deposited with them in July, making it the worst month for deposit flight in 15 years as rumours grew that the country is edging closer to a full bailout. News that banks were losing deposits came as Spain's statistics institute revealed the current recession is worse than thought, with the economy shrinking at an annual rate of 1.3% in the second quarter. \"The downturn in the Spanish economy is deeper than previously thought and accelerating,\" warned Robert O'Daly of the Economist Intelligence Unit. Against this background, European Council president Herman Van Rompuy said it was up to Spain to decide whether to seek eurozone help, after meeting prime minister Mariano Rajoy in Madrid. Rajoy repeated that he needed more details from the European Central Bank to help him decide. Tuesday's revised figures showed recession started three months earlier than previously indicated. \"The data shows the recession started in the third quarter of last year,\" secretary for state for the economy, Fernando Jim\u00e9nez admitted. A collapse in internal consumption in a country squeezed by government austerity and massive unemployment is largely to blame for the recession, as this fell at an annual rate of 3.9% in the second quarter. Unemployment is already at 25% but the speed at which jobs are being destroyed quickened to an average rate of 800,000 jobs a year in the second quarter, according to the statistics institute. That helps explain why Spaniards, and their companies, are both reducing spending and putting less money in the bank. Sources at the Bank of Spain claimed the sudden drop in the amount on deposit was mostly due to banks withdrawing money placed with other entities, but the fall came amid growing consumer anger with retail banks. Tens of thousands of small savers are set to be hit with losses on preference shares they bought in former savings banks that now need bailing out by the eurozone's rescue fund. Spanish banks can take up to \u20ac100bn (\u00a379.7bn) from the fund, but preference shareholders must first bear losses of up to 80%. Many savers who bought the shares thought they were risk-free deposits from high street banks. A new law due to be passed on Friday should settle their part of the bill for a banking crisis whose origins lie in the residential housing bubble that burst four years ago. The new law should also set up a state \"bad bank\" to absorb toxic real estate \u2013 largely worthless building land and unsold new properties \u2013 that forced the nationalisation of several banks. Attempts to stave off a full bailout took a blow on Tuesday when the regional government of Catalonia said it needed \u20ac5bn from a central government rescue fund. Catalonia is one of half a dozen regional governments shut out of markets and needing government help to roll over debt and fund budget deficits. Regions have a combined debt of \u20ac145bn, with \u20ac36bn needing refinancing this year. A report by the Fedea thinktank predicts Catalonia \u2013 which accounts for one fifth of the economy \u2013 will miss the 1.5% deficit target set this year, with an expected 2.5% deficit making it the second worst performing region. Rajoy's conservative central government may eventually take direct control of the region's finances. Regional prime minister Artur Mas, of the Catalan nationalist Convergence and Union coalition, has threatened a snap election if that happens. His spokesman, Francesc Homs, rejected any \"political terms\" for borrowing the money. But as Spain pinned its hopes for avoiding a full bailout on future bond-buying by the European Central Bank, not all news was bad. On Tuesday it managed to borrow \u20ac3.6bn for three and six months at much lower rates than in recent auctions. Exports continue to grow, while unit labour costs fell 2% \u2013 signs that a gradual internal devaluation may be happening. Spain, meanwhile, has enjoyed a summer tourist boom, which generated 9% more income this July than a year earlier.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer said on Tuesday that the latest poll of confidence among its shoppers had delivered its most positive score in more than two years, providing some good news for its embattled chief executive, Marc Bolland. The high street chain is regarded as a barometer of consumer spending and its authoritative monthly poll involves interviews with 4,000 customers. M&amp;S's director of customer insight and loyalty, Steve Bond, said the latest reading for the four weeks to 17 August was 12 points higher than a year ago. Optimism was riding high, he said, thanks to the feelgood effect of events such as the Olympics, although he cautioned that the poll, launched by Bolland in May 2010, had only ever been conducted in a downturn. The \"most subdued group\" in the marketplace remained families battling higher food and fuel prices, added Bond. In its annual results in May, Bolland blamed the weak economic backdrop for disappointing sales at the retailer and his decision to scale back ambitious growth targets. Its deteriorating performance has become a source of concern for investors after like-for-like sales of clothing and homewares tumbled nearly 7% in the first quarter \u2013 the worst figures in three years. Last year, Bolland poached Tesco high-flyer Laura Wade-Gery to oversee its e-commerce operation with the job of doubling internet sales to \u00a31bn by 2014. Speaking for the first time about her role, Wade-Gery said the business was on track to hit the target set for her division. \"M&amp;S is putting more money behind this than I had at Tesco,\" she added, signalling M&amp;S's ambition to become an international multichannel retailer. Wade-Gery spent 14 years at the rival firm, latterly running tesco.com. M&amp;S is spending \u00a3150m building a new platform to replace its existing website, which is run by Amazon, and another \u00a3100m on gadgets to encourage increasingly tech-savvy shoppers to spend more time in its stores. Wade-Gery has already launched a gamut of technology initiatives, including areas described as \"digital lounges\" in a handful of stores where customers can use iPads to browse fashions not available on the shopfloor.

Morgan Stanley believes the product will continue to boost the division's earnings, with only a third of its sales now accounted for by the tablet form:</p> <blockquote> We think that Reckitt's pharma business will continue to drive growth at accretive margins through a combination of (i) developing the US market; (ii) international opportunities, as illustrated by Australia; and (iii) long-term, it has the track record to enter further addiction management fields. <br> Should Reckitt retain the business, our discounted cashflow valuation indicates a value of some \u00a32.6bn, whereas transaction multiples in generic pharmaceuticals implies a theoretical valuation range of \u00a33bn to \u00a35 bn. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Reckitt has ended its partnership with <strong>Futura Medical</strong> for erectile dysfunction products, a condom known as CSD500 and a gel called MED2002. The relationship was originally between Futura and Durex-owner SSL, a business subsequently taken over by Reckitt. Futura said they had been unable to reach common ground acceptable to both parties in respect of the continued development and commercialisation of the products. Futura chief executive James Barder remained positive, saying:</p> <blockquote> We have received considerable interest in CSD500 from potential marketing partners [and] are therefore confident of relicensing the product on attractive commercial terms and of creating significant value for shareholders. </blockquote> <p>But Futura's shares fell 11p to 47.5p, while Reckitt rose 6p to \u00a336.21.</p> <p>Overall, leading shares were virtually unchanged after the long bank holiday weekend and ahead of the Jefferson Hole annual US Federal Reserve meeting, with investors hoping Fed boss Ben Bernanke will pull something out of the hat to help the world's largest economy.

      "bodyText": "Reckitt Benckiser's pharmaceutical business could be worth up to \u00a35bn if it were sold off, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley, despite competition worries surrounding its suboxone heroin substitute. The company, best known for its Cillit Bang and Vanish household goods products, has introduced a film version of suboxone to counter generic rivals to the tablet form. Morgan Stanley believes the product will continue to boost the division's earnings, with only a third of its sales now accounted for by the tablet form: We think that Reckitt's pharma business will continue to drive growth at accretive margins through a combination of (i) developing the US market; (ii) international opportunities, as illustrated by Australia; and (iii) long-term, it has the track record to enter further addiction management fields. Should Reckitt retain the business, our discounted cashflow valuation indicates a value of some \u00a32.6bn, whereas transaction multiples in generic pharmaceuticals implies a theoretical valuation range of \u00a33bn to \u00a35 bn. Meanwhile Reckitt has ended its partnership with Futura Medical for erectile dysfunction products, a condom known as CSD500 and a gel called MED2002. The relationship was originally between Futura and Durex-owner SSL, a business subsequently taken over by Reckitt. Futura said they had been unable to reach common ground acceptable to both parties in respect of the continued development and commercialisation of the products. Futura chief executive James Barder remained positive, saying: We have received considerable interest in CSD500 from potential marketing partners [and] are therefore confident of relicensing the product on attractive commercial terms and of creating significant value for shareholders. But Futura's shares fell 11p to 47.5p, while Reckitt rose 6p to \u00a336.21. Overall, leading shares were virtually unchanged after the long bank holiday weekend and ahead of the Jefferson Hole annual US Federal Reserve meeting, with investors hoping Fed boss Ben Bernanke will pull something out of the hat to help the world's largest economy.

The court must rule on German plaintiffs' claim that legislation to establish the ESM would violate Germany's <em>Grundgesetz</em> (basic law). If the court rules in the plaintiffs' favour, it will ask the president, Joachim Gauck, not to sign the ESM treaty, which has already been ratified by Germany's parliament.</p> <p>There are serious concerns on all sides about the pending decision. Investors are worried that the court could oppose the ESM such that they would have to bear the losses from their bad investments. Taxpayers and pensioners in European countries that still have solid economies are worried that the court could pave the way for socialisation of eurozone debt, saddling them with the burden of these same investors' losses.</p> <p>The plaintiffs represent the entire political spectrum, including the Left party, the Christian Social Union MP Peter Gauweiler, and the justice minister in former chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's Social Democratic government, Herta D\u00e4ubler-Gmelin, who has collected tens of thousands of signatures supporting her case. There is also a group of retired professors of economics and law, and another of \"ordinary\" citizens, whose individual complaints have been selected as examples by the court.</p> <p>The plaintiffs have raised several objections to the ESM. First, they claim that it breaches the Maastricht Treaty's \"no bailout\" clause (Article 125). Germany agreed to relinquish the Deutsche Mark on the condition that the new currency area would not lead to direct or indirect socialisation of its members' debt, thus precluding any financial assistance from EU funds for states facing bankruptcy. Indeed, the new currency was conceived as a unit of account for economic exchange that would not have any wealth implications at all.</p> <p>The plaintiffs argue that, in the case of Greece, breaching Article 125 required proof that its insolvency would pose a greater danger than anticipated when the Maastricht Treaty was drafted. However, no such proof was provided.</p> <p>Second, Germany's law on the introduction of the ESM obliges Germany's representative on the ESM council to vote only after having asked the Bundestag for a decision. According to the plaintiffs, this is not permissible under international law. If Germany had wished to constrain its governor's authority in this way, it should have informed the other signatory states prior to doing so. On the other hand, Germany's representative on the governing council is sworn to secrecy, which, the plaintiffs argue, precludes any accountability to the Bundestag.</p> <p>Moreover, the plaintiffs claim that, while the ESM treaty is restrictive in granting resources to individual states, requiring a qualified majority vote, it does not specify the conditions under which losses are acceptable. Losses can result from excessive wages paid by the ESM governing council members to themselves, a dearth of energy in efforts to collect debts from countries that have received credit, or other forms of mismanagement. And, because governing council and executive board members enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution, misbehaviour cannot be punished.</p> <p>If losses arise, they must be covered by the initial cash contribution of \u20ac80bn (\u00a363bn), which then would be topped up automatically by all participating countries according to their capital shares. If individual countries are no longer able to make the necessary contributions, others must do so on their behalf. In principle, a single country might have to assume the entire burden of losses. Such joint and several liability, the plaintiffs assert, contradicts the court's previous statements that Germany should not accept any financial commitments stemming from other states' behaviour.</p> <p>Worse, according to the plaintiffs, although the liability of any country vis-a-vis external partners is limited to that country's share of capital, this limitation does not apply to other signatory states. It is theoretically possible that a single country could be held liable for the ESM's total exposure of \u20ac700bn.</p> <p>Finally, the ESM cannot be considered on its own, but must be seen in the context of the total exposure amount, which includes the \u20ac1.4tn in bailout funds that have already been granted. In particular, the Target2 credit drawn by the crisis-afflicted countries' central banks, which already totals almost \u20ac1tn, should also be taken into consideration.</p> <p>Nobody knows how the constitutional court will rule on these objections. Most observers believe that the court is unlikely to oppose the ESM treaty, though many expect the judges to demand certain amendments, or to ask Germany's president to make his signature subject to certain qualifications.</p> <p>It is good that the court's decisions cannot be forecast, and even better that the court cannot be lobbied or petitioned. The European Union can be based only on the rule of law. If those in power can break its rules on a case-by-case basis, the EU will never develop into the stable construct that is a prerequisite for peace and prosperity.</p>",

Losses can result from excessive wages paid by the ESM governing council members to themselves, a dearth of energy in efforts to collect debts from countries that have received credit, or other forms of mismanagement. And, because governing council and executive board members enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution, misbehaviour cannot be punished. If losses arise, they must be covered by the initial cash contribution of \u20ac80bn (\u00a363bn), which then would be topped up automatically by all participating countries according to their capital shares. If individual countries are no longer able to make the necessary contributions, others must do so on their behalf. In principle, a single country might have to assume the entire burden of losses. Such joint and several liability, the plaintiffs assert, contradicts the court's previous statements that Germany should not accept any financial commitments stemming from other states' behaviour. Worse, according to the plaintiffs, although the liability of any country vis-a-vis external partners is limited to that country's share of capital, this limitation does not apply to other signatory states. It is theoretically possible that a single country could be held liable for the ESM's total exposure of \u20ac700bn. Finally, the ESM cannot be considered on its own, but must be seen in the context of the total exposure amount, which includes the \u20ac1.4tn in bailout funds that have already been granted. In particular, the Target2 credit drawn by the crisis-afflicted countries' central banks, which already totals almost \u20ac1tn, should also be taken into consideration. Nobody knows how the constitutional court will rule on these objections. Most observers believe that the court is unlikely to oppose the ESM treaty, though many expect the judges to demand certain amendments, or to ask Germany's president to make his signature subject to certain qualifications. It is good that the court's decisions cannot be forecast, and even better that the court cannot be lobbied or petitioned. The European Union can be based only on the rule of law. If those in power can break its rules on a case-by-case basis, the EU will never develop into the stable construct that is a prerequisite for peace and prosperity.",
