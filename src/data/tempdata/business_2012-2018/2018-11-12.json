      "bodyText": "The share price of Interserve has plunged to its lowest point in more than 30 years, as concerns mounted over its finances. The Reading-based construction company\u2019s shares closed down by more than 10% on Monday to 39p, as investors digested an update from Renewi. Last week, the waste-to-product manufacturer said Interserve had missed a deadline on a joint venture in Derby that aims to produce energy from waste. Renewi, in its half-year report, said there had been \u201csignificant progress\u201d on the Derby plant, but added that Interserve had not completed construction work by the end of September. Interserve had planned for the facility to be fully operational by spring this year. Investors now fear it may be forced to set aside more cash in compensation, even though the company had said it was confident the delay would not be meaningful financially. Some City analysts fear Interserve will have to issue new shares to raise money. The company, which also carries out cleaning services for schools, hospitals and government departments across the UK, agreed a \u00a3300m rescue plan in March, at a time of pressure on the outsourcing and construction sector that prompted the collapse of Carillion at the start of the year. Interserve has also attracted significant interest from short sellers betting its share price would fall. BrightSphere Investment raised its short position to 2.5% of outstanding shares in Interserve at the start of November, according to data reported to the Financial Conduct Authority. Interserve tried to downplay the delay at the Derby plant, where testing has been continuing since July 2017. \u201cWe continue to make progress on the Derby energy from waste project and can confirm that the construction completion certificate has been achieved. The plant is operational and already receiving waste, and we continue to commission the plant in readiness for handover,\u201d a spokesperson said. The Derby facility has been hoping to divert up to 98% of the waste not recycled by residents from landfill into productive uses, while generating enough electricity to power as many as 14,000 homes. However, it has been plagued by delays. Shares in Interserve are now worth about \u00a360m, down by more than 90% in five years.",

Sterling fell a little on Monday morning but the instinct to celebrate anything that looks like \u201cprogress\u201d towards an agreed deal returned in the afternoon when Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, was reported to have said the main elements of an exit treaty are ready. One might say the market\u2019s gentle to-and-fro is exactly what you\u2019d expect. Investors are as confused as everybody else about the eventual outcome. And so they cling to the idea, which has been the consensus opinion for about a year, that some form of grand fudge will prevail in the end and that an orderly Brexit will happen next March. Yet, if you believe the parliamentary arithmetic is against May, investors should be pricing up alternative outcomes right now. For a start, the odds on a chaotic no-deal exit should be shorter. True, there is also no parliamentary majority for that result, but accidents happen \u2013 and the result of this kind of accident might be a 15% fall in sterling. And the odds on a second referendum \u2013 the third horse in the race, as it were \u2013 should surely also be shorter. If another referendum, or a people\u2019s vote, were to produce a majority for staying in the European Union, sterling might currently be undervalued by, say, 10%. So do you buy or sell? That\u2019s the tricky bit, of course. It\u2019s one thing to say the pound appears mispriced at $1.29 against the dollar. It\u2019s another to predict which direction it will go. But the potential for big swings in sterling sets up an interesting dynamic because currency markets probably won\u2019t be so becalmed when the final action starts in parliament. A falling pound, which is clearly possible if May\u2019s difficulties are as deep as they look, is the interesting scenario. Would the government be able to re-heat a version of \u201cproject fear\u201d to rally support behind even an inadequate deal? Would the campaign for a second referendum gain momentum as a way to restore some order and buy time for a rethink? May has defied upsets to get to this point and one should never overestimate the power of markets to influence political events. Even so, sterling is her other potential headache. The combination of a unpalatable deal and a plunging pound could prove toxic for a weak prime minister. Smoky (re)treat For almost 20 years, tobacco companies were near-perfect stocks for investors who don\u2019t care about killing customers. Legal headaches, which seemed catastrophic in the mid-1990s, went away soon afterwards with a grand settlement of US healthcare liabilities. Cashflows were magnificent, since nobody launches cigarette companies these days. Consolidation produced lovely cost savings. You could have bought shares in British American Tobacco (BAT) at close to 400p at the turn of the century and sold at \u00a355 in May last year. Now the price has slipped below \u00a330 and the source of the latest 11% fall is not the rise of vaping. Rather it\u2019s the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s attempt to ban menthol cigarettes. This proposal might sound innocuous but would be a very big deal for BAT since menthol gaspers are estimated to account for about a quarter of its annual profits. The FDA argues that menthol varieties are more dangerous because they are less irritating to the lungs but do the same damage. The companies will throw lawyers at the threat but you\u2019d back the regulator to win in the end. It has reason on its side. For BAT investors, and the board, it\u2019s a moment to regret the firm\u2019s huge takeover last year of the outstanding 58% of Reynolds, the firm behind Newport, the top-selling US menthol brand. But they cannot claim they were misled since the menthol debate was alive even at the time. Tough. It was just a bad deal at the top of the market.",

      "bodyText": "Some of the UK\u2019s biggest retailers are taking a break from the frantic buildup to Christmas this week for \u201cPurple Tuesday\u201d, the first national day dedicated to the needs of disabled shoppers. Asda, Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury\u2019s are among more than 700 businesses \u2013 after an initial target of only 50 \u2013 who had joined the initiative by Monday morning. Companies are required to make at least one long-term commitment to improve the experience of disabled customers in order to take part. The event was founded by Mike Adams, the chief executive of Purple, a not-for-profit organisation that campaigns for businesses to be more inclusive and to do more to allow people to spend the so-called \u201cpurple pound\u201d. Purple estimates British people with disabilities spend \u00a3249bn a year on retail and leisure, but many disabled people feel ill-served on the high street, a particularly acute issue as the move to online shopping leaves bricks-and-mortar retailers struggling. Adams said he wants the event to \u201cdemonstrate to retailers that there are things that can be done at no cost\u201d and to \u201cstart some momentum for businesses to see disabled people as, first and foremost, customers\u201d. The organisation is encouraging firms to give staff training, to conduct accessibility audits in physical stores and on websites, and to appoint internal \u201cdisability champions\u201d to raise issues in the future at board level for big firms \u2013 alongside a day of festooning stores and mannequins in the purple colour, which has become a signature of the disability rights movement. Some of the largest shopping centre owners across the UK will also participate, with Landsec\u2019s Bluewater in Kent and Hammerson\u2019s Bullring in Birmingham among those taking part in events to mark the day. Purple Tuesday takes place in the run-up to the crucial Christmas period, when retailers are focused on raising footfall and web traffic through US-inspired events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. However, Purple and the companies participating are aiming for an impact beyond a single day of publicity. Alexander Nicoll, the corporate responsibility director at Intu, which runs centres such as the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Essex\u2019s Lakeside, said: \u201cDisability issues have gone up everybody\u2019s agenda.\u201d He hopes the event will prompt more lasting change. \u201cOur ethos is that we shouldn\u2019t be doing anything on Purple Tuesday that we\u2019re not doing every other day of the year,\u201d he said. Other initiatives encouraged by the campaign include \u201cquiet hours\u201d in stores that aim to make shopping easier for people with autism, more easily navigable stores and better parking facilities, which could come under strain as more disabled people are attracted to the shops. The campaign also aims to raise awareness of less visible disabilities. There are 11 million disabled people in the UK but fewer than one in 10 use wheelchairs, according to government figures.",

      "bodyText": "And finally... here\u2019s Adam Vaughan on the prospect of an Opec production cut: The euro has sunk as low as $1.124 against the US dollar today, the weakest since June 2017. Bart Hordijk, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, blames \u201cfour apocalyptic horseman\u201d: \u201cBrexit, Italy, slower growth and a cautious European Central Bank are the four apocalyptic horsemen currently chasing the euro to its doom - well, at least to a 17-month low against the dollar.\u201d UK military equipment manufacturer Babcock has launched a counter-attack of its own today. Babcock has denied being in financial trouble, and accused an analyst group of spreading \u201cfalse and malicious\u201d. More here: Here\u2019s the full story on the potential US menthol cigarette crackdown: Oil analyst Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix argues that Saudi Arabia is right to be considering output cuts in 2019 (on top of the planned reduction in December). He says (via Reuters): \u201cThe balances for 2019 do show, especially in the first half of the year, that there will be significant global oversupply,\u201d Donald Trump might not be best-pleased by the prospect of Opec cutting production in 2019. The US president has been lobbying the cartel to raise production, to avoid gasoline prices rising in America. Last week he declared, with typical modesty: \u201cIf you look at oil prices they\u2019ve come down very substantially over the last couple of months. \u201cThat\u2019s because of me.\u201d In a sense Trump is right -- oil had risen because America imposed tough new sanctions on Iran. But Washington then granted a waiver to eight countries -- China, India, Greece, Italy, Taiwan, Japan, Turkey and South Korea -- allowing them to keep buying Iranian crude. This helped pull the oil price back down again, as Iran\u2019s stocks were effectively back on the market. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst ActivTrades, agrees that the pound is being hit by political instability (again): Cable [the \u00a3/$ exchange rate] is down almost 1% on the day, in what appears to be a reaction to reports pointing to Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s inability to gather the necessary support within her cabinet for a Brexit deal. As the struggle within the British camp intensifies, so does the chance of a no deal Brexit and perhaps of an earlier general election. Both scenarios present more downside risk for sterling. After a positive start, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has now dipped into the red - joining the other major European indices. Tobacco stocks have been hit by reports that the US might ban menthol cigarettes; British American Tobacco has slumped 9%, with Imperial Brands down 4%. Mining stocks and oil producers are up, though. BP and Royal Dutch Shell have both gained over 1.5%, on the prospect of an Opec production cut pushing up prices. The pound is on track for its worst day in almost two months.... Former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has warned that the world is not well placed to deal with the next financial crisis. Phillip Inman, the Observer\u2019s economics editor, reports: Politicians and central bankers will be denied the tools they used in 2008 when the next financial crisis hits the global economy, Gordon Brown said this morning, arguing that governments will need to respond by increasing debt levels and taxes even more than they did last time round. The high levels of cooperation among senior policymakers across the world seen a decade ago have largely disappeared, which is a damaging situation when the global economy will need a strong fiscal stimulus following the next financial crash top avoid a slump. Speaking at a TUC conference to discuss the implications of the financial crisis, the former UK prime minister and an architect of the global cooperation a decade ago, said the four pillars to the 2008 rescue were no longer in place. Brown pointed out that: The G20 no longer represents global economic power in the way it was in 2008. The rise of protectionism is already restricting trade and undermining the free trade needed to boost all nations following a crisis. Central banks are not able to provide a monetary stimulus through cuts in interest rates; this is likely to still be the case many years from now. Governments have denied themselves room to provide a stimulus through a misguided focus on high levels of debt and the use of taxpayer funds. He said: \u201cWhen you have a Keynesian problem, it needs a Keynesian response.\u201d, adding: \u201cYou cannot talk about a globally managed system. The Financial Stability Board has no power, it can only urge change, it is only by invocation that it can try to bring countries to change their policies. The G7 was out of date in 2008 and was superseded by the G20, Brown said, adding that the G20 is out of date. \u201cSo the decision-making framework for the next 10 years will need to be different to the one for the last 10 years.\u201d He rejected proposals gaining popularity on the left in the US for a form of \u201cresponsible nationalism\u201d that recommends pulling back from global coordination in favour of addressing national economic problems of stagnant wages and living standards. He said unilateral action would fail and only a global leadership could rescue economies from a financial crisis. Sterling is having a bad morning as Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plans take another pummelling. The pound has slumped by 1.5 cents this morning to $1.283, its lowest level since November 1, in the face of yet more bad headlines for the PM. May is still struggling to agree the terms of a Brexit agreement that is acceptable to both hardline eurosceptics in her party and those who supported Remain, and favour a soft exit. So we have former foreign secretary Boris Johnson aghast that the EU might still have control of Britain after Brexit, and on the other hand former education secretary Justine Greening warning that parliament should block the plan because Britain will lose vital influence and credibility otherwise. The government still hasn\u2019t squared the Irish backstop circle either, meaning Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP is still threatening to pull their crucial support. The opposition Labour party aren\u2019t doing much better either, with shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer arguing that the whole thing can be stopped -- something leader Jeremy Corbyn doesn\u2019t accept. This has left City traders despairing, rolling their eyes, and selling both the pound and the euro.... Neil Wilson of Markets.com points out that any official oil output cut will require co-operation between Opec members, and Russia too. As mentioned earlier, Moscow may not be persuaded that they should cut production to get the oil price up again. He writes: \u201cSaudi Arabia has announced a cut to December crude output, a sign that it\u2019s prepared to curb production to stem the decline in oil prices. The country will pump 500,000 barrels a day fewer next month than it has been in November Brent rallied from 7-month lows at just above $69 to trade above $71.50. Having found support at $59.30, US crude has firmed to $61 but is struggling hold that handle. In the short term this is a positive for oil, but we must question the impact longer term unless it\u2019s the sign of more to come from OPEC. Saudi Arabia cannot act alone though \u2013 realistically it needs to pull together OPEC allies and, critically, Russia to curb production if it wants prices to hold. The language from Russia suggests it is not ready to follow the Saudis yet. In other energy news, UK power station operator Drax is facing a legal challenge today to its plans to build a new gas power station. My colleague Adam Vaughan explains: ClientEarth, which has repeatedly defeated the government in court over its air pollution strategy, has submitted an objection to the planning inspectorate over Drax Group\u2019s proposed 3.6GW plant in North Yorkshire. The intervention is the first by the lawyers against a gas project in the UK. Sam Hunter Jones, a lawyer at the group, said it had acted because the Drax scheme marked a tipping point in the amount of new gas planned by energy firms in the UK. The UK has already given planning approval for 15GW-worth of large-scale gas plants, including at Eggborough, which is not far from the Drax site. Adding the Drax project would take the total to about 18GW, three times the 6GW of new gas the government estimates the country will need up to 2035.... Economist Intelligence Unit analyst Peter Kiernan believes oil producers are reacting to signs of slowing economic demand, and America\u2019s growing shale oil industry. \u201cOPEC may decide to reduce output for 2019 based on concerns that, the loss of some Iranian supply notwithstanding, the fundamentals will weaken next year due to slower growth in consumption and strong performance in non-OPEC supply, led by US shale. In June, Opec states and Russia agreed to increase output to keep the market in balance, but now they face the possibility of having to wind some of this growth back. Russia isn\u2019t a member of Opec, although it did attend last weekend\u2019s Opec+ meeting. And Russia may also need convincing that production cuts are needed. The head of Moscow-based Lukoil has argued that the current oil price is \u201cfairly high\u201d According to the RIA news agency, Vagit Alekperov has predicted the oil price will remain at its current levels until the end of 2018, and then stick between $70 and $75 per barrel next year. In other words - why cut production? More news flashes from the oil ministers meeting in Abu Dhabi: Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih has succeeded in pushing oil higher: Oil has firmly entered in a bear territory and the recent comments from the Saudi oil minister may actually support the market. The minister has said that Saudi Arabia sees need to cut 1mb/d from October level. We are seeing investors taking advantage of the overselling of the oil price in the recent weeks and a corrective move is strongly on the card. The current momentum could push the oil price towards the $62.50 and a break of this would open the floor towards the next resistance of $63.20. This talk about crude production cuts comes just days after oil plunged into a bear market. As this chart shows, the cost of US crude has fallen by over 20% since the start of October, from $76 per barrel to just $60. Newsflash: Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister is speaking to the press again this morning, and dropping further hints that production will be reined in. Khalid Al-Falih confirmed that Saudi will pump half a million barrels less in December, due to falling demand. He then cites technical analysis, which apparently shows that production should actually be cut by one million barrels per day [global demand is close to 100m barrels/day] Al-Falih then declares that oil ministers from Opec and beyond agreed yesterday that they must do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to balance the market (ie, stop prices falling). A Kuwaiti official has now confirmed that Opec and non-Opec members talked about possibly cutting oil supplies in 2019, at their meeting yesterday. Reuters has the details: A meeting of major oil exporters in Abu Dhabi has \u201cdiscussed a proposal for some kind of cut in (crude) supply next year\u201d, state-run Kuwait News Agency KUNA on Monday cited a Kuwaiti oil official as saying. It said the proposal did not specify the volume of the cut, according to Kuwait\u2019s governor to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Haitham Al-Ghais. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price is rallying this morning after Saudi Arabia announced that it would cut oil production next month, by half a million barrels per day. That\u2019s being taken as a sign that oil cartel Opec could announce a co-ordinated cut at its December meeting, in a bid to prop up prices. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih told reporters on Sunday in Abu Dhabi that: \u201cWe as responsible producers are going to work, and work hard, to balance the market within a reasonable corridor,\u201d Al-Falih argued that demand for Saudi oil was \u201ctapering off\u201d due to seasonal factors, meaning the world\u2019s largest oil producer should ship less. Al-Falih was speaking at a joint meeting of Opec and non-Opec oil ministers, and markets have been quick to take the hint: Brent crude has jumped by almost 2% this morning to $71.55 per barrel, while New York crude is 1.3% higher at $61/barrel. That follows weeks of steady falls - Brent crude was trading over $86 per barrel at the start of October, before fears of a global growth slowdown took hold. Higher oil prices will help the Saudi\u2019s balance their budgets, at a time when Riyadh remains under heavy diplomatic pressure following the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. But it will be a blow to global consumers, pushing up petrol prices on the forecourt and transport costs generally. Stephen Innes of trading firm OANDA says oil is \u201cthe hottest topic\u201d in the markets today. The recent slide in prices are having far-reaching implications across all asset classes He believes next month\u2019s Opec meeting will be crucial: Oil prices above $80 are never welcome by OPEC customers, and that seems to be a similar consensus among OPEC+ and US producers. However, producers are concerned that the latest selling frenzy could see Brent oil reach $ 60 or below. So, it\u2019s in OPEC\u2019s best interest to tame the current supply glut.... But where oil prices are headed next, ultimately depends on the producers. Also coming up today The pound will be under pressure, as Theresa May continues to struggle to reach a Brexit deal. Time - never a commodity Italy will also be in focus, with new factory output data out this morning. Rome is still under pressure from Brussels to revise its 2019 budget, and still adamant that it won\u2019t. European stock markets are expected to rise by at least 0.5% at the open.

Speaking at a TUC conference to discuss the implications of the financial crisis, the former UK prime minister and an architect of the global cooperation a decade ago, said the four pillars to the 2008 rescue were no longer in place. </p> <p>Brown pointed out that:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The G20</strong> no longer represents global economic power in the way it was in 2008. <br></li> <li>The rise of protectionism is already restricting trade and undermining the<strong> free trade</strong> needed to boost all nations following a crisis. <br></li> <li><strong>Central banks</strong> are not able to provide a monetary stimulus through cuts in interest rates; this is likely to still be the case many years from now. <br></li> <li>Governments have denied themselves room to provide a stimulus through a <strong>misguided focus on high levels of debt</strong> and the use of taxpayer funds. <br></li> </ul> <p>He said: \u201cWhen you have a Keynesian problem, it needs a Keynesian response.\u201d, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cYou cannot talk about a globally managed system. The Financial Stability Board has no power, it can only urge change, it is only by invocation that it can try to bring countries to change their policies. </p> </blockquote> <p>The G7 was out of date in 2008 and was superseded by the G20, Brown said, adding that the G20 is out of date.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cSo the decision-making framework for the next 10 years will need to be different to the one for the last 10 years.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>He rejected proposals gaining popularity on the left in the US for a form of \u201cresponsible nationalism\u201d that recommends pulling back from global coordination in favour of addressing national economic problems of stagnant wages and living standards. <br> He said unilateral action would fail and only a global leadership could rescue economies from a financial crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TCarlen/status/1061922676363718656\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Great speech by Gordon Brown at the joint <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TUACOECD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TUACOECD</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/The_TUC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@The_TUC</a> conference in London.

      "bodyText": "Oil prices have staged a recovery, climbing above $70 a barrel after Saudi Arabia said the world\u2019s major crude producers agreed that supply needed to be cut significantly next year. The kingdom\u2019s energy minister, speaking after a meeting of Opec at the weekend, said the cartel believed that production would need to fall by nearly 1m barrels per day (bpd) on October levels. That would largely wipe out the 1m bpd increase the group agreed in June to try to rein in the price of oil. Khalid al-Falih\u2019s comments sparked a recovery in the price of international benchmark Brent crude, which rose to $70.83 a barrel and is on course for its biggest increase in a month. Crude prices hit four-year highs of more than $80 a barrel in late September and early October over fears of the impact of US sanctions on Iranian oil exports, triggering warnings of prices hitting $100. But the market has turned bearish in the past three weeks due to the US issuing sanction waivers for eight countries importing Iranian crude, record American production and forecasts of slowing demand. Falih said the US sanctions had removed less oil from the market than expected because of the waivers. \u201cSanctions didn\u2019t cut so much out of the market as anticipated,\u201d he added. The energy minister said: \u201cThere will need to be a reduction of supply from October levels approaching 1m barrels \u2026 The consensus is that we need to do whatever it takes to balance the market.\u201d Several analysts said oil prices were likely to turn bullish again. \u201cOil markets are significantly oversold in our view, and we remain convinced that both Brent and [US benchmark] WTI will rebound from their current bearish market mode,\u201d said analysts at MUFG bank. Bob Dudley, the chief executive of BP, said: \u201cWe can see the volatility \u2026 Opec has reduced production since June and quite frankly we would have been over $100 by now [without those cuts].\u201d He said the waivers had been unexpected, so the market had been readjusting. Speaking in Abu Dhabi, Dudley said Saudi Arabia\u2019s announcement would now \u201cprobably firm the price\u201d. Any formal decision on production cuts by Opec would probably come at its next meeting, in Vienna on 6 December.",

      "bodyText": "The British Airways owner, IAG, has been seeking Spanish government support to continue its operations in the case of a disorderly Brexit. According to letters reported in the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, Spain\u2019s government and Brussels doubt whether IAG can remain compliant with EU airline ownership rules. IAG has reportedly been in talks with Madrid since last month as it attempts to satisfy the EU over its status. Once its UK shareholders are stripped out after 29 March, IAG could fall below the 51% threshold for EU ownership, affecting most of its airlines, while BA could potentially also need to demonstrate it is British-owned, should some international aviation agreements be stringently applied. As well as BA, the Madrid-registered IAG owns the Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling, Ireland\u2019s Aer Lingus and a new European low-cost venture, Level. The airlines may need to prove that they are controlled within the EU. IAG\u2019s operational HQ is in Britain, near Heathrow airport. A spokesperson said IAG had no plans to move its management. The IAG chief executive, Willie Walsh, has long scorned predictions that the group would be in trouble, arguing that the way IAG had been established since the original 2011 BA-Iberia merger took account of complex international aviation agreements beyond the EU. He said reports earlier this year that a no-deal Brexit could jeopardise BA\u2019s transatlantic traffic, as EU-US bilateral deals fell apart, were \u201cnonsense\u201d. The group told investors it was confident it would continue to comply with relevant ownership and control regulations in the UK post-Brexit, but was having extensive engagement with relevant regulators to ensure its interests were protected. However, competitors, most vocally Ryanair\u2019s Michael O\u2019Leary, have claimed that IAGcould not survive Brexit in its current form. EasyJet has relocated many aircraft into the EU and set up easyJet Europe as a separate airline. IAG said: \u201cWe remain confident that a comprehensive air transport agreement between the EU and the UK will be reached. It\u2019s in the UK and the EU\u2019s interests to have a fully liberalised aviation agreement. Aviation liberalisation has been a great success story across Europe, benefiting 1bn customers each year and creating a huge number of jobs across the continent. \u201cEven if there is no Brexit deal, both the EU and the UK have said they will put an agreement in place that allows flights to continue.\u201d The UK transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said last month that the EU had yet to agree to talks to put a \u201cbare-bones\u201d aviation contingency deal in place to keep planes flying after 29 March next year.",

      "bodyText": "British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands have had \u00a38.6bn wiped off their stock market value as US regulators prepare to crack down on the sale of flavoured e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes. Shares in BAT, the sixth-biggest company in the FTSE 100 and maker of brands including Lucky Strike, Dunhill, Rothmans and Benson &amp; Hedges, fell by 10.6%, sending its market value plummeting from \u00a376bn at close on Friday to \u00a368bn at the end of trading on Monday. The tobacco company\u2019s share price has slumped by almost 40% over the past year, putting it on track for its third annual decline in the past two decades. The share price of Imperial Brands, the maker of products including Lambert &amp; Butler, Davidoff, Gauloises and John Player Special, dropped by more than 3%. The \u00a325bn company, the No 1 player in the UK market, had about \u00a3600m stripped from its market value. American tobacco companies also suffered. Philip Morris International, the manufacturer of the world\u2019s leading cigarette brand, Marlboro, and Altria Group, which runs Philip Morris brands including Marlboro in the US, were down by 1% and 1.9% respectively by lunchtime on the New York stock exchange. The US Food and Drug Administration will this week impose a ban on the sale of most flavoured e-cigarettes in tens of thousands of convenience stores and petrol stations across the US. The agency, which is trying to curb the huge increase in vaping among teenagers, will also bring in age-verification requirements for online sales. The FDA is proposing a ban on menthol cigarettes, which, although it could take up to two years to be finalised and enforced, would be a major blow for BAT. It sells Newport, one of the most popular menthol brands in the US, through its subsidiary Reynolds American, which BAT picked up following a $25bn (\u00a319.5bn) deal to buy Lorillard in 2015. US menthol sales account for about one-quarter of BAT\u2019s annual profit, according to analysts at Jefferies. About 15% of Imperial\u2019s profits come from menthol sales, while at Altria, the figure is about 15%. Owen Bennett, an analyst at Jefferies, said: \u201cIn terms of how much profit is at risk, though, we think it is way below this. \u201cWe think many will just switch into a non-menthol variant of their brand versus quitting, or, given the availability of reduced-risk products, will now switch into one of these. The question is then, can the majors take their fair share of those switching?\u201d E-cigarette products in mint, menthol and tobacco flavours will still be sold in retail outlets in the US for now because officials did not want to create a situation where cigarettes were more attractive to smokers who prefer a mint or menthol flavour. In 2013 the FDA concluded menthol cigarettes are harder to give up and pose a greater health risk than regular cigarettes. Last week, the Imperial Brands chief executive, Alison Cooper, told investors the company was targeting ambitious growth in \u201cnext-generation products\u201d. Nicholas Hyett, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cAn ever more hostile regulatory environment might explain why BAT has decided to spend big on products like e-vapour and heated tobacco. \u201cThese products are believed to cause less harm to users, but even here the regulator is creating waves, potentially banning flavoured capsules popular with younger customers.\u201d In June, voters in San Francisco approved a proposition to ban the sale of flavoured tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, with RJ Reynolds, a subsidiary of Reynolds American, contributing $12m to try to prevent the ban. Last year, BAT re-entered the US market after a 12-year absence with the $47bn acquisition of Reynolds, which owns brands including Camel, in a move that created the world\u2019s biggest tobacco company and was expected to speed up the development of e-cigarettes and vapes.",

      "body": "<p>British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands have had \u00a38.6bn wiped off their stock market value as US regulators prepare to crack down on the sale of flavoured e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes.</p> <p>Shares in BAT, the sixth-biggest company in the FTSE 100 and maker of brands including Lucky Strike, Dunhill, Rothmans and Benson &amp; Hedges, fell by 10.6%, sending its market value plummeting from \u00a376bn at close on Friday to \u00a368bn at the end of trading on Monday.</p> <p>The tobacco company\u2019s share price has slumped by almost 40% over the past year, putting it on track for its third annual decline in the past two decades.</p> <p>The share price of Imperial Brands, the maker of products including Lambert &amp; Butler, Davidoff, Gauloises and John Player Special, dropped by more than 3%. The \u00a325bn company, the No 1 player in the UK market, had about \u00a3600m stripped from its market value.</p> <p>American tobacco companies also suffered. Philip Morris International, the manufacturer of the world\u2019s leading cigarette brand, Marlboro, and Altria Group, which runs Philip Morris brands including Marlboro in the US, were down by 1% and 1.9% respectively by lunchtime on the New York stock exchange.</p> <p>The US Food and Drug Administration will this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/12/juul-vaping-ban-fda-youth-fears-e-cigarettes-\">impose a ban</a> on the sale of most flavoured e-cigarettes in tens of thousands of convenience stores and petrol stations across the US. The agency, which is trying to curb the huge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/02/e-cigarettes-vaping-study-teenagers-smoking-cigarettes\">increase in vaping</a> among teenagers, will also bring in age-verification requirements for online sales.</p> <p>The FDA is proposing a ban on menthol cigarettes, which, although it could take up to two years to be finalised and enforced, would be a major blow for BAT. It sells Newport, one of the most popular menthol brands in the US, through its subsidiary Reynolds American, which BAT picked up following a $25bn (\u00a319.5bn) deal to buy Lorillard in 2015.</p> <p>US menthol sales account for about one-quarter of BAT\u2019s annual profit, according to analysts at Jefferies. About 15% of Imperial\u2019s profits come from menthol sales, while at Altria, the figure is about 15%.</p> <p>Owen Bennett, an analyst at Jefferies, said: \u201cIn terms of how much profit is at risk, though, we think it is way below this.</p> <p>\u201cWe think many will just switch into a non-menthol variant of their brand versus quitting, or, given the availability of reduced-risk products, will now switch into one of these. The question is then, can the majors take their fair share of those switching?\u201d</p> <p>E-cigarette products in mint, menthol and tobacco flavours will still be sold in retail outlets in the US for now because officials did not want to create a situation where cigarettes were more attractive to smokers who prefer a mint or menthol flavour.</p> <p>In 2013 the FDA concluded menthol cigarettes are harder to give up and pose a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/08/menthol-cigarettes-to-be-banned-eu\">greater health risk</a> than regular cigarettes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last week, the Imperial Brands chief executive, Alison Cooper, told investors the company was <a href=\"https://www.investegate.co.uk/imperial-brands-plc/rns/final-results/201811060700034532G/\">targeting ambitious growth</a> in \u201cnext-generation products\u201d.</p> <p>Nicholas Hyett, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cAn ever more hostile regulatory environment might explain why BAT has decided to spend big on products like e-vapour and heated tobacco.</p> <p>\u201cThese products are believed to cause less harm to users, but even here the regulator is creating waves, potentially banning flavoured capsules popular with younger customers.\u201d</p> <p>In June, voters in San Francisco approved a proposition to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/08/san-francisco-vape-flavoured-tobacco-ban\">ban the sale</a> of flavoured tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, with RJ Reynolds, a subsidiary of Reynolds American, contributing $12m to <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/06/health/san-francisco-flavored-cigarettes-proposition-e/index.html\">try to prevent</a> the ban.</p> <p>Last year, BAT re-entered the US market after a 12-year absence with the $47bn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/21/british-american-tobacco-38bn-reynolds-american-merger\">acquisition of Reynolds</a>, which owns brands including Camel, in a move that created the world\u2019s biggest tobacco company and was expected to speed up the development of e-cigarettes and vapes.</p>",

The FTSE250 engineering services company has come under attack from Boatman Capital Research, which late last week published a report criticising the company\u2019s financial performance. Claims made by Boatman, which is not traceable on Companies House, include that Babcock drastically overpaid when it struck a \u00a31.6bn deal for Avincis, one of the world\u2019s largest providers of helicopters for search and rescue missions, in 2014. The report prompted Babcock to issue an unscheduled statement to investors denying the claims. \u201cBabcock is issuing this statement to address recent speculation following the release of a report by the anonymous and so far untraceable Boatman Capital,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis report included many false and malicious statements which the group strongly refutes. At the same time, the group continues to seek to discover who is behind Boatman Capital.\u201d The investor update also contained a statement from the UK government supporting Babcock, although it did not directly address the claim regarding delays and potential losses for Babcock on the Warrior light tank renewal programme. \u201cWe monitor the health of all of our strategic suppliers, including Babcock, and remain committed to working with them on a wide range of programmes,\u201d said a spokesman for the UK government. \u201cBabcock plays a key part in equipping our world leading armed forces and the MoD spent more than \u00a31.7bn with the company last year, supporting thousands of jobs across the nation.\u201d Babcock, which is the MoD\u2019s second largest supplier and is working on 128 contracts for the government, said the company \u201ccontinues to enjoy a healthy financial position\u201d. Boatman, whose website says it is \u201cguiding investors across troubled waters\u201d, first moved against Babcock in October, claiming the company had been \u201cburying bad news about its performance\u201d and that its leadership team was \u201cnot up to the job\u201d. Boatman also made claims about Babcock\u2019s Appledore shipyard in Devon, which the company announced would shut in March after it failed to find enough work to sustain the yard.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "What tells you most about a society is how it treats its poor and vulnerable, the UN special rapporteur on poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, told a packed public meeting held in the UK\u2019s poorest neighbourhood on Sunday. He said a wealthy country could decide to help all those who hit hard times, ensure that they don\u2019t slip through the net and are able to live a life of dignity: \u201cIt\u2019s a political choice.\u201d Alston was in Jaywick, a tiny village by the sea in the south-east corner of Essex. It has found itself at the top of official indices of deprivation since 2010, and in countless articles and TV documentaries has come to symbolise the kind of bleak and gaudy poverty fuelled by chronic economic neglect and social breakdown. The UN rapporteur heard an hour of often moving testimonies from local people describing their stories of being pitched into hardship and despair through what Alston called the \u201chuman condition\u201d: best-laid plans derailed by unexpected life-changing events such as serious illness, job loss or marriage breakdown. The clear message from this proudly patriotic area, with its Conservative-run council and Tory MP, was that in an age of austerity and spending cuts, the state was choosing not to help; instead it was stealthily withdrawing and casting people adrift with only an overstretched voluntary and charity sector to support them. Several themes resurfaced throughout: the stress and humiliation of poverty and debt, the loneliness and feelings of worthlessness that brought on suicidal thoughts and the \u201chostile environment\u201d of the benefits system and bureaucratic nightmare of universal credit. Erin, a former journalist from Colchester, described how birth defects had triggered a neurological collapse at the age of 30, a crisis that had rapidly escalated to the point where she and her family, once comfortably off, were now at risk of becoming destitute. \u201cSuddenly we were not a two-income middle-class family, we were living on disability benefit.\u201d Her partner had to give up his job as an NHS manager to care for her full-time. Then they were told by their landlord that he wanted them out in eight weeks as he needed to sell the house. Twelve years of paying rent on time counted for nothing: as soon as estate agents discovered they were on disability benefits they refused to even consider letting to them. \u201cI do not know where I will be putting my 12-year-old to bed soon. Will we be made homeless, because of my birth defects?\u201d she told the meeting. \u201cWe have paid our taxes, we are hard workers, we are active in the community ... and we face the real prospect of being made homeless.\u201d Steve, a former jobcentre worker, told how he was driven to the brink by the stress of living on the breadline and being unable to provide for his family. He ran up debt and they became reliant on handouts and food banks. At one point he felt so despairing he considered stepping in front of a speeding car. \u201cI thought, if I were to die no-one would miss me.\u201d Rob, a nurse from Clacton, had been struck by chronic illness and was on long-term sickness benefit. He spoke of the \u201cfailing\u201d disability system. He had been found \u201cfit for work\u201d by an official benefits assessor, despite presenting evidence from his GP and hospital consultant that he was unable to. Subsequently he was told he had to re-apply for his disability benefits. The claim took seven weeks to be processed, leaving him without any income. He had to rely on friends for handouts, and made trips to the food bank. \u201cIt makes you feel worthless. The whole thing is a disgrace.\u201d Alston told the meeting the testimonies reflected those he had heard throughout his two-week tour. Last week he visited Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Cardiff, Belfast and Bristol. His tour continues on Monday in London. On Friday he will issue his interim report on how far the UK government is meeting its international human rights commitments on the right to housing, food and a decent standard of living. Earlier, Alston had met the Rev Sean Fountain, minister at Pier Avenue Baptist church in Clacton, a few miles up the coast from Jaywick. \u201cPeople are in crisis,\u201d Fountain said, \u201cand there is very little in the way of support.\u201d Faith and community groups were picking up the pieces as local government, schools, and policing budgets shrank, he said. Volunteers from his church ran a drop-in centre, a small homeless project, and helped run a food bank. But in the face of rising poverty, homelessness and youth crime, it sometimes felt like an unequal battle. He said they got no financial help from the council \u201cand there are only so many volunteers to go round\u201d. Giles Watling, the Conservative MP for Clacton, held a private meeting with Alston on Sunday. His message was that places like Jaywick were \u201con the up\u201d and that recent investment in roads, housing and drains had \u201cchanged the place dramatically\u201d. Asked by the Guardian whether he thought austerity was over, he replied: \u201cThere\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel. But you can\u2019t just turn it off like a switch.\u201d Fountain is not so sure that things will get better. \u201cThe government has not been interested in the community. They have been obsessed by the Brexit agenda and they have taken their eyes off what\u2019s happening to ordinary people.\u201d",

Will we be made homeless, because of my birth defects?\u201d she told the meeting.</p> <p>\u201cWe have paid our taxes, we are hard workers, we are active in the community ... and we face the real prospect of being made homeless.\u201d</p> <p>Steve, a former jobcentre worker, told how he was driven to the brink by the stress of living on the breadline and being unable to provide for his family. He ran up debt and they became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/05/food-bank-use-will-soar-after-universal-credit-rollout-warns-charity\">reliant on handouts and food banks</a>. At one point he felt so despairing he considered stepping in front of a speeding car. \u201cI thought, if I were to die no-one would miss me.\u201d</p> <p>Rob, a nurse from Clacton, had been struck by chronic illness and was on long-term sickness benefit. He spoke of the \u201cfailing\u201d disability system. He had been found \u201cfit for work\u201d by an official benefits assessor, despite presenting evidence from his GP and hospital consultant that he was unable to. Subsequently he was told he had to re-apply for his disability benefits. The claim took seven weeks to be processed, leaving him without any income. He had to rely on friends for handouts, and made trips to the food bank. \u201cIt makes you feel worthless. The whole thing is a disgrace.\u201d</p> <p>Alston told the meeting the testimonies reflected those he had heard throughout his two-week tour. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/08/life-on-the-poverty-frontline-un-turns-its-gaze-on-uk\">Last week he visited Newcastle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/09/its-unfair-un-envoy-meets-children-living-in-poverty-in-scotland\">Edinburgh, Glasgow</a>, Cardiff, Belfast and Bristol. His tour continues on Monday in London. On Friday he will issue his interim report on how far the UK government is meeting its international human rights commitments on the right to housing, food and a decent standard of living. Earlier, Alston had met the Rev Sean Fountain, minister at Pier Avenue Baptist church in Clacton, a few miles up the coast from Jaywick. \u201cPeople are in crisis,\u201d Fountain said, \u201cand there is very little in the way of support.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/02/trump-is-a-cheeky-sod-essex-villagers-react-to-us-campaign-ad\">'Trump is a cheeky sod': Essex villagers react to US campaign ad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Faith and community groups were picking up the pieces as local government, schools, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/10/tory-police-cuts-wave-of-london-knife-crime-ex-chief-metropolitan-police-lord-blair\">policing budgets shrank</a>, he said. Volunteers from his church ran a drop-in centre, a small homeless project, and helped run a food bank. But in the face of rising poverty, homelessness and youth crime, it sometimes felt like an unequal battle. He said they got no financial help from the council \u201cand there are only so many volunteers to go round\u201d.</p> <p>Giles Watling, the Conservative MP for Clacton, held a private meeting with Alston on Sunday. His message was that places like Jaywick were \u201con the up\u201d and that recent investment in roads, housing and drains had \u201cchanged the place dramatically\u201d. Asked by the Guardian whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/29/is-austerity-really-over\">he thought austerity was over</a>, he replied: \u201cThere\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel. But you can\u2019t just turn it off like a switch.\u201d</p> <p>Fountain is not so sure that things will get better. \u201cThe government has not been interested in the community. They have been obsessed by the Brexit agenda and they have taken their eyes off what\u2019s happening to ordinary people.\u201d</p>",

Helen and Simon Pattinson began Montezuma\u2019s with a single store in Brighton in 2000. Following a sticky start \u2013 their main supplier went bust shortly after they signed their first lease \u2013 they have grown to employ 130 staff. They now operate five stores in London and the south-east, as well as a subscription chocolate club sending products through the post each month. Inverleith LLP, the Edinburgh-based private equity company, has now acquired a majority interest in Montezuma\u2019s, whose premium flavours include chilli and lime and organic dark chocolate orange and geranium. Helen Pattinson compared creating the business to raising a baby. \u201cGetting to 18 years and doing this deal is a bit like letting go, and seeing where it leads,\u201d she said. The Pattinsons were inspired to break into the chocolate business after a visit to South America in 1999, where they saw many small chocolate outlets. Having already given up their jobs as City lawyers, they decided to set up their own chocolate shop in the UK. They swiftly became manufacturers, too, when their key supplier went under before their launch. Helen said this was the making of the business, allowing them to test \u201cwacky flavours\u201d in their store and see what was popular. The deal with Inverleith will allow Montezuma\u2019s to open more stores, expand its range and sell its chocolate bars, buttons and truffles via more retailers. \u201cIt means we can take a few more risks. As you get bigger, you become more risk-averse as you don\u2019t want to lose it all,\u201d she added. Despite these new responsibilities, chocolate is still rather more fun than the law: \u201cWe\u2019ve grown beyond recognition, but we still have a laugh every day.\u201d Montezuma\u2019s was committed to keeping its chocolate manufacturing in the UK factory in Chichester, she said. Pattinson said she and her husband were \u201cvery proud of the British factory we\u2019ve built up in the last 18 years\u201d. They try to promote from within where possible; the female senior manager in charge of the factory operations started as a temporary packing worker 11 years ago. However, Brexit is making it harder to recruit new employees at Montezuma\u2019s, which has partly relied on European staff to grow the business. \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that we\u2019ve struggled to find staff in the last 18 months [following the triggering of Article 50 in March 2017],\u201d Helen said. She added that it was \u201claughable\u201d to suggest that Brexit would create more opportunities for UK workers. The value of Inverleith\u2019s investment has not been disclosed, but the Pattinsons are understood to be receiving several million pounds for the chunk they are selling.",

The only problem is the campaign, which breaks on social media and during ITV\u2019s Coronation Street on Monday, bears an uncanny resemblance to an ad recently put out by the perennial Christmas campaign winner John Lewis. The Sainsbury\u2019s ad, by Michael Gracey who directed the $400m-plus grossing Hugh Jackman musical, features a festive school play which seems to get off to a shaky start but goes on to be a winner with the cast performing a rendition of the New Radicals\u2019 1990s classic You Get What You Give. Sainsbury\u2019s denies it is worried about similarities between its ad and a joint John Lewis and Waitrose one that ran in September. It features a school play where the cast also stun the audience by knocking out a great version of a well-known classic, in this case Queen\u2019s Bohemian Rhapsody. Laura Boothby, the head of broadcast marketing at Sainsbury\u2019s, played down any concerns that similarities with John Lewis\u2019 campaign, which launches its much-anticipated festive ad this week, could take the sparkle out of its Christmas ambitions. \u201cWe are not too worried at all,\u201d she said, pointing out the ad was not a deliberate copycat. \u201cEvery single school up and down the country is doing a play or nativity play [at this time of year].\u201d Boothby said Sainsbury\u2019s began work on its Christmas ad in January and had not been tempted to go back to the drawing board. \u201cWhen John Lewis launched they set a standard,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t worried. It is right for Sainsbury\u2019s, it was still the right thing for us.\u201d The John Lewis campaign, the first joint campaign with Waitrose to promote the two retailers\u2019 rebranding as John Lewis &amp; Partners and Waitrose &amp; Partners, uses the strapline: \u201cWhen you\u2019re part of it, you put your heart into it.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s Christmas campaign has opted for: \u201cWe give all we\u2019ve got for the ones we love.\u201d \u201cThe school show is a flagship Christmas moment for many,\u201d said Boothby. \u201cThe evenings spent frantically learning lines, the inventive costumes, the whole family truly plays a part. This made it the perfect setting to bring our Christmas message to life.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s, which spent an estimated \u00a37m on advertising last December, has made the ad campaign the centrepiece of a wider marketing push that includes product-led ads on TV, radio, in newspapers, digital and outdoor advertising such as billboards, posters and buses.",
