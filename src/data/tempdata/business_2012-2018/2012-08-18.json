      "bodyText": "As it did for Team GB, this summer should have triggered a gold rush for JJB Sports. But instead executives at its Wigan headquarters are wondering if the chain's 40-year career on the high street is finally over. Last week, hopes for the struggling retailer faded further after US giant Dick's Sporting Goods, which had looked as though it might ride to the rescue, distanced itself from JJB, writing down the value of its \u00a320m investment in the company \u2013 made just four months ago \u2013 to zero. When that cash injection was announced in April, the agreement included the possibility of more funds. But in updating Dick's shareholders last week, chief executive Edward Stack was clear: \"We have no further funding obligation to JJB at this time and will continue to monitor the situation.\" This apparent change of heart had a dramatic effect on JJB's already battered share price: it closed the week down 30% at just 3.15p, valuing the company at around \u00a313m. When it last updated shareholders in July, JJB's then chief executive, Keith Jones, blamed poor sales of England shirts during the Euro 2012 tournament for a dire performance that meant it would have to put the brakes on much-needed store refurbishments and ask shareholders for more cash soon. But JJB has got the begging bowl out four times in as many years, and the cash-hungry business has burned through more than \u00a3200m raised from investors while a succession of management teams has showed little sign of effecting a turnaround. While JJB has been self-destructing, rivals have got stronger. \"Sports Direct stands for value; JD stands for fashion; and JJB stands for nothing,\" says one supplier. \"The people who have been managing JJB haven't come from a sportswear background and don't empathise or understand the customer. Now JJB's not the cheapest and it's not cool\u2026 it's not very good at anything.\" JJB has only survived a series of financial crunches thanks to the largesse of a small group of investors and its landlords, who have endured two company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) \u2013 legal agreements that enable struggling retailers to slash their rent costs. The fundraisings, including the one in April, garnered support from some of JJB's biggest shareholders: Invesco, Harris Associates, Crystal Amber and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The question is now, with still no sign of light at the end of the tunnel, whether they will throw more good money after bad. Insiders at JJB say talk of demise is premature, and that although recent trading has been poor, it has not breached its banking covenants: in July, JJB's bank debt stood at \u00a317.7m. But it has emerged that turnaround groups, such as Better Capital led by private equity tycoon Jon Moulton, are considering buying up its loans as a means of gaining control. \"As third parties put their hat into the ring to try and buy the group's debt, the story on JJB has gone from one of hope, given the backing of Dick's, to one of huge uncertainty again,\" says Singer analyst Matthew McEachran. If JJB were to fail, the list of buyers would perhaps be limited by competition concerns in what is still a close-knit sector. Those with long memories will remember the Office of Fair Trading's inquiry into the price-fixing of replica football shirts a decade ago, which landed many of the key players, including JJB, then the biggest name in the market, with multimillion-pound fines. Today JJB, with annual sales of \u00a3284.2m, is dwarfed by Sports Direct's turnover of \u00a31.8bn while number two player JD, another possible buyer, is grappling with a new charge \u2013 outdoor chain Blacks, which it took out of administration in January. The estimated \u00a38.5bn sports goods market appears to offer diminishing returns. In the 1990s and early part of this century, sportswear was a thriving sector thanks to its mass adoption as casualwear. But Sports Direct has annihilated the competition with its \"pile it high, sell it cheap\" approach, leaving niche stores and websites such as American Golf Discount Centre, Decathlon and Wiggle to carve up what's left. JJB has been riven by both internal and external battles. It has been unable to recover from the disastrous tenure of Chris Ronnie, chief executive between 2007 and 2009, who made a series of poor acquisitions that saddled it with debt. In April, Ronnie was charged with a series of offences relating to an alleged \u00a31m fraud at the retailer. Ronnie denies the charges. Analysts suggest the next test for JJB will be 29 September, when a big rent bill falls due. Dave Whelan, its founder, is keeping a watchful eye on his former charge. In 2009, he acquired its health club chain in a generous \u00a383m deal that bought JJB some time. \"I don't want it to go [into administration] and it would be sad for Wigan if it did go,\" he says. Although a fraction of its former size, the 180-store chain still employs more than 4,000 people. If JJB were to collapse, Whelan would be interested in buying \"certain aspects\" of it: \"I wouldn't be looking at the whole of JJB. There's quite a lot of things wrong and it's been badly run.\" But there is no reason why a sports shop \"run well\" shouldn't succeed, he says: sales in the gym shops, now called DW Sports Fitness, are up 15% \"purely on the back of the Olympics\". Following a recent visit to JJB's Wigan head office, the supplier left with a sense that it was all over: \"There seemed to be no fight, no leadership, no strategy.\" JJB has its own Olympic mascot in the shape of gold-medal-winning rower Sir Matthew Pinsent, who sits on its board. But there is little sign of Pinsent's sporting glory rubbing off on JJB.",

      "bodyText": "Despite the Olympic euphoria, there is growing pessimism about the short-term prospects of the British economy. The new orthodoxy is that Britain is too sickly to be cured by a short-term fix; policy should concentrate on bringing about sustainable long-term growth. This rules out an immediate boost to public spending and swings the debate to the more familiar territory of the causes of Britain's relative economic decline, with the right pressing for freer markets and a reduction in the size of the state, and the left rediscovering the virtues of industrial policy. But there is no need to place the short run and the long run in such dramatic opposition. Britain faces both a short-run problem of deficient demand and a long-term problem of unbalanced supply. Government needs to develop policies to deal with both simultaneously. The British economy is still reeling from the economic collapse of 2008. It is 2%, or \u00a327bn, smaller than it was four years ago and 12%, or \u00a3165bn, smaller than it would have been had growth continued at its postwar trend of 2.5% a year (today's prices). These are big numbers. People take comfort from the fact that the percentage of unemployment has risen less than the percentage of output has fallen. But this is because productivity has dropped: as the Guardian put it last week, \"it now requires many more of us to labour away to churn out the reduced volume of stuff\". That still leaves about 2.2 million extra idle and partly idle workers, many of them young, who could produce more \"stuff\" if the market for it was there. This market for output should be supplied by government initiative in two ways. First, the government should rescind its cuts in capital spending. According to the Treasury, departmental capital budgets are set to fall from \u00a350bn to \u00a340bn a year in cash terms from 2010-11 to 2014-15 \u2013 that is, by \u00a350bn altogether, with the heaviest cuts to school building, universities and social housing. \"Shovel-ready\" schemes, abandoned by the coalition, should be reactivated. The advantage of this is that it combines short-run demand expansion with long-run improvements in infrastructure. Secondly, the government should issue all households with time-limited spending vouchers, in sufficient annual amounts to provide a net stimulus to consumer spending. Ideally, these vouchers should be spent only on UK-produced goods. This could be encouraged by a \"Buy British\" campaign. Their spending would be far more effective in reviving the animal spirits of entrepreneurs than quantitative easing practised by the Bank of England. The two short-run programmes combined could add about \u00a3100bn to GDP over five years \u2013 almost enough to completely offset the contractionary effect of George Osborne's cuts to public spending. So much for the short run. By contrast, long-term policy should be addressed to correct the consequences of the failed Thatcherite gamble on financial services and the housing market. Without a strong manufacturing base there can be no export-led recovery, however low the pound sinks in international currency markets. The old smokestack industries are gone, but new industries can be developed. How? Nothing is more upsetting to the conventional wisdom than the thought of government \"picking winners\". Yet governments have been picking winners all over the world, notably in east Asia. What industrial policy does need, though, is clear focus and sustained commitment \u2013 such as was shown in plotting the success of Team GB. Previous attempts at industrial policy in this country have failed because of endless chops and changes. To spearhead a new-style industrial policy, the government should set up a national investment bank with capital of \u00a310bn, the right to borrow immediately, and a mandate to secure Britain a significant presence in cutting-edge technologies like mechatronics, optics, new materials and nanotechnology, and to invest in such green energy sources as wind power, solar power, hydropower and biomass. These may be too risky for private investors looking for quick returns, but may well attract institutional investors such as sovereign wealth and pension funds, and insurers looking for long-term income streams. As a further element in the rebalancing of supply we need to reduce the speculative role of finance, restoring it to its proper role as the conduit of savings to investment. Two measures would help: a government-sponsored revival of local banking, on the model of the old Scottish country banks and borrowing from the current example of the German Landesbanken; and a transactions tax on financial operations to cut down on what Adair Turner has called \"social waste\". These are the twin pillars of a policy that could bring about the short-term recovery of the UK economy and set it on the path to a prosperous future.
