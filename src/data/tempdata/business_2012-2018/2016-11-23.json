      "bodyText": "There has been a lot of talk of late \u2013 especially fired up due to the US presidential election \u2013 over the loss of manufacturing jobs. It is not a new phenomenon, after all Bruce Springsteen was singing in 1984 that \u201cthese jobs are going boys and they ain\u2019t coming back\u201d. And while the blame is easily laid at the feet of trade, figures from the USA show that the bigger reason is automation \u2013 and it will not be limited to manufacturing. One of the problems with Trump\u2019s narrative that free-trade agreements have been the major cause of job losses and the gutting of the manufacturing industry is that the USA manufacturing industry is actually doing quite well. The problem is not the manufacturing industry is shrinking, but that the output is more and more driven by technological improvements, not increases in labour. An article published last week by Mark Munro in the MIT Technology Review noted that since the 1980s USA manufacturing output has increased, but employment has declined: And more importantly since the recovery from the GFC, USA manufacturing output has surged, but employment has not. The reason isn\u2019t trade, but, as Munro notes, the \u201chighly automated nature of the sector\u2019s recent revitalisation\u201d. It\u2019s not surprising manufacturing workers, both current and former, believed Trump\u2019s spin \u2013 after all a drowning man will clutch at a straw. And it\u2019s not surprising that we have heard similar rhetoric here in Australia, because the story here from the 1980s through to the GFC is remarkably the same as in the USA \u2013 increasing output, and flat/declining employment. During the 1990s Australia\u2019s manufacturing output rose in sync with that of the USA (though not by as much) and our employment remained similarly flat. The difference was employment in the USA manufacturing industry began to fall in the early 2000s after it suffered a recession, whereas Australia entered a boom period: Just prior to the GFC in June 2008, Australian manufacturing output was 50% higher in real terms than it was in 1987, but employment was 1.5% lower. But the problem is since the GFC, both employment and output have fallen \u2013 a point that is made clear when looking at output and employment since 1987 relative to where it was in June 2008: In the USA, manufacturing output is now back where it was prior to the GFC, whereas here in Australia manufacturing output is now lower in real terms than any time this century. In the eight years prior to the GFC, Australian manufacturing output grew by 15% - just below the 17% growth achieved by the USA manufacturing sector in that time. But while the output growth was much the same, our employment held up much better \u2013 it fell just 2% compared to a 20% fall in the USA: But in the eight years since the GFC, while the USA\u2019s manufacturing output has recovered, employment remains poor \u2013 10% lower than it was before the GFC. In Australia, output is down 14.5%, and employment in the industry is down 16.5%. Thinking that an increase in manufacturing output will solve things is however shown to be a mirage. Since the bottom of the GFC in June 2009, USA manufacturing output has surged 32%, but there has been a mere 2% increase in employment. This is bad news for manufacturing workers in the USA, but especially here in Australia. The problem for Australia is that we are much more affected by loss of output though trade as well as the shift towards robotics. The USA remains easily the largest economy in the world. Even with the ability to import manufactured goods from other nations with cheaper labour, the market for American-made goods remains massive given the size of USA domestic market. But at 6.5% the size of the USA\u2019s GDP, Australia\u2019s economy is to the USA like South Australia is to the rest of Australia. As a result we don\u2019t really have a large enough domestic market to sustain our manufacturing industry \u2013 imagine how well a manufacturing industry would go if it had to rely only on selling things within South Australia\u2019s borders. It means our manufacturing industry is not only subject to shifts towards more productive output (that is, less labour, more robots) as is the USA, but more subject to losing manufacturing to other nations due to trade. It\u2019s no real shock that since the Australia-USA free trade agreement came into effect in January 2005 exports to the USA have increased by 30%, but imports from the USA have increased by 40%: It\u2019s one of the reasons why the productivity commission has not been all that praising of free-trade agreements. For Australia the benefits of free trade mostly come via cheaper imports than from an increase in exports. The decline in manufacturing output since the GFC doesn\u2019t mean we should be against trade \u2013 but you can\u2019t expect to have the benefits of paying the same for a car as you did 25 year ago and also expect to have a thriving local car industry. And we also we need to face up to the fact that the 30 year receding tide of the manufacturing sector won\u2019t be turned if only we had more trade barriers. As we can see from the USA\u2019s figures \u2013 and indeed from our own over the past 30 years \u2013 even if our manufacturing output does improve, it won\u2019t lead to an increase in manufacturing jobs. And if you think that is bad enough, just remember that the automation takeover that has happened to manufacturing over the past 30 years is now happening in other industries.",

Remember, too, that the \u00a323bn will be spent over five years, so an average of \u00a34.6bn a year. And note that the spending is weighted towards the later years; in the first year, 2017-18, the figure is just \u00a32.4bn. Of that sum, affordable housing will claim almost half and the outlay should properly be seen as a necessary response to government figures that showed the number of affordable homes built in England last year fell to the lowest level for 24 years. Hammond, in his speech, said he had deliberately avoided turning his statement into a long list of individual projects being supported. But was that to avoid boring his audience or because government is still uncertain about what it wants to build? Some of the known elements \u2013 the \u00a31bn to explore 5G broadband and the upgrade to rail and road links between Oxford and Cambridge \u2013 already feel over-familiar. Does the government even know how it plans to spend all its \u00a323bn? Decisions on almost a third \u2013 the \u00a37bn earmarked for 2021/22 \u2013 will only be made \u201cin due course,\u201d according to the Treasury document. \u201cThe missing component in the autumn statement was a new pipeline of transparent, viable projects for much heralded high-value investment,\u201d said John Hicks, director of AECOM, an infrastructure services firm that has worked on 2012 Olympics and Crossrail. Andrew Jameson of MUFG, which invests in infrastructure around the world, made a similar point: \u201cIt is disappointing that the statement did not indicate any real signs of a properly-defined pipeline of core infrastructure projects, likes schools and hospitals, which has been lacking in recent years and is much needed in the UK.\u201d In Hammond\u2019s defence, one could argue that the government has a plan to get there eventually. He said between 1% and 1.2% of GDP will be invested every year from 2020 in economic infrastructure, which is defined as transport, energy, flood defences, water, waste and digital communications, areas covered by the new-ish national infrastructure commission. A ratio of 1%-1.2% compares to 0.8% of GDP being spent currently, so Hammond\u2019s commitment is meaningful. But four years is a long time to wait for a bigger set of projects that businesses like to term \u201cshovel ready\u201d. And the shame is that so much could have been done, and earlier, if successive governments had not been bewitched by big-budget HS2. Those dull but easy-to-do road and rail upgrades will do more to meet Hammond\u2019s productivity ambitions than the new high-speed railway. Estate agents shouldn\u2019t cry foul Estate agents\u2019 share prices tell the story: they will be hurt by the ban on letting agents\u2019 fees charged to tenants. London-based estate agent Foxtons fell 14%; Countrywide, the UK\u2019s largest agency, was 5% lower. Their trade bodies queued up to warn that the fees will just rebound on tenants via higher rents. Maybe they will, in part, but the process should not be mechanical. Estate agents will first have to persuade landlords to pick up fees previously charged to tenants. Some landlords, one suspects, will make the reasonable point that the agents have only themselves to blame for milking the market. Many of those landlords have their own complaints about agents\u2019 price-gouging tactics. The chancellor\u2019s ban is welcome. It does not guarantee to improve the lot of tenants. But it will make fees more transparent, which is definitely an improvement. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 November 2016. An earlier version misnamed Andrew Jameson as Andrew Johnson.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Weaker business spending and a squeeze on consumers from higher inflation will dent the UK economy next year, but warnings for a post-referendum recession should prove unfounded, according to the government\u2019s independent forecasters. The Office for Budget Responsibility was forced to revise down its prediction made before the Brexit vote that GDP would rise 2.2% next year. It now sees the economy expanding by only 1.4% and warns there will be a knock-on effect on the public finances. That forecast was a touch more positive than the picture painted by other forecasters such as the International Monetary Fund, and the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, was quick to point out in his autumn statement that it would leave Britain outperforming France and Italy next year and possibly Germany too. The OBR said the main factors behind its gloomier outlook for growth next year and in 2018 stemmed from Brexit vote effects, including the pound\u2019s sharp drop since the referendum, which has raised the cost of imports to the UK. Presenting the fiscal watchdog\u2019s first set of forecasts since March\u2019s budget, OBR chairman Robert Chote highlighted that they were subject to a large degree of uncertainty as the UK prepares to embark on Brexit negotiations. In order to factor in the impact of that process and of the UK eventually leaving the EU, the OBR had made some \u201cbroad brush judgments\u201d, he said. Those included an assumption that the UK would leave the bloc in April 2019 and that the Brexit process would hit net migration and trade. \u201cWe expect the quarterly growth rate of GDP to continue slowing into next year, as uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future trade and migration regime delays business investment and as the fall in the pound squeezes real consumer spending by pushing up inflation,\u201d said Chote. \u201cBut growth remains positive \u2013 we have not assumed more aggressive job shedding or a jump in precautionary saving, both of which pose downside risks if the road to Brexit is bumpy.\u201d The growth forecast for 2018 was cut to 1.7% from 2.1% back in March, but growth is expected to recover to 2.1% in 2019 and 2020, the same as previous forecasts. Chote noted that the OBR\u2019s outlook was more optimistic than the average of other forecasters. The Bank of England, for example, also predicts growth will slow to 1.4% next year but then sees barely any improvement in 2018, with GDP expanding just 1.5%. The IMF forecasts UK growth of 1.1% next year. The tone reflects signs of resilience in the early economic indicators since the Brexit vote. Consumer spending has continued to grow apace, economic growth was stronger than expected and unemployment has dropped to an 11-year low. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said the OBR\u2019s outlook reflected that picture. \u201cThe OBR sees Brexit taking a smaller chunk out of UK growth than many feared in the wake of the referendum. The fact that the OBR\u2019s growth forecast for 2017, at 1.4%, is above current market estimates and twice as high as the market expected in July, testifies to the resilience of the UK economy,\u201d he said. But the group Economists for Brexit was critical of the OBR\u2019s outlook as too downbeat. \u201cWhilst it acknowledges the fact that the decision of the government\u2019s chosen path is uncertain, it then applies what amounts to an arbitrary Brexit penalty on the UK economy without any proper justification,\u201d said Patrick Minford, the group\u2019s co-chair. \u201cWhy does it assume lower productivity, a spending slowdown due to uncertainty and lower immigration?\u201d The OBR said in its assumptions around Brexit that productivity growth \u2013 already an area where the UK underperforms other big economies \u2013 would be hurt by weaker investment. It also flagged that the outlook for productivity growth remained the biggest and most important uncertainty around its projections for the government coffers. \u201cFor all the attention it will receive now, Brexit has not supplanted this uncertainty. It has simply added to it,\u201d said Chote. On trade, the OBR predicts the weak pound will boost net trade over the next two years, with UK exports more competitive in overseas markets and imports to the UK less attractive relative to domestically produced goods and services. But longer-term it warns exiting the EU will reduce growth in exports and imports. The OBR also sees the UK adopting tighter immigration controls and becoming less attractive as a destination for immigrants, with knock-on effects for economic growth and the public finances. \u201cOur net inward migration assumption is unchanged since March, but we would have increased it by about 80,000 a year in the absence of the referendum,\u201d said Chote. Such an increase in net migration \u201cwould have boosted tax revenue by more than it would have raised spending\u201d, he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u201cThe first challenge is to increase our productivity. Britain today is some 20% less productive than our main competitors and has been for years.\u201d Not the words of Philip Hammond in his autumn statement but those of Gordon Brown in his pre-Budget report 19 years ago. \u201cThe productivity gap is well known, but shocking nonetheless,\u201d Hammond said on Wednesday. \u201cIt takes a German worker four days to produce what we make in five, which means, in turn, that too many British workers work longer hours for lower pay than their counterparts.\u201d His comments, and their symmetry with Brown\u2019s despite two decades between them, show the problem of productivity is an enduring one. Productivity is the rate of output per unit of input, or in other words the value of products made or sold by a worker in an hour of work. As Brown\u2019s comment shows, lacklustre productivity has hung over the UK for years. It has become more pronounced since the financial crisis, however, with an expansion of the workforce and a fall in unemployment not met with a proportionate growth in GDP. The government\u2019s autumn statement document states that improving productivity is the \u201ccentral long-term economic challenge\u201d for the UK and pivotal to increasing wages and living standards. Hammond has identified better infrastructure, technology and skills as the foundations for doing so, which is why he unveiled a new \u00a323bn national productivity investment fund in his autumn statement. Economists, however, said the government needed to do more than fund new infrastructure projects. Yael Selfin, the head of macroeconomics at KPMG, said: \u201cIt is a pity that there was not more focus on education. \u201cIf the government intends to make the UK less reliant on non-UK workers post-Brexit, the readiness of the local labour force will need to improve.\u201d Poor management costs the UK economy \u00a384bn a year, said Ann Francke , the chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute. \u201cOur businesses are operating in a period of great uncertainty. This makes it difficult to plan ahead and affects how we resource and develop our employees,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to attract and retain skilled managers, and we need 2 million more by 2024. So we know that building management capability is critical for growth in the UK and we hope that the welcome focus on productivity will include the need to improve our management structures.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Business leaders have told the government it must convert a new \u00a323bn productivity investment fund into \u201ctarmac, tracks and telecoms\u201d rapidly if it wants to boost Britain\u2019s lagging productivity and economic growth. The private sector has become increasingly frustrated at a string of unfulfilled pledges by the government \u2013 primarily by the former chancellor George Osborne \u2013 to step up investment in British infrastructure. Philip Hammond, Osborne\u2019s successor, announced in the autumn statement a national productivity investment fund that will be launched in an attempt to boost productivity by investing in innovation and infrastructure. The fund, to be financed by extra borrowing, will oversee \u00a323bn of spending over the next five years. Some of the expenditure has already been allocated to specific areas: \u00a37.2bn on building new homes; \u00a34.7bn on science and innovation; \u00a32.6bn on modernising roads, building infrastructure for electric vehicles and supporting railways; and \u00a3700m on high-speed fibre broadband and 5G services. The announcement was broadly welcomed as a way to kickstart much-needed improvements in infrastructure across the country. However, there are major concerns about how the fund will be run, which projects will be backed, and how other proposals in the autumn statement \u2013 such as the restrictions on salary sacrifice schemes \u2013 could damage productivity. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of business lobby group the CBI, said Hammond had \u201cprioritised a pragmatic downpayment on future productivity growth\u201d, but added: \u201cThese measures must now be translated into action. That means tarmac, tracks and telecoms being laid, and clear, deliverable timetables for major projects. Only then will they act as a catalyst for investment, jobs and growth.\u201d The autumn statement document says the specific projects to be funded will be decided in \u201cdue course, using value for money assessments, following HM Treasury standards\u201d. It adds: \u201cWhere relevant, expert sector bodies such as Highways England, the Homes and Communities Agency and UK Research and Innovation will make this assessment.\u201d The national infrastructure commission has also been set up to advise the government on long-term investments and make recommendations. However, \u00a37bn of the \u00a323bn fund remains unallocated to any sector and is not scheduled to be spent until 2021-2022. The government said the fund would take total spending on housing, economic infrastructure and research and development to \u00a3170bn over the next five years. But the size of the fund is dwarfed by the government\u2019s commitment to the HS2 rail line, which will cost an estimated \u00a356bn. Christopher Mahon, investment manager at asset management firm Barings, said the chancellor\u2019s infrastructure plan is \u201cupside-down\u201d with \u201ceye-watering sums\u201d committed to HS2, a third runway at Heathrow airport and Hinkley Point C. The final two projects will be built using private sector funds, although they are supported by government subsidies. \u201cMeanwhile only token amounts of money are being spent on practical projects that are needed today, such as easing rail and road bottlenecks,\u201d Mahon said. \u201cFor example, the \u00a32bn announced today [for transport] is 50 times smaller than the amounts committed to the three mega projects alone. This is despite the Treasury\u2019s own analysis showing these smaller, less glamorous projects give the bigger payback to the taxpayer. So it is a great shame that the chancellor continues to be seduced by the glamour of the mega and ignores the utility and timeliness of the micro. \u201cBritain seems to be locked into a type of topsy turvy spending dogma which results in the UK\u2019s well-known productivity stagnation.\u201d Critics also claimed the government\u2019s ambition of boosting productivity could be undermined by other measures in the autumn statement. For example, JLT, the insurer, said restrictions on salary sacrifice schemes and an increase in the insurance premium tax would hit employees and hurt companies that try to reward strong performances. Mark Pemberthy, director of JLT employee benefits, said: \u201cIt is ironic that in an autumn statement which is targeting productivity, some of the incentives that employers use to raise productivity and engage their workforce have been made less affordable.\u201d Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said the government could have done more to encourage businesses to invest, which would also boost productivity. He said: \u201cThe chancellor\u2019s attempts to increase productivity by investing in transport infrastructure, broadband and housing are welcome, but businesses would also have liked to have seen measures to encourage them to invest now. \u201cThe OBR predicts that next year will be the low point for growth, so we are surprised that amidst all of the political and economic uncertainty there weren\u2019t many measures to help \u2018just managing\u2019 businesses now.\u201d Paul Dossett, partner at accountancy firm Grant Thornton, added: \u201cInfrastructure is important but building roads and bridges will not solve the productivity problem alone. \u201cInstead, we need to start at school, build aspirations and community involvement, and focus on measures that will improve not only economic prosperity but increase the health, happiness and wellbeing of the population.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "All eyes are on the Opec meeting next week, to see if oil producers can agree an output cut. But the weekly Baker Hughes rig count from the US still excites some interest. In the latest figures, a couple of days early due to Thanksgiving, the report showed 5 gas and oil rigs were added last week to 593. This marks the biggest monthly rise since July. The news has seen Brent crude, which was slightly up ahead of the figures, slip back around 0.18% to $49.03 a barrel. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting yet another record, European markets were in a more lacklustre mood. Bond yields jumped after Reuters reported that the European Central Bank was considering lending out more of the bonds it had bought, in an effort to boost liquidity. In the UK the Autumn Statement was the big economic event. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The autumn statement will command the headlines, but the broad market impact has been limited. Aside from the hit to estate agents this morning, housebuilders were boosted by Mr Hammond\u2019s plan to build more homes, but the impact was limited. Indeed, while the pound did gain against the US dollar in the period of the statement itself, the gains were rapidly wiped out by a surge in US durable goods orders. The resultant push higher in the dollar sent other currencies lower, indicating that the rally in the greenback is not done yet. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 2.01 points or 0.03% at 6817.71 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.48% to 10,662.44 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.42% at 4529.21 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.07% at 16,532.26 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.28% at 8627.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.21% to 632.52 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 0.15% at 19051, having earlier hit another new record of 19067. Over in Greece prime minister Alexis Tsipras has announced the country is very close to concluding bailout negotiations with creditors. But in a new twist to the debt-stricken nation\u2019s bid to regain economic certainty, core eurozone member states also said that they would cancel talks expected to focus on Greece this Friday. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The Greek prime minister was in upbeat mood as he predicted that negotiations with creditors would be completed by December 5 a move, he said, that would automatically open the way to crucial debt relief discussions. Addressing MPs in his leftwing Syriza party, Alexis Tsipras insisted that while his two-party government was implementing its bailout commitments \u201cto the letter\u201d it would never yield to what he described as \u201cabsurd demands\u201d creditors were also making over labour reforms. \u201cWe re not going to discuss absurd demands whether they be new measures or, even worse, measures after the [EU] program ends [in 2018].\u201d Tsipras has seen his popularity ratings plummet as his coalition has forged ahead with unpopular tax hikes, budget and pension cuts, the price of rescue funds to keep the country afloat. Working on the assumption that conclusion of the review will trigger debt relief talks, Athens is keen to end the negotiations by the time eurozone finance ministers hold their last meeting of the year on December 5. But Germany\u2019s hardline finance minister Wolfgang Schauble has assiduously attempted to shoot down any such hope, telling German media earlier this week that it would be a disservice to Greece and its reform progress if its monumental debt mountain was cut. Despite the widely held view that the country\u2019s debt load is at the root of its economic ills, Schauble claimed that Greece would not face a debt repayment problem for the next ten years. The international Monetary Fund has been Athens\u2019 biggest ally in the debt writedown battle, saying it will not sign up to its third \u20ac86bn rescue package until the issue is resolved. Hopes of ending that row were brought to an abrupt halt today when the German finance ministry announced that talks aimed at securing the IMF\u2019s participation in the bailout program would not be going ahead. Finance ministers of core EU countries had been due to meet this Friday to discuss the possible concessions Brussels could offer to bring the Washington-based organization on board. The post-election rally which has taken US markets to new peaks has stuttered in early trading, as a fall in the healthcare sector has taken some of the shine off. Pharmaceutical companies had been in demand since Donald Trump\u2019s victory, on the basis that the new administration would not bring in Hillary Clinton\u2019s threatened price controls. But a trial failure for its Alzheimer\u2019s treatment sent shares in Eli Lilly sharply lower, dragging down other companies developing similar drugs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is current down 10 points or 0.06%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.25% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.38%. Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: After a couple of months in the doldrums, today\u2019s data shows durable goods orders are at their highest since February. This could keep dollar-buying popular and also increase the likelihood of an interest rate hike. Along with rising inflation and a strong dollar, today\u2019s better than expected numbers are another positive pointer and the Federal Reserve is looking more likely than ever to buckle under increasing pressure to raise rates on December 14th. The greenback will now be given a breather as markets shut up shop for tomorrow\u2019s Thanksgiving and Friday looks a light day. Away from the UK autumn statement, there are some strong US figures. Orders for durable goods - longer lasting products such as computers, toasters and machinery - rebounded in October after a decline in September. They rose 0.4%, in line with expectations, while the September figure was revised from a 1.3% drop to 1.4%. But the recovery suggests that the US economy is strengthening in the fourth quarter, and adds for fuel to the idea that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December. Meanwhile the number of Americans registering for unemployment benefits rose from a 43 year low last week, up 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 251,000. But this is still consistent with a tightening jobs market. A reminder, our politics live blog will be following Chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s first autumn statement: Over in Europe again, and Reuters is reporting that the European Central Bank wants to loan out some of the government debt it has bought to provide more liquidity in the bond market. Reuters says: The European Central Bank is looking for ways to lend out more of its huge pile of government debt to avert a freeze in the 5.5 trillion euro short-term funding market that underpins the financial system, central bank sources told Reuters. The ECB has bought more than a trillion euros ($1.06 trillion) of euro zone government bonds in a bid to shore up economic growth and inflation in the euro zone. For the most part the bank is holding these bonds. By doing so, it has taken away the key ingredient for repurchase agreements, or repos, whereby financial firms lend to each other against collateral, typically high-rated government bonds such as Germany\u2019s. Repo is used by investment funds to finance trading and is regarded by the ECB as a key avenue to transmit its own monetary stimulus to the economy. A freeze in repo activity risks undoing some of the ECB\u2019s stimulus by hampering lending between financial companies and leaving bond markets vulnerable to sharp selloffs. To avert this, the ECB wants to make it easier for banks to borrow the bonds that it has bought so that they can be used as collateral for repo loans, the sources said. The full story is here. Back with estate agents, and if the letting fees are banned, will this just mean rents go up? Patrick Collinson investigates: The pensions regulator is currently giving evidence to MPs on, among other things, BHS. Ahead of the meeting, the chairman of the House of Commons work and pensions committee Frank Field wrote to the regulator asking if Sir Philip Green\u2019s superyacht and other assets could be seized to help plug the gap in the BHS pension fund. My colleague Graham Ruddick is following the hearing: Back with the fall in estate agency shares, and analyst Anthony Codling at broker Jefferies International said: Our view is that it would not be logical to ban fees outright, for instance inventory checks are usually outsourced to third parties and used to safeguard both landlord and tenant, perhaps these fees should be split. Credit referencing fees: we think it fair that tenants can demonstrate that they have the ability to pay the rent. Where fees are possibly unfair are, for instance, blanket fees of \u00a3300 to set up a standard tenancy agreement or a \u00a360 additional charge to move in on a Saturday, such fees we believe generate high margins for the agent at the expense of the so called JAM tenants (Just About Managing). At the moment, Foxtons is down 9.5%, LSL Property is 6.4% lower, Purplebricks has fallen 6%, Countrywide has lost 4.9% and Savills has slipped 1%. On the corporate front, Thomas Cook has said it will pay a dividend for the first time in five years, and said it did not expect the fall in the pound following the Brexit vote to make foreign holidays more expensive. The news has helped push the travel group\u2019s shares up more than 8%. The full story is here: Meanwhile United Utilities has reported a 1.4% rise in first half profits to \u00a3313m, helped by lower infrastructure spending and new pricing regulations. Political and economic uncertainty around the Brexit vote was less of a drag on economic growth than expected, Bank of England policymaker Kristin Forbes has said in speech at a JP Morgan conference. Reuters reports: Forbes - who voted against restarting government bond purchases in August - said central banks should not use uncertainty as an excuse to avoid making decisions or for the BoE to change its approach to setting policy. But she said uncertainty was hard to measure, and may be currently having less of an effect on Britain\u2019s economy. \u201cThe strength of the UK economy during the period of heightened uncertainty before and after the referendum on EU membership suggests that uncertainty is dragging less on growth than has traditionally occurred,\u201d she said. One reason could be that some factors which typically fed into economists\u2019 measures of uncertainty - such as negative media reports and an unusually wide range of growth forecasts - played less of a role than thought. Another was that rises in uncertainty typically led to tighter credit conditions, with businesses and consumers finding it harder to borrow money. This had not happened in Britain after June\u2019s referendum. It is uncertain whether the positive eurozone manufacturing performance will continue, says Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade: Having continued to post weaker than expected figures throughout the first half of 2016, today\u2019s manufacturing numbers add to the brighter picture for the eurozone\u2019s economic conditions in the last six months. Eurozone manufacturing has remained surprisingly steady since June\u2019s Brexit vote, with many countries showing signs of growth. Whether this can be maintained when the UK finally triggers Article 50 and begins to execute its formal withdrawal is up for debate. Concerns in the region also linger with German expansion slowing down. Any further grumblings from the economic power house of Europe would spell tough times ahead for ECB president Mario Draghi. IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said: The preliminary PMI results for November indicate the sharpest monthly increase in business activity so far this year, with plenty of signs that growth will continue to accelerate. The PMI readings so far for the fourth quarter point to GDP expanding 0.4%, led by a rebound in German growth to 0.5%. France is also seen to be enjoying its best spell since the start of the year, with the PMIs signalling GDP growth of 0.2-0.3% in the fourth quarter. What\u2019s especially encouraging to see is the build- up of uncompleted orders, which showed the largest rise since May 2011. Increasing numbers of firms are boosting capacity as a result of the order book backlog, leading to the joint-largest increase in employment seen this side of the global financial crisis. ECB policymakers will also be pleased to see inflationary pressures are intensifying steadily. Average prices charged for good and services showed the biggest rise for over five years, albeit with the rate of increase being very modest. However, with indicators such as rising backlogs of work and longer supplier delivery times suggesting demand is exceeding supply, price pressures look set to intensify further in coming months. Overall business activity in the Eurozone was at its best level since December 2015, according to the latest figures. IHS Markit\u2019s preliminary composite purchasing managers index came in at 53.8, u from 52.9 in October. Again it was a strong performance from the service sector which gave a boost to the figures. The services PMI was 54.1 in November, up from 52.8 and better than the expected 53. Manufacturing edged up from 53.5 in October to 53.7, higher than the forecast 53.3. The latest hit to estate agency shares follows a poor performance since the Brexit vote, says Neil Wilson, market analyst at ETX Capital: News of a ban on charging fees to tenants comes as a hammer blow to embattled estate agents. Shares in estate agents opened sharply lower this morning as the government plans to ban upfront fees charged by letting agents... Passing on the cost to landlords could drive down fees by improving competition, although estate agents claim they make no money from fees. Estate agents have suffered since the Brexit vote \u2013 shares in Foxtons are still trading down around 30% from their pre-referendum level amid falling client activity. Countrywide stock is now worth a third of what it was in May 2015. As with the French preliminary PMIs for November, so for Germany, with manufacturing disappointing but services performing better than expected. The manufacturing PMI came in at 54.4, down from 55 in October and a two month low. But services rose from 54.2 in October to 55, a six month high. The Composite output index edged down from 55.1 in October to 54.9. IHS Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said: Although the PMI failed to further build on October\u2019s ten-month high, the latest survey results highlight that Germany\u2019s private sector economy remains in good shape in November. Moreover, the data suggest that economic growth has picked up from the meagre 0.2% rate in the third quarter. The survey data also signal that a healthy labour market remains one of the mainstays of Germany\u2019s economic upturn. With new order intakes rising sharply, the expansion in workforce numbers was insufficient to prevent a further build-up of unfinished business, however. That said, rising backlogs generally lead to higher future output and it is therefore likely that companies will remain busy in coming months. Moreover, there are clear signs that price pressures are intensifying further. Input cost inflation reached its highest level in over four-and-a- half years and output prices were raised further which should be welcome news for ECB policymakers who are desperately trying to boost inflation in the region. Despite Wall Street hitting yet new records - the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 19,000 for the first time - European markets seem reluctant to follow suit. The FTSE 100 is certainly taking its cue from the US, climbing 0.67%, with mining shares once more among the gainers. But Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped 0.075 and France\u2019s Cac is currently down 0.03%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. News that the UK government will ban fees charged by estate agents to cover the supposed administrative costs of families renting their homes has seen shares in the sector slump. Countrywide is down 6%, Foxtons has fallen 9% and Savills has slipped 1%. Purplebricks has lost more than 4%. Meanwhile on a busy day for economic news, we are due to get the latest snapshot of activity in the eurozone, with the first estimates of manufacturing and services for November. France is first out of the blocks, with a better than expected service sector figure helping make up for a dip in manufacturing data. The service sector index rose to a two month high of 52.6 in November from 51.4 the previous month, and better than the 51.9 expected. But the manufacturing index edged down to 51.5 in November, down from 51.8 in October and compared to a forecast of 51.4. In the US there are initial jobless claims, manufacturing PMIs and consumer confidence figures. We are also on the lookout for results from Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group, and there are also updates from Thomas Cook and United Utilities. Oh yes, and there is also the small matter of the rest of the Autumn Statement, which is being covered separately in our politics live blog:",

A combination of new and previously announced initiatives will account for the haul, as Hammond also promised to press ahead with new sanctions on advisers who facilitate tax avoidance. In his autumn statement to the Commons, Hammond said: \u201cThe government is committed to tackling tax evasion, avoidance and aggressive tax planning \u2026 but we must constantly be alert to new threats to our tax base, and be willing to move swiftly to counter them.\u201d He said he would close salary sacrifice schemes where employees are allowed to pay for perks such as gym memberships out of gross earnings, \u201cshut down inappropriate use of the VAT flat rate scheme\u201d and \u201cintroduce a new penalty for those who enable the use of a tax avoidance scheme that HMRC later challenges and defeats\u201d. The government also said it would \u201cclarify the application of the VAT zero-rating for adapted motor vehicles to stop the abuse of this legislation, while continuing to provide help for for disabled wheelchair users\u201d. \u201cThese measures, and others set out in the autumn statement document, raise around \u00a32bn over the forecast period,\u201d Hammond said. The measures received a mixed reception from the tax profession, especially those targeted at advisers on avoidance schemes. Frank Haskew, the head of the tax faculty at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), said: \u201cThe public is rightly concerned about tax avoidance, and we support efforts to tackle it. \u201cICAEW already has a professional code of conduct in relation to tax advice and we have been working with the government to ensure that our code continues to be fit for purpose and retains confidence. \u201cAlthough we do not have the details yet, the government needs to ensure any new rules are properly targeted only to tackle those advisers that promote aggressive tax schemes. \u201cIf the measures are too widely targeted, there is a danger that reputable professional advisers could still end up being caught in the crossfire when advising on legitimate tax planning, while the real targets escape any penalty.\u201d The chancellor also attacked so-called \u201cdisguised earnings\u201d \u2013 often known as perks \u2013 which are payments made to an employee so as to bypass the payment of PAYE and national insurance. Hammond said: \u201cAt the budget we committed to removing the tax benefits of disguised earnings for employees, and I am now going to do the same for the self-employed and employers, raising a further \u00a3630m over the forecast period.\u201d He also attacked salary sacrifice schemes, where costs such as the cost of gym memberships are taken out of gross earnings, thereby providing the employee with a tax saving. Sue Robinson, an employment tax partner at the accountancy firm EY, said: \u201cPeople who use such schemes for benefits such as health screening and mobile phones and tablets will be among those who see their tax bills rise. \u201cMany of those benefits in kind are often portrayed as \u2018perks\u2019 for the higher paid, but the expansion of the salary sacrifice model over recent years will mean that large numbers of basic rate taxpayers will be impacted, particularly in sectors such as the health service.\u201d",

The retailer\u2019s existing luxury handbag and accessories department at the Oxford Street store will triple in size by 2018 to 5,750 sq m (61,000 sq ft), will be longer than the football pitch at Wembley Stadium and will be big enough to stock more than 70,000 bags, luggage and scarves. Designed in collaboration with Turner Contemporary architect David Chipperfield, the vast white marble-floored space will open gradually in three main phases. Selfridges said the masterplan was created around the never-realised ambition of its US founder Harry Gordon Selfridge to create a unified block within the Oxford Street, Orchard Street, Wigmore Street and Duke Street quadrant. The eastern Duke Street facade will undergo a dramatic refurbishment which includes a new triple-height entrance directly into the accessories hall. At the heart of the hall is the Fount \u2013 a 14-seat circular bar. Brands ranging from Charlotte Olympia, Sophie Hulme and 3.1 Phillip Lim, through to luxury powerhouses including Herm\u00e8s, Chanel and C\u00e9line, feature in the new hall.

This singular identity is further underlined by the introduction of a series of screens that unite the brand concessions.\u201d Selfridges reported a drop in full-year profits last month following the company-wide investment programme. The retailer said operating profit fell by 1.9% to \u00a3152m in the 12 months to 31 January, compared with a year earlier, despite seeing a 5% jump in gross sales to a record \u00a31.4bn.",

    "webTitle": "Sir Philip Green's yacht and other assets could be seized, says regulator", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green\u2019s assets, including his \u00a3100m superyacht, could be seized by the courts if he refuses to comply with a legal demand to cover the \u00a3571m deficit in the BHS pension scheme, the chief executive of the Pensions Regulator (TPR) has said. Lesley Titcomb told the work and pensions select committee that a court would determine how to raise funds from the billionaire tycoon, including possible seizure of assets, if he does not pay up when a legal demand is issued, or reach a settlement with the regulator. Titcomb said: \u201cIf we are talking about a contribution notice, that creates a normal legally enforceable debt to the scheme and it would then be the scheme trustees or the PPF [the Pension Protection Fund] who, with our full support in any way, shape or form we could offer, would seek to recover that debt through the courts. The courts would determine how that would be achieved.\u201d It is highly unlikely that Green\u2019s yacht will be seized. However, one pensions expert said the \u201cprospect of the bailiffs on the gangplank\u201d might focus the retail tycoon\u2019s mind on sorting out the BHS pension deficit. A parliamentary investigation into the demise of the retailer found that BHS had been systematically plundered under its former owners Green and Dominic Chappell. Green controlled the business for 15 years until he sold it to Chappell, a three-time bankrupt, for \u00a31 in March 2015. Green, his family and other BHS shareholders collected at least \u00a3580m from the retailer, while Chappell\u2019s company Retail Acquisitions was paid an estimated \u00a317m. TPR has started legal proceedings against Green, Chappell and their companies in an attempt to plug the pension deficit. It has issued warning notices to the former owners outlining why they are liable to support the pension scheme. Green and Chappell now have the opportunity to respond to the warning notices before a determinations panel, an independent body within TPR, decides how much they must contribute to the BHS pension scheme. The determinations panel ruling is a legal demand, but could be appealed all the way to the supreme court by Green and Chappell. Titcomb said the panel was unlikely to meet until the middle of next year and the \u201cdoor remains open\u201d to any settlement offers from Green. TPR is understood be seeking at least \u00a3300m from Green and said it is yet to receive a \u201ccredible and comprehensive offer\u201d. The tycoon is understood to have offered a deal worth about \u00a3300m, but involving a complex structure and payments over many years. Titcomb declined to provide details of talks with Green, but said the regulator had to consider a range of factors in any pension deal. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about money, it may be about the structure of any deals,\u201d she said. Pushed by Frank Field, the chair of the select committee, about whether TPR could demand assets from Green, particularly his family\u2019s superyacht Lionheart, she said the regulator did not have the power to freeze assets and it would be for the courts to decide how to recover any unpaid legal demand. On the makeup of any settlement or willing payment from Green to a legal demand, she said: \u201cIf there is a settlement or financial support directive, then essentially what we are looking for there is some form of support for the scheme, which could be cash, guarantees or some other structure. \u201cThere is a great deal of flexibility there in terms of what could be taken into account. Having said that, whatever is proposed under either of these routes, we would have to be absolutely sure it is robust and doesn\u2019t create a continuing risk to either the members of the scheme or the PPF. For example, we would want to ensure that any assets that were offered would be properly valued. We wouldn\u2019t just take any offer.\u201d However, Green will almost certainly not offer the yacht as part of any settlement. If the courts are forced to chase cash from him, they can target a family empire estimated to be worth more than \u00a33bn, which includes property in London and the retail business Arcadia, which owns Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge. The courts could find it difficult to make legal claims on any of the Green family\u2019s assets, given that many of these are under the name of Lady Green and part of a network of offshore companies unconnected to BHS. Titcomb said: \u201cOur warning notices are targeted at certain targets, so the debt would be collected against these targets and the court would have to go through the normal process of assessing that target\u2019s assets.\u201d She said TPR was \u201crelentlessly\u201d pursuing the best possible outcome for the 20,000 members of the BHS pension scheme. Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the prospect of bailiffs seizing Green\u2019s yacht would be \u201cpeculiarly appealing\u201d to many people. He said: \u201cHis failure to offer the regulator a comprehensive and credible deal on the BHS pension scheme six months on from his promise to \u2018sort it out\u2019 has left no option but to pursue legal enforcement. \u201cThe process will take many months yet though and there is always the possibility that he will yet make an acceptable offer \u2013 just possibly the prospect of the bailiffs on the gangplank will focus his mind. In the meantime, the scheme members continue to enjoy the security of the PPF lifeboat scheme, with the hope that a better deal may eventually be secured on their behalf.\u201d",

Green, his family and other BHS shareholders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-philip-green-family-millions-administration-arcadia\">collected at least \u00a3580m</a> from the retailer, while Chappell\u2019s company Retail Acquisitions was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/10/pensions-regulator-seeks-millions-dominic-chappell-retail-acquisitions-bhs-pension-deficit\">paid an estimated \u00a317m</a>. </p> <p>TPR has started legal proceedings against Green, Chappell and their companies in an attempt to plug the pension deficit. It has issued warning notices to the former owners outlining why they are liable to support the pension scheme. </p> <p>Green and Chappell now have the opportunity to respond to the warning notices before a determinations panel, an independent body within TPR, decides how much they must contribute to the BHS pension scheme. The determinations panel ruling is a legal demand, but could be appealed all the way to the supreme court by Green and Chappell.</p> <p>Titcomb said the panel was unlikely to meet until the middle of next year and the \u201cdoor remains open\u201d to any settlement offers from Green.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4186426207d51dcee32086eea2c02d02a806d95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4186426207d51dcee32086eea2c02d02a806d95/0_78_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Philip Green's superyacht Lionheart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lionheart, Green\u2019s \u00a3100m superyacht, is among the tycoon\u2019s assets that could be seized, but this is unlikely.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Livorno Daily Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>TPR is understood be seeking at least \u00a3300m from Green and said it is yet to receive a \u201ccredible and comprehensive offer\u201d. The tycoon is understood to have offered a deal worth about \u00a3300m, but involving a complex structure and payments over many years. </p> <p>Titcomb declined to provide details of talks with Green, but said the regulator had to consider a range of factors in any pension deal. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about money, it may be about the structure of any deals,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Pushed by Frank Field, the chair of the select committee, about whether TPR could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/22/pensions-regulator-sir-philip-green-arcadia-bhs\">demand assets from Green</a>, particularly his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/09/superyachts-and-bragging-rights-why-the-super-rich-love-their-floating-homes\">family\u2019s superyacht Lionheart</a>, she said the regulator did not have the power to freeze assets and it would be for the courts to decide how to recover any unpaid legal demand.</p> <p>On the makeup of any settlement or willing payment from Green to a legal demand, she said: \u201cIf there is a settlement or financial support directive, then essentially what we are looking for there is some form of support for the scheme, which could be cash, guarantees or some other structure. </p> <p>\u201cThere is a great deal of flexibility there in terms of what could be taken into account. Having said that, whatever is proposed under either of these routes, we would have to be absolutely sure it is robust and doesn\u2019t create a continuing risk to either the members of the scheme or the PPF. For example, we would want to ensure that any assets that were offered would be properly valued. We wouldn\u2019t just take any offer.\u201d</p> <p>However, Green will almost certainly not offer the yacht as part of any settlement. If the courts are forced to chase cash from him, they can target a family empire estimated to be worth more than \u00a33bn, which includes property in London and the retail business Arcadia, which owns Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge.</p> <p>The courts could find it difficult to make legal claims on any of the Green family\u2019s assets, given that many of these are under the name of Lady Green and part of a network of offshore companies unconnected to BHS.</p> <p>Titcomb said: \u201cOur warning notices are targeted at certain targets, so the debt would be collected against these targets and the court would have to go through the normal process of assessing that target\u2019s assets.\u201d</p> <p>She said TPR was \u201crelentlessly\u201d pursuing the best possible outcome for the 20,000 members of the BHS pension scheme.</p> <p>Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the prospect of bailiffs seizing Green\u2019s yacht would be \u201cpeculiarly appealing\u201d to many people. </p> <p>He said: \u201cHis failure to offer the regulator a comprehensive and credible deal on the BHS pension scheme six months on from his promise to \u2018sort it out\u2019 has left no option but to pursue legal enforcement. </p> <p>\u201cThe process will take many months yet though and there is always the possibility that he will yet make an acceptable offer \u2013 just possibly the prospect of the bailiffs on the gangplank will focus his mind. In the meantime, the scheme members continue to enjoy the security of the PPF lifeboat scheme, with the hope that a better deal may eventually be secured on their behalf.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s vote for Brexit, Donald Trump\u2019s US election win and a slowdown in Chinese economic growth are combining to create significant risks for the global banking sector, a leading ratings agency warned on Wednesday. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s also included the low interest rate environment as posing potential hurdles for the banking industry\u2019s creditworthiness in its global credit outlook for the sector in 2017. More than half of the largest global banking systems face negative pressure, S&amp;P said, with more banks in Latin America and Asia Pacific appearing on the watch list. The UK is among 11 of the 20 largest global banking markets facing negative pressure. S&amp;P said: \u201cWeaker prospects for earnings growth globally, potential risks related to the UK\u2019s referendum vote to leave the EU, and more generally increased political risks are constraining factors for bank ratings in 2017.\u201d It added: \u201cA key constraint in our global credit outlook for banks relates to the path of the global economy, which is marked by a sluggish global growth underpinned by China\u2019s rebalancing, the adjustment of commodity exporters to new commodity prices, demographic factors inducing lower productivity growth and geopolitical and political uncertainty.\u201d Of the 85 banking systems assessed, 42% faced negative trends. The ratings agency said there were signs of \u201crenewed tremors\u201d from the result of the UK\u2019s EU referendum on 23 June while the election of Trump as US president showed that political risk remained significant. Some believe Trump could prove helpful for the banking sector, while the US stock market is at record highs on expectations that he will boost spending on the economy. \u201cThe policies of President-elect Trump\u2019s administration could represent the largest wildcard with the potential, at least over time, to meaningfully affect regulation, economic growth, interest rates, and ultimately bank performance,\u201d S&amp;P said. There could be knock-on effects in other parts of the world as a result, particularly in France and Germany, which are holding elections in 2017. \u201cBrexit may have energised broader, populist trends already pulsating through Europe. Citizens of other EU member states have expressed interest in holding referendums of their own to exit the union. Increasing populist sentiment, especially after the results of the US elections, also points to a shifting political landscape in the world\u2019s largest economies,\u201d S&amp;P said. This week Angela Merkel said she would run for a fourth term as German chancellor in next September\u2019s elections. In France polls show that the Front National leader, Marine Le Pen, will make it to the French presidential final round runoff next May, while the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has failed to be chosen as the rightwing Les R\u00e9publicains party\u2019s candidate for the presidency. The former PMs Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and Alain Jupp\u00e9 now face a second vote on 27 November to decide who will go up against Le Pen as the party\u2019s candidate. Anti-globalisation movements could affect growth prospects and S&amp;P is operating on the assumption that 2017 will be a year of sluggish growth across most developed and emerging markets. The European Central Bank could adopt a more relaxed approach to monetary policy while the US Federal Reserve could start to increase rates by a quarter percentage point in December and a half point in 2017.",

Roughly \u00a370m was wiped off the combined value of Foxtons and Countrywide after Philip Hammond confirmed a clampdown to prevent tenants from being forced to pay administrative costs for simple things such as inventory and reference checks. The move by Hammond to ban letting fees for people who rent their homes forms part of the government\u2019s ambition to do more for Britain\u2019s so-called \u201cJams\u201d \u2013 those families \u201cjust about managing\u201d.

David Cox, its managing director, said it would be counterproductive because the costs would be passed on to landlords who would, in turn, raise rents.

      "bodyText": "Austin Reed is returning to the high street seven months after the tailoring specialist collapsed into administration with the loss of 1,000 jobs. The retail chain\u2019s 120 stores closed in June, but new owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill is investing \u00a3100m in a relaunch. Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group bought the brand when it only had a handful of concessions. It plans to open 50 Austin Reed stores by early 2018, including a London flagship. The brand\u2019s website has relaunched and the first new stores are expected to open before the end of this year. The Country Casuals and Viyella brands, which the group bought along with Austin Reed, will be relaunched in Edinburgh Woollen Mills stores early next year. Austin Reed\u2019s customers included Winston Churchill and Elizabeth Taylor in its glory days, but the retail chain struggled for several years before going into administration in April. While the menswear market is growing faster than womenswear, Austin Reed has faced rising competition from Ted Baker, Reiss, Marks &amp; Spencer and a revived Moss Bros. The planned store openings were announced as Edinburgh Woollen Mill, which is privately owned by the Cumbria-based entrepreneur Philip Day, reported a 2.4% rise in sales to \u00a3576.3m in the year to 27 February. The group, which also owns fashion retailer Peacocks, homeware chain Ponden Mill and golfing brand ProQuip, said pre-tax profits before exceptional items increased by 2.4% to \u00a390.9m. All of the group\u2019s brands had achieved sales growth at established stores, it said. The company said it planned to open a total of 200 stores by early 2018. In the past year, the group opened 43 stores in the UK and Ireland. Steve Simpson, the group commercial director of Edinburgh Woollen Mill, said: \u201cBy focusing on quality and giving customers exceptional value for money and positive customer service, we have continued to grow despite increased competition. \u201cWith the addition of Austin Reed, which we acquired earlier this year, as well as Country Casuals and Viyella, we aim to continue this organic growth, while always being ready to respond to other opportunities as they arise.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook is to pay a dividend to shareholders for the first time in five years as it seeks to draw a line under a troubled period for the travel company. Shares rose 6.5% as the company described the payout as a \u201cmilestone\u201d moment. The travel industry has endured a year blighted by terrorism attacks in Europe and political instability in Turkey. Thomas Cook has also attempted to rebuild its reputation and change the culture of the business, after last year\u2019s inquest jury verdict of unlawful killing in relation to the the deaths in 2006 of two children from carbon monoxide poisoning during a holiday on the Greek island of Corfu. The travel company reassured consumers it did not expect the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote to make foreign holidays more expensive in the year ahead, and as a business it benefited because two-thirds of its revenue is made in other currencies. Peter Fankhauser, the company\u2019s chief executive, said that while it had been a tough year for the tourism industry, Thomas Cook had responded swiftly to challenges, switching to providing more holidays in Spain when demand plunged for destinations in Turkey. The company said it would pay investors a dividend of 0.5p a share, reflecting a confidence in strategy and a second consecutive year of profits. \u201cIt is modest but it is the first we\u2019ve paid in five years and it is a milestone for the business. In what\u2019s been a difficult year for tourism, it feels like Thomas Cook has come a long way in the last 12 months,\u201d Fankhauser said. Pre-tax profit dipped to \u00a342m in the year to 30 September from \u00a350m a year earlier, while revenue was roughly flat at \u00a37.8bn. He said the shock outcome of the UK\u2019s EU referendum had not had a noticeable impact on trading. Sales of holidays to Turkey halved over the year, and Fankhauser said the early signs for the summer 2017 holiday season were that customers were still favouring Spain and Greece, as well as longer-haul destinations including the US and Cuba. He said the company was changing its culture by focusing on providing a better service for customers following the deaths of Bobby and Christi Shepherd, aged six and seven, at a hotel on Corfu booked through the travel company. The siblings died from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a faulty boiler. A report commissioned by the company and published a year ago by the former Sainsbury\u2019s boss Justin King found that Thomas Cook had prioritised cost cuts over customers. The inquest jury said Thomas Cook had breached its duty of care to the children and their family. Fankhauser said on Wednesday: \u201cWe learned the hard way what happens when you don\u2019t put the customer at the heart of the business. \u201cRight across our business we\u2019re making customers\u2019 experience of our holidays better. By focusing on fewer hotels, we can have a bigger influence on quality and service, whether that\u2019s a promise to fix any issues within 24 hours or the reassurance of regular checks on health and safety standards.\u201d Summer 2017 bookings within its UK business were up 2%, and the company said it expected to remain profitable in the year ahead, maintaining market current expectations. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a cautious approach to the year ahead. We\u2019ve had an encouraging start to bookings for summer 2017 in our key markets, but it is early days,\u201d Fankhauser said. Thomas Cook said Condor, its German airline, would make a full-year loss of \u00a310m as a result of weak demand, especially for Turkey. Analysts at Stifel, said that overall it was an encouraging update, adding the shares had good recovery prospects.",

    "webTitle": "Path cleared for major Western Australia iron ore mine expansion", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Environmental Protection Authority has cleared the way for a threefold expansion of Andrew Forrest\u2019s Solomon iron ore mine which would see it remain in production for the next 35 years. But Western Australian authorities have raised concerns that a new field of water bores needed for the production could affect Hamersley Gorge, which is 4km south of the mine, in Karijini national park. Under the worst-case scenario, the report said, based on extracting 12 gigalitres of water a year for 30 years, there could be a 12% drop in the amount of water flowing into the gorge. The Solomon iron ore project is made up of two mines, Firetail and Kings, in the Hamersley Ranges about 1,500km northwest of Perth. It is 60km from Tom Price, the nearest town. The expansion approved by the EPA would require the clearing of an additional 12,146 hectares of native vegetation, on top of the 6,313 hectares cleared for the existing mine. The area to be cleared includes six hectares of Brockman iron ore cracking clay, a threatened ecological community and a habitat used by the endangered northern quoll and Pilbara leaf-nosed bat and vulnerable Pilbara olive python. It does not include a proposed $1.5bn project to build a new mine on the Eliwana or Nyidinghu deposits to replace the Firetail mine, which will run out of ore at current production rates by 2020. Fortescue Mining Group (FMG) has maintained that none of the proposed expansions would see the company increase its annual iron ore output, after Forrest accused rivals BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto of causing the iron ore price to crash by flooding the market. \u201cFortescue began seeking regulatory approval for sustaining production at Solomon several years ago as a procedural measure to achieve the necessary permits for ongoing mining operations,\u201d an FMG spokesman said. \u201cThe company has no current plans to increase production from the Solomon Hub.\u201d However, documents attached to the EPA application show it would allow for production to be increased to up to 80 million tonnes a year. Forrest called for a cap on iron ore production in the midst of a price slump in 2015, when the price fell to a six-year low to US$55 a tonne. He has criticised the expansion plans of heavyweights BHP and Rio Tinto and accused them of trying to squeeze out junior minors, of which FMG is the biggest by a considerable stretch, saying in 2015 that: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of one man against a couple of global giants, but I\u2019m after responsibility.\u201d The EPA imposed 19 conditions on the proposed expansion, including requirements to monitor the impact of putting in a new borefield which FMG said could see the groundwater drawn down from one metre to three metres over the 30-year life of the project. That in turn could affect nearby permanent waterholes on Weelumurra Creek, several of which are of Aboriginal cultural heritage significance, and groundwater-dependent vegetation. \u201cThe EPA notes that the proposal is not expected to result in impacts to Karijini national park given that groundwater drawdown would be contained within the mine development envelope for the proposal,\u201d the report said. The land clearing will remove 24% of the known stock of Gompholobium karijini, a yellow flowering shrub, and the cumulative impact of mining in the region has knocked out 89% of Triodia basitricha, a type of clumping grass. About 2% of the total land area of the Pilbara \u2013 371,300 hectares \u2013 has been cleared for mining. FMG has been ordered to pay an offset of between $750 and $3,000 a hectare for any new land cleared. The Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation (YAC), which represents a group that has a native title claim over the area and has a long, fraught relationship with FMG, has a longstanding opposition to the expansion, saying that accessing and developing the land without their approval is a breach of their traditional rights and customs. FMG was granted approval to work in the area without the YAC\u2019s cooperation after the relationship broke down over compensation arrangements. Another group who identify as Yindjibarndi, the Wirlu-Murra Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation, do work with FMG. \u201cFortescue is proud of the support we continue to provide to the Yindjibarndi community, through guaranteed jobs and training and business development opportunities,\u201d an FMG spokesman said.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of Heathrow\u2019s biggest customer, British Airways, only discovered that building the airport\u2019s planned third runway would require the demolition of his airline\u2019s head office after looking at a map. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA\u2019s parent company IAG, claimed that despite the group being responsible for about half of all flights at the London hub, he received no formal warning of the proposed demolition. He said: \u201cWe were never actually informed or advised by Heathrow that they intended to knock down our headquarters.\u201d Both IAG and British Airways are based at Waterside in Harmondsworth, which opened in 1998 at a cost of \u00a3200m and sits in a 115-hectare (280-acre) manmade park. Walsh said the HQ was \u201ca fantastic environmental achievement on our part\u201d. However, it looks unlikely to stay that way. \u201cThe first I saw of it was when the Airport Commission report came out and I saw a map and I thought, that looks very close to Waterside,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cThen I discovered it actually went right through Waterside.\u201d Walsh\u2019s grievance over his doomed HQ has been compounded by the prospect of being effectively charged for the compensation bill. While all properties in the path of the runway will be compulsorily purchased at 25% over the market price, the way Heathrow\u2019s charges are set by the Civil Aviation Authority means that airlines are likely to pay more to operate from the airport as expansion costs grow. Walsh said: \u201cThat compensation goes into the regulatory asset base and we end up paying 56% of that. \u201cWe can\u2019t have a situation where I end up paying for the destruction of my own head office.\u201d The Waterside affair may have contributed to apparent rising antipathy from Walsh towards Heathrow, which he lambasted as \u201cfat, dumb and happy\u201d at the Airport Operators Association conference in London. The IAG boss accused Heathrow of failing to hold proper discussions with airlines about creating a cost-effective airport and expansion plan. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think they have the capacity to engage. They\u2019ve never had to go out there and encourage airlines to operate from [Heathrow], unlike every other airport \u2026 Heathrow sits there fat, dumb and happy, waiting for the queue to build up.\u201d In approving Heathrow\u2019s expansion plans last month, the government said that increased domestic flights from around the UK would be a precondition. But Walsh stated that his airlines would not operate routes to airports such as Newquay in Cornwall, \u201ceven if [Heathrow chief executive] John Holland-Kaye got down and begged me\u201d. A Heathrow spokesperson said: \u201cBritish Airways has been consulted on the detail of our expansion plans throughout, including options for the relocation of Waterside ahead of the submission to the Airports Commission. \u201cWe are optimising our plans and are determined to work with our airlines to deliver them as cost efficiently as possible, which in turn will keep our airline charges as close to flat with today\u2019s charges as possible.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond is clearly keen to tell us he has a populist touch. Even George Osborne never issued a formal pre-announcement of the goodies in his bag. The new chancellor\u2019s approach takes the Treasury\u2019s news management operation to new heights (or depths, depending on your point of view) but Hammond has at least created a talking point by slapping a ban on the upfront fees letting agents charge their tenants. Everybody can applaud that measure \u2013 or, rather, everybody apart from the agents, but they have only themselves to blame. Upfront fees have become divorced from the costs of arranging a tenancy and are instead a means to gouge the tenant. London-based Foxtons charges \u00a3420 per tenancy, which is essentially a fee for printing out a standard letter and is ridiculous given the princely cut of the rent normally enjoyed by the agent. Foxtons and its ilk can, of course, attempt to recoup their \u00a3420 fees by pushing them onto landlords but one suspects they won\u2019t succeed in full. Landlords, who already pay the same fee for their own letters from Foxtons, are better equipped to negotiate or take their business elsewhere. Hammond\u2019s reform is pro-competition, which means the reform stands a better chance of making a small difference. Hammond\u2019s other selected highlights are less flashy. It\u2019s hard to know if \u201can additional \u00a31.4bn to deliver 40,000 affordable homes\u201d really amounts to \u201ca major housing package\u201d. The Treasury didn\u2019t bother to define the period in which the new homes will be built. But, in any case, central government intervention of some size was necessary. Data from the Department for Communities and Local Government showed last week that the number of affordable homes built in England in 2015-16 fell to its lowest level for 24 years. In that context, Hammond\u2019s new \u00a31.4bn may be merely a sticking plaster. A boost in the national living wage, which applies to workers aged 25 and over, from \u00a37.20 to \u00a37.50 is, perhaps, just good housekeeping. If Hammond is to make progress towards Osborne\u2019s target of \u00a39 by 2020, increases have to happen annually. But a 4.2% rise from April 2017 will delay for lower-paid workers the squeeze on real incomes that will arrive with the inflationary impact of a lower pound. One knock-on effect, of course, will be higher prices in pubs, bars, hotels and restaurants. Those operators must look after themselves but note the nuanced account offered by the pub and restaurant chain Mitchells &amp; Butlers on Tuesday. Its pre-tax profits, down by a quarter to \u00a394m in the past year, were impacted by wage inflation; on the other hand, it said competitive pressures have now reduced as the rate of openings of rival new restaurants has \u201cslowed considerably\u201d since the national living wage was introduced in July last year. That suggests the market is adapting quickly to the impact of higher wage bills. The picture is less clear among care homes and in the social care sector, where Hammond\u2019s concerns ought to be concentrated. Osborne introduced a voluntary 2% social care precept into the council tax bills to alleviate cost pressures but reports from local government suggest social care budgets are over-stretched, severely so in some cases. The official checklist of measures in Hammond\u2019s autumn statement contained no hint of further offsetting measures. Maybe they will follow, but one suspects not. The point of issuing edited highlights in advance is to try to maximise the applause so that the complaints are drowned out. Hammond is playing a grubby game. Maybe the rest of his bag contains some real horrors. Diageo, Unilever and Compass flat despite dollar\u2019s fizz The post-Brexit currency-fuelled fizz in the share prices of some of the FTSE 100 index\u2019s big dollar-earners is evaporating. Diageo went from \u00a318 to \u00a322 after the vote but now it is \u00a320. Unilever raced to \u00a336, now it\u2019s \u00a331.33, virtually where it stood on the day before the referendum. The same is true of contract caterer Compass Group \u2013 after hitting \u00a315, the shares have returned to \u00a313.26. What\u2019s going on? In part, president-elect Trump has changed the investment weather. If US infrastructure is now the thing, suppliers of raw materials to the construction industry are the place to be. The share prices of the big miners have been a roll for the past fortnight. The other half of the story is that dull but reliable consumer-related stocks like Diageo, Unilever and Compass weren\u2019t obviously bargains at their currency-inflated highs. Put another way, investors want to see more than just a translational currency boost. On that score, Compass had few fresh excitements to offer in its full-year numbers. Operating profit margins were flat at 7.2% and underlying operating profits rose 5.6% to \u00a31.44bn. The shares fell 5%. The reaction is churlish in the sense that Compass\u2019 dull reliability and steadily improving dividend (up 7.8%) are virtues. It remains a high-quality company that is likely to reward long-term owners via steady annual revenue growth of 4% to 6% plus strong cash generation. But it is rated at 22 times earnings. That is not cheap in any currency.",

But a 4.2% rise from April 2017 will delay for lower-paid workers the squeeze on real incomes that will arrive with the inflationary impact of a lower pound.</p> <p>One knock-on effect, of course, will be higher prices in pubs, bars, hotels and restaurants. Those operators must look after themselves but note the nuanced account offered by the pub and restaurant chain Mitchells &amp; Butlers on Tuesday. Its pre-tax profits, down by a quarter to \u00a394m in the past year, were impacted by wage inflation; on the other hand, it said competitive pressures have now reduced as the rate of openings of rival new restaurants has \u201cslowed considerably\u201d since the national living wage was introduced in July last year. That suggests the market is adapting quickly to the impact of higher wage bills.</p> <p>The picture is less clear among care homes and in the social care sector, where Hammond\u2019s concerns ought to be concentrated. Osborne introduced a voluntary 2% social care precept into the council tax bills to alleviate cost pressures but reports from local government suggest social care budgets are over-stretched, severely so in some cases. The official checklist of measures in Hammond\u2019s autumn statement contained no hint of further offsetting measures.</p> <p>Maybe they will follow, but one suspects not. The point of issuing edited highlights in advance is to try to maximise the applause so that the complaints are drowned out. Hammond is playing a grubby game. Maybe the rest of his bag contains some real horrors.</p> <h2>Diageo, Unilever and Compass flat despite dollar\u2019s fizz</h2> <p>The post-Brexit currency-fuelled fizz in the share prices of some of the FTSE 100 index\u2019s big dollar-earners is evaporating. Diageo went from \u00a318 to \u00a322 after the vote but now it is \u00a320. Unilever raced to \u00a336, now it\u2019s \u00a331.33, virtually where it stood on the day before the referendum. The same is true of contract caterer Compass Group \u2013 after hitting \u00a315, the shares have returned to \u00a313.26.</p> <p>What\u2019s going on? In part, president-elect Trump has changed the investment weather. If US infrastructure is now the thing, suppliers of raw materials to the construction industry are the place to be. The share prices of the big miners have been a roll for the past fortnight.</p> <p>The other half of the story is that dull but reliable consumer-related stocks like Diageo, Unilever and Compass weren\u2019t obviously bargains at their currency-inflated highs. Put another way, investors want to see more than just a translational currency boost. On that score, Compass had few fresh excitements to offer in its full-year numbers. Operating profit margins were flat at 7.2% and underlying operating profits rose 5.6% to \u00a31.44bn. The shares fell 5%.</p> <p>The reaction is churlish in the sense that Compass\u2019 dull reliability and steadily improving dividend (up 7.8%) are virtues. It remains a high-quality company that is likely to reward long-term owners via steady annual revenue growth of 4% to 6% plus strong cash generation. But it is rated at 22 times earnings. That is not cheap in any currency.</p>",
