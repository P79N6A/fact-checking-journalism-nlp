      "bodyText": "Britain is urging the World Bank to put together a long-term plan to meet the needs of refugees following a summer dominated by a migration crisis that has put strains on the European Union. Justine Greening, the international development secretary, told the bank\u2019s annual meeting in Lima that short-term emergency assistance was not enough and that a strategy was needed to provide schools, hospitals and work for those displaced. Speaking to the Guardian, Greening said the key to tackling migration was action to promote growth and development, and that this was a role for the bank. \u201cThis is a crisis that is not just going to clear itself up in one or two years,\u201d said Greening. \u201cIn the 1980s, the average time somebody would be a refugee was eight years; today it is 17-18 years.\u201d She added: \u201cThe World Bank has a bigger role to play in ensuring that refugees have the chance of getting a job, that their children can be educated, and that there is adequate health care. If we don\u2019t address these issues, it is not surprising that people try to find a better life for themselves.\u201d Greening said she had the support of other EU development ministers, and that she expected the bank\u2019s president, Jim Yong Kim, to come up with initial proposals for how his Washington-based organisation could do more. The communique issued after the meeting of the World Bank\u2019s development committee, which includes Greening, called on the bank to do more to tackle the refugee crisis. \u201cGiven the scale of the current refugee and migrant crisis, we call for targeted support, in collaboration with the UN and other partners, in addressing the challenges for countries and regions in turmoil, especially in the Middle East and North Africa, but also in other fragile and conflict states,\u201d said the committee, which consists of member-states\u2019 development ministers. \u201cThe bank is part of these discussions,\u201d said Greening. \u201cIt can play a role in analysing and assessing needs, and by putting in place a long-term strategy. More money will be needed, but that is a choice that has to be made. It is a choice between children growing up illiterate or growing up being able to read and write.\u201d Greening said the arrival in Europe this summer of people from Syria and Libya had underlined the importance of the UK\u2019s approach of promoting economic development so that people no longer felt the need to leave their own countries. The committee also echoed the warnings of the International Monetary Fund \u2013 that the global economy appears to be heading for a soft patch. \u201cGlobal growth remains weak, and the downside risks for the second half of 2015 and 2016 have risen,\u201d said the communique. \u201cA moderate recovery in high-income countries is still continuing, but prospects of tighter financing conditions, slowing trade and renewed weakness in commodity prices are weighing on confidence in many developing countries.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As a young student passionate about sport, Dr Brian Moore sold the former Olympic champion and co-founder of the London marathon Chris Brasher a pair of racing shoes in the 1990s. The young Irishman admired Brasher as a sporting hero but also as an athlete who improved his performance with minor adjustments, such as sketching his race number on to his vest in order to eliminate the drag caused by a pinned-on sign. Some two decades later and Moore is still focusing on the little things in order to improve sports performance. In his case, it is how analysing the blood of footballers, rowers and athletes can give them an edge over competitors, as well as indicating whether they face being sidelined or benched in the future because of health problems which may be preventable. Newcastle United, baseball and ice hockey teams in north America, and golfers Padraig Harrington and Graham McDowell are among the users of Moore\u2019s system of analysis. It scours blood samples for clues as to why an athlete may be underperforming and compares the results with a database of other athletes in the same field. Within five years, and through improvements in blood analysis, amateur sports enthusiasts who compete in 10km races and marathons will also be using the system to improve their training schedules ahead of a race, he claims. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t want is to spend 12 weeks training for the London marathon and then break down the week before it, or finish the marathon and not want to train again for another year. It is to help you get the best return on your hard work.\u201d Moore, now 39 years old but an eager athlete in his younger years, was studying PE and sports science at St Mary\u2019s University in London when he found differences in the blood of a non-athlete and an athlete as part of his dissertation, in effect creating a \u201cblood-specific sport profile\u201d. His research then expanded to Kenyan athletes and focused on how their iron levels were affected by altitudes and how they changed through the running season. \u201cWe were basically looking under the hood and seeing what happened with those systems and building up a picture of the whole athlete,\u201d he said. By spotting iron deficiencies, the athletes and their coaches could take action to resolve the problem before lethargy took hold and they were unable to perform. This was the beginning of Orreco, the analytics company Moore founded with Dr Andrew Hodgson, a consultant haematologist. After taking samples from athletes, the company subjects the blood to 40 general tests and then specific examinations depending on the sport. The data is analysed and compared against that of other athletes before the coach or team physician is given a report with suggested solutions if problems emerge. As athletes may have different average readings compared to the general population \u2013 for example vitamin D levels are generally higher \u2013 the sample is compared to other athletes in order to highlight inconsistencies. Dr Charles Pedlar, a sports physiologist with the company, said a biochemistry test can find levels of creatine kinase, an enzyme found in the muscles, which can highlight muscle damage. \u201cThere is a whole encyclopaedia involved with the one blood cell, if you have the right experts looking at the right area,\u201d he said. Elements of blood analysis are carried out by sports teams, says Moore, although not always as continuously or with the same data from 1,700 athletes to work with. A runner that the company worked with recently was found to have problems with their protein intake, a problem which had not been spotted by other medics as their tests had been undertaken using different criteria. In the case that a report is prepared for a manager or a physician, it is then down to the internal politics of the club as to how the results and the analysis are used. \u201cThe things that we are hearing is that the teams have so much data \u2013 there is no shortage of data. The challenge is how do you understand it, interpret it and action it,\u201d Moore said. \u201cSo, that is where we sit, really, it is to help people make sense of the data. Our anchor is around the biomarkers [a biological fingerprint] but really where we specialise is around the bioanalytics. And we have been able to do the modelling so we have found signals that are carried in the data in advance of athletes getting sick or injured.\u201d The sports the system has been used in include golf, Formula One motor racing, football, ice hockey, sailing, baseball, rowing and track and field events. The company, which is based in Sligo in the north west of Ireland and has offices in Galway, London and Boston, recently teamed up with IBM\u2019s Watson supercomputer project to create an app which uses Orreco\u2019s blood results for personalised training programs for individual athletes. Moore estimates that within five years the technology Orreco is working on will be available to the consumer in a similar way to wearable devices, such as the Fitbit and Garmin watches that record data for eager athletes. The information from blood samples could be used by someone training for a marathon or a 10km race to create a personally tailored training schedule, he said. Recent advances in blood testing, including work by US company Theranos, which replaces traditional testing with a simple finger prick test, could herald a system where health information is stored and used to tailor specific training regimes for amateur as well as professional athletes. \u201cWhat we do to help the elite athletes at the moment, I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t do that for everybody. The weekend warriors are really the obvious example of it but in time I think it will be about everybody. It is the consumer understanding of the choices that we make around what we eat, how we are sleeping, how we are living and how we are performing,\u201d Moore said. \u2022 You can read our archive of The Innovators columns here or on the Big Innovation Centre website, where you will find more information on how the centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Staff at Facebook\u2019s UK arm took home an average of more than \u00a3210,000 last year in pay and bonuses, while their employer paid just \u00a34,327 in corporation tax. Facebook made an accounting loss of \u00a328.5m in Britain in 2014, after paying out more than \u00a335m to its 362 staff in a share bonus scheme, according to the unit\u2019s latest published accounts. Operating at a loss meant that Facebook was able to pay less than \u00a35,000 in corporation tax to HM Revenue for the year. The share scheme was worth an average of more than \u00a396,000 for each member of staff. Once salaries were taken into account, a British employee of Facebook received more than \u00a3210,000 on average. The level of tax contribution by Facebook, which claimed in 2013 that at least a third of UK adults visited its site every day, will add to the debate about how to ensure that multinationals make fair tax payments in each country in which they operate. Last year, Facebook made a profit on its worldwide operations of $2.9bn (\u00a31.9bn), on revenue of $12.5bn. UK revenues were \u00a3105m last year. John Christensen, the director of campaign group the Tax Justice Network, said: \u201cit\u2019s very likely they\u2019re using all the usual techniques to shift profits around.\u201d A spokesperson for Facebook said: \u201cWe are compliant with UK tax law, and in fact in all countries where we have operations and offices. We continue to grow our business activities in the UK\u201d. She added that all the firm\u2019s employees paid UK income tax on their payouts. Facebook recently secured the lease on a high-profile 227,324 sq ft office space in Rathbone Square, near Tottenham Court Road in London, where it plans to open a new headquarters in 2017. George Osborne, the chancellor, has pledged to crack down on tax avoidance by global firms by swiftly legislating to enact a new set of rules drafted by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which has become a hub for global tax reform in recent years. The so-called BEPS rules are aimed at cracking down on \u201cbase erosion and profit-shifting\u201d: the practices used by many global firms to minimise their tax liabilities by recording profits in low-tax jurisdictions. The chancellor has repeatedly cut corporation tax, which is levied on company profits, but he insists that in exchange all firms must pay their fair share to the exchequer. The main corporation tax rate was 28% when Osborne arrived at the Treasury, and is 21% today. \u201cTaxes should be paid where profits are made,\u201d Osborne tweeted from the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meetings last week. \u201cGreat to see OECD BEPS rules agreed here in Lima. UK will lead by example and implement early\u201d. Separately, the chancellor has introduced a diverted profits tax, known as the \u201cGoogle tax\u201d, aimed at preventing hi-tech international firms from minimising their tax liabilities in the UK. Christensen said these developments were likely to have an impact on multinationals such as Facebook. \u201cThey will have to change their model. The Google tax will probably close off some opportunities, and the BEPS rules are certainly moving in the right direction.\u201d However, he criticised the fact that while the new framework will force firms to reveal to the authorities in their home country how much tax they pay in each jurisdiction in which they operate, that information will not be more widely available for public scrutiny. The social and economic power of Facebook and its fellow Silicon Valley technology firms has come under increasing scrutiny in recent months. Last week, the European court of justice struck down the 15 year old \u201csafe harbour\u201d pact, under which US-based companies were allowed to hold the data of European citizens. Fears about US surveillance activities, as revealed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, have intensified concerns about the role of Facebook and other social media platforms in safeguarding their users\u2019 privacy. Max Schrems, the Austrian privacy activist who brought the case, described it as a \u201cpuzzle piece in the fight against mass surveillance, and a huge blow to tech companies who think they can act in total ignorance of the law\u201d.",

So demands the unscrupulous banker, Mortimer Duke, when he finds he and his brother Randolph have been ruined by their speculative scam in the film Trading Places. Having lost all his money betting wrongly on orange juice futures, Mortimer demands that trading be restarted so that he can win it back. It\u2019s not known whether Christine Lagarde is a secret fan of John Landis movies. As a French citizen, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut might be more her taste. There is, though, more than a hint of Trading Places about the advice being handed out by Lagarde\u2019s International Monetary Fund to global policymakers. To Europe and Japan, the message is to print some more money. Keep those machines turned on, in other words. To the US and the UK, there was a warning that raising interest \u2013 something central banks in both countries are contemplating \u2013 could have nasty spillover effects around the rest of the world. Think long and hard before turning those machines off because you may have to turn them back on again before very long, Lagarde is saying, because the big risk to the global economy is not that six years of unprecedented stimulus has caused inflation but that the recovery is faltering. These are indeed weird times. Share prices are rising and so is the cost of crude oil, but the sense in financial markets is that the next crisis is just around the corner. The world is one recession away from a period of stagnation and prolonged deflation in which the challenge would be to avoid a re-run of the Great Depression of the 1930s. That fate was avoided in 2008-09 by strong and co-ordinated policy action: deep cuts in interest rates, printing money, tax cuts, higher public spending, wage subsidies and selective support for strategically important industries. But what would policymakers do in the event of a fresh crisis? Would they double down on measures that have already been found wanting or go for something more radical? Ideas are already being floated, such as negative interest rates that would penalise people for holding cash, or the creation of money by central banks that would either be handed straight to consumers or used to finance public infrastructure, also known as \u201cpeople\u2019s QE\u201d. Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, makes the point that since 2008, the main tool for stimulating activity has been monetary policy \u2013 a combination of lower interest rates, cheaper currencies and QE \u2013 but this is largely played out. Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank when Lehman Brothers went bust in 2008, believes that an over-reliance on ultra-loose monetary policy is creating the conditions for the next crisis. In many ways, this feels like the summer of 2007, before the markets froze up but when some of the malign consequences of the over-lax regulation of the financial markets were becoming apparent. It also bears some resemblance to the period in the late 1970s between the first and second oil shocks when what looked like a solid enough recovery was built on the shakiest of foundations. Back then, policymakers pulled all the levers they thought would see the return of non-inflationary growth only to find that the respite was brief. The inability of any part of the world economy to achieve sustainable escape velocity looks like a case of history repeating itself. Summers says the answer is to accept that fiscal policy \u2013 taxes and public spending \u2013 have a bigger role to play. In an article for the FT (paywall), Summers says that rules for annual budget deficits and government debt ratios should be rethought. \u201cLong-term low interest rates radically alter how we should think about fiscal policy. Just as homeowners can afford larger mortgages when rates are low, government can also sustain higher deficits.\u201d The IMF agrees. In a thinly disguised dig at Germany, it used last week\u2019s World Economic Outlook to call on those countries with capacity to loosen fiscal policy to boost demand. For the moment, these calls are likely to fall on deaf ears, but as quickly became clear in late 2008, orthodoxy goes out of the window in a crisis. Trichet thinks structural reform is the answer, although his paper is a bit hazy on what sort of changes he would like to see. Structural reform is certainly part of the solution, but not if it means a continuation of policies that are clearly not working. Three of the big structural changes to the global economy have brought us to the current parlous position. The first, as Charles Goodhart has explained in a recent paper for Morgan Stanley, is that the size of the global labour force expanded rapidly in the last quarter of the 20th century. In part this was due to demographics, with the baby-boomer generation increasing the working age population. In part, it was due to the advent of China and eastern Europe entering the global economy after 1990. If the supply of something rises, its price will fall. In the case of labour, that means wages have come under downward pressure. The abundance of cheap workers has meant companies have been able to substitute labour for capital, resulting in lower investment rates and a downward trend in global interest rates. Lower global interest rates have led to a second big change: the increased financialisation of the global economy, which has manifested itself in an enlarged role for banks, shadow banks and hedge funds; asset price bubbles; and rising debt levels. The squeeze on real wages has also meant weaker inflationary pressures, keeping interest rates low. It has been a golden age for independent central banks. This golden age is now at an end. The days when central banks could give the odd tweak to interest rates to keep inflation on target are over. Having told the world that they could fix the crisis, their reputations are on the line. Goodhart believes slower population growth and ageing populations will alter the balance of power in the labour market. Workers will become scarcer and more valuable. Wages will rise and companies will have the incentive to invest more, raising productivity. In contrast to Thomas Piketty, Goodhart thinks the outlook is for less inequality as labour\u2019s bargaining position relative to capital becomes stronger. But perhaps not yet. Ultra-loose monetary policy, together with tighter supervision of the financial sector, was supposed to minimise the risks of another crash while ensuring that plentiful supplies of cheap money boosted real activity. The opposite has occurred. Wages, productivity and growth have been poor even as investors have taken bigger and bigger risks in the search for high returns. In Trading Places, the Duke brothers get their just deserts. In real life, they have been allowed to take us to the brink of ruin for the second time in less than a decade.",

    "webTitle": "Economist Sir Richard Blundell frontrunners Nobel prize", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A British economist who made his name studying wages, taxes and household spending is among the frontrunners to win the economics Nobel prize when it is announced on Monday. Analysis by Thomson Reuters found that Sir Richard Blundell, the Ricardo professor of political economy at University College London, was cited in more academic papers over the last year than any other economist, indicating that his research on the impact of falling wages on consumer demand has proved hugely influential. Last year, the winner of the 8m Swedish krona (\u00a3630,000) award from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences was the Frenchman Jean Tirole, who is best known for his work analysing the monopolistic tendencies of big business. An economist at Toulouse University, Tirole was praised by the academy for providing regulators with a method to control sectors dominated by a few large businesses, using game theory. Blundell, also director of research at the tax and spending watchdog the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is another economist whose work is of practical application for policymakers. He has studied the impact of the tax credits system on work incentives, for example, and the knock-on effects of wages on household consumption. Blundell also served on the IFS\u2019s Mirrlees Review, a panel of top tax experts that sought to rewrite Britain\u2019s convoluted tax code for the 21st century. Economics was not one of the disciplines covered by the original prizes set up in Alfred Nobel\u2019s will, but the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was added to the roster in 1969, after a donation from the Swedish central bank. A number of other economists are also thought to be in the running for Monday\u2019s prize, which may be awarded to an individual, or a group of influential thinkers, as when Eugene Fama from the University of Chicago, his colleague Lars Peter Hansen and Yale\u2019s Robert Shiller won in 2013. Each of them had their own theories detailing the flaws in free market theory, but shared the prize. This year\u2019s other runners and riders include\u2026 Sir Anthony Atkinson and Angus Deaton: inequality, consumption and wellbeing This British duo were mentioned as possible winners last year when inequality became a hot subject following publication of Thomas Piketty\u2019s hit economics book Capital. A senior research fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford since 2005, Atkinson was a contributor to Piketty\u2019s book and has an inequality index named after him. His book Public Economics in an Age of Austerity was published last year. Always prolific, earlier this year Harvard University Press published his latest, Inequality: What Can Be Done?. Deaton is known for his work on health, wellbeing, and economic development. He is the Dwight D Eisenhower professor of economics and international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton. Bill Nordhaus, William Baumol, Sir Partha Dasgupta: environmental economics With only a month to go before the Paris climate change summit, could environmental science steal the 2015 prize? Nordhaus is an economics professor at Yale\u2019s school of forestry and environmental studies while Baumol, who is 93, works at New York State University where he has lobbied for the inclusion of environmental improvements in the national accounts. Dasgupta, an economics professor at Cambridge, asks why the natural environment is not considered an asset that is destroyed when it is concreted over. Ben S Bernanke, Frederic S Mishkin, Michael Woodford and Lars Svensson: inflation targeting by central banks The famous monetarist economist Milton Friedman wanted central banks to stick to the narrow task of keeping inflation low and stable, primarily by monitoring and manipulating the supply of money. In the 1990s, Bernanke, the recently retired boss of the US Federal Reserve, warned in a paper written with Mishkin that this limited remit would prevent central banks from rescuing troubled economies when inflation remained low. His work was influential in informing the wave of quantitative easing undertaken by central banks since the global financial crisis. It might be an odd moment to award the prize to Bernanke, whose legacy as a monetary policymaker is still under consideration.

William Baumol: health spending Baumol has also worked tirelessly to analyse health costs, which are escalating as western populations age. His hypothesis in 1966 suggested that the costs of education and healthcare would continue to rise in relative terms, creating a significant economic burden, something that has come to pass, especially in the US where health costs have almost reached 20% of GDP.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is planning a new logo to symbolise the bailed-out bank\u2019s retrenchment from globe-straddling institution to a slimmed-down operation in the wake of the banking crash. The bank hopes to partly repair its tarnished image by giving its corporate acronym a lower-case makeover by axing the bold RBS logo and replacing it with the more modest rbs. The NatWest name will also become more prominent in England and Wales under the proposals which are expected to see the scaled-back investment banking division rebadged as RBS Markets. As a result of the latest ideas, the distinctive blue RBS logo is expected to be stripped from the bailed-out bank\u2019s two flagship office buildings in the City of London and replaced with NatWest next year. The increased prominence of the NatWest brand in England and Wales is being forced upon the bank by the EU, which stipulated it must sell off branches as a result of its taxpayer rescue. These are the 300 RBS branches in England and Wales and a handful of NatWest branches in Scotland which from next year will be replaced by the Williams &amp; Glyn brand and listed on the stock market. RBS boss Ross McEwan has signalled that a branding exercise is being planned in recent presentations, pointing to the appointment of a new chief marketing officer. Last month, McEwan told a conference: \u201cStrong market positions will be held by all of our primary brands serving customers across all the markets we know we can win in. The appointment of our new chief marketing officer is a key first step in this and you will be hearing much more about this in 2016.\u201d Changes have already been made in Scotland where the full Royal Bank of Scotland name is used on high streets rather than the abbreviated version RBS appears to have scrapped ideas for renaming the bank, which was bailed out with \u00a345bn of taxpayer funds during 2008 and 2009 when global expansion and the takeover of Dutch bank ABN Amro left the bank\u2019s capital spread too thinly. RBS has also been tarnished by a wave of scandals, ranging from Libor and foreign exchange rigging to allegations of bad treatment of small business customers. Since taking over from Stephen Hester in October 2013, McEwan has focused the bank on the high street and intends to have a presence in 13 countries rather than the 51 in 2009. It is a step change from a decade ago when the RBS logo was aimed at a global audience \u2013 plastered on Formula One cars and greeting travellers arriving at Edinburgh airport. It remains to be seen what the implications are for its branding of the RBS Six Nations Championship. The exercise is in its early stages and the logo used by RBS \u2013 a four-cornered shape known internally as the daisy wheel \u2013 is likely to be removed from literature sent to investors and at corporate headquarters. However, it will remain on any customer-facing brand. A number of other changes are also thought to be under consideration, such as a new brand aimed at the mortgage market. RBS also has a number of other brands, including the upmarket bank Coutts. RBS said: \u201cWe are, and always have been, a bank of brands and as part of our strategy to build a stronger, simpler, fairer bank we are directing our efforts to make each of our customer brands number one in their respective markets. Our brands are our interface with our customers and through them we will be able to connect more deeply with customers and rebuild pride in the great things these brands do for our customers. The collective success of our brands is what will make us Britain\u2019s best bank.\u201d",

Don\u2019t hold your breath. Brito didn\u2019t even mention pricing in his consumer pitch.

But in the next few days \u2013 probably on Monday \u2013 AB InBev will put its real bid on the table. If it is \u00a345-a-share or more, the pressure on SAB chairman Jan du Plessis to agree terms will be intense.

      "bodyText": "Bill Gross, America\u2019s \u201cbond king\u201d, who made his fortune betting on IOUs from companies and governments, is suing his erstwhile employer for $200m, we learned last week. He says his colleagues were driven by greed and \u201ca lust for power\u201d. His chutzpah was a timely reminder of the vast sums won and lost in the world of globalised capital, but also of the power that still lies in the hands of men (they are mostly men) like Gross, who sit atop a system that remains largely untamed despite the lessons of the past seven years. To those caught up in it, America\u2019s sub-prime crash and its aftermath felt like a unique \u2013 and uniquely dreadful \u2013 chain of events, a financial and human disaster on an unprecedented scale. Yet it was just the latest in a series of periodic convulsions in modern capitalism, from the east Asia crisis to the Argentine default, to Greece\u2019s humiliation at the hands of its creditors. The first tremors of the next earthquake could be sensed by the central bankers and finance ministers gathered in Lima for the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meetings this weekend. Many were fretting about the knock-on effects of the downturn in emerging economies \u2013 led by China. Take a step back, though, and both the emerging market slowdown and the boom that preceded it are just the latest symptom of the ongoing malaise afflicting the global financial system. Seven years on from the Lehman collapse in September 2008, there has been some re-regulation \u2013 the Bank of England will soon announce details of the Vickers reforms, which will make banks split their retail arms from the riskier parts of their business \u2013 but many elements of the financial architecture remain unchallenged. Capital swills unchecked around the world; governments feel compelled to prioritise the whims of international investors such as Gross \u2013 who tend to have a neoliberal bent \u2013 over the needs of domestic businesses; and credit ratings agencies remain all-powerful, despite their dismal record. The theory behind free-flowing capital is that it allows the world\u2019s savings to find the most profitable opportunities \u2013 even far from home \u2013 and provides the impetus for investment and entrepreneurialism, aids economic development and boosts growth. Yet as Unctad, the UN\u2019s trade and development arm, detailed in its annual report last week, the reality is very different. Capital flows are often driven more by the global financial weather than by the investment prospects in emerging economies; they can be disproportionately large; and they can change abruptly with the market mood, overwhelming domestic efforts to promote stable development. Recent IMF research found that a quadrupling of corporate loans in emerging economies over the decade to 2014 was driven mainly by international factors \u2013 most obviously the flood of cheap money from central banks as they fought to reflate western economies. This may have financed productive projects, but it left firms vulnerable to a shift in conditions \u2013 such as an increase in global interest rates, or a \u201csudden stop\u201d, when capital is abruptly withdrawn. Emerging markets as a bloc are expected to suffer a net capital outflow this year for the first time since 1988 as investors seek to protect themselves from plunging commodity prices and anticipate higher US interest rates. The IMF warned governments to be prepared for a flurry of corporate failures as the tide turns, and warned that corporate losses could quickly hit banks\u2019 balance sheets. This would prompt them to rein in lending and could unleash a new credit crunch in emerging markets. Unctad argues that as well as inflating bubbles, an indigestible influx of capital can strengthen a country\u2019s currency to the point where local industries are unable to compete with cheap imports. Policymakers in economies heavily dependent on external capital can also be tempted to keep interest rates high as they pander to the demands of global investors for low, stable inflation. Unctad bemoans the \u201clost opportunities for growth and for an expansion of higher-quality employment\u201d. Separate research has found that a big banking sector tends to pump up credit bubbles, rather than funnelling investment into long-term projects that boost productivity and ultimately foster sustainable growth. Stephen Cecchetti, of the Bank for International Settlements, has suggested that this may be because finance favours industries that have tangible assets they can pledge as collateral (such as property), rather than \u201chigh research and development intensity\u201d, which may take longer to bear fruit. Unctad\u2019s experts would like to see new global rules that would, among other things, allow governments to erect barriers against hot money flows, clip the wings of ratings agencies and establish a formal, fair mechanism allowing countries to go bankrupt. It would also like to see governments in rich countries focus on boosting wages to increase domestic demand, instead of relying on debt-fuelled growth. Others warn that a more radical approach may be necessary, to break the cycle in which healthy expansion always brings with it a credit bubble. Adair Turner, who witnessed the credit crunch first hand as chairman of the Financial Services Authority, has become increasingly vocal in arguing that some of the global debt mountain may have to be written off; or financed directly by central banks, Corbynomics-style. He may well be right: but as a fresh crisis looms, it must be time to tame global capital and make it work for all the world\u2019s citizens, not just for Gross and his fellow titans of finance.",

      "body": "<p>Bill Gross, America\u2019s \u201cbond king\u201d, who made his fortune betting on IOUs from companies and governments, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/08/billionaire-bill-gross-sues-firm-he-founded-40-years-ago-for-200m\" title=\"\">suing his erstwhile employer for $200m</a>, we learned last week. He says his colleagues were driven by greed and \u201ca lust for power\u201d.</p> <p>His chutzpah was a timely reminder of the vast sums won and lost in the world of globalised capital, but also of the power that still lies in the hands of men (they are mostly men) like Gross, who sit atop a system that remains largely untamed despite the lessons of the past seven years.</p> <p>To those caught up in it, America\u2019s sub-prime crash and its aftermath felt like a unique \u2013 and uniquely dreadful \u2013 chain of events, a financial and human disaster on an unprecedented scale. Yet it was just the latest in a series of periodic convulsions in modern capitalism, from the east Asia crisis to the Argentine default, to Greece\u2019s humiliation at the hands of its creditors.</p> <p>The first tremors of the next earthquake could be sensed by the central bankers and finance ministers gathered in Lima for the International Monetary Fund\u2019s annual meetings this weekend. Many were fretting about the knock-on effects of the downturn in emerging economies \u2013 led by China.</p> <p>Take a step back, though, and both the emerging market slowdown and the boom that preceded it are just the latest symptom of the ongoing malaise afflicting the global financial system.</p> <p>Seven years on from the Lehman collapse in September 2008, there has been some re-regulation \u2013 the Bank of England will soon announce details of the Vickers reforms, which will make banks split their retail arms from the riskier parts of their business \u2013 but many elements of the financial architecture remain unchallenged.</p> <p>Capital swills unchecked around the world; governments feel compelled to prioritise the whims of international investors such as Gross \u2013 who tend to have a neoliberal bent \u2013 over the needs of domestic businesses; and credit ratings agencies remain all-powerful, despite their dismal record.</p> <p>The theory behind free-flowing capital is that it allows the world\u2019s savings to find the most profitable opportunities \u2013 even far from home \u2013 and provides the impetus for investment and entrepreneurialism, aids economic development and boosts growth.</p> <p>Yet as Unctad, the UN\u2019s trade and development arm, detailed <a href=\"http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/tdr2015_en.pdf\" title=\"\">in its annual report last week</a>, the reality is very different.
