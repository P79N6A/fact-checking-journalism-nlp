    "webTitle": "BAE closure of Portsmouth shipyard prompts political row", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The coalition has been accused of sacrificing Portsmouth's 500-year-old shipbuilding tradition to save the industry in Glasgow before Scotland's independence referendum, as it unveiled plans for almost 1,800 job losses in the two cities. Philip Hammond, the Conservative defence secretary, said it was \"regrettable but inevitable\" that BAE Systems' Portsmouth site would have to close, as there would no longer be enough orders to sustain two major military shipyards in the UK. The closure in Portsmouth removes the immediate threat of closure from Glasgow's Scotstoun and Govan yards, although 835 jobs will be lost at those sites as well as at two other locations, in Fife and Bristol. These will be kept open to build three patrol boats while they wait to begin construction on millions of pounds' worth of type 26 warships in 2015. However, ministers faced claims that they were playing politics with UK jobs as Alistair Carmichael, the Scottish secretary, said it would be difficult to award the type 26 work to Scotland if the country voted to leave the UK in 2014. BAE will cut 1,775 jobs in total once its construction of two multibillion-pound aircraft carriers is completed. While Glasgow's two major yards have been protected, shipbuilding will end for good in Portsmouth, with the loss of 940 jobs, bringing the curtain down on a centuries-old industry in the city that built the Tudor warship the Mary Rose. In the House of Commons on Wednesday the defence secretary tried to put a positive spin on the announcement, saying \u00a3100m would be spent on upgrading and repairing the naval base at Portsmouth. The city will soon be home to the HMS Queen Elizabeth, HMS Prince of Wales and type 45 destroyers. The government said the decision to close Portsmouth had been taken by the company alone \"on the basis of industrial logic\" as BAE Systems \u2013 the UK's largest defence contractor \u2013 said Glasgow was the best location for building the type 26. The move was largely backed by Labour, although the party said it needed to \"take time to fully examine the consequences\". However, several MPs in the south claimed the government was behind the decision, arguing that Portsmouth had suffered from a political calculation that jobs could more easily afford to be lost in the south than in Glasgow, whose voters are crucial to the outcome of the Scottish referendum next year. Mike Hancock, the independent MP for Portsmouth South, said his constituents had paid a \"very heavy price for a slightly cynical manoeuvre\", while John Denham, the Labour MP for Southampton Itchen, said southern England has been \"sold downriver while the government looks elsewhere\". Some Tories questioned whether there had been a tradeoff, with Caroline Dinenage, the MP for Gosport, saying she thought Portsmouth jobs had been sacrificed. \"The fact that Scottish jobs have been protected at the expense of those on the south coast, which is an area of equal economic need, for us is devastating and very upsetting,\" she said. While the decision to save the Glasgow shipyard could help the campaign for Scotland to stay part of the UK, the closure of Portsmouth's site also does not bode well for the electoral prospects of Penny Mordaunt, MP for Portsmouth North, who has a majority of just over 7,000. Mordaunt, a Royal Navy reservist and aide to the defence secretary, has written to BAE Systems to ask why some of the patrol vessels cannot be built in Portsmouth when the city asked for two ships to be built there. Pressed on the issue of English versus Scottish jobs, Hammond said the losses were a \"harsh blow\" but the decision had been made in the national interest. He stressed that the redundancies in Portsmouth should be seen in light of the 11,000 remaining jobs in the city's ship maintenance industry. It is understood that Vince Cable, the business secretary, has worked with Hammond to provide a support package to Portsmouth and the surrounding area, with aides promising more to come. Vernon Coaker, Labour's shadow defence secretary, said he wanted to know what bearing the independence poll had had on the decision and what would happen to the industry if Scottish votes to leave the UK. Asked about the issue, David Cameron's official spokesman said: \"This is a government that always takes decisions based on the national interest. This decision was taken with a view of how we have the best-equipped, best-maintained Royal Navy.\" The prime minister himself said it had been an \"extremely difficult decision\" for BAE to close the Portsmouth shipyard, but promised there would still be a lot of work in the city maintaining ships for \"many, many years to come\". As he explained the closures and job losses, Hammond was also quizzed on the costs of the aircraft carrier programme as he confirmed that the bill had risen by a further \u00a3800m to \u00a36.2bn. He said the increase had not come as a surprise and he could not guarantee that the bill would not rise further. Turning his fire on the opposition, Hammond blamed the previous government for placing an order for the aircraft carriers without a final design. The first of the carriers, Queen Elizabeth, is due to begin sea trials towards the end of the decade. A decision will not be taken until 2015 about whether the second carrier, Prince of Wales, will ever be operational; it could be sold or mothballed. The carriers were built by a consortium that included BAE.",

      "body": "<p>The coalition has been accused of sacrificing Portsmouth's 500-year-old shipbuilding tradition to save the industry in Glasgow before Scotland's independence referendum, as it unveiled plans for almost 1,800 job losses in the two cities.</p> <p>Philip Hammond, the Conservative defence secretary, said it was \"regrettable but inevitable\" that BAE Systems' Portsmouth site would have to close, as there would no longer be enough orders to sustain two major military shipyards in the UK.</p> <p>The closure in Portsmouth removes the immediate threat of closure from Glasgow's Scotstoun and Govan yards, although 835 jobs will be lost at those sites as well as at two other locations, in Fife and Bristol. These will be kept open to build three patrol boats while they wait to begin construction on millions of pounds' worth of type 26 warships in 2015.</p> <p>However, ministers faced claims that they were playing politics with UK jobs as Alistair Carmichael, the Scottish secretary, said it would be difficult to award the type 26 work to Scotland if the country voted to leave the UK in 2014.</p> <p>BAE will cut 1,775 jobs in total once its construction of two multibillion-pound aircraft carriers is completed. While Glasgow's two major yards have been protected, shipbuilding will end for good in Portsmouth, with the loss of 940 jobs, bringing the curtain down on a centuries-old industry in the city that built the Tudor warship the Mary Rose.</p> <p>In the House of Commons on Wednesday the defence secretary tried to put a positive spin on the announcement, saying \u00a3100m would be spent on upgrading and repairing the naval base at Portsmouth. The city will soon be home to the HMS Queen Elizabeth, HMS Prince of Wales and type 45 destroyers.</p> <p>The government said the decision to close Portsmouth had been taken by the company alone \"on the basis of industrial logic\" as BAE Systems \u2013 the UK's largest defence contractor \u2013 said Glasgow was the best location for building the type 26. The move was largely backed by Labour, although the party said it needed to \"take time to fully examine the consequences\".</p> <p>However, several MPs in the south claimed the government was behind the decision, arguing that Portsmouth had suffered from a political calculation that jobs could more easily afford to be lost in the south than in Glasgow, whose voters are crucial to the outcome of the Scottish referendum next year.</p> <p>Mike Hancock, the independent MP for Portsmouth South, said his constituents had paid a \"very heavy price for a slightly cynical manoeuvre\", while John Denham, the Labour MP for Southampton Itchen, said southern England has been \"sold downriver while the government looks elsewhere\".</p> <p>Some Tories questioned whether there had been a tradeoff, with Caroline Dinenage, the MP for Gosport, saying she thought Portsmouth jobs had been sacrificed.</p> <p>\"The fact that Scottish jobs have been protected at the expense of those on the south coast, which is an area of equal economic need, for us is devastating and very upsetting,\" she said.</p> <p>While the decision to save the Glasgow shipyard could help the campaign for Scotland to stay part of the UK, the closure of Portsmouth's site also does not bode well for the electoral prospects of Penny Mordaunt, MP for Portsmouth North, who has a majority of just over 7,000.</p> <p>Mordaunt, a Royal Navy reservist and aide to the defence secretary, has written to BAE Systems to ask why some of the patrol vessels cannot be built in Portsmouth when the city asked for two ships to be built there.</p> <p>Pressed on the issue of English versus Scottish jobs, Hammond said the losses were a \"harsh blow\" but the decision had been made in the national interest.</p> <p>He stressed that the redundancies in Portsmouth should be seen in light of the 11,000 remaining jobs in the city's ship maintenance industry. It is understood that Vince Cable, the business secretary, has worked with Hammond to provide a support package to Portsmouth and the surrounding area, with aides promising more to come.</p> <p>Vernon Coaker, Labour's shadow defence secretary, said he wanted to know what bearing the independence poll had had on the decision and what would happen to the industry if Scottish votes to leave the UK.</p> <p>Asked about the issue, David Cameron's official spokesman said: \"This is a government that always takes decisions based on the national interest.

While at the same time, European domestic gas production continues to decline.</p> <p>\"We are therefore hopeful that the serious loopholes and inconsistencies in energy and climate-change policies will be addressed and corrected soon to encourage long-term investment in gas infrastructure and enhance the energy security of Europe.\"</p>",

Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, said: \"We are delighted that we continue to deepen our relationship with Qatargas and continue to build our LNG business by integrating our positions along the gas value chain. \"It is vital that the UK has a diverse range of sources of supply to meet its energy requirements. In a competitive international market, contracts like this underpin the UK's access to global LNG supplies for the benefit of customers.\" Michael Fallon, the energy minister, said: \"Long-term deals of this kind, with reliable suppliers like Qatar, are vital for our future energy security.\" The UK's vulnerability over imported gas was flagged up this year when technical problems with one of the main pipelines into the UK caused a temporary shutdown. The pipeline quickly reopened but the incident highlighted the fact that the UK had few gas storage facilities and frequently only a few days' supply of gas to hand. Given the running down of the North Sea gas fields, the widespread dependency on the fuel for heating and for power generation, which is only set to increase, any fresh technical problems at the UK's supply pipelines could lead to renewed concerns. The government this year turned down an application for public money for a new gas storage facility. Khalid Bin Khalifa Al Thani, chief executive of Qatargas, told an energy conference in Singapore last week that the market for gas in Europe had been sluggish because of the effects of the recession. He said: \"The continued economic slowdown, coupled with the impact of European energy and climate-change policies and their unintended effects on the energy markets, has seriously dampened and even reversed in some cases the growth of gas consumption that was achieved in the continent during the last decade. \"There is no doubt that the European economies will start recovering in the near future and consequently gas consumption growth will return. While at the same time, European domestic gas production continues to decline. \"We are therefore hopeful that the serious loopholes and inconsistencies in energy and climate-change policies will be addressed and corrected soon to encourage long-term investment in gas infrastructure and enhance the energy security of Europe.\"",

      "bodyText": "Debenhams has become the first department store to display size 16 mannequins in its shops, in an effort to reflect the shape of real women in Britain. The retailer urged rival high street shops to follow its lead as it announced that larger models would be used in its 170 stores around the UK. The introduction of size 16 mannequins comes just two months after the equalities minister Jo Swinson called for fashion stores to promote a more diverse range of women, saying it was \"as if there's only one way of being beautiful\". Nearly all clothes shops in Britain use size 10 or size 8 mannequins, including Topshop and Miss Selfridge, even though the average British woman is a size 16. Debenhams director Ed Watson said: \"The average British woman is a size 16, but the high street has been showing them clothing on a mannequin that is three sizes smaller \u2013 until now. \"Having worked on this project for three years, we hope that it will help people in some small way to feel comfortable about their bodies and, crucially, that other retailers will follow.\" However, there was a lukewarm response from rival outlets. A spokeswoman for the British Retail Consortium said it was down to each individual store whether to display plus-size models. \"We won't be issuing guidance in the short term but it's an issue UK retailers take very seriously,\" she said. A spokesman for Marks &amp; Spencer said it takes a \"responsible approach to visual merchandising\" and pointed out that it uses size 10 models, which is above the size 8 market average. Arcadia Group, the retail giant behind chains including BHS, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge, did not return a request for a comment. Swinson said: \"Many customers want to see more realistic images in magazines, TV and on the high street, and having mannequins that reflect and celebrate our diverse society is one way of helping to achieve this.\" It is not the first time that Debenhams has defied conventional fashion promotion. The department store promoted its Principles range in 2010 with a disabled model, and more recently has banned airbrushing on swimwear advertising and run a lingerie campaign featuring a model over 50.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Asda is marshalling a group of snowmen to attack its rivals on price this Christmas. The supermarket's seasonal TV advert, which launches during X Factor on ITV this weekend, features thin, sad snowmen decked in yellow, blue and orange scarves to represent its three rivals, Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury's, while a tall happy green-hatted Asda snowman stands out from the crowd. A narrator suggests that shoppers should see the snowmen as representing potential savings, highlighting an Asda promotion which offers prices 10% cheaper than rivals. The retailer says it had spent 10% less on its \"no gimmicks\" media plan this year and would be investing those savings in lower prices. The unusual move to attack rivals in a Christmas campaign, when most ads look to set a cheerful mood, comes amid heavy competition between the big four supermarkets, who are nearly all seeing market share stolen by either discounters such as Aldi or quality specialists such as Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer. Steve Smith, chief marketing officer, said: \"We think it's more important to invest money directly into lowering the prices of all our products instead of producing costly campaigns that just keep the ad guys happy.\" Asda parted company with the agency which created last year's Christmas advert, which showed a mum struggling to prepare for Christmas. It drew 620 complaints to the advertising watchdog, most of which claimed it was sexist. Ben Fennell, chief executive of creative agency BBH which produced Waitrose's recent Christmas campaigns, said an attacking ad risked putting off shoppers. \"It's our long-held belief that its better to talk about your strengths as a brand rather than highlight others' perceived weaknesses. Negative advertising doesn't get the consumer response you want,\" he said. But Asda isn't the only supermarket looking to try a different angle this Christmas. While Aldi and Lidl are both flagging up luxury goods, Sainsbury's, which launches its Christmas campaign next week, is also expected to avoid glitz while Waitrose has focused on its charitable efforts for the second year running. Fennell said: \"Historically brands put their best foot forward with glitzy spectaculars but those are increasingly seen as out of step with the times.\" The supermarkets are all set to launch their TV ad campaigns in the next week after other major stores including Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams and John Lewis kick off their campaigns this week. M&amp;S got an early start by previewing its Believe in Magic &amp; Sparkle ad on social media sites including Facebook on Monday and its ad will screen on television for the first time on Wednesday night.",

This issue roared up the agenda last week when <a href=\"http://www.dw.de/german-exports-skewing-trade-us-report-says/a-17197306\"><strong>the US Treasury took the rare step of identifying Germany's export success as a threat to world economic stability</strong></a>.</p> <p>Wolf writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Surplus countries import the demand they do not generate internally.</p> <p>When global demand is buoyant, this need not be a problem provided the money borrowed by deficit countries is invested in activities that can subsequently service the debts they are incurring.</p> <p>Alas, this does not happen often, partly because the deficit countries are pushed by the supply of cheap imports from surplus countries towards investing in non-tradeable activities, which do not support the servicing of international debts.</p> <p>But in current conditions, when short-term official interest rates are close to zero and demand is chronically deficient across the globe, the import of demand by the surplus country is a \u201cbeggar-my-neighbour\u201d policy: it exacerbates this global economic weakness.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wolf then tries to blows down what he sees as another German fairytale, that the rest of the eurozone can learn from the Mittelstand&#xa0;and export their way to success:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It will be impossible, however, for the eurozone to achieve prosperity on the basis of export-led growth: it is too large to do so. It has to achieve internal rebalancing, as well. Hitherto,<a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2013/02/pdf/c1.pdf\"> as the&#xa0;IMF\u2019s October World Economic Outlook&#xa0;shows</a>, it is mass shedding of labour that has raised competitiveness, and collapsing domestic demand that has reduced external deficits in the crisis-hit countries.</p> <p>Thus the adjustment successes have been the other side of the coin of economic slumps and soaring unemployment. Yet, even so, the IMF does not forecast significant reductions in net liability positions. Their vulnerability will endure.</p> <p data-track-pos=\"4\">So what, in brief, is happening? The answers are: creeping onset of deflation; mass joblessness; thwarted internal rebalancing and over-reliance on external demand.</p> </blockquote> <h2>The full piece is here (<em>FT paywall permitting....</em>): <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/291a5ca6-42ec-11e3-8350-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2jgdWFq7y\"><strong>Germany is a weight on the world&#xa0;</strong></a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/martinwolf_/statuses/397789798230130688\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Germany is a weight on the world <a href=\"http://t.co/snGixNyCLG\">http://t.co/snGixNyCLG</a></p>&mdash; Martin Wolf (@martinwolf_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinwolf_/statuses/397789798230130688\">November 5, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28616043\">There's also a discussion on the issue in the reader comments below</a>:&#xa0;</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-527a4a72e4b0625ea40a9be7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-06T14:04:41.346Z\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>BAE System's plan to cut almost 1,800 jobs across its UK sites has dampened the optimism generated by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/06/greece-hit-by-another-anti-austerity-strike-business-live#block-527a0c4ae4b00d1cb16447f8\"><strong>this morning's strong industrial output data</strong></a>.</p> <p>The impact of&#xa0;ending 500 years of shipbuilding in Portsmouth won't be seen in the data for a while.

The final reading of the October Eurozone PMI came in above the flash estimate, but still fell compared with September to signal an easing in the already- modest pace of expansion. The survey signals a mere 0.2% quarterly growth rate at the start of the fourth quarter, unchanged on the third quarter.</p> <p>\u201cThe loss of momentum raises concerns that the upturn is faltering and piles further pressure on the European Central Bank to reinvigorate the recovery, especially as a drop in inflation to a near four-year low of 0.7% \u2013 well below the ECB\u2019s target rate of 2.0% \u2013 has raised concerns about deflation taking hold.</p> <p>\u201cThe case for renewed stimulus is by no means clear cut, however, as policymakers will note that the economy has shown a major turnaround so far this year. Having signalled a steep rate of contraction during the early months of 2013, the PMI has indicated growth in each of the past four months, and expansion is now being seen across the board in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Most impressive is the surging pace of growth seen in Ireland, where growth is the strongest since 2006.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-06T09:31:55.954Z\">at 9.31am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-527a04ece4b05943043c39c8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-06T09:22:17.523Z\">9.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone private sector recovery slips</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The eurozone's economic recovery lost some pace last month, according to Markit's closely watched survey of businesses across the region.</strong></p> <p>&#xa0;Its Service Sector PMI, which measures activity of thousands of firms, dropped to 51.6 in October from 52.2 in September.

      "bodyText": "With Greece's 24-hour general strike grinding towards a close, it's time to wrap up. A quick recap. \u2022 Greek workers have held another general strike in protest at the country's austerity programme. School staff, hospital employees, and transport workers all stopped work, bringing parts of the country to a standstill. A reminder that, after five years of recession, anger over Greece's \"reform programme\" has not dissipated. Here's a full report.... and here's a list of what was hit. \u2022 However, plans for a mass anti-austerity rally outside the Athens parliament were cancelled after heavy rain. Photos and video here...... and here.....and also here. \u2022 The latest economic data from the eurozone showed that private sector growthslowed last month, fuelling fears that Europe's recovery is losing momentum. \u2022 In Britain, manufacturing output has jumped... \u2022 ... but UK industry was hit by job cuts at BAE Systems. Analysis here Back tomorrow, when the European Central Bank must decide whether to react to recent worrying euro area data by cutting interest rates. Until then, cheers, and thanks for the comments (as ever). GW Ahead of the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday - where some analysts think a rate cut is possible - and the US non-farm payrolls on Friday, European markets moved mostly higher. An exception was the UK where continuing strong data point up the prospect of an earlier than expected rate rise. The scores on the doors: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished down 5.15 points or 0.08% at 6741.69 \u2022 Germany's Dax ended 0.35% higher at 9040.87 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.79% better at 4286.93 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB added 0.89% to 19,262.51 \u2022 Spain's Ibex climbed 0.42% to 9837.1 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new high in early trading but has fallen back from its peak. It is currently up 0.55% or 86 points. Global economic activity rose last month to a 32-month high, according to JP Morgan and Markit who have crunched through the various surveys of manufacturing and service sector data released over the last week or so. Their Global October Composite PMI rose to 55.5, from 53.6 in September, accelerating away from the 50 point mark that separates expansion from contraction. That's despite this morning's eurozone PMI data suggesting growth slowed last month (see here). Britain led the way, having reported the biggest jump in service sector activity since May 1997: The UK remained the strongest performer overall, with the rate of expansion in all-industry output ticking higher to its sharpest since at least July 1996. Japan also reported a substantial series-record pace of growth, while rates of increase also improved in China, Brazil, Russia and Ireland. The recovery in the eurozone entered its fourth successive month in October. However, the pace of expansion eased slightly, as strong growth in Ireland and steady rates of increase in France and Germany were offset by a growth slowdown in Italy and broad stagnation in Spain. David Hensley, Director of Global Economics Coordination at JPMorgan, reckons the PMI data shows the global economy \"started the final quarter on a positive footing\": All-industry output accelerated October, indicating that global GDP is on track to post a decent outcome in Q4. The broad-base of the upturn across manufacturing output and services activity is encouraging. Here's the full release. This photo sums up the situation in Greece today, where the weather put paid to plans of a big anti-austerity rally at Syntagma Square: Given public anger over the troika, I guess another opportunity will come along soon.... The row over the Co-operative bank's decline and fall is taking another twist -- its former chairman is saying political interference played a part in its woes. Paul Flowers, who quit after the discovery of a \u00a31.5bn capital black hole sank its bid for hundreds of Lloyds branches, is testifying at the Treasury select committee. He told MPs that a series of senior Westminster figures were keen for the Co-op to expand. That looks less than astute, given we now know the bank was struggling with its IT systems after merging with the Britannia Building Society, and in need of extra funds. Our City editor Jill Treanor tweets the highlights: UK economic growth probably slowed slightly in October, according to the latest monthly forecast from the NIESR thinktank. NIESR predicts that Britain's economic outlook grew by 0.7% in the three months to October, lower than the 0.8% growth seen in the July-September quarter. If NIESR are right (and their forecasts are usually pretty accurate), this means the current level of GDP is now 5.6% above the trough of the 2008-9 recession, but still 2.3% below its pre-recession peak. It's still the slowest recovery in at least a century: Martin Wolf is on vibrant form in the Financial Times today over the issue of Germany's chunky trade surplus. He explains in detail why he fears that Germany is sucking demand away from its allies, particularly in the euro area, through its buoyant exports. This issue roared up the agenda last week when the US Treasury took the rare step of identifying Germany's export success as a threat to world economic stability. Wolf writes: Surplus countries import the demand they do not generate internally. When global demand is buoyant, this need not be a problem provided the money borrowed by deficit countries is invested in activities that can subsequently service the debts they are incurring. Alas, this does not happen often, partly because the deficit countries are pushed by the supply of cheap imports from surplus countries towards investing in non-tradeable activities, which do not support the servicing of international debts. But in current conditions, when short-term official interest rates are close to zero and demand is chronically deficient across the globe, the import of demand by the surplus country is a \u201cbeggar-my-neighbour\u201d policy: it exacerbates this global economic weakness. Wolf then tries to blows down what he sees as another German fairytale, that the rest of the eurozone can learn from the Mittelstand and export their way to success: It will be impossible, however, for the eurozone to achieve prosperity on the basis of export-led growth: it is too large to do so. It has to achieve internal rebalancing, as well. Hitherto, as the IMF\u2019s October World Economic Outlook shows, it is mass shedding of labour that has raised competitiveness, and collapsing domestic demand that has reduced external deficits in the crisis-hit countries. Thus the adjustment successes have been the other side of the coin of economic slumps and soaring unemployment. Yet, even so, the IMF does not forecast significant reductions in net liability positions. Their vulnerability will endure. So what, in brief, is happening? The answers are: creeping onset of deflation; mass joblessness; thwarted internal rebalancing and over-reliance on external demand. The full piece is here (FT paywall permitting....): Germany is a weight on the world There's also a discussion on the issue in the reader comments below: BAE System's plan to cut almost 1,800 jobs across its UK sites has dampened the optimism generated by this morning's strong industrial output data. The impact of ending 500 years of shipbuilding in Portsmouth won't be seen in the data for a while. But it highlights that Britain's manufacturing sector remains stressed -- despite the 1.2% leap in manufacturing output in September (full story here). Economics editor Larry Elliott writes: Clearly, this is a dreadful blow to the communities concerned, but it is not representative of what is happening to the rest of manufacturing, where official data shows output rising strongly in the past two quarters. Helped by a strong performance by the car industry, manufacturing output was 0.9% higher in the three months to September than in the previous quarter. So if the BAE job losses are the result of specific issues facing shipbuilding and the rest of manufacturing is growing, doesn't that suggest that the UK can look forward to a broad-balanced recovery? Not really. Sure, there has been a pick-up in manufacturing output since the spring, but production was only 1% higher in September than a year earlier, and more than 8% below its level a decade ago. More here: The economy is growing but industry is further weakened \u2013 sound familiar? As we flagged up this morning, the lousy weather in Athens sank plans for a really big rally in the Greek capital. But thousands of workers did still march, to mark today's anti-austerity general strike. Here's Reuters latest report: Thousands of striking Greek workers marched to parliament in pouring rain on Wednesday to protest against measures imposed by foreign lenders, whose inspectors are in Athens to review the country's bailout. The 24-hour general walkout by Greece's largest public and private sector unions shut schools and disrupted flights but far fewer people took to the streets compared with previous protests as heavy downpours blanketed Athens. The \"troika\" of European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund inspectors resumed their latest bailout review on Tuesday. \"Enough is enough, we've lost our dignity.\" said Fotini Halikiopoulou, a 55-year old public sector employee. \"We've sacrificed everything and they (the troika) are not budging an inch.\"School teachers, doctors, municipal and transport workers were among the groups that joined the strike. Air traffic controllers stopped work from 1000 to 1300 GMT and journalists stopped work for five hours.But the bleak weather and despondency among Greeks inured to protests against the erosion of jobs and benefits meant the marches largely fizzled, with two unions cancelling plans for a coordinated march to parliament because of the rain. About 15,000 protesters, mainly from the Communist group PAME and leftist parties, rallied at central Syntagma square where police and demonstrators have clashed in the past.They held banners reading \"No more sacrifices\" and chanted \"Don't bow down!\" KEEP FIGHTING Labour unions fear Greece will have to impose further wage and pension cuts to meet its bailout targets in the coming years, union officials said. Greece and its lenders are at odds over the size of a projected budget hole next year. The unions are also protesting against planned public sector job cuts and privatisations. \"We'll keep fighting,\" said Stathis Anestis, general secretary of the private sector union GSEE. \"We warn the government that people will not tolerate any more austerity.\" Some interesting moves in the eurozone sovereign debt market today. The yield, or interest rate, on Portugal's 10-year bonds has dropped to a five-month low of 5.94%, as traders push up the price of the securities. And a sale of index-linked Italian bonds has seen extremely strong demand -- with traders bidding for more than \u20ac22bn of debt: Reuters reckoned last night that this could become the biggest sale of European government debt ever... Bloomberg is running an interesting piece today about four oil traders who are claiming in court that they can prove crude oil prices have been fixed. The case, filed last month, argues that the system used by Platt's to set the official prices is being gamed. Allegations of this nature have been swirling for a while, but this case offers plenty of detail: Here's a flavour: Over 85 pages, the plaintiffs describe how the market allegedly showed that the Brent spot price was artificially driven up or down by the defendants, depending on what would profit them most in swap, futures or spot markets. They allege the defendants used methods including \"spoofing\" \u2013 placing orders that move markets with the intention of cancelling them later. Platts's methodology \"can be easily gamed by market participants that make false, inaccurate or misleading trades\", the plaintiff traders alleged. More here: Oil traders claim crude prices fixed Our news story on the job losses across BAE Systems is here: BAE axes 1,800 jobs and shuts down shipbuilding in Portsmouth And here's Russia Today's video report from Athens: Photos from the communist union's march in Athens today are flooding in: It may feel like just another Greek strike, but the reality is that many people taking to the streets today have suffered badly for the country's long recession. A former finance ministry cleaner, Evangelia Alexaki, told AP she is now destitute, having lost her \u20ac500 per month job in the government's layoffs: They throw us to the streets, just like that. Women who are 57 and 58 years old, and (too young) to get pensions or anything else. For us, this money was little but at least we could fulfill some of the family's needs. Now they're sending us to poverty. Those lucky enough to be in work found they couldn't get to the office as transport links were closed for today's general strike: It's not just the UK posting stronger than expected industrial data -- Germany just hammered expectations with a 3.3% rise in manufacturing orders in September. Analysts had expected orders to rise by just 0.5%, after seeing them drop in August. Overseas demand, rather than orders between German firms, drove the increase. Foreign orders jumped by 6.8% month-on-month, while domestic orders fell by 1.0%. Orders for Capital Goods (big ticket machinery) from overseas were particularly strong - jumping by 10.2%, while domestic demand fell by 2.3%. The German finance ministry isn't getting carried away, saying that the impetus from abroad remained rather weak. And the more reliable two-month average of orders, covering August and September, rose by a less dramatic 0.4%. It may be wet in Greece, but protesters are still taking their anti-austerity message onto the streets as the general strike continues: One more point on the BAE Systems job cuts, it plans to cut 940 posts in Portsmouth in 2014(where the shipyard is shutting), and 835 across Filton, Glasgow and Rosyth by 2016. Keep watching Andy Sparrow for more.... It's official -- BAE Systems is proposing to cut 1,775 workers in the UK, and plans to shut its Portsmouth shipyard next year (as we flagged up last night). It's a big political story, so Andrew Sparrow is going to track it in his Politics Live blog here. Here's the news wire snaps: BAE SYSTEMS PLC - RE AGREEMENT BAE SYSTEMS PLC - RATIONALISATION OF THE UK NAVAL SHIP BUSINESS TO MATCH FUTURE CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS BAE SYSTEMS - REACHED AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH HM GOVERNMENT BAE SYSTEMS - ON MEASURES TO ENABLE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A RESTRUCTURING OF ITS UK NAVAL SHIPS BUSINESS. BAE SYSTEMS PLC - DEAL WILL MEAN RESTRUCTURING OF THE CONTRACT FOR QUEEN ELIZABETH CLASS AIRCRAFT CARRIER PROGRAMME.

Dozens of cleaners gathered outside the ministry as the officials drove up, shrieking in high-pitched voices that could be heard several city blocks away, to protest forced public-sector sackings the inspectors are demanding. Their protest triggered an unprecedented security alert at the ministry. After a meeting lasting more than two hours inside the building, the officials\u2013from the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, known as the troika\u2013snuck out of the ministry via an external fire escape, thereby avoiding the front entrance. Shortly before their escape, the troika\u2019s burly security guards could be seen inspecting the escape route to make sure it was clear of any disgruntled cleaners. Helena's story about the Troika's tricky first day in Athens is here: Greek protesters rally against IMF and EU inspection Incidentally, those cleaning workers have been spotted at today's soggy protests: And here's a tweet from a rally in Crete, where the weather looks less autumnal. Here's a photo confirming that the communist PAME union's marchers reached Syntagma Square in Athens, despite the rain dampening hopes of a mass rally (see 10.18am) Away from Athens, there are reports of hundreds of people taking part in the Greek city of Ioannina: Our correspondent in Greece, Helena Smith, reports that the main Greek public sector trade union has cancelled what they had hoped would be a mass rally in Athens to mark today's general strike, because of heavy rain. The General Strike, though, continues, with around two-thirds of union members taking part (according to ADEDY, anyway). Helena writes: I have just spoken to Odysseus Trivalas, president of the public sector workers' union, ADEDY, who says they have had to abandon today's rally after effectively being rained out. \"The general strike has of course happened with, we estimate a 65% response rate, but we have had to cancel the march to parliament because of the weather,\" he told me speaking from Pedio tou Areo, the park from where protest rallies traditionally start. \"Very few people have turned up so we have decided to call another general strike which will definitely take place before the end of the year. After all there is a lot to protest about. All these games that the troika and the government are playing with this hoo-ha over next year's budget hole is about preparing Greeks, psychologically, for another round of measures.\" As flagged up at 10.03 am, the communist PAME union still managed to march to Syntagma Square. Helena reports that \"the chants of workers affiliated to the communist aligned PAME union can be heard over Athens - ever prepared our battled hardened comrades turned up with umbrellas\". Regular reader Kizbot had already predicted that the weather could scupper the union's plans... Further evidence that the eurozone economy is faltering: retail sales fell by 0.6% month-on-month in September, and August's reading has been revised down to +0.5% from +0.7%. September's fall is bigger than expected (economists had pencilled in a 0.4% decline). Back to Greece, and groups of protesters are marching in Athens, despite the capital being struck by heavy rain. University lecturer Spyros Gkelis tweets some photos: This chart from the ONS shows how the auto industry is driving Britain's manufacturing recovery: Speaking of cars.... UK car sales were up 4.0% year-on-year in October, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. That's the 20th monthly rise in a row, but it's a slower rate than earlier this year. Some early reaction to the latest decent UK economic data: The pound has jumped on the news that UK industrial output beat forecasts in September -- up 0.6% against the US dollar to $1.6105. Traders are predicting that the Bank of England will raise interest rates rather earlier than its forecast date of 2016.... Better news in the UK -- Britain's industrial production grew faster than expected in September, driven by manufacturing sector. Output in the industrial sector rose by 0.9%, meaning it was 2.2% higher than a year ago. That's the strongest annual rate since January 2011. Manufacturing output was up by a healthy 1.2% during the month, led by firms making pharmaceutical products, transport equipment; and computing and electronic goods, according to the Office for National Statistics. It also reported that: Looking at the broader picture, production output was 2.2% higher in September 2013 compared with September 2012; reflecting an 11.5% rise in mining &amp; quarrying; 0.8% rise in manufacturing; 7.1% rise in water supply, sewerage &amp; waste management; and 3.4% fall in electricity, gas, steam &amp; air conditioning. So, it's not just house prices that are going up. However, output is still someway below its pre-crisis peak, as this graph show: Markit's survey, showing that growth in the eurozone private sector slowed last month, is online here. (see my previous post for more details) Their chief economist, Chris Williamson, says it shows the eurozone's weak recovery from recession isn't speeding up: The euro area economic recovery lost less momentum than first estimated in October. The final reading of the October Eurozone PMI came in above the flash estimate, but still fell compared with September to signal an easing in the already- modest pace of expansion. The survey signals a mere 0.2% quarterly growth rate at the start of the fourth quarter, unchanged on the third quarter. \u201cThe loss of momentum raises concerns that the upturn is faltering and piles further pressure on the European Central Bank to reinvigorate the recovery, especially as a drop in inflation to a near four-year low of 0.7% \u2013 well below the ECB\u2019s target rate of 2.0% \u2013 has raised concerns about deflation taking hold. \u201cThe case for renewed stimulus is by no means clear cut, however, as policymakers will note that the economy has shown a major turnaround so far this year. Having signalled a steep rate of contraction during the early months of 2013, the PMI has indicated growth in each of the past four months, and expansion is now being seen across the board in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Most impressive is the surging pace of growth seen in Ireland, where growth is the strongest since 2006. The eurozone's economic recovery lost some pace last month, according to Markit's closely watched survey of businesses across the region. Its Service Sector PMI, which measures activity of thousands of firms, dropped to 51.6 in October from 52.2 in September. Any reading above 50 shows growth, and this is actually better than the 'flash reading' two weeks ago (of 50.9). But still, the lower rise in activity is another worrying signal that the eurozone's economy is losing momentum, having struggled out of recession this summer. Add in the latest manufacturing data, and Markit's Composite PMI comes in at 51.9, down from 52.2 in September. As Chris Williamson, chief economist at PMI compiler Markit, put it: The loss of momentum raises concerns that the upturn is faltering and piles further pressure on the European Central Bank to reinvigorate the recovery. Germany and France's private sectors both posted steady growth, while Italian firms reported that activity was less strong than in September (although its PMI of 51.3 shows it still expanded). Last night, my colleagues Dan Milmo and Jennifer Rankin reported that BAE Systems was poised to cut jobs across its defence operations. Here: Thousand BAE jobs at risk in Portsmouth and Scotland We're now hearing that an announcement could come this morning, at 11am. While many Greeks go on strike today, academics at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) decided to return to work yesterday. They'd held a two-month walkout in protest on planned public sector cutbacks. More details here: Rift in university strike as NTUA professors return to work There's some cynicism, meanwhile, as to whether today's strikes will really do much good: Speaking of front pages, the Financial Times has splashed on a story we mentioned in the blog yesterday -- the Euribor rate-rigging scandal. Our friends over at Southwark Bridge reckon banks face billions of euros in new fines, over allegations that traders conspired to fix the official rate at which banks would lend to each other in euros. Here's a flavour: Brussels is poised to levy multibillion-euro fines on banks that took part in a cartel to rig two key global interest rate benchmarks as the cost of financial misconduct continues to spiral. Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale are set to pay the fines next month to settle allegations they acted in concert to manipulate either Euribor, Yen Libor or both benchmarks, according to people familiar with the talks. A further three banks \u2013 JPMorgan, HSBC and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole \u2013 have been involved in the talks but are currently holding out from signing a joint \u00c8uribor settlement, the people said. These banks are likely to face formal charges that would pave the way for fines at a later stage. In the UK, the average house now costs 6.9% more than a year ago, according to new data from Halifax. Prices rose by 0.7% in October, following a 0.4% rise in September, it reported. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight called it: a robust rise... which will maintain mounting concern over the pace at which house prices are increasing. Plenty of analysts are worried that \"Booming Britain\"* is experiencing the wrong sort of recovery. As Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale put it: The UK recovery continues to fill me with mixed emotions. On the plus side, it's a recovery. On the minus side, it's an old pre-crisis sort of a services, housing-led recovery that isn't exactly shared around properly. * -see the basement of today's Telegraph front page: Athens city centre is likely to be disrupted for several hours today, as the union protests get under way. PAME, the communist union, gets its rally underway in a few minutes at Omonia Square, with ADEDY and GSEE, the public and private sector trade unions, starting 30 minutes later. They'll converge at Syntagma Square, site of the Greek parliament. As usual on these occasions, the excellent Living In Greece website has full details of today's general strike. Here's a flavour: Archaeological sites and museums (state-run) will be closed due to ADEDY strike. *Privately run locations, such as the Acropolis Museum and Benaki Museum, are unaffected. Banks: OTOE union has encouraged employees to strike, but the majority of branches stay open without disruption because banks are in financial trouble. \u2014 Naftemporiki (in Greek) City halls, mayors\u2019 offices and local municipal services may be closed/disrupted due to POE-OTA union participation in strike. \u2014 POE-OTA Press Release (in Greek) Courthouses: Cases postponed due to strike by judicial employees. \u2014 Naftemporiki, Naftemporiki (in Greek) Hospitals (state-run) will take emergency cases only, if the location is affected. \u2014 Naftemporiki (in Greek) *Many locations continue working. Private hospitals unaffected. Journalists: POESY union calls on Greek journalists to strike from 10:00-15:00 and join main protest at 11:00. \u2014 POESY Press Release (in Greek) *However, there is rarely a news blackout as foreign press are unaffected and local reporters/publications opt to continue working. Greek schools are shut today, hospitals are running with fewer staff, and flights are being disrupted as the general strike gets underway. Here's Reuters early report: The 24-hour walkout by Greece's largest public and private sector unions brought much of the crisis-hit country to a standstill a day after officials from the \"troika\" of European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund resumed their latest bailout review. \"Workers, pensioners and the unemployed are going through an endless nightmare,\" port workers said in a statement.\"The government and the troika are destroying this country.\" Labour unions fear Greece will have to impose further wage and pension cuts to meet its bailout targets in the coming years, union officials said. Greece and its lenders are at odds over the size of a projected budget hole next year, which has spurred speculation of a new round of unpopular cuts. The unions are also protesting against planned public sector job cuts and privatisations. School teachers, doctors, municipal workers, train workers and bus drivers are among the groups that joined the strike. Air traffic controllers said they would stop working between 1000 and 1300 GMT, disrupting flights. Later in the day, thousands of people are expected to march to the central Syntagma square before parliament, where police and protesters have clashed in the past.\"United we can stop them, we can topple them,\" public sector union ADEDY said in a statement before the strike. Looking at UK airlines quickly -- Easyjet is warning that its morning flight from Manchester to Athens is delayed by over two hours, due to the air traffic control stoppage (although this may change, I guess...) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. Plenty of action today, starting with a general strike in Greece. Public and private unions have called a one-day walkout, to mark the return of Greece's international lenders to assess its unpopular bailout again. Protesters will hold an anti-austerity rally in the centre of Athens, and will march to the Parliament buildings to protest \u2013 once again \u2013 against Greece's programme of tax rises, spending cuts and job losses. Lots of economic data on the calendar too. New PMI surveys released shortly will show how the eurozone's service sector performed last month - timely, after the European Commission trimmed its growth forecasts for 2014 yesterday. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets flags up, the eurozone's strongest economy is expected to set the pace: It seems likely that we could well see a similarly divergent picture from the October services numbers today. German services PMI is expected to remain at 52.3, while the French numbers are likely to remain at 50.2. The worrying weakness that we saw in the preliminary Spanish numbers a couple of weeks ago look set to be reinforced with the end of the tourist season with a slide to 48.1, from 49, while the Italian numbers look set to weaken too, but not by as much, coming in at 51.7, from 52.7. There's also UK industrial production data at 9.30am, and eurozone retail sales at 10am. And in the corporate world, there's oodles of property-related news to dig into: Building firm Persimmon has reported that it has sold 3,000 homes under the UK government's Help to Buy scheme, while upmarket estate agent Foxton's has downplayed talk of a boom in London transactions this year -- blaming poor supply and limited mortgage availability (more on this to come). I'll be tracking all the main events through the day as usual.",

A proposed $500m share buyback will now stop, after $370m was repurchased.</p> <p>Last month Experian bought web fraud detection group 41st Parameter in its drive to expand internationally and into new product areas.</p> <p>Analyst Tony Shepard at Charles Stanley said:</p> <blockquote> The sudden burst of M&amp;A activity may have come as a surprise to most investors especially as Experian already has strong market positions in its markets and already has good underlying growth prospects. Normally, acquisitions are expected to provide double-digit after tax returns within 3-5 years though the latest two deals may be towards the end of this time horizon. Although the acquisition of Passport Health may enhance earnings per share on completion, the valuation remains full and we have downgraded the recommendation on Experian to hold (from accumulate). <br> </blockquote> <p>Jefferies also cut its rating on the company, with analyst Kean Marden saying:</p> <blockquote> The debate today will centre on value creation after another sizeable acquisition. Although the Passport Health Communication transaction should be earnings per share accretive, we believe [its] earnings before interest and tax need to increase from $30m to $80m to cover its cost of capital. With the shares now trading at our price target, we downgrade from buy to hold. <br> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 5.15 points lower at 6741.69 as recent data suggested a UK interest rate rise could come sooner than had been previously expected. Thursday sees both the latest meetings of both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank. In contrast to the UK, some analysts believe there is a chance the ECB could cut rates.</p> <p>On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 hit new heights after comments from US Federal Reserve officials reinforced the idea there was unlikely to be any easing of its $85bn a month bond buying programme before the end of the year.</p> <p><strong>Barclays</strong> rose 5.65p to 254.65p despite the bank's shares going ex-dividend, after a buy note from Investec. Analyst Ian Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> Contrary to populist perceptions, we see Barclays as notably less exposed on legal/regulatory issues than peers. <br> We do not seek to judge the relative \"guilt\" of banks in relation to Libor, foreign exchange etc. However, we believe that Barclays has been financially well served for its pro-active approach on Libor. On other issues, e.g. interest rate hedging products where Barclays has been more pro-active than peers in settling redress cases, we believe it may incur higher costs for taking an apparently more constructive approach. </blockquote> <p><strong>EasyJet</strong> climbed 11p to \u00a312.14 even though analysts at HSBC downgraded the budget airline's shares from neutral to underweight. The bank made the cut partly on the basis that competitors such as Ryanair would change their products and marketing to be more similar to way easyJet operates. HSBC said:</p> <blockquote> Near term, we think easyJet will see stronger revenue trends than peers this winter, but we see deteriorating revenue momentum; the stock is up 94% in the past 12 months. <br> Long term, we think competitor moves to adopt similar product and marketing to easyJet are unlikely to match the UK business's execution, but will reduce differentiation between the companies in the eyes of consumers.  We expect a large special dividend announcement at 2013 results but downgrade to underweight, with small cuts to our estimates; cut our target price to \u00a312.25 (versus \u00a313.70). </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Associated British Foods</strong> - the sugar to Primark business - recovered from its falls on Tuesday in the wake of results. It added 61p to \u00a322.69p after a number of brokers issued positive notes, including Morgan Stanley, UBS, Societe Generale and Citigroup.</p> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> rose 2.35p to 230.60p after two more brokers suggested the mobile phone group could be a target for US group AT&amp;T.</p> <p>At Berenberg, analyst Paul Marsch issued a hold note with a 233p price target, saying:</p> <blockquote> While rising political concerns over US eavesdropping may make European Commission approval of an AT&amp;T move more challenging, if AT&amp;T is serious about the European mobile opportunity, it is unlikely to be put off by such concerns. <br> A premium offer from AT&amp;T remains a possibility, even if a successful deal is no slam-dunk \u2013 the prospect of 265p-275p per share remains enticing. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Bernstein analysts raised their price target on Vodafone from 230p to 250p, factoring in a 75% chance of a deal with AT&amp;T. They said:</p> <blockquote> Operationally and strategically, both AT&amp;T and Vodafone are experiencing a rough patch. The possible mega merger between the two that could be a welcome distraction for both appears to have the same momentum as the Verizon/Vodafone deal earlier this year. </blockquote> <p><strong>Centrica</strong> dropped 4.8p to 353.2p but <strong>SSE</strong> edged up 1p to \u00a314.01 after UBS cut its price targets on the energy companies but kept its buy rating on SSE. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> We estimate the valuation impact of Labour's proposed tariff freeze is -13p on Centrica and -54p on SSE. We believe SSE is oversold compared to Centrica when valuing this and possible follow-on policies. Although not riskless, we believe SSE remains attractive relative to Centrica and EU peers, and in absolute terms. We reiterate our buy rating on SSE and our neutral call on Centrica. We now include in our forecasts the impact of a windfall tax on the carbon price floor benefit on old hydro and nuclear, to reflect this risk. Based on this and other updates, we trim our price target for SSE to 1,570p from 1,630p, and for Centrica to 355p from 370p. </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Moneysupermarket.com</strong> jumped 24.7p to 179.7p after an upbeat trading statement, with fourth quarter revenues boosted by consumers switching energy suppliers since mid-October after power price rises.</p> <p><strong>Centamin</strong>, owner of the Sukari gold mine in Egypt, closed 2.5p lower at 48.3p after reporting third quarter profits of $43m, down 36% and slightly lower than some expectations. The results were hit by falling bullion prices, but the mining group said it was on course to more than meet its full year production target.</p> <p><strong>Premier Foods</strong>, the company behind the Hovis, Mr Kipling, Bisto and Sharwoods brands, put on 4.5p to 144.50p after confirming it is seeking an investor for its bread business.

      "bodyText": "Experian led the FTSE 100 lower after the credit information business reported slightly lower than expected first half figures and unveiled an expensive looking acquisition. Its shares dropped 81p to \u00a311.82 as half year profits rose 2% to $573m, compared to Thomson Reuters' mean estimate of $589m. It is also paying $850m for US healthcare data firm Passport Health Communications, which helps 2,500 hospitals across the country manage payments between patients, insurers and government schemes. A proposed $500m share buyback will now stop, after $370m was repurchased. Last month Experian bought web fraud detection group 41st Parameter in its drive to expand internationally and into new product areas. Analyst Tony Shepard at Charles Stanley said: The sudden burst of M&amp;A activity may have come as a surprise to most investors especially as Experian already has strong market positions in its markets and already has good underlying growth prospects. Normally, acquisitions are expected to provide double-digit after tax returns within 3-5 years though the latest two deals may be towards the end of this time horizon. Although the acquisition of Passport Health may enhance earnings per share on completion, the valuation remains full and we have downgraded the recommendation on Experian to hold (from accumulate). Jefferies also cut its rating on the company, with analyst Kean Marden saying: The debate today will centre on value creation after another sizeable acquisition. Although the Passport Health Communication transaction should be earnings per share accretive, we believe [its] earnings before interest and tax need to increase from $30m to $80m to cover its cost of capital. With the shares now trading at our price target, we downgrade from buy to hold. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 5.15 points lower at 6741.69 as recent data suggested a UK interest rate rise could come sooner than had been previously expected. Thursday sees both the latest meetings of both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank. In contrast to the UK, some analysts believe there is a chance the ECB could cut rates. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 hit new heights after comments from US Federal Reserve officials reinforced the idea there was unlikely to be any easing of its $85bn a month bond buying programme before the end of the year. Barclays rose 5.65p to 254.65p despite the bank's shares going ex-dividend, after a buy note from Investec. Analyst Ian Gordon said: Contrary to populist perceptions, we see Barclays as notably less exposed on legal/regulatory issues than peers. We do not seek to judge the relative \"guilt\" of banks in relation to Libor, foreign exchange etc. However, we believe that Barclays has been financially well served for its pro-active approach on Libor. On other issues, e.g. interest rate hedging products where Barclays has been more pro-active than peers in settling redress cases, we believe it may incur higher costs for taking an apparently more constructive approach. EasyJet climbed 11p to \u00a312.14 even though analysts at HSBC downgraded the budget airline's shares from neutral to underweight. The bank made the cut partly on the basis that competitors such as Ryanair would change their products and marketing to be more similar to way easyJet operates. HSBC said: Near term, we think easyJet will see stronger revenue trends than peers this winter, but we see deteriorating revenue momentum; the stock is up 94% in the past 12 months. Long term, we think competitor moves to adopt similar product and marketing to easyJet are unlikely to match the UK business's execution, but will reduce differentiation between the companies in the eyes of consumers. We expect a large special dividend announcement at 2013 results but downgrade to underweight, with small cuts to our estimates; cut our target price to \u00a312.25 (versus \u00a313.70). Elsewhere Associated British Foods - the sugar to Primark business - recovered from its falls on Tuesday in the wake of results. It added 61p to \u00a322.69p after a number of brokers issued positive notes, including Morgan Stanley, UBS, Societe Generale and Citigroup. Vodafone rose 2.35p to 230.60p after two more brokers suggested the mobile phone group could be a target for US group AT&amp;T. At Berenberg, analyst Paul Marsch issued a hold note with a 233p price target, saying: While rising political concerns over US eavesdropping may make European Commission approval of an AT&amp;T move more challenging, if AT&amp;T is serious about the European mobile opportunity, it is unlikely to be put off by such concerns. A premium offer from AT&amp;T remains a possibility, even if a successful deal is no slam-dunk \u2013 the prospect of 265p-275p per share remains enticing. Meanwhile Bernstein analysts raised their price target on Vodafone from 230p to 250p, factoring in a 75% chance of a deal with AT&amp;T. They said: Operationally and strategically, both AT&amp;T and Vodafone are experiencing a rough patch. The possible mega merger between the two that could be a welcome distraction for both appears to have the same momentum as the Verizon/Vodafone deal earlier this year. Centrica dropped 4.8p to 353.2p but SSE edged up 1p to \u00a314.01 after UBS cut its price targets on the energy companies but kept its buy rating on SSE. The bank said: We estimate the valuation impact of Labour's proposed tariff freeze is -13p on Centrica and -54p on SSE. We believe SSE is oversold compared to Centrica when valuing this and possible follow-on policies. Although not riskless, we believe SSE remains attractive relative to Centrica and EU peers, and in absolute terms. We reiterate our buy rating on SSE and our neutral call on Centrica. We now include in our forecasts the impact of a windfall tax on the carbon price floor benefit on old hydro and nuclear, to reflect this risk. Based on this and other updates, we trim our price target for SSE to 1,570p from 1,630p, and for Centrica to 355p from 370p. Among the mid-caps Moneysupermarket.com jumped 24.7p to 179.7p after an upbeat trading statement, with fourth quarter revenues boosted by consumers switching energy suppliers since mid-October after power price rises. Centamin, owner of the Sukari gold mine in Egypt, closed 2.5p lower at 48.3p after reporting third quarter profits of $43m, down 36% and slightly lower than some expectations. The results were hit by falling bullion prices, but the mining group said it was on course to more than meet its full year production target. Premier Foods, the company behind the Hovis, Mr Kipling, Bisto and Sharwoods brands, put on 4.5p to 144.50p after confirming it is seeking an investor for its bread business. It said: [Premier] has appointed [financial advisory firm] Ondra Partners to assist in developing investment options for the bread business, which include co-investment by a partner. There can be no certainty that a transaction will follow at any point in the future, but the company will provide updates as appropriate. But analysts have mixed views, with some suggesting it would still need a rights issue of up to \u00a3300m to boost its balance sheet. UTV was steady at 220p after announcing it had applied for a licence for a new television station in the Republic of Ireland. David O'Brien at Shore Capital said: Following the signing of an agreement with ITV Studios Global, UTV will have exclusive broadcasting rights for ITV Studios content in the Republic, once a licence has been secured.

The chain, which has most of its 44 branches in London, said sales in the capital had been relatively flat in 2013 because of a shortage of homes for sale and low mortgage availability. Despite the fairly lifeless market, the estate agent reported that its turnover for July to September was 18% higher than last year, hitting \u00a341m, boosted by the seven new branches it opened in 2013. Revenues from property sales and lettings were up 29% and 8% respectively on last year, the company said in its first management statement since it floated on the London Stock Exchange, in September. Michael Brown, the chief executive, said the initial public offering had left the company in a strong position, with no debt. He said: \"We remain confident about Foxtons' prospects for the rest of the year but do not expect to see a significant upturn in London property sales transactions.\" These comments sent Foxtons shares falling 2.5%, down 8p at 308p, in early trading on Wednesday, although this remains a 34% premium on its float price. Foxtons, known for its hefty commissions and fleet of dark-green Mini Coopers, said it remained to be seen whether early signs of a pickup in mortgage activity and recent government initiatives, such as the Help to Buy mortgage-guarantee scheme, would translate into a significant increase in market volumes. However, \"these dynamics are expected to materialise slowly\", it said. Help to Buy, which allows borrowers to put down a 5% deposit on the asking price, applies only to properties up to \u00a3600,000, meaning its effect on Foxtons' pricey central London territory will be muted. The scheme was recently extended to all properties, after initially being targeted at new-build homes. The first phase of the scheme, offering subsidised mortgages for new homes, has helped one of the UK's biggest homebuilders, Persimmon, sell 3,000 homes. Persimmon said visitor levels were 20% up on last year, with cancellations running at historic lows. With two months to go before the end of the year it had sold all its houses for 2013, with reservations for next year and beyond up 41% on last year.",

The shipyard will close by the end of 2015, with heavy job losses there and in Scotland.</p> <p>The end of shipbuilding in Portsmouth brings the curtain down on a centuries old industry in a city that built the Tudor warship the Mary Rose.</p> <p>The defence giant announced on Wednesday morning that 940 shipbuilding jobs will be lost in Portsmouth. A further 835 jobs are to go, mostly in Glasgow, but also in Rosyth near Dunfermline and Filton near Bristol. The jobs of an additional 3,200 BAE staff employed in maintaining and servicing Royal Navy ships at the Portsmouth naval base are not affected, although business leaders voiced fears about the knock-on effects for businesses supplying the dockyards. Union leaders described the plans to cut 1,775 jobs \u2013 far more than previously expected \u2013 as \"a huge blow to Britain's manufacturing and industrial base\".</p> <p>The long-awaited announcement comes after BAE Systems experienced the biggest peak in UK shipbuilding since the second world war, but now faces a shortfall of work with too many staff for its next big order, the Type 26 frigates that will replace the current generation of combat ships. BAE, the UK's largest defence contractor, said Glasgow was the best location for building the Type 26 \u2013 a decision that has angered Portsmouth, while the government has been accused of preserving the Glasgow shipyards at the English city's expense to avoid damaging the pro-union campaign ahead of a vote on Scottish independence in 2014.</p> <p>Speaking at prime minister's questions, David Cameron said the decision had been extremely difficult. \"In Portsmouth, yes there will be job reductions, but there are many more people involved in ship servicing than in ship building.\"</p> <p>\"No one should be in any doubt of two things: under this government we will have aircraft carriers, Type 45 destroyers, the new frigates, the hunter-killer submarines.\"</p> <p>In a separate appearance before MPs, the defence secretary Philip Hammond unveiled a contract for the government to buy three offshore patrol vessels, all-purpose oceangoing ships that will be used to tackle terrorism and piracy. These will ensure the shipyards do not stand idle before the building of larger Type 26 frigates gets underway in 2016.</p> <p>Hammond said: \"This is an investment not only in three ships but in this country's warship building industry. It prevents workers standing idle and sustains the vital skills needed to build the planned Type 26 frigate in the future.\"</p> <p>This would be a cheaper option for the government than letting the shipyard stands idle, he added. Under a 2009 deal with BAE the government would have to pay a minimum of \u00a3230m a year in shipbuilding and support work.</p> <p>Hammond also announced that the government would spend more than \u00a3100m on expanding the dockyard at Portsmouth to make it ready for Type 45 destroyers, a new breed of large warships that will be based in the city.</p> <p>Union leaders, who are set to meet BAE executives early next week, have vowed to fight job cuts in England and Scotland.

      "bodyText": "BAE Systems is cutting almost 1,800 jobs as it calls an end to more than 500 years of shipbuilding in Portsmouth. The shipyard will close by the end of 2015, with heavy job losses there and in Scotland. The end of shipbuilding in Portsmouth brings the curtain down on a centuries old industry in a city that built the Tudor warship the Mary Rose. The defence giant announced on Wednesday morning that 940 shipbuilding jobs will be lost in Portsmouth. A further 835 jobs are to go, mostly in Glasgow, but also in Rosyth near Dunfermline and Filton near Bristol. The jobs of an additional 3,200 BAE staff employed in maintaining and servicing Royal Navy ships at the Portsmouth naval base are not affected, although business leaders voiced fears about the knock-on effects for businesses supplying the dockyards. Union leaders described the plans to cut 1,775 jobs \u2013 far more than previously expected \u2013 as \"a huge blow to Britain's manufacturing and industrial base\". The long-awaited announcement comes after BAE Systems experienced the biggest peak in UK shipbuilding since the second world war, but now faces a shortfall of work with too many staff for its next big order, the Type 26 frigates that will replace the current generation of combat ships. BAE, the UK's largest defence contractor, said Glasgow was the best location for building the Type 26 \u2013 a decision that has angered Portsmouth, while the government has been accused of preserving the Glasgow shipyards at the English city's expense to avoid damaging the pro-union campaign ahead of a vote on Scottish independence in 2014. Speaking at prime minister's questions, David Cameron said the decision had been extremely difficult. \"In Portsmouth, yes there will be job reductions, but there are many more people involved in ship servicing than in ship building.\" \"No one should be in any doubt of two things: under this government we will have aircraft carriers, Type 45 destroyers, the new frigates, the hunter-killer submarines.\" In a separate appearance before MPs, the defence secretary Philip Hammond unveiled a contract for the government to buy three offshore patrol vessels, all-purpose oceangoing ships that will be used to tackle terrorism and piracy. These will ensure the shipyards do not stand idle before the building of larger Type 26 frigates gets underway in 2016. Hammond said: \"This is an investment not only in three ships but in this country's warship building industry. It prevents workers standing idle and sustains the vital skills needed to build the planned Type 26 frigate in the future.\" This would be a cheaper option for the government than letting the shipyard stands idle, he added. Under a 2009 deal with BAE the government would have to pay a minimum of \u00a3230m a year in shipbuilding and support work. Hammond also announced that the government would spend more than \u00a3100m on expanding the dockyard at Portsmouth to make it ready for Type 45 destroyers, a new breed of large warships that will be based in the city. Union leaders, who are set to meet BAE executives early next week, have vowed to fight job cuts in England and Scotland. The announcement was \"a huge blow to Britain's manufacturing and industrial base\", said Ian Waddell of Unite. \"We will have to examine the BAE business case in detail to see how we can secure a future for the workforces at both Portsmouth and in Scotland. We believe that, if this is approached in a constructive and innovative way, it can be achieved.\" Waddell blamed Margaret Thatcher's government for \"sowing the seeds\" of current woes by closing shipyards in the 1980s, \"rather than funding investment that would have allowed Britain to compete in the global marketplace for shipbuilding orders against the likes of South Korea\". Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the Prospect union for defence specialists, argued that the UK must preserve its shipbuilding industry not only as \"a key element of our defence infrastructure\" but because \"it is also an industry where the UK should be a world-leader\". He added: \"Job losses of this scale will have a devastating impact upon local communities and economies. These are the very type of highly skilled jobs which should be leading us out of recession and helping create growth in the economy.\" Hugh Scullion, general secretary of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said he still hoped to avoid compulsory redundancies. Political flashpoint BAE's decision came as a huge blow to Portsmouth, which has been a UK naval base since Tudor times. Local politicians suspect political considerations ahead of the Scottish referendum next year put it in the firing line and accused Westminster of putting UK security at risk by choosing Scotland, when the break-up of the UK remains possible. \"I condemn the decision to shut down the last remaining shipyard in England with the capability to build advanced surface warships,\" said Gerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of Portsmouth City Council. \"This decision is bad for Portsmouth, with the loss of many highly-skilled jobs, but it's also bad for the defence of the UK and for the Royal Navy.\" \"The remaining yards with the capability to build advanced warships are in Scotland, and the referendum on Scottish independence is less than one year away. Ministers have put the defence of the UK and the future of the navy at real risk.\" \"We will work as hard as we can to protect jobs in Portsmouth. Portsmouth remains the home of the Royal Navy, with more than 10,000 jobs remaining in the dockyard.\" Maureen Frost of Hampshire Chamber of Commerce described the loss of the shipbuilding site as \"devastating news\" for Portsmouth that would have a major impact on the small businesses that supply BAE Systems. Closing one of the Scottish yards would have become a political flashpoint ahead of next year's referendum, with pro-union campaigners warning that closing the shipyards could hand victory to Alex Salmond's nationalist campaign. The announcement was brought forward after details leaked on Tuesday, but the future of the three yards has been under threat since BAE launched a review of its maritime operations last year. The decision comes after it emerged on Monday that the Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier programme will now cost \u00a36.2 bn, almost double the original estimates of the Labour government in 2007. The first of the carriers, the Queen Elizabeth, is due to begin sea trials towards the end of the decade.

      "standfirst": "Analysts split on outlook for struggling food group as it attempts to restructure", 
      "body": "<p><strong>Premier Foods</strong>, the company behind the Hovis, Mr Kipling, Bisto and Sharwoods brands, has confirmed it is seeking an investor for its bread business.</p> <p>The debt-laden group has already restructured the division, closing three bakeries and two mills after losing a number of own-label contracts. Last month the company, which is still struggling with borrowings of more than \u00a3850m, reported a slowdown in third quarter sales which it blamed on Britain's hot summer.</p> <p>Now, after earlier speculation about the future of the bread business, the company has said:</p> <blockquote> [Premier] confirms it has appointed [financial advisory firm] Ondra Partners to assist in developing investment options for the bread business, which include co-investment by a partner. There can be no certainty that a transaction will follow at any point in the future, but the company will provide updates as appropriate. </blockquote> <p>Reports had suggested the company could seek a private equity company to take a stake in the business, or set it up as a separate company owned by Premier and a new investor.</p> <p>The news has sent Premier's shares 5.25p higher to 145.25p, but analysts have mixed views, with some suggesting it will still need a rights issue to boost its balance sheet.

      "bodyText": "Premier Foods, the company behind the Hovis, Mr Kipling, Bisto and Sharwoods brands, has confirmed it is seeking an investor for its bread business. The debt-laden group has already restructured the division, closing three bakeries and two mills after losing a number of own-label contracts. Last month the company, which is still struggling with borrowings of more than \u00a3850m, reported a slowdown in third quarter sales which it blamed on Britain's hot summer. Now, after earlier speculation about the future of the bread business, the company has said: [Premier] confirms it has appointed [financial advisory firm] Ondra Partners to assist in developing investment options for the bread business, which include co-investment by a partner. There can be no certainty that a transaction will follow at any point in the future, but the company will provide updates as appropriate. Reports had suggested the company could seek a private equity company to take a stake in the business, or set it up as a separate company owned by Premier and a new investor. The news has sent Premier's shares 5.25p higher to 145.25p, but analysts have mixed views, with some suggesting it will still need a rights issue to boost its balance sheet. On the positive side is Darren Shirley of Shore Capital, who said: We see today's announcement as another potential positive development for Premier, which may lead to either investment in the infrastructure behind Hovis, which could support the plans to return the division to a more robust and sustained margin and cash flow position, or lead to potential disposal activity which may further deleverage the group's still constrained balance sheet position, whilst not materially impacting the existing cash generation of the business.
