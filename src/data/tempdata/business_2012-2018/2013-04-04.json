      "bodyText": "In a good week for reports on bad banks, give thanks for the banking standards commission's devastating account of the failure of HBOS. Whereas City lawyer Anthony Salz offered some worthy but not terribly surprising observations about Barclays' cultural shortcomings, the commissioners put responsibility for the HBOS debacle where it rightly belongs \u2013 in the boardroom. \"Primary responsibility for these failures should lie with the former chairman of HBOS, Lord Stevenson, and its former chief executives, Sir James Crosby and Andy Hornby,\" concludes the report. Well said \u2013 and it's about time somebody said it. It is astonishing that, almost half a decade after the implosion of HBOS, a parliamentary commission with a roving brief has provided the first official account of what went wrong. Royal Bank of Scotland will always hold top spot in British banking's hall of shame by virtue of its sheer size and the ludicrous top-of-the-market purchase of ABN Amro, but HBOS stands alone \"as a homegrown failure in traditional banking\", as the report puts it. The downfall of the bank deserved proper scrutiny long before now. Three features of the report stand out. First, the commissioners have killed stone dead the notion that HBOS was, in some vague sense, an innocent victim of the hurricane in financial markets around the time of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Stevenson, in particular, has tried to promote the idea that it was solely the closure of wholesale funding markets that did for HBOS. His argument is delusional. Between 2008 and 2011, after rescue by Lloyds and the state, HBOS's loan impairments were equivalent to 10.5% of the 2008 customer loan book. That's twice as high as at RBS. Without rescue, HBOS would have gone bust: its shareholders' funds at the end of 2011 of \u00a323bn were less than the capital of \u00a328bn injected by the Treasury and Lloyds. What's more, huge losses were experienced almost everywhere apart from the UK mortgage book. Contrary to popular belief, HBOS was not felled only by over-aggressive lending in the UK corporate division, where losses of \u00a325bn were clocked up. It also had impairments of \u00a315bn in the international business (principally Ireland and Australia) and a further \u00a37bn in the central treasury operation, estimate the commissioners. There was a \"systemic management failure across the organisation\", they say. The second stand-out conclusion follows from that. Why has the Financial Services Authority not even bothered to ask whether Stevenson, Crosby and Hornby should be barred from working in the financial sector? Of course none of the trio has tried to offer his services to another bank, but surely that's irrelevant. Just allowing \"approved person\" status to lapse is a cop-out on the part of the FSA. Regulators should hold boards to account and establish deterrents before the next crisis. Indeed, as the report does not say, it is baffling that Crosby retains a knighthood for services to the financial industry while Fred Goodwin does not. Rightly or wrongly, the government chose to get into the de-gonging game; it should be consistent in its judgments. The third main point is that the FSA's failures were not confined to its limp post-crash treatment of Stevenson, Crosby and Hornby, or even to the arbitrary fine and ban for Peter Cummings, head of the corporate division. Disgracefully, the regulator failed even to act on its own warnings. The title of the commissioners' report \u2013 An Accident Waiting to Happen \u2013 is taken from a 2004 comment by the FSA, which had correctly identified that HBOS was better at making loans than controlling risks. But the HBOS caravan was allowed to roll on, even as the bank's funding gap \u2013 the difference between the size of the deposit base and the loan book \u2013 exploded. The FSA concentrated on ticking boxes and missed the rotten nature of some of the assets. An FSA post-mortem on HBOS is also long overdue. Get on with it. In the meantime, be grateful that the parliamentary standards commission spent so much time on HBOS. Critics saw something akin to a show trial when Stevenson, Crosby and Hornby squirmed under cross-examination. In fact, the exercise was hugely enlightening as the main actors gave public testimony and were obliged to concede that much of the lending was incompetent. We also heard the most memorable line of the entire banking catastrophe. That came from Sir Ronald Garrick, former deputy chairman of HBOS: \"I have no doubt that the HBOS board was by far and away the best board I ever sat on.\" No, he wasn't joking.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Cyprus's crisis-hit economy could shrink by 13% in 2013, a government official warned on Thursday, as the head of the European Central Bank insisted the chaotic rescue of the troubled island was not a model for future bailouts. \"In 2013 the recession may not be 8.7% as is estimated, it may reach 13%,\" Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides said on state-run TV. The stark economic warning from the island, after a two-week bank closure that pitched the eurozone back into crisis, comes as the ECB announced on Thursday that it was leaving interest rates on hold. Cyprus finalised the terms of a \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.4bn) bailout this week with the troika of creditors, the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The island nation secured a financial lifeline last month to avert financial collapse, at the price of imposing losses on depositors with holdings above \u20ac100,000 at Cyprus's two largest banks, the Bank of Cyprus and Laiki. Cyprus is determined to stay in the euro after its painful rescue \u2013 \"leaving would be like jumping into the abyss\" Styliandes said. Speaking in Frankfurt, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, insisted that Cyprus's bailout was \"no template\" for other potential bailouts, words intended to calm investors who fear that bank depositors are now a target. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who also chairs the eurogroup, sparked panic selling on European stock markets last month, when he said a bailout levy on depositors, possibly including savers with assets under \u20ac100,000, could be a model for future bank bailouts. EU rules guarantee the savings of small depositors, and Draghi insisted on Thursday this should remain the case. \"You do not touch uninsured depositors,\" he said, adding that Dijsselbloem's words had been misunderstood. The ECB president also laid into Cypriot officials for the botched plan to bring small savers into the bailout. \"That was not smart, to say the least, and it was quickly corrected the day after in the eurogroup conference.\" Draghi said there was \"consensus\" among the bank's 23-strong governing council to leave interest rates on hold at 0.75%, a decision thrown into stark relief as the Japanese central bank embarked on an aggressive programme of monetary stimulus. The Italian central bank president insisted \"we stand ready to act\" if the economy continues to decline. Bank watchers saw these smoke signals as signalling an imminent rate cut, and German, Austrian and French bond yields slid in fear of a rate cut. Although the decision to hold rates was largely expected, markets gave the decision a cool response and the euro fell to a four-and-a-half month low against the dollar, but later rallied to a 0.2% rise on the day. Draghi predicted \"a gradual recovery\" in the second part of the year, although the eurozone is being blitzed by gloomy economic data. Manufacturing and services output in the 17-country currency club fell by more than expected in March, suggesting the eurozone suffered a sixth successive quarter of GDP contraction in the first quarter of 2013, according to analysts. Howard Archer, chief European &amp; UK economist at IHS Global Insight, predicted that further disappointing news would push the ECB to cut interest rates in May. \"Not only does further eurozone GDP contraction now seem highly probable in the first quarter, but prospects for the second quarter are looking increasingly worrying. With Eurozone consumer price inflation down at a 31-month low of 1.7% in March, wage growth generally weak and most inflationary measures currently muted, the ECB has ample scope to cut interest rates.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The president of the World Bank has warned that ending the worst of global poverty within a generation would prove a tougher challenge than tackling Aids, as he urged direct action to help more than a billion people benefit from growth. Jim Yong Kim, the former health activist chosen by Barack Obama to lead the Washington-based institution, said the goal of reducing the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day from 21% to 3% by 2030 was achievable but \"extraordinarily difficult\". Interviewed by the Guardian after a keynote speech this week in which he made poverty reduction and shared prosperity the focus of his five-year presidency, Kim said that rapid growth in China had been the most important factor in lifting people above the global breadline in recent years. \"Most of the low-hanging fruit has been picked,\" Kim said, following suggestions that the World Bank had set itself too easy a target. The proportion of people living in extreme poverty would fall to 6% if the recent trend continued, but Kim, who spearheaded a global campaign to provide blanket treatment for Aids, said this was not realistic. He added: \"This is the hardest goal I have ever tackled, harder than Aids. The curve is going to flatten out.\" Kim said the target would only be met if there was progress in India, sub-Saharan Africa and states torn apart by conflict. \"I hope those who say it is going to be easy are right. But everything I have seen tells me that it is not going to be easy.\" Kim, who was once part of the campaign urging the abolition of the World Bank, said the fact that 1.2 billion people were on less than $1.25 a day was \"a stain on our conscience\", and said he wanted to restore the anti-poverty focus the institution had under the presidency of Jim Wolfensohn, who ended his term in 2005. Reducing poverty, Kim added, was impossible without growth, and 90% of new jobs would be created by thriving private sectors. But he said growth on its own was not enough, and governments needed to adopt policies that made growth more inclusive. \"The evidence is overwhelming that if you pursue gross domestic product without inclusion you are building instability into your system. Growth has to be inclusive and there is much evidence to support that view.\" Identifying the need for governments to tailor policies to help young people, women and minorities, Kim said greater investment in health, education and conditional cash transfers \u2013 welfare payments that can only be spent on specific services such as medical check-ups \u2013 would help the poorest 40% of populations to share in growth. It made sense for health to be free at the point of use in poor countries unless it could be shown that payments were needed to prevent services being over-used. Kim said there was no contradiction between growth and a \"clean, sustainable future\" and said urgent action was needed to tackle climate change. Expressing alarm that global temperature could increase by four degrees centigrade by 2060, Kim said he had one question for the leaders of the environmental movement: \"Where's the plan?\" He added that when he was an Aids activist it had taken 22 years from 1981 to 2003 for the campaign to deliver an effective solution to the problem. Asked if there was a similar plan to tackle global warming, Kim replied: \"Not yet. There isn't one.\" The World Bank and the United Nations, Kim said, needed to come up with a bold and workable plan. \"We need to present it to the population and say there are going to be trade-offs and life is going to change a bit, but how much do you love your kids. The scientific evidence on climate change is overwhelming, and if you believe the science it is about family values. It's not about your great grandchildren, it's about your children.\"",

Indeed, it is very possible that the ECB could trim interest rates to 0.50% as soon as its May policy meeting.</p> <p>Significantly, ECB President Mario Draghi revealed that there had been \u201cextensive\u201d discussion on interest rates. Furthermore, he reported that the decision to keep interest rates at 0.75% was by consensus, so not unanimous.</p> <p>We suspect that likely ongoing disappointing Eurozone economic news will continue to push the ECB towards cutting interest rates, and likely sooner rather than later. We expect a cut from 0.75% to 0.50% in the second quarter, and consider a move as soon as May as highly possible.</p> <p>Not only does further Eurozone GDP contraction now seem highly probable in the first quarter, but prospects for the second quarter are looking increasingly worrying. With Eurozone consumer price inflation down at a 31-month low of 1.7% in March, wage growth generally weak and most inflationary measures currently muted, the ECB has ample scope to cut interest rates.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-04-04T15:24:50.771Z\">at 4.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-515d853195cb07e434cf0c18\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-04-04T13:50:41.651Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Draghi: Cyprus bailout is not a template for other rescues</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Draghi stressed that the Cyprus bailout, which involved losses imposed on richer bank depositors, was not a template for future rescues.</p> <p>\"Cyprus is no template.

      "bodyText": "Shares across Europe ended the day down sharply after the ECB failed to unleash any fresh economic stimulus. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 closed 1.1% lower at 1,180.65 points. The FTSE 100 closed down 76.16 points, or 1.2%, to 6,344.12 points - the lowest finish since 4 March. Germany's Dax closed down 0.7%, France's Cac is down 0.47%. And with that we'll wrap up the blog, and see you again tomorrow. Over in the US, American unemployment claims have hit a four-month high - up 28,000 to 385,000 - the Labor Department said. It was the third straight week of gains in claims and confounded economists' expectations for a drop to 350,000. Coming on the heels of data on Wednesday showing private employers added the fewest jobs in five months in March, the report implied some weakening in job growth after hiring accelerated in February. The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of labor market trends, rose 11,250 to 354,250. More details here. German bond yields have dropped to an 8-month low following Draghi's dovish comments that suggest a ECB rate cut is likely soon. The German 10-year yields fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.24% the lowest since August. French and Austrian 10-year yields fell to records as Draghi said monetary policy will \u201cremain accommodative for as long as needed\u201d to boost growth. Spanish and Italian bonds pared gains as the ECB president said the central bank won\u2019t immediately implement measures to ease funding strains for smaller companies. FX watch. The euro has now risen to a session high against the dollar, reversing a previous slide to a four-and-a-half month low. The Euro was trading at $1.2880 just after 3pm, a 0.2% rise on the day. The euro and the dollar have both risen by more than 3% against the yen, following the Bank of Japan's announcement of massive monetary easing. The dollar reached a session peak of 95.91 yen, a 3.1% rise over the day. The euro rose 3.2% to 123.36 yen, having hit as high as 123.47 yen. It is currently the biggest one day euro-yen rise since March 2011. Howard Archer, Chief European &amp; UK Economist at IHS Global Insight, reckons Draghi's dovish comments suggest an interest rate cut is looking even more probable and is likely to be sooner rather than later. While the ECB made no policy changes at its April meeting, the overall tone of its statement and Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments were markedly more dovish and an interest rate cut from 0.75% to 0.50% now looks highly likely. Indeed, it is very possible that the ECB could trim interest rates to 0.50% as soon as its May policy meeting. Significantly, ECB President Mario Draghi revealed that there had been \u201cextensive\u201d discussion on interest rates. Furthermore, he reported that the decision to keep interest rates at 0.75% was by consensus, so not unanimous. We suspect that likely ongoing disappointing Eurozone economic news will continue to push the ECB towards cutting interest rates, and likely sooner rather than later. We expect a cut from 0.75% to 0.50% in the second quarter, and consider a move as soon as May as highly possible. Not only does further Eurozone GDP contraction now seem highly probable in the first quarter, but prospects for the second quarter are looking increasingly worrying. With Eurozone consumer price inflation down at a 31-month low of 1.7% in March, wage growth generally weak and most inflationary measures currently muted, the ECB has ample scope to cut interest rates. Draghi stressed that the Cyprus bailout, which involved losses imposed on richer bank depositors, was not a template for future rescues. \"Cyprus is no template. I am absolutely sure that the chairman of the eurogroup has been misunderstood [he had previously been interrupted as having suggested that]. The press conference has finished. While we're talking Cyprus look at the range of forecasts on how long it will take for the Island's economy to recover Draghi says Cyprus leaving the Eurozone won't make any difference to its economy. What was wrong with Cyprus' economy doesn't stop if they are outside of the Euro. And he added that there are big risks attached to leaving the single currency. The Euro is falling fast. It's now dropped to a four-month low against the dollar on Draghi's dovish comments. Draghi says Cyprus officials were \"not smart\" in proposing a levy on ordinary savers with less than \u20ac100,000 in Cypriot banks. The ECB had presented a proposal where no levy on insured depositors was foreseen. And let me also tell you this was almost exactly the same as all of the other proposals by the (European) Commission, the IMF - the exactly the same picture. Then we started a prolonged negotiation with the Cyprus... with the parties present at the meeting, the outcome of which was what you saw - namely a levy on uninsured depositors.That was not smart, to say the least, and it was quickly corrected the day after in the Eurogroup conference. The ECB have released the full text of Draghi's statement. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. HICP inflation rates have declined further, as anticipated, and price developments over the medium term should remain contained. Monetary and loan dynamics remain subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At the same time, weak economic activity has extended into the early part of the year and a gradual recovery is projected for the second half of this year, subject to downside risks. You can read the whole thing here. Draghi's lack of optimism is not going down to well with FX traders. Draghi says the Eurozone should start to recover in the second-half of the year, subject to \"downside risks\". European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is about to start his press conference. You can watch it live here. (There's some lovely hold music...) The ECB has left the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.75%, as expected. Sterling has risen slightly from $1.5054 to $1.5066 on the bank of the Bank's decision to leave rates unchanged. The Bank made no statement on the MPC's decision to hold rates. The Bank of England has left interest rate unchanged at 0.5% and QE unchanged at \u00a3375bn. And over to Greece where our correspondent Helena Smith says the debt-stricken country\u2019s privatisation drive has been energized by news of the sale of four diplomatic missions abroad - including the counsul's official residence in Holland Park for \u00a323.3m She writes: The quest to reduce Greece\u2019s monumental debt mountain received a much-needed boost this morning with the announcement that four high-end properties, including the London home of the Greek consul, had fetched far more under the hammer than initially expected. In a surprise announcement, the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (TAIPED) overseeing the country\u2019s privatization drive, said the diplomatic missions had raised 41.1 million euro \u2013 27.7 higher than the initial valuation of the properties. The consul\u2019s home, a 10,000 ft double-fronted Victorian townhouse in London\u2019s fashionable Holland Park district sold for 23.3 million pounds (27.462 eur0). When Greek authorities announced the sale in September, under international pressure to reign in revenues, UK real estate agents had valued the residence at 20 million pounds. TAIPED said other sales included diplomatic buildings in Nicosia, Brussels and Belgrade with respective price tags of 8.3 million euro, 3.24 million euro and 2.075 million. Officials said the proceeds would be handed over to the country\u2019s creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF. \u201cAfter all the delays in our privatisation programme this has to be good news,\u201d one insider said. Savills, which sold the Grade II-listed property 9 bedroom town house, described it as: \"An incredible opportunity to modernise a wonderful Grade II listed detached Italianate Villa on the most desirable southern leg of the street. The property benefits from a 136' x 49' garden backing directly onto the park.\" Click here for a pdf of the brochure. It's nice, but the garden looks like could do with some work. More details from Unmodernised To all you millionaires out there, this is one for those of you with tens of millions* at your disposal, rather than the mere several million that you may have been thinking would suffice. Certainly at the business end of the unmodernised property market, this \u2018Grade II listed detached Italianate Villa\u2019 is certainly spot-on in terms of location. The next thing to worry about is the works involved to convert the property from it\u2019s former use as an annexe to the Greek Embassy. We reckon you\u2019d probably be looking at around \u00a3600 per square foot on all your refurb costs (yes, that\u2019s a renovation budget of +/- \u00a35.25m). It\u2019s endowed with a superb garden, and there\u2019s probably potential to extend beyond the current 8700 sq ft. Over in Italy the centre-left Mayor of Florence Matteo Renzi has called for a government coalition with former premier Silvio Berlusconi or new elections in June. It is a clear challenge to Italian center-left leader Pier Luigi Bersani. More from Reuters Bersani won a majority in the lower house but not the Senate in February elections, leaving his center-left group unable to govern alone. He failed last week in efforts to forge a viable majority in parliament after his overtures to the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement were rebuffed. Renzi, 38, who lost to Bersani last December in a vote to be the center-left election candidate, gave interviews to several Italian newspapers saying he was ready to be a candidate in new leadership primaries. Renzi had previously hesitated to challenge Bersani, a former communist politician who threw away a 10-point opinion poll lead in the February 24-25 election which left Italy in political deadlock. But in recent days he has become increasingly outspoken in attacking Bersani's line that a \"grand coalition\" alliance with scandal-plagued center-right leader Berlusconi is unthinkable. And Gazzetta del Sud \"We are going through a political-institutional period in which time is being wasted, while the world is asking us to run twice as fast\" said Renzi, who is expected to challenge to lead the centre left if Italy returns to the polls later this year after losing the last primary to the head of his Democratic Party (PD), Pier Luigi Bersani. Italian President Giorgio Napolitano at the weekend asked a group of 10 'wise men' to try to break the stalemate by producing a government programme capable of winning cross-party support. France posted a dire set of services PMIs for March today, coming in at 41.3 and further underlining the country's economic divergence from Germany. Nonetheless, France sold nearly \u20ac7bn worth of sovereign debt this morning - at the upper echelons of expectations. According to Adam Parry at International Financing Review: Once again, the French primary dealers did their usual efficient job of placing auction paper with domestic accounts, ensuring a solid set of results despite those awful PMI numbers. The Bank of Japan announcement has not shifted the dial for western investors, and neither has the successful Spanish bond auction. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up slightly - slightly - at 1,193 points and France's CAC index is up 0.75% with Spain's Ibex the best performer, up 1.4%. The FTSE is down slightly and it is safe to say that excitement over the imminent Bank of England and European Central Bank statements is not building. The early indications are that the Bank of Japan's announcement of a massive increase in quantitative easing has had the desired effect of pushing down the yen against the dollar. The phrase ch\u014d endaka - or \"super-strong yen\" - is a common refrain among Japanese manufacturers who have been forced to base their operations abroad in a bid to stay competitive. The dollar rose more than 2.5% to 95.69 yen this morning and analysts expect it to rise further against the Japanese currency. Lee Hardman, currency economist at BTMU, said: The BoJ has set in play a very aggressive expansion of monetary policy and it's very likely dollar/yen will continue to rise. Here's Heather Stewart's take on the UK services PMI data for March, which could strengthen the arm of hawks on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, who fear that further quantitative easing could stoke inflation. Nicholas Spiro at Spiro Sovereign Strategy argues that Spain's \"remarkable\" performance in the bond markets indicates that investors are no longer concerned about the threat to the eurozone's fourth largest economy. Spanish debt, and Italian paper for that matter, continues to confound the sceptics. One can no longer attribute the resilience of Spain's debt market to the ECB's bond-buying programme alone, whose credibility and effectiveness are increasingly in doubt. For the time being, investors are simply no longer sufficiently concerned about Spain to force a sharp and sustained sell-off. The result of this morning's auction, with the Treasury getting all its debt out the door (and then some) and a further dip in yields, underscores markets' muted reaction to the harsh treatment meted out to private creditors in Cyprus. Reuters is reporting that Spain sold more sovereign debt than it expected at a bond auction today, getting away \u20ac4.3bn of bonds compared with the anticipated \u20ac3bn to \u20ac4bn. The yields - or interest rate payments - were at similar levels to recent auctions. There is less optimism, however, about the eurozone's performance in the first quarter of the year. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight says the contraction in eurozone services in March indicates that the area suffered a sixth successive quarter of GDP contraction in the first quarter of 2013. This is bad news for UK exports, and therefore the British economy as a whole. Looking ahead to the European Central Bank interest rate announcement this afternoon, Archer adds: Despite mounting signs that the already weak eurozone economic situation is deteriorating anew and muted inflationary pressures, the ECB still seems unlikely to cut interest rates from 0.75% to 0.50% at today\u2019s April policy meeting. The ECB currently seems reluctant to take interest rates down from 0.75% to 0.50%, partly due to some doubts that such a move would have a beneficial impact given current fragmented conditions in credit markets. And there is a risk that this fragmentation could be magnified by the recent events in Cyprus. ING Bank says the services PMI, the strongest since August, increases the chances of the UK avoiding its third recession in less than five years, also described as a \"triple-dip\" downturn. Nonetheless, ING's James Knightley argues that it will be close, thanks to the chilling effect of the recent weather: [The PMI data] supports the evidence seen in the broader British Chambers of Commerce survey earlier this week, that the UK did post modest growth in the quarter. Consequently, this will further diminish the probability of any policy change at today\u2019s Bank of England MPC meeting. Nonetheless, we are concerned that bad weather in January and March could impact on the GDP calculations so we still think it will be 50:50 on whether the UK does indeed post a positive 1Q13 GDP number on 25 April. Here are a couple of previews of today's big bank announcements from RAN Squawk, on the Bank of England at noon and, soon after, the European Central Bank. Analysts appear to believe that the doves will again be in the minority on Threadneedle Street, with just three out of 37 contacted by RAN Squawk estimating a \u00a325bn increase in quantitative easing to \u00a3400bn. Markit, the data company that compiles the PMIs, says that the UK services data points to economic growth of 0.1% in the first three months of 2013. So the UK will just about squeak past the threat of a triple-dip recession after the economy contracted by 0.3% in the final quarter of last year. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: The government and Bank of England will breathe sighs of relief in seeing signs of a gathering upturn in the service sector during March, which looks set to have helped the UK avoid a triple-dip recession by the narrowest of margins. A caveat: Markit's survey does not include the public sector or retailers and focuses on areas such as transport and communication, business services and entertainment. Good news for the UK economy: Britain's services sector recorded its strongest expansion in seven months in March. This indicates that the UK will have escaped a triple dip recession, and George Osborne a horde of rampaging back benchers. The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index for the service sector - three-quarters of the UK economy - climbed to 52.4 in March compared with 51.8 in February. Anything above 50 denotes growth, and good news for the growth engine of the UK economy. And Anatole Kaletsky's take... Here is the FT's take on the Bank of Japan announcement. The PMI for the European services sector in March is out and it is poor. Markit's Eurozone services PMI, which surveys thousands of companies from restaurants to banks, showed a fall from 47.9 in February to 46.4 in March. Anything below the 50 threshold denotes contraction and this index has been below that level for all but one of the last 20 months. France's data in particular was worrying, falling to 41.9 compared with 43.1 in February. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the Cypriot crisis had yet to register on the eurozone economy. The recession is deepening once again as businesses report that they have become increasingly worried about the region's debt crisis and political instability. The unresolved election in Italy was commonly cited as a key factor clouding the economic outlook in March, and the botched bail-out of Cyprus could well filter through to a further worsening of business sentiment across the region in April. The futures market for German sovereign debt is indicating that the ECB will keep its key interest rate at a record low of 0.75%, but will give some positive hints about hints of monetary policy easing in the future. One trader told Reuters: \"Given where yields are, the risk is for the market to be disappointed if [ECB President mario Draghi] is not as dovish [as the market expects].\" The so-called \"Draghi put\", when the ECB boss said last year that he would do whatever it takes to save the euro, has played a key role in calming the markets. So Draghi is expected to keep up the interventionist rhetoric. This morning's announcement by the Bank of Japan is a significant development. It will boost the economy in the short-term but it has long-term implications for a gross national debt burden that, at more than 200% of GDP, is too big. An article on this subject appeared in the Atlantic Monthly a few months ago. It is worth reading because it implies that the BoJ can't just start the quantitative easing pump without fixing wider problems in its economy. An ageing population, and therefore a shrinking tax base, will not be able to pay off the debt. Spain is expecting to get away a \u20ac4bn bond sale with little difficulty today, because lower-rated sovereign debt has not been knocked heavily by events in Cyprus. Spanish 10-year bonds are trading with a yield - or interest rate - of around 4.9% this morning, well below the 7% that would have Mario Draghi and the bailout doctors running over the hill to Madrid. Mathias van der Jeugt, a rate strategist at KCB, says investors remain reassured by Draghi's promise last year to do whatever it takes to save the euro. The amount is quite low so it is easy to digest for investors ... [and] the Draghi put remains effective. Elsewhere, France plans to sell \u20ac6bn-\u20ac7bn of bonds this afternoon. France also has issues over growth but its main problem at the moment is the Cahuzac scandal. As one of our correspondents described it yesterday: \"Think of the Huhne scandal and multiply it by 1,000%.\" The UK economy may be stuck in a rut, but spare a thought for Japan after more than two \"lost decades\" of stagnant growth. This morning the Bank of Japan, under pressure from the new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, rather uncharacteristically brought out its bazooka. Read about it here. European stock markets have barely flickered, perhaps because they are used to central bank activism. Perhaps this will quell that positive start for the Spanish stock market: Spain's services sector has shrunk for the 21st successive month in March. Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index of services companies stood at 45.3, up slightly from February but still below the 50+ level that indicates growth. Markit's Andrew Harker said there were \"no real signs\" of encouragement for the services sector. He added: A number of firms envisage economic conditions to start improving towards the end of 2013m but it seems that in the near-term companies will have to continue operating in a worsening economic environment. Spain's economy entered its second recession since 2009 at the end of 2011, as the repercussions of a burst property bubble continue to rock the economy. The services sector - which accounts for just under half of GDP - has suffered the collateral damage as families rein in spending on restaurants and holidays. The UK is no different. The first, and most obvious, signs of wider repercussions to the Cypriot crisis. Judging by investors' reactions this morning, there is not much hope of the Bank of England and European Central bank taking a leaf out of the book of Abenomics. The FTSE is down 10 points at 6410 while its blue-chip counterparts are barely up. France's CAC 40 is up 0.4%, Spain's Ibex has risen 0.8% and Germany's Dax is up 0.4%. The first of the services PMI figures are out, from Ireland. They show that the country's services sector expanded at a slower pace in March, but at least the number is in positive territory. It slipped from 53.6 in February to 52.3 in March. Philip O'Sullivan, chief economist at NCB stockbrokers, said: The key positive from this morning's report is the continued strength in new export business. That Irish export boom - much of it thanks to non-Irish companies based in Ireland - is making finance ministers across Europe, including Mr Osborne, peruse Ireland's corporate tax rate of 12.5% and wonder whether it is worth copying. What price economic stability? It seems a snip at \u20ac45m (\u00a338.2m) but that's the price to the UK taxpayer that the Telegraph is putting on the \u20ac1bn bailout of Cyprus by the International Monetary Fund. The cost of letting Cyprus go under would have been greater though. Good morning everyone and welcome to today\u2019s eurozone blog. The main events today are interest rate and quantitative easing decisions at the Bank of England and European Central Bank, as well as services data from the UK and major eurozone economies. The outgoing governor of the BoE, Mervyn King, has swung behind further QE \u2013 injecting money into the economy by acquiring sovereign debt off institutions \u2013 but he is in a minority on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee. There is also mild expectation that the latest phase of the eurozone crisis in Cyprus will persuade the ECB under Mario Draghi to cut interest rates from 0.75% \u2013 where they have been since July 2012. Either way, both banks will do well to match the Bank of Japan for impact. This morning it confirmed radical changes to its approach, including the adoption of a substantial quantitative easing programme. The BoJ is trying to blow two decades of deflation out of the water. Back in Europe, there is a wave of purchasing managers index [PMI] data for the services industries in March. PMIs are culled from surveys of private sector companies, including indicators such as new orders and production. A reading of more than 50 indicates expansion and the data for the UK is viewed as a crucial factor in determining whether we avoid a triple dip recession or not.

Sales in Domino's 670 UK stores were up 6.6% in the first quarter of 2013 compared with the same period last year, the company reported, attributing strong growth in part to new products, such as a hot-dog stuffed crust pizza, as well as 'buy one get one free' offers. The pizza delivery firm did a roaring trade in the cold snap, shaking off the effects of snowfall that had previously hit sales. During the first seven weeks of 2013, when heavy snowfsnarled up traffic in many parts of the country, sales growth was 1.7%, but rose to over 12% in final six weeks of trading. \"All in all it was a very strong end to the quarter,\" said Lee Ginsberg, Domino's chief financial officer. \"Some of the really cold weather has been keeping people indoors.\" Domino's also reported that it now makes 62% of UK sales via the internet, up from 50% one year ago. Pizza lovers are increasingly using their smart phones to place their orders and tapped in \u00a382.4m of orders via mobile devices in the first quarter. Ginsberg said some stores had made 80% of their sales online during online promotions, which \"shows where the future is\". Domino's expansion shows no sign of slowing and the company confirmed plans to open 60 new outlets in the UK this year, as well doubling its franchises in Germany, taking the store count to 36. The company reported that sales in six \"mature\" stores in Germany rose 40% in the first quarter from a low base. The German business is not expected to be profitable until 2015.",

      "bodyText": "Bank of England policymakers voted against expanding their \u00a3375bn quantitative easing programme on Thursday, after a closely watched survey of the key services sector suggested the economy will avoid a triple-dip recession. The Purchasing Managers' Index, published by the data provider Markit, jumped to 52.4, from 51.8 in February, pointing to the fastest growth in the services sector since last August. The stronger-than-expected reading is likely to have helped hawks on the Bank's nine-member monetary policy committee to clinch the argument against an expansion of QE. At March's meeting, three members, including the governor, Sir Mervyn King, called for an extra \u00a325bn to be pumped into the economy, but were outvoted. Minutes of Thursday's gathering, to be published in a fortnight's time, will show whether King still believes more QE is necessary. Interest rates have now been at a record low of 0.5% for four years, and Thursday's MPC meeting was the first since the chancellor announced changes to the committee's remit at last month's budget, urging it to be flexible about how long it should take for inflation to return to target. But analysts said the new rules were unlikely to sway the MPC's more hawkish members, who are concerned about the Bank's failure to get a grip on inflation. \"We suspect that most of the six MPC members in the 'no change' camp for monetary policy at the previous two meetings would not have been persuaded by this mandate change to adjust their vote this time around,\" said Victoria Clarke, of Investec. Markit's chief economist, Chris Williamson, said the rise in the services index for March showed that strong growth in the sector, which includes banks and retailers, had just offset declining output in manufacturing and the struggling construction sector over the first three months of 2013. \"A gathering upturn in the service sector in March looks to have helped the UK avoid a triple-dip recession by the narrowest of margins. However, the weakness of private-sector growth signalled by the PMI data in the first quarter means that a flat GDP picture or even a decline could be seen if government sector output falls,\" he said. After GDP contracted in the final quarter of last year, another decline would mark a slide into a triple-dip recession. The Office for National Statistics will release an early estimate of first quarter economic growth later this month. Experts are divided about whether GDP has recovered, with the unseasonably cold weather increasing doubts about how the economy has performed. \"We expect the economy to have squeezed out GDP growth of 0.1%-0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter, but there is obviously major uncertainty over what the outcome will be,\" said Howard Archer, UK economist at the consultancy Global Insight. As well as a rise in the headline PMI, the details of the survey revealed some other upbeat signals about the health of the economy, including an increase in the size of companies' payrolls in March, and the fastest increase in new business for 10 months.",

      "bodyText": "Japan's central bank has promised to unleash a massive programme of quantitative easing \u2013 worth $1.4tn (\u00a3923bn) that will double the country's money supply \u2013 in a drastic bid to restore the economy to health and banish the deflation that has dogged the country for more than a decade. As part of a new set of policies known as Abenomics, formulated by Japan's new prime minister Shinzo Abe, the Bank of Japan will buy \u00a57tn yen (\u00a346bn) of government bonds each month using electronically created money, with the aim of rekindling demand and pushing up prices and wages. Haruhiko Kuroda, the Bank of Japan's new governor, described its stance as \"monetary easing in an entirely new dimension\". He promised to target a doubling in the size of the \"monetary base\" \u2013 the amount of cash circulating in the economy, plus the reserves held by financial institutions at the central bank \u2013 in the hope of stoking inflation of 2% within two years. The more aggressive approach to tackling Japan's economic problems had been well-trailed, but the scale of the BoJ's operation still stunned financial markets, pushing the Nikkei index of leading shares up by 2.2%. In a statement released on Wednesday in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan said it wanted to \"drastically change the expectations of markets and economic entities\", and \"lead Japan's economy to overcome deflation that has lasted for nearly 15 years\". The US Federal Reserve \u2013 an enthusiastic supporter of so-called \"unconventional\" monetary policies such as QE \u2013 is spending $85bn a month, only just above the $70bn planned by the BoJ, in an economy almost three times the size of Japan's. The radical new dose of quantitative easing comes alongside tax breaks from the government aimed at encouraging firms to raise wages, in the hope that consumers will respond by increasing spending, and allow prices to rise, too. Persistent deflation tends to encourage households to hoard their cash, as they wait for prices to fall further. Guy Foster, head of portfolio strategy at Brewin Dolphin, said: \"What is clear is that this is a concerted effort which is being \u2026 stage-managed for maximum effect. We also understand that there is a tremendous sense of support for such radical policy actions from the Ministry of Finance, Bank of Japan, and the Japanese private sector.\" The Bank of Japan's decision is likely to spark concerns that Tokyo is deliberately depressing the value of its currency in a bid to improve its export performance in a tough global trading environment. The yen fell sharply after the decision was announced, losing about 3% of its value against the dollar in Asian trading. David Bloom, currency strategist at HSBC, said: \"Policymakers will likely hope that yen weakness will be a side-effect of their QE strategy, but given the sensitivity of 'currency war' accusations, they will not want to actively target the exchange rate through rhetoric.\" The yield on Japanese government bonds hit a record low after the BoJ's announcement, which also included a pledge to buy bonds with maturities of up to 40 years, helping to bear down on long-term borrowing costs across the economy. It will also step up its purchases of other assets, including property funds. Central banks worldwide have been battling to convince investors they still have ammunition left despite interest rates being at rock-bottom levels for years. The Federal Reserve has used so-called \"forward guidance\", promising to keep stimulating the economy until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5%; George Osborne has asked the Bank of England to consider adopting a similar approach. \"It is not surprising that given the extreme set of economic conditions suffered by many countries and the resultant lack of flexibility now afforded by many central banks' main interest rates that a discussion over the appropriateness of policy tools should be gathering pace,\" said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank. \"While we remain sceptical of the ability of Japan to achieve 2% inflation over the next two years, governor Kuroda is at least stepping up the attack on deflation meaning that his chances of achieving some success have increased.\"",

      "bodyText": "Vodafone and China Mobile have waded into battle in Burma against a consortium that includes billionaire speculator George Soros and Irish entrepreneur Denis O'Brien, as telecoms firms vie for a share of the world's largest untapped mobile phone market. Telecoms will be among the first industries to be liberalised under Burma's reformist government, which hopes to place mobiles into the hands of between 75% and 80% of its 60 million citizens by 2016, up from an estimated 6% today. If take-up is high, the entire mobile market in Burma \u2013 renamed Myanmar by the ruling military junta \u2013 could be worth $10bn (\u00a36bn) a year, with networks generating $7.3bn of those revenues, research by Ericsson found. Foreign companies are eager to partake in what has been described as a mouthwatering opportunity, and by Thursday's deadline 22 bids had been submitted. Vodafone and China mobile, the world's two largest wireless companies, have made a joint application, with the British firm named as the \"experienced\" operator because of its extensive international holdings. \"Myanmar will be an important new market for the global mobile industry,\" the two companies said in a statement.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of Japan means business. That was the clear message to be drawn from the debut of the bank's new governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, brought in with the specific task of lifting the world's third biggest economy out of deflation. Kuroda has hit the ground running. He has pledged that the BoJ will bring inflation up to 2% within two years \u2013 a far more specific target than the markets were expecting \u2013 and provided details about how he intends to go about it. Firstly, the new governor will massively increase Japan's asset purchase scheme to flood the economy with money. The BoJ's quantitative easing programme has been dwarfed in recent years by the more aggressive action taken by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. Kuroda has now announced that he will increase the monetary base by 60 trillion yen to 70tn (\u00a3420bn-\u00a3490bn) a year \u2013 five times the rate of increase seen in 2012. Secondly, the BoJ will buy longer dated government bonds with an average maturity of three to seven years, but with bonds of up to 40 years eligible. The idea here is to show that the new government is in this for the long haul and will keep taking action to prevent the economy lapsing back into deflation. The interest rate on bonds moves inversely to their price, so when the BoJ buys long-dated bonds the price should go up and the interest rate on them should go down. That will mean lower long-term borrowing costs for households and companies. Financial markets were taken aback by all this. They were impressed by Kuroda's ability to walk the walk as well as talk the talk, and the immediate reaction was positive. Bond yields fell to record lows and the yen weakened on the foreign exchanges. A cheaper currency is one of the ways the BoJ hopes to raise inflation, because a falling yen will increase the cost of imports. Even so, doubts were still being raised about whether the new strategy will work. Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank, said the experience of Britain in the early 1980s showed how hard it was to target inflation using the monetary base. Mark Williams, Asia expert for Capital Economics, said monetary conditions in Japanese bond yields were already extremely loose and the government would have to convince the public that deflation \u2013 which has become ingrained over the past five years \u2013 will really come to an end. But both the obvious ways of doing this \u2013 a lower yen and higher consumption taxes \u2013 have their risks since they reduce the value of consumer spending power and could, by stifling economic growth, intensify deflationary pressure. Two lost decades since 1990 mean that Japan's problems will not be solved by one meeting, but for now the BoJ will be given the benefit of the doubt. After all the advance billing, Kuroda could easily have fallen flat on his face. Instead, he jumped his first hurdle with something to spare.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Organisers predict hundreds will boycott work on Thursday in planned protest against the notoriously low-wage industry", 
      "body": "<p>Hundreds of fast food industry workers in New York were due to go on strike on Thursday in the largest such action to ever hit the notoriously low-wage industry.</p> <p>Organisers behind the protest predict that some 400 workers will walk out or stay away from their jobs across the city in a move aimed at impacting at least 70 restaurants from big chains like McDonalds, Wendy's and Burger King.</p> <p>The workers are calling for wages of $15 an hour and the right to organise without the threat of retaliation or intimidation. It follows a previous protest in New York last November when 200 workers went on strike.</p> <p>Jonathan Westin, director of the Fast Food Forward Campaign, said that there was a dire need to raise wages in the fast food industry where many workers put in long hours on minimum wages and thus remained in poverty. There are some 50,000 fast food workers in New York who, organisers say, earn between $10,000 and $18,000 a year \u2013 making it difficult to get by in a city known for its sky-high rents and high prices. \"They can't pay rent. That is exactly the opposite the chief executives of the companies they work for who earn huge profits,\" he said.</p> <p>Westin said this second strike was aimed at building on the momentum of the first protest, which had previously been the largest action to hit the industry. That protest added to an already intense media debate over the rise of a low-wage economy in America as the country's economy struggles to recover.</p> <p>Westin said that some workers in New York City fast food restaurants had been warned by their managers not to take part in any further action. \"The corporations know that workers are organising. They have been told that they should not take actions and there is a chance that they could be fired,\" Westin said.</p> <p>However, that has not discouraged workers like Naquasia Legrand, a 21-year-old Brooklyn-born worker at fried chicken chain KFC. Legrand, who is joining the strike, said that she was barely able to make enough to get by as her wages were so low. \"You have to decide whether to feed your family or get a Metrocard so you can go to work. Or you have to choose between paying your rent or feeding your child,\" she said.</p> <p>Legrand, who also took part in last November's action, insisted she was not afraid of retaliation from her employer for walking off work. \"We have the right to do this. If anything happens we will retaliate back,\" she added.<br>The fast food strike is the latest attempt by workers' rights groups to target low-wage parts of the American economy. In the wake of the recession many of the jobs being created in the US are low-wage. Indeed fast-food restaurants have added jobs more than twice as fast as the average for the rest of the economy since the recovery began in June, 2009. Last year also saw a wave of strikes hit gigantic big box retailer Walmart.</p> <p>Organisers say that the booming low-wage economy hurts workers and contributes to a growing inequality in the country. They also say many workers in such low-wage restaurants also qualify for state assistance, such as food stamps, and so the government is effectively subsidising the workforce of huge corporations. \"Corporations are building a low-wage economy. It is the economy that we have become, but we have to lift these people out of poverty,' said Westin.</p> <p>The campaign has attracted widespread support among New York's clergy. Various leaders from churches, synagogues and mosques throughout the city are expected to join a series of pickets planned to spring up outside fast food restaurants from Harlem to Midtown. One of them is Imam Abdul Karim Rahim, who serves at a mosque in the Bronx. \"These workers need our support. They come and support us in the churches, the mosques and the synagogues. They are part of our congregations. But now we have to support them,\" he said.</p> <p>Organisers behind the strike have also sought to draw a link between the protest and the fact it is happening on the 45th anniversary of the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King. At the time of his death, King was campaigning on behalf of low-wage sanitation workers on strike in Memphis, Tennessee.

Organisers behind the protest predict that some 400 workers will walk out or stay away from their jobs across the city in a move aimed at impacting at least 70 restaurants from big chains like McDonalds, Wendy's and Burger King. The workers are calling for wages of $15 an hour and the right to organise without the threat of retaliation or intimidation. It follows a previous protest in New York last November when 200 workers went on strike. Jonathan Westin, director of the Fast Food Forward Campaign, said that there was a dire need to raise wages in the fast food industry where many workers put in long hours on minimum wages and thus remained in poverty. There are some 50,000 fast food workers in New York who, organisers say, earn between $10,000 and $18,000 a year \u2013 making it difficult to get by in a city known for its sky-high rents and high prices. \"They can't pay rent. That is exactly the opposite the chief executives of the companies they work for who earn huge profits,\" he said. Westin said this second strike was aimed at building on the momentum of the first protest, which had previously been the largest action to hit the industry. That protest added to an already intense media debate over the rise of a low-wage economy in America as the country's economy struggles to recover. Westin said that some workers in New York City fast food restaurants had been warned by their managers not to take part in any further action. \"The corporations know that workers are organising. They have been told that they should not take actions and there is a chance that they could be fired,\" Westin said. However, that has not discouraged workers like Naquasia Legrand, a 21-year-old Brooklyn-born worker at fried chicken chain KFC. Legrand, who is joining the strike, said that she was barely able to make enough to get by as her wages were so low. \"You have to decide whether to feed your family or get a Metrocard so you can go to work. Or you have to choose between paying your rent or feeding your child,\" she said. Legrand, who also took part in last November's action, insisted she was not afraid of retaliation from her employer for walking off work. \"We have the right to do this. If anything happens we will retaliate back,\" she added. The fast food strike is the latest attempt by workers' rights groups to target low-wage parts of the American economy. In the wake of the recession many of the jobs being created in the US are low-wage. Indeed fast-food restaurants have added jobs more than twice as fast as the average for the rest of the economy since the recovery began in June, 2009. Last year also saw a wave of strikes hit gigantic big box retailer Walmart. Organisers say that the booming low-wage economy hurts workers and contributes to a growing inequality in the country. They also say many workers in such low-wage restaurants also qualify for state assistance, such as food stamps, and so the government is effectively subsidising the workforce of huge corporations. \"Corporations are building a low-wage economy. It is the economy that we have become, but we have to lift these people out of poverty,' said Westin. The campaign has attracted widespread support among New York's clergy. Various leaders from churches, synagogues and mosques throughout the city are expected to join a series of pickets planned to spring up outside fast food restaurants from Harlem to Midtown. One of them is Imam Abdul Karim Rahim, who serves at a mosque in the Bronx. \"These workers need our support. They come and support us in the churches, the mosques and the synagogues. They are part of our congregations. But now we have to support them,\" he said. Organisers behind the strike have also sought to draw a link between the protest and the fact it is happening on the 45th anniversary of the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King. At the time of his death, King was campaigning on behalf of low-wage sanitation workers on strike in Memphis, Tennessee. Last week two of those strikers involved in the 1968 dispute travelled to New York and spoke to workers involved with the current fast food campaign at a series of pep talks in the city.",

      "bodyText": "Barclays bankers were engulfed in a culture of \"edginess\" and had a \"winning at all costs\" attitude which raised tensions with regulators and damaged its reputation, according to a review into the ethics of the embattled bank. In a 244-page report (pdf), which cost \u00a317m and was compiled after interviews with 600 individuals in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal, City lawyer-turned-banker Anthony Salz calls on Barclays to strengthen its board, co-operate more closely with City watchdogs and link its pay to the bank's \"long-term success\". Salz, who makes 34 recommendations, provides an insight into the pay of a cabal of the top 70 Barclays executives who received up to 35% more than peers at rivals, while 60 investment bankers benefited from a lucrative long-term bonus scheme that paid out \u00a3170m a year between 2002 and 2009. \"Based on our interviews, we could not avoid concluding that pay contributed significantly to a sense among a few that they were somehow unaffected by the rules,\" the report says. \"A few investment bankers seemed to lose a sense of proportion and humility.\" The review says the bank underestimated the reputational hit it took from its tax schemes. Data shows its controversial structured capital markets (SCM) arm made \u00a31bn of revenue a year between 2007 and 2010. The division, which is being shut down with its 100 staff being redeployed around the bank, generated revenues of \u00a39.5bn in the 11 years to 2011. The review also reveals that Barclays paid just \u00a382m in corporation tax to the exchequer in 2012 after top-line profits of \u00a37bn shrank to \u00a3246m. Salz found the most deep-rooted culture was inside the investment bank, which was focused on success. \"Winning at all costs comes at a price: collateral issues of rivalry, arrogance, selfishness and a lack of humility and generosity,\" he writes. The report \u2013 which puts a focus on the management of former chief executive John Varley \u2013 reveals that 728 Barclays bankers received more than \u00a31m in 2010. That number fell to 428 in 2012. The review, which does not attempt to blame any individuals for the damaging collapse in the bank's reputation, highlights the 10 years of rapid growth that took place as Barclays rose to become a top-five global bank under Varley. Varley, who handed the top job to Bob Diamond in January 2011, had an executive committee of six colleagues which did \"not develop a cohesive team at the top\", putting Diamond in charge of the investment bank and Frits Seegers \u2013 who left in 2009 \u2013 in charge of the retail bank where he instilled a \"culture of fear\". Diamond, who quit in July 2012 just days after the bank was fined \u00a3290m for rigging Libor, had taken steps to develop one culture across the bank, says Salz, who is a director of the Scott Trust, owner of the Guardian. Rothschild, where Salz is also a director, received \u00a31.5m in fees for his time. Salz says: \"Significant failings developed in the organisation as it grew. The absence of a common purpose or common set of values has led to conduct problems, reputational damage and a loss of public trust.\" He admitted that some Barclays staff had refused to be interviewed for the review and one City analyst described the report as an \"inappropriate use of trees\", alluding to its focus on the bank's past instead of its future challenges. Divisions previously run by Diamond's successor and current chief executive, Antony Jenkins, are also mentioned. Barclaycard had a culture of making money ahead of customer satisfaction. The retail bank focused on sales where loans sold with payment protection insurance generated two-and-a-half times more commission for staff than loans sold without the discredited insurance, which generated \u00a3400m in revenue a year for the bank. Jenkins has announced a new set of values and a programme of reform, although a survey of 9,000 staff by Salz found that 70% had a high degrees of scepticism about the changes. The review says the bank came across as \"too clever by half\" and that its battle to avoid a taxpayer bailout damaged its reputation. \"Barclays was sometimes perceived as being within the letter of the law but not within its spirit,\" the review says, describing \"an institutional cleverness\". The complicated Protium transaction it used to move loans off its balance sheet in 2009 had concerned regulators while Barclays could have communicated its 2008 fundraisings from Middle Eastern investors \u2013 now under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office \u2013 more clearly, according to the report. During crucial stress tests to assess its financial health, the bank was \"insufficiently sensitive\" about the way it presented the results. Sir David Walker, appointed chairman of Barclays in the wake of the Libor fine, said: \"The report makes for uncomfortable reading in parts\".",
