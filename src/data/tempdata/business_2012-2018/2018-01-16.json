      "bodyText": "The Metro has former Carillion boss Richard Howson in its sights, as he owns a six-bedroom ski chalet in the Alps.... Our latest Carillion story, about the strain on suppliers, is on tomorrow\u2019s front page: Hello again. Wednesday\u2019s front pages are coming through, and many are leading on the Carillion crisis. The Daily Telegraph\u2019s business section focuses on the meagre scraps that will be available to Carillion\u2019s creditors: City AM says Carillion\u2019s directors face mounting pressure as the \u2018fast-track\u2019 probe into their activities looms: The FT leads on those court papers, showing how Carillion had run so short of cash: The Morning Star predicts that Carillion\u2019s rivals will also be dragged into trouble: The dramatic collapse of Carillion has started to hit thousands of the firm\u2019s suppliers, as the real world impact of the demise starts to emerge, the Guardian reports tonight. Subcontractors owed money by the construction and services giant are already being pressurised by their banks and have begun laying off workers, as the threat of contagion afflicting the sector was likened to a near re-run of the banking crisis. Andrew Adonis, the former Labour transport minister, said: \u201cIt is a bit like Lehman Brothers [the Wall Street investment bank that collapsed in 2008]. You don\u2019t know what the impact will be. A very large part of Carillion\u2019s work was project management where subcontractors do the work, but these subcontractors don\u2019t know if they will be paid.\u201d The supplier concerns came as the liquidators PricewaterhouseCoopers said they would not pay any bills \u201cfor goods/services provided before the liquidation date [on Monday]\u201d, while Carillion workers providing services to private sector firms face having their wages stopped on Wednesday unless another employer steps in to take over. Here\u2019s our full story: The UK government is under growing pressure tonight over its handling of the collapse of Carillion, one of the UK\u2019s biggest contractors. Prime minister Theresa May has insisted that taxpayers should not have bailed out Carillion, which plunged into liquidation yesterday. She told a cabinet meeting that the government would be \u201cvigilant in monitoring for any emerging issues in public services\u201d at schools, hospitals, prisons and beyond. Labour, though, have accused ministers of \u2018colluding\u2019 to keep Carillion in business, even as it posted a string of profit warnings. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told parliament: \u201cWhen there were loud and clear worrying signs about Carillion, why, instead of intervening, did the Treasury Minister collude in the strategy of drip-feeding more contracts to Carillion to buoy up an obviously failing company?\u201d \u201cI put it no stronger than this: at this stage, there are real suspicions that the Government was too close to this company and too wedded to its privatisation role. The government is promising to provide support for thousands of British staff working for private-sector companies inside the stricken conglomerate. But their wages are only guaranteed until Wednesday under the current contingency plans. Unions have warned that the clock is ticking. They urged ministers to protect the 8,500 workers on private sector contracts, who fear losing their jobs and being unable to pay their mortgages. The TUC has called for a new National Task Force. It would protect jobs, pensions and services, and look for other serious problems in the outsourcing industry. Carillion\u2019s directors are also under the microscope. The government has ordered a \u2018fast-track\u2019 investigation into their conduct, and a full investigation of the work done by the company\u2019s auditors, KPMG. Papers filed at the high court show that Carillion\u2019s many creditors may get as little as 1p in the pound. That would be a very serious blow to small firms who were owed money for work they\u2019d carried out. Some have already begun firing staff. Although Carillion wasn\u2019t a household name, the collapse of such a major player in the outsourcing and construction industry has rattled the sector. Could other firms be next? My colleague Nick Fletcher has been kicking the tyres of rivals such as Serco, G4S, Capita and Balfour Beatty to test their resilience. Here\u2019s his verdict on Capita: About half of Capita\u2019s annual turnover of \u00a34.9bn comes from central and local government work, ranging from administering the teachers\u2019 pension scheme to providing tech services to the NHS, electronic monitoring services and running the Gas Safe register for the Health and Safety Executive. It has 70,000 UK employees, and a net debt of \u00a31.6bn compared with its market value of \u00a32.8bn. The company\u2019s shares have lost two-thirds of their value over the past two years after a series of profit warnings and boardroom changes. Here\u2019s Nick\u2019s full verdict: Accountancy firm PwC is under scrutiny tonight over its involvement in Carillion\u2019s collapse. PwC staff were appointed as \u2018special managers\u2019 yesterday, to help the Official Receiver run the company. But the firm doesn\u2019t come to the crisis with a blank slate - last year, it was advising Carillion\u2019s pension trustees, according to the Financial Times. These \u2018multiple roles\u2019 don\u2019t look great, the FT says tonight: The head of a rival accounting firm, who requested anonymity, added that PwC\u2019s appointment \u201csimply looks wrong\u201d. \u201cFrom a professional point of view they might just be the right side of the line [in terms of managing conflicts], but optically they will be on a hiding for nothing. Even if they are OK, they are not OK,\u201d he said. PwC, which is expected by other executives to earn as much as \u00a350m from the liquidation process, declined to comment. On the other hand.... the government could hardly appoint KPMG or Deloitte, as they have both acted as Carillion\u2019s auditors, while EY had also advised Carillion. That only leaves smaller firms, who might have less expertise or experience of such as massive job. The problem - as with the outsourcing sector - is that there are too few rivals, and thus less genuine choice. Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin agrees that lessons need to be learned from the Carillion crisis. Jenkin chairs the Public Accounts Committee, which announced an inquiry into the outsourcing of public services yesterday. Speaking on Channel 4 News, Jenkin says the government should \u201cexpand the pool of companies\u201d which it awards contracts too. The governments \u201cpreferred bidder system\u201d makes the assumption, perhaps wrongly, that bigger companies are safer than smaller ones - Jenkin adds. Unions have warned the government that the \u201cclock is ticking\u201d for thousands of Carillion workers. The GMB says there are at least 8,473 Carillion private sector workers in the UK, whose jobs are vulnerable following the firm\u2019s liquidation on Monday. GMB general secretary Tim Roache says the government must not \u201cthrow workers the wolves\u201d. Roache, who met business secretary Greg Clark this evening, says: \u201cThe clock is ticking for Carillion\u2019s 8,500 private sector workers, and the Government must now offer them reassurance and financial guarantees. \u201cNo worker should go hungry, default on a bill or miss a rent or mortgage payment because of a crisis they did not cause.\u201d The unions are worried because cabinet office minister David Lidington said yesterday that the government would only protect Carillion\u2019s private sector contracts for 48 hours. That raised fears that jobs cut start being cut on Wednesday.... Carillion\u2019s collapse means the company\u2019s workers and pensioners will soon be in the hands of the UK\u2019s pension\u2019s lifeboat. The Pension Protection Fund is widely expected to take on Carillion\u2019s pensions deficit, of around \u00a3580m. Those already taking pensions will be protected, but those members below retirement age will face cuts of 10-20%. The PPF has got the resources to cope. But my colleague Rupert Jones reports that its pockets are only so deep.... The former pensions minister Steve Webb told the Guardian that \u201cCarillion would be the biggest-ever hit on the PPF\u201d but that the lifeboat would be able to \u201ccomfortably absorb\u201d the Carillion scheme. Nigel Green, the chief executive of deVere Group, one of Britain\u2019s biggest independent financial adviser firms, said: \u201cUK final salary pension schemes have an enormous deficit black hole, which raises the inevitable question: how many more big hits can the PPF take?\u201d The Carillion liquidation, he said, \u201cshould trigger alarm bells for pension savers across the UK\u201d. Labour MP Rachel Reeves is also piling pressure on the government tonight. She\u2019s calling on ministers to urgently tighten Britain\u2019s corporate governance rules to prevent another Carillion crisis. Reeves, who chairs the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee, says firms shouldn\u2019t be allowed to pay out dividends when they\u2019re also reporting profit warnings or losing money. She told the BBC News that: In the end, the people who lose out when money is siphoned off is suppliers, workers, and when government contract are involved it\u2019s ultimately the British tax payer. It\u2019s not acceptable that those risks can be transferred to the taxpayers and employees, while the executives get the bonuses and the dividends. That\u2019s not right and the corporate governance code urgently needs to be tightened up in the light of this scandal. Here are the key quotes from shadow chancellor John McDonnell in parliament earlier today, as he called for \u201cfull transparency\u201d into the Carillion crisis. \u201cWhen there were loud and clear worrying signs about Carillion, why, instead of intervening, did the Treasury Minister collude in the strategy of drip-feeding more contracts to Carillion to buoy up an obviously failing company?\u201d \u201cI put it no stronger than this: at this stage, there are real suspicions that the Government was too close to this company and too wedded to its privatisation role. \u201cWe need full transparency on meetings and discussions that took place between Government ministers, civil servants and representatives of Carillion and what warnings were given to ministers and what actions recommended implemented or not. We now need the Treasury to start playing its proper role and provide an independent assessment of the potential costs and risks facing the taxpayer.\u201d In response Liz Truss, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, reiterated Theresa May\u2019s view that taxpayers shouldn\u2019t bail Carillion out. \u201cIt would be completely wrong for a company that had got itself in this state to be bailed out by the state and that is what we are not doing. Truss also accused McDonnell of taking \u2018cheap shots\u2019. \u201cI think that the Government is dealing with this in a responsible and measured way, rather than making cheap political shots at a time when people\u2019s jobs are in question and we are working to sort that out.\u201d The Federation of Small Businesses is alarmed to hear that Carillion\u2019s creditors might only recover 1% of the money they are owed (as flagged up earlier). The Evening Standard\u2019s Russell Lynch has the details: The revelation comes in a High Court witness statement submitted by the interim chief executive, Keith Cochrane, on the company\u2019s liquidation yesterday and seen by the Standard. Cochrane\u2019s account of the six-month prelude to the company\u2019s demise also delivers a broadside against the firm\u2019s lenders and reveals that private sector clients were refusing to give them new work in contrast with the Government, which awarded them major contracts on the HS2 rail scheme last summer. Carillion collapsed under the weight of \u00a31.6 billion in debts and a pension deficit of \u00a3587 million this week, leaving many suppliers facing ruin. But Cochrane\u2019s statement also refers to an \u201centity priority analysis\u201d by accountants EY, which had been working with the firm since the summer, on the impact of a potential failure of the bank last month. \u201cThis showed that the insolvency recovery for creditors in the event of a group-wide liquidation would be an average of between 0.8p in the pound and 6.6p in the pound,\u201d he wrote. The Federation of Small Businesses said: \u201cIf these figures are correct, many small businesses will not be able to cope with that kind of impact on their cashflow.\u201d Here\u2019s a video clip of John McDonnell telling MPs today that the government was \u201ctoo close\u201d to Carillion, and chose to \u201cdrip-feed\u201d contracts to the company rather than heed the warning signs. Shares in UK geotechnical engineering contractor Van Elle have tumbled by almost 8% today, after it told shareholders that it is owed \u00a31.6m by Carillion. The Carillion crisis has spurred many Guardian readers to write in with your views (as well as many excellent online comments, of course!). For example, Paul Davies of Goring, Oxfordshire, says ministers must be held to account: The government has been trumpeting its code that requires large companies to treat their suppliers fairly and pay them on the same terms as the government pays the big companies. Instead it has emerged that Carillion used its suppliers as a bank \u2013 refusing to pay them except on 120-day terms, while being paid on 30-day terms by the government. For the officials and ministers in so many departments to have turned a blind eye to this bullying by Carillion is a disgrace and it is surely time that both officials and ministers in transport, defence, health, education and elsewhere are held accountable for this total failure. If ministers weren\u2019t aware of this, the officials should be subject to disciplinary procedures. The brevity award goes to Rick Barker of Stocksfield, Northumberland: \u201cMore is not always better. Million, billion, trillion\u2026 Carillion.\u201d Tomorrow\u2019s newspaper includes a selection of the best, which are online here: Reuters has calculated that Carillion paid out $1bn (\u00a3775m) to its shareholders in dividends since the firm was created 19 years ago. The company has been criticised for its \u2018progressive dividend\u2019 policy -- basically boosting returns to investors each year. Had it paid out less, it could have done more to tackle its pension deficit (\u00a3580m), and could have trimmed its net debts, which swelled to \u00a3900bn by the time of its collapse. Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor John McDonnell has blamed \u201cshambolic Tory government and mismanagement by Carillion\u2019s fat-cat bosses for the company\u2019s collapse. Writing in the Guardian tonight, McDonnell says: Nothing has come to symbolise the worship of free market solutions \u2013 often against all the evidence \u2013 more than the persistent belief that key public services would be better provided by profit-seeking companies. As the journalist Robert Peston put it, the collapse of Carillion represents the definitive end of a 25-year love affair with the private provision of public services. The end of the affair has revealed some unedifying details about some of the participants in it: the apparent reliance by Carillion\u2019s management on \u201clow-balling\u201d bids to win them, then sweating suppliers and workers to squeeze a profit; Chris Grayling\u2019s insistence on awarding Carillion the HS2 contract even after its first profit warning; David Cameron\u2019s decision to appoint Carillion\u2019s chairman, Philip Green, as an adviser on corporate responsibility. McDonnell also points out that Labour has promised not to sign any new PFI contracts if it wins the next election, adding: If the Tories won\u2019t wake up to the reality of the changing economic landscape, it\u2019s time they stood aside and let us take over. Andrew Bounds, the Financial Times North of England correspondent, reports that there was little action at a Carillion site in Salford, Manchester, today: Here\u2019s a picture of Andy Bradley of Flora-Tec, who was forced to lay off 10 staff because he\u2019s owed \u00a3800,000 by Carillion (see this morning\u2019s posts) I think he\u2019s holding some mulch. Manure might be more appropriate, given the situation facing hundreds of Carillion\u2019s own suppliers. The agency Scottish Enterprise is setting up a hotline to help any Scottish companies affected by the collapse of Carillion, particularly on the \u00a31.5bn project to build the Aberdeen bypass. Keith Brown, the Scottish economy secretary, outlined the measures to MSPs this afternoon. Answering an emergency question at Holyrood, Brown said the 36-mile long Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) should continue without significant disruption as the two other firms in the consortium, Galliford Try and Balfour Beattie, were contractually obliged to keep the working going. The hotline number is 0300 013 3385. Businesses can also register their details at https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/help/contact-us However, details about the impact on the AWPR\u2019s delivery date, on contractors and employees, or on other Scottish businesses affected by Carillion\u2019s collapse, remain sketchy. Galliford Try and Balfour Beattie estimate it will cost them an extra \u00a360-\u00a380m to over Carillion\u2019s withdrawal from the AWPR project. Carillion also has facilities management contracts with Scottish public sector bodies, and is working for Network Rail and the Ministry of Defence in Scotland. The Scottish Builders Federation and Federation of Small Businesses have urged their members to come forward if problems emerge. Brown told Jackie Baillie, of Scottish Labour, some contracts may need to be taken over the public sector. The firms building the AWPR, a PFI-style scheme with a construction price of about \u00a3550m at 2012 prices but a total contract cost of \u00a31.47bn, have already admitted it is far more costly than expected. Galliford Try said in September it had lost \u00a389m on two fixed-price Scottish projects: the AWPR and the new Queensferry bridge over the Firth of Forth, and would no longer bid for fixed price public contracts. Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green party co-leader, urged Audit Scotland, the public spending watchdog, to include Carillion\u2019s collapse into its investigation into Scottish government PFI projects. The Audit Scotland inquiry was launched after the Guardian disclosed ministers had lost \u00a3450m in public borrowing on the AWPR because it breached strict European rules on how PFI projects are included in government accounts. The shockwaves from Carillion\u2019s liquidation has reached Canada, where the company employs 6,000 people. Canadian unions say the crisis shows that handing key public services to private companies is a mistake. They are pushing Ontario\u2019s provincial government to stop the privatisation of hospital service contracts. Reuters has the details: The call for the Canadian government to step in came from Unifor and the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions (OCHU/CUPE), which represents employees at the William Osler Health System, The Royal Ottawa Hospital, Halton Healthcare and the Sault Area Hospital. The hospitals have service contracts with Carillion, the unions said, adding the workers are among the 6,000 Canadian workers affected by the Carillion liquidation. \u201cIt is also time for these projects to be brought back into the public sector. The folly of private ownership of the hospitals is exposed fully by this bankruptcy,\u201d OCHU president Michael Hurley said in a statement. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has welcomed the government\u2019s decision to fast-track the investigation of Carillion\u2019s current and former directors. But, like John McDonnell earlier, he also wants ministers to answer questions about their actions. \u201cWe also need a National Audit Office probe, followed by parliamentary scrutiny by the Public Accounts Committee to fully understand what led to Carillion\u2019s collapse. \u201cWe need to know why the Government felt it was not wrong to feed Carillion lucrative public sector contracts when they knew the company was in severe trouble because of its profit warnings.\u201d ITV\u2019s Joel Hills has more details of the Carillion witness statement, and it\u2019s very bad news for creditors: Those creditors will include big banks, and also small firms who were contracted by Carillion such as Flora-tec which is already sacking staff. Nationwide Building Society has agreed to pay around 250 Carillion employees who work its data centres and head office until the end of this month. However, the future of up to 1,500 workers who clean its national branch network hangs in the balance, as the government is only protecting private-sector contract workers until Wednesday. Tim Poil, general secretary of the Nationwide Group Staff Union, which directly represents 250 Carillion employees, said: \u201cWe have been negotiating with Nationwide since the end of last week. Nationwide has said to the Carillion employees on the Nationwide contract - about 250 in total - that they will ensure they will be paid to the end of the month.\u201d The 250 staff are understood to be maintenance engineers in the data centres, who were transferred from Nationwide to Carillion in 2008, plus reception and security staff at the society\u2019s Swindon headquarters. Carillion is also responsible for the cleaning of Nationwide\u2019s 650 branches around the country - but had itself outsourced the work to other companies. The number of cleaners could be as high as 1,200 to 1,500, said Poil. \u201cMy understanding is that Nationwide has been in touch with the company to ensure the branches do get cleaned,\u201d said Poil, but their future contractual arrangements remain very unclear. A major problem for private sector employers that outsourced to Carillion, said Poil, is that the company is officially neither in adminstration or insolvency. If Pricewaterhouse Coopers sells the service contracts to another outsourcing company, then the unions expect employees to be transferred (or Tupe\u2019d) over to the new employer with existing terms and conditions. But if Carillion is declared insolvent, then employers will have to decide whether to take employees back in house or hurriedly obtain a new outsourcing company to do the work. Poil says: \u201cMy question to Nationwide is, should you really be outsourcing these sorts of services? It might have looked good at first, but it has fallen apart. If they say to us again they want to outsource some work currently done in house, we\u2019ll be saying, Carillion? Are you sure?\u201d An official spokesperson for Nationwide said the society hopes to issue a formal statement later today. The FT reports that Carillion had reached a perilous financial position by the time it fell into liquidation on Monday morning. Their reporter, Gill Plimmer, explains writes: Carillion was left with just \u00a329m in cash when it collapsed, according to a document that reveals the extent of the construction company\u2019s financial black hole. Papers seen by the Financial Times show the insolvent construction company owed \u00a31.29bn to its banks, including a \u00a3790m revolving credit facility and \u00a3349m in private placement notes. The papers also show that two firms were unwilling to become administrators, as they feared they might not get paid..... Newsflash: America\u2019s stock market has hit a new alltime high, as the bull market continues. The Dow Jones index jumped by 0.86%, or 223 points, to 26,027. This is the first time it has ever burst over the 26k mark. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaw are also at new peaks. Now, the Dow isn\u2019t a great measure of the US economy (or even the wider stock market, really). And this is just an arbitrary number. But, the speed at which shares are rising is remarkable - it\u2019s less than two weeks since the Dow burst through 25,000. Sky News is reporting that Carillion\u2019s interim chief executive, Keith Cochrane, has accused Royal Bank of Scotland of undermining efforts to keep it afloat. Cochrane apparently criticised banks, including RBS, in a witness statement filed at the High Court Sky\u2019s Mark Kleinman reports: According to Mr Cochrane\u2019s witness statement, RBS informed Carillion last Thursday that it wanted the company to pre-fund supplier payments made through the bank, which meant it would need to make those payments two days earlier than cashflow forecasts had assumed. He said this negatively impacted Carillion\u2019s liquidity by between \u00a32m and \u00a320m. RBS, he added, insisted that this revised arrangement \u201cwould be in place until support from [the Government] had been agreed and that the terms of this support would determine whether other uncommitted facilities with RBS would be withdrawn\u201d. Having been bailed out in 2008, RBS is still majority-owned by the taxpayer -- who of course is now on the hook for potential costs at Carillion. The UK division of Spanish bank Santanter has also been blamed, for making changes to Carillion\u2019s \u2018Early Payment Facility\u2019 - used to make payments to suppliers. Cochrane says: \u201cThe company relied upon that EPF in order to assist it making payments to its suppliers. \u201cSantander informed the group\u2019s suppliers that arrangements to automatically prepay invoices submitted by the supplier would be terminated and it sent a separate email to certain of its suppliers that \u2018all payments with Carillion are stopped\u2019. Theresa May told her cabinet that the \u201ctaxpayer could not be expected to bail out a private company\u201d following the collapse of Carillion, according to her official spokesman. He said the prime minister addressed the issue at the start of this morning\u2019s meeting of her top team of ministers, arguing that a lot of work had gone into trying to find suitable financing options but that had not proved possible. The spokesman made clear that in the short term the government would ensure that public services carried out operating, but that was simply replicating money that would have gone to the company - rather than pushing up the bill for taxpayers. They admitted that public money would have to go to paying the receiver. However, a Whitehall source denied the suggestion that the money could run into the hundreds of millions, saying \u201cit will be nowhere near that\u201d. The official spokesman said May thanked David Lidington and other departments for making contingency arrangements. \u201cThe PM said that public services had continued to be provided but there would be no complacency,\u201d he added. \u201cShe said Government would be vigilant in monitoring for any emerging issues in public services and in providing support for employees of companies with private sector Carillion contracts.\u201d Business secretary, Greg Clark, also briefed the cabinet about his call for a fast-track investigation into the conduct of Carillion\u2019s directors. The spokesman said: \u201cThis means the Official Receiver\u2019s investigation will consider whether those who are, or were previously directors of the company may have caused detriment to those owed money, including workers and businesses affected.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has accused the UK government of colluding to support Carillion by \u2018drip-feeding\u2019 it with contracts. Speaking on Sky News, McDonnell said ministers erred by keeping handing Carillion contracts in recent months, after July\u2019s profit warning. McDonnell is urging openness and transparency: We need a full public inquiry, immediately, to find out exactly what happened. We want to know what the government\u2019s involvement in all this is. McDonnell says the government needs to reveal how much the taxpayer could lose, now that the Official Receiver has taken control of Carillion. This could be a bottomless pit if we\u2019re not careful. Greg Clark\u2019s call for a \u2018fast-track\u2019 investigation comes \u201cso late\u201d in the day, McDonnell continues, suggesting that the government has serious questions to answer: Government ministers seem to have colluded in a strategy where, even when they know the company was in trouble, when the company\u2019s share price was collapsing and there were profit warnings and resignation [they] still drip-fed this company with public contracts. It was just a strategy that was bound to fail, and put pressure on workers and unfortunately now taxpayer as well. City AM\u2019s Cat Neilan has tweeted Greg Clark\u2019s letters, which ratchet up the pressure on Carillion\u2019s management, and its auditors at KPMG. Newsflash: The UK\u2019s Department for Business is pushing for a \u201cfast-track\u201d investigation into Carillion\u2019s directors. Business secretary Greg Clark has written to the Insolvency Service and the Official Receiver, asking for the statutory investigation into the conduct of Carillion\u2019s directors to be fast-tracked and extended in scope The probe will examine whether any Carillion directors, past or present, committed any misconduct or harmed creditors, workers and other businesses. Clark has also asked the Financial Reporting Council to examine how Carillion\u2019s accounts were prepared, and the actions of its auditors -- KPMG. Clark says: It is important we quickly get the full picture of the events which caused Carillion to enter liquidation, which is why I have asked the Insolvency Service to fast-track and broaden the scope of the Official Receiver\u2019s investigation. In particular, I have asked that the investigation looks not only at the conduct of the directors at the point of its insolvency, but also of any individuals who were previously directors. Any evidence of misconduct will be taken very seriously. Clark is also due to meet with the heads of the TUC and Unite union, Frances O\u2019Grady and Len McCluskey, later today. Yesterday, Carillion\u2019s management were heavily criticised for changing their bonus rules, making it harder to claw back payments. The Institute of Directors called the move \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d Nicky Morgan MP asks Philip Hammond how the government will help small firms who are struggling to pay wages and their tax liabilities. Hammond says HMRC already has a scheme to help firms who have problems pay their tax bills. Ministers have agreed that HMRC should \u2018signpost it\u2019 on the government\u2019s Carillion information websites. Shadow chancellor John McDonell warns the government that thousands of Carillion employees will turn up to work tomorrow, not knowing if they have a job. Workers in the supply chain also face an uncertain future, McDonell adds. He asks how many PFI contracts were signed off by the Treasury under Philip Hammond, and what will happen to the people who work on them. And why did ministers \u201ccollude in the strategy of drip-feeding more contracts\u201d to \u201cbuoy up an obviously failing company\u201d? Chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, says the government\u2019s priority is to keep supplying public services and support Carillion\u2019s workers. But it would be wrong to prop up a private company that got itself into difficulties. Over in parliament, chancellor Philip Hammond has been quizzed about the Carillion crisis. Labour MP Helen Goodman asks about what protection is being provided to the Official Receiver, which took control of Carillion\u2019s operations after it fell into liquidation yesterday. Hammond confirms that the government has given the Receiver an indemnity, to protect it from any losses. It also has a credit line to cover costs, which can be recovered from government departments in teh future. Q: What exposure does the government have to Carillion, though loans to the company or support for exports? Hammond says he isn\u2019t aware of any direct exposure to Carillion, but will check. The TUC says its proposed Carillion taskforce would have five priorities: involve unions to give Carillion workers certainty on their jobs, pay and pensions; bring Carillion\u2019s public-sector contracts back in-house to ensure consistent delivery; support transfer of private sector contracts to alternative providers with jobs, pay and pensions protected; fund a training and financial support package for at-risk workers and apprentices; and perform a risk assessment on other large outsourcing firms to avoid another crisis. BREAKING: Britain\u2019s trade unions are calling for a \u2018national taskforce\u2019 to be set up, to protect UK firms from the collapse of Carillion. The TUC, which represents many UK trades unions, says the government needs to take urgent action to protect workers at Carillion, and across the wider economy. It also wants ministers to conduct \u2018risk assessments\u2019 of other large outsourcing firms, to see if they are facing similar problems Yesterday the West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, the former boss of John Lewis, said he had set up a taskforce to assist Carillion suppliers and subcontractors. The TUC are pushing for a much larger initiative, though. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says: \u201cWe urgently need a national taskforce involving unions to safeguard jobs, services, and pensions. \u201cWorkers can\u2019t be left at the back of the queue. Each and every worker at Carillion needs to know where they stand. They have bills and mortgages to pay, and deserve certainty on their future. \u201cAnd we have to ensure that there aren\u2019t more Carillions on the horizon. That means an immediate risk assessment of all large outsourcing firms with government contracts. Public services are already under pressure, and can\u2019t take another hit like this.\u201d The Treasury have created a little video to show how they\u2019re helping Britons cope with inflation: No mention of the public sector pay cap, though, or the surge in import costs cause by the weak pound.... Getting back to Carillion....and the Bank of England has reassured MPs that Britain\u2019s financial system won\u2019t be shaken by the firm\u2019s collapse. Sam Woods, deputy governor for prudential regulation, told the Treasury committee that he has checked banks and insurance groups\u2019 exposure to Carillion on Friday - as it tried (in vain) to reach a rescue deal with its creditors. Woods said: \u201cThe direct exposures are entirely manageable across all institutions.\u201d It\u2019s harder to tell what the full impact will be, though, as smaller firms (such as Flora-tec and Van Elle) count the cost. Woods says \u201cWill there be a wider indirect issue with all the suppliers?... That is a more difficult one. I am not massively worried about it.\u201d Aberdeen Standard Investments chief economist Lucy O\u2019Carroll warns that inflation will only fall slowly this year: \u201cToday\u2019s headline number doesn\u2019t amount to a hill of beans in isolation. But it\u2019s more interesting in the context of what\u2019s been happening with inflation lately. It appears to be steadying around 3%, and could stay close to this level for the next few months. Looking a little further into 2018, inflation is likely to drift down gradually as the rise in prices caused by the pound\u2019s decline falls out of the numbers. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, is also hopeful that UK inflation has passed its peak: \u201cLast month saw CPI inflation fall slightly to 3%. Much of the recent rise in inflation was driven by sterling\u2019s devaluation during 2016. \u201cHowever, this factor will begin to fade and inflation should fall back towards the 2% target over the coming year, with Producer Prices figures already showing input price inflation falling sharply.\u201d But Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, remains cautious: \u201cWe can finally breathe a small sigh of relief as inflation has slightly fallen. We\u2019re by no means back to the luxury of low inflation but the fact it hasn\u2019t risen again gives us a slight helping hand. \u201cWe aren\u2019t out of the woods yet though, for many of us prices are still rising faster than wages, so purse strings will still be tight. The cost of everyday items like food and household goods as well as transport continue to push up the cost of living, so budgeting is key. BBC economics correspondent Andrew Verity has dug into the inflation data, and spotted some big cost increases: But BlackRock\u2019s Rupert Harrison (a former top Treasury official) hopes that the worst is over: Fund manager BlackRock, incidentally, is one of the firms who short-sold Carillion\u2019s shares -- the resulting profits mean it isn\u2019t too worried about a cost of living squeeze..... The pound has dropped by 0.2% following the inflation figures, as City traders calculate that it makes an early interest rate rise less likely. This has pushed the FTSE 100 index up to 7791 points, a whisker away from a new all-time high. This drop in inflation shows that the impact of the pound\u2019s sharp tumble after the Brexit vote is now fading. Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, explains: \u201cConsumers will breathe a sigh of relief that escalating living costs are showing signs of abating. The Brexit vote brought with it the side effect of depreciating sterling, and the subsequent rise in import costs, pushing inflation well beyond the Bank of England\u2019s target. These effects are dissipating somewhat, and core inflation remains lower still. But she also warns that real wage growth \u201cremains elusive\u201d, so household budgets will remain tight until earnings accelerate. Britain\u2019s financial \u2018pinch\u2019 seems to be easing, says Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics: \u201cThe good news is that inflation appears to have peaked. We expect inflation to fall fairly sharply, to around 2.5% by Spring, which will ease the pressure on household budgets. \u201cThat said, food inflation remains near four-year high and petrol prices rose sharply as the continued impact of Brexit and rising commodity prices fed through supply chains. This is from James Tucker of the Office for National Statistics: The UK government will be relieved to see Britain\u2019s inflation rate fall, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: \u201cAmidst the negative headlines around the collapse of Carillion, there is some more positive news for Prime Minister Theresa May this morning, as December\u2019s inflation figure has eased slightly from its six-year high in November. \u201cWith inflation dropping, and sterling back to its highest level since the Brexit referendum, there is a growing feeling of optimism around the British economy at the moment, with many predicting inflation will fall closer to the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target in 2018. \u201cHowever, with wage growth lagging well behind, it will be a long time before this positive news translates into people having more money in their pockets.\u201d Good news for households -- Danske Bank analysts suggest Britain\u2019s inflation rate may have now peaked. Bad new for workers -- WorldFirst economist Jeremy Cook fears wages won\u2019t overtake inflation for some time Economist Rupert Seggins flags up that \u2018core inflation\u2019, which strips out volatile factors like food and energy, has dropped. But financial journalist Simon Read points out that high street saving accounts aren\u2019t keep pace with the cost of living. Despite December\u2019s dip in inflation, the cost of food, household goods and transport services pushed the cost of living up. The Office for National Statistics says the downward effect on inflation came mainly from air fares, along with a fall in the prices of a range of recreational goods, particularly games and toys. But... The downward contributions were partially offset by an increase in tobacco prices, reflecting duty increases that came into effect following the Autumn Budget, along with an increase in petrol and diesel price. This chart shows how inflation (in yellow) has finally started falling for the first time in six months. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s inflation rate has fallen for the first time since last June. The Consumer Prices index rose by 3.0% in December, down from 3.1% in November (a six-year high) That means that Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze has eased a little (although prices are still rising faster than wages, which grew by 2.3% in the last year). More to follow.... Economics professor Mariana Mazzucato says Carillion\u2019s collapse should trigger a fundamental rethink about how public services are supplied, and paid for: Julia Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, says small companies who supplied Carillion face little prospect of being paid. Palmer told Wake Up To Money: There\u2019s an order of priority. Secured creditiors will be paid first, ahead of unsecured creditors, of whom there will be be a very large number. Many sub-contractors will be reeling, wondering how on earth they recover from this. Top UK government ministers are expected to discuss Carillion\u2019s collapse later today, when Theresa May\u2019s cabinet meet at Downing Street. Last night, ministers held a meeting on the crisis. Afterwards, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington claimed efforts to deal with the crisis had \u201cgone pretty well\u201d. Lidington added: \u201cThe message today was that day one had gone pretty well, people were turning up to work, we had not had reports of any serious disruption to service delivery.\u201d UK\u2019s horticultural services company Flora-tec has been badly hit by the collapse of Carillion, giving a chilling example of the \u2018domino effect\u2019 that could hit the UK economy. The firm faces a loss of \u00a3800,000 on work carried out for Carillion -- and took the dramatic step of laying off 10 people yesterday after the liquidation. Andy Bradley, managing director of Flora-tec, told the BBC\u2019s Wake Up To Money programme that his firm provided \u2018ground maintenance\u2019 at schools and hospitals. His staff were up at 3am during last month\u2019s cold snap -- clearing snow and putting salt down. But he doesn\u2019t expect to be paid for that work; a serious blow, as \u00a3800,00 is over 10% of annual turnover. Bradley warns that he now faces \u201ca massive black hole in our accounts\u201d with no guarantee that he will ever be repaid. He was damning about the government\u2019s role in the crisis. They encouraged small firms such as Flora-tec to get involved in public sector contracts, Bradley explains. And they also kept handing Carillion contracts after last summer\u2019s profits warning; if Westminster trusted Carillion, why wouldn\u2019t a small SME? Yesterday\u2019s liquidation was a \u2018sucker punch\u2019 says Bradley, adding: I had to make 10 people redundant yesterday. that\u2019s 10 people with mortgages and car loans It\u2019s an absolute disgrace... I\u2019ve got people to pay. I\u2019ve not got the money to pay them. Infrastructure investment company John Laing has told the City that it can handle Carillion\u2019s collapse. John Laing has nine \u2018operational PPP (public partnership) projects where Carillion are the Facilities Management provider, 4 schools projects, 4 emergency services projects and 1 road project. But Carillion\u2019s demise isn\u2019t a shock - John Laing has drawn up contingency plans, and is now seeking to replace Carillion with another facilities management (FM) firm without disruption John Laing says: The Investment Adviser\u2019s asset management team have been aware of the issues affecting Carillion and have had contingency plans in place for some time. These have involved discussions with a number of potential replacement providers and the Investment Adviser is in the process of implementing these contingency plans and seeking to appoint alternative FM providers on all of the 9 projects to replace Carillion. At this stage the Investment Adviser expects that this can be achieved with minimal service disruption and minimal additional cost. BUT... that may also mean job losses at Carillion, if companies such as John Laing take their business elsewhere.... Several construction and engineering firms have updated the City this morning about the Carillion crisis. Van Elle, a geotechnical engineering* contractor, told shareholders that it is currently owed \u00a31.6m by Carillion for various contracts in December, and work taking place in January. Van Elle says it faces an \u2018adverse financial impact\u2019 if it can\u2019t get this money back It also had orders from Carillion worth \u00a32.5m of revenue, for this year and beyond [for comparison, the company\u2019s revenues were \u00a394m last year] CEO Jon Fenton says Carillion\u2019s collapse is \u2018disappointing\u2019. Shares in Van Elle have plunged by almost 10% in early trading * - complicated foundations, ground work, that kind of thing. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze may finally be easing, after a tough year for UK households. New inflation figures, due this morning, are expected to show that price pressures eased a little last month. The Consumer Prices Index is tipped to have fallen to 3.0% in December, down from near six-year high of 3.1% struck in November. If so, that would suggest that the slump in the pound after the EU referendum has finally worked its way through the system. And with sterling back at a post-Brexit hit - close to the giddy heights of $1.38 -- inflation might keep dipping in 2018. However, few citizens will be firing off any leftover party poppers. Wages are only growing at around 2.3% per year, which means people are still getting a pay cut in real terms. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets suspects that inflation could be \u2018stickier\u2019 than some economists expect. He says: Last month the Bank of England governor found himself having to pen a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining the reasons as to why the Bank of England had exceeded its headline inflation target by more than 1%, after CPI came in at 3.1% for November, the highest level since March 2012. Later this morning we\u2019ll find out if the December numbers have fallen back from those heady peaks. While most expectations are for that indeed to be the case, with a drop back to 3%, one can\u2019t help feeling that this optimism might well be misplaced. Airfares were a key component that underpinned the CPI number in November and it is quite likely that could happen again, furthermore fuel prices also rose in December. The one bright spot could well be food and drink with shop price inflation expected to be on the soft side. Core CPI is expected to slip back a touch to 2.6% from 2.7% It seems more probable that inflation is likely to remain stickier than usual for the next couple of months as the January effect of higher rail fares also bleeds through into the numbers. It should then start to soften towards the end of Q1 assuming the pound stays at its current levels. We\u2019ll also be keeping an eye on the Carillion crisis. The demise of the UK construction and services group is turning into a major political row; as we covered last night, Labour are calling it a \u2018watershed moment\u2019, and demanding an end to \u2018rip-off\u2019 privatisations. Thousands of Carillion workers are now nervously wondering about their future, as the government is only protecting staff on private sector work until Wednesday. Scores of small firms up and down the country also face disruption and the threat of unpaid bills, and may soon be taking tough decisions. But life goes in on the City; retailer JD Sports, cakes and sauces maker Premier Foods, bakers chain Greggs, and estate agent Savills are all reporting results. The agenda: 9.30am GMT: UK CPI and RPI inflation figures for December 9.30am GMT: UK house price index for November 1.30pm GMT: US Empire manufacturing data (tracking factory output in and around New York) We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

The number of cleaners could be as high as 1,200 to 1,500, said Poil.</p> <p>\u201cMy understanding is that Nationwide has been in touch with the company to ensure the branches do get cleaned,\u201d said Poil, but their future contractual arrangements remain very unclear.</p> <p>A major problem for private sector employers that outsourced to Carillion, said Poil, is that the company is officially neither in adminstration or insolvency. If Pricewaterhouse Coopers sells the service contracts to another outsourcing company, then the unions expect employees to be transferred (<a href=\"http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1655\">or Tupe\u2019d</a>) over to the new employer with existing terms and conditions.</p> <p>But if Carillion is declared insolvent, then employers will have to decide whether to take employees back in house or hurriedly obtain a new outsourcing company to do the work.</p> <p>Poil says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cMy question to Nationwide is, should you really be outsourcing these sorts of services?

And with sterling back at a post-Brexit hit - close to the giddy heights of $1.38 -- inflation might keep dipping in 2018.</p> <p>However, few citizens will be firing off any leftover party poppers. Wages are only growing at around 2.3% per year, which means people are still getting a pay cut in real terms.</p> <p><strong>Michael Hewson of CMC Markets </strong>suspects that inflation could be \u2018stickier\u2019 than some economists expect.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Last month the Bank of England governor found himself having to pen a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining the reasons as to why the Bank of England had exceeded its headline inflation target by more than 1%, after CPI came in at 3.1% for November, the highest level since March 2012. Later this morning we\u2019ll find out if the December numbers have fallen back from those heady peaks. </p> <p>While most expectations are for that indeed to be the case, with a drop back to 3%, one can\u2019t help feeling that this optimism might well be misplaced.</p> <p>Airfares were a key component that underpinned the CPI number in November and it is quite likely that could happen again, furthermore fuel prices also rose in December.

      "bodyText": "Trade unions have demanded that a taskforce be set up to help deal with the fallout from the Carillion collapse and accused ministers of failing to adequately prepare for the demise of the outsourcing firm. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, told the business secretary, Greg Clark, on Tuesday night he needed to set up a body including representatives from unions and companies in Carillion\u2019s supply chain in the next few days, to ensure knowledge was shared to establish exactly who was at risk. The union leader said Clark was \u201cin listening mode\u201d at the meeting, which was attended by Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite. She added, however, that she was scheduled to speak to him again on Wednesday to see if progress could be made because \u201cwe have all seen warm words not backed up with action\u201d. Unions are worried about the impact on both sub-contractors and Carillion employees; O\u2019Grady said half a dozen suppliers to the stricken company had already contacted the Insolvency Service because they were concerned about their futures. \u201cIt is self evident that, had the government been prepared, we would not have been in this situation,\u201d she said. Ministers have repeatedly said they had been monitoring Carillion since the company issued a profits warning in July, although since then it had been awarded eight contracts, including joint-venture deals to help build the HS2 railway line. But it has emerged that a crown representative, whose job it is to monitor major suppliers to government, had been rotated off the company in the summer and not re-appointed until October. Earlier on Tuesday, ministers asked the Insolvency Service \u2013 which is handling the liquidation of Carillion \u2013 to fast-track an investigation into the conduct of the directors who ran the outsourcing company. Former chief executive Richard Howson was reportedly being paid a \u00a3660,000 salary until October, despite quitting his post after a profit warning in the summer. Clark said: \u201cIt is important we quickly get the full picture of the events which caused Carillion to enter liquidation, which is why I have asked the Insolvency Service to fast-track and broaden the scope of the Official Receiver\u2019s investigation. \u201cIn particular, I have asked that the investigation looks not only at the conduct of the directors at the point of its insolvency, but also of any individuals who were previously directors. Any evidence of misconduct will be taken very seriously.\u201d The Official Receiver has the power to investigate the circumstances that led to the collapse of Carillion, going back many years if it deems necessary. Labour sought to press home the argument that the Carillion crisis proved that the idea of private finance initiatives was fundamentally flawed. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, wrote on the Guardian: \u201cNothing has come to symbolise the worship of free market solutions \u2013 often against all the evidence \u2013 more than the persistent belief that key public services would be better provided by profit-seeking.\u201d The party has said the company\u2019s contracts should be brought back into the public sector to contain the situation. Michael Gove, however, said any failure was company specific. The environment secretary told the BBC the Insolvency Service needed to \u201clook to the specific circumstances of this company\u2019s operation\u201d. Ministers made clear after the cabinet meeting on Tuesday that no immediate nationalisations were on the table. Theresa May told the cabinet that the \u201ctaxpayer could not be expected to bail out a private company\u201d, her official spokesman said. The prime minister argued that a lot of work had gone into trying to find suitable financing options but it had not proved possible. The spokesman made clear that in the short term the government would ensure public services continued, paid for with money that would have gone to the company to provide those services, rather than pushing up the bill for taxpayers. Unions said the government\u2019s decision only to provide support for public sector contracts meant some people who worked on the rail network were at risk of losing their jobs. The RMT rail union wrote to the Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, asking if 600 workers providing cleaning services for Arriva Rail North and track maintenance for Network Rail were part of contracts that qualified for ongoing public support. The union said it had received no reply from the minister. \u201cOur argument is that these are public sector contracts because they provide a public service,\u201d a spokesman said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The dramatic collapse of Carillion has started to hit thousands of the firm\u2019s suppliers, as the real world impact of the demise starts to emerge. Subcontractors owed money by the construction and services giant are already being pressurised by their banks and have begun laying off workers, as the threat of contagion afflicting the sector was likened to a near re-run of the banking crisis. Andrew Adonis, the former Labour transport minister, said: \u201cIt is a bit like Lehman Brothers [the Wall Street investment bank that collapsed in 2008]. You don\u2019t know what the impact will be. A very large part of Carillion\u2019s work was project management where subcontractors do the work, but these subcontractors don\u2019t know if they will be paid.\u201d The supplier concerns came as the liquidators PricewaterhouseCoopers said it would not pay any bills \u201cfor goods/services provided before the liquidation date [on Monday]\u201d, while Carillion workers providing services to private sector firms face having their wages stopped on Wednesday unless another employer steps in. The developments represented another frantic day following the collapse of Carillion, which went into compulsory liquidation with debts of \u00a3900m on Monday. They included: The government telling the Insolvency Service to fast-track an investigation into the conduct of Carillion directors, and ordering a full investigation of the work done by the company\u2019s auditors, KPMG. The accountancy firm gave Carillion a clean bill of health last March. The revelation that Carillion had just \u00a329m in cash left when it collapsed, with two top accounting firms \u2013 PwC and EY \u2013 refusing to act as its administrators because they feared not being paid. Carillion\u2019s creditors being warned in court documents they are likely to receive less than 1p for every pound owed. A host of major British firms \u2013 including British Gas owner Centrica, Nationwide building society and Arriva Rail \u2013 revealing they relied on hundreds of outsourced Carillion workers to help run their businesses. Carillion directly employed around 20,000 workers, all of whose jobs are now under threat. However, that figure is dwarfed by those employed in the firm\u2019s supply chain, where as many as 30,000 small businesses are thought to be owed money. Andy Bradley, managing director of Cambridge-based landscaping company Flora-tec, said he has had to lay off 10 of his 90 workers because he is owed nearly \u00a31m by Carillion. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a profitable business but we can\u2019t trade out of a black hole of \u00a31m,\u201d he told the Guardian. Rudi Klein, chief executive of the Specialist Engineering Contractors\u2019 trade group, added: \u201cBanks are already starting to apply pressure on subcontractor firms that worked for Carillion. Banks are getting anxious and trying to find out companies\u2019 losses. \u201cIt\u2019s massive. This could be the last straw ... because Carillion took four months to pay, we are talking about big numbers [owed to subcontractors]. It is early days but there could be a potential disaster looming.\u201d Contractors were being paid 120 days after invoicing Carillion, but often have to pay their own workers on a weekly basis. One Carillion subcontractor, who did not want to be named but whose firm is owed a six-figure sum, said its bank manager had been in touch . The subcontractor said his lenders \u201cwill be concerned about our liquidity position\u201d. Another, working on the construction of Carillion\u2019s much-delayed project to build the new Royal Liverpool hospital, said: \u201cOur blue-collar staff have been sent home and are not being paid. A lot of the time the site worker is the most affected and it is them who can least afford it.\u201d Trade bodies urged the business secretary, Greg Clark, to ensure that firms affected by the collapse of Carillion receive maximum government and banking support. Paul Reeve, director of business at the lobby group Electrical Contractors\u2019 Association said: \u201cThe engineering specialist sector is the highest value sector in UK construction, and many specialists will be hit hard. The government and the banks must act to help protect public and private sector suppliers, who are the businesses the UK economy really needs.\u201d The comments raise the spectre of more taxpayer money being required to support sectors such as construction, which accounts for around 6% of UK national output, and they were reiterated by Lord Adonis, who said that \u201cthe Cabinet Office\u2019s own estimate of contingency costs\u201d from the Carillion collapse was \u00a3600m. Ministers have insisted that there will be no extra costs to the taxpayer stemming from Carillion\u2019s collapse, beyond the fees and indemnities necessary for the official receiver. Meanwhile, the impact on larger firms also started to emerge. The engineering firm Van Elle warned of a \u00a31.6m hit if it failed to claw back money owed by Carillion. The court documents suggest that at 1p in the \u00a31, the group will only get \u00a316,000 at most. The group, which worked with Carillion on several contracts to carry out rail improvement and maintenance work for Network Rail, highlighted a further \u00a32.5m of revenues linked to contracts with Carillion. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

They included:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The government telling the Insolvency Service to fast-track an investigation into the conduct of Carillion directors, and ordering a full investigation of the work done by the company\u2019s auditors, KPMG. The accountancy firm gave Carillion a clean bill of health last March.</li> \n <li>The revelation that Carillion had just \u00a329m in cash left when it collapsed, with two top accounting firms \u2013 PwC and EY \u2013 refusing to act as its administrators because they feared not being paid.</li> \n <li>Carillion\u2019s creditors being warned in court documents they are likely to receive less than 1p for every pound owed.</li> \n <li>A host of major British firms \u2013 including British Gas owner Centrica, Nationwide building society and Arriva Rail \u2013 revealing they relied on hundreds of outsourced Carillion workers to help run their businesses. </li> \n</ul> \n<p>Carillion directly employed around 20,000 workers, all of whose jobs are now under threat.

      "bodyText": "The Insolvency Service probably didn\u2019t need to be told how to do its job, but there is no harm in the business secretary, Greg Clark, telling it to \u201cfast-track\u201d its investigations into the actions of Carillion\u2019s directors and former directors. And, yes, it\u2019s often sensible to give the Financial Reporting Council a prod. The accountancy watchdog is not known for its electric speed and we would all like to know more about why the auditor KPMG gave Carillion a clean bill of health in March last year. But Clark may wish to dispatch his next letter to the Pensions Regulator, whose statements on Carillion read as extremely defensive. Try this: \u201cThe level of dividends paid compared to the level of payments to the schemes was better than the average for listed companies and was considered acceptable in the context of the group\u2019s reported profitability and trading strength at the time.\u201d That phrase \u201cconsidered acceptable\u201d requires explanation given that the deficit in the main funds was about \u00a3580m at last count. Carillion\u2019s accounts show that it made deficit recovery payments of \u00a347.4m in 2015 and \u00a346.6m in 2016. But the dividends to shareholders were higher \u2013 \u00a380m then \u00a382.7m. We are always told that the Pensions Regulator lives in the land of the possible, that squeezing companies too hard on dividends can be counter-productive and that striking the right balance is important. Even so, \u00a380m-ish in dividends and \u00a347m-ish for the pension scheme looks the wrong way around. Carillion was an acquisition-hungry company in an industry not unused to corporate collapses. \u201cWe are not prepared to comment further about our involvement unless it becomes appropriate to do so,\u201d concludes the regulator. Take that as your cue, Mr Clark. CBI is oddly quiet on Carillion collapse Naturally, business lobby groups have had lots to say about the biggest UK corporate collapse in years \u2013 well, most of them anyway. The Federation of Small Businesses was quick out of the traps to demand that Carillion\u2019s suppliers should be paid and that government contracts should not be a love-in with big business. The Institute of Directors did an effective job of damning the \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d pay awards to Carillion directors. And the CBI? The self-styled \u201cBritish business voice around the world\u201d has been oddly quiet. Director-general Carolyn Fairbairn hasn\u2019t drawn any public conclusions and all one can extract by way of official CBI statement is two anodyne sentences, the first of which just says \u201cthis is a sad time for Carillion, its staff, customers and suppliers\u201d. The lack of vigour is surprising from a pro-business organisation because there is a respectable pro-business argument to be made. The CBI could say, for example, that Carillion\u2019s demise shows that too much risk has been transferred to the private sector via private finance initiative (PFI) and outsourcing contracts. It could suggest that a more collaborative approach, with risks and rewards shared equitably, is the way to go. One might not agree with that argument \u2013 but it\u2019s the sort of thing one expects to hear from the CBI. Maybe Fairbairn is lobbying behind the scenes or will unveil her thinking next week in (inevitably) Davos. In the meantime, the hot news out of the CBI is that a \u201cfresh approach\u201d is needed to make skills reforms last. Perhaps it is \u2013 but it\u2019s not what everyone is talking about. Provident Financial in limbo \u201cOur priorities for 2018 are to rebuild trust with our customers, regulators, shareholders and employees,\u201d says Malcolm Le May, stand-in chairman of money-lender Provident Financial. Call that a full sweep on the rebuilding trust front, then. Customers walked away in droves when Provident botched its attempt to turn its self-employed doorstep agents into full-time \u201ccustomer experience managers\u201d. Staff were obviously annoyed by the same calamity. As for the regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is plainly doing a thorough job on Provident, investigating both its Moneybarn car finance arm and credit card operation Vanquis. As for the shareholders, they will be furious about the 75% fall in the share price since last spring. Unfortunately for Le May, it\u2019s hard to find anything in the latest update that one could call progress. The loss in the consumer credit business after the doorstep debacle will be about \u00a3120m, as bad as feared last August. Meanwhile, supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s is yanking its partnership with Vanquis and bringing its Argos card in-house. Provident\u2019s shares, even at the shrunken price \u2013 down 13% on Tuesday \u2013 look to be an outright gamble on the FCA\u2019s findings. If the regulator decides Vanquis\u2019s controversial \u201crepayment option plan\u201d \u2013 a way for borrowers to freeze their debts \u2013 was a nasty product that was sold unfairly, there could be heavy redress to pay.

      "bodyText": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average has topped the 26,000 mark for the first time, a new landmark in the Wall Street stock market boom that has gathered pace since the new year. The leading index of US shares has risen 1,000 points in just 12 days \u2013 and six stock market trading sessions, given that Wall Street was closed for Martin Luther King Jr Day on Monday \u2013 fuelled by an upswing in the global economy and the prospect of bumper company earnings thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts. The Dow added almost 280 points in early trading in New York, hitting a high of 26,081 before falling back below the 26,000 mark towards lunchtime. The biggest gains were for pharmaceutical company Merck &amp; Co, health insurer United Health and digger manufacturer Caterpillar. The Dow took 19 trading sessions to rise from 24,000 to 25,000 on 4 January and is up more than 40% since Trump\u2019s election in November 2016. Sceptics have dubbed the latest phase of the bull market a \u201cmelt-up\u201d, with US shares continuing to rise despite looking overpriced by traditional yardsticks, and warn it could be a last hurrah before a downward correction or crash. However, the US economy is currently going through one of its longest-ever periods of expansion, only surpassed by the booms that took place in the 1960s and the 1990s before the dotcom crash. The US has now been growing without a correction since June 2009, following the recession that followed the financial crisis. Inflation and interest rates have remained low around the world, helping to fuel the stock market boom, as the biggest countries\u2019 central banks pump billions into their economies through quantitative easing. In the UK, the FTSE 100 dropped by about 13 points to 7,755.93, as European shares dipped slightly after strong gains in recent weeks. However, Bitcoin slid as much as 18% on Tuesday to a four-week low, leaving it just above $11,000 amid fresh fears of a regulatory crackdown. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The collapse of Carillion has increased scrutiny of government ties to private contractors. Work carried out by major outsourcing firms, such as Serco and G4S, includes maintaining railways and running immigration detention centres. Here is a financial summary of the remaining big players. Serco The firm\u2019s involvement in the public sector includes running the Yarl\u2019s Wood immigration detention centre, the London bicycle scheme, Mersey Rail and managing the Atomics Weapons Establishment. Of its \u00a33bn turnover, around \u00a3750m comes from central government contracts. Serco has minimal direct exposure to Carillion through joint ventures, but last year it agreed to buy some facilities management contracts for the NHS from Carillion in a \u00a347.7m deal. This deal was due to be completed by the end of 2018. Dscussions are continuing about the deal\u2019s future after Carillion\u2019s collapse. Shares in the company, now run by Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson Rupert Soames, fell by 31% last year amid the restructuring that followed a number of profit warnings. Serco was also investigated by the Serious Fraud office after billing the government in 2013 for the electronic monitoring of criminals who were either behind bars or dead. The revelation led to a temporary government ban on awarding state contracts. Serco shares have recovered on signs of a turnaround and a reduction in its net debt to around \u00a3200m, down from nearly \u00a3700m in 2014. G4S The security and cash handling business also has little exposure to Carilion. Its public sector work \u2013 which includes running prisons and security for the Department of Work and Pensions \u2013 accounts for just 5% of its total revenues of \u00a37.5bn. Less than 20% of its business is in the UK. It has debts of \u00a31.6bn, compared with a market capitalisation of \u00a34.5bn G4S has run into controversy several times, with a Serious Fraud office investigation into overcharging, as well as allegations of abuse at the Brook House immigration centre. Like Serco, it was temporarily barred from government contracts after the overcharging claims, after which it had to repay \u00a3109m and agree to a corporate renewal programme. Its shares have recovered from a low point in 2015 although they dipped last year after it warned of slower than expected growth in 2018. Balfour Beatty Balfour Beatty has three joint ventures with Carillion, and will take a hit of between \u00a335m and \u00a345m as Carillion\u2019s share of the projects are redistributed. The bulk of the cost is related to the \u00a3550m Aberdeen Western Peripheral route. Its other public sector contracts include work for Network Rail, HS2 and Highways England. It has 16,000 UK employees and around 36% of its \u00a36.9bn in revenue comes from the UK. Its net debt totals \u00a3232m. After a torrid two-year period from 2014, when it issued seven profit warnings and its shares plunged 75% over 12 months, the company returned to profit in 2016. Kier Kier operated joint ventures with Carillion on the HS2 rail programme and the Highways England smart motorways programme. It has put in place contingency plans which are expected to involve transferring Carillion staff to Kier and the French engineering company Eiffage, the other partner on HS2. UK public sector work accounts for around half of Kier\u2019s \u00a34bn turnover, including contracting work on Crossrail and running hospital and local authority services. It typically has a large number of small-sized contracts with an average-sized value of about \u00a310m. It has 19,000 UK employees and net debt of \u00a3110m. Capita About half of Capita\u2019s annual turnover of \u00a34.9bn comes from central and local government work, ranging from administering the teachers\u2019 pension scheme to providing tech services to the NHS, electronic monitoring services and running the Gas Safe register for the Health and Safety Executive. It has around 50,000 UK employees, and a net debt of \u00a31.6bn compared with its market value of \u00a32.8bn. The company\u2019s shares have lost two-thirds of their value over the past two years after a series of profit warnings and boardroom changes. Mitie Mitie has a limited number of government contracts, and no exposure to Carillion although like others, it will be looking closely at what may happen to the collapsed company\u2019s business. Mitie has 53,000 full- and part-time UK employees, and around \u00a3200m of debt. It runs an immigrant detention centre at Heathrow, manages juvenile centres, runs social housing services and repaired the roof at the Palace of Westminster. Around 25% of its \u00a32bn in revenue relates to central and local government contracts. However, its activities are overshadowed by a series of investigations into how its 2015 financial statements were prepared and approved, with the latest inquiry announced in November. The company had issued a series of profit warnings, dragged down by rising labour costs and the fallout from taking on low-margin contracts. It is currently in the middle of a restructuring. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The collapse of the construction giant Carillion, which has put thousands of jobs and numerous projects at risk, was shocking, but not entirely surprising. Some hedge fund managers were so sure the company\u2019s problems were mounting they gambled on the share price plunging and made millions. The warning signs they were watching included: 1. Profit warnings Three profit warnings in five months gave the clearest and most public signal that Carillion was in serious trouble. The first came on 10 July when the company shocked the market with a \u00a3845m writedown on contract values and the chief executive, Richard Howson, stepped down. A second warning came in September, and a third in November as its financial woes deepened. Carillion shares plunged from 192p before the first warning to just 14p on Friday, the last day of trading. 2. Short-selling Hedge funds and other financial speculators had been shorting Carillion shares, betting the firm would hit trouble, even before the profit warnings. Short-sellers borrow the shares from other investors in return for a fee. They then sell the shares in the belief they will be able to buy them back cheaper in future. If it works, they make a profit and return the shares to the original investor. At one point last summer, 25% of Carillion\u2019s shares were shorted. Among the short-sellers were BlackRock, whose advisers include the former chancellor George Osborne, Italian-run Kairos and SFM UK, a fund linked to the billionaire financier George Soros. 3. Mounting debts and pension deficit Spiralling debts and a huge pension deficit signalled the extent of the problems and ultimately proved Carillion\u2019s downfall. The company\u2019s debts soared by more than 50% to \u00a3900m between September and its collapse this week and it had a pension black hole of about \u00a3580m \u2013 although experts expect the final figure to be higher. 4. Delaying payments to subcontractors The Federation of Small Businesses wrote to the company in July after suppliers complained to the trade body that they were being made to wait 120 days to be paid, double generally accepted 60-day maximum. It is thought Carillion owes money to about 30,000 small firms. 5. Complex financing arrangements Carillion was using increasingly unusual methods to secure finance \u2013 a sign it was struggling to access more traditional sources, from banks and standard bonds. The company had raised \u00a3112m through a Schuldschein bond, a market that requires less public disclosure of financial detail. It had also reportedly turned to \u201creverse factoring\u201d where, for a fee, banks paid Carillion\u2019s suppliers, allowing the company to settle up later. 6. The cracks were visible One of Carillion\u2019s most problematic contracts was the construction of the Royal Liverpool university hospital. The project was delayed after workers found \u201cextensive\u201d asbestos on site and cracks in concrete beams. Originally slated to open in March last year, the hospital remains unfinished. It was one of the central issues identified in the first profit warning. Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "You report that Carillion has a pensions deficit of \u00a3600m (Scramble to save jobs as Carillion crisis deepens, 16 January). How is it possible for companies to allow this to happen? It not only causes members of the pension schemes to lose the value of their savings, but results in the pensions lifeboat fund having to cover the parent company\u2019s failure to discharge its responsibilities to fund the pension scheme. Why are companies that mismanage their pension funds in this way not only allowed to do this, but also awarded government contracts? Why not simply rule out any company with a significant deficit from being allowed to bid for government contracts? It also highlights how little has changed since Robert Maxwell in the way companies like Carillion today and BHS under Philip Green are still able to ruin workers\u2019 lives by failing to provide the promised pensions. Companies cannot arbitrarily reduce workers\u2019 pay, but it appears they are able to fail to fund their pensions as a contractual benefit. Company pensions should be much more clearly separated from the parent company and tighter actuarial control applied to avoid deficits which are inexcusable. Ian Reissmann Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire \u2022 In 1988 I was a member of the team that wrote the specifications and assessed the tenders for the first large, outsourced, training contract awarded by the MoD. I then spent the next year monitoring in detail the contractor\u2019s adherence to a large part of the contract. The original team warned at the time that major outsourcing would eventually lead to a lack of in-house expertise that government departments would need to be the \u201cintelligent customer\u201d when the time came to renew contracts. If an in-house capability was not maintained as a benchmark, then the contractors would become a self-perpetuating group whose costings and standards could not be challenged. It has taken longer than I expected for Carillion to fulfil our prediction. David Bowman Romsey, Hampshire \u2022 Are we surprised that Carillon has collapsed? A leading construction journal reported in August 2017 that the profit margin of the top 10 UK contractors averaged -5%. That\u2019s negative profit. Contractors operate like banks: they take early payment from their clients and invest the money while paying their sub-contractors and suppliers as late as possible. Hence the fragile state of the industry and the number of companies in this sector that are put into liquidation every year. Construction contributes 7% of the UK GDP and provides 10% of the employment (more than 3m jobs), and with 25% of the output in the public sector we are reliant on a healthy industry. The consequences of this current failure indicate the need for government to be more closely involved with these large private sector companies if further insolvencies are to be avoided. John Brimley Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire \u2022 The government has been trumpeting its code that requires large companies to treat their suppliers fairly and pay them on the same terms as the government pays the big companies. Instead it has emerged that Carillion used its suppliers as a bank \u2013 refusing to pay them except on 120-day terms, while being paid on 30-day terms by the government. For the officials and ministers in so many departments to have turned a blind eye to this bullying by Carillion is a disgrace and it is surely time that both officials and ministers in transport, defence, health, education and elsewhere are held accountable for this total failure. If ministers weren\u2019t aware of this, the officials should be subject to disciplinary procedures. Paul Davies Goring, Oxfordshire \u2022 Simon Goodley (The four contracts that finished Carillion, 16 January) gives a helpfully clear account of the structure of major PPP construction deals: they\u2019re giant Ponzi schemes. Pam Lunn Kenilworth, Warwickshire \u2022 If the directors of Carillion paid themselves large salaries and bonuses and authorised the payment of dividends when they knew the company was in financial trouble, couldn\u2019t they and shouldn\u2019t they be charged with breach of their fiduciary duty? Kenneth Atkin London \u2022 The failure of Carillion illustrates what we have known for some time \u2013 that when private companies deliver public services they privatise the profit and socialise the risk. For obvious reasons the government cannot simply allow the public sector contracts to fail. The answer is to take these contracts back in house and recognise outsourcing for what it is \u2013 an unaccountable, expensive and risky way of delivering vital public services. Dr Jacky Davis (Founder member, Keep Our NHS Public), London \u2022 In the midst of the commentary about Carillion we are told that the chief executive earned \u00a31.5m in pay and bonuses in 2016. Would it not be more accurate when reporting these seven-digit sums to say not that they were \u201cearned\u201d, but that the recipients were \u201cpaid\u201d?

Its managing director, Andy Bradley, said he had to make 10 people redundant \u2013 out of 90 \u2013 on Monday after Carillion went into liquidation. He was told by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accountants handling the liquidation together with the official receiver, that Flora-tec would be paid only for work done since then. Flora-tec is owed \u00a31m (\u00a3800,000 plus VAT) \u2013 more than 10% of its annual turnover \u2013 by Carillion for gritting and snow-clearing work carried out at schools, hospitals, prisons and courts in the past two months. Flora-tec was due to be paid for the work next week. His staff were up at 3am during last month\u2019s cold spell, clearing snow and putting salt down. Carillion\u2019s collapse could not have happened at a worse time, Bradley said. \u201cWe are not going to see a cent of that money.\u201d He warned that the business was unlikely to survive and many other small firms would go under unless the government set up an emergency fund. \u201cI\u2019m not asking for charity, I\u2019m asking for time,\u201d he said. Bradley added: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a profitable business, but we can\u2019t trade out of a black hole of \u00a31m \u2026 I set up the business 20 years ago from nothing and now it\u2019s going to go back to nothing.\u201d The former seeds trials manager set up Flora-tec as part of Unwins seed company and led a management buyout of the business in 2007. He said he felt \u201cduped and betrayed\u201d by the government, which had been handing Carillion new contracts despite the company issuing two profit warnings last summer. \u201cThe government actively encouraged SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] like us to get involved in public sector contracts. Carillion then put out a profit warning last summer. Normally I would go: \u2018I need to reduce my exposure to this business\u2019. But the government awarded them billions of pounds\u2019 worth of contracts. What message is that sending to SMEs? It\u2019s saying to me: the government has done its due diligence and has confidence in Carillion.\u201d He added: \u201cThe government should hang its head in shame.

    "webTitle": "Qantas worst airline operating across Pacific for CO2 emissions, analysis reveals", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Qantas emits more carbon dioxide per passenger-kilometre than any other airline operating across the Pacific, according to an analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation, the group that exposed the Volkswagen emissions scandal in 2014. For each kilometre Qantas transports a passenger across the Pacific, it uses 64% more fuel than the two most fuel-efficient airlines operating across the Pacific: Hainan Airlines and All Nippon Airways (ANA). One litre of aviation fuel was able to transport one passenger just 22km, on average, on Qantas flights, while Hainan and ANA were able to take a passenger 36km on 1L of fuel. The wide variation between airlines provides a stark contrast to the industry\u2019s aspirational goal of improving fuel efficiency of international flights by just 2% annually. Aviation currently accounts for about 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions. But pollution from the industry is expected to increase and, by 2050, use up a quarter of the allowable greenhouse gas emissions if the world is to keep global warming at less than 1.5C \u2013 the world\u2019s \u201ccarbon budget\u201d. While Hainan and ANA tied as the most fuel-efficient airlines, they used different strategies to achieve the relatively low fuel burn. Hainan Airways, a Chinese carrier, employed more fuel-efficient aircraft, using the Boeing 787 Dreamliner for more than 80% of its flights, and the Airbus A330 for the remainder. It also avoided having excessive empty seats, further increasing its efficiency. Meanwhile, the Japanese airline ANA achieved the low fuel-burn by carrying a lot of cargo, which the analysis treated as equivalent to carrying people. In contrast, Qantas used the two most fuel-intensive aircraft \u2013 Airbus A380 and Boeing 747-400ER \u2013 and carried the most empty seats of any transpacific airline, filling just 74% of its seats. Comparing all the airlines, ICCT found that how much freight an airline carried was the strongest determinant of its fuel efficiency, explaining 48% of the variation between airlines. Seating density, aircraft efficiency and passenger load were the other major factors. Looking at specific routes, the analysis found Delta was the most fuel-efficient airline on the Sydney-Los Angeles route, flying a passenger 33km on a litre of fuel. Virgin Australia and United were not far behind on 32km, while Qantas lagged on just 24km. The most competitive transpacific route was Los Angeles-Tokyo, with six airlines flying between the two hubs. On that route United was the most fuel-efficient, taking a passenger 42km on a litre of fuel. Singapore Airlines was the least fuel-efficient, taking a passenger just 26km on a litre of fuel. The report notes that Qantas is planning on using eight new Dreamliners for flights to the US, which, if operating now, would lift the airline one place from the bottom, above Korean Air and tying with Asiana in the second-bottom place. The results follow an earlier analysis ICCT conducted on the efficiency of airlines on transatlantic routes in 2015, which found a significant but smaller variation between airlines than was found on Pacific routes. In that report, British Airways and Lufthansa were found to have emitted 51% more carbon dioxide than the cleanest flyers, Norwegian Air. \u201cThis research shows that there are a variety of ways that international airlines can reduce fuel use and carbon emissions,\u201d said Brandon Graver from ICCT, the lead author of the study. \u201cBuying new aircraft, carrying large numbers of passengers and optimising freight strategies all make a difference.\u201d Dan Rutherford, ICCT\u2019s aviation program director and co-author of the paper, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a reason airlines around the world are starting to avoid very large aircraft like the 747 and A380. \u201cNewer twin-engine widebodies provide the payload and range capabilities needed for transpacific flights with much lower fuel burn.\u201d Alan Milne, head of fuel and environment at Qantas told the Guardian that the airline ranks low in the analysis because it uses large aircraft, flies long distances and has premium cabins that leave more space between passengers. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to reducing carbon emissions and continually look at ways to lower them across our operations,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are switching our 747s for more fuel-efficient Dreamliners and we have several data-driven programs in place to reduce fuel burn.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Greggs is looking to take a bite out of McDonald\u2019s and Burger King\u2019s evening trade with a new fast-food menu that includes chicken goujons, potato wedges and pasta dishes. The Newcastle baker, famous for its sausage rolls and steak bakes, is broadening its takeaway menu as Britons spend more of their food budgets on eating out. The Greggs chief executive, Roger Whiteside, said it had already taken on fast-food rivals at breakfast and lunchtimes and now sees scope to become a destination for evening meals too. \u201cWe are testing a menu that will appeal in the evening, which is the part of the day when Greggs doesn\u2019t trade,\u201d he explained. The chain has already expanded its repertoire to include gluten-free soup, low-calorie wraps and speciality coffees, such as its new caramel latte, and is working on vegan options. \u201cHot food is the last of the big food trends we have chosen to pursue,\u201d said Whiteside. Greggs has installed hot food cabinets in 100 stores and if the menu is well received Whiteside said it could extend its trading hours into the evening, when burger chains and convenience stores cash in on office workers heading home or out for the evening. \u201cWe need to find out if we can we sell hot food at the times we are already open.\u201d The update came as Greggs reported like-for-like sales growth of 3% over the Christmas quarter as shoppers topped up on festive bakes and mince pies. Its shares rose by 2%, described by analysts as a solid performance. After strong results in 2017, the retailer said it would step up expansion this year with plans to add 130 sites to its 1,850-store network. It is also looking to open drive-through shops around the country. The weakness of sterling as well as spikes in the cost of key ingredients such as meat and butter, forced Greggs to raise the price of its sausage rolls by 5p to 90p in 2017. Whiteside said it expected cost pressures to continue, albeit at a lower level. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The government has asked the Insolvency Service to fast-track an investigation into the conduct of the directors who ran Carillion, the outsourcing firm with scores of government contracts that went into compulsory liquidation on Monday. The move came as politicians and unions held a series of emergency sessions to discuss the collapse, which has put 20,000 UK jobs at risk. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said: \u201cIt is important we quickly get the full picture of the events which caused Carillion to enter liquidation, which is why I have asked the Insolvency Service to fast-track and broaden the scope of the Official Receiver\u2019s investigation. \u201cIn particular, I have asked that the investigation looks not only at the conduct of the directors at the point of its insolvency, but also of any individuals who were previously directors. Any evidence of misconduct will be taken very seriously.\u201d The announcement came as Theresa May told her cabinet that the \u201ctaxpayer could not be expected to bail out a private company\u201d following the collapse of Carillion, according to her official spokesman. The prime minister addressed the issue at the start of a meeting of her top team, arguing that a lot of work had gone into trying to find suitable financing options but that had not proved possible. The spokesman made clear that in the short term the government would ensure that public services carried on operating, but that was simply replicating money that would have gone to the company \u2013 rather than pushing up the bill for taxpayers. They admitted that public money would have to go to paying the receiver. However, a Whitehall source denied the suggestion that the money could run into the hundreds of millions, saying \u201cit will be nowhere near that\u201d. The moves came as an emergency meeting of the six main unions, whose members are caught up in the collapse, was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon to gauge the number of job losses. The meeting, called by the TUC, will involve the general unions Unite and GMB, the public service unions Unison and PCS, the transport specialists the RMT, and Prospect, whose members include scientists, engineers and managers. Meanwhile, government ministers met at Downing Street to discuss the fallout from the collapse amid mounting criticism of their handling of the construction and outsourcing giant\u2019s demise. The debt-laden company had 450 government contracts, ranging from the HS2 high-speed railway to providing school lunches and maintaining 50,000 homes on military bases, and employed 43,000 people, including 19,500 in the UK. Ministers are facing questions about how much the liquidation will cost taxpayers. The cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning followed an emergency meeting of ministers on Monday night. Further jobs are under threat in the supply chain, with as many as 30,000 small firms owed money by Carillion. Andy Bradley, the managing director of the garden and winter services company Flora-tec, said Carillion owed it almost \u00a31m for gritting and snow-clearing work carried out in November and December at schools, hospitals, prisons and courts. He said the accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is helping handle the liquidation, told him Flora-tec would be paid only for services carried out since Monday. He had since laid off 10 of his 90 workers and said the firm was unlikely to survive unless the government stepped in with an emergency fund. Bradley told the Guardian: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a profitable business but we can\u2019t trade out of a black hole of \u00a31m.\u201d He said he felt \u201cduped and betrayed\u201d by the government, which had been awarding Carillion new contracts despite the company issuing two profit warnings last summer. \u201cThis sent out the message that Carillion was sound.\u201d The engineering firm Van Elle warned of a \u00a31.6m hit if it failed to claw back money owed by Carillion. The group, which worked with Carillion on several contracts to carry out rail improvement and maintenance work for Network Rail, highlighted a further \u00a32.5m of revenues linked to contracts with Carillion. A FTSE 250 company, John Laing Infrastructure Fund, said it was rolling nine Carillion projects on to new providers. The TUC has called for the government to assemble a national taskforce to deal with the crisis. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary, said: \u201cWe urgently need a national taskforce involving unions to safeguard jobs, services, and pensions. \u201cWorkers can\u2019t be left at the back of the queue. Each and every worker at Carillion needs to know where they stand. They have bills and mortgages to pay, and deserve certainty on their future. \u201cAnd we have to ensure that there aren\u2019t more Carillions on the horizon. That means an immediate risk assessment of all large outsourcing firms with government contracts. Public services are already under pressure, and can\u2019t take another hit like this.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Doorstep lender Provident Financial expects to post a \u00a3120m loss at its consumer credit business after struggling to win back customers following a botched reorganisation of the 130-year-old business last year. The company, which specialises in lending to people in financial difficulty, blamed a \u201clower than expected rate of reconnection\u201d in the fourth quarter. The shares fell 5% in early trading on Tuesday and were later down 3.8% at 885p. The reorganisation, which involved replacing 4,500 self-employed collection agents with 2,500 full-time \u201ccustomer experience managers\u201d (CEMs) resulted in two profit warnings last summer, a share price plunge and the departure of the chief executive. The CEMs were given iPads but were sent to the wrong addresses, or the correct addresses at the wrong time, and were unable to make sales or collect payments. The firm decided to hire collection agents again in October after axing them earlier in the year. Provident warned in August that the door-to-door lending operation would lose between \u00a380m and \u00a3120m in 2017. It noted on Tuesday that debt collection rates had improved and customer numbers at the division went up to 530,000 from 500,000 in September. The firm plans to reduce costs by cutting support jobs. This is thought to affect tens of jobs rather than hundreds. Provident\u2019s credit card business, Vanquis Bank, and its car finance division, Moneybarn, are under investigation by the financial watchdog. The Canaccord analyst Bill Barnard said: \u201cWhile we would regard Provident\u2019s trading update as positive on a go-forward basis \u2013 there is more of a home credit business than we thought there might be \u2013 there are still a number of bridges to be crossed.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "State-of the-art electric taxis that London\u2019s transport authorities hope will replace diesel black cabs have yet to enter service on the streets of the capital \u2013 because the meter does not work. Only one zero-emission taxi has so far been licensed in the capital with none yet to carry a paying passenger \u2013 two weeks after rules came into force banning any other new black cabs. From the start of 2018 London has only permitted zero-emission capable vehicles to join its fleet of 23,000 cabs. The only approved model so far is the London Electric Vehicle Company\u2019s TX eCity. However, no electric TXs are yet in commercial operation, despite lavish praise for the new taxi from test drivers and great hopes invested in its potential to reduce air pollution. Several hundred of the British-built vehicles have been ordered, according to the Coventry-based, Chinese-owned manufacturer. However, the taxis will not be delivered to drivers for several weeks while the meter glitch is resolved with LEVC\u2019s supplier. The electric vehicle gives out a regular pulse to tell how far it has travelled. A spokesman said: \u201cThe signal from the vehicles and the meters are not lining up and we are working on a solution to fix that issue. We\u2019re working to get an appropriate converter to get the vehicles licensed by [Transport for London] and over to customers.\u201d Take-up of the TX eCity has proved slow. Drivers have called on the government and TfL to make it more attractive to buy the taxi, which costs about \u00a310,000 more than diesel models, although running costs are substantially lower. Concerns over sufficient charging points, as well as a tax change that means an extra \u00a31,550 excise duty is paid by early adopters, are seen as a deterrent. Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association, said the TX is \u201ca fantastic vehicle. It is state of the art. We\u2019d have gone from a 1950s Ford Anglia to a Tesla overnight with this. And we could be leading the charge in persuading the rest of London to be electric, clean and green.\u201d However, he added: \u201cAt the moment people are very hesitant. We\u2019ve got to pay \u00a312k more for a vehicle that we don\u2019t know the reliability or durability of, at a time when the market is being squeezed by that company [Uber].\u201d The taxi costs \u00a355,600, after a \u00a37,500 electric vehicle grant, or can be leased for five years at \u00a3177 a week, around \u00a310 more than diesel models \u2013 although LEVC says that drivers would save up to \u00a3100 per week on fuel. A luxury car tax introduced in 2017 means buyers face a \u00a3310 annual increase in road tax for five years. Although the chancellor has since granted taxis an exemption, it will only take effect for purchases made from April 2019. McNamara added: \u201cThe lack of charging infrastructure is a concern. There are still nowhere near the number of rapid charge points that we need in central London.\u201d The back-up of a petrol engine extends the taxi\u2019s range to 377 miles, more than diesel, but drivers may not be able to complete a shift and return journey home on the battery\u2019s 80 mile range without a recharge. Only 90 rapid charge points exist in the capital, the majority in outer zones. TfL has pledged 300 rapid charging points will be in operation by the end of 2020, many dedicated to taxis, while London boroughs have been given \u00a34.5m to double the 2,000 slow charging points on residential streets. Many councils have been reluctant to install charge points, which take up valuable parking spaces and can be regarded as unsightly. Transport ministers on Tuesday urged councils around the UK to do more, after it emerged that millions in government grants had been unclaimed and only five councils had installed chargers under the national funding scheme. Despite teething problems, TfL hopes that 9,000 London cabs will be zero-emission by 2020. The TX completely eliminates NOx emissions, and even when running its petrol back-up cuts CO2 emissions to an eighth of those from the latest diesel taxi. For London\u2019s residents, passengers and cab drivers, the taxi can\u2019t come soon enough. It even promises the social revolution of happier taxi drivers. John Dowd, a London cabbie for 10 years, who has been roadtesting the TX for LEVC since September, said he returns home a more chilled-out person now: \u201cYou don\u2019t have the drone of engine all day. It\u2019s much less stressful to drive, a much nicer vehicle and it\u2019s green \u2013 a different world.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "webTitle": "UK green energy investment halves after policy changes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Investment in clean energy plunged further in Britain than in any other country last year because of government policy changes, new figures show. The amount companies spent on green energy in the UK rose during the years of the coalition government (2010-2015) but has now fallen for two years in a row under the Conservatives, according to analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). While investment in wind, solar and other renewable sources slumped by 56% to $10.3bn (\u00a37.5bn) in the UK, worldwide spending climbed 3% to $333.5bn (\u00a3242.4bn), the second-highest level on record. Alan Whitehead, shadow energy minister, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s green rhetoric is nothing more than empty promises. Their ideologically-driven policy lurches away from clean solar power and onshore wind has spooked investors. \u201cWhilst saying they have ambitions to be a green government their actions point in the opposite direction with renewables support slashed at the same time that fracking has been given the go ahead.\u201d Caroline Lucas, Green party co-leader, said the UK figures were damning. China led the global charge, with investment jumping by nearly a quarter to $132.6bn, a new high. The amount of solar installed in China increased by more than three-quarters on the year before as costs fell. Worldwide, solar took the lion\u2019s share of spending on renewables, at $160.8bn, followed by windfarms. Jon Moore, chief executive of BNEF, said: \u201cThe 2017 total is all the more remarkable when you consider that capital costs for the leading technology \u2013 solar \u2013 continue to fall sharply.\u201d Investment increased by 1% to $56.9bn in the US, the second-biggest market for clean technologies, despite the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to favour coal and nuclear power. However, spending also fell in Germany, Japan, India, Norway, Turkey and Taiwan. The fall of 56% in the UK was the steepest decline, far out-stripping the decrease of 26% for Europe as a whole. Around half of the UK spend, $4.8bn, was a final investment decision by \u00d8rsted of Denmark on a single huge offshore windfarm, the Hornsea 2 project off the Yorkshire coast. Another big green energy firm, npower\u2019s parent company, Innogy, said the UK was still an attractive place to invest, but there had been a stop-start approach to support from government. Paul Cowling, director of wind energy offshore at Innogy SE, said: \u201cIt\u2019s just very lumpy. You have this very sort of cyclic type of approach that government have had in the past.\u201d The German firm is planning to spend \u20ac3.5bn (\u00a33.1bn) on renewables over the next three years, with the UK billed as the company\u2019s second-biggest market. Cowling confirmed that the company would be competing for a slice of the \u00a3557m pot of government subsidies for offshore windfarms that will be auctioned next year. BNEF said that while the promise of future subsidies showed the government was behind the sector, it agreed with Innogy on the need for greater clarity on what ministers want over the next decade. \u201cWhat\u2019s needed when we hear from investors and developers is more transparency from the government. When you compare the Netherlands and Germany there\u2019s more transparency up to 2030 on [wind power] capacity through competitive auctions,\u201d said Keegan Kruger, wind analyst at BNEF. Kruger added that he expected the trend in UK investment to continue downwards until around 2020, when it would likely stabilise because of new investments in offshore windfarms. As well as solar parks and windfarms, the BNEF analysis counts clean technology investments as including smart grids, energy efficiency and battery storage projects. It also includes biomass, waste-to-energy schemes, marine energy and small hydro projects but excludes large dams. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK has reduced emissions on a per person basis faster than any other G7 nation and the government is committed to a low carbon future for the UK with clean growth at the heart of our industrial strategy.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Their ideologically-driven policy lurches away from clean solar power and onshore wind has spooked investors.</p> <p>\u201cWhilst saying they have ambitions to be a green government their actions point in the opposite direction with renewables support slashed at the same time that fracking has been given the go ahead.\u201d<br></p> <p>Caroline Lucas, Green party co-leader, said the UK figures were damning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2018-01-16T12:00:44/embed.html\" data-alt=\"UK clean energy spending graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2018-01-16T12:00:44/embed.html\">UK clean energy spending graph</a> </figure>  <p>China led the global charge, with investment jumping by nearly a quarter to $132.6bn, a new high.

The fall of 56% in the UK was the steepest decline, far out-stripping the decrease of 26% for Europe as a whole.</p> <p>Around half of the UK spend, $4.8bn, was a final investment decision by \u00d8rsted of Denmark on a single huge offshore windfarm, the Hornsea 2 project off the Yorkshire coast.</p> <p>Another big green energy firm, npower\u2019s parent company, Innogy, said the UK was still an attractive place to invest, but there had been a stop-start approach to support from government.</p> <p>Paul Cowling, director of wind energy offshore at Innogy SE, said: \u201cIt\u2019s just very lumpy. You have this very sort of cyclic type of approach that government have had in the past.\u201d </p> <p>The German firm is planning to spend \u20ac3.5bn (\u00a33.1bn) on renewables over the next three years, with the UK billed as the company\u2019s second-biggest market. </p> <p>Cowling confirmed that the company would be competing for a slice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/12/uk-puts-energy-efficiency-at-heart-of-climate-change-strategy\">the \u00a3557m pot of government subsidies</a> for offshore windfarms that will be auctioned next year.</p> <p>BNEF said that while the promise of future subsidies showed the government was behind the sector, it agreed with Innogy on the need for greater clarity on what ministers want over the next decade.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s needed when we hear from investors and developers is more transparency from the government. When you compare the Netherlands and Germany there\u2019s more transparency up to 2030 on [wind power] capacity through competitive auctions,\u201d said Keegan Kruger, wind analyst at BNEF.</p> <p>Kruger added that he expected the trend in UK investment to continue downwards until around 2020, when it would likely stabilise because of new investments in offshore windfarms. </p> <p>As well as solar parks and windfarms, the BNEF analysis counts clean technology investments as including smart grids, energy efficiency and battery storage projects. It also includes biomass, waste-to-energy schemes, marine energy and small hydro projects but excludes large dams.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK has reduced emissions on a per person basis faster than any other G7 nation and the government is committed to a low carbon future for the UK with clean growth at the heart of our industrial strategy.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The squeeze on British household budgets showed signs of easing in December as the rate of inflation fell for the first time in six months, helped by lower airfare costs and a fall in the price of games and toys. The consumer price index fell to 3% last month from a five-year high of 3.1% in November, raising the prospect that inflation may have peaked, easing some of the pressure on UK consumers. Economists had expected the rate to moderate as the effects from the fall in sterling since the Brexit vote \u2013 which pushed up the cost of importing food and fuel \u2013 begin to wash out of the system. The Office for National Statistics said the slowing rate of growth was offset partially by higher tobacco prices, reflecting the duty increases that came into effect following the budget, as well as a rise in petrol and diesel prices. Inflation remains at its highest level since April 2012, having risen relatively steadily since the EU referendum, when the consumer prices index (CPI) was at 0.5%. The squeeze on living standards has proved a key political flashpoint, used by the Labour party as evidence of the Conservatives\u2019 economic failure. Peter Dowd, Labour\u2019s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the inflation figures were \u201cfurther bad news for working households\u201d, adding that real pay is still lower now than it was in 2010. The Treasury said it was \u201chelping families with their everyday costs of living\u201d by cutting tax bills, freezing fuel and alcohol duties, and raising the minimum wage. December\u2019s fall in inflation will be closely watched by the Bank of England, which has previously said it expected the CPI to peak in the final months of 2017 before falling back to about 2.4% at the end of this year. That would be above its 2% target rate, which it said was justification for raising interest rates even as inflation fades. However, statisticians at the ONS said it could be too early to tell if the drop last month was the start of any longer-term reduction in the rate of inflation. British households are also still coming under pressure from weak wage growth, which stood at 2.3% in the three months to October, and could remain below the rate of inflation this year. Although the Bank may still look to raise interest rates from 0.5%, pushing the cost of borrowing to levels unseen since before the financial crisis, economists said there were still difficult patches ahead for the economy, which may be unsettled by the Brexit negotiations. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the best option was therefore \u201ca prolonged period of monetary stability, to keep interest rates steady over the near term\u201d. Although the CPI fell last month, the alternative retail prices index measure of inflation, which includes mortgage interest payments and house prices, rose to 4.1% last month from 3.9% in November, reflecting the higher cost of borrowing after the Bank raised interest rates for the first time in a decade. The ONS said house prices in the UK increased by 5.1% during the year to the end of November, with the average value of a home going up by \u00a311,000 over the course of the year to stand at \u00a3226,000. The most expensive place to live in the country was Kensington and Chelsea, where the average cost of a home was \u00a31.3m, while the cheapest was Burnley, where an average house cost \u00a379,000. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The government has been criticised by MPs for being slow to overhaul a \u201cflawed and poorly resourced\u201d safety regime for electrical white goods that has allowed 1m potentially dangerous tumble dryers to be in use in homes across the UK. The business, energy and industrial strategy select committee is also urging manufacturer Whirlpool to repair faulty machines within two weeks of being contacted by owners, or explain what action it plans to take to deal with the problem. MPs on the committee say it is unacceptable that there are still 1m defective Whirlpool tumble dryers in homes more than two years after the discovery of a fault that has resulted in at least 750 domestic fires in the UK since 2004. The company is still mired in controversy over its decision not to recall items that are at risk of bursting into flames. The committee says Whirlpool\u2019s \u201cinadequate response\u201d to the defect highlights the flaws in the UK\u2019s safety regime, adding that serious consideration must now be given by the government to establishing a single national product safety agency. It urges ministers to respond by the end of February to the recommendations of the independent review carried out by the consumer champion Lynn Faulds Wood nearly two years ago. Whirlpool has been replacing or repairing an estimated 3.8m dryers across the UK after identifying the fault in November 2015, caused when fluff touched the heating element. The risk applies to some older dryers sold under the Hotpoint, Creda, Indesit, ProLine and Swan brands. Whirlpool did not issue a product recall, telling customers they could continue to use their dryer while waiting for modification, provided it was not left on and unattended. Whirlpool finally changed its advice last February when it warned customers they should unplug and stop using the machines. In October, the company told MPs that an estimated 1m machines at risk of bursting into flames were still in UK homes and a senior manager attempted to justify the company\u2019s decision not to change its advice to consumers until six months after an Indesit model caused a serious fire in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, west London. \u201cWhirlpool\u2019s woeful response to the defect in its tumble dryers has caused huge worry to people with these appliances in their homes\u201d said Labour MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs the committee. \u201cTheir delayed and dismissive response to correcting these defects has been inadequate and we call on Whirlpool to resolve issues urgently. Whirlpool must once and for all put an end to the unacceptable situation where a million machines are acting as potential fire hazards in people\u2019s homes.\u201d She said Whirlpool\u2019s response highlighted flaws in the UK\u2019s product safety regime \u201cwhich is fragmented and poorly resourced\u201d, adding: \u201cThere is a strong case for a single national product safety agency. The government must implement the recommendations of an independent review on product safety, which they have been sitting on for nearly two years.\u201d Manufacturers of highly flammable plastic-backed fridge freezers are also urged to use safer materials. The Grenfell Tower fire was sparked by a fridge freezer from Whirlpool\u2019s Hotpoint range. Whirlpool said: \u201cAfter two years of extensive measures to raise awareness to this campaign, the number of consumers coming forward has fallen sharply. We can assure consumers that they if they contact us now, they can receive a resolution within one week.\u201d Jill Paterson, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, which represents many alleged victims of fires caused by household appliances, welcomed the MPs\u2019 recommendations. \u201cWe share the \u2018deep unease\u2019 of the committee over the approach of Whirlpool and other manufacturers of appliances to the risks serious defects in their appliances pose to the British public,\u201d she said.",

Whirlpool <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/feb/22/hotpoint-indesit-tumble-dryers-fire-risk-whirlpool-creda-proline\">finally changed its advice</a> last February when it warned customers they should unplug and stop using the machines.</p> <p>In October, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/oct/31/hotpoint-indesit-whirlpool-tumble-dryers-fire-risk-uk-homes\">the company told MPs</a> that an estimated 1m machines at risk of bursting into flames were still in UK homes and a senior manager attempted to justify the company\u2019s decision not to change its advice to consumers until six months after an Indesit model caused a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/19/fire-crews-tackle-blaze-at-shepherds-bush-tower-block-london\">serious fire in Shepherd\u2019s Bush</a>, west London.</p> <p>\u201cWhirlpool\u2019s woeful response to the defect in its tumble dryers has caused huge worry to people with these appliances in their homes\u201d said Labour MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs the committee. \u201cTheir delayed and dismissive response to correcting these defects has been inadequate and we call on Whirlpool to resolve issues urgently. Whirlpool must once and for all put an end to the unacceptable situation where a million machines are acting as potential fire hazards in people\u2019s homes.\u201d<br></p> <p>She said Whirlpool\u2019s response highlighted flaws in the UK\u2019s product safety regime \u201cwhich is fragmented and poorly resourced\u201d, adding: \u201cThere is a strong case for a single national product safety agency. The government must implement the recommendations of an independent review on product safety, which they have been sitting on for nearly two years.\u201d</p> <p>Manufacturers of highly flammable plastic-backed fridge freezers are also urged to use safer materials. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire\">Grenfell Tower fire</a> was sparked by a fridge freezer from Whirlpool\u2019s Hotpoint range.</p> <p>Whirlpool said: \u201cAfter two years of extensive measures to raise awareness to this campaign, the number of consumers coming forward has fallen sharply. We can assure consumers that they if they contact us now, they can receive a resolution within one week.\u201d</p> <p>Jill Paterson, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, which represents many alleged victims of fires caused by household appliances, welcomed the MPs\u2019 recommendations. \u201cWe share the \u2018deep unease\u2019 of the committee over the approach of Whirlpool and other manufacturers of appliances to the risks serious defects in their appliances pose to the British public,\u201d she said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This year the ACTU aims to fight on a number of hot button issues in its \u201cChange the Rules\u201d campaign. Among the issues is one which sits right at the centre of the flexible work debate, and one that has quickly become heated \u2013 casual work. And while employer groups may be on safe territory arguing that the level of overall casual work has been flat for some years now, the recent increase in full-time employees and young people working casually highlights that this is not an issue that can be ignored. In an interview with the Australian, secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus recently said \u201cone of the key things we want to change for working people is turning around or reversing the casualisation of jobs\u201d. She said she would lobby for a new definition of casual work that would include workers who have a \u201creasonable expectation of ongoing work\u201d and who are completing regular shifts. One of the problems for the ACTU is that while the suggestion that 40% of Australian workers are in insecure work is valid, it is not an issue that has actually been getting worse. Currently there are around 7.5 million workers who are employed in ongoing permanent positions, either full-time or part-time. That leaves a bit over 4 million workers who are either casual employees or those who own/manage businesses \u2013 either incorporated or unincorporated. Over the past decade, the percentage of workers who are employees has, if anything, grown \u2013 from around 79% in the early 1990s to around 82%: So while there may be issues around those who run their own business, for the most part, the issue of insecure work lies with casual employees. And yet here the story is not straightforward. Around 2.5 million people in Australia are employed on a casual basis. A sizeable number to be sure, but the percentage of employees who are casually employed has stayed relatively stable for nearly 20 years: The reason the story is complex is that since the 1990s recession, Australia\u2019s workforce has changed substantially. More men now work part-time than in the past and more women now work full-time. As part-time work is more likely to involve casual employment, the proportion of women working in casual jobs has fallen, while the proportion of men working as such has risen. So in some ways, talk about the rising casualisation of work is mostly talking about men. But does that mean there are no concerns? Well no, but again the issue is complex. The reality is that you are most likely to work casual when you are young: And we need to be wary of assuming that all casual work is bad. The problem with this issue is the anecdote generally holds sway. Employer groups who favour casual work and would like to see more of it love to talk of the casually employed university student. On the other side, the example is generally of a mother working casually for years, unable to get job security or carer\u2019s leave. The reality is casual work encompasses all types. Just over 40% of casual employees have been with their current employer for less than a year, compared to around 15% of permanent employees. And yet while half of permanent workers have been with their current employer for more than five years, so too have 17% of casual workers: Is it bad for someone to be casual for so long? Again, yes and no. Much as I prefer the data over the anecdote, in my working life I have worked for a number of businesses casually for more than four years \u2013 some I wished could have been permanent, others I was quite happy with the arrangement. And here the data suggests a similar complex story. In the 2014 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey, men were generally less satisfied working casually than in a permanent position. Women, on the other hand, actually had a slightly higher level of job satisfaction if they worked casually than if they were employed permanently: But there is certainly less security for casual workers. Around 19% of casual workers do not expect to be with their same employer in 12 months time, compared to just 7% of permanently employed workers. And yet the reasons why both sets of workers expect to leave their current job again reveal the complexity of the issue. Just over half of both permanent and casual employees expect to leave their job in the next 12 months because they want to change jobs or are seeking other work. The differences lie elsewhere \u2013 casual workers are less likely to be about to retire, but are much more likely to be returning to study, travelling or leaving work for family reasons (which most likely involve child care). The other big difference is that casual workers are much more likely to be working in a seasonal job or temporary job, which is not surprising nor particularly worrying given such work \u2013 for example, fruit picking or working hospitality during peak holiday periods \u2013 is what casual work is best suited for: But before employer groups rub their hands contentedly there remain two critical areas of concern. While the proportion of casual work has not risen overall, where it has noticeably become more prominent is for full-time work. Since 2013, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of full-time casual employees \u2013 from 10.6% of full-time employees to 12.1% \u2013 equivalent to around 106,000 extra people working casually: The other big issue is younger workers. In 2013 when I wrote on casual work, I noted concern in the sizeable increase in youth workers employed casually. Since then the problem has only grown worse. In the past 10 years, the percentage of employees under 25 who work casually has risen from 47% to nearly 54%: Casual work is always a bit of a hot button issue \u2013 with everyone ready to let fly the anecdote to support their cause. The reality is much more complex. Casual work is valued by employers and employees, but it is also at risk of becoming much more entrenched in a manner that is unlikely to benefit workers. While it is not surprising that youth workers are more likely to work casually than older workers, the increasing prevalence of younger workers being employed casually has long-term issues if such work is not of the seasonal or \u201cwhile studying\u201d variety but is taking place of previously permanent positions. If this leads to the entrenchment of such arrangements as workers move into their prime earning years, then the problems become quickly exacerbated \u2013 something that looks to be occurring given the recent increase in full-time workers (especially male) now being employed casually rather than permanently. Given full-time workers are invariably the main bread winner of a household, the lack of wage security, lack of ability to bargain for a wage rise, and the inability to access leave would have major societal implications should that trend continue.",
