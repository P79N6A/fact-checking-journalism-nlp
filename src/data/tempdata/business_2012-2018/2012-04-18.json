UK taxpayers and developing countries will pick up the bill: the UK exchequer will lose \u00a31bn a year while ActionAid has estimated potential collateral damage of up to \u00a34bn to poor countries' revenues \u2013 nearly half the UK aid budget.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has come under pressure to explain when the UK's economy will begin to grow, after warnings that inflation will stay stubbornly high while average earnings remain depressed. MPs are expected to demand an explanation from the Treasury over its strategy after the Bank of England effectively scrapped plans to inject more money into the economy while admitting that inflation may not fall as fast as predicted. Paul Tucker, deputy head of the Bank, said that the rate of inflation might stay above 3% this year. That compares with previous forecasts that it would probably fall to the official 2% target by the end of 2012. He said the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) would \"guide inflation back to target in the medium term\", but admitted that \"in the near term there is considerable uncertainty about the path that it will follow\". Rising food and clothing prices pushed the consumer price index up to 3.5% in March, halting five months of decline from a peak of 5.2% in September 2011. Only one member of the MPC voted for an increase in the \u00a3325bn quantitative easing (QE) programme, according to minutes of last month's meeting. David Miles advocated another \u00a325bn injection of money into the economy, but the other eight members \u2013 including Adam Posen, who has been the committee's most persistent advocate for more QE \u2013 voted for no change, sending the pound to a 19-month high against the euro. All nine members voted to keep the base rate at 0.5%. Tucker's comments came before data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed that living standards were continuing to fall for most workers. While inflation has risen to 3.5%, average pay rises have fallen to 1.1%. Unemployment fell, however, mainly due to a rise in part-time working. The ONS said that joblessness under the government's preferred International Labour Organisation measure declined by 35,000 in the three months to February to 2.65 million \u2013 the first fall since May 2011. The unemployment rate was 8.3%, down by 0.1 percentage points. But the number of people claiming unemployment benefit is still rising, according to the ONS: the total number of people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance was 1.61 million in March, up by a modest 3,600 on a month earlier. Youth unemployment, which has been a political flashpoint, also declined slightly, by 9,000 in the three months to February (the most up-to-date figures the ONS provides), leaving a total of 1.03 million 16-to-24-year-olds looking for work. The unemployment rate for this age group was 22.2%, down from 22.3% three months earlier. However, there was a fresh increase in the number of 18-to-24-year-olds who have been unemployed for a long period. In March, there were 54,700 young people who had been claiming jobseeker's allowance for more than 12 months, up from 49,500 a month earlier. Average pay across the economy has risen by just 1.1% in the past year, dragged down by weaker City bonuses than a year ago. Excluding bonuses, pay increased by 1.6% \u2013 less than half the pace of inflation. The Treasury had been expecting to reap the benefits of rising consumer confidence by the end of the year, following predictions that wages would begin to increase by more than inflation, which is forecast to remain at 2% during 2013. Higher employment levels are also forecast to support consumer sentiment and help turn around an economy that has barely grown since September 2010. Economists warned that higher than expected inflation at a time when wages remain subdued could undermine forecasts of recovery in 2013. The Commons Treasury select committee has said that forecasting by the Treasury's watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which uses Bank of England data, should use a wider range of measures to determine the path of the economy. The committee said it was upset that forecasts had proved unreliable and needed to to be constantly revised.",

The amount of bad loans on the books of Spanish banks has risen to an 18-year high of 8.15% in February and accounted for \u20ac143.8bn (\u00a3117.7bn) of their outstanding \u20ac1.76 trillion of loans.</p> <p>EU data for the construction industry revealed a dramatic collapse in activity last month with Italy one of the worst affected nations.</p> <p>Tensions inside the EU, which had abated after a lending spree by the European Central Bank before Christmas, began to resurface after the boss of the German central Bank, Jens Weidmann, warned Spain to sort out its own finances without seeking an international bailout.</p> <p>But several economists believe that Spanish banks will have to turn to the euro zone's rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), for help in covering losses caused by a property market crash.</p> <p>Likewise, investors are fretting about how Spain's centre-right government can enforce deep austerity while reviving a recession-bound economy at the same time.</p> <p>\"They're going to need EFSF money to recapitalise the banking sector,\" said Carsten Brzeski, a senior economist at ING in Brussels. \"I think we'll only see a real end to the Spanish misery if the real-estate market stabilises.\"</p> <p>Madrid is likely to hold out for some time. \"The underlying picture in Spain is dramatic, but is it dramatic in the way that it needs a bailout package tomorrow? No,\" Brzeski said. \"But if you look ahead, let's say the next six months, I would not be surprised if they [the banks] have to get some kind of European support.\"</p> <p>Some of the biggest investor groups are betting Spain and Portugal will be frozen out of international money markets within the next 18 months and are hedging against Germany being forced to act as lender of last resort.</p> <p>A US hedge fund run by the billionaire John Paulson, who earned huge profits when the financial crisis struck from bets against the overheated US housing market, revealed he was now shorting European sovereign bonds, including Germany. Paulson expects the euro crisis to deepen and eventually undermine Berlin's status as a safe haven.</p> <p>The head of German life insurer Allianz Leben, Maximilian Zimmerer, appeared to support this view in an interview with financial daily Handelsblatt. He said the safety of long-term German government bonds was overrated.</p> <p>\"They are overvalued; the yield is too low. If a eurozone country runs into trouble, Germany in any case will have to pick up the bill in the end,\" Zimmerer said.</p> <p>Spain is widely considered to be nearing the point where it enters a debt spiral as rising unemployment and falling house prices undermine its banks, which in turn have kept the government afloat by lending it hundreds of billions of euros, much of it borrowed from the ECB.</p> <p>The struggling right-wing administration of Mariano Rajoy, has dismissed concerns that he could be forced to plead for funds from Brussels despite wrestling with declining tax receipts and conflicts with regional government that are seeking to block spending cuts.</p> <p>The Madrid stock market has fallen more than 15% in recent months amid increasing concerns for the key banking sector. Defaults are rising and credit is shrinking at a record pace as 24% unemployment undermines the quality of loans built up in the country's credit boom and saps the appetite of banks to make new ones.</p> <p>Mario Monti's government made matters worse after he said the Italian economy would suffer a 1.2% fall in GDP in 2012, not the 0.4% decline previously pencilled in. He also admitted the deficit will be higher than planned over the next two years.</p> <p>It now expects to post a deficit of 0.5% of GDP next year, up from a previous target of 0.1%.</p> <p>European construction industry data added to the gloom in Rome. It showed activity fell by 3.7% across the EU in February, and by 7.1% within the eurozone. Italy's construction sector saw a 9.9% decrease in output.</p>",

Stock markets tumbled across Europe after the Italian prime minister Mario Monti warned that he would miss deficit targets agreed with Brussels after suffering slower than expected growth. A report by Spain's central bank also spooked the markets after it revealed a dramatic rise in the value of bad loans held by the country's banks. The amount of bad loans on the books of Spanish banks has risen to an 18-year high of 8.15% in February and accounted for \u20ac143.8bn (\u00a3117.7bn) of their outstanding \u20ac1.76 trillion of loans. EU data for the construction industry revealed a dramatic collapse in activity last month with Italy one of the worst affected nations. Tensions inside the EU, which had abated after a lending spree by the European Central Bank before Christmas, began to resurface after the boss of the German central Bank, Jens Weidmann, warned Spain to sort out its own finances without seeking an international bailout. But several economists believe that Spanish banks will have to turn to the euro zone's rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), for help in covering losses caused by a property market crash. Likewise, investors are fretting about how Spain's centre-right government can enforce deep austerity while reviving a recession-bound economy at the same time. \"They're going to need EFSF money to recapitalise the banking sector,\" said Carsten Brzeski, a senior economist at ING in Brussels. \"I think we'll only see a real end to the Spanish misery if the real-estate market stabilises.\" Madrid is likely to hold out for some time. \"The underlying picture in Spain is dramatic, but is it dramatic in the way that it needs a bailout package tomorrow? No,\" Brzeski said. \"But if you look ahead, let's say the next six months, I would not be surprised if they [the banks] have to get some kind of European support.\" Some of the biggest investor groups are betting Spain and Portugal will be frozen out of international money markets within the next 18 months and are hedging against Germany being forced to act as lender of last resort. A US hedge fund run by the billionaire John Paulson, who earned huge profits when the financial crisis struck from bets against the overheated US housing market, revealed he was now shorting European sovereign bonds, including Germany. Paulson expects the euro crisis to deepen and eventually undermine Berlin's status as a safe haven. The head of German life insurer Allianz Leben, Maximilian Zimmerer, appeared to support this view in an interview with financial daily Handelsblatt. He said the safety of long-term German government bonds was overrated. \"They are overvalued; the yield is too low. If a eurozone country runs into trouble, Germany in any case will have to pick up the bill in the end,\" Zimmerer said. Spain is widely considered to be nearing the point where it enters a debt spiral as rising unemployment and falling house prices undermine its banks, which in turn have kept the government afloat by lending it hundreds of billions of euros, much of it borrowed from the ECB. The struggling right-wing administration of Mariano Rajoy, has dismissed concerns that he could be forced to plead for funds from Brussels despite wrestling with declining tax receipts and conflicts with regional government that are seeking to block spending cuts. The Madrid stock market has fallen more than 15% in recent months amid increasing concerns for the key banking sector. Defaults are rising and credit is shrinking at a record pace as 24% unemployment undermines the quality of loans built up in the country's credit boom and saps the appetite of banks to make new ones. Mario Monti's government made matters worse after he said the Italian economy would suffer a 1.2% fall in GDP in 2012, not the 0.4% decline previously pencilled in. He also admitted the deficit will be higher than planned over the next two years. It now expects to post a deficit of 0.5% of GDP next year, up from a previous target of 0.1%. European construction industry data added to the gloom in Rome. It showed activity fell by 3.7% across the EU in February, and by 7.1% within the eurozone. Italy's construction sector saw a 9.9% decrease in output.",

That was the assessment of David Cameron, speaking in the Commons on Wednesday. It's easy to see why he was in a bullish mood. Unemployment figures were good, Britain is seen as a safe haven, and there is no immediate threat to the UK's cherished AAA status. But is the UK really getting to grips with its deficit? The government has a plan: the question is whether it is working. Research by the International Monetary Fund suggests Cameron should perhaps be a bit more circumspect with his claims. Every six months, the fund produces its Fiscal Monitor, which looks at the finances of each member state. Its findings are not encouraging. \"In the UK, actual and potential GDP growth estimates have been revised down, resulting in weaker projections for both headline and cyclically adjusted balances,\" the fund says. This is a double whammy. Not only is growth currently weak, the damage caused to the economy by the recession means that its ability to grow in the future has been impaired. That means the public finances look worse, both in headline terms and also when adjusted for the economic cycle. Last September, the IMF expected the UK to run a budget deficit this year of 7.1%, falling to 5.1% in 2013. The latest estimates are for 8% this year and 6.6% next \u2013 a sizeable deterioration. Not all of this is due to the flatlining of the economy since the third quarter of 2010. The forecast for the cyclically adjusted deficit has been revised up from 4.7% to 5.1% this year and from 3% to 3.8% in 2013. Put into context, Britain's finances are in worse shape (both in headline and cyclically adjusted terms) than those of Italy and Spain \u2013 countries at the centre of the euro crisis. The forecasts run until 2017: by then the UK will still be in deficit on both measures. A number of conclusions can be drawn. First, it is not true that the deficit reduction plan set out by the coalition is working. Progress has been much slower than forecast. Second, unless the government's supply-side reforms can boost the economy's potential growth rate, knocking the public finances back into shape will require yet more austerity. Third, it is something of a miracle that the markets have yet to latch on to the UK's combination of weak growth and unmet deficit-reduction targets. The fact that Britain is not part of the single currency, and can thus allow its currency rather than its bond market to take the strain of adjustment, probably has something to do with it. Fourth, ministers would be unwise to imagine that the UK will remain a safe haven for ever. Should the economy continue to flatline for a further six months, the markets might start to look at Britain with a more critical eye.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Europe's banks risk triggering a major credit crunch if they all take drastic action to repair their balance sheets at the same time, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday. In its half-yearly look at the state of the global financial system, the IMF said it was \"essential to continue to avoid a synchronised, large-scale, and aggressive trimming of balance sheets that could do serious damage to asset prices, credit supply, and economic activity in Europe and beyond.\" The IMF said it expected 58 of the biggest banks in the European Union to slim down by $2.6bn (\u00a31.6bn) by the end of 2013, or almost 7% of their assets. While 75% of the deleveraging would be as a result of asset sales, credit would also be harder to obtain. In the event governments stalled on reforms or were overwhelmed by fresh shocks to the system, the Global Financial Stability Review warned of a much more severe credit crunch that would see balance sheets reduced by almost $4 trillion and credit supply cut by 4.4%. The review said risks to global financial stability were high despite the actions taken at the end of 2011 to deal with an intense crisis in the eurozone. \"Pressures on European banks remain elevated. Banks are coping with sovereign risks, weak economic growth, high rollover requirements, and the need to strengthen capital cushions to regain investor confidence. \"Together, these pressures have induced a broad-based drive to reduce the size of bank balance sheets. Although some deleveraging is both inevitable and desirable, its precise impact depends on the nature, pace and scale of asset shedding.\" It said there was a risk of conditions deteriorating if current policies fell short of what had been agreed, national policies faltered, political solidarity underpinning euro area reforms fragmented, or shocks overwhelmed the firewalls. In this scenario, credit spreads would widen, making government funding costs prohibitive and adding to the deleveraging pressures on banks. In the worst case, the IMF said, the eurozone would have a deeper recession than that currently forecast by its economists. It believes that the 17 nations that are part of monetary union will contract by 0.3% in 2012 before growing by 0.9% in 2013 but a more pronounced credit crunch would see gross domestic product cut by 1.4% after two years. \"There is a risk that a large-scale reduction in assets by European banks could lead to a credit crunch.\" It added: \"European firms are particularly vulnerable to reduction in bank credit because of their greater reliance on banks for funding and often limited ability to adjust labour costs, at least compared with their US peers.\" The IMF identified two short-term and two medium-term policies that would help create financial stability. The immediate need, it said, was for a credible firewall that was big enough to stem contagion, and for further progress on bank restructuring and resolution. In the longer term, it urged measures to complete the architecture of European monetary union \u2013 a road map for a pan-euro area financial stability framework and progress towards greater fiscal risk sharing. \"The path ahead has significant political and implementation risks, and policies need to be further strengthened to secure and entrench financial stability. Policymakers should therefore build on recently agreed reforms and complete the policy agenda. \"Policymakers also need to co-ordinate a careful mix of financial, macroeconomic and structural policies to ensure a smooth deleveraging process that puts the financial system in a good position to support the economy.\" While the eurozone was the focus of the report, it noted that both Japan and the United States had yet to forge a political consensus for medium-term deficit reduction, which was crucial to secure debt sustainability and preserve market confidence.",

      "body": "<p>US school budget cuts have hit sales at whiteboard maker <strong>Promethean World</strong>, knocking nearly 20% off the value of its shares.</p> <p>The company said first quarter revenues were down 14.4% year on year to \u00a335.9m, with north American sales down 40%. This was \"a greater decline than anticipated.\" And with US demand being volatile, the company said it was too early to tell whether the first quarter fall was indicative of the full year result:</p> <blockquote> It is the key buying season from June to September in the US that will better inform our outlook for the year, and the third quarter will be a more important period in the north America sales cycle for 2012. We therefore remain cautious in our outlook. </blockquote> <p>Promethean's shares are down 14.25p to 59p. Peel Hunt cut its price target from 100p to 70p, and analyst Alex Jarvis said:</p> <blockquote> A very weak start to the year comes as a surprise after a fourth quarter beat and against weak first quarter 2011 comparisons. US sales were down 40%, partially offset by International sales (+22%). The second and third quarter are the key trading periods for Promethean, but the volatility in the first quarter leads us to downgrade our 2012 earnings per share forecast by 9%.

      "bodyText": "US school budget cuts have hit sales at whiteboard maker Promethean World, knocking nearly 20% off the value of its shares. The company said first quarter revenues were down 14.4% year on year to \u00a335.9m, with north American sales down 40%. This was \"a greater decline than anticipated.\" And with US demand being volatile, the company said it was too early to tell whether the first quarter fall was indicative of the full year result: It is the key buying season from June to September in the US that will better inform our outlook for the year, and the third quarter will be a more important period in the north America sales cycle for 2012. We therefore remain cautious in our outlook. Promethean's shares are down 14.25p to 59p. Peel Hunt cut its price target from 100p to 70p, and analyst Alex Jarvis said: A very weak start to the year comes as a surprise after a fourth quarter beat and against weak first quarter 2011 comparisons. US sales were down 40%, partially offset by International sales (+22%). The second and third quarter are the key trading periods for Promethean, but the volatility in the first quarter leads us to downgrade our 2012 earnings per share forecast by 9%. We had hoped that 2012 forecasts were positioned for upgrades, and the shift in risk is reflected in a larger percentage downgrade to our target price and a move to hold (from buy). Meanwhile Liberum Capital has repeated its sell recommendation on publisher and educational specialist Pearson, down 1p at \u00a311.32, following the Promethean news.

    "webTitle": "Tesco's UK profits fall for first time in two decades", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco has signalled the end of the supermarket space race as it slammed the brakes on aggressive UK expansion to focus on a \u00a31bn makeover of its existing outlets and website. The supermarket giant is trying to win back disgruntled shoppers after a shock profit warning in January exposed cracks in its UK business. Its chief executive Philip Clarke said on Wednesday that the investment would \"put the heart and soul back into Tesco\", which has been forced to reassess itself after suffering its first decline in UK profits in more than 20 years. \"We fully recognise that we need to raise our game in the UK,\" said Clarke as the group reported a 1% fall in UK profits to \u00a32.5bn. With more than 2,700 stores, Tesco's domestic chain pumps out two-thirds of the group's profits. But Clarke said it had taken \"a little bit too much away from the shopper\" during years of penny-pinching to boost profits. To win their custom back, Clarke promised more staff on the shop floor as well as \"better\" products, prices and promotions. The grocer will invest \u00a3200m on 8,000 new staff for its large stores and fresh food departments, plus initiatives such as dedicated \"fruit and veg teams\" clad in green uniforms to help customers. It also plans to revamp 8,000 products in its standard ranges - 40% of its UK food sales. An initial 430 outlets will be overhauled this year, with the grocer promising new-look stores with a \"warmer\" atmosphere after shoppers complained that its stores felt cold and clinical. Clarke said that last year's \u00a3500m price cuts initiative, the \"Big Price Drop\", had resulted in a pickup in sales volumes, but not the \"desired improvement in customer price perception\". With savvy shoppers jaded by the rhetoric of supermarket price wars, Clarke added that he wanted to \"build trust in our pricing\". Tesco's problems come as retailers grapple with structural changes caused by growing numbers of consumers shopping from computers and smartphones. Clarke has slashed Tesco's \"physical\" opening plans for this year by nearly 40% as it prepares for the \"digital era\". But it will still open more than 100 stores as it focuses on expanding the Express and Metro chains alongside \"dotcom-only\" stores, which are used to fulfil internet orders. The sprawling Extra stores seem to be falling out of favour as shopping habits change, with clothing, DVDs and gadgets increasingly bought online. Instead Tesco is creating an Argos-style Click &amp; Collect business where shoppers can collect goods ordered online. The service is to be rolled out to another 700 stores this year. Although Tesco has curtailed its expansion, analysts said its might would not be diminished, as its store opening plans remained the biggest in the industry. Kantar Retail analyst Himanshu Pal said Tesco was \"not on its knees, just off the boil\". \"There has been a clear lack of investment in stores and staff for the last couple of years. The retailer now trails several competitors in terms of fresh food offer, customer service and in-store standards.\" Shares closed down 2% at 321.05p. Profits at Tesco's international business, which takes in 12 countries including China and Thailand, rose nearly 18% at \u00a31.1bn. Its contribution resulted in an overall increase in profits for the group of 1.3% to \u00a33.8bn in the year to 25 February. Clarke moved the target that US chain Fresh &amp; Easy breaks even from the current financial year to next year after it made \"slower progress\" than expected. Some investors have called for Tesco to pull out of the US, which has absorbed more than \u00a31bn of investment, but Clarke said it was sticking with a chain that would provide \"decades of growth\". The four-year-old US chain, run by Tesco deputy chief executive Tim Mason, made a loss of \u00a3153m on sales of \u00a3638m. Clarke also signalled faith in the future of Tesco Bank, another business he inherited from long-serving predecessor Sir Terry Leahy. It has faced recent scrutiny from shareholders, with work on its IT systems complete and the financial services arm now \"ready for further growth\". Credit Suisse analyst Andrew Kasoulis said Tesco had put \"meat on the bones\" of its plans to revitalise the 2,700 store UK chain with the positives \"slightly\" outweighing negatives. The extra year it would take Fresh &amp; Easy to break even was disappointing, said Kasoulis.",

      "body": "<p>Unemployment has fallen for the first time in almost a year, raising hopes of a spring bounce in the UK's fragile economy.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said unemployment on the government's preferred International Labour Organisation measure declined by 35,000 in the three months to February to 2.65 million \u2013 the first fall since May 2011. The unemployment rate was 8.3%, down by 0.1 percentage points.</p> <p>The number of people claiming unemployment benefit is still rising, however, according to the ONS. The total number of people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance was 1.61 million in March, up by a modest 3,600 on a month earlier.</p> <p>Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \"Overall the latest jobs data are relatively encouraging overall and supportive to hopes that the economy has returned to underlying modest growth.\"</p> <p>Official figures to be published next Wednesday will reveal whether the economy expanded in the first three months of 2012. A negative number would signal recession.</p> <p>Youth unemployment, which has been a political flashpoint, also declined slightly, by 9,000 in the three months to February (the most up-to-date figures the ONS provides), leaving a total of 1.03 million 16- to 24-year-olds looking for work. The unemployment rate for this age group was 22.2%, down from 22.3% three months earlier.</p> <p>However, there was a fresh increase in the number of 18- to 24-year-olds who have been unemployed for a long period. In March, there were 54,700 young people who had been claiming jobseeker's allowance for more than 12 months, up from 49,500 a month earlier.</p> <p>Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, has suggested that the sharp rise in this measure could reveal problems with the government's Work Programme, which outsources the job of tackling long-term unemployment to a series of private sector providers.</p> <p>The data also underlines the squeeze on living standards faced by many households.

Excluding bonuses, pay increased by 1.6% \u2013 less than half the pace of inflation.</p>", 
      "bodyText": "Unemployment has fallen for the first time in almost a year, raising hopes of a spring bounce in the UK's fragile economy. The Office for National Statistics said unemployment on the government's preferred International Labour Organisation measure declined by 35,000 in the three months to February to 2.65 million \u2013 the first fall since May 2011. The unemployment rate was 8.3%, down by 0.1 percentage points. The number of people claiming unemployment benefit is still rising, however, according to the ONS. The total number of people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance was 1.61 million in March, up by a modest 3,600 on a month earlier. Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \"Overall the latest jobs data are relatively encouraging overall and supportive to hopes that the economy has returned to underlying modest growth.\" Official figures to be published next Wednesday will reveal whether the economy expanded in the first three months of 2012. A negative number would signal recession. Youth unemployment, which has been a political flashpoint, also declined slightly, by 9,000 in the three months to February (the most up-to-date figures the ONS provides), leaving a total of 1.03 million 16- to 24-year-olds looking for work. The unemployment rate for this age group was 22.2%, down from 22.3% three months earlier. However, there was a fresh increase in the number of 18- to 24-year-olds who have been unemployed for a long period. In March, there were 54,700 young people who had been claiming jobseeker's allowance for more than 12 months, up from 49,500 a month earlier. Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, has suggested that the sharp rise in this measure could reveal problems with the government's Work Programme, which outsources the job of tackling long-term unemployment to a series of private sector providers. The data also underlines the squeeze on living standards faced by many households. Average pay across the economy has risen by just 1.1% in the past year, dragged down by weaker City bonuses than a year ago. Excluding bonuses, pay increased by 1.6% \u2013 less than half the pace of inflation.",
