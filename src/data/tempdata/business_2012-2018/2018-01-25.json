      "bodyText": "A late PS, from the Associated Press\u2019s Pan Pylas on the moment Trump arrived at the World Economic Forum. One way to get President Donald Trump to stop and talk at the World Economic Forum: wield a book about him. On his way into the World Economic Forum, Trump stopped and talked for about ten seconds to one delegate who was brandishing a copy of \u201cGod and Donald Trump\u201d by Stephen E. Strang. He then proceeded to hold the book aloft in his left hand. Trump is the first U.S. president to attend the World Economic Forum since Bill Clinton back in 2000. Trump is holding a series of meetings and is due to deliver a speech on Friday in which he will argue that what is good for the U.S. economy is beneficial for the global economy. And finally, readers will be keen to know that Donald Trump is probably tucked up in bed. Here\u2019s the final dispatch: Motorcade arrived at the Intercontinental at 9:23. Pool did not see POTUS get out. He will sleep here tonight. That\u2019s all from us until tomorrow! Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u2019s some colour from Donald Trump\u2019s dinner with business leaders, from the White House press pack: President Trump\u2019s eyes narrowed, as he looked a bit tired by the jetlag and long trip. But he seemed to enjoy the camaraderie with businessmen, joking with them about their success and lofty responsibilities, and nodding in agreement as they spoke about their large manufacturing capacity and thousands of US-based employees. Among the topics discussed: Kanye West\u2019s role in designing Adidas shoes, Mack Trucks made by Volvo, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s non-chocolate business portfolio. Among Trump\u2019s asides: \u201cWhen he says he works for Siemens, he\u2019s the president of Siemens!...Wow, that\u2019s big!....Good luck with the G.E. purchase.\u201d Trump spoke about the thriving American economy \u2013 crediting his tax policies, deregulation and his role as a cheerleader for American business. Soros then claims the bitcoin price will be propped by up by dictators, who use it to \u2018build their nest eggs abroad\u201d. Q: As a former currency trader (who beat the Bank of England on Black Wednesday) what do you think of cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin is not a currency, Soros replies. A currency is supposed to be a stable store of value, and a currency that can fluctuate 25% in a day can\u2019t be used to pay wages It\u2019s a speculation, based on a misunderstanding. Soros suggest the EU should help Africa\u2019s economy develop, if it wants to address the migration crisis. Onto questions. Q: What should be done to tackle the technology giants? It\u2019s a very complicated issue, Soros replies. It requires the full-time attention of those who formulate and enforce new laws. I put my faith in them, especially commissioner Vestigar who has done so much to enforce the laws - and made an award against Google. Q: If you don\u2019t like social media companies, why do you buy shares in them? calls out a diner from the back of the room. Soros doesn\u2019t reply (I\u2019m not sure he heard). Instead he takes a question about migration, saying he cares about refugees because he was one himself; he came to Britain and was better treated than refugees arriving in Europe today. Another punchy quote from Soros: On Europe, Soros suggests that a multi-speed, multi-track approach would be more successful. This would allow Britain to rejoin the EU in the future without having to commit to joining the euro, explained Soros (who hasn\u2019t given up hope that Brexit won\u2019t happen). George Soros then turns his guns at the technology sector. In a blistering attack, he accuses social media companies of \u201cdeliberately engineering addiction\u201d, which is \u201cparticularly harmful\u201d for adolescents. He accuses them of inducing customers to give up their autonomy too. Soros says there are similarities between internet platforms and gambling platforms - pointing out that casinos have developed techniques to hook customers so they keep gambling even when they\u2019ve run out of money. But... while tech giants may think they\u2019re masters of the universe, they are actually just slaves to preserving their dominant position Soros continues. It\u2019s only a matter of time before the monopoly of the US IT giants is broken, he declares: Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered. Regulation and taxation will be their undoing. I see Trump as a purely temporary phenomenon which will disappear in 2020, or earlier, Soros says - winning a laugh from his audience as they tuck into their chicken, potatoes and spinach. Soros adds that he expects a Democratic landslide in 2018. America must recognise the reality that North Korea has become a nuclear power, Soros continues. There is no military action that can prevent what has already happened. The only sensible strategy is to accept reality\u2026.and come to terms with North Koreas as a nuclear power. That means working with China to find a solution. Soros says that the survival of our whole civilisation is at stake, due to the rise of Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Donald Trump in the United States. They both seem to be willing to risk a nuclear war to keep themselves in power. At another dinner in Davos, billionaire businessman-turned-philanthopist George Soros is giving his views on the state of the world. He\u2019s warning that open societies are in crisis, with various forms of dictatorship on the rise - such as Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. \u201cIn the United States, President Trump would like to establish a mafia state, but can\u2019t\u201d, Soros continues, because America\u2019s institutions, constitution and its \u201cvibrant civil society\u201d won\u2019t allow it. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story about the prospect of Donald Trump visiting the UK later this year: UK government officials have been updating the British press about Theresa May\u2019s meeting with Donald Trump this afternoon, shortly after he arrived at WEF (and brought it to a standstill). Mark Knoller, CBS News White House Correspondent, has details of Trump\u2019s dinner with European business chiefs: Donald Trump is now sitting down for diner with the bosses of some of Europe\u2019s biggest companies. Mark Tucker, the chairman of HSBC, and Punit Renjen, the chief executive of Deloitte, are flying the flag for Britain - according to this guest list from the White House press pack: President Donald J. Trump Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Department of State Secretary Kirstjen Nielson, Department of Homeland Security General H.R. McMaster, National Security Advisor Gary Cohn, Director of the National Economic Council Kasper Rorsted, Adidas (Apparel)\u2014Germany Joe Kaeser, Siemens AG (Tech)\u2014Germany Heinrich Hiesinger, Thyssenkrupp AG (Industrials)\u2014Germany Eldar Saetre, Statoil ASA (Energy)\u2014Norway Mark Schneider, Nestle SA (Food and Beverage)\u2014Switzerland Vas Narasimhan, Novartis AG (Pharmaceutical)\u2014Switzerland Mark Tucker, HSBC (Financial Services)\u2014UK Patrick Pouyanne, Total SA (Energy)\u2014France Carlos Brito, Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (Food and Beverage)\u2014Belgium Rajeev Suri, Nokia Corporation (Technology)\u2014Finland Punit Renjen, Deloitte (Consulting)\u2014UK Martian Lundstedt, AB Volvo (Auto)\u2014Sweden Werner Baumann, Bayer AG (Pharmaceutical)\u2014Germany Bill McDermott, SAP SE (Technology)\u2014Germany Ulrich Spiesshofer, ABB Ltd (Manufacturing)\u2014Switzerland \u2022 This list was amended on 26 January 2018 to correct inaccurate details provided by the White House press office. The spelling of Carlos Brito\u2019s first name was corrected from Carols, and the location of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV\u2019s headquarters has been corrected from the Netherlands to Belgium. President Trump is likely to face protests if and when his visit to the UK takes place, even if it is just a \u201cworking visit\u201d. For a start, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson pulled no punches, saying: \u201cTrump is a dangerous, misogynistic racist and is deserving of the protests he will undoubtedly face. \u201cIf and when he comes to the UK the Liberal Democrats will be at front and centre of the protests.\u201d The White House says Theresa May and Donald Trump discussed plans for a \u201cworking visit\u201d to London. That may mean that it won\u2019t be a full-blown state visit. A working visit would mean less pomp and ceremony (and probably not a visit to see the Queen). Here\u2019s the official statement (which includes that all-important nod to the Special Relationship). President Donald J. Trump met today with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom. The President and Prime Minister discussed joint efforts to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS and other jihadist terrorist organizations in Syria and Iraq. They discussed the importance of confronting Iran\u2019s destructive behavior across the Middle East and fundamental flaws in the Iran nuclear deal. The leaders committed to expanded trade between the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as how the two countries can work together to ensure all nations engage in fair and reciprocal trade practices. The two leaders also discussed plans for a working visit to London in the coming months and affirmed the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the two countries is stronger than ever. Donald Trump emerged from his meetings a little while ago, and briefly chatted with delegates who hadn\u2019t been driven away by security. He said his first day at Davos had been \u201creally good\u201d and \u201cvery successful\u201d, before calling it a \u201cvery great day\u201d. Here\u2019s the key quote (with thanks to the White House press corp) \u201cI think the real message is we want great prosperity and we want great peace and I think that\u2019s the message. It\u2019s been going really well. A lot of people are coming back to the United States. We are seeing tremendous investment and today has been a very exciting day. Very great day and great for our country. Thank you very much.\u201d Here\u2019s more details: Q: Is America great? Trump: \u201cAmerica\u2019s great\u201d Q: Is everybody else great? \u201cEveryone\u2019s great,\u201d Trump said, turning his head toward the questioner as he walked through the convention hallway. Donald Trump may be in the spotlight in Davos today, but it was Wednesday\u2019s comments by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin about the dollar which caused ructions at the European Central Bank. Mnuchin said that a weaker dollar was good for American trade, and ECB president Mario Draghi suggested this was not in the spirit of an agreement between governments made in October in Washington. Draghi said: Ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed to] refrain from competitive devaluations and not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. He said the current exchange rate volatility was partly due to\u201dthe use of language in discussing exchange rate developments that doesn\u2019t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed.\u201d Mnuchin\u2019s comments yesterday sent an already weak dollar still lower. Marco Valli, chief European economist at UniCredit Bank, said: [The ECB] remains fairly relaxed about the effects of a stronger euro, but bluntly criticised the recent foreign exchange messages from the US administration, seen as violating the long-standing international commitment to avoid competitive devaluation. And of course Donald Trump has tweeted about his meeting with Theresa May: Theresa May\u2019s meeting with Donald Trump at Davos took place shortly after she gave a special address to the World Economic Forum (highlights start here) May focused on the opportunities and threats of new technology, and Britain\u2019s efforts to equip its economy for the challenges ahead. Paul Sheard, chief global economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings, tells us that she missed a trick by not also talking about Brexit, and UK-US relations. Prime Minister May made a strong pitch for the UK to be seen as a global leader in AI and regulation-friendly innovation, but \u200eI thought her not spending some time laying out the UK government\u2019s latest thinking on Brexit - particularly what it aspires for the all-important future relationship - was a bit of a missed opportunity. We don\u2019t know what details still need to be finalised, so it\u2019s possible that officials can\u2019t actually get Donald Trump\u2019s visit nailed down. One possible hitch might be the certainty of large protests against the US president from British citizens appalled by his view on climate change, accusations of sexual harassment, the Muslim ban, his America First policies - to name just four. Trump is reportedly rather worried about facing major protests - something he\u2019s been spared in Davos, due to its ultra-tight security net. Bloomberg reported this week that the US president had asked May to make sure he got a good reception. In one phone conversation during 2017, Trump complained to May over the criticism he\u2019d been getting in British newspapers. Amid warnings that Trump would face protests in the streets when he arrived, he told the prime minister he would not be coming to the U.K. until she could promise him a warm welcome. It\u2019s official. Barring a few details, US president Donald Trump will visit the United Kingdom later this year. May and Trump asked their respective officials to work on \u2018finalising the details\u2019 of a trip, at the end of their bilateral meeting here in the World Economic Forum. A Downing Street spokesman says that: The PM and President concluded by asking officials to work together on finalising the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year.\u201d There\u2019s no word on when it might happen, though. Downing Street also say that the two leaders discussed Brexit, Iran, terrorism, and worries that jobs could lost at Bombardier\u2019s factory in Northern Ireland due to the trade dispute with Boeing. The spokesman says: The two leaders began by discussing Bombardier, with the PM reiterating the importance of the company\u2019s jobs in Northern Ireland. The PM and the President discussed Iran, and the need to work together to combat the destabilising activity which it is conducting in the region, including ballistic missile development, and continuing efforts to ensure Iran does not develop nuclear weapons. They also agreed on the importance of continuing to stand side-by-side in the fight against Daesh in Syria and elsewhere. The Prime Minister updated the President on the good progress which had been made in the Brexit negotiations so far. The two leaders reiterated their desire for a strong trading relationship post-Brexit, which would be in the interests of both countries. NEWSFLASH: Theresa May and Donald Trump have asked officials to work on \u201cfinalising the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year\u201d, Downing Street said. More to follow. Swiss campaign group CAMPAX have hung a Trump protest banner on a mountain at Sargans - about 50 kilometres from Davos. Here\u2019s a photo of the Davos meeting room which Donald Trump and his delegation swept into, a couple of hours ago: There\u2019s still a huge crowd at the bottom of the stairs; I think there\u2019s only one way out.... During his meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, president Trump suggested that aid would be withheld from the Palestinians if they didn\u2019t show respect. He said \u201cthey disrespected our great Vice President\u201d (Last November, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas didn\u2019t meet Mike Pence during his visit to the Middle East). Trump said (via the White House pool report): \u201cThe money is on the table. And the money was never off the table. [Yesterday, it was reported that former US secretary of state John Kerry had advised Abbas not to give in to Trump\u2019s demands] Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu has returned from his meeting with Trump. He says it was \u201cexcellent\u201d. Here\u2019s the White House pool report on the Trump-May meeting: President Trump and PM May sat beside one another in a WEF conference room with aides on each side. Among them on US side: Gary Cohn, HR McMaster, Tillerson, Sarah Sanders. Highlights: Trump \u201cIts a false rumor\u201d that there is tension in the US-UK relationship. \u201cWe\u2019re on the same wavelength in I think every respect\u201d The two are \u201cliking each other a lot\u201d and \u201cjoined at the hip\u201d when it comes to the military. He looked at her and said there was nothing that would happen where the US would not be there for Britain. May also reaffirmed the special relationship. When asked about a state visit, May said it\u2019s being discussed now. Trump seconded that. No answers to shouted questions about the far right video retweet [back in November, Trump retweeted several anti-Muslim videos] Donald Trump has also talked about the prospect of a trade deal with the UK, but only in very general terms. Trade between the US and the UK is going to increase \u2018many times\u2019, Trump said during his meeting with May, adding: The discussions...that will be taking place are going to lead to tremendous increase in trade between our countries, which is great for both in terms of jobs. Q: But what about a state visit to Britain? May and Trump say they\u2019ll talk about that during their meeting at Davos. Several people have come down the stairs where Donald Trump\u2019s meetings are taking place. I\u2019ve spied IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Europe\u2019s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, and Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor John McDonnell. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve all been meeting the US president - there\u2019s more than one room up there. Q: How large an effect does your communication have on exchange rate? When I said communication I didn\u2019t mean ECB communication but other people\u2019s communication. We don\u2019t target exchange rate. When someone says a good exchange rate is good, that is targeting exchange rate. That goes back to years ago before the [recent] terms of agreement were agreed. Q:Why did you chooses September to end QE? Commodities are priced in dollars and could effect inflation data. When we recalibrated programme last October we had a discussion whether it should be six or nine months, and how much. So after that we came out with this educated outcome. In defining our objective we have different definitions, including underlying inflation which excludes energy etc. We target headline inflation, but we look at evidence from other definitions. Q: Oil price has risen significantly since December, could that cancel out strong euro. Yes, although it\u2019s not easy to understand exactly the timing of these compensations. That doesn\u2019t imply we accept a certain level of exchange rate as a good or bad thing. And with that it\u2019s over. Q: how do you feel about ECB communications this year including from individual members, could it be improved. What level of concern was there today about a possible change in US policy [after US dollar comments] Yes there was concern. It was broader than simply the exchange rate, but about broader state of international relations right now. If this leads to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy we would have to think about our monetary policy strategy. On communications, you see same thing in other jurisdictions. All the communiations since Dec have in common three characteristics. All based on commitment to objective of inflation target. None questioned the sequence whereby interest rates will stay at current levels well past end of asset buying programme. Well past was emphasised. Q: Some commentators factoring in an interest rate rise this year? At its current level does euro reflect fundamentals? Based on today\u2019s data I see very few chances at all that interest rates can be raised this year. On euro, we should ask is it produced by strength of economy, or by statements, or by monetary policy elsewhere. Q: Another question on the G30 membership, could it compromise ECB? Draghi repeats his previous answer, but adds ombudsman said there was no evidence the meeting influenced ECB, and ECB must have contacts with other financial participants. Q: Will differences of views within ECB deepen on exit strategy? At March meeting, will you give restatement of forward guidance. I don\u2019t think the differences are as substantive as they were on other occasions. Some are a little more confident, if they live where inflation is rising. But there are not deep existential differences. But there may be differences on when to say certain things, when to move forward. Markets have expectations on path, but also on dates, timelines. In March we will assess how things stand at that point in time. Away from Davis briefly and back with the ECB, and president Mario Draghi said at his press conference that domestic price pressures remained muted, inflation has yet to show a convincing upward trend. He said the recent foreign exchange volatility is a source of uncertainty. An ample degree of monetary stimulus is necessary. On the economy, he said there could be positive growth surprise in the near term. But there were downside risks remain relating to global factors, forex. More on inflation: he said it was expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our measures, rising wage growth etc He then repeats his usual call to governments to do more: To reap the ull benefits from monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute. Structural reform in euro area countries needs to be stepped up . On fiscal policies, the case is strengthened for rebuilding fiscal buffers, especially in in countries where debt remains high. Strengthening EMU remains a priority. Now for questions: Q: What will have to happen for the exchange rate to be a problem for the inflation target? And you said in December you would revisit guidance [on the bond buying programme] early this year? Draghi says there is confusion about the guidance comment, there was no difference between what was said at the December meeting and what Draghi said at the press conference. All that was said was there would have to be discussions about the need to have a discussion in the early part of the year. That discussion hasn\u2019t really started. We went through the events since October to now, trying to assess whether something has changed. There was not much of a change except the strengthening of the economy a little more than expected. By and large the risk to growth is balanced. We can\u2019t declare victory. Price pressures are muted. Underlying inflation is showing little signs of upward movement. So we simply restated policy. He said the commitment to the inflation target remained firmer than ever. Monetary policy will remain accommodative. On exchange rates he said there were three reasons for volatility. The improvement in the economy, the heightened market sensitivity to perceived changes in our communication. Finally the use of language in discussion exchange rate developments that doesn\u2019t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed in October in Washington [an agreement between governments on exchange rate policy] Q:Dollar weakness is what you were probably referring to. It must not be helpful to hear a lower dollar is something [US officials] like. Are we heading to currency war scenario. Also, could you envisage ending QE programme in September. We don\u2019t target exchange rates, they are important for growth and price stability. Movements justified by strength of economy are a fact of natiure. Are there other movements caused by use of language, not parts of terms agreed. Whether that has an effect on our inflation path...inflation is our main concern. Too early to assess whether pass through has already taken place, and what will be extent. Some are questioning the extent of pass through, but large exchange rate movements are bound to have an effect. In Washington - ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed] we will refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. On second question, we didn\u2019t have any discussion today, but we never stop the programme abruptly. Q: Will you give up you membership of the G30, after ombudsman letter? We received the letter from the ombudsman, we will respond in time. There is a procedure. We will assess the letter and the comments and respond. Q: German pay negotiations. Could there be broad pay increases across eurozone economy following Germany? We observe from a monetary policy angle, where we consider wage growth as a convincing sign of future inflation convergence to our objective. Whether it spreads, depends on conditions of labour market. Tight conditions in Germany, not so in other countries. Q: Are there financial stability risks from long term accommodative policy? Vice president Vitor Constancio answers. No one can talk about asset price bubbles in euro area. We have overstretched valuations in some places for commercial real estate, high yield corporate bonds but nothing else.... We see prices in market are close to fair value. Same is true of housing prices. Fundamental values are in line with fundamental. Prices of houses increasing by 4%, between 2000 and 2006 they were up 7%. So no general situation of overvaluation in residential properties. Some countries have also taken macroprudential policies to combat excesses. The effect on banks of negative rates, taking into account all our policies, they have been favourable to their profitability which is still low but increasing. So negative rates have been absorbed by banking sector. Draghi talks about fiscal buffers. Interest rates will at some point stop being so low. At that point all governments will want to have policy space, so budget consideration now when the time is good is favourable. NF We\u2019ve now got video footage of Theresa May and Donald Trump meeting. Trump says he and May have a mutual feeling of \u2018liking each other a lot\u201d. He says there have been a false rumour out there, which he wants to rebut. He tells May: We have great respect for everything you\u2019re doing, and we love your country. We think it\u2019s truly good. Trump says that the US and the UK are working on economic development, trade and military issues. We are very much joined at the hip when it comes to the military Theresa May\u2019s meeting with Trump is over - she\u2019s departed the scene without speaking to the press. Next up.... Israel\u2019s president Benjamin Netanyahu. He\u2019s gone up the stairs with a small group, presumably to meet Trump. Curiously, Theresa May and a few advisors came down from the Trump meeting.....vanished into another room...reappeared and then went back up again. OK, it looks like Trump and May have been holding their meeting - and it\u2019s nearly over.... White House reporters are travelling with Trump - here\u2019s one of the latest pooled reports: Pool arrived at 2:40 at the conference center after brief motorcade through town that includes some small souvenir shops, ski shops, restaurants. There were some JP Morgan flags posted on the route as well. The smattering of onlookers included a few waving American flags and some young kids in ski helmets. A few more photos of Trump\u2019s arrival: I managed a short video clip of Trump\u2019s arrival: President Trump and his entourage then move up the stairs, to a constant clicking of cameras. One delegate welcomes him to Switzerland. \u201cThank you very much. Great country.\u201d Trump replies. He then continues up another flight of stairs, to an area where most delegates (and journalists) aren\u2019t allowed. A security guard is now posted there to prevent any intruders. Trump arrives to his audience; reporters shout out a few questions. Asked what his message is to Davos, he replies \u201cPeace and prosperity\u201d. There are a few laughs. Here he comes...... The entire World Economic Forum has gone into a weird semi-lockdown. Half the delegates are crowding around, in a hush, waiting for Trump. The rest are milling around in the corridors and lounges, or getting on with business. Curiously, most delegates are waiting in silence..... President Trump is about to arrive at the World Economic Forum. People are crowding around the security cordon and flocking on the balcony , desperate for a glimpse. Theresa May ends her speech by calling on the World Economic Forum to work together to solve the problems she identified. The UK has a proud history of stepping up and delivering progress that can deliver for all, she says: Let\u2019s renew our commitment to collaboration - and set ourselves on a path to benefit all our people. Now, and for generations to come. That\u2019s it. No questions. Theresa May says technology companies employ some of the brightest minds in the world - they should be able to design a system where unacceptable content is deleted automatically. No-one wants to be known as a a platform for terrorism, or the best place for child pornography, she points out. She says there are three key priorities: Considering whether new regulations are needed for these tech platforms Investors must think about the social impact of the firms they invest in. Working on the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence Theresa May is now challenging social media companies to do more to protect users - especially children. We want Britain to be a \u201cWorld leader in innovation-friendly regulation\u201d she says (not the catchiest slogan). That means being the safest place in the world to be online, while also being a great place to run a digital business. Technology companies must \u201cstep up to their responsibilities\u201d, the PM says sternly. Companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery, or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content. Theresa May singles out Uber as an example of the potential,and problems, created by technology. It\u2019s an innovative company, but it has also got things wrong - with safety issues and concerns about its treatment of workers The solution isn\u2019t to shut them down, but to improve the system so companies work better. Employment law must protect workers and give businesses the flexibility it needs, says the PM - it can\u2019t just be a one-way street. Maybe 2/3 full was an overstatement.... May is pitching to businesses here, saying the government is raising Britain\u2019s digital skills for the 21st century. We\u2019re also at the forefront of low-carbon technologies, she declares. And on artificial intelligence, we\u2019re only at the beginning of what AI can achieve, says May. Those of you up here in Davos mustn\u2019t forget the plight of those who face losing their job after 20 years, says May. We must channel the power of business and government together to harness technology, and make it a force for good, May continues - to address people\u2019s concerns. I understand the power of business as a force for good. Free markets drive risk-taking that have delivered the great advances of our time. But I also believe in the power of government, she adds. Our new business strategy will make Britain one of the best place in the world to start and run a business, she pledges. Turning to technology, Theresa May says the internet can deliver $2.2 trillion worth of GDP to developing countries. And just last week, a drone saved two boys from drowning off Australia by carrying a float to them. Medical tests show that technology can reduce breast cancer cases by a third. But people are worried about the malevolent impact of technology, she says. Britain will continue to be an advocate of free trade after Brexit, May insists. And she challenges Davos delegates to live up to their commitments, in three ways: The commitments on steel must be implemented. Aid donors must match the UK and help developing countries The World Trade Organisation must do more to keep pace with the global economy - she singles out the service sector, and e-commerce Theresa May begins by saying that last year, she warned that the benefits of free trade weren\u2019t being shared fairly, and this risked undermining the global world order. One year on, there are grounds for optimism. Global growth is strengthening. The populism of the far left and far right has not made the progress some predicted, and in the UK, unemployment is at a 40-year low and government and business are working together well. Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, is introducing Theresa May now. The room is roughly two-thirds full - respectable, not as much as for president Macron last night. Schwab says many Davos attendees were impressed last year, by May\u2019s passionate plea to address global slavery. That work continues this year, he says. Cowbells are ringing across the Davos congress centre (yes, really), to tell delegates that Theresa May\u2019s speech starts soon. The hall is filling up well, but it\u2019s not packed out yet. One delegate tells me she\u2019s hoping to hear some clarity on Britain\u2019s future after Brexit. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty right now\u201d. At the CBI\u2019s lunch in Davos, Philip Hammond insisted that Britain would leave the EU on 31st March 2019. That\u2019s a statement of political reality, the chancellor insists. Hammond said Britain should go for something more ambitious than previous deals with the EU. An off-the-shelf Norway or Canada agreement won\u2019t work. Unusually for trade talks, we\u2019re starting from a point where we are already deeply interconnected with highly aligned regulatory systems and close co-operation on defence and security. Should go for something much more ambitious than anything that\u2019s previously been agreed. Former UK cabinet minister and New Labour architect Peter Mandelson was also at the lunch, and pointed out that French president Emmanuel Macron had hosted 140 CEOs at Versailles the other day. Mandelson warned: For France, Brexit is a gift that keeps on giving. Hammond hit back, though, saying you\u2019d get more top CEOs in London on an average day (probably not all meeting a world leader, though!). The European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged and repeated that its bond buying programme will run until September or beyond if necessary. The ECB added it could increase the programme from its current \u20ac30bn a month if circumstances change: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the asset purchase programme (APP) in terms of size and/or duration. On rates it said they would be kept at present levels \u201cfor an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.\u201d Of course the detail will come in president Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference this afternoon, when analysts will be looking for more on the future of the QE programme and when rates might rise. But Draghi must be tempted to keep his cards close to his chest, and avoid anything which could push the euro higher when inflation is still below the bank\u2019s target. NF Donald Trump and his team are staying at the Intercontinental Hotel in Davos. That\u2019s a sensible move from a security point of view; the Intercontinental is at the edge of Davos, rather than slap bang next to the conference centre like the Belvedere (scene of many parties and meeting). It\u2019s also up a steep hill, so easier to prevent protests . The White House press pack report that they saw onlookers snapping pictures of the Trump convoy, but no demos on the route. Hello... Business Insider\u2019s Paul Colgan has spotted some anti-Trump protesters outside the conference halls. There\u2019s very tight security all around the Davos area, making it hard for demonstrators to travel up the mountain and exercise their democratic rights. You\u2019d almost think the global elite didn\u2019t want to know what people really think of them.... Chancellor Philip Hammond is cracking some jokes at the CBI\u2019s lunch with British business chiefs - including one at Theresa May\u2019s expense. He reminds his audience that it was a walk in the mountain air that inspired the prime minister to call a general election last year*. I\u2019m discouraging her from taking any strolls, Hammond grins. * - (wiping out her majority) Boris Johnson once said that he was put off from visiting parts of New York by the very real risk of meeting Donald Trump. Well in Davos, you also run the very real risk of running into Piers Morgan. The UK journalist and TV personality has done well, though, securing an exclusive sit-down interview with the US president. It\u2019s due to air on Sunday night, with clips released on Friday morning. Davos delegates without a swanky lunch invite (or the time to go) are being fed individual jars of pasta dishes. And it\u2019s great fun to watch the global elite scrambling to over each other whenever the waiting staff emerge with a new tray of goodies. Your humble correspondent finally gets a pot, balances it on his iPad - and is promptly mistaken for a waiter by a fellow delegate who tries to nab it off me. Maybe it\u2019s time for a career change... Trump has touched down in Switzerland, but there\u2019s no sign of him in the Congress Hall yet. Ireland\u2019s leader, Leo Varadkar, is in Davos -- and refusing to accept that Apple got an unfairly good tax deal from the Irish government. In 2016, the EC ruled that Apple had received \u20ac13bn of state aid. Last November, it referred Ireland to the European Court of Justice because Dublin hadn\u2019t started reclaiming the cash. According to Varadkar, this process will start soon.....but he\u2019s not rolling over in the ECJ. Speaking of the CBI, UK retail sales have grown modestly in January so far, according to its latest distributive trades survey, but at a slower pace than anticipated. The survey showed a balance of +12 for January, down from +20 in December. Sales for the time of year were the weakest compared to the norm for more than four years, said the CBI. Orders to suppliers also fell, and looking ahead retailers expect similar growth in sales volumes while orders are forecast to be flat. Anna Leach, CBI head of economic intelligence, said: Retailers have seen fairly modest sales growth this month overall, but it is online retailers who have set the pace during the January sales. Household spending will remain under pressure this year from higher inflation and low wage growth, which will continue to weigh on sales growth in the retail sector. NF British business chiefs and media leaders have headed to a lunchtime event with chancellor Philip Hammond, hosted by the CBI. It\u2019s a traditional part of the Davos week for the UK delegation, but this year it could be a little frostier than usual. That\u2019s because CBI chief Caroline Fairbairn declared last week that Britain must remain in the customs union after Brexit. I imagine the Treasury weren\u2019t best pleased by this intervention (unless we\u2019ve outsourced Brexit negotiations to the CBI...a safer bet than using Carillion, anyway). But we understand that Hammond won\u2019t use his speech to rebut Fairbairn\u2019s call, and will cover other issues.... My colleague Larry Elliott\u2019s there, so we\u2019ll have more details soon.... Theresa May has given an interview to Bloomberg. She spoke about the revelations about sexual harassment at a charity dinner in London, saying: I was frankly appalled when I read the report of this Presidents Club event. I thought that that sort of attitude of the objectification of women was something that was in the past. Sadly, what that event showed is that there is still a lot more work for us to do. That chimes with Malala Yousafzai\u2019s comments this morning. Our Politics Live blog has more details: We hear that Theresa May\u2019s meeting with Donald Trump will take place shortly after her speech (which starts at 2pm, or 1pm GMT). It\u2019s likely to focus on foreign affairs issues like Syria and North Korea. Theresa May has now ended her private meeting (perhaps a roundtable?) and swept the WEF congress hall in a gaggle of aides. Down the stairs at pace, she\u2019s quickly into another secure section of this rabbit-warren of a building. Disappointingly she didn\u2019t stop for questions - a camera had been lined up, just in case. Still, we\u2019ll hear from her in a couple of hours. Chancellor Philip Hammond has told the Davos panel on financial risks that Europe will lose out if the City suffers after Brexit. New York and Singapore would benefit from new business, he says, not European cities. The idea that you can recreate London\u2019s financial centre anywhere else is a fantasy. Hammond also says that financial services are very important to the UK side, and \u201cthe centre of our negotiating strategy\u201d. Those who say the financial sector will not be part of a deal have not been looking at the numbers, he says. We have a trade deficit of \u00a3100bn with Europe, and a surplus in services of \u00a340bn, Hammond explains, adding: The only deal that can be done is one that can be fair to both parties One that included trade and not services would not be fair to the UK. Theresa May and her entourage have just swept through the Davos congress centre, into a private meeting room. Alas media are certainly not allowed in to listen. Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin is also on the panel on the future of finance. Yesterday, Mnuchin sent the dollar tumbling by saying a weak currency is good for exports. Today, he\u2019s very relaxed about the whole issue, saying: \u201cIn the short term where the dollar is is not a concern of mine. It is not something I spend a lot of time thinking about.\u201d Mnuchin also denies that America is trying to launch a trade war, insisting that the US doesn\u2019t want less trade it wants \u201cfair trade\u201d. The big debate on financial stability is also underway. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, says trade is one of the factors leading to stronger growth. When asked about the risks of a trade war, she says: \u201cWho would want to do anything that would lead to weaker growth? Al Gore, former US vice-president, has suggested that Donald Trump can\u2019t disrupt the battle against climate change - especially if he isn\u2019t reelected in 2020. Speaking on a panel here in Davos, Gore says there is strong momentum to fight climate change. Several governors of our largest states, hundreds of cities, and thousands of US businesses are now ensuring that the US will not just meet, but exceed, the commitments it made in the Paris Agreement. Gore explains that America can\u2019t legally leave the Paris Agreement (to act to limit rising global temperatures) until after the next presidential election. And if there\u2019s a new president (at which point Al Gore offers a silent prayer), they could give 30 days notice and America would be back in the agreement. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news, Gore says, is that the maximum action that is political feasible falls far short of the minimum of what is needed to battle climate change. So, we need to move the boundary of what politicians can do. You can watch the panel live, here. Back in the UK, and mortgage approvals by Britain\u2019s banks fell to their lowest level since April 2013 in December, according to trade association UK Finance. Banks approved 36,115 mortgages for housebuying, down from 39,007 in November and 19% lower than a year ago. Annual growth in consumer credit slipped from 0.8% to 0.7%. And this could give the Bank of England a problem: NF Newsflash: Theresa May has met with South Africa\u2019s deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa.....and there\u2019s not a fondue dish in sight either. Theresa May\u2019s former press chief has caused a stir this morning, accusing the PM of spending last year\u2019s Davos \u201csitting in a hotel eating fondue\u201d rather than meeting fellow world leaders and business chiefs. Writing in The Times, Katy Perrior claims the PM struggled to schmooze at the 2017 World Economic Forum, and even turned up with the wrong sort of footwear (her new \u00a3120 snowboots should work better this time). Perrior claiming business leaders were frozen out by May: \u2018Elsewhere they get personal audiences with President Macron in France and Malcolm Turnbull in Australia but not so much as a digestive biscuit from the PM. \u2018Does she have any idea how frustrating that is for them? Other world leaders are on a charm offensive, desperate to woo major businesses to their shores. \u2018As we count down to post-Brexit Britain, she would do well to spend less time enjoying the fondue and more time meeting and greeting.\u2019 More here. Personally, I was disappointed not to see May meeting business chiefs and academics at Oxford University\u2019s excellent Davos cheese and port party last night (maybe I left too early #bestbehaviour ) Perrior also claims May turned down the chance to meet Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma last year. He\u2019s still at Davos, so there\u2019s still time to make amends, prime minister... Kristin Lemkau, JP Morgan\u2019s chief marketing officer, sums up Davos so far: Sterling continues to go from strength to strength. In Asia overnight it hit $1.4328, and although it has eased back from that, it is still up 0.11% so far today at $1.4255. It is partly the expectation of an earlier than expected UK rate rise, given the recent strong data including Wednesday\u2019s employment and wages figures. But of course there is also the weak dollar, hit recently by the expectation that Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts would raise the already hefty US deficit. More immediately Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told Davos the US wasn\u2019t worried about a flagging greenback. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: Steven Mnuchin (US Treasury Secretary) went to Davos and said that a weaker dollar \u2018is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities\u2019. He also pointed out that that he isn\u2019t concerned by where it is in the short term and that in the longer term, its strength is a reflection of the strength of the US economy. In other words, he said very little really, but he said it under snow-plastered slopes and he was speaking to a market where dollar bulls have been under the cosh. A few more capitulated. Against the euro the pound is pretty flat, down just 0.01% at \u20ac1.1473 ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting. But the euro is up against the dollar, 0.11% better at $1.2421. The strength of the euro presents a problem for ECB president Mario Draghi. If he appears too bulllish at hinting at an end to the bank\u2019s QE programme, the euro will appreciate even further. And that would keep a lid on inflation which is already below the bank\u2019s target. Equally, he cannot ignore the improving European economy. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets explains: With headline inflation remaining well below its 2% target rate at 1.4% and an economy that continues to show decent levels of economic activity the ECB is faced with having to navigate the minefield of guiding markets over the tightrope of communicating a credible timeline for stimulus reduction and interest rate policy, while trying to move CPI back to target against the difficulty of a rising currency. Since the beginning of 2017 the euro has risen 18% against the US dollar and could well rise even further given yesterday\u2019s remarks by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. Last week ECB vice president Vitor Constancio along with Austria\u2019s Ewald Nowotny expressed concern about recent exchange rate movements. These concerns are likely to have increased in recent days which will make today\u2019s press conference by ECB President Mario Draghi much more interesting. He can\u2019t very well ignore the improving outlook but if he comes across as too bullish the euro could well be well on the way to the 1.3000 level by the end of this quarter. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: Draghi would have to adopt a delicate approach and seek a strategy which stops the euro from firming further. The only way out of this situation for him would be to emphasize that the process of the rate hikes is not within sight yet. The market is expecting a rate hike in 2019 from the ECB, Draghi would have to pull a rabbit out of hat in order to convince the market that rate hike isn\u2019t on the agenda and market participants are getting ahead of themselves. We do think that overly dovish statement by the European central bank is priced in the euro to some extent. If Draghi fails to convince the market or if he doesn\u2019t sound as dovish as the market is expecting, we think that the euro can take off from here. I think the risk to the downside for the euro are limited, it is the upside move which would be more exciting. NF Theresa May\u2019s Conservative Party has confirmed she will hold social media giants to account in Davos: Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of Lloyd\u2019s, says that companies are taking out more insurance against cyber attacks. \u201cIt is the fastest growing part of our business\u201d, Carnegie-Brown says, adding: \u201cCompanies are certainly becoming more concerned about the risks.\u201d Lloyd\u2019s has 30% of the global market, Carnegie-Brown says, with 85% of the business coming from US firms. The insurance market is changing, he says. \u201cPeople are more concerned about cyber attack than a fire when it comes to the potential impact on their business.\u201d Carnegie-Brown says he has been floating the idea in Davos that governments might use part of their aid budgets to insure poor developing countries against the cost of natural disasters. Lloyd\u2019s will pay out almost $5b to the US states affected by the three hurricanes last year but says the world as a whole is under-insured. Malala also warns that world leaders need to invest more in education, to help future generations. Malala Yousafzai, the world\u2019s youngest Nobel Prize winner, is speaking at Davos right now, about the importance of giving girls equal rights to education. She\u2019s explaining that education can play a key role in improving giving the message of equality. So what\u2019s your message to Trump on the issue of gender equality, asks Miriam Elder of Buzzfeed. Yousafzai says: I get so disappointed to see that people in these high positions openly talk against women, do not accept women as equals, they harass woman. It is just shocking to think that is is happening I hope that women stand up and speak out against it. I hope that people who are involved in such shameful things think about their own daughters, their own mothers, their own close female relations, and just imagine for a second, could they let it happen to them? I don\u2019t think they would accept that. Malala, who was shot by the Taliban in 2012 after campaigning for girls education, says women must \u201craise up their voice\u201d, and reach the ears and minds of those who still hold views which we hoped didn\u2019t exist any more Just in: chancellor Philip Hammond says he\u2019s \u201cvery happy\u201d with the strength of sterling, which has hit its highest level since the Brexit vote. Foreign exchange rates are a big story at Davos, after America\u2019s Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin seemed to hint that Washington liked a weaker dollar Some of President\u2019s Trump\u2019s top officials are briefing the press again this morning. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross is in combative mood, denying that America is protectionist - even though it just slapped new tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from Asia. Ross also says that America is \u201cmore interested\u201d in bilateral trade deals than multilateral ones - which doesn\u2019t bode very well for the ongoing NAFTA negotiations. John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, is also in Davos, and bringing a warning for the global elite: McDonnell will be telling top business people and world leaders that they\u2019re dangerously insulated from the problems outside WEF\u2019s security cordon and swanky parties: \u201cMany of those attending the World Economic Forum have been patting themselves on the back as international growth figures have begun to pick up. \u201cBut they should be worried. In the real world, outside the Davos bubble of Alpine restaurants and chalets, the global economic system they have built isn\u2019t working for billions of people. \u201cAnd just as Davos faces the risk of an avalanche this week, growth for a few risks a political and social avalanche unless there is fundamental change to our rigged economic system. Philip Hammond, the UK\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, is also at Davos. He\u2019s been giving his views about artificial intelligence at a Microsoft breakfast, saying: \u201cWe are at the point where computers move from being dumb and fast to being smart and fast.\u201d Hammond says AI is going to be disruptive and managing the process is the key to it being accepted, warning: \u201cTo many it will seem to be a big threat to their prosperity and livelihoods\u201d. Losers would include members of the middle class but it was important to embrace the new technology rather than resist it. \u201cLet\u2019s not create a generation of 21st Century Luddites who feel the only chance of survival is to resist change.\u201d Hammond said AI would affect the jobs market, would disrupt business models and had ethical dimensions including privacy and the way new technology could be used in wars. \u201cThe choice is simple: do we look inward or outward, look to the future or cleave to the past?\u201d Here are some photos of Donald Trump setting off to Davos last night: Good morning from Davos. It\u2019s another big day at the World Economic Forum, with Theresa May giving a keynote speech this afternoon \u2013 and meeting Donald Trump on the sidelines. The UK PM is expected to put technology giants under pressure to clean up their act and tackle extreme content. She\u2019ll say: Investors can make a big difference here by ensuring trust and safety issues are being properly considered. And I urge them to do so. These companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content.\u201d Her meeting with Trump will be a chance to talk trade after Brexit, discuss terrorism, and perhaps patch up that Special Relationship after the row over the US embassy. As Beth Rigby from Sky News puts it: The two leaders are expected to focus on areas where there is common ground in international affairs: North Korea, as well as eradicating Islamic State in Syria and northern Iraq. They might touch on Iran. But the thornier issue of Russian aggression in Europe is less likely to be raised as the Prime Minister seeks to soothe relations and not stoke further tensions. President Trump set off for Davos last night - part of the biggest US delegation ever. We\u2019ll be hearing more from his team this morning. There\u2019s also masses of other events, covering gender equality, financial stability, tax avoidance and climate change. Here are some highlights coming up today 9am Davos (8am UK): Malala Yousafzai on girls education 9.15am Davos: Debate: could rogue technology kill us all? 10.30am Davos: A speech by King Abdullah II of Jordan 11am Davos: Debate: How should leaders fighting climate change, with Greenpeace boss Jennifer Morgan and Al Gore 11am Davos: Debate: How to remake global finance, with IMF chief Christine Lagarde, chancellor Philip Hammond, US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, Larry Fink 2pm Davos: Special address by prime minister Theresa May 3pm Davos: Debate: Beyond the Paradise Papers: Can Global Tax Avoidance Be Stopped? 4pm Davos: A speech by Benjamin Netanyahu 6pm Davos: Are cryptocurrencies going to cause a financial crisis? 6.30pm Davos: A debate on global warming",

Commodities are priced in dollars and could effect inflation data.</em></p> \n  <p>When we recalibrated programme last October we had a discussion whether it should be six or nine months, and how much.

What level of concern was there today about a possible change in US policy [after US dollar comments]</em></p> \n  <p>Yes there was concern. It was broader than simply the exchange rate, but about broader state of international relations right now. If this leads to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy we would have to think about our monetary policy strategy.</p> \n  <p>On communications, you see same thing in other jurisdictions. All the communiations since Dec have in common three characteristics. All based on commitment to objective of inflation target. None questioned the sequence whereby interest rates will stay at current levels well past end of asset buying programme. Well past was emphasised.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Some commentators factoring in an interest rate rise this year? At its current level does euro reflect fundamentals?</em></p> \n  <p>Based on today\u2019s data I see very few chances at all that interest rates can be raised this year. On euro, we should ask is it produced by strength of economy, or by statements, or by monetary policy elsewhere. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: Another question on the G30 membership, could it compromise ECB?</em></p> \n  <p>Draghi repeats his previous answer, but adds ombudsman said there was no evidence the meeting influenced ECB, and ECB must have contacts with other financial participants.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Will differences of views within ECB deepen on exit strategy? At March meeting, will you give restatement of forward guidance.</em></p> \n  <p>I don\u2019t think the differences are as substantive as they were on other occasions. Some are a little more confident, if they live where inflation is rising. But there are not deep existential differences.</p> \n  <p>But there may be differences on when to say certain things, when to move forward. Markets have expectations on path, but also on dates, timelines. </p> \n  <p>In March we will assess how things stand at that point in time.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a69d9b0e4b00f225a1c7a86\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T15:06:10.845Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB: Draghi press conference</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Away from Davis briefly and back with the ECB, and president Mario Draghi said at his press conference that domestic price pressures remained muted, inflation has yet to show a convincing upward trend.</p> \n  <p>He said the recent foreign exchange volatility is a source of uncertainty. An ample degree of monetary stimulus is necessary.</p> \n  <p>On the economy, he said there could be positive growth surprise in the near term. But there were downside risks remain relating to global factors, forex.</p> \n  <p>More on inflation: he said it was expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our measures, rising wage growth etc</p> \n  <p>He then repeats his usual call to governments to do more: To reap the ull benefits from monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute. Structural reform in euro area countries needs to be stepped up . On fiscal policies, the case is strengthened for rebuilding fiscal buffers, especially in in countries where debt remains high. Strengthening EMU remains a priority.</p> \n  <p>Now for questions:</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What will have to happen for the exchange rate to be a problem for the inflation target? And you said in December you would revisit guidance [on the bond buying programme] early this year?</em></p> \n  <p>Draghi says there is confusion about the guidance comment, there was no difference between what was said at the December meeting and what Draghi said at the press conference. All that was said was there would have to be discussions about the need to have a discussion in the early part of the year. That discussion hasn\u2019t really started. We went through the events since October to now, trying to assess whether something has changed. There was not much of a change except the strengthening of the economy a little more than expected. By and large the risk to growth is balanced.</p> \n  <p>We can\u2019t declare victory. Price pressures are muted. Underlying inflation is showing little signs of upward movement. So we simply restated policy.</p> \n  <p>He said the commitment to the inflation target remained firmer than ever. Monetary policy will remain accommodative.</p> \n  <p>On exchange rates he said there were three reasons for volatility. The improvement in the economy, the heightened market sensitivity to perceived changes in our communication. Finally the use of language in discussion exchange rate developments that doesn\u2019t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed in October in Washington [an agreement between governments on exchange rate policy]</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a263a300171d6e4db1e16a9fb5d2f56b0fed19e9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a263a300171d6e4db1e16a9fb5d2f56b0fed19e9/27_0_750_450/500.jpg\" alt=\"newdraghi25\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Draghi at the press conference</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ECB</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p><em>Q:Dollar weakness is what you were probably referring to. It must not be helpful to hear a lower dollar is something [US officials] like. Are we heading to currency war scenario. Also, could you envisage ending QE programme in September.</em></p> \n  <p>We don\u2019t target exchange rates, they are important for growth and price stability. </p> \n  <p>Movements justified by strength of economy are a fact of natiure. Are there other movements caused by use of language, not parts of terms agreed. Whether that has an effect on our inflation path...inflation is our main concern. Too early to assess whether pass through has already taken place, and what will be extent.</p> \n  <p>Some are questioning the extent of pass through, but large exchange rate movements are bound to have an effect. In Washington - ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed] we will refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target exchange rates for competitive purposes.</p> \n  <p>On second question, we didn\u2019t have any discussion today, but we never stop the programme abruptly.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Will you give up you membership of the G30, after ombudsman letter?</em></p> \n  <p>We received the letter from the ombudsman, we will respond in time. There is a procedure. We will assess the letter and the comments and respond.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: German pay negotiations. Could there be broad pay increases across eurozone economy following Germany?</em></p> \n  <p>We observe from a monetary policy angle, where we consider wage growth as a convincing sign of future inflation convergence to our objective. Whether it spreads, depends on conditions of labour market. Tight conditions in Germany, not so in other countries.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Are there financial stability risks from long term accommodative policy? </em></p> \n  <p>Vice president Vitor Constancio answers. No one can talk about asset price bubbles in euro area. We have overstretched valuations in some places for commercial real estate, high yield corporate bonds but nothing else.... We see prices in market are close to fair value. Same is true of housing prices. Fundamental values are in line with fundamental. Prices of houses increasing by 4%, between 2000 and 2006 they were up 7%. So no general situation of overvaluation in residential properties.</p> \n  <p>Some countries have also taken macroprudential policies to combat excesses.</p> \n  <p>The effect on banks of negative rates, taking into account all our policies, they have been favourable to their profitability which is still low but increasing. So negative rates have been absorbed by banking sector.</p> \n  <p>Draghi talks about fiscal buffers. Interest rates will at some point stop being so low. At that point all governments will want to have policy space, so budget consideration now when the time is good is favourable.</p> \n  <p><strong>NF</strong></p> \n  <p><em><br></em></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T15:13:52.990Z\">at 3.13pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5a69eea8e4b0473d0bc103bd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-25T14:55:44.193Z\">2.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump: We love Britain</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>We\u2019ve now got video footage of Theresa May and Donald Trump meeting.</strong></p> \n  <p>Trump says he and May have a mutual feeling of \u2018liking each other a lot\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He says there have been a false rumour out there, which he wants to rebut.</p> \n  <p>He tells May:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have great respect for everything you\u2019re doing, and we love your country.

In Asia overnight it hit $1.4328, and although it has eased back from that, it is still up 0.11% so far today at $1.4255.</p> \n  <p>It is partly the expectation of an earlier than expected UK rate rise, given the recent strong data including Wednesday\u2019s employment and wages figures. But of course there is also the weak dollar, hit recently by the expectation that Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts would raise the already hefty US deficit. More immediately Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told Davos the US wasn\u2019t worried about a flagging greenback. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Steven Mnuchin (US Treasury Secretary) went to Davos and said that a weaker dollar \u2018is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities\u2019. He also pointed out that that he isn\u2019t concerned by where it is in the short term and that in the longer term, its strength is a reflection of the strength of the US economy. In other words, he said very little really, but he said it under snow-plastered slopes and he was speaking to a market where dollar bulls have been under the cosh. A few more capitulated.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Against the euro the pound is pretty flat, down just 0.01% at \u20ac1.1473 ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting. But the euro is up against the dollar, 0.11% better at $1.2421.</p> \n  <p>The strength of the euro presents a problem for ECB president Mario Draghi. If he appears too bulllish at hinting at an end to the bank\u2019s QE programme, the euro will appreciate even further. And that would keep a lid on inflation which is already below the bank\u2019s target. Equally, he cannot ignore the improving European economy. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets explains:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>With headline inflation remaining well below its 2% target rate at 1.4% and an economy that continues to show decent levels of economic activity the ECB is faced with having to navigate the minefield of guiding markets over the tightrope of communicating a credible timeline for stimulus reduction and interest rate policy, while trying to move CPI back to target against the difficulty of a rising currency. </p> \n   <p>Since the beginning of 2017 the euro has risen 18% against the US dollar and could well rise even further given yesterday\u2019s remarks by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.<strong> </strong></p> \n   <p>Last week ECB vice president Vitor Constancio along with Austria\u2019s Ewald Nowotny expressed concern about recent exchange rate movements. These concerns are likely to have increased in recent days which will make today\u2019s press conference by ECB President Mario Draghi much more interesting. He can\u2019t very well ignore the improving outlook but if he comes across as too bullish the euro could well be well on the way to the 1.3000 level by the end of this quarter.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Draghi would have to adopt a delicate approach and seek a strategy which stops the euro from firming further. The only way out of this situation for him would be to emphasize that the process of the rate hikes is not within sight yet. The market is expecting a rate hike in 2019 from the ECB, Draghi would have to pull a rabbit out of hat in order to convince the market that rate hike isn\u2019t on the agenda and market participants are getting ahead of themselves.</p> \n   <p>We do think that overly dovish statement by the European central bank is priced in the euro to some extent.

It is an interesting experiment, but it\u2019s not a permanent feature of our lives,\u201d said Shiller, who has previously warned that the bitcoin price could collapse. \u201cWe are over-emphasising bitcoin, we should expand it out to blockchain, which will have other applications.\u201d Theresa May said in Davos that she was concerned that criminals were taking advantage of digital currencies, which can be used to anonymously transfer funds. \u201cIn areas like cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, we should be looking at these very seriously,\u201d May told Bloomberg. The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, also flagged up concerns about misuse of digital currencies. \u201cMy number one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they\u2019re not used for illicit activities,\u201d Mnuchin told CNBC. \u201cSo in the US our regulations [say] if you\u2019re a bitcoin wallet, you\u2019re subject to the same regulations as a bank.\u201d South Korea has recently announced a clampdown on digital currencies. From next month, people will be banned from using anonymous bank accounts for cryptocurrency trading. Digital currencies have been a key topic of conversation at Davos. Ethereum, a rival to bitcoin, has set up its own lounge on the main promenade of the ski resort. Banks are showing particular interest in the blockchain \u2013 the digital ledger that underpins a cryptocurrency. A senior Swedish central banker said bitcoin was too volatile to be classed as money. \u201cIn my view, cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and the others, the way I\u2019ve seen them so far, they don\u2019t meet the criteria to be called money,\u201d said Cecilia Skingsley, deputy governor of the Riksbank. \u201cThey are not a very stable store of value \u2013 they fluctuate a lot \u2013 and it\u2019s not a very efficient medium of exchange because you don\u2019t buy your groceries with bitcoin, you don\u2019t get your salaries in bitcoin, and you certainly can\u2019t pay your taxes with bitcoin.\u201d Skingsley said she understood that digital currencies were attractive in countries where people did not trust the public authorities, but she said bitcoin was a \u201cpoor alternative\u201d as it was too volatile. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking of money in an efficient economy, over time it\u2019s much better if you have a trustworthy authority that releases enough money \u2013 not too little and not too much,\u201d Skingsley said. However, some investors at Davos disputed the idea that bitcoin faced a rocky future. Jennifer Zhu Scott, of Radian Partners, said bitcoin was a \u201cvery lousy currency\u201d and a \u201cvery lousy payment system\u201d but insisted that it worked as an asset. \u201cI don\u2019t think bitcoin is disrupting currency or money. Bitcoin is disrupting gold,\u201d she said. Zhu argued that bitcoin was extremely efficient as a store of value, as there could only ever be 21m in circulation \u2013 and only about 16m have been created so far. Neil Rimer, a general partner at Index Ventures, conceded that bitcoin could theoretically crash to zero, but he also hailed the progress since it was created nine years ago. \u201cThis is one of the most audacious, generous and profound inventions that I have witnessed in my career. It does have the ability to help many, many people,\u201d he said.",

The retailer\u2019s UK sales climbed 23% to break through \u00a3300m in the last four months of 2017 as its legion of young shoppers headed to the site for party outfits and gifts. The Asos chief executive, Nick Beighton, said the option for customers to pay only for items they keep rather than pay for an an entire order up front and then wait for a refund on returned items had helped it win sales in a challenging market. \u201cTwentysomethings play their debit and credit card cashflows, so being able to try on fashion without being charged is a much better scenario for them.\u201d Clothing websites like Asos and Boohoo are winning market share from established high street retailers by tapping in to a generation of consumers who shop on their mobile phones and take their style cues from social media. At Boohoo sales doubled at Christmas, whereas sales fell at Marks &amp; Spencer, the UK\u2019s biggest clothing retailer, and rival Next managed only a small rise. Asos\u2019s UK sales climbed 23% to \u00a3300.9m while international sales soared 35% to \u00a3489.5m. Asos shares, which debuted at 20p in 2001, closed up 3% at \u00a370.80. They have increased by a third over the last year, a gain that has seen it overtake the market value of the 134-year-old Marks &amp; Spencer. Beighton said Asos handled 20.2m orders over the four-month period, which was 30% up on 2016. Customers also spent 3% more per order. Sofie Willmott, an analyst at GlobalData, said Asos stood out as of one of the biggest retail success stories of Christmas 2017. \u201cAsos continues to streak ahead of its multichannel competitors. Its agility and willingness to adapt to changing shopping habits coupled with its confidence to invest in new initiatives are key contributors to its ongoing success.\u201d However, she added: \u201cThough Asos is seemingly untouchable with double-digit UK growth the norm, the retailer must remain aware of smaller young fashion online pure plays such as Boohoo, Missguided and lesser-known brands like SilkFred and Missy Empire, who are creeping up and vying for a larger share of shopper spend.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Fracking companies must undergo financial health checks if they want to win a green light for their operations, the business secretary has said, as the industry faces another barrier to exploration in the UK. The decision comes after a Barclays-backed company hoping to be the first to frack in the UK for seven years suffered a blow when the business secretary, Greg Clark, said he was withholding consent because of the state of its accounts. Third Energy is ready to start extracting gas at Kirby Misperton in North Yorkshire and is awaiting permission from Clark. But on Thursday, the business secretary said no decision would be made until Third Energy submitted overdue accounts and the Treasury had assessed its financial resilience, including the firm\u2019s ability to clean up the site afterwards. The operating company, Third Energy UK Gas, has overdue accounts for the period ending 31 December 2016. They were due last September. Clark said that the contents of the accounts would inform his decision on whether to give the company the go-ahead, as he conceded the firm had passed 13 other technical tests. Fracking involves pumping a mixture of water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped gas \u2013 a technique that critics say could poison water supplies and cause earth tremors. Clark added that new financial checks would now be applied to other companies seeking a consent, such as Cuadrilla and Ineos, adding an extra hoop for frackers to jump through. Clark said: \u201cThe government considers that the financial resilience of a company wishing to hydraulically fracture is a relevant consideration. As a matter of policy, we will therefore look at the financial resilience of all companies wishing to carry out hydraulic fracturing operations alongside their application for hydraulic fracturing consent.\u201d Third Energy said: \u201cOur annual accounts are being finalised and we will now be working with the Infrastructure and Projects Authority and the Oil and Gas Authority towards achieving hydraulic fracturing consent from the secretary of state.\u201d Fracking companies have already been delayed by new regulations imposed by government in recent years, in the wake of a moratorium. It is not clear how serious an impediment new financial tests will be. One shale industry source said: \u201cUntil we know what the process is and what [the government] need, it\u2019s hard to know the impact.\u201d Alan Linn, director at Third Energy, recently told the Guardian: \u201cWe are financed to complete our existing round of work. Then we will go out and do our next round of financing.\u201d Linn was officially announced as the company\u2019s director this week. He replaced John Dewar, who had worked as director at Third Energy since 2011 and has called the Kirby Misperton project his \u201ccrowning glory\u201d. The company\u2019s chairman, Keith Cochrane, was also interim chief executive at construction firm Carillion, which went into liquidation earlier this month. Fracking opponents said the intervention by Clark was a blow to the industry. Caroline Lucas, Green party co-leader and a long-term critic of shale gas extraction who was arrested at anti-fracking protests in 2013, said: \u201cFracking is doomed, despite the industry\u2019s desperation to start drilling. \u201cThis latest news reveals another reason to distrust the fracking firms \u2013 they can\u2019t even get their financial house in order. It\u2019s absolutely right that Third Energy are being forced to sort themselves out.\u201d Barclays invested in the company through a private equity divisionthat was later spun out, but retains a shareholding. The bank said last year it planned to sell its stake.",

      "bodyText": "An hour before Theresa May took to the stage in Davos, Philip Hammond stood up to speak to the British business leaders lunch, an annual fixture at the World Economic Forum. \u201cIt was a walk in the mountain air that inspired the prime minister to call a general election, so I am discouraging her from taking any strolls,\u201d the chancellor quipped. The crack duly got the laugh it was expecting, but exposed a brutal truth: a year on from her Davos debut as prime minister, May is a much diminished figure in the eyes of the people who run the UK\u2019s biggest companies. Downing Street considered May\u2019s 24 hours in Davos a success: she delivered a serious speech; she spent the morning in private conversations about the importance of new technology; she was the first leader to hold a bilateral with Donald Trump; and there were no embarrassing moments. But something was not quite right. The sort of world leaders that go down well in Davos either display strength, vision or charm; and those that go down a storm radiate all three. May\u2019s authority has been sapped by the loss of the government\u2019s overall majority at last June\u2019s election. She has never been able to make her idea of \u201ca country that works for everyone\u201d sing. And while she tried hard, she did not feel at ease in Davos and it showed. The story told by her former press adviser Katie Perrior about how she preferred to sit in her hotel room and eat fondue rather than take up the offer of a meeting with Jack Ma, the Chinese billionaire who founded the Alibaba conglomerate, spoke volumes. As if told by her advisers that she needed to make more of an effort this year, the prime minister showed up at the reception held by Aberdeen Asset Management on Wednesday night, which with its malt whiskies and a piper playing Scotland the Brave outside was a nice, safe option. On one of Cameron\u2019s visits to Davos, he bunked off with George Osborne and Boris Johnson for a pizza. Twelve months ago, May was a big draw in Davos. It was seven months after the Brexit vote and the UK had yet to trigger article 50. For the attendees at Davos, May was an unknown quantity and there was genuine interest in who she was, what she stood for and how she intended to proceed with Britain\u2019s EU divorce. A year on, the hall was only two-thirds full to hear May speak, and her 30-minute address was considered worthy but dull. Most leaders prefer to sit on stage in an armchair while Klaus Schwab, the founder of Davos, butters them up. May opted for the formal approach, waiting off stage until Schwab had finished his spiel. Inevitably, unflattering comparisons were made with Emmanuel Macron who had played to a packed house the night before. Macron\u2019s message to Davos was simple: France is back. Those who turned up to listen to May talk about artificial intelligence were left scratching their heads at the absence of a big-picture vision. \u201cTo be honest with you, I was a bit disappointed,\u201d said one Swiss businesswoman. \u201cShe talked about AI, which is important and interesting, but I wanted to hear something about Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU. There was a very large elephant in the room.\u201d The Hammond lunch took place at the Belvedere hotel, the social hub of Davos. May appeared at the drinks\u2019 reception beforehand to press the flesh for 15 minutes. It was something that would have come as second nature to her predecessor but it was hard work for May and something she did not relish. \u201cShe is not a natural leader,\u201d said one industry figure. \u201cShe is like a chief executive who doesn\u2019t command his board. She is weak and can\u2019t control the cabinet.\u201d Another chief executive, extremely unhappy about the idea of a hard Brexit, said the prime minister should take a tougher line with her foreign secretary. \u201cShe needs to start leading from the front, to do what\u2019s best for the country and not care what Boris says or does.\u201d A straw poll of executives at the lunch suggested that executives, many of whom donate money to the Conservative party, have some sympathy for the prime minister. \u201cShe is clearly a decent person but she is painfully shy,\u201d one City figure said. \u201cI feel sorry for her.\u201d For May, the good news is that business doesn\u2019t hate her. The bad news is that they pity her. For a prime minister, that\u2019s worse.",

Dead time between a cheese fondue and the excitement of Donald Trump\u2019s arrival, when the world\u2019s political and business leaders \u2013 along with a healthy smattering of tax exiles and hangers on \u2013 get to catch up on a few zeds. So who better to fill it than the British prime minister? Someone with the unique ability to put even hyperactive seven-year-olds to sleep. The main hall was barely half full when Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum\u2019s founder and executive chairman, welcomed Theresa May to the platform. It was even emptier by the time she had finished her speech 25 minutes later. There\u2019s only so much punishment some people can take even in the pursuit of oblivion. Theresa began by reminding everyone of what she had said in her speech last year. That the rich and powerful risked losing popular support if their policies weren\u2019t seen to benefit their countries. In the front row, Philip Hammond, Liam Fox and Matt Hancock all winced. They needed no such reminder. They had a leader who had taken for granted a 20-point lead in the polls and had lost her overall majority in the general election. Still, no one could accuse the prime minister of not knowing what she was talking about. After going on to talk a bit about Britain\u2019s industrial strategy and her hopes for businesses in Hull \u2013 of limited interest to those who had mainly turned up in the hope she might have some new thoughts about Brexit \u2013 Theresa chose to make it personal. She wanted to talk about something dear to her heart, something that motivated her. Quite literally. The benefits of artificial intelligence. Robots were good. Robots were the way forward. Yes it was true that the technology was still very much in its infancy. Speech-recognition programmes still left a lot to be desired, the Maybot observed in her all-too-familiar mechanical, disengaged delivery. She was very much looking forward to a time when she wouldn\u2019t be speaking as if English were a second language, but it would be helpful if more people could acknowledge her pioneering work in using AI in public service delivery. Just to demonstrate the advances her programmers were making in this area, Theresa moved one arm up and down in time with her lips. The audience was still not impressed. They had seen more intelligent AI at a toy trade fair in Korea and the applause lasted less than 10 seconds. There was rather more interest in the three-minute press conference that Theresa had with Trump ahead of their bilateral meeting in the afternoon. It was the Donald who did most of the talking, leaving the prime minister looking on like a near-silent, awkward, animatronic bot. \u201cWe\u2019re on the same wavelength in, I think, every respect,\u201d Trump said. The prime minister looked anxious. She sincerely hoped not, otherwise she was in more trouble than she thought. Trump ploughed on. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that will happen to you that we won\u2019t be there for you,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you to know that.\u201d It wasn\u2019t clear if he was planning to be there for her personally or Britain. Both, possibly. Theresa tried to look pleased at the prospect. \u201cThere are going to be many great increases in trade, tremendous increases in trade,\u201d he went on, thereby contradicting his former promises to put America first. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a great discussion,\u201d Theresa said neutrally, finally getting a word in edgeways and trying to wrap things up. The press conference ended in chaos with dozens of reporters shouting questions at the same time. A flicker of relief crossed her face. Better to be a Maybot than a pussy-grabbing stable genius any day of the week.",

There\u2019s only so much punishment some people can take even in the pursuit of oblivion.</p> <p>Theresa began by reminding everyone of what she had said in her speech last year. That the rich and powerful risked losing popular support if their policies weren\u2019t seen to benefit their countries. In the front row, Philip Hammond, Liam Fox and Matt Hancock all winced. They needed no such reminder. They had a leader who had taken for granted a 20-point lead in the polls and had lost her overall majority in the general election. Still, no one could accuse the prime minister of not knowing what she was talking about.</p> <p>After going on to talk a bit about Britain\u2019s industrial strategy and her hopes for businesses in Hull \u2013 of limited interest to those who had mainly turned up in the hope she might have some new thoughts about Brexit \u2013 Theresa chose to make it personal. She wanted to talk about something dear to her heart, something that motivated her. Quite literally. The benefits of artificial intelligence.</p> <p>Robots were good. Robots were the way forward. Yes it was true that the technology was still very much in its infancy. Speech-recognition programmes still left a lot to be desired, the Maybot observed in her all-too-familiar mechanical, disengaged delivery. She was very much looking forward to a time when she wouldn\u2019t be speaking as if English were a second language, but it would be helpful if more people could acknowledge her pioneering work in using AI in public service delivery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d13509501710bc00ba3804e91c93cafd11613a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d13509501710bc00ba3804e91c93cafd11613a9/0_223_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May addresses the World Economic Forum in Davos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa moved one arm up and down in time with her lips ... the audience was still not impressed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just to demonstrate the advances her programmers were making in this area, Theresa moved one arm up and down in time with her lips. The audience was still not impressed. They had seen more intelligent AI at a toy trade fair in Korea and the applause lasted less than 10 seconds.</p> <p>There was rather more interest in the three-minute press conference that Theresa had with Trump ahead of their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/25/trump-and-may-discuss-uk-visit-later-this-year-davos\">bilateral meeting</a> in the afternoon. It was the Donald who did most of the talking, leaving the prime minister looking on like a near-silent, awkward, animatronic bot. \u201cWe\u2019re on the same wavelength in, I think, every respect,\u201d Trump said. The prime minister looked anxious. She sincerely hoped not, otherwise she was in more trouble than she thought.</p> <p>Trump ploughed on. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that will happen to you that we won\u2019t be there for you,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you to know that.\u201d It wasn\u2019t clear if he was planning to be there for her personally or Britain. Both, possibly. Theresa tried to look pleased at the prospect. \u201cThere are going to be many great increases in trade, tremendous increases in trade,\u201d he went on, thereby contradicting his former promises to put America first.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a great discussion,\u201d Theresa said neutrally, finally getting a word in edgeways and trying to wrap things up. The press conference ended in chaos with dozens of reporters shouting questions at the same time. A flicker of relief crossed her face. Better to be a Maybot than a pussy-grabbing stable genius any day of the week.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Sky has cast further doubt on the future of Sky News, saying the service is no longer critical to the pay-TV broadcaster. The future of Sky News potentially hangs in the balance after the UK regulator said on Tuesday that Rupert Murdoch\u2019s ownership of the news service could block his \u00a311.7bn bid for Sky because it would give him too much control over UK news media. The deal would see the Murdoch family control the Times, Sunday Times, Sun, Wall Street Journal and Sky News, a situation the Competition &amp; Markets Authority (CMA) said would give them \u201ctoo much influence over public opinion and the political agenda\u201d. Jeremy Darroch, the chief executive of Sky, told analysts on Thursday that the loss-making Sky News was not as important as it was when the company launched in the 1990s and was no longer a \u201ccritical\u201d part of the pay-TV broadcaster\u2019s business. \u201cSky News is a great service. It\u2019s very highly valued,\u201d he told analysts following publication of Sky\u2019s latest financial results. \u201cIt was more important in the overall mix of the company when we were launching, in the early days. It had a lot of brand presence. It was an area we could build in. I wouldn\u2019t describe Sky News as critical to the business today. Indeed I wouldn\u2019t really pick any part of our business as critical.\u201d Sky previously warned the CMA that it could close Sky News if 21st Century Fox were unable to gain regulatory clearance for the \u00a311.7bn bid to buy the 61% of Sky it did not already own. Shutting Sky News would eliminate the media plurality issue at a stroke. Darroch\u2019s failure to give a guarantee on the future of Sky News, which employs about 500 people, follows a similar stance he took with journalists discussing Sky\u2019s first-half results before the call with analysts. Despite the fact that it was Sky that filed the submission to the CMA that threatened the future of Sky News, Darroch refused to comment. Instead he said the regulatory process was being \u201cpredominantly led\u201d by 21st Century Fox. \u201cGenerally the message for all of our business is that we have a day job to do and we have got to keep this business being successful whatever it does,\u201d he said on the conference call. \u201cWe are not being distracted by any of that [regulatory process].\u201d The CMA has launched a consultation looking at three options to solve the public interest issues raised by Sky News: that the deal is blocked, that Sky News is spun off or sold or that Sky News is insulated from the influence of the Murdoch family trust. The latter option would involve creating what the CMA refers to as a \u201cfirewall\u201d such as a truly independent board of directors and guaranteed funding for at least five years. The CMA also raised the possibility that the Murdochs could sell Sky News to Disney separately before its $66bn deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox, which would clear regulatory issues. Earlier this week, the SNP MP Brendan O\u2019Hara accused Sky of using its news staff as \u201cpawns in the takeover\u201d to try to coerce the competition regulator and the culture secretary, Matt Hancock, into clearing the deal. \u201cThe greatest disaster that could befall plurality of media in this country would be if Sky News \u2026 were to be closed by its new owner,\u201d said John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, in the House of Commons on Tuesday. The broadcasting regulator Ofcom has previously said the loss of Sky News could \u201cpresent risks to plurality equal to or greater than those presented by the transaction itself\u201d. The CMA will consult on its provisional findings and potential remedies before delivering its final report to the government by a deadline of 1 May.",

      "bodyText": "Productivity is often viewed as the secret sauce that will deliver improved an standard of living and yet while improved productivity does lead to benefits, what the most recent data on productivity shows is quite often productivity growth comes at the expense of workers. In a general sense \u2013 as Paul Krugman wrote in 1994 \u2013 \u201cproductivity isn\u2019t everything, but in the long run it is almost everything\u201d. The reason being is that if you want to improve the standard of living over time you need to produce more per worker than you did in the past. The only other way to increase national income is to have people pay more for what you produce. During the mining boom this is what happened \u2013 China\u2019s growth meant the demand for iron ore sky-rocketed and Australian mining companies were in the very fortunate position that what they produced was suddenly worth more. But the strive for productivity needs to be seen in the context of how it is produced. Every year the Bureau of Statistics produces its estimates of industry multi-factor productivity which break down the performance of each market-sector industry (public sector productivity is much harder to measure). What the figures highlight is how disconnected productivity growth can be with those industries which are seen to be powering our economy. In 2016-17, the ABS estimates labour productivity grew by 1.1%, while multi-factor productivity grew by 0.7% - the 6th straight year of growth: While labour productivity is essentially unit of output per hour worked, multi-factor productivity attempts to measure the ability of labour to make use of capital to produce that output. The breakdown of productivity into labour, capital and multi-factor highlights the problem of looking at productivity growth and assuming something needs to be done with IR to make things more \u201cflexible\u201d or that somehow we are becoming uncompetitive due to penalty rates or other nonsense that often is spouted. If we look at productivity over the past couple decades it is clear that the flattening of productivity occurred in the mining boom period at a time when capital productivity fell sharply: Essentially what happened is during the mining boom, mining companies invested a massive amount of money in the industry, but that money did not produce an increase in output for some time. It takes a while to build a mine, but the cost of building it actually reduces productivity because you are spending lots of money for little increased output. At the same time there was a large surge in the investment in the electricity sector \u2013 the so-called gold plating of the network also saw productivity in that industry slump: It meant that during the mining boom, the mining industry was actually a drag on our productivity growth \u2013 but huzzah since 2012-13 that hasn\u2019t been an issue \u2013 mining industry multi-factor productivity in that time has grown the third fastest out of all market sector industries. In that same time the amount of labour input has fallen by the most: Such are the vicissitudes of productivity. This year, for example, the biggest productivity growth came in the agricultural industry. Was it due to technical innovation in the past year, or smarter workers, or better IR laws? Nope, it was due to a bumper year for crops. And whereas during a drought, agricultural productivity falls, during a bumper yield year, productivity increases. And despite the big increase in output, the agricultural industry saw the second biggest decline in labour inputs in 2016-17. And yet construction \u2013 the industry which has been the biggest employer in the past year of men, accounting for around 65% of the growth of all male full-time work \u2013 saw the biggest fall in multi-factor productivity in 2016-17. So while construction has been a huge source of employment growth, it has been a drag on productivity growth. As the ABS notes, the industry has seen an increase in labour but a decline in output because the work of the industry has shifted from mining and heavy industrial projects. Thus on the one hand the industry is the saviour \u2013 helping us transition from the mining boom \u2013 and on the other hand it lowers our productivity growth because of that same transition. Little wonder people throw up their hands in despair when economists start to talk \u2013 especially when they talk of units of productivity with little regard for what that growth might entail for workers. The common aspect across all industries over the past two decades is the clear link between a falling growth of labour input and rising multi-factor productivity growth: It is almost as though while productivity is often suggested as producing more from the same amount of workers, in reality it becomes producing more from fewer workers. We see the relationship with the national accounts figures as well, where a lower annual growth in the amount of hours worked is associated with a higher growth of productivity: That doesn\u2019t mean productivity growth is a bad thing \u2013 we should always be seeking to produce more with our labour \u2013 a nation that does not do that will almost certainly see its workers worse off. But while in the long run productivity might be \u201calmost everything\u201d, it does not explain everything in the economy \u2013 and the key remains to ensure that productivity growth brings with it a growth in households standard of living.",
