      "bodyText": "Barclays is preparing to scale back its global ambitions by selling off its once-prized African operations. The bank, under the leadership of its new chief executive, Jes Staley, is reported to have concluded that it is time to leave the continent where it once had major ambitions for growth. In 2005, Barclays spent \u00a32.9bn on a 60% stake in local banking group Absa, 20 years after being forced out by anti-apartheid protesters. By 2012, the bank was boasting that it was making 20% of its profits out of the continent. But Staley is said to have concluded that, against a backdrop of a slowdown in Africa and the devaluation of the rand, it was time to consider a sale of the operations. According to the Financial Times, the board has asked a subcommittee to analyse its options \u2013 avoiding the need for an immediate announcement to the stock market. A sale of the business may not be straightforward but is likely to be discussed alongside Barclays\u2019 2015 results on Tuesday. Barclays is the last of the major high street banks to publish its figures and will be under scrutiny for signs of any deviation by Staley from the strategy set out his predecessor Antony Jenkins. When Jenkins was ousted in July 2015, chairman John McFarlane said it was not because of the strategy he had been pursuing of cutting 19,000 jobs and scaling back the company\u2019s investment bank.",

      "bodyText": "Four of Britain\u2019s biggest banks reported annual results this week and insisted they were robust enough to withstand another global downturn. But what did the results for HSBC, Standard Chartered and the bailed-out duo of Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland tell us about the industry and the wider economy? Bankers\u2019 pay and bonuses Bonuses have not gone away, despite considerable public and political anger over pay since the 2008 crash. When the pay disclosures of the four banks from their annual results are added up, 800 or so of their employees received more than \u20ac1m (\u00a3790,000) in 2015. Barclays will add to that tally when its annual figures are published on Tuesday next week. The four banks who have reported so far have cut their bonus pools for 2015, but that total still stands at \u00a33.7bn. Chief executive pay was down at HSBC and Lloyds but their bosses still earned \u00a37.3m and \u00a38.5m respectively, while pay rose for the chief executives of RBS and Standard Chartered (in part because of a buy-out for its new chief executive) whose packages reached \u00a33.8m and \u00a39m respectively. Behaviour Despite years of damning inquiries and punitive fines, banks are still getting into trouble. Bankers are keen to point out that their problems relate to \u201clegacy issues\u201d \u2013 industry jargon for historical misdemeanours \u2013 but they are struggling to emerge from their shadow. The four banks\u2019 annual reports contained a lengthy list of legal warnings of court cases and potential fines from regulators. Predictably, the payment protect insurance scandal has continued to dominate. The damage faced by the industry now tops \u00a330bn after Lloyds admitted this week that its bill alone had reached \u00a316bn. Lloyds, though, has signalled that the saga could be drawing to a close. Banks are also setting aside money in case they have to pay compensation for controversial packaged bank accounts \u2013 which charge a monthly fee and offer perks such as insurance, but in some cases were missold. Each bank has its own issues, too. RBS flagged a looming penalty from the US authorities over the way it sold bonds before the financial crisis \u2013 and the bill could run into billions of pounds. HSBC is still dealing with the consequences of a \u00a31.2bn fine for money laundering offences in 2012, as it admitted that a monitor installed by the US in the wake of that scandal is concerned it is taking too long to tackle financial crime. Standard Chartered, meanwhile, revealed it was being investigated for potential failings in its defences against financial crime. The UK and global economy The UK economy is crucial for Lloyds and RBS, big lenders to British households and businesses. However, both are being held back from making bigger profits in their domestic businesses because interest rates are at a record low of 0.5%. Lloyds had expected the base rate to rise to 2.5% by 2017, but it revealed this week that it now believed borrowing costs would reach that level two years later \u2013 amid signals from the Bank of England that rate rises are not imminent. Despite that, RBS customers are anticipating a rate rise. Just 15% of its customers are on variable rate mortgages after they moved to fixed rate products in recent years. Both the bailed-out banks could be buffeted by a downturn in the global economy, but HSBC and Standard Chartered have the most exposure to a slump in China and emerging markets. \u201cThe current economic environment is uncertain,\u201d said Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of HSBC. Worryingly for banks with global exposure, interest rates around the world are either low or \u2013 in the case of the eurozone, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland \u2013 turning negative. This makes it difficult for banks to make profits on loans or attract deposits from savers. However, the big question mark is over China, the world\u2019s second largest economy, and whether its recent economic slowdown will become a crash. The prospect of a hard landing has rattled global stock markets and HSBC, which generates a significant amount of its income in Hong Kong, offered some reassurance. It said China was growing more slowly but it would still be the biggest contributor to global economic growth. Brexit Lloyds was determined not to give a view on the EU referendum on 23 June, but RBS, HSBC and Standard Chartered were clearer. HSBC, which earlier this month said it would keep its headquarters in the UK, has warned 1,000 roles could go to Paris if the UK votes to leave. Standard Chartered, London-based but with operations across the globe, said the UK should not break away from Brussels. RBS cited the referendum as a risk to its business and warned of economic uncertainty related to the vote. When will taxpayers get their money back in Lloyds and RBS? Lloyds is in sight of the finish line \u2013 much to George Osborne\u2019s relief. The taxpayer\u2019s stake is now 9%, from the 43% shareholding the government held in 2008. That stake was built when the Treasury pumped in \u00a320bn in wake of Lloyds\u2019 rescue bid for HBOS, the owner of Halifax and Bank of Scotland. But last month the chancellor temporarily abandoned a pledge to make \u00a32bn of shares available to the public at a discount, citing market turmoil. Publication of Lloyds\u2019 results on Thursday, however, put a rocket under the shares. They closed on Friday at 72.1p, just a whisker under the 73.6p at which taxpayers break even on their investment. Any sustained move above that level could allow Osborne to resume selling shares into the market, although any offering to the public seems unlikely until the outcome of the EU referendum is known. The finishing line remains distant for RBS, however. As it reported its eighth consecutive annual loss this week, it also admitted any hope of returning cash to shareholders had been kicked beyond its target of early 2017. Osborne sold off the first chunk of RBS shares in August, reducing the stake from 79% to 73%. The shares closed at 226.6p this week \u2013 below the 502p break-even point.",

Negotiators from the EU and the United States confirmed they were hoping to secure agreement on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership by the end of the year. TTIP, which the EU trade commissioner once described as \u201cthe most contested acronym in Europe\u201d, is a sweeping plan to harmonise regulatory standards, cut tariffs on thousands of items and help companies do more transatlantic business. Talks began in July 2013, but rapidly became bogged down amid widespread public protest, with disputes breaking out over issues ranging from the French film industry to feta cheese. Now the two sides are racing to strike a deal before Barack Obama leaves presidential office in January 2017. On Friday, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Ignacio Garcia Bercero, said it was time to pick up the pace. \u201cWe are ready to seek to conclude negotiations in 2016 provided that the substance is right.\u201d He told journalists that the latest round of negotiations \u2013 the 12th \u2013 were being extended into next week to intensify talks on sensitive areas. His US counterpart, Dan Mullaney, said: \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do but if we can sustain our current intensified engagement we can finish negotiations this year.\u201d The two sides will hold two further rounds of talks in the coming months, with the aim of getting a draft deal by July, leaving the most contentious areas to be resolved in the second half of the year. The drive to strike a deal was underlined by the relaunch of talks this week on one of the most contentious aspects of TTIP, a special court for settling disputes between governments and investors. The European commission wants to establish an exclusive trade court to replace the Investor-State-Dispute Settlement, a system for resolving trade disputes that has existed since the 1960s. This system is written into thousands of investment contracts, including 1,400 involving EU countries, but has aroused growing concern. Critics say ISDS tribunals give private companies too much power to sue governments for lost profits. Tobacco company Philip Morris used ISDS in an attempt to overturn Australia\u2019s plain-packaging laws. Although the challenge failed, the Australian government spent an estimated A$50m (\u00a326m) of taxpayers\u2019 money defending the 2011 law. More recently, TransCanada announced it was suing the US government for $15bn, after the Obama administration rejected on environmental grounds the Keystone XL pipeline, which was designed to pump oil from the tar sands of Canada.

In a career which has spanned Goldman Sachs, UBS and currently Deutsche B\u00f6rse \u2013 which he heads \u2013 he has navigated the peaks of corporate finance but also been witness to some of the most controversial scandals that have dogged banking in the past decade. Now the chief executive in waiting of the proposed merger between the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Deutsche B\u00f6rse, the 48-year-old German\u2019s new position will add to a lengthy CV. Educated at Middlesex University and the London School of Economics, Kengeter joined Goldman Sachs in 1997 and progressed to partner by his mid-30s. When he moved to UBS in 2008, he again rose through the ranks and was identified by the group\u2019s then chief executive Oswald Gr\u00fcbel as a possible successor. After that series of progressions, however, he became tarnished by the UBS rogue trader scandal. Kengeter was in charge of UBS\u2019s investment banking operations when Kweku Adoboil racked up eventual losses of more than \u00a31.5bn. Last year the trial of Tom Hayes, the former UBS trader sentenced to 14 years for fraud for his part in manipulating the Libor rate, heard Kengeter had been at a meeting where plans to manipulate the market were discussed. Hayes told prosecutors that Kengeter was present along with other senior UBS executives at a meeting in Tokyo where Hayes discussed how he was going to influence submitters setting the rate. Kengeter left UBS in 2013 and was appointed chief executive of Deutsche B\u00f6rse in 2014, a position he took up last June and to which he commutes from the west London home he shares with his wife and three children. While at UBS, he said he liked to be at his desk by 7am but tried to fit in sports activitiesat weekends. In his case, this means running marathons and taking part in skiing competitions across mountains. He has been reported to have registered for the Patrouille des Glaciers, a race organised by the Swiss army from Verbier to Zermatt. These extreme sports are apparently balanced out by his passion for yoga and neigong, a Chinese breathing and meditation discipline he became familiar with while working in Hong Kong.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco is considering cutting store staff by 39,000 over the next three years as Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket group attempts to reverse a slump in profits. The potential job losses, revealed in a leaked document, are the equivalent of Tesco shedding one in six employees, either by cutting jobs or reducing hours. Tesco confirmed the validity of the document but said it had modelled various scenarios and had no plans to announce further job losses. The group, which employs more than 300,000 people in the UK, cut thousands of jobs last year as its new boss, Dave Lewis, tried to turn around the company\u2019s financial performance. The retailer reported a \u00a36.4bn pre-tax loss last year, one of the biggest in British corporate history. Tesco\u2019s large out-of-town supermarkets have suffered as British households have changed shopping habits, moving away from buying food in one weekly shop and turning increasingly to convenience stores, online and the discounters Aldi and Lidl. Tesco is also being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office after a \u00a3326m black hole was discovered in its accounts. The proposals are part of a programme called \u201cProject Pace\u201d, according to the document. An extract was posted on the website verylittlehelps.com, a forum used by Tesco staff. It says Tesco has modelled the impact of a \u00a3500m reduction in the amount it pays in-store staff. This cut would be after recognising the additional cost of introducing the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, which means staff over the age of 25 must be paid at least \u00a37.20 an hour from April. The \u00a3500m reduction would lead to roughly 39,000 fewer workers in shops within three years. The document says this is the equivalent of one in six employees either leaving or having their hours cut. This includes large stores in the north of England and Scotland taking a bigger hit than other parts of the country, with contracted staff hours falling by 18%. Tesco said: \u201cThis is not a new programme of job losses, and we are not announcing one. We do not comment on rumours other than to say that we are transforming Tesco into an organisation that meets the needs of customers in a rapidly changing retail sector, and as such continue to plan accordingly.\u201d Roughly 45,000 people leave Tesco every year through natural wastage, meaning the cuts could be achieved without redundancies if the company chooses to not replace departing employees. Britain\u2019s big four supermarkets have already cut thousands of jobs in the last year as they adapt to falling sales in their supermarkets. Last year Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons closed dozens of shops. They have also scrapped new developments, cut head office jobs, removed layers of management within supermarkets and shortened office hours. In contrast, Aldi and Lidl, the German discounters, are hiring thousands of workers. Earlier this month Aldi announced it would create 5,000 jobs in the UK this year for the opening of 80 new shops. The latest market share figures from Kantar show Tesco accounts for 28.5% of grocery spending in the UK, down from 29% a year ago. However, Aldi and Lidl\u2019s market share grew from a combined 8.4% in 2015 to 9.8%.",

Tesco\u2019s large out-of-town supermarkets have suffered as British households have changed shopping habits, moving away from buying food in one weekly shop and turning increasingly to convenience stores, online and the discounters Aldi and Lidl.</p> <p>Tesco is also being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/25/tesco-could-face-500m-fine-accounting-scandal-analysts-say\">investigated by the Serious Fraud Office </a>after a \u00a3326m black hole was discovered in its accounts.</p> <p>The proposals are part of a programme called \u201cProject Pace\u201d, according to the document. An extract was posted on the website verylittlehelps.com, a forum used by Tesco staff.</p> <p>It says Tesco has modelled the impact of a \u00a3500m reduction in the amount it pays in-store staff. This cut would be after recognising the additional cost of introducing the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, which means staff over the age of 25 must be paid at least \u00a37.20 an hour from April.</p> <p>The \u00a3500m reduction would lead to roughly 39,000 fewer workers in shops within three years. The document says this is the equivalent of one in six employees either leaving or having their hours cut. This includes large stores in the north of England and Scotland taking a bigger hit than other parts of the country, with contracted staff hours falling by 18%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/22/top-supermarkets-refuse-sign-anti-brexit-letter-eu-referendum-sainsburys-morrisons-tesco\">Top supermarkets refuse to sign UK firms' anti-Brexit letter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tesco said: \u201cThis is not a new programme of job losses, and we are not announcing one.

Last year Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons closed dozens of shops. They have also scrapped new developments, cut head office jobs, removed layers of management within supermarkets and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/29/tesco-to-close-almost-a-quarter-of-24-hour-stores\">shortened office hours.</a></p> <p>In contrast, Aldi and Lidl, the German discounters, are hiring thousands of workers.</p> <p>Earlier this month Aldi announced it would create 5,000 jobs in the UK this year for the opening of 80 new shops.</p> <p>The latest market share figures from Kantar show Tesco accounts for 28.5% of grocery spending in the UK, down from 29% a year ago.</p> <p>However, Aldi and Lidl\u2019s market share grew from a combined 8.4% in 2015 to 9.8%.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The smartphone revolution has transformed Arm Holdings into the UK\u2019s leading technology company, but while the pace of change is now showing signs of slowing, Arm is not. Instead, the Cambridge-based company appears to be at the heart of a new front in technological innovation. Founded in a Cambridge barn 25 years ago, Arm is now worth almost \u00a314bn. With its hi-tech focus and non-London base, it is the sort of company the government wants at the forefront of the country\u2019s economy. Arm designs the key technology that goes into making chips and then licenses it to semiconductor manufacturers. It has become a key supplier to Apple and its technology is effectively the brains behind the iPhone. However, only 45% of the 15bn chips that featured its technology last year were for mobile devices. Arm has now developed its technology so far that it could have major implications for day-to-day life. It has cut the size and cost and improved the energy efficiency of chips so much that, in theory, they can be embedded into many everyday objects and devices. The company is at the forefront of what has become known as the \u201cinternet of things\u201d. \u201cSome of our licensees sell chips for 20 cents that have got more compute power in them than put a man on the moon,\u201d said Simon Segars, the chief executive of Arm. \u201cSo if you put that everywhere, imagine what you can then do with the data.\u201d Segars was the 16th employee to join Arm and led the development of the Arm7 and Arm9, the processors in the first digital mobile phones. He became chief executive in 2013, replacing Warren East, now the boss of Rolls-Royce. Arm has already diversified into washing machines and digital televisions, meaning the proportion of the company\u2019s technology in mobiles has rapidly decreased from a decade ago. However, the opportunities outside mobile are growing as devices across households and towns become connected to the internet. Segars, who lives with his family in Silicon Valley, said: \u201cYou really won\u2019t see a big \u2018aha\u2019 moment where you go \u2018Aha the internet of things is here\u2019. It is going to be quite gradual, but, as an overall technology trend, it can impact everything. \u201cA lot of it is in invisible infrastructure that just makes a city like London work more effectively. The fact that the street lights turn on when it gets dark instead of at 4.30 is because a computer somewhere worked out it is dark so turns the lights on. Most of embedded computing is going to be in things you never see.\u201d Arm believes more computers will be embedded into cars, creating a major new market for the company. Segars says automotive investment by technology companies, traditional carmakers and venture capitalists in the area has \u201cexploded\u201d. \u201cAutomotive is another example where because of what you can economically build in silicon there is an opportunity to make cars smarter, safer, use less fuel and just better. That comes about through having computers embedded in cars,\u201d Segars said. \u201cIf you extrapolate that further, you can get the car doing things for itself. The ultimate goal of self-driving cars I think is a few years away. A self-driving car is going to need a lot of computer power in it, a car becomes a super computer on wheels.\u201d Arm is already working on automotive projects with a range of companies, but Segars refused to comment on rumours that Apple is planning a driverless car. Despite Apple reporting a slowdown in sales of the iPhone, Segars said that Arm should continue to enjoy increasing revenues in mobile as smartphones get even more powerful and sales of entry-level and mid-range devices grow. The increasing number of smartphones in emerging economies means Arm technology could be used to tackle a range of health and social problems. The company is working with Unicef, which has set up innovation labs that are working on using photos taken by smartphones to diagnose health problems. \u201cIf you are a subsistence farmer in Africa and you upgrade from a basic handset that does voice and text to something that allows you to connect to the internet and gives you access to the world\u2019s data, that is quite a life-changing moment and the positive side effects of all of that I think is going to be incredible,\u201d Segars said. As the spread of Arm\u2019s technology and smartphones broadens, so does concern about security. The topic is high on the industry\u2019s agenda after Apple criticised the FBI\u2019s request to build a back door into the encrypted data in an iPhone. Arm would have to develop the backdoor into its technology if the FBI gets it way, but it is clear Segars shares the views of Apple boss Tim Cook. \u201cWe believe users should own their data and control who has access to it,\u201d he said. \u201cSecurity systems should be as robust as possible to ensure that. New connected technologies will only achieve scale if they are trusted so maintaining a foundation of security is of paramount importance.\u201d Segars declined to comment on the Apple and FBI row. On the possible Brexit, he said he was not one of the 200 company bosses who signed a letter stating that Britain should remain in the European Union. However, Segars says the company supports Britain remaining in the EU. \u201cWe are pro low barriers to trade, and the EU enables that, and we are definitely a beneficiary of being able to hire easily from a larger pool of people. That helps our business. So from that angle, we would like those conditions to remain.\u201d The company employs 1,600 people in Cambridge-, just under half its total workforce, and this includes employees from 23 EU countries other than the UK. Segers said that Brexit might have little impact on Arm, which will give hope to campaigners pushing for the country to leave the EU. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine it is going to make that much difference really. We are a UK listed company, our headquarters is here \u2013 that ain\u2019t going to change.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct, the sportswear retailer, is facing higher borrowing costs after deciding to back away from a controversial loan facility provided at favourable rates by its billionaire founder Mike Ashley. The company said the move was to avoid further criticism over related-party transactions \u2013 essentially deals with Ashley, who owns 55% of the company. The stock market value of the retailer \u2013 whose shares have almost halved since December after poor trading announcements and Guardian revelations about pay and working conditions \u2013 dropped by a further 3% on Friday morning but later clawed back some ground to end 0.5% down at 397p. Since May 2014, Sports Direct has used a revolving credit facility with several banks and the overdraft was recently increased to an upper limit of \u00a3788m. The interest rate on the debt rises when more than a third of the facility is used, meaning higher charges when Sports Direct borrows more than \u00a3263m. To avoid the higher interest charges, Sports Direct instead used a \u00a3250m loan facility provided personally by Ashley, as the \u201crate of interest payable on this facility is circa 50% lower than that payable on the [bank facility], and does not attract arrangement fees or commitment fees\u201d. While the arrangement has saved the company about \u00a31m, shareholders have always disliked the deal as it appears to allow Ashley to tighten his hold on the company. Sports Direct said: \u201cIn the coming months Sports Direct expects its borrowing requirements will be consistently in excess of \u00a3263m. It has been decided that it is in the best interests of the group and its shareholders to avoid further criticism at this time. \u201cAccordingly the group will not draw down from the [Ashley loan facility] in the foreseeable future, which will lead to an increase in the overall cost of borrowing.\u201d At the current share price, Sports Direct looks unlikely to retain its status as a FTSE 100 company when the index is reshuffled next week. In December, before the Guardian revealed that temporary workers at Sports Direct were receiving in effect hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage, the shares were worth about 675p each. Since then the group has been branded a \u201cscar on British business\u201d by the Institute of Directors, been the subject of a parliamentary debate after the former shadow business minister Chuka Umunna tabled an urgent question, and been rounded on by its own investors, including City hedge fund boss Crispin Odey, who described Ashley\u2019s authority over other Sports Direct directors as \u201cdangerous\u201d. The company subsequently responded by announcing a pay rise for its staff, which was dismissed as a \u201cPR stunt\u201d, as well as a review of all agency staff terms and conditions, which it said would be overseen personally by Ashley.",

The interest rate on the debt rises when more than a third of the facility is used, meaning higher charges when Sports Direct borrows more than \u00a3263m.</p> <p>To avoid the higher interest charges, Sports Direct instead used a \u00a3250m loan facility provided personally by Ashley, as the \u201crate of interest payable on this facility is circa 50% lower than that payable on the [bank facility], and does not attract arrangement fees or commitment fees\u201d. </p> <p>While the arrangement has saved the company about \u00a31m, shareholders have always disliked the deal as it appears to allow Ashley to tighten his hold on the company.</p> <p>Sports Direct said: \u201cIn the coming months Sports Direct expects its borrowing requirements will be consistently in excess of \u00a3263m. It has been decided that it is in the best interests of the group and its shareholders to avoid further criticism at this time.</p> <p>\u201cAccordingly the group will not draw down from the [Ashley loan facility] in the foreseeable future, which will lead to an increase in the overall cost of borrowing.\u201d</p> <p>At the current share price, Sports Direct looks unlikely to retain its status as a FTSE 100 company when the index is reshuffled next week.</p> <p>In December, before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\">the Guardian revealed that temporary workers at Sports Direct were receiving in effect hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage</a>, the shares were worth about 675p each.</p> <p>Since then the group has been branded a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/sports-direct-share-price-falls-following-guardian-working-practices-revelations\">\u201cscar on British business\u201d by the Institute of Directors</a>, been the subject of a parliamentary debate after the former shadow business minister <a href=\"http://www.chuka.org.uk/\">Chuka Umunna</a> tabled an urgent question, and been rounded on by its own investors, including City hedge fund boss Crispin Odey, who described Ashley\u2019s authority over other Sports Direct directors as \u201cdangerous\u201d.</p> <p>The company subsequently responded by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/31/sports-direct-pledges-10m-towards-staff-pay-rise\">announcing a pay rise for its staff</a>, which was dismissed as a \u201cPR stunt\u201d, as well as a review of all agency staff terms and conditions, which it said would be overseen personally by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/mike-ashley\">Ashley</a>.</p>",

The contracts to be sold include the management of Medway secure training centre (STC) in Kent, where five men were arrested in January after an undercover BBC Panorama investigation exposed the alleged abuse of \u201ctrainees\u201d. G4S has been repeatedly criticised over the use of restraint at Medway STC, which the company has run since it opened in 1998. The second child prison run by the company, at Oakhill, Milton Keynes, is also to be sold. A third secure training centre, Rainsbrook, is already in the process of being transferred to a new company, MTC Novo. A G4S statement said the sale of the operation was going ahead as part of \u201cits ongoing review of its portfolio of businesses\u201d. The business, with revenues of \u00a340m a year, includes the management of 13 children\u2019s homes. \u201cThe wellbeing and education of the children in the company\u2019s care will remain its priority until such time as an orderly transition to a new operator has been completed,\u201d it said. The STCs hold 12- to 17-year-olds who have been sentenced to, or remanded in custody. The announcement also follows an investigation by the Ministry of Justice into the accuracy of figures indicating that no children were injured while being restrained by staff at Medway in 2014. The MoJ confirmed that it had launched an audit of all the restraint injury data from Medway STC that had been provided to the Youth Justice Board by G4S. The decision to sell the contracts to run the two youth prisons and 13 local authority children\u2019s homes does not concern the prisons or immigration detention centres also managed by the company. Penal reformers called for the STCs to be shut down instead of sold. \u201cThese child jails have been the focus of much controversy, not least the recent BBC Panorama documentary into abuse by staff at Medway,\u201d said Andrew Neilson, of the Howard League for Penal Reform. \u201cThere is now an opportunity developing to close the secure training centres down completely.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Serious allegations of abuse and bullying at a G4S-run youth prison were made more than a decade before the current controversy surrounding the secure training centre which is now to be sold off, the Guardian can reveal. Eleven staff were suspended or sacked from Medway STC in Kent last month after a BBC documentary alleged staff were inappropriately restraining inmates and falsifying statistics to improve the jail\u2019s record. G4S announced on Friday that it was to sell its \u201cchildren\u2019s services businesses\u201d, including the contracts for Medway and another STC, in Oakhill, Milton Keynes. The announcement came on the same day the Guardian was able to report that two Medway whistleblowers had made claims in 2003 about inmates being abused by staff, and staff being bullied by the head of G4S children\u2019s services, Paul Cook, who was in charge of the facility. No significant action appears to have been taken as a result of the complaint. The Guardian understands Kent police spoke to one of the whistleblowers in 2003 but took no statement or action. A letter, sent to the Youth Justice Board (YJB), G4S, Social Services Inspectorate and a Home Office minister by a youth justice academic on behalf of the whistleblowers, alleges children had been badly hurt when guards tried to restrain them, including one boy having his shoulder dislocated, and that staff were encouraged to falsify restraint statistics. The Guardian has also spoken to former Medway inmates who have made fresh allegations of abuse, including one woman who, as a teenager, suffered a miscarriage in the youth jail and was locked in her cell alone to endure the ordeal. The Panorama investigation showed staff talking openly about falsifying records of violent incidents in order to prevent the company being fined for \u201closing control\u201d of those in their care. Under STC rules, if more than two young people are involved in a fight, it is classified as the guards losing control of the centre. Allegations of abuse, now being investigated by police, included children being slapped on the head and the use of restraint tactics against STC rules, including pressing on a boy\u2019s windpipe causing him to complain that he could not breathe. G4S was quick to condemn those members of staff who had been secretly filmed abusing children or talking out of turn, describing them as bad apples that had to be got rid of. Cook said he was \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d by the revelations. But identical allegations were made 12 years earlier when Prof John Pitts, an expert in youth crime and youth justice who was contacted by the Medway whistleblowers, wrote to the relevant authorities on their behalf in 2003. That year Cook was appointed head of G4S children\u2019s services and was acting director of Medway. The letter contains a litany of alleged abuses, including claims that \u201ca boy had his shoulder dislocated whilst being restrained\u201d, another boy \u201csustained carpet burns to his face\u201d as he was restrained, and a duty manager grabbed a boy by the neck and told him \u201cyou will fucking respect me\u201d. It also alleges that staff claimed Cook was a bully. \u201cHe has stated that he has the power to \u2018change the course of people\u2019s career\u2019 and \u2018sack people on the spot\u2019,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cStaff are encouraged to falsify statistics. Mr Cook has told staff not to take their concerns to the Home Office monitor and that they should instead go to him. This is not in line with the company\u2019s policy and procedure.\u201d Pitts explains in the letter that he has spoken at length with the whistleblowers and believes they are telling the truth. He wrote: \u201cI am sure that you will be as concerned as I am by the information below, not least because it has worrying echoes of the \u2018Pindown\u2019 scandal of 1991. I would appreciate it if, having read what follows, you could let me know what action you plan to take.\u201d Speaking to the Guardian this week, Pitts said he may have received one brief reply from one of the agencies he contacted acknowledging receipt of his letter but did not receive a substantive response. \u201cIt got lost in the machinery,\u201d he said. His letter was written seven months before the teenager Gareth Myatt died after being restrained at Rainsbrook, which was also run by G4S. A document seen by the Guardian, entitled Physical Control In Care (PCC) Introduction, is a G4S staff training manual explaining when and how restraint should be used in STCs. It was seized by police after Myatt\u2019s death and lists the names of 11 PCC instructors, with their nicknames in brackets, including Rowdy, Clubber, Mauler and Breaker. Malcolm Stevens, who in 2003 was the director of Rebound, the then title of G4S\u2019s children\u2019s services, said Pitts\u2019 letter triggered a two-phase inspection by the Social Services Inspectorate. But the inspection report suggests that the first phase took place before Pitts wrote the letter. It does not make any reference to Pitts or the whistleblowers and only alludes to non-specific complaints that had been made. The Home Office was unable to locate the letter from Pitts or its responses . The YJB confirmed it received the letter and referred it to Medway social services. The YJB said Pitts was made aware of this at the time but he has no recollection of receiving a response. Medway social services did not respond when asked to comment. The Ministry of Justice said: \u201cThe safety and welfare of young people in custody is vital. As with the footage gathered by Panorama, these allegations are extremely concerning and we will examine them very carefully. \u201cThe justice secretary has been clear that the provision for young people in our care is not good enough which is why he has asked Charlie Taylor to review the entire youth justice system.\u201d Lin Hinnigan, the YJB chief executive, said: \u201cThe safety of children in custody is critical. We have bolstered our monitoring at Medway STC and, alongside other agencies involved in providing care there, are reviewing our systems to understand why we were all unaware of the shocking behaviours which Panorama identified. \u201cAs soon as these two additional historical allegations were brought to our attention by the Guardian, we contacted the relevant authorities.\u201d Deborah Coles, of the campaigning organisation Inquest, said: \u201cThat this alleged mistreatment was not picked up and acted upon by monitoring and oversight systems that should be in place to protect and safeguard vulnerable children from abuse is an indictment of the Youth Justice Board and the Home Office. \u201cIf this letter had been acted upon Gareth Myatt may well still be alive.\u201d In response to the allegations made in Pitts\u2019 letter, Cook told the Guardian: \u201cIn 2003 \u2026 I was asked to go to the centre to address serious failings and challenge the ways of working which had resulted in a chaotic regime for young people. At times, this was unpopular among some of the staff but when inspectors returned later in 2003, staff reported a clearer sense of direction for themselves and the whole centre. \u201cI have always welcomed independent scrutiny and encouraged my team to work constructively with inspectors and other external agencies in an open but professional way and respond positively to the recommendations made in order to keep young people, and improving their life chances, at the heart of what we do.\u201d Medway has historically had difficulties retaining staff. A written answer to a parliamentary question from the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Marks last month revealed there had been a 60% turnover of staff at the facility in 2015. G4S told the Guardian that Pitts\u2019 letter had been copied to a \u201cnumber of the most senior figures in the country with responsibility for child protection\u201d and that \u201cit is somewhat inconceivable that these issues were not examined in the normal course by both the inspectorate and Medway children\u2019s services\u201d. The regional president for G4S in the UK and Ireland, Peter Neden, said: \u201cOur secure training centres are open to a range of independent professionals, from care workers, to Barnardo\u2019s, the NHS and Youth Justice Board, who observe the young people on site and the behaviour of our staff on a daily basis. Under G4S management these centres have received positive recognition from inspecting bodies, with over a dozen inspections rating them as \u2018outstanding\u2019. \u201cWe continue to support the work of the newly appointed Ministry of Justice improvement board to address the very serious issues raised at the Medway secure training centre last month.\u201d Eric Allison is the Guardian\u2019s prison correspondent and was a consultant on Panorama\u2019s Teenage Prison Abuse Exposed",

      "body": "<p>Serious allegations of abuse and bullying at a G4S-run youth prison were made more than a decade before the current controversy surrounding the secure training centre which is now to be sold off, the Guardian can reveal.<br></p> <p>Eleven staff were suspended or sacked from Medway STC in Kent last month after a BBC documentary alleged staff were inappropriately restraining inmates and falsifying statistics to improve the jail\u2019s record. G4S announced on Friday that it was to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/26/g4s-to-sell-controversial-youth-jail-contracts\">sell its \u201cchildren\u2019s services businesses\u201d</a>, including the contracts for Medway and another STC, in Oakhill, Milton Keynes.</p> <p>The announcement came on the same day the Guardian was able to report that two Medway whistleblowers had made claims in 2003 about inmates being abused by staff, and staff being bullied by the head of G4S children\u2019s services, Paul Cook, who was in charge of the facility. No significant action appears to have been taken as a result of the complaint.</p> <p>The Guardian understands Kent police spoke to one of the whistleblowers in 2003 but took no statement or action.</p> <p>A letter, sent to the Youth Justice Board (YJB), G4S, Social Services Inspectorate and a Home Office minister by a youth justice academic on behalf of the whistleblowers, alleges children had been badly hurt when guards tried to restrain them, including one boy having his shoulder dislocated, and that staff were encouraged to falsify restraint statistics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/26/former-medway-inmate-the-guard-slammed-my-face-off-the-ice\">Former Medway inmate: 'The guard slammed my face off the ice'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Guardian has also spoken to former Medway inmates who have made fresh allegations of abuse, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/26/former-medway-inmate-the-guard-slammed-my-face-off-the-ice\">one woman who, as a teenager, suffered a miscarriage in the youth jail</a> and was locked in her cell alone to endure the ordeal.</p> <p>The Panorama investigation showed staff talking openly about falsifying records of violent incidents in order to prevent the company being fined for \u201closing control\u201d of those in their care. Under STC rules, if more than two young people are involved in a fight, it is classified as the guards losing control of the centre.</p> <p>Allegations of abuse, now being investigated by police, included children being slapped on the head and the use of restraint tactics against STC rules, including pressing on a boy\u2019s windpipe causing him to complain that he could not breathe.</p> <p>G4S was quick to condemn those members of staff who had been secretly filmed abusing children or talking out of turn, describing them as bad apples that had to be got rid of. Cook said he was \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d by the revelations.</p> <p>But identical allegations were made 12 years earlier when Prof John Pitts, an expert in youth crime and youth justice who was contacted by the Medway whistleblowers, wrote to the relevant authorities on their behalf in 2003. That year Cook was appointed head of G4S children\u2019s services and was acting director of Medway.</p> <p>The letter contains a litany of alleged abuses, including claims that \u201ca boy had his shoulder dislocated whilst being restrained\u201d, another boy \u201csustained carpet burns to his face\u201d as he was restrained, and a duty manager grabbed a boy by the neck and told him \u201cyou will fucking respect me\u201d.</p> <p>It also alleges that staff claimed Cook was a bully. \u201cHe has stated that he has the power to \u2018change the course of people\u2019s career\u2019 and \u2018sack people on the spot\u2019,\u201d the letter reads.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"07a641982e5cad3c503397372d029c015ab0fd0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07a641982e5cad3c503397372d029c015ab0fd0d/27_16_1103_662/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Head of G4S children's services Paul Cook\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Cook.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cStaff are encouraged to falsify statistics.

I would appreciate it if, having read what follows, you could let me know what action you plan to take.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian this week, Pitts said he may have received one brief reply from one of the agencies he contacted acknowledging receipt of his letter but did not receive a substantive response.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt got lost in the machinery,\u201d he said. </p> <p>His letter was written seven months before the teenager Gareth Myatt died after being restrained at Rainsbrook, which was also run by G4S.</p> <p>A document seen by the Guardian, entitled Physical Control In Care (PCC) Introduction, is a G4S staff training manual explaining when and how restraint should be used in STCs.

    "webTitle": "G20: Market rally continues, as US GDP growth better than expected - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Another indicator that a US rate rise could come sooner than expected comes with a bigger than expected rise in consumer spending. The Commerce Department said consumer spending climbed by 0.5% in February, compared to expectations of a 0.3% increase. Meanwhile there was also a 0.5% rise in income, the largest increase since June. And the final release of the University of Michigan consumer confidence survey rose to 91.7, up from 90.7. But Rob Carnell at ING Bank said it was still difficult to judge the current state of the US economy: As we head into payrolls week next week, there is still a distinct lack of clarity about where the US economy is headed. And given the nature of the non-farm payrolls jobs release, we may not be much the wiser by next Friday, and in consequence, there is likely to still be considerable uncertainty about the direction the Fed will be taking. Markets dislike uncertainty. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again on Monday. After a brief revival, the pound is slipping back to seven year lows against the dollar, on a combination of the better than expected US GDP figures and continuing uncertainty over the UK referendum on whether to leave the European Union. Sterling is now down at $1.3925, heading back towards the seven year low of $1.3878 it reached on Wednesday. US markets have followed their European counterparts higher, boosted by rising oil prices and better than expected American GDP figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed around 90 points or 0.5% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.3% and Nasdaq 0.7% higher at the open. Hopes of co-ordinated global policy measures from the G20 finance ministers meeting in Shanghai seem to be fading. Reuters reports: China sought to restore confidence in its economy as financial leaders from G20 nations gathered in Shanghai on Friday, and Premier Li Keqiang urged greater global coordination and consideration of policy spillovers. But Germany appeared to all but rule out coordinated stimulus to counter a deepening global chill, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said there was no need for a crisis response, as in 2009 when the Group of 20 (G20) major economies agreed on coordinated stimulus to prevent a worldwide depression. While the health of the world\u2019s second-largest economy, which hosts the G20 presidency this year, is a key talking point around the two-day summit, the threat of the UK leaving the European Union and its political and economic implications have also surfaced as concerns among participants in the meeting. \u201cMacroeconomic policy coordination needs to be strengthened. The global economic and financial situation may have become more grim and complex. It is time for countries to stand together to tide over difficulties,\u201d Li said in a video message at the opening of the meeting. Several other policymakers have urged better coordination, but there was disagreement about what steps to take, making it unlikely that concrete action points will emerge from the meeting. \u201cTalking about further stimulus just distracts from the real tasks at hand,\u201d Germany\u2019s Minister of Finance Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said, rebuffing a recommendation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the G20 should start planning now for a coordinated stimulus programme. \u201cWe, therefore, do not agree on a G20 fiscal stimulus package as some argue, in case outlook risks materialise.\u201d Lew had a similar message, saying there was a great deal of economic uncertainty at present but no crisis. \u201cIt would not be reasonable to expect a crisis response in an environment that is not a crisis,\u201d he said told reporters. Overhanging the summit of major economy finance ministers and central bankers are global concerns about China\u2019s ability to manage its domestic markets, currency and commitment to wider restructuring reforms. Concerns about its slowing economy and confusion over its currency policy were among the factors which sowed turmoil in global markets in January. The case for further policy stimulus amid rising debt levels and already extremely low interest rates was a hard sell among some other G20 members. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned cutting rates below zero carried serious risks, and blamed the recent global slump in shares and other assets on the failure of governments to make bold economics reforms. Schaeuble said the debt-financed growth model had \u201creached its limits (and) is even causing new problems, raising debt, causing bubbles and excessive risk taking, zombifying the economy.\u201d And Japan\u2019s Finance Minister Taro Aso shrugged off calls from some quarters for Tokyo to roll out fresh fiscal stimulus. Japan\u2019s central bank stunned investors by adopting negative interest rates last month. The dollar has strengthened following the US GDP data, with sterling now at $1.3960 having earlier regained the $1.4 level. Dennis de Jong, managing directorat UFX.com, said: A dreary Dow Jones is likely to be perked up by today\u2019s better than expected US GDP figures, with annualised growth jumping up to the 1% mark. Financial markets were expecting a slowdown in the world\u2019s largest economy, so much so that conversations about a recession weren\u2019t far away. Yet, with unemployment remaining low and wages increasing at their fastest rate since 2009, growth is back on the agenda. Add to that cheap fuel prices and low mortgage rates, and it may only be a matter of time until disposable incomes are fully realised and growth continues to speed up. The better than expected US GDP figures should at least calm fears the country is heading into a recession. The US economy saw a slowdown in growth in the fourth quarter, but not as much as first thought. In its second revision, the Commerce Department said GDP grew at an annual rate of 1%, compared to the initial forecast of 0.7%. Analysts had been expecting the figure to be revised down to 0.4%. But this is still a slowdown on the 2% growth reported in the previous three months. The revision came as businesses seemed less aggressive in their efforts to reduce inventory. More signs of weak inflation across the eurozone. German\u2019s harmonised consumer price index is up 0.4% month on month, but down 0.2% year on year, compared to expectations of a flat figure. This is the lowest annual level since January 2015. Downbeat data from Greece: More for the ECB to think about, with German inflation set to go into negative territory. Reuters reports: German inflation turned negative in February for the first time in five months, preliminary state data indicated on Friday, giving proponents of further monetary policy easing more ammunition for a European Central Bank meeting next month. Consumer prices fell below zero on the year in five German states, the data showed. In the most populous state North Rhine-Westphalia, annual inflation slowed to 0.1 percent from 0.6 percent in January. The state readings will feed into nationwide inflation data due at 1300 GMT (08:00 a.m. EST). Capital Economics analyst Jessica Hinds said the state data suggested that pan-German EU-harmonized consumer price inflation (HICP) dropped to -0.1 percent from +0.4 percent in January. The market rally is continuing, helped by renewed strength in the oil prices. Brent crude is up 2% at $36.03 a barrel on hopes that a meeting between Saudia Arabia, Russia and Venezuela could tackle the low oil price. Analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: The global indices continued to strive for recent highs this Friday, their growth sustained by a $36 per barrel crossing surge from Brent Crude. However, if expectations of a miserly US fourth quarter GDP figure this afternoon are accurate the US open may end up slightly spoiling the end of week party. Currently, at least, the Dow Jones is joining in with its galloping European peers, the futures promising a 110 point rise when the bell rings on Wall Street, something that would leave the index at its highest point since the first week of January. Yet the spectre of this afternoon\u2019s latest fourth quarter GDP reading may temper investors\u2019 enthusiasm, analysts forecasting a downward revision from an already awful annualised 0.7% to 0.4%. And here\u2019s more for the ECB to think about: European confidence and inflation figures make a strong case for further stimulus measures from the European Central Bank at its March meeting, says Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight: Certainly, the marked drop in overall business and consumer confidence across the Eurozone to an 8-month low heightens concern about faltering growth. However, price developments in the survey did offer a little bit of good news for the ECB. The bank will be slightly relieved to see that consumers\u2019 inflation expectations picked up to a 7-month high in February, although they were still well below long-term norms. Furthermore, pricing expectations rose slightly for retailers and were stable among retailers. However, they weakened among manufacturers In addition to the marked drop in Eurozone consumer and business confidence in February, pressure for appreciable ECB stimulus in March has been ramped up by early Eurozone consumer price data for February which suggests that a return to deflation is very possible as a consequence of lower oil, commodity and food prices. Specifically, Spanish deflation widened sharply to 0.9% in February (the sharpest since last October) from 0.4% in January while France saw consumer prices fall 0.1% year-on-year after an increase of 0.1% in January. There is clearly now a very real risk that the Eurozone returned to deflation in February despite consumer price inflation rising to an eight-month high of 0.3% in January. While this would be primarily due to lower oil and commodity prices, it would likely reinforce ECB concerns about potential second round effects on wages and price setting. We expect the ECB to trim its deposit rate by a further 10 basis points to -0.40% at its March meeting and believe it could very well step up its monthly purchase of assets (perhaps by \u20ac20bn-\u20ac30bn from the current level of \u20ac60bn. There are reports that the ECB is considering introducing a double tier on its deposit rate in order to ease the pressure on banks\u2019 profitability from another cut. The higher negative rate would only be charged on banks\u2019 deposits with the ECB above a certain level Will the weak confidence data mean consumers and businesses keep their hands in their pockets? Bert Colijn at ING Bank says: Economic sentiment... was worse than analysts expected and reflects the somber mood about the Eurozone economy in the beginning of the year, although the indicator is still above its long-term average. The weak external environment is clearly impacting the business sector, as both manufacturing and services indicated weakening sentiment. Consumers even experienced the largest one-month drop in confidence since 2012. Both businesses and consumers are clearly spooked by concerns about the strength of the global economy and financial markets, geopolitical risks and a looming Brexit. For manufacturing, the global weakness is impacting current business, as orders, production and exports went down. The service sector indicated in this survey that recent demand was actually better than in January, but that expectations about future demand went down. Without any hard data for the first quarter, it is difficult to say how the downbeat survey results translate to output growth. Will consumers and businesses act on their negative sentiment or in other words: are they walking the walk or just talking the talk? Last summer, consumer confidence declined on the latest leg of the Greek crisis and the Chinese stock market crash, but consumption growth accelerated in the third quarter. With unemployment coming down, oil prices low and a weak euro, quite a few conditions for growth are benign, but large downside risks remain apparent. In a sense, the Eurozone currently resembles a 50-year old overweight smoker: there are a lot of downside risks, but the base case for the short-term remains fairly decent. Eurozone economic sentiment slipped in February, according to new figures from the European Commission. The sentiment index fell from 105.1 in January to 103.8, below an expected 104.3. Consumer confidence was -8.8, down on January\u2019s -6.3 but in line with forecasts. In the run-up to the UK referendum on Europe, we should expect some dramatic moves in sterling, says Caxton FX analyst Nicholas Laser-Ebisch: As June 23rd approaches, it is likely that the strength of the pound will correlate highly with opinion polls discussing Britain\u2019s EU membership. However, the uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum and possible Brexit - the UK\u2019s most historically unprecedented event of the last few decades - means that the coming months could see quite random currency movements. A main factor of this will be the variety of opinions (both in the UK and outside) centring around the merits of staying in the EU, versus leaving. As beliefs clash, and political rhetoric ramps up, we will likely see exchange rate swings of up to 5% in the next 4 months leading up to the referendum (we have already seen 6% and 8% movements with the pound/dollar and the pound/euro respectively this year). More from George Osborne\u2019s interview with the BBC. The UK chancellor has said the risks to the global economy are at their worst since the financial crisis, making it the worst possible time to be contemplating leaving Europe. Osborne tweeted: The concerns about the global economy echo a speech Osborne made in January, when he warned of \u201ca dangerous cocktail of threats\u201d to the UK. Is the US heading for a recession? Ahead of the GDP figures later, UBS concludes it is not. Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management said: Financial markets are right to be concerned about a slowdown in the world\u2019s largest economy. We expect just 1.5% growth for the US this year, reflecting a contraction in manufacturing activity, tighter credit conditions, the effects of a strong dollar in weaker international markets, and wealth losses due to recent stock market volatility. But markets would be wrong, in our view, to assume that this deceleration represents the start of a recession. Unemployment is under 5%. Average hourly earnings are growing at their fastest pace since 2009. Mortgage rates are just 3.7%, and gasoline prices are the cheapest they\u2019ve been in years. Household debt relative to GDP has dropped a full 20 percentage points over the past six years. These factors should enable real disposable incomes to increase at a sufficient pace to sustain consumption growth, and keep the US out of recession. Furthermore, with unemployment now so low, improved wage-bargaining power should translate into continued income growth, even if jobs growth slows from last year\u2019s 221,000 per month pace. Overall, it would be highly unusual for the US economy to contract against a backdrop of such strong labor markets. There seems to be a bit of playing down G20 expectations going on. Reuters is quoting a senior US Treasury official saying meetings like the G20 are for the gradual shifting of policies, and 20 economies can not be driven from a central meeting. Earlier the head of Italy\u2019s central bank said the most important aim of the meeting wsa to improve the ability to stimulate growth. But he added, according to Reuters, that we should \u201cnot expect concrete action to come from the G20 meeting.\u201d Here\u2019s our report on the latest developments in the London Stock Exchange\u2019s proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse: The planned merger of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) with Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse will result in a combined company with its main public listing in the UK capital. LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet is set to retire and his Deutsche B\u00f6rse counterpart Carsten Kengeter will take the same role at the new company, according to further details of the proposed merged released on Friday. It emerged on Tuesday that the LSE is in talks about an all-share merger with its German rival which would result in a group worth over \u00a321bn. In Friday\u2019s statement the LSE said the new combined group will be a UK plc domiciled in London, with headquarters in both the British capital and Frankfurt. The board will have equal numbers from each business, a move that was expected. Rolet, who has been credited with rejuvenating the company and embarking on an acquisition spree, will step down. The combined company will seek a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange and a prime standard listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Full story here: Here are the gainers and losers so far on the FTSE 100: More on eurozone inflation: Although most European markets look set for a fall over the month - the FTSEurofirst 300 is currently down 3% in February - the London market has edged marginally higher. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The FTSE-100 is charging higher again at the open, paced by a strong finish in Wall Street last night and the fact we\u2019ve seen no repeat of that big down leg in Chinese stocks, but it\u2019s worth noting that the London index is only just back to where we started the month. As we run down to the weekend break, it\u2019s looking relatively quiet in terms of the domestic economic calendar although German inflation and US GDP readings could provide some broad direction. Any further signals out of the G20 meeting in Shanghai which runs again tomorrow will also gave the ability to shift sentiment \u2013 February may look as if it\u2019s going to conclude on an upbeat note, but it\u2019s certainly been a wild ride to get here. Meanwhile consumer confidence in the UK fell to a 14 month low in February, while export orders fell sharply in the last quarter of 2015, according to new figures out this morning. Katie Allen reports: We have known for some time that the UK economy has been largely relying on consumer spending for growth - something confirmed in Thursday\u2019s GDP figures. Economists are warning that\u2019s a dangerous position to be in given that households\u2019 real incomes look set to slow this year. On top of that, there are fears that the EU referendum and ongoing global economic gloom will prompt consumers to rein in spending over coming months. Fresh figures out today suggest Britons are already becoming more cautious about the economic outlook. Consumer confidence fell to a 14-month low in February as people became more worried about the state of the UK economy and about its prospects over the next 12 months, according to market research company GfK. Its monthly confidence barometer, taking in the views of 2,000 people, also showed that consumers were less confident about making big purchases such as furniture or electrical goods. But consumer remained upbeat about their personal financial situation. \u201cDespite the positive impact of continued low interest rates and subdued inflation on our day-to-day household budgets, the feeble outlook for growth and a variety of economic uncertainties since the start of the year has depressed our New Year optimism,\u201d says Joe Staton at GfK. Separate figures on exporters also point to more challenging times ahead. Export sales and orders across both manufacturing and services sectors fell significantly in the last quarter of 2015, according to this morning\u2019s report from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and DHL. \u201cBritish exporters have faced considerable challenges in recent months. Slowing growth in China and the US, along with the continued weakness in the eurozone, have made it harder for firms to build momentum,\u201d said BCC director general John Longworth. Labour has seized on the BCC report to argue the UK needed a new industrial strategy to tackle challenges around access to finance, skills and infrastructure. \u201cThese figures show that George Osborne has been asleep at the wheel, he\u2019s leaving our economy insufficiently resilient to advancing global threats and not in a high-enough state of readiness to seize on the fast-approaching opportunities to make sure that Britain benefits most,\u201d said Kevin Brennan MP, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for trade, investment and intellectual property. UK chancellor George Osborne has been speaking to the BBC on the referendum and the prospect of Brexit: The French deflation figure of course puts more pressure on the European Central Bank to provide further stimulus at its meeting next month, since it is well shy of its inflation target. ECB president Mario Draghi has already promised he will not hesitate to act, and he may well have to. The recent rally is indeed continuing, with European markets making a bright start on the last trading day of the week. The FTSE 100 has jumped 1% or 64 points to 6077, despite an 8% slump in Royal Bank of Scotland following its figures. Germany\u2019s Dax has opened up 1.5%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed 1.1% and the FTSEEurofirst 300 has risen 0.8%. Elsewhere the London Stock Exchange has just said that following its proposed merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse, the combined group would be a UK plc domiciled in London. The news is likely to help appease some fears that the German exchange was gaining greater control of the business. But Carsten Kengeter, the German banker running the Frankfurt exchange, will become chief executive. The group also said it was setting up a joint committee to look at the implications of the UK referendum on Europe. But first we have French fourth quarter GDP, which is better than expected. The economy grew by 0.3% in the final three months of the year compared to the previous quarter, which has been revised up from the initial estimate of 0.2%. The INSEE statistics agency said consumer spending and household investment fell less than had previously expected, Reuters reported. Meanwhile French consumer prices fell 0.1% in February, pushing the 12 month inflation rate into negative territory, down -1% compared to estimates of an increase of 1%. Here\u2019s the schedule for the main economic data due later: 10.00 am (GMT) Eurozone consumer confidence 13.00 pm German consumer price index 13.30 pm US GDP (fourth quarter) As far as the US figures are concerned, the second reading of GDP is expected to see a revision down from 0.7% to 0.4%. Royal Bank of Scotland is the latest bank to report its results, and it has announced a \u00a32bn loss, its eighth consecutive year of losses. But chief executive Ross McEwan still received a pay package of \u00a33.9m. Our full story is here: Global markets are being buoyed again by hopes of more stimulus from central banks and reports that oil producers will meet again to discuss the slump in crude prices. As G20 finance ministers meet in Shanghai, the head of China\u2019s central bank hinted the country was preparing to launch another round of stimulus as he sought to reassure the financial markets about the country\u2019s flagging economy. Our full story is here: Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: The recent rebound in the yuan does appear to have assuaged concerns that the Chinese appear intent on sharply devaluing their currency, however given the timing and location of this week\u2019s meeting, it seems to me merely good policy to avoid criticism from fellow G20 members. It would not be unexpected to see the yuan start sliding again once this weekend\u2019s meeting is in the rear view mirror. The recent call by the IMF earlier this week, followed by the OECD this morning, for the G20 to take bold action at their meeting this weekend could also be a factor behind the rebound in the latter part of this week, at a time when data showed that global trade slowed sharply in 2015, led largely by a slowdown in emerging markets. But he added: It is highly unlikely that the G20 finance ministers will be able to deliver on anything more substantial than mere warm words and empty rhetoric, though I\u2019m sure UK officials will somehow be able to shoehorn a mention into the statement about the risks of a \u201cBrexit\u201d as \u201cProject fear\u201d continues to get ramped up by the various vested interests in the global economy as well as big business. Indeed the Financial Times is reporting (\u00a3) that US chancellor George Osborne is pressing for the G20 to warn of the dangers of Brexit in its official communique due on Saturday. Meanwhile Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said central banks had not run out of ammunition to boost the global economy, as was sometimes suggested, but he also called on the G20 to adopt more positive measures to help growth. So ahead of a raft of data later, notably US GDP figures, markets are continuing their recent rally, with the NIkkei up 0.3% and the Hang Seng 1.8% better. In China the CSI300 is up 1%. European markets are also expected to open higher: This follows a 1.2% gain overnight on Wall Street, as crude prices climbed on reports that Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Russia planned to meet next month. But any major deal seems unlikely following this week\u2019s comments from Saudi suggesting oil producers would not cut production.",

The bank will be slightly relieved to see that consumers\u2019 inflation expectations picked up to a 7-month high in February, although they were still well below long-term norms. Furthermore, pricing expectations rose slightly for retailers and were stable among retailers. However, they weakened among manufacturers</p> <p>In addition to the marked drop in Eurozone consumer and business confidence in February, pressure for appreciable ECB stimulus in March has been ramped up by early Eurozone consumer price data for February which suggests that a return to deflation is very possible as a consequence of lower oil, commodity and food prices. Specifically, Spanish deflation widened sharply to 0.9% in February (the sharpest since last October) from 0.4% in January while France saw consumer prices fall 0.1% year-on-year after an increase of 0.1% in January.</p> <p>There is clearly now a very real risk that the Eurozone returned to deflation in February despite consumer price inflation rising to an eight-month high of 0.3% in January. While this would be primarily due to lower oil and commodity prices, it would likely reinforce ECB concerns about potential second round effects on wages and price setting.</p> <p>We expect the ECB to trim its deposit rate by a further 10 basis points to -0.40% at its March meeting and believe it could very well step up its monthly purchase of assets (perhaps by \u20ac20bn-\u20ac30bn from the current level of \u20ac60bn. There are reports that the ECB is considering introducing a double tier on its deposit rate in order to ease the pressure on banks\u2019 profitability from another cut. The higher negative rate would only be charged on banks\u2019 deposits with the ECB above a certain level</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d028f0e4b0bd5a0524cb80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-26T10:31:55.586Z\">10.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Will the weak confidence data mean consumers and businesses keep their hands in their pockets? Bert Colijn at ING Bank says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Economic sentiment... was worse than analysts expected and reflects the somber mood about the Eurozone economy in the beginning of the year, although the indicator is still above its long-term average. The weak external environment is clearly impacting the business sector, as both manufacturing and services indicated weakening sentiment. Consumers even experienced the largest one-month drop in confidence since 2012. Both businesses and consumers are clearly spooked by concerns about the strength of the global economy and financial markets, geopolitical risks and a looming Brexit.</p> <p>For manufacturing, the global weakness is impacting current business, as orders, production and exports went down. The service sector indicated in this survey that recent demand was actually better than in January, but that expectations about future demand went down.</p> <p>Without any hard data for the first quarter, it is difficult to say how the downbeat survey results translate to output growth. Will consumers and businesses act on their negative sentiment or in other words: are they walking the walk or just talking the talk? Last summer, consumer confidence declined on the latest leg of the Greek crisis and the Chinese stock market crash, but consumption growth accelerated in the third quarter. With unemployment coming down, oil prices low and a weak euro, quite a few conditions for growth are benign, but large downside risks remain apparent. In a sense, the Eurozone currently resembles a 50-year old overweight smoker: there are a lot of downside risks, but the base case for the short-term remains fairly decent.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56d028c3e4b0d38537b1f5f4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-02-26T10:28:37.403Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/samueltombs/status/703161147449434114\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">EC Econ Sentiment Index for UK, covering whole-econ, fell in Feb to 31-month low &amp; below EU ave.

Ahead of the GDP figures later, UBS concludes it is not.</p> <p>Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Financial markets are right to be concerned about a slowdown in the world\u2019s largest economy. We expect just 1.5% growth for the US this year, reflecting a contraction in manufacturing activity, tighter credit conditions, the effects of a strong dollar in weaker international markets, and wealth losses due to recent stock market volatility.</p> <p>But markets would be wrong, in our view, to assume that this deceleration represents the start of a recession. Unemployment is under 5%. Average hourly earnings are growing at their fastest pace since 2009. Mortgage rates are just 3.7%, and gasoline prices are the cheapest they\u2019ve been in years. Household debt relative to GDP has dropped a full 20 percentage points over the past six years.

On top of that, there are fears that the EU referendum and ongoing global economic gloom will prompt consumers to rein in spending over coming months.<br></p> <p>Fresh figures out today suggest Britons are already becoming more cautious about the economic outlook. Consumer confidence fell to a 14-month low in February as people became more worried about the state of the UK economy and about its prospects over the next 12 months, according to market research company GfK. Its monthly confidence barometer, taking in the views of 2,000 people, also showed that consumers were less confident about making big purchases such as furniture or electrical goods. But consumer remained upbeat about their personal financial situation.<br></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0cd560e767866e0f46d12a512e9fc2ad8c00b1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0cd560e767866e0f46d12a512e9fc2ad8c00b1f/0_0_4368_2622/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DFS sofa store.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DFS sofa store.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe ~ for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>\u201cDespite the positive impact of continued low interest rates and subdued inflation on our day-to-day household budgets, the feeble outlook for growth and a variety of economic uncertainties since the start of the year has depressed our New Year optimism,\u201d says Joe Staton at GfK.<br></p> <p>Separate figures on exporters also point to more challenging times ahead.

      "bodyText": "British Airways\u2019 parent company IAG saw its full-year profits soar 64% in 2015 to \u20ac1.8bn (\u00a31.4bn), helped in part by falling fuel prices. The group, which consists of Iberia, Vueling and the recent addition of Aer Lingus as well as BA, said it expected to drive up operating profits by about another \u20ac1bn in 2016. Chief executive Willie Walsh said the results far exceeded the targets originally set in 2011 when BA merged with Iberia. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s undoubtedly been a good year but it\u2019s also been challenging with extreme volatility in the currency and fuel markets. The benefits gained from lower fuel prices have been partially offset by the stronger US dollar.\u201d Fuel unit costs \u2013 calculated by distance and seats flown \u2013 have dropped 17%, he said, after the impact of hedging. Walsh said the British EU referendum would not affect IAG: \u201cWe have conducted a risk analysis of a decision to leave the EU and we don\u2019t see any material risk to our business.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re a global business and have global ambition. It\u2019s not going to alter how we look at the world.\u201d While he said IAG acknowledged that consumers had benefited from open aviation in the EU, \u201cWe think there is unlikely to be an impact on fares.\u201d He said that IAG would not, unlike Ryanair, be taking a stance on the vote: \u201cWe believe this is a position best determined by the electorate and we\u2019re not giving advice.\u201d However, Walsh said he himself was for Europe but believed it needed to be reformed. \u201cI am pro-Europe from a personal point of view \u2013 and I am Irish and see the benefits that it has brought. \u201cBut I have significant experience of dealing with the European commission for business and Europe needs to be reformed, definitely \u2013 the concept of being part of a trading area is a positive one, but it needs to change.\u201c Meanwhile, Walsh repeated his warning to the new Canadian owners of London City airport that they should not look to raise landing charges following their \u00a32bn acquisition from GIP: \u201cI\u2019m only concerned [by the deal] if they put up their prices \u2013 and they should be concerned that we won\u2019t operate so many flights from City. \u201cIf they are looking to make a return on their investment they should not rely on us having the same amount of activity ... We\u2019re not a captured customer, and our customers are very clear they have choices too.\u201d IAG announced that Javier S\u00e1nchez-Prieto has become the new chairman and chief executive of Vueling, replacing Alex Cruz, who will become chairman and chief executive of BA in April, replacing Keith Williams in charge of the British flag-carrier.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in educational publisher Pearson jumped after the company reported that a restructuring plan should deliver profits of \u00a3800m by 2018. The company\u2019s share price rose more than 5% on Friday morning after it posted full-year results for 2015 in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, although sales and operating profits were down. Last month the company announced it would cut 4,000 jobs after issuing its second profit warning in three months. The restructure will cut 10% of its global workforce. Pearson, which sold the Financial Times and its stake in the Economist last year, said sales declined in 2015 but were expected to stabilise this year before starting to grow in 2017. The drop in sales is due to declines in textbook sales in the US, where college enrolments have decreased. The company posted a 2% drop in operating profit to \u00a3723m for 2015. \u201cThe cyclical and policy challenges we face in our major markets are persisting for longer than we expected,\u201d the chief executive, John Fallon, said. Sales would start to stabilise by the end of this year and then \u201cstart to provide a modest tailwind,\u201d he added. Pearson said last month it would restructure once again to tackle pressures hitting markets from North America to South Africa after it shifted its focus to educational publishing. It said the poor performance in emerging markets would be addressed by the restructuring announced last month. Pearson said it expected adjusted operating profit to fall again this year, to between \u00a3580m and \u00a3620m, but added the restructured group should deliver profit at or above \u00a3800m in 2018. Roddy Davidson, an analyst at Shore Capital, said the results did not appear to contain any significant surprises, coming soon after January\u2019s warning of sharp profit falls in 2015 and 2016. He was encouraged to see the company intensifying its efforts to solve its financial problems.",

Normalisation, to use RBS\u2019s word, must be in view. Not exactly. As RBS recorded an eighth year in a row of losses, there was a sense of weary familiarity about it all. Williams &amp; Glyn, the 300-branch network that must be removed on the orders of the European commission, is still hanging around being \u201ccomplex\u201d. When Brussels made its state-aid ruling in 2009, extraction was expected to take four years. Now RBS says this \u201ctop priority\u201d will not be achieved by the revised deadline of the first quarter of next year. Instead it is \u201ccommitted\u201d to the end of next year, which is not quite the same thing as saying separation will definitely happen by then. Unfortunately, there is no chance of handing any excess capital to shareholders while W&amp;G is still in the stable. That is one reason why the shares fell 9% to a new three-year low on Friday morning. Another contributor was lack of news on the settlement with US authorities on the sale of mortgage-backed securities. The timing on that one is entirely outside RBS\u2019 control, but it\u2019s a multi-billion uncertainty. The hit could be \u00a32bn but might be \u00a36bn.

Presumably because RBS is embarrassed by the table in the annual report that shows McEwan earning more last year than Hester ever did. To be fair to McEwan and RBS, it\u2019s hard to point to anything strategic they should be doing differently. It\u2019s just an extremely hard graft. Let\u2019s give some credit. McEwan has abolished \u201cteaser\u201d rates on credit cards, setting an honourable example that no other major bank has followed. It all helps in the slow and ill-defined process of rebuilding \u201ctrust\u201d.

When the company announced its fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, it revealed that it was still losing members.But the decline in membership slowed during the fourth quarter when Oprah Winfrey became the company\u2019s marketing partner and board member. Compared with the previous year, the number of active subscribers was down 4.8% in the fourth quarter. According to Weight Watchers, that was \u201can improvement from being down 12.7%\u201d in the third quarter compared to the year before. The number of members attending in-person meetings has dipped below one million. At the end of the fourth quarter, about 997,900 members attended meetings compared to 1.2 million in December 2013. Another 1.39 million people subscribed to Weight Watchers online program, down from 1.74 million in December 2013. Fourth quarter revenues were $259.2m. Despite the declining membership figures, Weight Watchers CEO Jim Chambers remained optimistic about the weight-loss program\u2019s future. \u201cWith the launch of Beyond the Scale and SmartPoints earlier this winter, we introduced an entirely new Weight Watchers program, which is resonating with consumers,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe partnership with Oprah Winfrey is off to a strong start. Our transformation momentum is building, with positive recruitments this winter season setting a solid foundation for revenue growth and increased profitability.\u201d After Weight Watchers announced its partnership with Winfrey, she announced \u201cin her own words\u201d why she joined its program. Chambers said her announcement was \u201cdirect and emotional\u201d and that Winfrey connected with members and non-members. He also pointed out that Winfrey has shared updates and anecdotes on social media. \u201cI. Love. Bread. I now just manage it, so I don\u2019t deny myself bread.

I lost 26 pounds and I have eaten bread every single day.\u201d Winfrey also hosted a conference call with 4,000 subscribers, which was later listened to on replay by another 8,000 subscribers, said Chambers. He added that Winfrey has been an active board member sharing ideas with the company. \u201cWe are just scratching the surface\u201d on Winfrey\u2019s engagement, he said. On the call with investors, Chambers also pointed out a recent report by Indiana University School of Medicine researchers that showed that Weight Watcher program with a prediabetes-specific component helps adults with prediabetes lose more weight and have better blood glucose control program than if they tried to lose weight on their own. Such \u201cscience-based evidence\u201d could help Weight Watchers break into \u201ccorporate wellness market\u201d, said Chambers.",

The company reported operating profits of \u00a3291.4m for last year, down from \u00a3372.2m in 2014. It said additional gambling duties of \u00a387m resulted in the slump. \u201cIn profit terms, 2015 was always going to be a challenging year as the group faced substantial additional gambling taxes on its UK online and retail businesses, and group operating profit declined 22% to \u00a3291.4m,\u201d it said. The bookmaker announced a share buyback of \u00a3200m over the next 12 months. The dividend was increased by 2.5% despite falls in profits. It also committed to paying all employees the national living wage of \u00a37.20 an hour from 1 April. William Hill warned last October that its annual profits would range near the bottom of forecasts after poor sports results \u2013 too many favourites winning races \u2013 affected retail businesses in the UK, the US and Australia. The company is the largest bookmaker in the UK with 2,370 betting shops. Revenues were down by 1% to \u00a31.59bn in 2015 as there was no major football tournament during the year as well as the poor sports results, said the company. Last year saw significant regulatory and taxation changes in the gambling industry. The government introduced a point of consumption tax in December 2014, as well as increasing the duty on machine games from 20% to 25%.

      "bodyText": "The planned merger of the London Stock Exchange with Germany\u2019s Deutsche B\u00f6rse will result in a company with its main public listing in the UK capital. The LSE\u2019s chief executive, Xavier Rolet, is set to retire and his Deutsche B\u00f6rse counterpart, Carsten Kengeter will take the same role at the combined company, according to further details of the proposed merged released on Friday. It emerged on Tuesday that the LSE was in talks about an all-share merger with its German rival that would result in a group worth more than \u00a321bn. In Friday\u2019s statement the LSE said the combined group would be a UK plc domiciled in London, with headquarters in the British capital and Frankfurt. After two previous attempts at joining forces stretching back more than 15 years, the pair announced a planned \u201cmerger of equals\u201d on Tuesday and said they were confident that regulatory and other concerns that had scuppered those deals would not prove their undoing this time. The board will have equal numbers from each business, a move that was expected. Rolet, who has been credited with rejuvenating the company and embarking on an acquisition spree, will step down. The combined company will seek a premium listing on the LS E and a prime standard listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The exchanges have considered combining forces before. They agreed to merge in 2000 before a rival bid for the LSE from Sweden\u2019s OM Gruppen scuppered the deal, which was then rejected anyway. The LSE then rejected a formal \u00a31.3bn offer from Deutsche B\u00f6rse in January 2005. Along with Kengeter as chief executive, the chairman of the LSE, Donald Brydon, was announced as chairman of the combined company; Joachim Faber of Deutsche B\u00f6rse as deputy chairman and David Warren, chief financial officer of the LSE, will hold the same position in the new company. Rolet, a French national who has become part of the City establishment, will step down on completion of the transaction, said the statement. \u201cXavier has been the architect of LSEG\u2019s considerable value creation and has offered to retire in order to ensure the successful creation of the new group,\u201d Brydon said. Given the British referendum on EU membership in June, the firms said a joint committee had been set up to advise on the implications of a vote to leave. The two sought to reassure investors on Friday that their merger would prosper regardless of the outcome, even if the volume of trade in London and Frankfurt changed. \u201cAccordingly, the outcome of the referendum would not be a condition of the potential merger,\u201d they said. Peter Thorne, analyst at Edison Investment Research, agreed a Brexit vote was unlikely to affect the deal as the financial infrastructure business and regulation are increasingly global. \u201cBut Brexit is a political process so financial logic may not be the only concern. The referendum committee seems a necessary precaution,\u201d he said. The firms also said they expected a \u201csignificant opportunity\u201d for revenue synergies after the deal and would set out further details of what these might be in due course. In the statement announcing the details, the boards of the companies said the proposed merger \u201cwould represent a compelling opportunity for both companies to strengthen each other in an industry-defining combination, creating a leading European-based global markets infrastructure group\u201d. Cost savings could be made as a result of sharing technology and operations resources, the company added. A deal would combine the LSE\u2019s share-trading operation with the derivatives trading of Deutsche B\u00f6rse\u2019s Eurex in a group worth more than \u00a321bn. It would propel the companies to a similar scale as US exchange ICE, which has taken a huge slice of the European derivatives markets.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has defended a \u00a33.8m pay deal for its chief executive after reporting a \u00a32bn annual loss and falling into the red for the eighth consecutive year. Shares in the bank slumped as RBS dampened expectations that it will start returning cash to shareholders as soon as the beginning of next year. The shares closed down 7% at 226.6p, below the 502p at which taxpayers break even on their 73% stake. The pay packet for RBS boss Ross McEwan was the highest for a chief executive of the bank since its 2008 bailout, with 121 employees also receiving more than \u20ac1m (\u00a3790,000) during the year. The chairman, Sir Howard Davies, said the doubling in pay for McEwan \u2013 a New Zealander who took the helm two years ago \u2013 was \u201cappropriate and justified\u201d, and pointed out that his peers were earning more. However, the results for 2015 pushed the bank\u2019s losses since the bailout to \u00a350bn, more than the \u00a345bn pumped in by taxpayers during its bailout. McEwan also warned of a \u201cnoisy\u201d year to come in which the bank faces a multimillion pound penalty for the sale of mortgage bonds in the US in the run-up to the financial crisis, and another \u00a31bn of costs to restructure the bank. Its annual report also warned of the increased \u201ceconomic and operational uncertainty\u201d from the forthcoming referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union. \u201cThe result may also give rise to further political uncertainty regarding Scottish independence. RBS actively monitors, and considers responses to, varying EU referendum outcomes to ensure that it is well prepared for all eventualities,\u201d said the Edinburgh-based bank. Davies said the bank would be able to survive any economic downturn that followed Brexit and said the board had not been under any influence from the government in forming its view. The senior executives at the bank, including McEwan, do not receive annual bonuses, in an attempt to defuse the rows over pay that have characterised RBS since its bailout. Other employees do, however, and that bonus pool was down 11% to \u00a3373m. McEwan\u2019s pay included \u00a31m of the allowances that have been put in place in the wake of an EU bonus cap, although he will give half of that to charity after acknowledging the bank still had more work to do. The bank also disclosed a \u00a32.1m payment to Stephen Hester, his predecessor who was forced out in 2013, from long-term pay schemes. The annual losses were caused by \u00a32.9bn of restructuring charges and \u00a33.5bn of litigation and conduct costs. This included \u00a3334m relating to investigations into foreign exchange rigging, \u00a3157m for packaged bank accounts and \u00a32.1bn related to mortgage bonds in the US. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said RBS was the Jekyll and Hyde of the UK banking sector. \u201cOn the one hand the bank is downsizing, de-risking and cost-cutting, while at the same time conduct charges are playing havoc with overall profitability,\u201d he said. McEwan also set a new target to save \u00a3800m in 2016 that could result in some job cuts. In legal warnings it outlined a string of potential worries, including an ongoing court case from investors who backed a cash call before its 2008 taxpayer bailout, court cases in the US involving Libor-rigging, cases accusing the bank of funding terrorists and the risk of court cases from business customers sold interest rate swaps. It also disclosed it would be writing to customers later this year to establish if they had been mis-sold pension and insurance products. The fall in the shares took place after the bank admitted that its attempts to start making dividend payments to shareholders had been pushed back from the first quarter of 2017. This is because it needs to spin off 300 branches under the Williams &amp; Glyn brand \u2013 a sale mandated by the EU following its bailout \u2013 and settle the US cases over the sales of mortgage bonds. Even so, the bank is paying back the so-called dividend access share it sold to the government during the crisis, which prevented any shareholders receiving dividends before the government. This will cost more than \u00a31bn to repay this year. While the figures appeared to make it more difficult for the chancellor, George Osborne, to sell off the remaining stake in the bank, Davies said: \u201cI do believe there is, at the core of this, a good profitable bank.\u201d He said that while it was impossible to know if the government would get all its money back, it \u201cwill get quite a lot back\u201d. Lloyds Banking Group shares continued to rise \u2013 after its promise on Thursday of bigger returns for shareholders \u2013 to close the week at 72.1p, just below the 73.6p breakeven point for taxpayers.",

    "webTitle": "Ofcom tells BT to open up infrastructure to rivals", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BT has been told to help rivals use its infrastructure to lay fibre cables that are faster than its own copper network, as part of a review of Britain\u2019s broadband needs by the regulator Ofcom. In a once in a decade review, the regulator stopped short of recommending that BT be forced to split off Openreach, the division that owns the broadband infrastructure. The verdict drew criticism from TalkTalk and Sky, who said Ofcom had not gone far enough. TalkTalk\u2019s boss, Dido Harding, said splitting Openreach from BT entirely would ensure \u201cBT isn\u2019t the one making the decisions on whether or not there is more money in Openreach and that\u2019s exactly why I think they should be separate\u201d. Harding also said it was \u201cdeeply suspicious\u201d that BT boss Gavin Patterson has pledged to spend more on Openreach in the run-up to the decision. \u201cIndependence would mean that Openreach makes the right decisions for their customers rather than the decisions that are right for BT Group,\u201d she added. A Sky spokesperson said: \u201cWe believe the simplest and most effective way to fix the current broken market structure is for Openreach to be completely independent. We are pleased to see that separation is still on the table.\u201d The Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said Ofcom had \u201cbottled it\u201d and called on the government to force a full split. Ofcom\u2019s more moderate proposal would see the network run at \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d, it said, with separate people making decisions on its budget, investment and strategy. This would \u201cremove the incentive and ability to discriminate against competing providers\u201d. Chief executive Sharon White conceded this could also involve an unusual situation in which the likes of Sky and TalkTalk get a seat on the Openreach board. But Ofcom left open the possibility of revisiting the nuclear option of full separation if BT did not comply on key issues. It said this might prove to be the \u201ccleanest and most clear cut long-term solution\u201d. One source familiar with the situation said this was not a negotiating tactic to force BT\u2019s hand, adding that full separation was \u201cunequivocally not off the table\u201d. White said it was no \u201cairy-fairy\u201d threat, insisting Ofcom was prepared to revisit the idea of full separation, which it deems too costly and complicated, if BT does not cooperate. The BT chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said: \u201cA great deal of what they are proposing is already in place and we are open to discussions about how the current rules can be amended and updated.\u201d Ofcom also gave a series of recommendations to improve customers\u2019 experience. These include automatic compensation for customers and businesses when the Openreach network experiences problems. The regulator wants to introduce league tables and make it easier for customers to switch provider. The regulator also wants greater transparency on what Openreach is doing, amid complaints of poor service by BT and claims by rivals that being forced to use the network puts them at a disadvantage. Ofcom said Openreach directors should be forced to consult customers \u2013 such as Sky and TalkTalk \u2013 on its investment plans and provide more information about how it allocates costs and assets. It should also build a database of its telegraph poles and ducts, to allow rivals to plan where they might want to lay ultrafast fibre to compete with BT\u2019s copper network. Rivals already have access to BT\u2019s infrastructure but the regulator plans to make it less expensive for them to use. Patterson cast doubt on whether rivals would take up the offer, despite complaining of the slow pace of fibre roll-out. \u201cOur ducts and poles have been open to competitors since 2009 but there has been little very interest to date. We will see if that now changes,\u201d he said. The regulator also wants to introduce tougher minimum service requirements to make sure BT repairs faults more quickly, an area in which rivals say it is dragging its feet. Ofcom said BT could be fined \u201chundreds of millions of pounds\u201d if it fails to meet obligations, adding that the performance of its copper network was currently \u201con a knife edge\u201d. There will also be a new government-backed universal obligation to provide fast broadband to every home and business in the UK, starting at 10 megabits per second. Although Ofcom does not have powers to impose any changes on BT immediately, it can take its plans to the European commission for approval. At that point it can impose its recommendations on the telecoms giant. \u201cA voluntary, binding settlement is in everyone\u2019s interests and we will work hard to ensure one is reached,\u201d said Patterson. Ofcom\u2019s chief executive, Sharon White, said: \u201cPeople across the UK today need affordable, reliable phone and broadband services. Coverage and quality are improving, but not fast enough to meet the growing expectations of consumers and businesses. \u201cSo today we\u2019ve announced fundamental reform of the telecoms market \u2013 more competition, a new structure for Openreach, tougher performance targets, and a range of measures to boost service quality. Together, this means a better deal for telecoms users, which will improve the services and networks that underpin how we live and work.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The head of China\u2019s central bank has dropped a strong hint that Beijing is preparing to launch another round of stimulus as he sought to reassure the financial markets about the country\u2019s flagging economy. China had more room and tools in its monetary policy to tackle downward pressure in the economy, and its fiscal policy would be more proactive, central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said on Friday. Zhou, speaking at a conference held by the Institute of International Finance in Shanghai in conjunction with a G20 meeting of central bank governors and finance ministers, also said that the direction of China\u2019s reforms would not change, but that the pace might change. \u201cWhile the reform direction is clear, managing the reform pace will need windows (of opportunity) and conditions ... The pace will vary, but the reform will be set to continue and the direction is not changed,\u201d Zhou said in English. At the same time, policy makers need to strike a balance between growth, restructuring and managing risks to the economy. Zhou\u2019s comments helped stock markets rise around Asia with Chinese shares rising strongly a day after falling more than 6%. The Shanghai Composite index was up 0.54% at 3.15am GMT on Friday while the CSI300 index of leading Shanghai and Shenzhen shares was up 0.78%. In Japan the falling cost of fuel kept inflation at 0%, well below the central bank\u2019s target of 2% and highlighting the daunting task policymakers face in attempting to lift Japan out of stagnation. However, the Nikkei rose 1.2% helped by gains on Wall Street and the ASX/S&amp;P200 in Australia was up 0.2%. In a bid to end speculation about a possible devaluation of the yuan, Zhou added that there was no basis for persistent depreciation of China\u2019s yuan and that foreign reserves would be kept at \u201cadequate\u201d levels. Later he said that the world was overly concerned about the state of China\u2019s $3 trillion foreign reserves and whether it could protect the yuan from increasing capital flight. But Angus Nicholson of online trader IG said that Zhou\u2019s comments were contradictory because any monetary easing would increase pressure on the yuan and therefore foreign reserves. \u201cWhile all of these statements are reassuring to the market, only two out of three of those statements can be true in the long term,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201cIf there is further monetary policy easing, the pressure for further yuan depreciation will sap foreign reserves if the currency isn\u2019t allowed to weaken. \u201cWhile China has the means to pause the exchange rate at current levels for a few months, once FX reserves drop below US$3 trillion, it is only a matter of time before a major one-off devaluation becomes the best course of action.\u201d But as global financial markets continued to fret about the real state of China\u2019s economy \u2013 IMF chief Christine Lagarde told delegates that the country faced an \u201coverwhelming\u201d structural reform agenda \u2013 the bank said in a later statement that its economic fundamentals remained sound and there were signs of demand picking up again. China has cut interest rates six times since November 2014 in an effort to stimulate its economy which last year grew at its slowest rate for 25 years. Although the last of those rate cuts was in October, Beijing has resorted to a variety of other methods to encourage growth and expand credit, including by increasing bank liquidity and massaging reserve requirements. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, told delegates in Shanghai that the G20 had failed to do enough to boost global growth and he rejected suggestions that central banks had run out of options to respond to continued slow growth. \u201cSeveral commentators are peddling the myth that monetary policy is \u2018out of ammunition\u2019. This is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed,\u201d Carney said. The Bank of Japan recently joined the European Central Bank, the Danish central bank, the Swedish Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank in cutting rates to below zero to rescue their economies from deflation and the prospect of recession.",

      "bodyText": "Woolworths has announced a $1bn loss in the first half and appointed a new chief executive to revive the business. The company\u2019s decision in January to pull the plug on its Masters hardware chain will cost $3.25bn before tax in a one-off impairment. Shareholders will take a $972.7m hit, it said in its first half results on Friday. Revenue from Australian food, liquor and petrol declined 2.58% to $24.96bn, thanks mainly to falling oil prices affecting the pump prices. Profits before one-off charges were down 33%. The man appointed to fix the mess is Brad Banducci who will take over immediately from the outgoing chief executive, Grant O\u2019Brien. Banducci has been running Woolworths\u2019 supermarkets division and before that was boss of the Dan Murphy\u2019s liquor stores. Woolworths had been looking for a chief executive since June, when O\u2019Brien said he was quitting after his plan to revive the business failed. \u201cWe undertook a rigorous international search process to find the best person to rebuild the Woolworths business and return it to sustainable growth,\u201d said the chairman, Gordon Cairns. \u201cWhile there were several strong candidates, the board was unanimous that Brad was the strongest of the field.\u201d Banducci faces a tough task with Woolworths admitting in its statement to the ASX that it saw no improvement in supermarket sales amid fierce competition from Coles and discounters such as Aldi. \u201cDespite the financial performance, we are making progress in the rebuilding of Woolworths,\u201d the ASX statement said. But: \u201cWe are not anticipating a significant improvement in comparable sales in Australian supermarkets in the second half with the market likely to remain competitive and price deflation likely to continue.\u201d Woolworths announced in January that it was going to sell or close the Masters chain after losses became unsustainable. The retailer has poured nearly $4bn into Masters since 2009 in an attempt to eat into the profits made by its rival Wesfarmers from Australia\u2019s number one hardware chain, Bunnings. But the 63-strong chain \u2013 a joint venture with the US retailer Lowe\u2019s \u2013 has been a constant drain on Woolworths which has also struggled to compete in the supermarket price war.",

      "bodyText": "Household energy prices are set to jump in New South Wales after a tribunal overturned a regulator\u2019s decision to cut prices charged by electricity networks. The decision also has national implications, and is likely to result in more expensive power bills in at least the ACT and Victoria. In 2015 the Australian Energy Regulator ruled electricity network operators in NSW had overestimated their required expenditure, and so forced them to charge consumers less. That resulted in a drop in energy bills of between $100 and $300 a year. Endeavour Energy, Essential Energy and Ausgrid challenged the decision, saying their costs were more than $5bn higher than the regulator estimated. The Public Interest Advocacy Centre, representing consumers, also appealed the decision, saying the regulator had overestimated the costs by more than $2bn. In a federal court in Darwin, the Australian competition tribunal ruled in favour of the networks, but referred the case back to the regulator to determine the details. Since it accepted the network\u2019s arguments that they should be able to charge more, the court did not address the advocacy centre\u2019s appeal directly. The decision, if implemented, will cause a sharp jump in people\u2019s electricity bills, said Oliver Derum from the centre. \u201cThe price cut will be removed,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the money \u2013 between $150 and $300 per household that we\u2019re enjoying at the moment \u2013 not only will that be reversed and probably in the end increase, but the money that they\u2019ve under-recovered this year will be rolled in.\u201d Since the decision covers the period from 2014 to 2019, the networks\u2019 changes will have a retrospective effect, meaning they will recover the money they missed out on after the price cuts were implemented. Also, because the tribunal agreed with many of the network\u2019s arguments about how to calculate the cost of efficiently running the network, prices are likely to jump by even more. \u201cConsumers will be very lucky to escape price rises that aren\u2019t in the hundreds of dollars,\u201d Derum said. The 2015 price drop occurred partly as part of an attempt to stamp out the practice of \u201cgold plating\u201d, where owners and operators of electricity grids overinvested in infrastructure. Operators of electricity grids have a monopoly so they could just recover the costs by passing them on to consumers. As a result, energy prices doubled in New South Wales since 2008. In 2013 new federal laws were introduced that changed the way the regulator calculated how much the operators could charge customers, leading to the price drop. \u201cThe law was changed in 2013 to give the regulator new powers to bring fairness to the electricity price-setting process, following price increases of 94% over five years. The tribunal\u2019s decision makes it harder to bring about a fair result,\u201d the advocacy centre\u2019s chief executive, Edward Santow, said. Because NSW was the first state to challenge the way the laws were implemented, operators from the ACT and Victoria also intervened in the case. The decision about how to estimate fair network costs will have implications in those states, too. \u201cThe [Public Interest Advocacy Centre\u2019s] appeal was the first time a consumer group has argued for a price decrease before the tribunal,\u201d said Santow. \u201cWhile the outcome is disappointing, [the centre] has paved the way for future successful consumer appeals, and we will be exploring all our options to continue to fight for fair energy prices for NSW consumers.\u201d Paula Conboy, chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, said: \u201cWe are considering the implications the tribunal\u2019s decisions will have both for the revenue that the businesses will be allowed to recover from consumers in NSW and ACT, and the prices those consumers will have to pay, as well as our processes for future determinations.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The supermarket chain Asda has announced a policy U-turn that will see the return of permanent collection points for food banks and other charities in all its UK stores. The move comes after the Guardian broke the news that the collection points were being removed across Britain. Some food banks said the move would threaten 25% of their supplies, while the Trussell Trust food bank network warned of losses of food of up to a third. A source inside the company said that news of Asda\u2019s change-of-heart began to circulate internally on Wednesday 24 February. The Guardian has seen material from Asda\u2019s internal social network The Green Room indicating disquiet and regret among staff about the removal of the collection points and welcoming their return. A briefing released to staff on Thursday evening said: \u201cWe are reinstating all previously existing unmanned collections in store, eg Guide Dogs for the Blind collections, food banks, Marie Curie collection trays. This is about reinviting existing charity partners back into store, not about actively going out and recruiting any new unmanned collections at this stage.\u201d Asda has more than 525 UK stores and is owned by the US retailer Walmart. In response to its initial policy change, 88,000 people signed a petition hosted by the campaigning organisation 38 Degrees and a number of MPs raised concerns. While this ad hoc campaign took shape, Asda\u2019s rival Tesco announced it was installing 100 new collection points in its stores. Opposition to Asda\u2019s decision was expressed by the mayor of Liverpool, Labour\u2019s Joe Anderson, in an open letter to Asda\u2019s chief executive Andy Clarke. Anderson said he and his extended family were all regular shoppers at Asda stores, but the chain\u2019s decision meant \u201cwe can no longer consider being customers of yours, and I will publicly urge Liverpool residents and others to do the same\u201d. In response to Asda\u2019s U-turn, Anderson said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that we had to lobby a company like Asda, who are usually good contributors to good causes. But all credit to them for listening. I\u2019m just glad that they\u2019ve done the right thing and reversed the decision. \u201cI don\u2019t think they understood that this is a way of charities being there at the point that people find it easy to make a contribution. A lot of people aren\u2019t going to take their shopping home and say: \u2018I\u2019m going to take these three tins down to the local food bank\u2019. I lacked any understanding of why Asda made the decision: it was no skin off their nose.\u201d Asda, which recently announced its worst quarterly sales figures to date, denied that the change had anything to do with an ongoing programme of cost-cutting and said it was channelling an additional \u00a32m in charitable funding through the national Asda Foundation. Its initial statements about the policy change said the chain was as open as ever to charitable collections, but it thought it was essential that \u201cvolunteers are on hand to talk to customers and explain where their donations are going\u201d. Food banks said they would have serious difficulties finding volunteers to spare. The briefing confirmed another U-turn: the retention of Asda\u2019s Chosen by You scheme, whereby customers use green tokens to choose local charities to benefit from the supermarket\u2019s donations. It had been scheduled to end on 1 March. Asda said: \u201cWe made some changes to our community programme around unmanned collections in the belief that this would benefit the many local good causes who collect in our stores. \u201cOn this occasion, our customers and colleagues have told us they understand our intentions, but prefer us to continue to give charities more options to maximise donations. We are therefore reinstating unmanned collection points. \u201cAsda plays an important role in the communities we serve and we look forward to continuing to support many more local charities and good causes.\u201d Bob Ashford, the chair of trustees of the Fair Frome charity in Somerset, said: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely delighted. From the beginning, the decision didn\u2019t make sense. It was an arrangement that benefited Asda, in terms of customers buying more goods \u2013 and it benefited charities and people who use food banks because it gave them a regular supply of food. \u201cWe\u2019re a very small charity and we were one of the first to raise this. And now we\u2019ve seen a major national store change its policy.\u201d Amanda Bloomfield, the chief executive of the Gatehouse Foodbank in Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, said: \u201cMembers of the public approached us and talked about all the media coverage of Asda\u2019s decision,. \u201cThey were unhappy about it, and they wanted to know why it had been made. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be glad to know that their voices have had an influence.\u201d",

We are therefore reinstating unmanned collection points. </p> <p>\u201cAsda plays an important role in the communities we serve and we look forward to continuing to support many more local charities and good causes.\u201d</p> <p> Bob Ashford, the chair of trustees of the Fair Frome charity in Somerset, said: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely delighted. From the beginning, the decision didn\u2019t make sense. It was an arrangement that benefited Asda, in terms of customers buying more goods \u2013 and it benefited charities and people who use food banks because it gave them a regular supply of food.</p> <p> \u201cWe\u2019re a very small charity and we were one of the first to raise this. And now we\u2019ve seen a major national store change its policy.\u201d</p> <p> Amanda Bloomfield, the chief executive of the Gatehouse Foodbank in Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, said: \u201cMembers of the public approached us and talked about all the media coverage of Asda\u2019s decision,. </p> <p>\u201cThey were unhappy about it, and they wanted to know why it had been made. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be glad to know that their voices have had an influence.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bank of England boss Mark Carney has accused the G20 of failing to adopt measures to boost global growth as he defended central banks and their power to play a role in stimulating economic growth following attacks from critics who say they have run out of ammunition. Speaking at a meeting of G20 finance ministers and bank governors in Shanghai on Friday, Carney turned on City economists who say the world\u2019s major central banks have done all they can to prevent the global economy from slipping back into recession. He said: \u201cSeveral commentators are peddling the myth that monetary policy is \u2018out of ammunition\u2019. This is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed.\u201d The Bank of Japan recently joined the European Central Bank, the Danish central bank, the Swedish Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank in cutting rates to below zero to rescue their economies from deflation and the prospect of recession. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December to calm what it thought was a strongly growing US economy, but a string of poor economic figures since then has put pressure on Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, to reverse the policy at the central bank\u2019s next meeting in March. Carney has hinted that he is prepared to cut the base rate from 0.5%, but has ruled out following the trend for negative rates, saying it would damage the stability of UK banks and building societies. William White, a former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the central bankers\u2019 club, who now chairs the OECD\u2019s review committee, warned that central bankers had \u201cused up all their ammunition\u201d ahead of the World Economic Forum gathering in Davos last month. Amid steep falls in stock markets that some economists said were a sign of panic among global investors at the worsening economic outlook, he said: \u201cThe situation is worse than it was in 2007. Our macroeconomic ammunition to fight downturns is essentially all used up. \u201cDebts have continued to build up over the past eight years and they have reached such levels in every part of the world that they have become a potent cause for mischief.\u201d The BIS was one of the few organisations to warn during 2006 and 2007 about the unstable levels of bank lending that eventually led to the Lehman Brothers crash. Carney, who is also head of the G20 financial stability board, said the banking system remained strong despite the recent downturn and could withstand shocks from volatile markets. He added that central banks still had a role to play to boost lending and confidence among businesses and consumers, but politicians should not rely on cuts in interest rates and quantitative easing to turn around an \u201cunforgiving\u201d global economy. He accused G20 governments, which include the UK, US, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India and Indonesia, of failing to keep their side of a bargain that meant ending trade protections and enacting financial reforms to boost growth. \u201cAt the Brisbane summit in 2014, the G20 leaders agreed an ambitious goal to lift the level of G20 GDP by at least 2% by 2018. But only 18 months on, the two in five commitments are starting to look more like the 5/2 diet. \u201cLess than half of the measures have been implemented, and only around one third of the promised impact on global GDP has been delivered. Moreover, whilst implementation has lagged, the need to boost growth has increased in size and urgency.\u201d He said the Bank of England expects the level of global GDP in 2018 to be more than 3% below what the IMF expected at the time of the Brisbane summit. \u201cWe need to live up to China\u2019s G20 priorities: structural reforms with a long-term focus but a short-term implementation horizon, determined reform of the global architecture for sustainable capital flows and the development of our essential macroprudential frameworks and the implementation of our financial reform commitments to address new vulnerabilities.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Uncertainty over the outcome of the EU referendum is likely to slow Britain\u2019s housing market in the coming months, according to property firm Hometrack. The firm, which provides data to mortgage lenders and developers, said the number of sales in the country\u2019s 20 biggest cities had already fallen by 2% last year and activity was likely to dip further in the run-up to the 23 June vote. Hometrack\u2019s research director, Richard Donnell, said: \u201cAfter a three-year upturn in housing market activity and house prices, the outlook for the market appears increasingly tied up with policy impacts and the potential outcome of the referendum, rather than the operation of market forces. \u201cBusinesses operating in housing face risk and uncertainty which will have to be managed and monitored carefully.\u201d On Thursday, the property firm CBRE said investors and owner-occupiers were likely to behave in the same way as they did in Scotland during its 2014 independence referendum, and delay decisions until after the vote. \u201cAfter the Scotland referendum there was a \u2018catch up\u2019 effect and CBRE expects the same for the UK, assuming that it decides to remain in the EU,\u201d it said. A poll of its investor clients found that almost three-quarters felt that the UK would be a worse place to invest in if it left the EU. Activity in the housing market slowed before last year\u2019s general election, particularly in the UK\u2019s most expensive neighbourhoods, where buyers were unsure if they would face a mansion tax after June. Donnell said there was also evidence of a 10% fall in sales in Scotland in the 18 months before its independence referendum in 2014. Buyers had been concerned about the threat of businesses relocating if voters opted for independence. Donnell said a vote to remain in the EU would trigger a return to business as usual in the second half of 2016, while a vote to leave would increase uncertainty and dampen market activity over a longer period. Hometrack\u2019s latest UK cities house price index showed home values continued to rise in 2015, registering an average rise of 10.2% over the year. Double-digit price growth was recorded in London, Cambridge, Oxford and Bristol, with the average price in the capital up by 13.4% to \u00a3455,100.",
