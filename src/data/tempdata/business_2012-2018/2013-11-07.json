The ECB has just eased policy even further, while the Fed, for all its procrastinating, is still more than likely to scale back its asset purchases before too long. Furthermore, President Draghi added that rates could go even lower and that the ECB was \u201ctechnically ready\u201d to cut its deposit rate into negative territory.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we do not expect the strength of peripheral euro-zone government bonds to last just because the ECB has become more accommodative. A small cut to the refi rate will not transform the economic outlook and will not address the deep-seated problems of the peripheral countries such as their high debt burdens.</p> <p>Indeed, credit spreads on euro-zone peripheral government bonds have fallen all the way back to the sort of levels seen on comparably-rated assets outside the euro-zone. There would therefore appear to be a significant risk of a renewed rise in them over time if and when investors\u2019 concerns about these problems reappear.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <h2>Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>1) One has to always doff one's hat to Draghi for his ability to \"blag a blagger\", in rather<br>stark (sic) contrast to his predecessors, and the conservative Bundesbank type grouping<br>on the council.</p> <p>2) The timing for a rate cut is/was always key, and so the decision to \"go now\" rather<br>than roll out the red carpet for December made good sense.... but that unfortunately<br>is where the compliments stop.</p> <p>3) So to the rationale: the ECB is now expecting a \"sustained period of low inflation\",<br>but sees \"no risk of deflation\" - really? a) Does the ECB has any control over such<br>a fine dividing line, given that Eurozone CPI is 0.7% y/y? b) One might even ask whether<br>the ECB is wondering into the BoE's bad forecasting territory? and c) What happened to that<br>recent suggestion that a very low level of inflation was in fact good for (hard pressed)<br>Eurozone (above all Club Med) consumers?</p> <p>4) While he could say nothing else other than that he \"believes rate cut is effective\"<br>to then follow it up with \"some would say reduction in excess liquidity is due to less<br>fragmentation\" and, that the rate cut \"reduces fragmentation in the periphery\"<br>is pushing on a gossamer thin bit of string, the more so when he continued later<br>with this particular bit of bravado: \"fundamentals in the Eurozone are probably<br>strongest in the world\", while saying that the recovery is \"proceeding, but is weak<br>and fragile\". Which epithet of these would be best to deploy: a) paradox,<br>b) oxymoron or c) bipolar?</p> <p>5) What will this do for growth in the Eurozone economy, employment, indeed bank<br>lending - not a lot. The fact is that by cutting the income of savers, and in fact discouraging<br>bank lending by keeping long-term rates at very depressed levels, as well as tying to<br>persuade businesses and consumers that they actually do not need act now to \"lock in\"<br>super low rates, the ECB, Fed and BoE may in fact be depressing the economy, while<br>exponentially fuelling asset bubbles and widening economic and social gaps.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Mike Ingram of BGC Partners:</h2> <p><strong>Cut and Run at the ECB</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What a shocker. The market had assumed, at most, a one in ten chance of the European Central Bank (ECB) cutting rates today and yet they did just that. The ECB refinancing rate was halved to 0.25%. For today at least, European stock and bonds were euphoric and the overly strong Euro has taken a beating. Mission accomplished Mr Draghi.</p> <p>In actuality, a rate cut has only been a question of \u2018when\u2019 rather than \u2018if\u2019 for some time now. Euro zone inflation is collapsing while output gaps are large and with feeble growth, set to be persistent. Moreover credit conditions are still tightening, albeit at a slower pace and little progress has been made in bringing down lending rates in Europe\u2019s beleaguered periphery. To top it all, the Euro has been strong \u2013 defying the consensus call of a strong dollar. Taken together, I wasn\u2019t kidding when I recently suggested that large swathes of the Euro zone are becoming eerily reminiscent of 1990\u2019s Japan.</p> <p>And yet most of us have been wrong-footed today. (I included, I thought the Bank would wait for more data before cutting in December). In defence I can only say that even as the economic case for a rate cut became compelling, Team Draghi seem infuriatingly relaxed about the need to ease policy further. Now they have belatedly leapt into action.</p> <p>So for many reasons, I approached the recently concluded ECB press conference with more than a little curiosity. And while it was another polished performance from Super Mario, I wasn\u2019t greatly comforted by what I heard either. I am now left feeling that while the ECB may no longer be horribly behind the curve, there is little chance they are ahead of it and it is only a matter of time before they are playing catch up again.</p> <p>It could have been worse of course; a late cut is better than none at all. One on the big positives was that, despite cutting rates to an all-time low, we learned that the ECB \u2018continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or&#xa0;<em>lower levels</em>&#xa0;for an extended period of time\u2019. It could easily have signalled that rates at 0.25% were an effective floor, but it didn\u2019t. Moreover, it emerged in the Q&amp;A that such forward guidance was unanimous.&#xa0;The ECB feels it still has a few rate cards left to play.</p> <p>But this seemingly definitive statement of central bank activism sits uneasily with much else that the ECB had to say this afternoon. For instance, the Euro zone inflation outlook was once again described as \u2018broadly balanced\u2019. It clearly hasn\u2019t been in the past and given significant deflationary headwinds, I suspect this remains a mistaken prognosis.</p> <p>Of more practical concern to most of us is that the ECB\u2019s take on the nascent Euro zone economic recovery also seems threadbare. Having shifted the supposed growth drivers from exports and investment early in the year, to consumption and investment in the summer (as emerging markets swooned and PMIs picked up), it is now apparently all down to consumption. Presumably this belatedly recognises that businesses in the Euro zone remain loathe to invest. Hardly a surprise given ample spare capacity and in many cases continued credit rationing. They are more likely to bolster profits by squeezing employees. If so, sayonara consumption too!</p> <p>Perhaps the most disturbing part of the ECB\u2019s performance today however, was a seemingly off the cuff remark that Mario Draghi made on the long-term outlook for the Euro zone economy. The Euro zone, he said, \u2018had some of the best fundamentals in the world\u2019. (I actually laughed out loud at that point). Mario then proceeded to reel off this secret recipe for economic success: low budget deficits and current account surpluses.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure Angela Merkel must have been overjoyed, but it strikes me that if the main thrust of economic policy is that the rest of Europe deflates against an already competitive Germany, then the outlook for Europe is grim indeed. At that point the ECB\u2019s hand may be looking quite poor \u2013 if the market doesn\u2019t call their bluff first.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So after spending a good part of the last 18 months stating that Europe would be experiencing uplift in economic fortunes right about now Mr Draghi has had to cut rates today. I found it an unconvincing and contradictory performance in the press conference and found it especially interesting that Mr Draghi basically ignored two questions on QE.</p> <p>The big question is what can the ECB do next if the worrying recent trends with regard to loan demand and inflation do not reverse. Mr Draghi stated that he had a whole range of instruments left to deal with any deteriorating situation, but the ones he mentioned were very much interest rate options. Cheap money has not yet produced any uptick in loan demand in Europe and it is difficult to see why this should change whether he alters the benchmark rate, the deposit rate or whatever. Banks continue to be in deleveraging mode and companies are not confident enough of the immediate economic outlook to invest.</p> <p>Thus if the ECB rate cuts do not stimulate loan growth or reverse falling prices then what do they do next? I think the first port of call would be to try and encourage banks to lend by offering a much longer term LTRO. Something in the region of a 7 or 10 year. After that comes QE. Yes I know there are potential legal challenges to such a move but I do believe Mr Draghi when he says he will do whatever it takes and don\u2019t forget that at the ECB press conference of 2nd&#xa0;August 2012 (just after Spanish 2 years hit 7% and he gave his \u2018Whatever it takes\u2019 speech) he said that \u2018\u2026the Governing Council may undertake may consider undertaking further non-standard monetary policy measures\u2026\u2019 and then in the Q and A section discussing what became the OMT he said that \u2018Regarding sterilisation, you should not assume that we are not going to sterilise or that we will sterilise \u2013 you have to understand these operations&#xa0;<em>(the setting up of the OMT)</em>&#xa0;are complex and they affect markets in a variety of ways. So the relevant committees will have to work and tell us exactly what is right and what is not, so it is too early to say whether they are going to be sterilised or not sterilised\u2026\u2019</p> <p>So even though it didn\u2019t happen then, QE was on the agenda, which makes me think it could well be on the agenda again if the ECB believes that deflation could be about to take hold.</p> </blockquote> <p>And if that isn't enough...there's even more reaction <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2013/11/07/1689602/ecb-rate-cut-the-analyst-reaction/\"><strong>on FT Alphaville</strong></a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FTAlphaville/statuses/398504766420287488\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ECB rate cut: the analyst reaction <a href=\"http://t.co/aAShhPd16n\">http://t.co/aAShhPd16n</a></p>&mdash; FT Alphaville (@FTAlphaville) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTAlphaville/statuses/398504766420287488\">November 7, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-527bcce6e4b0541f62c72c16\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T17:25:11.037Z\">5.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another photo from Greece tonight:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MakisSinodinos/statuses/398498975851876352\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>\u0391\u03c1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b5\u03be\u03c9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ert&amp;src=hash\">#ert</a>. \u0391\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf 18:30 \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 <a href=\"http://t.co/k2ndRlB1nD\">pic.twitter.com/k2ndRlB1nD</a></p>&mdash; Makis Sinodinos (@MakisSinodinos) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MakisSinodinos/statuses/398498975851876352\">November 7, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-527bc9d6e4b055987af67501\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T17:19:23.720Z\">5.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-54073e59-f394-46d8-b2ee-1f19102c6e55\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/7/1383844735005/e6b2489a-7e9e-4716-8d52-aa3cc6e1013c-460x297.jpeg\" alt=\"A man walks by the New York Stock Exchange in New York, New York, USA 07 November 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"297\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The New York Stock Exchange.

The rate on the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%.</p> <p>These decisions are in line with our forward guidance of July 2013, given the latest indications of further diminishing underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term, starting from currently low annual inflation rates of below 1%.</p> <p>In keeping with this picture, monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. At the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Such a constellation suggests that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on.</p> <p>Accordingly, our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary.

The ECB\u2019s mandate is for a Eurozone consumer price inflation rate of \u201cclose to but just below 2.0%\u201d, and at just 0.7% in October the inflation rate is no longer at a level that can be seen as consistent with the ECB;s target rate.</p> <p>&#xa0;Furthermore, the ECB\u2019s forward guidance that has been in place since July stated that&#xa0;\u201cthe Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.\u201d&#xa0;If the ECB had not reacted to Eurozone consumer price inflation dropping to just 0.7% in October by cutting interest rates, it could have led the markets to questioning how meaningful the ECB\u2019s forward guidance was.</p> <p>&#xa0;While the drop in Eurozone consumer price inflation to just 0.7 in October was obviously the trigger for the ECB\u2019s interest rate cut, the strength of the euro and only gradual Eurozone economic recovery from extended recession also supported the case for lower interest rates.</p> <p>&#xa0;The fact that the ECB chose to act now rather than wait until December when the Governing Council will have the ECB staff\u2019s new Eurozone GDP and consumer price inflation forecasts suggests that the bank felt there was a compelling case for prompt action.</p> <p>The fact that the ECB chose to leave its deposit rate unchanged at 0.0% despite bringing the refinancing rate down from 0.50% to 0.25% reinforces our belief that the ECB is reluctant to go down the negative deposit rate route. However, this could still happen if there is not a marked pick up in bank lending to companies and the ECB struggles to develop recovery.</p> <p>While it seems unlikely that an interest rate cut to 0.25% would have a major impact in boosting Eurozone growth, it may at least help keep the euro at a more competitive level and limit market interest rates.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCGavinHewitt/statuses/398434071225073664\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ECB has taken plunge and lowered interest rate to 0.25%.

The tone of the conference is likely to be dovish with Draghi justifying the move which has knocked the euro currency sharply lower against rivals.</p> <p>A big question for the market is how effective is this rate cut really? Conditions in the euro zone are likely to see a meaningful change after this rate cut \u2013 it seems more of a demonstration by the ECB to move away from liquidity pumping measures to measures which will ensure sustainable growth feeding into the real economy. The move therefore could be more symbolic of the ECB\u2019s evolving strategy to stimulate the euro zone economy.

Let's start with the fall in CPI [<em>consumer prices index</em>] and the apparent risk of deflation: first of all the fall in CPI is primarily a confluence of falling food prices, primarily predicated by a reversal of the long winter and flood related rise earlier in the year (check out CPI for Bavaria, which was among the worst hit by the floods) and Energy prices, dictated in part by the EUR and in part by shifting demand dynamics, it could therefore easily be argued to be transient.</p> <p>For those pointing to the low level of core CPI, it should be noted that one of the larger components in the Services CPI sub-index that has been weighing down on core CPI is Air Travel, which is heavily influenced by energy prices.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <h2>Jane Foley of Rabobank:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>EUR/USD pushed higher yesterday afternoon as \u2018sources\u2019 reported that the ECB would avoid cutting interest rates today even amid the dip in inflation. The decision, of course, was not made yesterday and will be debated by committee during the course of this morning.&#xa0;</p> <p>That said we do not expect that the ECB will announce a cut in rates today. In our view inflation is close to its trough and we would expect the ECB to wait for next week\u2019s GDP data and the fresh staff projections due in December before considering such a step. We do, however, anticipate that President Draghi is likely to emphasis the dovish tone of the ECB by \u2018disclosing\u2019 that a cut was weighed up. After all, the market is expecting a dovish tone from the ECB, so if this is not forthcoming there would be an increased chance that EUR/USD would be chased higher and this could increase the disinflationary pressure that the ECB will want to avoid.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Jonathan Pryor, Investec Corporate Treasury:</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All eyes will be focused on whether the ECB will cut the refinancing rate to a record low of 0.25%.</p> <p>Although this is not the consensus view there are still many analysts who see a rate cut as being a distinct possibility. With Eurozone inflation having fallen to 0.7% in Oct, unemployment at record highs and the strong exchange rate a concern, there is an argument for Mr Draghi to ease the pressure, with the supply of credit to the periphery still anaemic.</p> <p>His main dilemma remains whether a rate cut will make any real difference with bank to bank lending rates already near zero. Even if rates were to be kept on hold, there is still a strong chance that markets will remain volatile as the accompanying ECB press conference will be scrutinized for further clues on how the ECB are thinking with regards interest rate or other accommodative policy measures.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you'd like even more, check out <a href=\"http://t.co/AROCXCusFh\"><strong>this post on the Wall Street Journal:</strong></a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T10:30:00.901Z\">at 10.30am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-527b65b7e4b0f1cce82090a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T10:04:46.040Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/statuses/398386332969340928\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Latest CitiFX Poll shows that 15.6% believe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ECB&amp;src=hash\">#ECB</a> will cut today, while a very honest 42.8% admit to not having a clue <a href=\"http://t.co/0fY85DWVq9\">pic.twitter.com/0fY85DWVq9</a></p>&mdash; Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/statuses/398386332969340928\">November 7, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-527b61a0e4b0e869ab0fb87b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-07T10:01:37.388Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spanish industrial production turns positive</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>There are new signs of recovery in Spain for the European Central Bank to ponder at today's meeting.</strong></p> <p>Seasonally-adjusted Spanish&#xa0;industrial output rose in September for the first time in 30 months, bolstering hopes that it is pulling out of recession.</p> <p>Calendar-adjusted output rose by 1.4% year-on-year in September, much better than the 2.1% contraction reported in August.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ine.es/en/daco/daco42/daco422/ipi0913_en.pdf\"><strong>Spain's statistics body reported</strong></a> that production of capital goods (expensive machinery and the like) was&#xa0;8.4% higher than a year ago.</p> <p>Nicolas Lopez, analyst at Madrid broker M&amp;G Valores, said the data was encouraging:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All the indicators point to a turnaround, and that we're entering in to growth.

      "bodyText": "And that's a good moment to stop for the night. Thanks all. GW Analysts have been digesting the ECB's surprise interest rate cut, and Mario Draghi's press conference performance (highlights start here....with a summary here) Here's a selection. Jessica Hinds of Capital Economics: Thursday\u2019s rate cut reinforces the divergent stances of monetary policy in the euro-zone and the US. The ECB has just eased policy even further, while the Fed, for all its procrastinating, is still more than likely to scale back its asset purchases before too long. Furthermore, President Draghi added that rates could go even lower and that the ECB was \u201ctechnically ready\u201d to cut its deposit rate into negative territory. Meanwhile, we do not expect the strength of peripheral euro-zone government bonds to last just because the ECB has become more accommodative. A small cut to the refi rate will not transform the economic outlook and will not address the deep-seated problems of the peripheral countries such as their high debt burdens. Indeed, credit spreads on euro-zone peripheral government bonds have fallen all the way back to the sort of levels seen on comparably-rated assets outside the euro-zone. There would therefore appear to be a significant risk of a renewed rise in them over time if and when investors\u2019 concerns about these problems reappear. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities 1) One has to always doff one's hat to Draghi for his ability to \"blag a blagger\", in rather stark (sic) contrast to his predecessors, and the conservative Bundesbank type grouping on the council. 2) The timing for a rate cut is/was always key, and so the decision to \"go now\" rather than roll out the red carpet for December made good sense.... but that unfortunately is where the compliments stop. 3) So to the rationale: the ECB is now expecting a \"sustained period of low inflation\", but sees \"no risk of deflation\" - really? a) Does the ECB has any control over such a fine dividing line, given that Eurozone CPI is 0.7% y/y? b) One might even ask whether the ECB is wondering into the BoE's bad forecasting territory? and c) What happened to that recent suggestion that a very low level of inflation was in fact good for (hard pressed) Eurozone (above all Club Med) consumers? 4) While he could say nothing else other than that he \"believes rate cut is effective\" to then follow it up with \"some would say reduction in excess liquidity is due to less fragmentation\" and, that the rate cut \"reduces fragmentation in the periphery\" is pushing on a gossamer thin bit of string, the more so when he continued later with this particular bit of bravado: \"fundamentals in the Eurozone are probably strongest in the world\", while saying that the recovery is \"proceeding, but is weak and fragile\". Which epithet of these would be best to deploy: a) paradox, b) oxymoron or c) bipolar? 5) What will this do for growth in the Eurozone economy, employment, indeed bank lending - not a lot. The fact is that by cutting the income of savers, and in fact discouraging bank lending by keeping long-term rates at very depressed levels, as well as tying to persuade businesses and consumers that they actually do not need act now to \"lock in\" super low rates, the ECB, Fed and BoE may in fact be depressing the economy, while exponentially fuelling asset bubbles and widening economic and social gaps. Mike Ingram of BGC Partners: Cut and Run at the ECB What a shocker. The market had assumed, at most, a one in ten chance of the European Central Bank (ECB) cutting rates today and yet they did just that. The ECB refinancing rate was halved to 0.25%. For today at least, European stock and bonds were euphoric and the overly strong Euro has taken a beating. Mission accomplished Mr Draghi. In actuality, a rate cut has only been a question of \u2018when\u2019 rather than \u2018if\u2019 for some time now. Euro zone inflation is collapsing while output gaps are large and with feeble growth, set to be persistent. Moreover credit conditions are still tightening, albeit at a slower pace and little progress has been made in bringing down lending rates in Europe\u2019s beleaguered periphery. To top it all, the Euro has been strong \u2013 defying the consensus call of a strong dollar. Taken together, I wasn\u2019t kidding when I recently suggested that large swathes of the Euro zone are becoming eerily reminiscent of 1990\u2019s Japan. And yet most of us have been wrong-footed today. (I included, I thought the Bank would wait for more data before cutting in December). In defence I can only say that even as the economic case for a rate cut became compelling, Team Draghi seem infuriatingly relaxed about the need to ease policy further. Now they have belatedly leapt into action. So for many reasons, I approached the recently concluded ECB press conference with more than a little curiosity. And while it was another polished performance from Super Mario, I wasn\u2019t greatly comforted by what I heard either. I am now left feeling that while the ECB may no longer be horribly behind the curve, there is little chance they are ahead of it and it is only a matter of time before they are playing catch up again. It could have been worse of course; a late cut is better than none at all. One on the big positives was that, despite cutting rates to an all-time low, we learned that the ECB \u2018continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time\u2019. It could easily have signalled that rates at 0.25% were an effective floor, but it didn\u2019t. Moreover, it emerged in the Q&amp;A that such forward guidance was unanimous. The ECB feels it still has a few rate cards left to play. But this seemingly definitive statement of central bank activism sits uneasily with much else that the ECB had to say this afternoon. For instance, the Euro zone inflation outlook was once again described as \u2018broadly balanced\u2019. It clearly hasn\u2019t been in the past and given significant deflationary headwinds, I suspect this remains a mistaken prognosis. Of more practical concern to most of us is that the ECB\u2019s take on the nascent Euro zone economic recovery also seems threadbare. Having shifted the supposed growth drivers from exports and investment early in the year, to consumption and investment in the summer (as emerging markets swooned and PMIs picked up), it is now apparently all down to consumption. Presumably this belatedly recognises that businesses in the Euro zone remain loathe to invest. Hardly a surprise given ample spare capacity and in many cases continued credit rationing. They are more likely to bolster profits by squeezing employees. If so, sayonara consumption too! Perhaps the most disturbing part of the ECB\u2019s performance today however, was a seemingly off the cuff remark that Mario Draghi made on the long-term outlook for the Euro zone economy. The Euro zone, he said, \u2018had some of the best fundamentals in the world\u2019. (I actually laughed out loud at that point). Mario then proceeded to reel off this secret recipe for economic success: low budget deficits and current account surpluses. I\u2019m sure Angela Merkel must have been overjoyed, but it strikes me that if the main thrust of economic policy is that the rest of Europe deflates against an already competitive Germany, then the outlook for Europe is grim indeed. At that point the ECB\u2019s hand may be looking quite poor \u2013 if the market doesn\u2019t call their bluff first. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research So after spending a good part of the last 18 months stating that Europe would be experiencing uplift in economic fortunes right about now Mr Draghi has had to cut rates today. I found it an unconvincing and contradictory performance in the press conference and found it especially interesting that Mr Draghi basically ignored two questions on QE. The big question is what can the ECB do next if the worrying recent trends with regard to loan demand and inflation do not reverse. Mr Draghi stated that he had a whole range of instruments left to deal with any deteriorating situation, but the ones he mentioned were very much interest rate options. Cheap money has not yet produced any uptick in loan demand in Europe and it is difficult to see why this should change whether he alters the benchmark rate, the deposit rate or whatever. Banks continue to be in deleveraging mode and companies are not confident enough of the immediate economic outlook to invest. Thus if the ECB rate cuts do not stimulate loan growth or reverse falling prices then what do they do next? I think the first port of call would be to try and encourage banks to lend by offering a much longer term LTRO. Something in the region of a 7 or 10 year. After that comes QE. Yes I know there are potential legal challenges to such a move but I do believe Mr Draghi when he says he will do whatever it takes and don\u2019t forget that at the ECB press conference of 2nd August 2012 (just after Spanish 2 years hit 7% and he gave his \u2018Whatever it takes\u2019 speech) he said that \u2018\u2026the Governing Council may undertake may consider undertaking further non-standard monetary policy measures\u2026\u2019 and then in the Q and A section discussing what became the OMT he said that \u2018Regarding sterilisation, you should not assume that we are not going to sterilise or that we will sterilise \u2013 you have to understand these operations (the setting up of the OMT) are complex and they affect markets in a variety of ways. So the relevant committees will have to work and tell us exactly what is right and what is not, so it is too early to say whether they are going to be sterilised or not sterilised\u2026\u2019 So even though it didn\u2019t happen then, QE was on the agenda, which makes me think it could well be on the agenda again if the ECB believes that deflation could be about to take hold. And if that isn't enough...there's even more reaction on FT Alphaville: Another photo from Greece tonight: On Twitter's stock market debut, our Wall Street correspondent Dominic Rushe writes: Twitter made a spectacular debut on the New York stock exchange Thursday as its share price soared, initially valuing the company at over $31bn. The company set a share price of $26 on Tuesday but fierce bidding for the limited number of shares available drove that price up to $45.10 as the stock market opened, a rise of 73%. In early trading, the price increased even further. At $31bn, Twitter \u2013 a loss-making firm \u2013 is 10 times more valuable than the original internet darling AOL. The price is equivalent to that of Yum Brands, owner of Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut, which manages or owns 39,000 restaurants worldwide and made a profit of over $1.3bn last year. Twitter share price opens at $45.10 as value surges on Wall Street debut Significant developments in Greece tonight -- the opposition Syriza party has submitted a censure motion over the police raid on ERT's headquarters (as covered way back at 8am). According to reports from Athens, a vote of confidence could be held on Sunday night. Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras laid into prime minister Antonis Samaras over the affair. The Kathimerini newspaper reports: Speaking in Parliament, Tsipras said the government had \"no popular mandate\" for its policies. Administrative Reform Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who is overseeing a civil service overhaul, accepted Tsipras' motion, saying it would give the government an opportunity to prove that its parliamentary majority is strong. The New Democracy-PASOK coalition has 155 deputies in the 300-seat House. So it would take a rebellion from several NS and Pasok MPs for the government to lose the vote..... While the ECB press conference was taking place, protesters were holding a rally in Athens. Hundreds of people demonstrated against the decision to sent riot police into the headquarters of the former Greek Public Broadcaster (ERT). Here's some photos: Back to the eurozone, and the International Monetary Fund has joined the ranks of those welcoming today's ECB rate cut. IMF spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters that: The decision is fully warranted by the weak inflation dynamics and substantial slack in the economy. Over in New York, Twitter is finally trading -- with an almighty pop. Shares were sold at $26 each, and opened at $45.10 -- a stonking increase of over 70%. My US colleague Adam Gabbatt is tracking all the action here: Twitter IPO -\u2013 live coverage A quick summary of the key points from the ECB press conference (highlights start here) \u2022 The European Central Bank has suggested that euro interest rates could be cut still further, after slashing borrowing costs to a new record low of 0.25%. The governing council reiterated its forward guidance that borrowing costs will remain at their present or lower levels for an 'extended period of time', and pledged that \"our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary.\" \u2022 ECB president Mario Draghi warned that the eurozone faces a prolonged period of low inflation. He denied, though, that there is a real risk of deflation gripping the area. \u2022 The decision was not fully unanimous, Draghi revealed, with some members of the committee arguing to wait until December. \u2022 Draghi also rejected suggestions that the euro area is sinking into Japanification. Instead, it has the best fundamentals in the world, he claimed. Not everyone is convinced..... \u2022 The rate cut has already been welcomed by the Italian prime minister and the French finance minister. \u2022 The euro remains weaker today, down over 1% against the US dollar at $1.3374 and 0.7% lower against sterling. Stock markets welcomed the cut, with European shares hitting new five-year highs. France's finance minister says it is \"good news\" that eurozone interest rates have been cut to a new record low. Pierre Moscovici tweeted that the rate cut was welcome support for the ongoing recovery in the eurozone, and should lower the risk of deflation. Haven't seen any reaction from Germany yet.... That's the end of the ECB press conference. And better late than never, here's a link to Mario Draghi's opening statement explaining why the ECB cut rates: Introductory statement to the press conference. First, based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to lower the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by 25 basis points to 0.25% and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 25 basis points to 0.75%. The rate on the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%. These decisions are in line with our forward guidance of July 2013, given the latest indications of further diminishing underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term, starting from currently low annual inflation rates of below 1%. In keeping with this picture, monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. At the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Such a constellation suggests that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. Accordingly, our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary. It will thereby also continue to assist the gradual economic recovery as reflected in confidence indicators up to October. Mario Draghi's declaration that the eurozone has the best economic fundamentals in the world may come back to haunt him, ECB-watchers suggest: In other news, a team from Twitter including actor Sir Patrick Stewart just rang the opening bell on Wall Street. Full coverage here: Twitter IPO: live coverage Is the deflation threat in the eurozone similar to Japan? No, replies Mario Draghi. I don't think so. He reminds the press conference that the eurozone crisis started with the region's banks being overleveraged, with many bad assets. In some countries, both deficits and debts needed to come down. Thus the need for fiscal consolidation. He then declares the eurozone's fundamentals are \"probably the strongest in the world\". This is a zone that has the lowest budget deficit in the world..... It has the highest current account surplus. And it has one of the lowest inflation rates. This does not translate into a \"galloping recovery\" but it creates a platform to build a recovery on, he insists. Take that, eurozone doubters. Was the euro's strength against the US dollar a factor in today's decision? Draghi denies that the issue was even discussed. Exchange rates are not a policy target, he insists. He adde that the rate cut will reduce fragmentation across the eurozone (ie, the fact that borrowing costs in parts of the euro area are higher than others). Progress on fragmentation appears to have stalled recently, he adds. Today's cut will help healthy banks in the periphery to get better access to funds, he adds. Back to the ECB press conference, Mario Draghi is asked about the prospect of Ireland leaving its bailout programme without a precautionary credit line (a safety net for its return to the financial markets) He replies that Ireland should be congratulated for completing its financial aid programme (as reported before noon in the blog, it has passed its final Troika inspection today). The decision on whether to take a precautionary credit line is entirely up to Dublin's government, he adds. The ECB won't interfere. Italian prime minister Enrico Letta has declared that the eurozone interest rate cut is \"great news\" and shows that the ECB understands the need for growth (via Reuters) A question about whether the financial markets were unprepared for today's announcement. And has Draghi produced an anti-tank weapon, rather than the pea-shooter that Kit Juckes mentioned this morning. Mario Draghi declines to comment on the market reaction, as they \"do what they want\" . He also declares that the credibility of the ECB's forward guidance has been \"strengthened\" by today's decision, urging economists to take another look at last month's statement. Draghi explains that it's important to have low real interest rates to help the fragile recovery. It is also much harder to make much-needed reforms and get monetary measures to work if inflation is significantly below 2%. Quite a complicated answer on the issue of liquidity in the euro area.... Will a rate cut really do any good? Draghi says he believes the rate cut will be effective, and there are signs of it already being effective (the drop in the value of the euro?) It will help lending to businesses and households, and push down real interest rates, he pledges. Was the decision unanimous? Apparently not! Draghi says the governing council was \"Wholly in agreement about the need to act, but there were disagreements about when to act\". A majority pushed for action today, while others wanted to wait for next month's data for additional information. On the forward guidance, there was unanimity, he adds. Was Jens Weidmann of the Bundesbank one of those who wanted to wait, we wonder... Reuters asks whether the ECB considered cutting its deposit lending rate into negative territory (meaning banks would have to pay to leave money in its electronic vaults). Draghi says that the governing council certainly discussed it, and stands ready to act if needed. We want to have some instruments in our artillery, and that is certainty one, he adds. A new long-term LTRO* was not discussed in any detail, though. * - a long-term offering of cheap loans First question goes to Bloomberg -- How long will this prolonged period of low inflation be, and will it fall lower, closer towards deflation? And what tools does the ECB have to fight deflation? Draghi says inflation will be low for some period of time....\"it certainly won't be a short period of time\" (so not much clarity there!). We'll get more details at the next ECB forecasts in December, he promises. The ECB does not see a \"self fulfilling decline in prices across goods and countries\", though, he adds. Onto the Q&amp;A.... Governments must implement structural reforms in labour markets too, Draghi says -- to help push down jobless levels and improve competitiveness. Draghi concludes his statement with his regular warning that eurozone governments should not ease the pace of reforms. Draghi makes some interesting points on the state of the eurozone banking sector. Loan dynamics remain weak, reflecting the state of the business cycle. It is essential that banks are strengthened, and fragmentation across banking sector is reduced, says Draghi. He adds that the ECB's new stress tests of eurozone banks should help to rebuild confidence in the sector.... Following today's rate cuts, the risks to eurozone inflation are 'broadly balanced' says Draghi, as he reiterates that inflation may remain low for a prolonged period of time. Draghi is explaining that while the eurozone economy is finally growing again after 18 months of recession, it remains weak and vulnerable. He cited several threats -- global money market conditions, higher commodity prices, weak domestic demand, disappointing exports, and insufficient progress on economic reforms by eurozone governments. The full statement will be online soon. Draghi reiterates that eurozone borrowing costs will remain at their present or lower levels until conditions improve -- suggesting a further cut below 0.25% is still possible. Monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary, basically. He also states that the ECB stands ready to continue all available instruments. The ECB will continue to conduct its three-month LTROS (lending to eurozone banks) until at least the end of the second quarter of 2015. The eurozone may experience \"a prolonged period of low inflation\", Draghi warns, followed by a gradual return back to the target of close to, but below 2%. Monetary and credit dynamics remain subdued, says Draghi, while inflation expectations are firmly anchored. Mario Draghi's press conference is underway, with the ECB president saying the ECB governing council took a number of decisions at today's meeting. He confirms that interest rates have been cut, saying it is 'in line' with the ECB's forward guidance on interest rate policy. Newsflash: US GDP rose by 2.8% on an annualised basis in the third quarter of 2013 - higher than expected. Mario Draghi is about to sitting down to meet the press in Frankfurt, and explain why the ECB cut interest rates. The press conference will be streamed live here, and on Bloomberg TV. Here's our news story on the ECB rate cut, by Heather Stewart: Borrowers across the struggling eurozone economies received an unexpected fillip on Thursday when the European Central Bank cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, in a bid to stave off a slide into deflation. After its monthly policy meeting in Frankfurt, the ECB's governing council announced that it would reduce its key refinancing rate to 0.25%, from 0.5%. More here: ECB surprises markets by cutting eurozone interest rates to 0.25% More reaction to the ECB rate cut. Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics: (via Reuters) The ECB\u2019s decision to cut interest rates is a pleasant surprise given the Governing Council\u2019s previous insensitivity to the growing risks of deflation in the region \u2013 some members felt just last month that the case for a rate cut was not even worth discussing! The press conference ... may offer the prospect of more policy action, perhaps including more LTROs. But the ECB alone cannot address the deep-seated problems still facing the single currency union. Neil Williams, chief economist at Hermes Fund Managers: Draghi\u2019s pledge last year to \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d may continue to cap funding costs (a symptom), but will do little to address the underlying problem: disparate competitiveness across a monetary union with insufficient economic union. We doubt any sudden volte-face from Germany on fiscal/banking union. We are more concerned about Spain\u2019s dilemma: where fiscal inertia means funding strains; yet, approaching 60% male youth unemployment, any meaningful reform risks social unrest. Here's a round-up of instant reaction to the ECB interest rate cut: Carsten Brzeski of ING: Deflationary risks and the stronger euro seem to have motivated the ECB\u2019s move. It is obvious that the ECB under president Draghi has become much more pro-active than under any of his predecessors. Let\u2019s now wait for the press conference to see whether Draghi has more surprises to offer. David Nicholls, alliance manager at UKForex, said: It is a bold move, and further demonstrates the ECB\u2019s resolve to use any means necessary to get growth back into Europe and ensure any existing momentum does not wane from the fragile Eurozone recovery. Although some commentators were foreseeing this move it has caught the market off guard with GBP/EUR moving up over 1.2 and EUR/USD crashing 2 cents to 1.3370. The euro\u2019s status as a safe haven bet against the dollar is rapidly being lost. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: The ECB\u2019s decision to cut its key interest from 0.50% to 0.25% is obviously the consequence of uncomfortably low and falling Eurozone consumer price inflation. The ECB\u2019s mandate is for a Eurozone consumer price inflation rate of \u201cclose to but just below 2.0%\u201d, and at just 0.7% in October the inflation rate is no longer at a level that can be seen as consistent with the ECB;s target rate. Furthermore, the ECB\u2019s forward guidance that has been in place since July stated that \u201cthe Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.\u201d If the ECB had not reacted to Eurozone consumer price inflation dropping to just 0.7% in October by cutting interest rates, it could have led the markets to questioning how meaningful the ECB\u2019s forward guidance was. While the drop in Eurozone consumer price inflation to just 0.7 in October was obviously the trigger for the ECB\u2019s interest rate cut, the strength of the euro and only gradual Eurozone economic recovery from extended recession also supported the case for lower interest rates. The fact that the ECB chose to act now rather than wait until December when the Governing Council will have the ECB staff\u2019s new Eurozone GDP and consumer price inflation forecasts suggests that the bank felt there was a compelling case for prompt action. The fact that the ECB chose to leave its deposit rate unchanged at 0.0% despite bringing the refinancing rate down from 0.50% to 0.25% reinforces our belief that the ECB is reluctant to go down the negative deposit rate route. However, this could still happen if there is not a marked pick up in bank lending to companies and the ECB struggles to develop recovery. While it seems unlikely that an interest rate cut to 0.25% would have a major impact in boosting Eurozone growth, it may at least help keep the euro at a more competitive level and limit market interest rates. Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital: ECB chief Mario Draghi today showed he is quite different from former ECB head Trichet, pulling out a surprise like this from time to time. High unemployment in the region also another likely contributor to today\u2019s rate cut \u2013 markets are now eyeing Draghi\u2019s press conference for further insight into the decision. The tone of the conference is likely to be dovish with Draghi justifying the move which has knocked the euro currency sharply lower against rivals. A big question for the market is how effective is this rate cut really? Conditions in the euro zone are likely to see a meaningful change after this rate cut \u2013 it seems more of a demonstration by the ECB to move away from liquidity pumping measures to measures which will ensure sustainable growth feeding into the real economy. The move therefore could be more symbolic of the ECB\u2019s evolving strategy to stimulate the euro zone economy. Earlier, the BOE kept policies unchanged, as expected \u2013 muted response in markets. Eyes are now firmly on Draghi for more So why did the European Central Bank cut interest rates to a new record low of just 0.25%? The eurozone's central bank acted after inflation slumped to just 0.7% in October, well below its target of just under 2%. This morning's news of deflation in Ireland may have encouraged it to act. Private sector firms have also reported that activity grew at a slower rate in October than September, suggesting the recovery from recession was faltering. With unemployment at a record high of 12.2%, and many countries suffering from the impact of austerity, the ECB's governing council has concluded that monetary policy should be eased. Some dovish members of the council have been pushing for a rate cut at earlier meetings, but hawks refused to back them. We don't know, yet, whether the decision was unanimous. ECB president Mario Draghi should give some hints at the press conference in 25 minutes time.... Europe's stock markets, which were down before the ECB cut interest rates, are also rallying -- the FTSE 100 is up 30 points at 6772. The Spanish IBEX is the biggest gainer, up 1.2% today to 9964. The euro has tumbled by over 1% against the US dollar on the news of today's ECB rate cut. It has hit a seven week low of $1.3375 against the dollar, down one and half cents. It's also down against sterling, pushing the pound up to \u20ac1.20. Here's the full statement from the ECB, confirming that it has cut the headline borrowing rate across the eurozone to 0.25%. It also lowered the rate it charges eurozone banks by a quarter-point. At today\u2019s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions: The interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be decreased by 25 basis points to 0.25%, starting from the operation to be settled on 13 November 2013. The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be decreased by 25 basis points to 0.75%, with effect from 13 November 2013. The interest rate on the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 2.30 p.m. CET today. Get your popcorn ready.... THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK HAS CUT INTEREST RATES. In a surprise move, the ECB has lowered the main refinancing rate from 0.5% to 0.25%, responding to signs of falling inflation rates and record unemployment across the eurozone. Lots more to follow, including Mario Draghi's press conference in 40 minutes.... One central bank down, one to go. The European Central Bank publishes its own decision on monetary policy at 12.45pm GMT, followed by the hour-long press conference from 1.30pm GMT. As flagged up earlier, the ECB is expected to leave borrowing costs unchanged. Unlike the Bank of England, the ECB will set three interest rates. They are: The main financing rate: currently 0.5%. The headline interest rate across the eurozone The marginal lending facility rate: currently 1%. Charged by the ECB when banks borrow from it The deposit facility rate: currently 0.0%. Paid on the deposits which eurozone banks leave at the ECB overnight And here's Melanie Bowler, economist at Moody's Analytics, on the Bank of England's decision to leave interest rates unchanged: The Bank of England made no change at the penultimate monetary policy meeting of the year. Despite the strengthening economy and lingering inflationary pressures, policy will remain expansionary for some time, with interest rates not expected to rise before the unemployment rate falls to 7%. Britain\u2019s central bankers are holding policy expansionary in a bid to ensure the recovery translates into sustained economic growth. GDP has accelerated through the first nine months of 2013\u2014preliminary third quarter data report a 0.8% q/q expansion\u2014and is expected to remain on a solid growth trajectory. Central bankers will have at hand during today\u2019s meeting the bank's latest economic forecasts, which will be publicly available next week. We expect an upward revision to the GDP forecast. Earlier this week, the European Commission sharply revised up its GDP growth estimate for the U.K. in 2014 to 2.2% from its spring forecast of 1.7%. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), argues that the Bank of England needs to update its forward guidance, and admit next week that interest rates will probably rise before 2016: The decision to hold interest rates and QE was expected and correct. However, as the pace of economic growth strengthens, it is becoming clear that the first rise in official interest rates is likely to occur well before the Committee\u2019s 2016 prediction, due to the earlier than anticipated fall in unemployment. The MPC must use next week\u2019s Inflation Report to move towards a more realistic timetable for its forward guidance, to maintain business confidence and keep its credibility. The Committee must continue to combine forward guidance with a firm commitment to bringing down inflation. Additional QE must not be contemplated in current circumstances. The MPC must also place more emphasis on measures that will improve the flow of finance to SMEs and growing businesses. This means replacing some of the gilts in the Bank of England's balance sheet with private sector assets such as securitized SME loans. No surprise in the City that the Bank of England left interest rates unchanged today. The pound is all-but flat at $1.607, and the FTSE 100 is down a mere 5 points at 6736. JUST IN: The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged, at their record low of 0.5%. The monetary policy committee also decided to make no changes to its quantitative easing stimulus package - under which it holds \u00a3375bn of UK government debt. And there's no statement either. Twitter's logo is proudly on display on Wall Street, ahead of its flotation on the New York stock exchange today: Ireland's finance ministry has just announced that it has successfully completed its lenders' final review of the \u20ac85bn bailout, and hit all the troika's targets. Finance Minister Michael Noonan just told reporters in Ireland that: This is a significant day that many thought, and some feared, would never be reached. Reuters has more details: \u2022 11:48 - IRISH FINANCE MINISTRY SAYS IRELAND HAS CONTINUED TO ACHIEVE ALL OF THE TARGETS SET UNDER OUR PROGRAMME OF ASSISTANCE \u2022 11:49 - IRISH FINANCE MINISTRY SAYS WILL MAKE DECISION ON PRECAUTIONARY CREDIT LINE BEFORE DEC 15 \u2022 11:49 - IRISH FINANCE MINISTRY SAYS ISSUE OF WHETHER TO TAKE PRECAUTIONARY CREDIT LINE IS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION Speaking of Ireland, the Republic should take another step towards leaving its bailout today. Reuters explains: The European Union and International Monetary Fund are due to sign off later on Thursday on the last part of a \u20ac85bn ($114 billion) bailout, leaving Ireland to exit the process by the end of the year, the first crisis-hit euro zone country to do so. Debts resulting from a rescue of its crashing bank sector in 2008 helped force Ireland into seeking aid from its EU partners and the European Union two years later as the euro zone's debt crisis deepened. The official \"troika\" of lenders - the European Commission, European Central Bank and IMF - are conducting their final review of the bailout and given Ireland has met every major target, are widely expected to release the final funds. They are expected to release statements after about 1200 GMT. So, shortly after the Bank of England announces its decision on interest rates and quantitative easing. Crumbs. Consumer prices in Ireland fell last month, reinforcing the message that inflation in parts of the eurozone is in retreat. The Irish Consumer Prices Index (CPI) showed that the cost of living fell by 0.2% in October compared with September. On an annual basis, prices were just 0.1% higher. The Harmonised CPI reading shows actual deflation on an annual basis too -- it fell by 0.1% compared with October 2012, and was 0.2% lower compared to September 2013. Something else for the ECB's governing council to ponder in Frankfurt - German industrial production fell by 0.9% in September. That's rather worse than the 0.2% decline which analysts expected, and is a surprise given the strong factory order data for the month released yesterday. However, August's reading has been revised higher to a 1.6% increase. And the German finance ministry isn't fretting, saying the trend is still upwards. Halfords shares are racing ahead this morning, up almost 13% after it reported a 6.4% rise in earnings. The car parts to cycles chain is profiting from the UK's love affair with the pedal, as Toby Morris, Senior Sales Trader at CMC explains: A second successive British victory in the Tour de France and a scorching summer has seen record interest in two wheel transport, and subsequent bumper profits are well timed for Halfords, who are in the early stages of a large scale investment to ramp up flagging sales. The City remains subdued this morning as we wait for the decisions of the ECB (12.45pm) and the Bank of England (noon GMT): David Madden, market analyst at IG, explains: The FTSE 100 is down 15 points mid-morning, as traders square their positions ahead of Bank of England and European Central Bank rate decisions. Equities are a touch lower this morning, as we have a tale of two central banks. The BoE is expected to keep rates on hold and bond buying at \u00a3375bn, but we may hear some hawkish comments in its statement afterwards \u2013 the growing economy and talk of a property bubble could mean Mr Carney will raise rates sooner than anticipated. The ECB is more inclined to reduce rates, as a high jobless rate, minimal growth and a relatively strong currency are keeping the eurozone in limbo. An interest rate cut or a liquidity injection could get the region working again. Randgold Resources has surged 7% this morning, after the miner stated it is on track to ramp-up production and trim costs. The stock is down nearly 30% year-to-date but it looks like the South African miner\u2019s cost-cutting plan is coming into line with the price of gold. Schroders is a victim of its own success, as despite posting a jump in profits and an increase in assets under management, the stocks is off 4%. Still, speculative traders would do well to keep in mind that the share price has more than doubled in the past 18 months. Spain had a decent result in the bond markets this morning. Its Treasury sold \u20ac4.03bn of debt - slightly above its \u20ac3bn-\u20ac4bn target - at lower rates than a month ago. The auction included almost \u20ac2.4bn of five-year bonds, at an average yield of 2.871% - down from 3.059% at a similar sale in October. Eurozone debt has proved popular this week. Yesterday, Italy raised \u20ac22bn in a sale of four-year bonds that was aimed, in part, at small investors. That's the biggest single bond sale by a European government ever, bankers say: There are predictions galore about today's European Central Bank meeting, and what the eurozone central bank may do in the coming months. Few analysts expect a cut to the headline borrowing rate (currently 0.5%) this afternoon, although the ECB could pave the way to December action (as discussed earlier). But Draghi and chums do have several other levers to hand -- they could announce, or hint at, a new LTRO programme to flood eurozone banks with liquidity; cutting the 'refinancing rate' (which it pays to banks who lend to it) from 0.0% into negative territory is another option. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities While the overwhelming consensus is for no change in rates today, but there are many expecting a move in December, the irony is perhaps that if the ECB is seriously considering a rate cut, then it would be better to spring a surprise today, than to roll out the red carpet for a move in December. A rate cut would however be besieged by problems surrounding the rationale for a move. Let's start with the fall in CPI [consumer prices index] and the apparent risk of deflation: first of all the fall in CPI is primarily a confluence of falling food prices, primarily predicated by a reversal of the long winter and flood related rise earlier in the year (check out CPI for Bavaria, which was among the worst hit by the floods) and Energy prices, dictated in part by the EUR and in part by shifting demand dynamics, it could therefore easily be argued to be transient. For those pointing to the low level of core CPI, it should be noted that one of the larger components in the Services CPI sub-index that has been weighing down on core CPI is Air Travel, which is heavily influenced by energy prices. Jane Foley of Rabobank: EUR/USD pushed higher yesterday afternoon as \u2018sources\u2019 reported that the ECB would avoid cutting interest rates today even amid the dip in inflation. The decision, of course, was not made yesterday and will be debated by committee during the course of this morning. That said we do not expect that the ECB will announce a cut in rates today. In our view inflation is close to its trough and we would expect the ECB to wait for next week\u2019s GDP data and the fresh staff projections due in December before considering such a step. We do, however, anticipate that President Draghi is likely to emphasis the dovish tone of the ECB by \u2018disclosing\u2019 that a cut was weighed up. After all, the market is expecting a dovish tone from the ECB, so if this is not forthcoming there would be an increased chance that EUR/USD would be chased higher and this could increase the disinflationary pressure that the ECB will want to avoid. Jonathan Pryor, Investec Corporate Treasury: All eyes will be focused on whether the ECB will cut the refinancing rate to a record low of 0.25%. Although this is not the consensus view there are still many analysts who see a rate cut as being a distinct possibility. With Eurozone inflation having fallen to 0.7% in Oct, unemployment at record highs and the strong exchange rate a concern, there is an argument for Mr Draghi to ease the pressure, with the supply of credit to the periphery still anaemic. His main dilemma remains whether a rate cut will make any real difference with bank to bank lending rates already near zero. Even if rates were to be kept on hold, there is still a strong chance that markets will remain volatile as the accompanying ECB press conference will be scrutinized for further clues on how the ECB are thinking with regards interest rate or other accommodative policy measures. If you'd like even more, check out this post on the Wall Street Journal: There are new signs of recovery in Spain for the European Central Bank to ponder at today's meeting. Seasonally-adjusted Spanish industrial output rose in September for the first time in 30 months, bolstering hopes that it is pulling out of recession. Calendar-adjusted output rose by 1.4% year-on-year in September, much better than the 2.1% contraction reported in August. Spain's statistics body reported that production of capital goods (expensive machinery and the like) was 8.4% higher than a year ago. Nicolas Lopez, analyst at Madrid broker M&amp;G Valores, said the data was encouraging: All the indicators point to a turnaround, and that we're entering in to growth. The doubt remains on whether it will be strong or weak, but it's clear we're passing from a period of recession to a period of growth. This chart shows how Spanish industrial production has been hit by its long recession: Greek MPs are demanding answers over the decision to send the riot police into the offices of state broadcaster ERT this morning (via university lecturer and crisis watcher Spyros Gkelis) Credit Agricole economist Frederik Ducrozet has published a handy research note on the ECB's rate decision, due this afternoon. It includes this chart, shows how eurozone inflation rates has sagged below the target of just below 2% in recent months: Frederik doesn't expect a rate cut today, as the case is \"not compelling\", adding: Inflation and unemployment are lagging indicators. A rate cut alone will do little to weaken the EUR further. On balance, we do not expect the ECB to deliver this week, although a more explicit signal cannot be ruled out. He also explains what Draghi would have to say today to tee up an interest rate cut in December: \u2022 An explicit hint during the Q&amp;A, if Draghi is asked whether the decision was unanimous (eg, \u201cwe had an intense discussion about a possible rate cut, but in the end we decided to leave rates unchanged\u201d). \u2022 The signal can, and will likely, remain data-dependent and conditional on December staff forecasts, given that the latter are likely to be revised down anyway (in terms of inflation projections at least, even if November data improves). \u2022 An implicit hint at a likely shift in the balance of risks to price stability (eg, if current subdued core prices are seen as \u201cextending to the medium term\u201c), or a reference to FX and oil prices as downside risks to inflation. Obviously if the balance of risks is shifted to the downside as soon as this week, it's a very clear signal of an imminent rate cut. Here's the full note: ECB preview \u2013 What To Watch: Back in the UK, the banks appear to be dragging their feet over compensating victims of the interest rate swaps scandal. The banks are have set aside \u00a33bn for the various small firms who were mis-sold complex and unneeded hedging products, but have only settled 125 cases, and paid a mere \u00a315m. Britain's City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, has now written to bank bosses, urging them to speed up the process. It says it is \" frustrated\" that the compensation process is proceeding so slowly. The banks need to hurry up -- around 30,000 firms are though to have lost out after buying protection against interest rate rises. More here: UK regulator urges banks to speed up swaps mis-selling compensation More reaction to the decision to send riot police to evict people from the offices of Greece's former state broadcaster this morning, starting with journalist Nick Malkoutzis: Dialogos Radio/Media has great coverage of how the riot police-led eviction unfolded on its twitter feed. European stock markets are down slightly in early trading, as investors eye the European Central Bank's monetary policy decision this afternoon. The FTSE 100 has dipped 0.2%, or 13 points. The biggest faller is the Coca Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (which recently transferred its listing from Athens to London). Its shares are down 2% after it reported a 5% drop in net sales,with volume down in both developed markets and emerging ones The euro is pretty calm, up just 0.1% at $1.35 against the US dollar. That suggests traders aren't pricing in an ECB rate cut today.... More photos from Greece, showing the storming of state broadcaster ERT (see here for more details: The Greek government spokesman has just confirmed that the operation to evict workers occupying the premises of state-run TV \"is still underway.\" Simos Kedikoglou told Mega TV: The building has been liberated....There were several reasons why normality had to be imposed, adding that Greece's upcoming presidency of the EU in January was one reason to act. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: The building belongs to the finance ministry but it was unclear if the the finance minister Yannis Stournaras had ordered the eviction operation. The timing of the raid, when international inspectors from the EU and IMF were back in Greece to monitor the country's economic progress, was aimed as much at sending an internal message as one abroad - that the government is determined to clean up its act and press ahead with reforms, analysts said. There's shock and anger in Greece this morning after people woke up to the news that riot police had been sent into the headquarters of former state television station ERT. Tear gas was reportedly used as riot officers evicted workers from the site, where they'd been broadcasting a skeleton service over the internet since the station was suddenly shut down in June. ERT is now calling on people to come to its Athens headquarters to protest - and crowds are already gathering: Here's Reuters's early take: Scuffles broke out between some of the protesters and riot police, who had cordoned off the area and blocked the entrance to the building. Police fired small rounds of teargas to disperse some of the protesters and detained two former workers and two unionists for resisting authorities, the officials said.... \"The battle for democracy and social justice which ERT workers have been fighting for more than four months, has reached its most crucial moment,\" read a message on ERT's Facebook page calling for people to protest in solidarity. \"It's time to act, rally now! The decision to send the riot police in will surely spark a political row in Greece again, on the third day of the Troika's visit to Athens. This photo shows how an MP from the left-wing Syriza party was blocked from reaching the HQ: Amid a flurry of company announcements, supermarket chain WM Morrison stands out for the wrong reason. It reported another sales decline -- like-for-like trading (excluding fuel) is down 2.4% over the last 13 weeks. Analysts had expected a drop of 1.7%, according to Reuters. Morrison blamed competition from convenience stores and online (where it has been a real laggard), and warned that: Consumer confidence remains subdued and we continue to see heavy promotional activity across the industry. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. It's a big day for central bank news, with the Bank of England and the European Central Bank both announcing their monthly decisions on monetary policy. And I suspect the atmosphere will be quite different in London than in Frankfurt. The ECB must decide whether to cut rates, or ease monetary conditions in some other way, in response to signs that the euro economy is de-inflating as the recovery loses momentum. Few economists actually expect a cut to the headline borrowing rate at 12.45pm GMT today (although it's certainly possible), but the subsequent press conference with Mario Draghi (1.30pm GMT) will be closely watched. He may set the scene for a rate cut in December, for example. Another option would be to impose 'negative interest rates' on the eurozone banks, to encourage them to lend more. The pressure is on the ECB after core consumer price inflation unexpectedly fell last week, and unemployment hit a new record high. This prompted much concern that the eurozone is slipping into a Japan-style slump. Although there's only so much that even the president of the ECB can do to fix the euro area's troubles: At Threadneedle Street, though, the Bank of England will have the luxury of looking at an economy that appears to be on the up. Governor Mark Carney's forward guidance that interest rate probably won't rise until 2016 is looking increasingly unconvincing, with economic surveys beating forecasts and house prices climbing. The Bank of England is very unlikely to change rates, or boost its stimulus programme,at noon GMT -- but one can never rule out a surprise statement. It's also a big day for company results, both in the UK: And across Europe: While in America, we get the first reading of US GDP for the last quarter (1.30pm GMT).... and also the flotation of Twitter onto the New York stock market. Last night the microblogging network raised the price of the IPO again, to $26 per share. Spread betters suggest they'll pop rather higher when trading begins.... There's also drama in Greece, after Greek riot police stormed the building of former state television station ERT in the early hours of the morning. More on this shortly, along with all the latest developments through the day....",

He said: \"The heat is certainly on for management to deliver a material improvement in across-the-board sales growth over the important Christmas period.\" Philips said that a relaunch of own-label products and an \"uplifting\" ad campaign featuring celebrities Ant and Dec would drive positive sales growth over the next three months. Morrisons will begin an online delivery service in Warwickshire from January 2014, as it becomes the last of the major grocers to open an internet store. The service, in partnership with Ocado, will then be rolled out to Yorkshire, and by the end of 2014 more than half of the UK's households, including London, should be able to order online.

He quit his \u00a3750,000 role on 2 July 2012, just days after the bank was thrown into turmoil in the aftermath of its \u00a3290m fine for attempting to rig Libor. But he was forced into a U-turn the next day after regulators forced out Bob Diamond, the chief executive, instead. Agius stayed until the end of October when he was replaced by Sir David Walker. The bank later revealed that he had been retained on a 12-month \u00a3175,000 consultancy contract to provide what was described as advisory support for the corporate banking arm. In the annual report released in March the bank said this one-year arrangement would be reviewed \"in light of business generated\". He is now to remain with the bank until March 2014, with continued use of the bank's town house in the West End of London, intended for the bank's wealthiest clients. It is not clear how much he will be paid for the remaining five months of his consultancy. Agius was one of the best known investment bankers in the City \u2013 he spent 35 years with Lazards \u2013 when he was appointed to the board of Barclays in 2006, becoming chairman in January the following year. His wife, Kate, is the daughter of Edmund de Rothschild, of the Rothschild banking family. His tenure coincided with the 2007 credit crunch and the 2008 banking crisis, when the bank caused controversy by turning to Middle Eastern investors for a \u00a37bn life-saving cash call instead of taking a taxpayer bailout. Agius also had to tackle rebellions by shareholders over pay deals for Diamond, and the bank's pay policies. His testimony to the Treasury select committee in the days after the Libor fine caused shockwaves: he revealed that on the day he announced his resignation he had been summoned by the then governor of the Bank of England, Lord King, to be told that Diamond no longer had the support of the regulator. Many City sources believe that Agius resigned to try to protect Diamond after the bank had been caught out by the public and political reaction to the Libor fine. Since then, regulators have levied bigger fines on Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS of Switzerland and the Dutch bank Rabobank for attempting to manipulate the key benchmark interest rate, while the money broker Icap has also been fined. Other firms remain under investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority and there have been reports that EU competition authorities are preparing to fine a number of banks, including Barclays, for rigging other benchmark rates. Barclays, now run by Antony Jenkins who was promoted after Diamond left, admitted last week it is now co-operating with regulators on a new investigation into whether the \u00a33tn-a-day currency markets have been manipulated. The investigation is at an early stage, although some in the City believe that it could eventually be on the same scale as the Libor-rigging scandal.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Borrowers across the struggling eurozone economies received an unexpected fillip on Thursday when the European Central Bank cut interest rates to a fresh record low, in a bid to stave off a slide into deflation. After its monthly policy meeting in Frankfurt, the ECB's governing council announced that it would reduce its key refinancing rate to 0.25%, from 0.5%. While the economy of the 18-member single currency area clambered out of recession earlier this year, Mario Draghi, the ECB's president, warned that the outlook could deteriorate in the coming months. \"The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside,\" he said. \"Developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. Other downside risks include higher commodity prices, weaker than expected domestic demand and export growth, and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries.\" As well as the rate cut, which took financial markets by surprise, Draghi said the ECB would continue making low-cost loans to eurozone banks until at least mid-2015, to try to prevent the financial sector from seizing up. Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \"The fact that the ECB chose to act now rather than wait until December when the governing council will have the ECB staff's new eurozone GDP and consumer price inflation forecasts suggests that the bank felt there was a compelling case for prompt action.\" With inflation running well below the ECB's 2% target, at just 0.7% in October, a growing number of analysts have started to warn that deflation \u2013 which can be disastrous for economies carrying a heavy debt burden, as prices and wages fall while debt-levels remain fixed \u2013 is a real threat. Draghi suggested at his press conference that, \"we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation\". The recent strength of the euro against the dollar has also raised fears in some member-countries about the competitiveness of the zone's exports on world markets. The euro was down by more than 1% against most major currencies after Thursday's announcement, hitting a seven-week low of $1.3375 against the dollar.Italian prime minister Enrico Letta, speaking on a visit to Dublin, described the ECB's decision as \"great news\", adding that, \"it shows the ECB cares about growth and competitiveness in Europe\". The International Monetary Fund also welcomed the move. \"The decision is fully warranted by the weak inflation dynamics and substantial slack in the economy,\" said spokesman Gerry Rice. The muted strength of the economic recovery in many eurozone countries is likely to have been another factor influencing the ECB's decision: earlier this week, the European commission revised down its expectation for growth across the 18 member-countries to just 1.1% in 2014. Nevertheless, Draghi insisted at his Frankfurt press conference that the \"fundamentals\" of the eurozone are, \"probably the strongest in the world\". However, some analysts warned that the rate cut should be no substitute for the urgent reforms the eurozone needs to secure recovery and tackle the legacy of unmanageable government debts. \"It's a palliative: a legal high,\" said Danny Gabay, of City consultancy Fathom. \"They need to get on with the really important stuff: fiscal union, banking reform, debt mutualisation.\" The ECB's move is unlikely to prove popular in Germany, where the Bundesbank \u2013 whose president, Jens Weidmann, sits on the ECB's governing council \u2013 has tended to take a hawkish stance, opposing some of the ECB's recession-busting measures. Draghi admitted that Thursday's decision had not been unanimous, saying the governing council was, \"wholly in agreement about the need to act, but there were disagreements about when to act\". The suprise rate cut was the fifth since Draghi took over from the more orthodox Jean-Claude Trichet in 2011. The decision followed an earlier announcement from the Bank of England that it will leave its own interest rate unchanged at 0.5%, and the total value of assets held under QE at \u00a3375bn.",

Howard Archer, IHS Global Insight The ECB's decision to cut its key interest to 0.25% is obviously the consequence of uncomfortably low and falling eurozone consumer price inflation. The ECB's mandate is for a eurozone consumer price inflation rate of \"close to but just below 2.0%\", and at just 0.7% in October the inflation rate is no longer at a level that can be seen as consistent with the ECB's target rate. While the drop in eurozone consumer price inflation was obviously the trigger for the ECB's interest rate cut, the strength of the euro and only gradual eurozone economic recovery from recession also supported the case for lower interest rates.

The combination of October's unexpectedly large fall in consumer price inflation to just 0.7%, the strength of the euro exchange rate and growing concerns over liquidity conditions in the banking sector appears to have persuaded most members that some sort of reaction was necessary.

      "bodyText": "America's economy grew at a faster-than-expected 2.8% annual rate in the third quarter of 2013, raising the prospect that the Federal Reserve could start to phase out its recession-busting quantitative easing programme before Ben Bernanke bows out in January. Wall Street analysts had expected the world's largest economy to slow between July and September from the 2.5% pace recorded in the second quarter. But in a keenly awaited statement \u2013 delayed by the government shutdown in October \u2013 the Department of Commerce said the pace of the US recovery had picked up. The health of the economy has been closely scrutinised by investors eager to gauge how soon the Fed will decide to \"taper\" the $85bn (\u00a352bn) a month bond-buying programme it has been using to try to kickstart growth. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, sparked a bout of chaos in world markets that became known as the \"taper tantrum\" earlier this year, after he suggested starting to withdraw the Fed's unprecedented programme of economic stimulus over the coming months. Experts have warned that this early estimate of GDP may be more tentative than usual, because the government shutdown may have hampered efforts to collect data. The BEA said that the acceleration in growth was broadly based, with consumer spending, stockbuilding by firms, state and local government spending, and property investment, all making a positive contribution. Thursday's data, which cover the third quarter of the year, do not yet reflect any damage inflicted on the US economy by the 16 day government shutdown that saw hundreds of thousands of public sector workers down tools in October as politicians on Capitol Hill wrangled over budget cuts. Another crucial indicator of the state of the US economy will come on Friday, with the delayed monthly jobs report. Bernanke has made unemployment the key indicator of when the Fed will choose to act, promising to leave interest rates on hold at least until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5% \u2014 provided inflation remains under control. The Fed's Open Market Committee will hold two more meetings before Bernanke bows out at the end of January, when he is expected to be replaced by Janet Yellen, if she can win over sceptical Senators at forthcoming confirmation hearings.",

    "webTitle": "Vodafone fails to hit legal minimum for 3G mobile internet coverage", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vodafone has been singled out by the telecoms watchdog for providing the poorest geographical coverage for 3G mobile internet in the UK after breaching the terms of its spectrum licence. Ofcom tests published on Thursday show that despite being the only British-owned operator in the country, Vodafone is also alone in having missed the legal obligation to extend 3G mobile coverage to 90% of the population by June this year. Ofcom plans to meet with all four networks in the coming weeks in response to growing consumer unrest about signal blackspots. Evidence gathered by the Guardian from over 1,000 readers shows many are reporting a deterioration since networks began rolling out 4G services. Vodafone is one of the largest mobile network operators in the world, but its investment in mobile internet in its home market has been behind rivals O2, which is owned by a Spanish company, the French and German joint venture EE, and the UK's smallest operator Three, which is part of a Hong Kong conglomerate. In 2010, in exchange for increasing the lease of 3G licences from 25 years to an indefinite duration, and releasing 4G spectrum to help speed up mobile broadband, the government increased the minimum coverage obligation for 3G from 80% to 90%. The deadline was 30 June, but Ofcom tests carried out that month showed Vodafone missed the target by 1.4%. It was the only network to fall short. The company has promised to boost its signal, but the work will not be complete until January 2014. If Vodafone misses the new deadline, Ofcom has the power to impose a fine of up to 10% of relevant turnover. Ofcom said: \"Vodafone has put in place a plan to bring itself into compliance with the 3G coverage obligation by the end of 2013. This will involve rolling out 3G to more mobile masts than Vodafone had originally estimated as being necessary. Ofcom has reviewed this plan, and believes it to be credible, but will closely monitor Vodafone's implementation of the plan.\" Vodafone will upgrade about 100 existing 2G sites to make them 3G sites in the run-up to Christmas \u2013 the sites were originally planned for upgrade in the first quarter of 2014. \"Our 3G licence includes an obligation to cover 90% of the population and Ofcom is fully aware of our plans to ensure compliance by the end of this year,\" a Vodafone UK spokesperson said. \"Our network investment stands at more than \u00a3900m this year alone and we remain on track to deliver indoor coverage across 2G, 3G and 4G to 98% of the population by 2015, two years ahead of the regulator's deadline.\" Ofcom's targets were not onerous. Under the rules networks must extend a signal to areas where 90% of the UK population live and work. This is less demanding than covering 90% of the landmass. In order to qualify masts had to be capable of delivering a signal to just one phone, at a speed of 768 kilobits per second. On a fixed line this speed would not qualify as broadband \u2013 Ofcom considers speeds of 2 Megabits per second as the minimum for home broadband. The regulator's tests were desk-based \u2013 using the actual location of masts and mathematical calculations to check whether they would reach theoretical test points located in population centres around the UK. Customers suffering from poor coverage at home or at work can report mobile signal blackspots on the Guardian's user-generated map, which will be updated over the coming days.",

The social media company will sell 70m shares priced at $26 each, valuing the company at more than $14bn when it lists on the New York Stock Exchange. The spread-betting firm IG is predicting the share price will spike initially, as investors rush to be part of the latest technology flotation. IG's grey market, which allows clients to take a view on how much Twitter will be worth after the first official day of trading, implies the shares will rise to $43.60 on debut day, valuing the company at $23.7bn. David Jones, chief market strategist at IG, said: \"At the moment, based on all the hype around it and our grey market, we are expecting a sharp rise when trading starts. Whether or not they hang on to the gains is to be seen. There are question marks over how money will be made in the years ahead.\" Twitter, based in San Francisco, will be hoping to avoid a repeat of Facebook's disastrous flotation last year. Facebook initially sold shares at the top end of its range but suffered technical glitches and the shares crashed shortly after the IPO. Twitter had already revised up its target price range to $23-$25 from $17-$20, before further increasing the price to $26 a share on Wednesday night after strong demand from investors. Twitter will have a total of 545m shares in issue, rising to about 695m when restricted stock and options are included, which takes valuation of the company at the initial price of $26 to $18bn. Twitter's IPO will make billions for some of Silicon Valley's top names, including the co-founders Ev Williams, who owns 59.6m shares and will add $1.47bn-plus to his net worth from the sale, and Jack Dorsey, who owns 23.4m shares. Twitter's other backers include Amazon's founder Jeff Bezos and Marc Andreessen, Netscape's founder turned serial investor. It will be the second largest US internet IPO on record, behind Facebook, and the third largest US IPO this year.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's manufacturers ramped up production in September, according to official figures, helping to keep hopes alive of an industrial renaissance, despite the news of nearly 1,800 shipbuilding job losses. The Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday that manufacturing output increased by a better than expected 1.2% in September, reversing the 1.2% drop a month earlier. The wider measure of industrial production, which also includes mining and quarrying, and energy supply, was up by a more modest 0.9%. The ONS said the relatively strong performance from manufacturing meant industrial production increased by 0.6% over the third quarter of the year \u2013 slightly higher than the 0.5% included in the first estimate of third-quarter GDP last month. City analysts said the figures suggested that, despite high-profile setbacks such as the loss of jobs at BAE dockyards, manufacturing was continuing to recover from the precipitous decline seen during the great recession of 2008-09. The coalition is hoping that a manufacturing revival \u2013 dubbed the \"march of the makers\" by the chancellor \u2013 will help to rebuild UK plc, and a continued improvement in the sector could help to assuage fears of a lopsided economic recovery that is too focused on consumer spending. \"A marked rebound in output in September from August's surprise drop indicates that the manufacturing sector's upturn remains intact and it enjoyed a very decent third quarter overall,\" said Howard Archer at the consultancy IHS Global Insight. However, overall industrial production still remains more than 12% below its peak in mid-2008. The ONS said the pharmaceutical sector \u2013 a long-time strength for the UK \u2013 had performed particularly strongly in September, as had transport, led by Britain's thriving carmakers, and computers. Lee Hopley, chief economist of the manufacturers' group the EEF, said: \"There were strong gains in pharmaceuticals, electronics and transport, with the latter benefiting from a combination of new products, solid overseas demand and longer order books. With signs pointing to firm activity in the final months of this year, our forecasts suggest that the second half of the year will be the strongest six-month period for the sector in three years.\" David Kern, chief economist at the British Chamber of Commerce, said: \"We remain cautiously optimistic about the sector's ability to recover despite the tough economic environment at home and abroad.\" Simon Wells, of HSBC, said it was not yet clear where the market was for the extra products manufacturers were churning out: \"The rapid pace of recovery raises the question as to where all the output is going. In the three months to August, UK goods exports contracted by 1.5% while industrial production rose 1.1%. \"This suggests output is being consumed domestically. Inventories or investment could be rising fast but given the fiscal consolidation and falling real wages, we continue to be surprised by the pace of recovery.\" He said the latest figures, together with a run of strong recent surveys from across the economy, would be likely to prompt the Bank of England to increase its growth forecast when it presents its quarterly inflation report next week. Consultancy PwC, in its latest assessment of the economy, published on Thursday, says it expects GDP growth to pick up steadily, from 1.4% this year to 2.4% in 2014: \"After a couple of sluggish years in 2011 and 2012, the UK economy is showing clear signs of recovery this year and is now gathering real momentum. The services sector has been leading the growth but latest data sources indicate that manufacturing and construction are also now starting to recover.\" Workers are unlikely to reap the benefits for some time, however: by 2017, PwC expects earnings to remain 6% below 2008 levels, in real terms. John Hawksworth, its chief economist, said: \"Upward pressure on energy and food prices could act as a restraint on growth, as could an eventual rise in interest rates later this decade.\"",

John Hawksworth, its chief economist, said: \"Upward pressure on energy and food prices could act as a restraint on growth, as could an eventual rise in interest rates later this decade.\"</p>",

Other studies have estimated that up to $32tr has gravitated in secrecy into offshore jurisdictions, much of it linked to tax evasion and avoidance activities. In a letter to the Queen John Christensen, director of TJN, calls on her to \"exert all possible influence\" to tackle \"harmful faultlines in the global economy\" created by UK-linked tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions. The TJN secrecy index makes for disappointing reading for David Cameron, who has sought to portray himself as being at the vanguard of international efforts to tackle tax-haven abuses, using Britain's presidency of the G8 to \"rewrite the rules on tax and transparency for the benefit of countries right across the world\". The prime minister won praise last week after announcing at the Open Government Partnership summit in London that the UK intended to require companies registered here to reveal the identity of their real owners in public filings at Companies House. Transparency campaigners point out that such an initiative from the UK becomes little more than a token gesture if it fails to extend to vehicles such as trusts and foundations as well as to well-known secrecy jurisdictions within the UK's orbit. \"None of the overseas territories or crown dependencies operate a properly transparent public register of offshore companies, trusts and foundations,\" writes Christensen, who in his early career worked in the trust industry on Jersey, later being appointed economic adviser to the island's government before quitting to become a tax and transparency campaigner. \"None obtain information on beneficial ownership and make this publicly available.
