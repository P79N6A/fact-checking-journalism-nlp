      "bodyText": "In Mexico it is known as \u201cel efecto Trump\u201d: a barrage of taunts and tweets that rattle the economy and hammer the peso. For the new president, it is part of a strategy to pressure companies to move jobs back to the United States. Mexico\u2019s job will be to suck it up, accept the millions of people Trump has promised to deport, and pay for the proposed border wall. Reality may soon disrupt this vision because Donald Trump, in one of the first great ironies of his presidency, has given impoverished Mexicans more reason to migrate to the US. The peso\u2019s slump against the dollar has dramatically driven up their cost of living, fuelling angry protests and steeling the resolve of some to sneak across the border. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a lot more people from the south coming up here to cross,\u201d said Paulino Hern\u00e1ndez, 38, seated in a Catholic-run migrant shelter in Tijuana, on the border with California. \u201cPeople are feeling bad. Everything has become so expensive. The dollar now goes a lot further.\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez, a construction worker who has lived illegally in San Diego since 2000, recently visited relatives in Oaxaca, in southern Mexico, and found young people clamouring to join him on his trip back to the US. \u201cThey want to go north.\u201d Trump stormed into the White House on vows to end an \u201cinvasion\u201d of \u201cillegals\u201d, deport millions of undocumented immigrants, and seal the border. The numbers trekking north had dwindled over the past decade as the Mexican economy improved, and the US economy struggled, but the mood now was bleak, and dreams of life in the US glowed anew, Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cMy nephew begged to come with me. He doesn\u2019t see a future in Mexico.\u201d Mexico\u2019s former president Felipe Calder\u00f3n recently tweeted a warning to America\u2019s new president: \u201cThe more jobs you destroy in Mexico, the more immigrants the American people will have. Think a little!\u201d Gordon Hanson, a UC San Diego economics professor who studies migration trends, said Trump had reversed the macro-economic climate and created uncertainty about Mexico\u2019s future. \u201cGreater instability could induce younger workers \u2026 to start their careers in the US. It does ironically increase the incentive to move north. Everything we\u2019re seeing now is the Trump effect.\u201d Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton jolted an economy left vulnerable by anaemic growth and faltering reforms. The peso swooned from 18 to the dollar to 20 in the election\u2019s immediate aftermath and slid again to 22 in recent days as Trump ratcheted up the pressure. He threw Mexico\u2019s car industry \u2013 a sizable employer \u2013into disarray by threatening Ford, Toyota, General Motors and other manufacturers with tariffs unless they shipped jobs to the US. Ford denied any connection but announced the cancellation of a planned $1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) plant in Villa de Reyes, saying it would expand a facility in Michigan. Trump greeted the move as \u201cjust the beginning\u201d. The president has also threatened to renegotiate trade terms, which sustain thousands of factories known as maquiladoras along Mexico\u2019s border. And to swipe remittances, money that immigrants in the US send to relatives in Mexico \u2013 a multibillion-dollar lifeline \u2013 to fund the wall. \u201cEvery time he says something, the peso weakens against the dollar,\u201d the El Mexicano newspaper lamented in an editorial after Trump\u2019s press conference last week. \u201cFrom those words, there are already results, a new blow against the Mexican economy.\u201d Frustration boiled over this month, after gasoline prices jumped 20% in the wake of energy deregulation. The \u201cgasolinazo\u201d will have a knock-on effect on the price of food and public transport. Protesters marched in cities across Mexico and blockaded some border crossings. \u201cI barely earn enough to eat,\u201d said \u00d3scar Rosas, 40, who earns the equivalent of $8 a day washing cars in Tijuana. He sleeps in a friend\u2019s car and wears donated, stained clothes. He yearns to cross the border fence and return to Los Angeles, home for 15 years until he was deported last year. \u201cLife is so much better there. Easier.\u201d Traditionally, migrants delay travel to spend Christmas at home, with numbers rising from late January. Any surge would probably be modest compared with the influxes of the 1990s. Fertility rates have plunged, so there are far fewer young people. And border security has tightened, making the crossing expensive \u2013 $7,000 is a common figure touted by smugglers \u2013 and perilous, a gauntlet of thieves and kidnappers, fierce temperatures and terrain, with only a 50/50 chance of eluding the border patrol checkpoints, sensors, cameras and aircraft. However, even a small uptick could reverse what was arguably the most overlooked fact of the presidential election: the Mexican influx has become a net outflow \u2013 more Mexicans are leaving the US than entering. \u201cIt would be an interesting effect of an attempt to reduce migrant flows across the border,\u201d said Mark Hugo Lopez, of the Pew Research Center. It would not all be due to Trump. \u201cMexico\u2019s own decisions are perhaps setting the stage for a growing migration trend north as gas price controls have been relaxed.\u201d The peso\u2019s weakness made a dollar income all the more alluring, said Hanson, the analyst. \u201cI\u2019d say in the short turn you\u2019ll certainly see increased pressures for migration.\u201d In the long run, those pressures could abate as Mexico\u2019s economy adjusted, especially if Trump\u2019s threats proved to be largely bluster, Hanson said. But if the president did overturn the economic order \u201cyou don\u2019t know what comes next\u201d. Father Pat Murphy, a Catholic priest who runs a migrant shelter in Tijuana, said a major concern was the US taxing remittances to help fund the wall. \u201cThat money is what holds people together here. If that gets cut it\u2019ll be another slap in the face of Mexico.\u201d In previous eras, undocumented migrants used to return to Mexico for weddings, funerals and Christmas, then slip back into the US. With border crossing now so fraught, fewer risk it. Hern\u00e1ndez regrets leaving his wife and children in San Diego to visit his mother and siblings in Oaxaca. Last week, purported coyotes \u2013 people-smugglers \u2013 kidnapped him and demanded a ransom from his wife. The former soldier escaped but lost his cash, phone and confidence about crossing. If Trump further bolsters security with his \u201cbig beautiful wall\u201d, undocumented immigrants will have all the more reason to never leave the US, he said. \u201cIf you get in, stay in.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The bungalows of Oxspring may look an unlikely testing ground for a new technology billed as a way to help renewable power, stymie energy price rises and aid the local power grid. But later this month, dozens of homes in this South Yorkshire village will have a home battery installed as part of a \u00a3250,000 trial to see if they can make solar power more valuable to homeowners and less painful for grid managers. Smaller than the high-profile Powerwalls introduced to the UK by Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla last year, the British-engineered batteries will be fitted for free in 30 homes with solar panels on their roofs and 10 without. The project is a response to what until recently would have seemed an improbable challenge for the UK: too much solar power. There are now 875,000 homes with solar photovoltaic panels, and that is beginning to pose issues for network operators. In Oxspring, a community energy company found it could only install solar panels at two in three homes because of constraints on the amount of power that can be pushed into the grid. Energy storage company Moixa and the local network operator, Northern Powergrid, hope their pilot will \u201ctimeshift\u201d solar for use at peak times and show storage can reduce network bottlenecks and cut out the need for costly upgrades, which would be passed on to energy bill-payers. \u201cIn northern Europe, solar produces the most energy when you don\u2019t need it [at midday]. The amount of solar in the UK is meaningful now, and that\u2019s translating to challenges [to grids] and costs to customers,\u201d said Simon Daniel, chief executive of Moixa, who sees better storage as the solution. The company has around 600 batteries in homes across the UK, which it aggregates to act like one big battery, effectively a virtual power station. The Oxspring householders will either benefit from using more of their solar power \u2013 the electricity is more valuable if consumed in the house rather than exported to the grid \u2013 while the non-solar homes will get a cheque of \u00a350-\u00a375 each year from Moixa for aiding the local network. The trial near Barnsley is just one sign of a growing energy storage market in Britain. Companies such as Tesla and London-based Powervault do not publish sales numbers, but Germany\u2019s Sonnen says it has sold hundreds of storage systems in the UK. The total installed is thought to be in the four figures. Most players have so far targeted householders hoping to increase the financial gain from their solar panels. But the introduction of time-of-day energy tariffs, enabled by smart meters, mean householders could potentially store electricity when it\u2019s cheap, for use later when it\u2019s pricier. Combined with the advent of rebates for \u201cgrid services\u201d to connected batteries such as the Oxspring ones, they could dramatically widen home batteries\u2019 appeal. Industry group the Electricity Storage Network describes 2017 as a \u201cwatershed\u201d year for the technology. Sonnen said it was receiving a surge of customer enquiries, and predicted the UK market would take off this year. Powervault, which says it wants to make home batteries as commonplace as dishwashers and washing machines, started a \u00a3625,000 trial in south-east England last month. The project with UK Power Networks involves batteries in 60 homes. \u201cThe purpose is to enable us to harness more of the solar energy that\u2019s generated during the day, when demand for energy is low, and release it onto the network at the morning and evening peaks,\u201d said a spokesman for UK Power Networks, the UK\u2019s biggest network operator. \u201cNational Grid spends about \u00a31bn a year balancing demand and supply of energy. Currently they pay that money largely to big power stations but in the future we\u2019ll move to a scenario where it also goes to a collective of batteries,\u201d said Joe Warren, MD of Powervault, which began selling home batteries in 2014. He said Tesla\u2019s arrival last year raised consumer awareness and argued that the market is big enough to sustain several companies: \u201cThere\u2019s definitely room for a British energy storage player.\u201d However, its US rival is upping the ante with a new, higher capacity version of its battery, which is in such demand that anyone buying one today can only get it in March at the earliest. Tesla, which earlier this month switched on the first sections of its battery-making Gigafactory in Nevada, begins installing the first of the new generation of Powerwall 2s in UK homes in February.",
