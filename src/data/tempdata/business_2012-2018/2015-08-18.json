      "bodyText": "Despite talk of confidence votes and elections, the Greek government appears to have put off any decision regarding political developments until next week. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: After an unusually intense August, the Greek government now appears determined not to act rashly. With European parliaments signing off on the bailout accord and the first aid disbursements looming, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has signaled that any political decision will be put on hold until next week when he has a more thorough overview of the economic situation. \u201cIn the next ten days decisions must be taken so that a road map is on the table,\u201d the government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili told the municipal radio station Athina 9,84 earlier today. It would be a \u201croad map\u201d that would take the debt-stricken country through to its first evaluation by international creditors of the measures Athens has agreed to implement in lieu of its third rescue programme. Asked whether the beleaguered government had set its heart on holding fresh elections, the spokeswoman did not rule out polls at the end of September but prevaricated. \u201cRight now, no decisions have been taken regarding the next steps \u2026. A lot has been heard about what will happen next but I can say with certainty that no decision has been taken about what will happen.\u201d Aides close to Tsipras said that at this point \u2013 with Greece only narrowly \u201csaved\u201d from bankruptcy and euro exit - any move had to be \u201ccareful\u201d and \u201cwithout risk.\u201d On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Another slump in the Chinese stock market - down 6% on the day - renewed concerns about the outlook for the world\u2019s second largest economy and pushed commodity prices - metals and oil - lower once more. So despite signs of progress on the Greek bailout, with a number of parliaments voting to back the agreement, investors were in cautious mood once more. By the close of play most markets had fallen back: The FTSE 100 lost 24.01 points or 0.37% to 6526.29, with mining shares among the biggest fallers Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.22% to 10,915.92 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.27% at 4971.25 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 0.08% lower at 23,389.72 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.02% down at 10,897.9 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 13 points or 0.07%. The European Central Bank has lowered the emergency liquidity assistance cap for Greek banks to \u20ac89.7bn, reports Reuters. This is said to be in line with a Greek central bank request. The bailout agreement of course allows for cash to help recapitalise the Greek banks. Here\u2019s Reuters take on the vote in the Spanish parliament to approve the third Greek bailout deal: Spanish lawmakers voted in favour of a third bailout package for Greece on Tuesday, with the centre-right government voicing misgivings about Greece\u2019s commitment to reforms but using its majority in parliament to approve the rescue. \u201cThere are serious risks, such as execution risks, given the Greekpolitical situation,\u201d Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told parliament in a special session on the deal Greece reached with its creditors, seen as helping it stay in the euro zone. \u201cThis isn\u2019t easy - the path ahead is still long and complex,\u201d de Guindos said. In a dig at anti-austerity parties such as Podemos that have gained traction in Spain in the past year, De Guindos took aim at the type of \u201cpopulist siren songs\u201d which he said had pushed Greece to the edge, under the helm of the leftist Syriza party. Spain faces a general election around November. The country is due to contribute some \u20ac10.1bn of the \u20ac86bn package for Greece. Germany\u2019s parliament is expected to give its crucial approval to the bailout deal on Wednesday. Some Spanish members of parliament railed against the rescue package, saying it did not benefit ordinary people in Greece, although only 20 lawmakers out of 322 voted against it. Alberto Garzon, leader of the Plural Left alliance, said the bailout obliged Greece to sell off public assets at knock-down prices and allocated too little to economic stimulus measures. Estonia also backed the Greek deal earlier: Here\u2019s the announcement (in Estonian) but the first paragraph translates (according to Google) as: Parliament approved at an extraordinary session of the European Commission and the Memorandum of Understanding concluded between the Greek draft, Estonia agrees to the Greek political agreement on the program of the third financial endorsement. Resolution of the Riigikogu \u201cThe European Commission and the Hellenic Republic entered into a Memorandum of Understanding between the draft approve\u201d (69 OE), by 50 and by 37 members of the Riigikogu. The Dutch parliament, which is due to discuss the third Greek bailout on Wednesday amid some reported disharmony among its coalition (\u00a3), has conveniently published all the documents related to the deal on its website. The voting in the Spanish parliament was reportedly as follows: 297 in favour 20 against 5 abstentions And after the debate, the Spanish parliament has also given its backing to the Greek deal. In Spain, parliament is beginning to vote. Meanwhile: In China, the central bank has injected $48bn of new capital in China Development Bank, which provides medium and long term financing for major national projects, according to the Xinhua agency. The move comes amid growing concerns about the outlook for the world\u2019s second largest economy, which prompted a 6% fall on the country\u2019s stock market earlier today. While we wait for news of the Spanish vote on the Greek bailout: In the US, Wall Street has opened lower in the wake of the 6% slump in Chinese shares, as well as disappointing quarterly figures from Wal-Mart. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 40 points or 0.2%. Earlier US housing starts rose 0.2% to a near eight year high in July, another sign of a stronger housing market and a possible interest rate rise next month. Back with the voting on the Greek bailout: Meanwhile Greece is still in talks with Germany\u2019s Fraport about a \u20ac1.2bn deal to operate 14 regional airports, says Reuters, despite earlier reports a deal had been done. A preliminary agreement was reached last year, and a report in the government gazette today was initially taken to mean the deal was done. But a government official said the announcement was just confirming a commitment to proceed with the plan under the previous terms. Now this is interesting..... There\u2019s a rumour that Alexis Tsipras might organised summer sessions in the Greek parliament, to help drive through the economic reforms agreed with lenders. \u201cSummer sessions\u201d sound rather cosy and fun; conjuring up visions of MPs sipping Pimms in deckchairs, perhaps, and occasionally passing the odd law. The reality is less relaxing, and more Machiavellian. It would mean that just 100 MPs debated the plans, not the full 300 -- and Tsipras could choose which government members turned up. Kathimerini reports: The aim of switching Parliament to a reduced summer session, where 100 MPs sit instead of the full 300, would be to allow him to choose which SYRIZA MPs attend the votes, thus removing rebel lawmakers and facilitating the passage of legislation pledged to lenders. According to sources, a presidential decree ordering Parliament to switch to its summer sessions has been drafted and only requires the signature of President Prokopis Pavlopoulos. If it happens, Tsipras could force unpopular measures into law, avoiding a confidence vote. It would clearly be controversial, though, especially given Tsipras\u2019s opposition to the whole notion in the past. Here are more highlights from the Spanish parliament\u2019s debate on Greece, via the Open Europe thinktank. First, economy minister Luis de Guindos: Guindos was followed by opposition Socialist Party\u2019s economics spokesman, Moscoso del Prado, who didn\u2019t hold back his criticism: Back to the other main issue, Greece\u2019s third bailout. Spain\u2019s parliament is now debating whether to support the \u20ac86bn loan programme. And the session began with economy minister Luis de Guindos warning that Athens could fail to meet its side of the bargain. \u201cThere are serious risks, such as execution risks, given the Greek political situation.... De Guindos also took a swipe at anti-austerity parties (such as Spain\u2019s Podemos) who argue against Europe\u2019s policy of austerity. As he put it: \u201cPopulist siren songs only end in mirages.\u201d Podemos are holding onto third place in the Spanish opinion polls, with a general election due before January. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our story on UK inflation inching back into positive territory, by Katie Allen: Britain\u2019s inflation rate ticked higher last month, heating up the debate over when Bank of England policymakers will start raising interest rates. The consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation edged up to 0.1% in July from zero the month before, defying City expectations for no change and pushing the pound higher. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said clothing prices were the main factor behind the rise, as shops offered fewer bargains in their summer sales. There was also some upward effect from airfares, which picked up more than last summer despite sharply lower oil prices. Those upward factors were only partially offset by falling food prices and cheaper diesel. \u201cThis is the sixth month running that headline inflation has been at or very close to zero. While households will have seen individual prices rise and fall, the overall shopping basket bought by the country remains little changed in price compared with a year ago,\u201d said ONS head of CPI Richard Campbell. Here\u2019s Katie\u2019s full piece: And Shane Hickey confirms that regulated rail fares are likely to rise by 1%, in line with RPI inflation. next year: Following the RPI figure announcement, the passenger watchdog TransportFocus said that while fares are increasing, punctuality is going down for many users. \u201cThe poor performance in the south-east in particular highlights how Network Rail and operators need to deliver a more consistent day-to-day service which passengers can rely on,\u201d the watchdog\u2019s passenger director, David Sidebottom, said. Wall Street\u2019s finest (?!) also reckon the UK consumer prices index may dip below zero again soon. Inflation could easily turn negative again this month, predicts Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club: \u201cJuly\u2019s uptick in inflation represents something of a false signal. The increase is largely due to clothing prices, with this year\u2019s summer sales seeing less discounting than last year\u2019s, and an increasing pressure on air fares. Overall, the modest pickup in inflation appears to be largely a function of temporary factors rather than a sign that inflationary pressures are escalating.\u201d The pound is continuing to climb, in a fillip to UK readers who haven\u2019t taken their summer holidays yet. Sterling is up over 1 cent against the dollar now, at $1.571, and also gained one eurocent to \u20ac1.418. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, cautions that the Bank of England will still be cautious about raising interest rates: \u201cWhile wages are increasing rapidly, this is clearly failing to filter through to inflation. With sterling\u2019s current strength and further fiscal tightness planned for the UK, if the MPC pulls the trigger too early on rate hikes it\u2019s difficult to see how the Bank of England\u2019s 2% inflation target will be reached in any reasonable timeframe. \u201cMaking an assumption that underlying price pressure will suddenly begin to pick up in the coming quarters is an awfully risky call. If the Bank of England has seemed indecisive over rate hikes in recent months, this inflation report is unlikely to give them any reason to get off the fence and act.\u201d UK house prices continue to outpace the official inflation rate. The average house price increased by 5.7% in the year to June 2015, up from 5.6% a month earlier, the Office for National Statistics reports. The East of England led the way, while price rises in the capital have slipped back: House prices are still outpacing wages, meaning young people in \u201cGeneration Rent\u201d face a major struggle reaching the bottom rung of the ladder. Richard Snook, senior economist at PwC, warns: Our recent research into this trend showed that by 2025 there will be more private renters than people owning a home with a mortgage, and that over half of the 20-39 age group will live in private rented accommodation. Today\u2019s figures show that house prices are growing at more than twice the rate of average earnings, further squeezing affordability for buyers. At just 0.1%, the UK inflation rate remains well shy of the 2% target which is meant to represent stability. The prime minister doesn\u2019t sound worried, though: Nick Dixon, Investment Director at Aegon UK, also believes the Bank of England will resist raising interest rates this year: \u201cToday\u2019s news confirming six months of flat prices will be welcomed by pensioners, with macroeconomics now swinging in their favour as they benefit from the \u2018triple lock\u2019 minimum pension increase of 2% per year. Inflation is being held back by the strong pound and lower oil prices, and is likely to remain minimal in the short term. The inflation figures also raise probability of the first rate hike since 2007 being after Christmas, not before.\u201d The jump in core inflation, to 1.2%, raises the chances that UK interest rates will rise in early 2016. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company Worldfirst.com, explains: \u201cInflation is positive in the UK, and positive for the UK. A period of ultra-low inflation is an obvious benefit for the UK economy \u2013 i.e. almost non-existent price rises in goods and services that consumers must buy, such as food and energy \u2013 frees up more disposable income elsewhere. It will also allow people to pay down debt and replenish savings that may have needed to be used during leaner times. This has been the driver of the UK recovery.\u201d \u201cThe key for policymakers is as long as core inflation \u2013 prices without these essentials \u2013 remain strong, then the Bank of England will continue to look through these headline declines as temporary and not as a reason to adjust their position towards rate hikes. The rise to 1.2% - the highest in 5 months \u2013 will flesh out the argument that domestic inflation is building and that the headline figure is only this low due to external factors \u2013 commodities and the pound. This is crucial for interest rate hikes and we maintain our calls for a February interest rate increase\u201d However, there are also some disinflationary forces on the horizon, Jeremy adds: Oil remains in a downtrend, as do most commodities. Sterling is stronger than it was this time last year by over 7% on a trade weighted basis and last week\u2019s moves by the People\u2019s Bank of China will see lower prices sweep in from the East in the next 6 months. For now however, consumers should take the low inflation as good news and leave the worrying to the men and women of Threadneedle Street [The bank of England]\u201d. Royal Bank of Scotland flags up some of the more interesting changes to inflation in the last year: George Osborne must be on holiday, as he\u2019s left the task of commenting on the inflation data to the newly ennobled Jim O\u2019Neill. Lord O\u2019Neill says low inflation is \u201cgreat news for working people and family budgets\u201d, but also warned that the global economic situation remains \u201cso uncertain\u201d. Britain\u2019s inflation rate is still close to its lowest level in 50 years, having briefly turned negative back in May: Food isn\u2019t the only thing keeping the cost of living down. Transport costs are also lower, thanks to cheaper petrol than a year ago. So, why did Britain\u2019s annual CPI inflation rate inch up to 0.1% last month? The Office for National Statistics says clothing prices fell at a slower rate than a year ago: Overall clothing and footwear prices fell by 3.4% between June and July this year compared with a larger fall of 5.7% between the same 2 months a year ago. Prices always fall between June and July during the summer sales period. The biggest downward contribution, once again, came from food and non-alcoholic beverages. Average prices fell by 0.7% between June and July, compared to a 0.2% fall between the same 2 months a year ago. The downward contribution came from price movements in most sectors \u2013 notably in the milk, cheese and eggs sector \u2013 where the prices of 2 pint cartons of shop bought milk have fallen. There was a partially offsetting contribution from rising prices in the bread and cereals sector. Last week, UK grocers agreed to pay guaranteed minimum prices to dairy farmers, after facing criticism for using milk as a weapon in their price wars. Negative inflation, more like.... Britain\u2019s rail users can expect fares to rise again next year, thanks to today\u2019s inflation figures. The Retail Prices Index, used to set regulated ticket prices, rose by 1.0% annually in July. Before May\u2019s election, the Conservative Party pledged to cap rail increases at RPI, so prices will follow in January. As we covered earlier, rail fares have been outstripping wages since 2010: The pound has just jumped by almost half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.565, as the inflation data hit the wires. One reason: core inflation, which strips out volatile factors like energy and food, jumped to 1.2% last month. That\u2019s a five-month high, suggesting underlying inflationary pressures are building, putting pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. Breaking: Britain\u2019s headline inflation rate turned positive, just, last month. The Consumer Prices Index rose by 0.1% in July, compared to a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics. That is up from 0.0% in June. Prices did dip by 0.3% month-on-month, though. More to follow.... The Greek government has made some small tweaks to country\u2019s capital control regime, reports Kathimerini: In legislation published late on Monday, the Finance Ministry now allows the transfer of \u20ac500 a month abroad. It also permits parents to send a lump sum of \u20ac8,000 abroad to cover the expenses of children who are studying outside of Greece. The previous limit was \u20ac5,000. Greeks will now be allowed to open bank accounts, which they had not been able to do since capital controls were introduced on June 29, but only for paying bills or servicing loans. They will not be able to withdraw cash from these accounts. The Open Europe think tank has a handy list of the eurozone governments which must approve the Greek bailout this week, including Spain, Estonia and Austria today: Here\u2019s the section on Estonia: An extraordinary parliamentary session has been called for today starting at noon. As with the other Baltic countries which underwent their own significant austerity and internal devaluation programme, sympathy for Greece in Estonia has been limited. However, the reform programme is likely to be seen as sufficient for approval. There may be trouble ahead. Ratings agency Moody\u2019s has predicted that the threat of a Chinese slowdown, US interest rate hikes, and Greece\u2019s problems will all hold back global growth over the next two years. Here\u2019s the full story: Europe\u2019s stock markets are now falling, as the Chinese rout hits confidence in the City. The FTSE 100 is down 27 points, or 0.4%, at 6522, led by mining stocks such as Antofagasta (-2%). Today wasn\u2019t a good day to be playing the Chinese financial markets. As these photos show, share charts were a sea of green (for losses) as the Shanghai composite index plunged by over 6%. Today\u2019s UK inflation data, released in around 30 minutes, is particularly important to commuters. July\u2019s Retail Prices Index (RPI) will be used to set regulated rail fares in 2016. It\u2019s expected to come in at 1% (compared to 0% for the CPI). The government has pledged to cap rail fare increases at RPI, but that hasn\u2019t deterred unions from protesting this morning - pointing out that regulated fares have increased by 25% since 2010, while the average pay packet grew by just 9%. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s positive comments about Greece hide his true long-term objectives, reckons Alastair Winter, chief economist at Daniel Stewart &amp; Co: Yesterday, rumours were swirling that Greece\u2019s prime minister would call a confidence vote soon, having suffered his own rebellions over the bailout deal. But Greek newspaper Kathimerini now reckons Alexis Tsipras may resist this move, which could trigger elections, while he gets to grips with the measures agreed with lenders. They write: Government sources suggested on Monday that Tsipras first wants to discuss with his economic team how the first tranche of Greece\u2019s third bailout, which was passed through Parliament on Friday and then rubber-stamped by eurozone finance ministers, will be disbursed. Athens is due to receive \u20ac26bn of the total \u20ac86bn as its first installment but this will be broken into sub-tranches, with \u20ac10bn going toward recapitalizing Greek banks. The prime minister also wants to be briefed on what measures the government will have to adopt over the next few weeks in order to comply with the bailout terms and ensure that there will be no complications when the lenders\u2019 technical teams return in October to review the program\u2019s implementation. \u201cWe cannot put at risk the smooth implementation of the agreement,\u201d said a government source who preferred to remain anonymous. Tsipras is likely to lose any confidence vote, as left-wing rebels in his party are signalling that they would not back him: Steve Wang, chief China economist at Reorient Financial Markets Ltd, believes Chinese investors panicked today and lost faith that Beijing would keep propping up share prices. Wang said (via Bloomberg): \u201cInvestors ran for the exit when the government failed to step in to support the market.\u201d The Chinese stock market has suffered another selloff today, as fears of economic slowdown rip through trading rooms. The main Shanghai index plunged by over 6% in the last hour of trading, the biggest fall in around three weeks. The selloff came after the yuan fell against the US dollar, and data showed that monthly house price growth slowed to + 0.3% in July. Whatever the reason for the rout, it won\u2019t make investors any less worried about China: Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble sounded remarkably upbeat in his interview with ZDF last night, arguing that Athens has made significant progress recently. As he put it: \u201cIn the last weeks, things have moved much more quickly than most of my colleagues would have thought possible. Let\u2019s hope that this surge forward continues then Greece really has a chance and we have every interest in it succeeding.\u201d Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s old sparring partner, Yanis Varoufakis, might raise his eyebrows at such talk. Yesterday, the ex Greek finance minister deftly filleted the bailout agreement, to show how its financial targets are too ambitious, while its economic reforms remain flawed. Overnight, Germany\u2019s finance minister did his best to avoid a major rebellion over the third Greek bailout. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told German public broadcaster ZDF that MPs should vote for the plan tomorrow. You\u2019ll remember that Sch\u00e4uble had pushed the idea of a temporary Grexit at last month\u2019s crisis summit in Brussels, so clearly he must have qualms about the way things turned out. But still, he told ZDF that: \u201cI can argue with full conviction, partly because I haven\u2019t taken this decision lightly myself ... that the right thing to do is to vote for this.\u201d Sch\u00e4uble added that he\u2019s \u201csure\u201d that the International Monetary Fund will decide to take part in the programme, something Germany sees as essential. The Fund won\u2019t make that decision until the autumn, though. Analysts had calculated that up to 120 MPs from the CDU/CSU bloc could defy chancellor Merkel and reject the terms of the deal. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s intervention might persuade a few potential rebels to sit tight. We\u2019ll find out tomorrow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Greece will move another few steps closer to receiving its third bailout today. The parliaments of Spain and Estonia are both voting on the plan, while a special subcommittee in Austria will also give the thumbs-up, or down, during the day. That\u2019ll be an entr\u00e9e before the main event, the Bundestag vote, on Wednesday, where Angela Merkel could face a sizeable rebellion from her own CDU/CSU MPs. And in the UK, we get the latest inflation data at 9.30am BST. That could show that the cost of living remained flat again, although a dip into negative inflation can\u2019t be ruled out...... The data will help inform the debate on when UK interest rates might rise. Last month, the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee voted 8-1 to leave borrowing costs unchanged. But one policymaker, Kristin Forbes, has warned that Britain risks a nasty dose of sunburn if it lingers in the warm glow of ultra-low borrowing for too long. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

With European parliaments signing off on the bailout accord and the first aid disbursements looming, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has signaled that any political decision will be put on hold until next week when he has a more thorough overview of the economic situation.</p> <p>\u201cIn the next ten days decisions must be taken so that a road map is on the table,\u201d the government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili told the municipal radio station Athina 9,84 earlier today. </p> <p>It would be a \u201croad map\u201d that would take the debt-stricken country through to its first evaluation by international creditors of the measures Athens has agreed to implement in lieu of its third rescue programme. </p> <p>Asked whether the beleaguered government had set its heart on holding fresh elections, the spokeswoman did not rule out polls at the end of September but prevaricated. \u201cRight now, no decisions have been taken regarding the next steps \u2026. A lot has been heard about what will happen next but I can say with certainty that no decision has been taken about what will happen.\u201d </p> <p>Aides close to Tsipras said that at this point \u2013 with Greece only narrowly \u201csaved\u201d from bankruptcy and euro exit - any move had to be \u201ccareful\u201d and \u201cwithout risk.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p><em><strong>On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening.

This has been the driver of the UK recovery.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cThe key for policymakers is as long as core inflation \u2013 prices without these essentials \u2013 remain strong, then the Bank of England will continue to look through these headline declines as temporary and not as a reason to adjust their position towards rate hikes. The rise to 1.2% - the highest in 5 months \u2013 will flesh out the argument that domestic inflation is building and that the headline figure is only this low due to external factors \u2013 commodities and the pound. This is crucial for interest rate hikes and we maintain our calls for a February interest rate increase\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>However, there are also some disinflationary forces on the horizon, Jeremy adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Oil remains in a downtrend, as do most commodities. Sterling is stronger than it was this time last year by over 7% on a trade weighted basis and last week\u2019s moves by the People\u2019s Bank of China will see lower prices sweep in from the East in the next 6 months. For now however, consumers should take the low inflation as good news and leave the worrying to the men and women of Threadneedle Street [The bank of England]\u201d.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-08-18T10:24:18.804Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55d2f61ae4b03387562137f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-08-18T09:12:17.898Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Royal Bank of Scotland flags up some of the more interesting changes to inflation in the last year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RBS_Economics/statuses/633565722048901120\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Micro matters too.

They were airlifted to University of New Mexico Hospital\u2019s Level 1 Trauma Center with third-degree burns from a presumed butane reaction.</p> <p>Later that night, long after the emergency vehicles had pulled away, federal Drug Enforcement Agency agents arrived. \u201cThey seized all the growing marijuana plants, all the cannabis products in the manufacturing facility \u2013 the edibles, the extracts, everything,\u201d says attorney Marc Lowry. Approximately 150 plants were uprooted and confiscated. Lowry conservatively values the loss at $250,000, but a good crop \u201ccould have easily yielded two to three times that much\u201d.</p> <p>While Lowry believes the explosion occurred during the extraction process, the cause is \u201cstill under investigation\u201d, according to police spokeswoman Lt Andrea Dobyns. \u201cWe\u2019ve never experienced an explosion like this in a dispensary and were unable to secure the lab safely. So the DEA was called. Once they arrived on scene, they found evidence of violations and opened up a separate investigation.\u201d</p> <p> The dispensary \u2013 which has 36 employees and 5,700 registered patients, according to owner Len Goodman \u2013 was able to reopen last week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/12/california-wildfires-marijuana-farms\">California marijuana farms at risk as weed smoke could rise from wildfires</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why the DEA opened an investigation, and whether or not the seized cannabis products will ever be returned to Goodman, remains unclear. \u201cThat\u2019s a very good question \u2026 I don\u2019t I know the definitive answer to that,\u201d says Lowry. </p> <p>Licensed medical marijuana dispensaries in the 23 states where medicinal cannabis is legal and Washington DC are operating in a tricky gray zone. On one hand, the states recognize cannabis as a legal medical substance. On the other, cannabis is listed under the federal Controlled Substances Act as a drug with \u201cno currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse\u201d. As such, small, legal dispensaries can be wiped out by a single visit from law enforcement.</p> <p>\u201cUnder federal law \u2013 whether medical or not \u2013 it\u2019s contraband,\u201d says Lowry. \u201cWe have this unique situation in the history of controlled substances, where the Department of Justice is turning a blind eye to state-run medical programs as long as they are not engaging in the \u2018eight areas of concern\u2019.\u201d </p> <p>This list \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/3052013829132756857467.pdf\">issued by the US Justice Department</a> \u2013 includes distribution to minors, revenue feeding criminal enterprises and violence, and the use of firearms in the cultivation or distribution of cannabis.</p> <p> If state law enforcement had seized New MexiCann\u2019s plants and cannabis products, \u201cthere would be immunities \u2013 once you show you are a legal dispensary, if a product is seized it has to be returned,\u201d says Lowry. \u201cBut when it\u2019s a federal agency, which treats cannabis as an illicit contraband, that\u2019s not the case. Federal law trumps state law.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>When local law enforcement gets involved</strong></h2> <p> On a Monday morning in June, El Dorado County Sheriff deputies entered the Tahoe Wellness Cooperative in Lake Tahoe, California, seizing all of its cannabis products, marijuana plants, cash and medical records.</p> <p> No charges have been filed, and the dispensary, which has approximately 20 full-time employees and sees an estimated 250 patients on a daily basis, was able to reopen the next day. </p> <p>Attorney Henry Wykowski says law enforcement has yet to provide him with a reason for the search warrant: \u201cThe affidavit was filed under seal. I\u2019ve tried to talk to the DA, but they won\u2019t disclose any information.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy understanding is that warrants were served and evidenced was seized,\u201d says El Dorado deputy district attorney Worth Dikeman. The County Attorney General\u2019s Office and Attorney General\u2019s office are \u201creviewing the evidence\u201d. \u201cWe haven\u2019t receive any charges, so I\u2019m in no position to comment,\u201d says Dikeman.</p> <p> The lack of information hasn\u2019t stopped Wykowski from developing his own theory, one that centers on Tahoe Wellness owner Cody Bass\u2019s vocal critique of El Dorado sheriff deputy Mark Zlendick, who was <a href=\"http://www.kcra.com/news/local-news/news-sierra/el-dorado-county-sheriffs-deputy-faces-drug-charges/33134320\">recently arrested on methamphetamine possession and trafficking charges</a>. (Bass had scheduled a call to action to raise awareness of Zlendick\u2019s arrest for the day after officers arrived at Tahoe Wellness.) </p> <p>\u201cIt was punitive,\u201d says Wykowski, adding that Lake Tahoe city officials \u201chad no advanced knowledge\u201d of the raid, and have since voiced their support for the dispensary.</p> <p> The investigation at Tahoe Wellness Collective is just one in a recent rash in California. While states such as Colorado, <a href=\"https://composer.gutools.co.uk/content/55d20649e4b05b3db07e1510#dispensary\">Oregon</a> and New Mexico have enacted statewide regulations for medical marijuana dispensaries, California has not. (Apart from New MexiCann, Lowry is unaware \u201cof any other dispensary in the state to have suffered a loss due to law enforcement involvement\u201d.)</p> <p>As a result, dispensaries in California are more vulnerable to city and county raids because the standards that separate a legal dispensary from an illegal one are ill-defined and contradictory, says Wykowski. Often, California\u2019s city and state laws regarding medical cannabis conflict with one another, which means a dispensary may be in compliance with state but not city law.</p> <p> The patchwork nature of the golden state\u2019s regulation of medical cannabis has created a cloud of uncertainty and lack of transparency in the industry, says Steve DeAngelo, founder of the Oakland, California-based Harborside Health Center, one of the largest dispensaries in California. </p> <p> \u201cThere is a lot of ambiguity in regards to why one guy gets raided and another one doesn\u2019t,\u201d says Wykowski. \u201cIt\u2019s grossly unfair to people who are trying to do it right.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Caught on camera</strong></h2> <p> About a week before and nearly 400 miles south of the investigation at Tahoe Wellness Collective, Santa Ana police officers entered Sky High Holistic Collective, guns drawn. It was an early evening in late May. Footage from a camera in the dispensary\u2019s lobby shows the officers ordering employees and customers to get on the ground. Once inside, they smash the shop\u2019s surveillance cameras. Save for one.</p> <p>Shortly after the raid, attorney Matthew Pappas released edited <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTKTfUHfeKM\">video footage</a> captured by the undamaged camera to the OC Weekly and the Voice of OC; he has since released the raw footage to the Santa Ana Police Department.

Furthermore, the lawsuit claims that because the majority of the cameras at Sky High Holistic were destroyed, the police officers had a reasonable expectation that their actions were not being recorded \u2013 and thus the tape should be banned from use in implementing any punitive action. <a href=\"http://www.ocregister.com/articles/officers-677403-police-video.html\">A judge is expected to rule on the case</a> early this week. </p> <h2><strong>Licenses via lottery</strong></h2> <p>While Sky High Holistic was operating in compliance with state law, it did not have a permit from Santa Ana, which recently passed the voter-backed, city-approved Measure BB, which caps the number of dispensaries in the county at 20. </p> <p>In February, Santa Ana held a lottery, overseen by an independent accounting firm, in which the 20 licenses were granted. Because lottery applications were not limited per corporate entity, Pappas says most tickets went to wealthy entrepreneurs who bought them in bulk \u2013 he\u2019s also filed a suit alleging that Mayor Miguel Pulido, and other city officials, received money, gifts and were taken to expensive dinners around the time Measure BB was introduced to the city council.</p> <p>Dispensaries whose owners did not win a lottery ticket, including Sky High Holistic, were operating illegally in the eyes of the city, if not those of the state. </p> <p>According to Bertagna, the appropriate response from law enforcement when a dispensary is operating \u201cin violation of municipal code\u201d is to first contact the dispensary owners and tell them to cease operations. Next, between 24 to 48 hours later, officers will return and post a sign on the dispensary. If operations continue, undercover officers will make an illegal buy in order to obtain a search warrant. In the case of Sky High Holistic all of these steps were followed, Bertagna says. </p> <p>Pappas remains incensed at the use of force for a municipal misdemeanor violation: \u201cThey are acting like Nazi officers in what they are doing to these folks \u2026 these disabled individuals who are being discriminated against.\u201d</p> <p>He estimates the officers caused more than $200,000 in property damages. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd0dda779775ee10115f8f97a68b7f3c7ccc7786\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/18/1439914702538/065044ca-8e17-4089-ac6b-52829f0c5436-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Differing city, county and state laws get at the heart of California\u2019s untenable piecemeal approach to marijuana regulation.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Differing city, county and state laws get at the heart of California\u2019s untenable piecemeal approach to marijuana regulation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Lack of regulation failing the industry</h2> <p>Differing city, county and state laws get at the heart of California\u2019s untenable piecemeal approach to marijuana regulation, says Dale Sky Jones, executive chancellor of <a href=\"http://oaksterdamuniversity.com/\">Oaksterdam University</a>, which offers training for the cannabis industry. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need regulation, to weed out bad operators based on performance,\u201d says Jones. \u201cWhen licenses are handed out in a lottery instead of for quality, we will continue to see raids on businesses that did not make the cut.\u201d</p> <p> Jones is campaigning for a regulatory structure for California\u2019s medical cannabis program.

      "bodyText": "Andrew Chen, an investor in the San Francisco Bay Area, used to think that reaching zero in one\u2019s inbox was folklore. The tech entrepreneur now uses an app, Streak, to regularly clear his emails. He also gets all his scheduling done with the help of another digital time manager, Esper. Time management apps have proliferated over the past few years as consumers increasingly try to squeeze more productivity out of their waking \u2013 and even sleeping \u2013 hours. Users hoping to curtail their time on Facebook and squeeze in more hours at the gym have flocked to apps like RescueTime and Toggl. You define the tasks and set the app to measure how long you spend on them. \u201cFor me, time management tools are super important,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWhen you are in [a] tech job, the scarcest thing is your own attention and other peoples\u2019 attention. Money isn\u2019t usually the bottleneck. So you need tools to help manage this scarce resource, so you can maximize it.\u201d People have always sought to maximize their 24 hours. Now, where analog to-do-lists once sufficed, the toolbox for increasing efficiency has greatly expanded. Data gathering is the first step. \u201cIn the United States, there is this big wave of self-quantification,\u201d said Khiv Singh, an assistant vice president at Sapience, which recently launched a personal time management tool called Sapience Buddy. Although the majority of his company\u2019s clients are in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe, he said Americans were the ones requesting a way to track personal data. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing especially new about the desire to be productive,\u201d said Melissa Gregg, a principal engineer at Intel who is researching the future of work and is author of the forthcoming book Counterproductive, which focuses on time management at work. \u201cIt\u2019s more we have the technology and capacity to do that in more interesting ways.\u201d Gregg and her team recently reviewed 50 time management apps and found that they ranged from calendaring, note taking and file-sharing tools to mindfulness meditation apps that remind users to take breaks and stay focused. Developers of some of the most popular personal time management apps, such as Timely, ATracker and Toggl, are now creating or expanding office versions for business customers by the end of the year. Because apps that make people feel like they\u2019re squeezing more into each day can lead to a die-hard customer base, many of these companies are counting on their existing users to passionately promote their apps to their employers when the subjects of productivity and prioritizing arise in the office. Done right, Gregg said: \u201cIt actually does take the place of a spiritual or religious dimension for some people.\u201d As an internal exercise, Gregg said her team recently held a pitching panel in which each employee could advocate for the adoption of his or her favorite app. Time management tools designed for an office may be more complex than those for personal use, and they may also need to accommodate different types of data reporting. For example, a company has to choose between apps that live on an employee\u2019s hard drive and those that store information in the cloud. An effective business app also needs to separate personal from professional tasks and let an employee choose to report only work-related data to avoid potential violations of privacy or other legal grey areas. A product that works well for some employees and managers may also be less effective for others, depending on the variety of work styles and culture within an organization. Developers of time management apps are considering all of these questions as they expand their product offerings and using feedback from early adopters to help work out bugs and accommodate a wide range of tasks. \u201cWe want to end up at the large corporations,\u201d said Mathias Mikkelsen, CEO and founder of Timely, which is mostly used by the self-employed, such as writers and marketers. \u201cIt\u2019s way better to start with the individual view. Nail that experience, and then go at the whole company.\u201d Although app developers claim their software can increase productivity, few have the hard data to demonstrate increased efficiency. \u201cThere\u2019s really not that much good research around on these apps, especially because they\u2019re so different from each other,\u201d said Dan Ariely, a behavioral economist at Duke University and co-founder of Timeful, a time management system that was acquired by Google in May. Google said in a statement that it planned to incorporate Timeful\u2019s features into its inbox and calendaring systems in addition to other products. Most time management apps are based on what Gregg describes as \u201cthe advice and pseudoscience of the time management of the 70s.\u201d That is, a compelling type of self-help philosophy that claims to be grounded in science without the research or evidence to back it up. Here are some guidelines from time management experts for individuals and companies seeking to adopt better time management practices. Look at the big picture The ideal time management app should help an employee focus on what he or she wants to achieve, not just keep track of their minutes. \u201cIf you think about what your real priorities are versus what you end up doing in the day, those are not often the same thing. So any software that uses the priority approach is a very good thing,\u201d Ariely said. Setting priorities requires a fair amount of offline thinking and decision-making about what\u2019s important in a day, a week or a year. Managers should not expect apps to replace their discussions with employees about planning work and setting deadlines. \u201cTime management apps are very good at managing time if you already decide you want to spend X amount of time on something,\u201d Gregg said. \u201cBut it\u2019s still up to the human to prioritize the task \u2013 to make sure the thing you choose to do is really the most important thing to do right now.\u201d Give employees control There tends to be a reflexive \u201cick\u201d response from workers when they think their bosses could be peeking into their time management tools to learn about their work habits or how they spend their personal time. \u201cI would be very worried as an employee once I start turning on something that monitors my online activity,\u201d said Gloria Mark, an informatics professor at the University of California at Irvine. One way to prevent any real or perceived privacy intrusion is to let an employee know how and when he\u2019s being tracked, and to let him be the one who directs that information back to his employer. Some employers prefer apps that allow different levels of oversight. For example, ATracker, which is used by some hospitals, lets healthcare providers decide what information they want to track, such as the time spent on an operation or with a patient, but the hospitals can let the doctors decide when and whether to generate reports from that data and send them to administrators, founder Jian Yan said. An employee should also be able to sit with the data before sending and be able to decide when to hit the send button. If the employee does not feel he has time to review the data, then he may lose hours of his workday trying to make himself look productive instead of being productive. \u201cWhen we make that data transparent to others, that\u2019s where we get into a situation where we start manipulating our activities to create good data,\u201d said Ethan Bernstein, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School who has studied workplace transparency. \u201cIf you\u2019re running experiments on how you\u2019re managing your time, you tend to want the results to be yours before someone comes and questions you about them.\u201d Companies like Twitter, Uber and Foursquare use lower tech apps like iDoneThis, which generates an evening email reminder that employees respond to with a summary of what they accomplished that day. The idea is to motivate employees to get more done because they know the email is coming. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a lightweight way to see what everyone is working on. It doesn\u2019t have a lot of those negative connotations,\u201d said Walter Chen, iDoneThis co-founder. Listen to employee feedback Because many individuals already use time management apps, it may be hard for businesses to convince their employees to switch to a different system at work from the ones they already use on their own. The best time management system works because it becomes part of an employee\u2019s daily ritual, so swapping a new ritual for a less appealing alternative might negatively impact productivity. The guiding principal behind time management is to restore a person\u2019s sense of control to her day. \u201cYou lose the benefit if you make it compulsory,\u201d Gregg said. You also lose the benefit if the app becomes the day\u2019s focal point. Time management tools should be a means to increased productivity, not just another task to accomplish before heading home from work. If an app becomes a distraction, it\u2019s probably better to go back to pen and paper and write an old-fashioned to-do list.",

    "webTitle": "Asda records worst-ever quarterly sales figures", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Asda has had its worst sales performance in its 50 year history, hit by ferocious competition for customers in which rivals have slashed prices and issued millions of discount vouchers. Asda boss Andy Clarke insisted the supermarket had reached its \u201cnadir\u201d and would bounce back after revealing a 4.7% fall in sales at established stores in the three months to 30 June. The decline cements Asda\u2019s position as the worst performer of the UK\u2019s big four grocers, which have all recorded falling sales amid a slide in the cost of food commodities and a price war sparked by the rising popularity of discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Last month, Asda lost its position as the UK\u2019s second-biggest supermarket to Sainsbury\u2019s. In May, it had revealed a 3.9% fall in sales at its established stores for the 15 weeks to 19 April, already the Walmart-owned chain\u2019s worst sales figures since the 1990s. Clarke said: \u201cThe market is in exceptionally challenging times ... We have certainly hit our nadir. Every business has got to have one and this is ours. We are on an upward trend and we have got positive green shoots [in the coming quarter].\u201d He hinted that the retailer was seeing a rise in underlying sales and dismissed rivals\u2019 price cuts as a \u201cshort-term position to drive traffic\u201d, which could not be sustained. Clarke, the longest-serving boss of the major UK grocers, said Asda had the right strategy, despite the performance slipping further from the previous quarter. He said the US owners were right behind him and any rumours that he was under pressure to leave were wrong. \u201cLet\u2019s silence that one. I\u2019m here presenting today\u2019s results and I\u2019m here to stay,\u201d Clarke said. \u201c[The strategy] is working and we are wholly committed, as our parents are, to seeing it through no matter what the short-term disruption might be around us.\u201d He said Asda\u2019s profit margins remained steady compared with last year, while it had not been forced to write off dozens of unwanted stores or development sites like rivals Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons. But Clarke admitted Asda needed to speed up its efforts to improve online shopping services and the quality of fresh food, as well as the expansion of its George brand and the move into petrol forecourts to win back shoppers. Asda will invest a quarter more on the quality of its food in the second half of its financial year than it did in the same period last year. It has also changed its marketing to flag up services in its bigger stores, such as online shopping pickup points, petrol pumps and opticians, as well as cheap prices. The retailer\u2019s traditional emphasis on price had begun to look stale in a market saturated with red banners, discount vouchers and tough competition from Aldi and Lidl which remain considerably cheaper than Asda on their limited basket of goods. Clarke said Asda was continuing to invest in price cuts with the objective of narrowing the gap with discounters and at least maintaining its lead on rivals Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s. \u201cWe have broadened our appeal giving us real confidence as we move forward,\u201d he added. Asda has been one of the biggest losers amid a nascent recovery at Tesco, which has been cutting prices and putting thousands more staff back into stores in an attempt to improve service. The Walmart-owned chain has also suffered because the vast majority of its stores are out-of-town supermarkets, which have lost favour with shoppers who are increasingly turning to small local stores. The supermarket is belatedly trying to get a foot in that game by moving into petrol forecourt stores. It is in the process of converting 15 petrol stations it bought last year. Clarke said in May that Asda expected to have 100 such outlets within the next five years. Asda\u2019s poor sales figures come after a tough few weeks in which dairy farmers marched cows through its stores in protest at low prices they were being paid for milk. Asda pledged last week to raise the amount it paid farmers per litre to 28p. But Clarke said on Tuesday that it would not promise to pay farmers a minimum based on the cost of production in the same way as Tesco or Sainsbury\u2019s. He said Asda\u2019s deal with the Arla milk processing group, which is owned by farmers, gave them the best overall deal on milk and other dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt. Until the last fortnight, Arla was paying farmers one of the lowest prices in the market. Rival opens new front in price war Sainsbury\u2019s is opening a new front in the price war with Asda by taking its Brand Match promotion online. The scheme promises money-off vouchers if shoppers could have bought goods cheaper at Asda, as long as they put at least 10 items in their basket. The supermarket has been running the scheme in stores for four years after it was originally dreamt up by Mike Coupe, now the chief executive. Initially it matched prices against both Tesco and Asda but Tesco was excluded from the scheme last September. Sainsbury\u2019s said it was taking the Brand Match online because of customer demand. Last year the supermarket chain issued more than 230m coupons under the scheme with more than half showing a comparable branded shop was cheaper at Sainsbury\u2019s compared with Asda. The supermarket is also likely to be hoping to boost the pace of sales growth. Sainsbury\u2019s online sales rose just 7% in the year to March compared with an 11.5% rise in online grocery sales at Tesco and 19.6% at Asda last year. The supermarket also recently launched its clothing brand Tu online across the country.",

      "body": "<p>Asda has had its worst sales performance in its 50 year history, hit by ferocious competition for customers in which rivals have slashed prices and issued millions of discount vouchers.</p> <p>Asda boss Andy Clarke insisted the supermarket had reached its \u201cnadir\u201d and would bounce back after revealing a 4.7% fall in sales at established stores in the three months to 30 June.</p> <p>The decline cements Asda\u2019s position as the worst performer of the UK\u2019s big four grocers, which have all recorded falling sales amid a slide in the cost of food commodities and a price war sparked by the rising popularity of discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. </p> <p>Last month, Asda <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/28/sainsburys-becomes-uks-second-biggest-supermarket\">lost its position as the UK\u2019s second-biggest supermarket</a> to Sainsbury\u2019s. In May, it had revealed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/19/asdas-sales-fall-of-39-worse-than-tesco-sainsburys-and-morrisons\">a 3.9% fall in sales at its established stores</a> for the 15 weeks to 19 April, already the Walmart-owned chain\u2019s worst sales figures since the 1990s. </p> <p>Clarke said: \u201cThe market is in exceptionally challenging times ... We have certainly hit our nadir. Every business has got to have one and this is ours. We are on an upward trend and we have got positive green shoots [in the coming quarter].\u201d </p> <p>He hinted that the retailer was seeing a rise in underlying sales and dismissed rivals\u2019 price cuts as a \u201cshort-term position to drive traffic\u201d, which could not be sustained. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/13/value-uk-milk-sales-plummet-pressure-mounts-dairy-farmers\">Asda raises price paid to dairy farmer as value of milk sales plummets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clarke, the longest-serving boss of the major UK grocers, said Asda had the right strategy, despite the performance slipping further from the previous quarter.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>He said the US owners were right behind him and any rumours that he was under pressure to leave were wrong. \u201cLet\u2019s silence that one. I\u2019m here presenting today\u2019s results and I\u2019m here to stay,\u201d Clarke said. \u201c[The strategy] is working and we are wholly committed, as our parents are, to seeing it through no matter what the short-term disruption might be around us.\u201d</p> <p>He said Asda\u2019s profit margins remained steady compared with last year, while it had not been forced to write off dozens of unwanted stores or development sites like rivals Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons.</p> <p>But Clarke admitted Asda needed to speed up its efforts to improve online shopping services and the quality of fresh food, as well as the expansion of its George brand and the move into petrol forecourts to win back shoppers. </p> <p>Asda will invest a quarter more on the quality of its food in the second half of its financial year than it did in the same period last year. It has also changed its marketing to flag up services in its bigger stores, such as online shopping pickup points, petrol pumps and opticians, as well as cheap prices. </p> <p>The retailer\u2019s traditional emphasis on price had begun to look stale in a market saturated with red banners, discount vouchers and tough competition from Aldi and Lidl which remain considerably cheaper than Asda on their limited basket of goods.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/18/walmart-cuts-annual-earnings-outlook\">Walmart cuts annual earnings outlook after drop in second-quarter profits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clarke said Asda was continuing to invest in price cuts with the objective of narrowing the gap with discounters and at least maintaining its lead on rivals Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s. \u201cWe have broadened our appeal giving us real confidence as we move forward,\u201d he added. </p> <p>Asda has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/10/asda-shows-worst-its-sales-performance-in-20-years\">one of the biggest losers amid a nascent recovery at Tesco</a>, which has been cutting prices and putting thousands more staff back into stores in an attempt to improve service.</p> <p>The Walmart-owned chain has also suffered because the vast majority of its stores are out-of-town supermarkets, which have lost favour with shoppers who are increasingly turning to small local stores. </p> <p>The supermarket is belatedly trying to get a foot in that game by moving into petrol forecourt stores. It is in the process of converting 15 petrol stations it bought last year. Clarke said in May that Asda expected to have 100 such outlets within the next five years. </p> <p>Asda\u2019s poor sales figures come after a tough few weeks in which dairy farmers marched cows through its stores in protest at low prices they were being paid for milk.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/13/value-uk-milk-sales-plummet-pressure-mounts-dairy-farmers\">Asda pledged last week to raise the amount it paid farmers per litre to 28p</a>. But Clarke said on Tuesday that it would not promise to pay farmers <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/06/dairy-farmers-call-for-supermarkets-boycott-as-milk-price-falls\">a minimum based on the cost of production in the same way as Tesco or Sainsbury\u2019s</a>. He said Asda\u2019s deal with the Arla milk processing group, which is owned by farmers, gave them the best overall deal on milk and other dairy products such as cheese and yoghurt. </p> <p>Until the last fortnight, Arla was paying farmers one of the lowest prices in the market.</p> <h2>Rival opens new front in price war</h2> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s is opening a new front in the price war with Asda by taking its Brand Match promotion online.</p> <p>The scheme promises money-off vouchers if shoppers could have bought goods cheaper at Asda, as long as they put at least 10 items in their basket.</p> <p>The supermarket has been running the scheme in stores for four years after it was originally dreamt up by Mike Coupe, now the chief executive. Initially it matched prices against both Tesco and Asda but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/25/sainsburys-asda-brand-match-tesco-price-war\">Tesco was excluded from the scheme last September</a>.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s said it was taking the Brand Match online because of customer demand. Last year the supermarket chain issued more than 230m coupons under the scheme with more than half showing a comparable branded shop was cheaper at Sainsbury\u2019s compared with Asda.</p> <p>The supermarket is also likely to be hoping to boost the pace of sales growth. Sainsbury\u2019s online sales rose just 7% in the year to March compared with an 11.5% rise in online grocery sales at Tesco and 19.6% at Asda last year.</p> <p>The supermarket also recently launched its clothing brand Tu online across the country.</p>",

    "webTitle": "UK inflation has increased \u2013 but don't bank on a rate rise just yet", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England says interest rates are going up. Not quite yet, but at some time in the not too distant future, the monetary policy committee thinks the conditions will be right for borrowing costs to go up. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has made it clear that the timing of that decision will depend on what the economic data looks like. Unsurprisingly, therefore, every piece of news is seen as having a bearing on whether interest rates will go up in late 2015, early 2016 or later. The latest cost of living figures were slightly stronger than the City had been expecting. Headline annual inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, was 0.1% in July, up from 0.0% in June. Core inflation, which strips out volatile items such as food and energy, rose from 0.8% to 1.2%. Predictably, this was seen as bringing the date of a rate rise closer, and because higher interest rates tend to act as a magnet for global hot-money flows, the pound rose on the foreign exchanges. This, however, was a knee-jerk reaction. The inflation figures tell us next to nothing about when interest rates are going to go up, for the following reasons. First, the pickup in CPI inflation was almost entirely due to the timing of the summer sales for clothes and shoes. Shops such as Next and Clarks always cut prices in July, but this year the fall was smaller than in 2014. The reason for that was that some of the discounting was brought forward to June.

The cost of crude is down 20% on its level at the end of June, and while this has made it cheaper for motorists to fill up at the pumps, the reductions came too late to be included in the June data.

Sterling\u2019s trade-weighted index \u2013 the pound\u2019s value against a basket of currencies \u2013 is up 6% since the start of the year, and this makes imports cheaper. Manufacturers are already benefiting from the combined impact of a stronger pound and weaker commodity prices: the cost of their fuel and raw materials fell 0.9% in July. Inflation will pick up this year as last year\u2019s big falls in oil prices cease to have a downward impact on the annual rate, but it will remain well below the government\u2019s 2% target. The trigger for a rate rise is far more likely to be evidence of a an acceleration in wage growth.",

A pilot scheme by operator c2c, which runs trains between London and Essex, will begin early next year where passengers will receive a refund on their smartcards of 3p a minute if their train is late by more than two minutes and up to 29 minutes. A DfT spokesman said it would review the c2c scheme with the possibility of using it in future rail franchises. \u201cFrom this summer, compensation can be in cash if your train is delayed,\u201d Perry wrote. \u201cWe are making progress on part-time season tickets and the rollout of smart ticketing will deliver flexibility and the potential for automated compensation systems.\u201d In 2010 rail fares fell by 0.4% after the previous July\u2019s rate of RPI inflation was -1.4%, because fare rises were based on RPI plus 1%. Since 2011 annual fare rises have been between 2.5% and 6%. The TUC has claimed that season tickets could be 10% cheaper by 2017 if routes coming up for tender were given to public sector organisations. The campaign group Railfuture said the cost of rail still continued to rise. \u201cPeople\u2019s incomes are virtually stagnant, but because the government insists on using RPI instead of CPI (Consumer Price Index), rail fares will go up by about 1%,\u201d spokesman Bruce Williamson said.",

    "webTitle": "Nationwide chief criticises bank levy changes as unfair on smaller lenders", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Nationwide has criticised changes to the banking levy announced in the budget, saying that the scale-back will have a \u201cdisproportionate effect\u201d on smaller lenders and would cost the customer-owned group \u00a3300m over five years. The UK\u2019s largest building society reported an increase in pre-tax profit of almost 50% for the first quarter of its financial year \u2013 from \u00a3253m last year to \u00a3379m for the three months from April and June. Graham Beale said in a results statement that changes to the bank levy announced by the UK\u2019s chancellor, George Osborne, last month failed to recognise the contribution building societies had played in lending. Responding to complaints from banks that the levy has been raised too often and without warning, Osborne set out a timetable of reductions from 0.21% to 0.18% from January 2016 and 0.17% from January 2017, before reaching 0.10% from January 2021. The levy had been based on global balance sheets, but would from 2021 be focused only on their UK operations. The chancellor\u2019s move to scale back the levy, which has raised \u00a38bn since 2010, came alongside a new 8% surcharge on bank profits. Analysts estimated the changes would save major international banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered almost \u00a31bn in tax a year. \u201cThe proposed changes to the bank levy and introduction of the tax surcharge on banking companies announced in last month\u2019s budget may benefit UK headquartered international banks but will have a disproportionate effect on building societies such as Nationwide,\u201d Beale said. \u201cThis represents a missed opportunity to support diversity by acknowledging that building societies are different to banks and to recognise the contribution Nationwide and other mutuals make by lending to the UK economy, and the housing market in particular.\u201d The building society said that the impact of the changes to the banking levy and the introduction of a tax surcharge announced in the budget will cost \u00a3300m over the next five years. \u201cThis is equivalent to the capital required to support about \u00a310bn of lending,\u201d a statement said. Nationwide is the latest lender to hit out at the government\u2019s new banking surcharge, with Yorkshire Building Society and challenger banks such as TSB among those to have criticised the move. \u201cWe continued to lend through the financial crisis \u2013 we didn\u2019t take any losses or draw on taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d Beale said. He stressed the financial impact of the bank tax changes will not impact the group\u2019s ability to lend. Beale said customer-owned lenders such as Nationwide should be treated differently to banks because they are less of a risk to the British economy. \u201cInstead of having a surcharge of 8% for the large mutuals, to acknowledge that we\u2019re different with a different risk profile, it could have been 4%,\u201d he said. Changes to the banking levy came after sustained lobbying from the industry. HSBC\u2019s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said in May the \u00a3700m it paid towards the bank levy was impeding his efforts to bolster returns to shareholders. Nationwide provided more than a quarter of total net lending to the British housing market during the first quarter of its financial year, with gross mortgage lending rising by 17% to \u00a36.8bn. It said its share of the current account market remained at 6.8%, despite benefiting from the new current account switching service, gaining 7.4% of switchers.",

HSBC\u2019s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said in May <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/05/hsbc-to-decide-this-year-on-moving-its-hq-from-uk\">the \u00a3700m it paid towards the bank levy was impeding his efforts to bolster returns to shareholders</a>. </p> <p>Nationwide provided more than a quarter of total net lending to the British housing market during the first quarter of its financial year, with gross mortgage lending rising by 17% to \u00a36.8bn.<br></p> <p>It said its share of the current account market remained at 6.8%, despite benefiting from the new current account switching service, gaining 7.4% of switchers. <br></p>",

Sooner or later taxi drivers will be fretting over self-driving cars. The battle between man and machines goes back centuries. Are they taking our jobs? Or are they merely easing our workload? A study by economists at the consultancy Deloitte seeks to shed new light on the relationship between jobs and the rise of technology by trawling through census data for England and Wales going back to 1871. Their conclusion is unremittingly cheerful: rather than destroying jobs, technology has been a \u201cgreat job-creating machine\u201d. Findings by Deloitte such as a fourfold rise in bar staff since the 1950s or a surge in the number of hairdressers this century suggest to the authors that technology has increased spending power, therefore creating new demand and new jobs. Their study, shortlisted for the Society of Business Economists\u2019 Rybczynski prize, argues that the debate has been skewed towards the job-destroying effects of technological change, which are more easily observed than than its creative aspects. Going back over past jobs figures paints a more balanced picture, say authors Ian Stewart, Debapratim De and Alex Cole. \u201cThe dominant trend is of contracting employment in agriculture and manufacturing being more than offset by rapid growth in the caring, creative, technology and business services sectors,\u201d they write. \u201cMachines will take on more repetitive and laborious tasks, but seem no closer to eliminating the need for human labour than at any time in the last 150 years.\u201d Here are the study\u2019s main findings: Hard, dangerous and dull jobs have declined In some sectors, technology has quite clearly cost jobs, but Stewart and his colleagues question whether they are really jobs we would want to hold on to. Technology directly substitutes human muscle power and, in so doing, raises productivity and shrinks employment. \u201cIn the UK the first sector to feel this effect on any scale was agriculture,\u201d says the study. In 1871, 6.6% of the workforce of England and Wales were classified as agricultural labourers. Today that has fallen to 0.2%, a 95% decline in numbers. The census data also provide an insight into the impact on jobs in a once-large, but now almost forgotten, sector. In 1901, in a population in England and Wales of 32.5 million, 200,000 people were engaged in washing clothes. By 2011, with a population of 56.1 million just 35,000 people worked in the sector. \u201cA collision of technologies, indoor plumbing, electricity and the affordable automatic washing machine have all but put paid to large laundries and the drudgery of hand-washing,\u201d says the report. \u2018Caring\u2019 jobs have risen The report cites a \u201cprofound shift\u201d, with labour switching from its historic role, as a source of raw power, to the care, education and provision of services to others. It found a 909% rise in nursing auxiliaries and assistants over the last two decades. Analysis of the UK Labour Force Survey from the Office for National Statistics suggest the number of these workers soared from 29,743 to 300,201 between 1992 and 2014. In the same period there was also a 580% increase in teaching and educational support assistants 183% increase in welfare, housing, youth and community workers 168% increase in care workers and home carers On the other hand, there was a 79% drop in weavers and knitters from 24,009 to 4,961 57% drop in typists 50% drop in company secretaries Technology has boosted jobs in knowledge-intensive sectors In some sectors \u2013 including medicine, education and professional services \u2013 technology has raised productivity and employment has risen at the same time, says the report. \u201cEasy access to information and the accelerating pace of communication have revolutionised most knowledge-based industries,\u201d say the authors. At the same time, rising incomes have raised demand for professional services. For example, the 1871 census records that there were 9,832 accountants in England and Wales and that has risen twentyfold in the last 140 years to 215,678. Technology has shifted consumption to more luxuries Technological progress has cut the prices of essentials, such as food, and the price of bigger household items such as TVs and kitchen appliances. The real price of cars in the UK has halved in the last 25 years, notes Stewart. That leaves more money to spend on leisure, and creates new demand and new jobs, perhaps explaining the big rise in bar staff, he adds. \u201cDespite the decline in the traditional pub, census data shows that the number of people employed in bars rose fourfold between 1951 and 2011,\u201d the report says. ... and left more money for grooming Concluding that \u201cthe stock of work in the economy is not fixed\u201d, the report cites the surge in hairdressers as evidence that where one avenue closes in the jobs market, others open. The Deloitte economists believe that rising incomes have allowed consumers to spend more on personal services, such as grooming. That in turn has driven employment of hairdressers. So while in 1871, there was one hairdresser or barber for every 1,793 citizens of England and Wales; today there is one for every 287 people.",

      "bodyText": "The global economy is on course for muted growth this year and next as it faces risks from a slowdown in China, the prospect of higher interest rates in the US and the lingering threat of a Greek exit from the euro, according to the latest forecasts from Moody\u2019s. Outlining the list of potential shocks that could knock even modest expansion off course, the credit rating agency said it did not expect the world\u2019s leading economies to shake off the legacy of the financial crisis and return to their former growth averages for the next five years. Moody\u2019s forecasts GDP growth for the G20 to slow to 2.7% this year, down from 2.9% in 2014. The agency is expecting only a slight pickup to 3% growth in 2016, according to its latest quarterly global outlook, which feeds into its ratings on countries\u2019 sovereign debts. \u201cThe recovery in the US and, to a lesser extent, the euro area and Japan, will be offset by the ongoing slowdown in China, low or negative growth in Latin America and only a gradual Russian recovery from its recession this year,\u201d said the report\u2019s author, Marie Diron. \u201cA sharp or long-lasting correction in asset prices in China is one of the risk factors which could result in lower G20 growth than in our baseline forecasts.\u201d Moody\u2019s said UK growth appeared \u201crobust and broad-based\u201d although it forecast a slowing pace from 2.7% expansion this year to 2.4% in 2016. It said the Bank of England may starting raising interest rates gradually from early next year, as long as a recent pickup in wage growth is maintained. The latest official figures, however, showed UK earnings growth either stalled or fell, depending on the measure used. The agency used its quarterly update to revise down its oil price forecasts following the sharp falls in recent months and continuing signs that supply continues to outpace demand. Moody\u2019s now expects Brent crude to average $57 (\u00a337) a barrel in 2016, only a little higher than the 2015 average of $55. The price of the North Sea benchmark has more than halved from its peak price of $115 a barrel last summer, trading at $49 on Monday. Moody\u2019s warning over threats to the outlook from China follows sharp falls on the country\u2019s stock markets last month as officials in Beijing brought in emergency measures to stabilise prices and shore up confidence in the world\u2019s second biggest economy. China\u2019s surprise currency devaluation last week only served to heighten fears about the state of its economy and the potential impact on the rest of the world. In the biggest one-off devaluation of its currency in two decades the country\u2019s central bank allowed the yuan, also called the renminbi, to weaken by nearly 2% in a day. That was followed by two successive days of further markdowns in the value of the currency. \u201cThe recent depreciation of the renminbi has added concerns about what it may portend for China\u2019s economic growth,\u201d said Diron. Moody\u2019s forecasts that the official measure of Chinese growth will slow from 7.4% last year to 6.8% this year and 6.5% in 2016, falling towards 6% in subsequent years. The ratings agency also highlighted risks to the global economy from \u201ca disorderly response\u201d to the anticipated rise in US interest rates. \u201cThe Federal Reserve has stated its intention to raise interest rates from later this year. However, future prices currently imply an expectation that rate increases may start later and proceed at a slower pace than implied by its open market committee\u2019s projections. This gap presents a risk,\u201d said Diron. The US central bank has paved the way for its first increase in the cost of borrowing in nine years to come as soon as next month. That prospect has fanned fears of renewed volatility in emerging economies\u2019 currency, bond, and stock markets as money floods out of them. If a rate rise does cause a shock in financial markets, Moody\u2019s said Turkey and South Africa are among the more vulnerable countries. In the eurozone the threat of Greece leaving the single currency has receded but not gone away, the ratings agency warned. Although Athens has clinched a new \u20ac86bn (\u00a360bn) bailout package, Moody\u2019s has forecast a \u201csharp recession\u201d in Greece, as \u201ccapital controls, heightened risk of exit from the euro area in June and July and now lack of visibility about the policy and economic environment put spending on hold\u201d. For the eurozone as a whole, Moody\u2019s forecast economic growth to rise from 0.9% last year to about 1.5% this year and next, helped by lower oil prices and a weaker euro. But there was as yet no evidence that structural reforms had significantly lifted the region\u2019s growth potential, Diron said in her report. The cautious eurozone outlook follows similar comments from rival ratings agency Fitch on Monday that the single currency bloc\u2019s \u201cmedium-term growth prospects are generally weak\u201d. Responding to figures last week showing eurozone GDP growth slowed to 0.3% in the second quarter, from 0.4% in the first, Fitch said the news was still consistent with its view that the eurozone\u2019s short-term economic outlook had improved. But it believes high debt and structural weaknesses will weigh on the recovery. Fitch is forecasting eurozone economic growth of about 1.6% annually between 2015-2017.",
