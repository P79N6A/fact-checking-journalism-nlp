      "bodyText": "Tsipras ends the session by repeating that Greece is close to a deal. And the stakes couldn\u2019t be much higher: A quick update. Alexis Tsipras is wrapping up events in the Greek parliament now. He\u2019s telling MPs that his government are committed to ending a \u201cfailed programme\u201d, and feels he has parliament\u2019s support. He also cited a letter in today\u2019s FT from a group of leading economists, who called for \u201csanity and humanity\u201d to be shown to Greece (we pasted it in the blog this morning). We are not alone, Tsipras says. This parliamentary debate is going to rumble on for some time, but I think we\u2019ve got the key points now. Over to my colleague Heather Stewart to round up the situation: The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has warned that time is running out to rescue Greece from the brink of bankruptcy and exit from the eurozone, ensuring that his country\u2019s plight will be a pressing concern for G7 leaders as they gather in Bavaria. With the end of June now regarded as the last possible moment for striking a deal to release the \u20ac7.2bn in bailout funds that Greece needs to stay afloat, Tsipras struck a defiant tone in a statement before the country\u2019s parliament, accusing Greece\u2019s creditors of making \u201cabsurd\u201d demands on his recession-hit country and insisting, \u201cthey won\u2019t humiliate us\u201d. Tsipras also appealed to the Greek opposition parties \u2013 and his own Syriza MPs \u2013 to back his negotiating stance and reject the latest proposals from the country\u2019s paymasters. \u201cTime is not only running out for us, it is running out for everyone,\u201d he warned, adding: \u201cGreek people should be proud because the government is not going to give into absurd proposals.\u201d He also insisted that a debt restructuring \u2013 writing off some of the \u20ac320bn that Greece owes \u2013 must remain on the table. US officials, including the Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, have repeatedly warned their European counterparts not to be complacent about the economic risks of a so-called \u201cGrexit\u201d, and President Obama is likely to reinforce that argument this weekend. The US president is likely to be particularly concerned that Greece could turn to Russia for aid. Tsipras underlined that risk on Friday by letting it be known he was holding a phone conversation with president Putin. In the Greek parliament, Antonis Samaras, leader of the opposition New Democracy party, accused Tsipras of mishandling the negotiations and tipping Greece back into recession. \u201cYou have totally destroyed the country and isolated us,\u201d he said..... More here: And unless anything major happens tonight, we\u2019re finished for the week. Thanks, and have good weekends all. GW Tsipras has also reiterated that he won\u2019t accept an offer that doesn\u2019t include debt relief for Greece -- a key demand, but one which creditors have been reluctant to embrace. The Greek PM has also just denied that a deal must be reached within 10 days, as one opposition leader suggested tonight: Our multimedia team have just launched a video clip of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s speech to the Athens parliament this evening, complete with subtitles: Alexis Tsipras is now speaking in parliament again, responding to the various opposition leaders\u2019 speeches over the last hour. The Greek PM insists that his government will never sign a new \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d (a reference to the austerity programme Greece accepted in 2012). He is also pushing the opposition parties to choose between his proposals, and those of the creditors... Bloomberg has a good take on Alexis Tsipras\u2019s speech; focusing on his call for creditors to take back their \u2018absurd\u2019 demands: Tsipras Asks Greece\u2019s Creditors to Withdraw Latest Proposal Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras asked Greece\u2019s international creditors to withdraw their conditions for giving more money in a defiant address to parliament. \u201cThe proposals from the creditors are clearly unrealistic,\u201d Tsipras told lawmakers in Athens late Friday. \u201cThe Greek government cannot consent to unreasonable proposals that call for devastating measures for pensioners and Greek families. I want to believe that it was a bad negotiating trick.\u201d The embattled Greek leader went on the attack after telling German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande on Thursday that a list of proposals set by creditors to unlock bailout funds can\u2019t be the basis for a deal. German and French officials declined to comment on the contents of the call. The latest proposal was an \u201cunpleasant surprise,\u201d Tsipras said, adding that voters are asking the government \u201cnot to succumb to the irrational, blackmailing demands of our creditors.\u201d....More here There\u2019s a troubling inconsistency at the heart of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s speech tonight. On the one hand, he emphatically rejects the proposals from Greece\u2019s creditors (he rejects pension cuts, VAT rises on electricity, penurious budget targets) Minutes later, he\u2019s pledging that a deal is closer than ever before. But he\u2019s not about to cave in. And it\u2019s not obvious that the IMF, ECB and EC are going to suddenly fold either. So how can a deal happen? Pasok leader Venizelos reminds MPs that Greece will need a third bailout once its current programme expires in June: Four years ago this month, Evangelos Venizelos was Greece\u2019s new finance minister, as part of the left-wing Pasok administration which asked for Greece\u2019s first bailout. Tonight, he\u2019s giving perhaps his final major speech as Pasok\u2019s leader, having seen their support slump at the last election. Venizelos criticises prime minister Tsipras for turning up tonight and asking for opposition parties to back him, rather than turning up with an actual deal. He also questions whether Tsipras actually understands the responsibilities of being prime minister, at such a vital, troubled time in Greece\u2019s history. While the debate rumbles on, new opinion polling shows that Alexis Tsipras\u2019s party Syriza remains the most popular party in Greece, well ahead of New Democracy. Party leaders continue to address the parliament. Panagiotis Kammenos, the leader of the right-wing \u2018Independent Greeks\u2019 party (junior partner in the coalition government) played down the importance of delaying today\u2019s payment to the IMF. He also pledged to support Tsipras until a good agreement has been reached. What happens next? Well, for all Tsipras\u2019s defiance tonight, there\u2019s no suggestion that the two sides will stop talking. Instead, negotiations could (and should) intensify. G7 leaders are meeting in Germany this weekend -- Tsipras won\u2019t be there, but we can probably expect president Obama to push Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande and Jean-Claude Juncker to sort this crisis out. America remains very anxious that the eurozone crisis is going to blow up; memories of 2008 and the collapse of Lehman Brothers are still raw in Washington (and rightly so, those were scary days) The FT reckons that talks between Greece and its creditors could start early next week: Eurozone officials said talks could resume as early as Tuesday, when Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, returns to Brussels from the Group of Seven meeting in Germany and Mr Tsipras is due to join his EU counterparts for a summit with Latin American leaders. The head of the extreme right-wing Golden Dawn party had an alarming message for Greece tonight: Fresh from being released from his \u201ccell of honour,\u201d Nicholaos Michaloliakos told MPs (those who hadn\u2019t walked out in disgust) that his party firmly opposes the old bailout deal. \u201cPerhaps the love affair with Europe is over?\u201d he mused. \u201cFor five years we have lived the memorandum and look what it has achieved. Our party is firmly against the memorandum.\u201d Is Golden Dawn lying in wait - readying itself for Syriza to fail with its enforced embraced of austerity? Michaloliakos tonight, with his forebodingly friendly demeanour, proved once again that it is. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 first take on Alexis Tsipras\u2019s eagerly-awaited speech, for anyone just tuning in: Greek PM says cannot accept \u201cabsurd\u201d proposal from lenders Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Friday branded a cash for reforms proposal by his country\u2019s creditors an \u201cabsurd\u201d one that he cannot accept and said he hoped it would be taken back. In an uncompromising speech to parliament, Tsipras said a proposal by Athens made earlier this week was the only realistic basis for a deal with creditors. \u201cThe proposals submitted by lenders are unrealistic,\u201d Tsipras said. \u201cThe Greek government cannot consent to absurd proposals.\u201d Nevertheless, Greece is closer to a deal than ever before since Athens\u2019 proposal is not indifferent to the needs of the creditors, he said. The leader of the Potami party, Stavros Theodorakis, gave a typically moderate speech in response to Alexis Tsipras\u2019s defiant address. Theodorakis says Tsipras should rein in members of his Syriza party from calling for a \u2018rupture\u2019 from lenders, or Greece\u2019s exit from the euro. More reaction to Tsipras\u2019s speech: Peter Spiegel, Brussels bureau chief of the Financial Times, suggests it may have alarmed the European Central Bank, which decides next week whether to keep supporting Greece\u2019s banks...and on what terms. But Ed Conway, Sky News economics editor, believes it was mostly posturing. A deal is still possible. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s defiant speech may make it harder to reach a deal, warns financial expert Nick Spiro, of Spiro Sovereign Strategy: BBC economics editor Robert Peston questions whether a breakthrough is really close: Tsipras can\u2019t expect the opposition to back him until he has actually reached an agreement, argues Simon Nixon of the Wall Street Journal: While Nick Malkoutzis of Greece\u2019s Kathimerini newspaper liked the speech, but questions its impact: Nikos Michaloliakos, the leader of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, now has the floor. Yes, a man who is being tried over charges of running a criminal organisation, alongside his fellow MPs. And that\u2019s because Golden Dawn, notorious for its virulent views on immigration and gay rights, came third in January\u2019s general elections. Many MPs have exited the chamber. The main opposition leader Antonis Samaras is now criticising Alexis Tsipras fiercely in his response to tonight\u2019s speech. The former PM says: \u201cYou have totally destroyed the country and isolated us,\u201d He also questions whether a deal is imminent, and claims Tsipras\u2019s mishandling of the situation means creditors are demanding more than in 2014, undoing his government\u2019s hard work. And Samaras warns his left-wing rival that he risks leading Greece to a grisly fate. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras gave one of his finer speeches tonight: eloquent in its sparseness, biting in a low-key punchy way. The aim clearly was to keep pessimism at bay (perhaps the biggest enemy when it comes to Greece\u2019s fragile banking system) and to win endorsement from the political opposition for the government\u2019s rejection of the creditor\u2019s \u201cshock\u201d proposal this week - crucial to the national unity that he now wants to present to the EU and IMF. But the leftwing prime minister also risks being exposed by his own transparency: that the drama we have seen in recent days - from refusing to meet today\u2019s IMF payment to rejecting the proposal made by lenders - is just another bargaining ploy. What did we learn from Alexis Tsipras\u2019s speech to the Athens parliament (highlights start here)? 1) He is not caving into the IMF, ECB and EC, even as time continues to run short to reach agreement before Greece\u2019s bailout ends on June 30. Tsipras says he will not accept the \u201cabsurd\u201d demands from lenders. Indeed, he hopes they will take them back. \u201cThe proposals submitted by lenders are unrealistic,\u201d \u201cThe Greek government cannot consent to absurd proposals.\u201d 2) Greece is sticking to its \u2018red lines\u2019. It wants a deal that offers debt relief, low primary surpluses, protection for pensioners, brings back collective wage bargaining, and redistributes income from rich to poor. 3) Despite this firm line, Tsipras insists that a deal is imminent (but for that to happen, someone needs to compromise, and he says it\u2019s not him) 4) Tsipras pledges that Greece will remain in the euro; but creditors must compromise so that fears of Grexit are ended. 5) He has challenged \u201cAll parties\u201d in the Greek parliament to support his efforts. New Democracy\u2019s leader, Antonis Samaras, is now responding. He says Tsipras has \u201csome nerve\u201d to challenge opposition parties to back him. Samaras (who was prime minister until January) also criticises Tsipras\u2019s handling of the economy. Anything you have gained through negotiations has been lost by Greece\u2019s fall back into recession. That felt like a classic Tsipras speech -- defiant, critical of Greece\u2019s creditors, but still with the promise of a brighter future soon. It also included a possible trap for the opposition: will they support him, and bolster his hand, or oppose him, and risk losing public support at this crucial time? And Tsipras starts to wrap up, saying his first priority is to get low budget surplus targets. And then he ends his speech with this call to arms: \u201cWe want a deal that is economically viable and socially just.\u201d \u201cThis is time of responsibility for all\u201d . And finally.... Greek people should be proud because the government is not going to give into absurd proposals. Some instant reaction: Why is a deal close? Because we have international public support for our \u201crealistic plans\u201d and because no-one wants a \u201crupture\u201d, Tsipras says. Hand on heart, Tsipras says, I believe we are on the verge of a deal.... MPs applaud Alexis Tsipras has he pledges that Greece will not be humiliated by its lenders He\u2019s getting more emotive now, talking about financial \u2018strangulation\u2019 Tsipras is calling on the opposition MPs to step up and say clearly whether they also reject the proposals which creditors want Greece to swallow. The Greek prime minister is getting into the meat of his speech. \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves,\u201d he tells parliament tonight. \u201cThe crucial point of these negotiations is not just the reforms being asked of us but stopping the self-perpetuating vicious cycle of [recession].\u201d That, in a nutshell, is why Tsipras\u2019 radical left Syriza\u2019s party was catapulted into power in January. \u201cWhat we need is not just an agreement but a solution that will stop discussions about Greece\u2019s exit of the euro zone .... that will stop this uncertainty,\u201d he tells the 300-seat House. Some would argue, of course, that the posturing seen in recent months has not helped the Greek economy either. Tsipras then puts the boot in -- creditors proposals are unrealistic and \u201cabsurd\u201d: GREEK PM SAYS LENDERS\u2019 PROPOSAL ARE UNREALISTIC AND BACKTRACK FROM COMMON GROUND WE\u2019VE FOUND IN RECENT MONTHS GREEK PM SAYS GREEK GOVT CAN IN NO WAY AGREE TO ABSURD PROPOSALS Now the Greek PM is criticising the proposals made by Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday night (the five-page document is online here) Tsipras says he was \u201cnegatively surprised\u201d by what Juncker put on the table, and never believed that creditors could think that Greece\u2019s parliament could scrap pensioners benefits, or impose higher taxes on electricity. Another key point -- Tsipras is telling parliament that Greece needs an end to austerity, complete with debt relief. As predicted, Tsipras is saying that Greece\u2019s proposals is the \u201conly realistic plan\u201d on the table. Tsipras\u2019s key theme so far is that \u201cGreece needs a solution, not just an agreement, otherwise it will never exit the long crisis\u201d. And that agreement must put an end to speculation that we might leave the euro. Tsipras is now arguing that Greece has already compromised, taking on board the progress made in Brussels in recent weeks. Oh sorry, BBC World have gone to the Weather! Here\u2019s your live feed in English: It\u2019s a pretty serious start from Tsipras. He says his government has proved its \u201ccommitment to the European ideal\u201d by presenting comprehensive proposals to lenders Tsipras is telling MPs that he is determined to reach a solution to deliver \u201ca new epoch for the European Union\u201d. BBC World are carrying Tsipras\u2019s speech with an English translation, if you can get it in your area... You\u2019re welcome, World. Tsipras insists that he has nothing to hide from the people., We are seeking a European solution, for all of Europe as well as Greece. Alexis Tsipras takes the stand (tieless, so we know that a deal hasn\u2019t suddenly been reached behind closed doors). He tells MPs that he called tonight\u2019s session because the people, and all political parties, need to know the situation - and importantly \u2018where we want to go\u2019. We are in the \u2018final stretch\u2019 of negotiations, he says. The Athens parliament is pretty full. We can see Yanis Varoufakis on the ministerial benches, and New Democracy leader Antosis Samaras in front of his block of MPs. And we\u2019re off! Parliament is in session, with speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou outlining tonight\u2019s debate, starting with the speech by Alexis Tsipras... The delay is giving analysts and commentators time to speculate on what Alexis Tsipras might tell MPs: Some new polling data just hit the Reuters terminal, showing a majority of Greeks support the government\u2019s strategy. But more than a third think they should defy creditors: 05-Jun-2015 16:48:23 - GREEK POLL SHOWS 60% OF GREEKS BACK GOVERNMENT\u2019S NEGOTIATING STRATEGY WITH LENDERS 05-Jun-2015 16:49:34 - 47% OF GREEKS SAY GOVT SHOULD ACCEPT LENDERS\u2019 PROPOSAL, 35% BELIEVE IT SHOULDN\u2019T - OPINION POLL There\u2019s quite a Germanic theme to the music being played on the Greek parliament channel..... Across the eurozone, Ireland just had its credit rating raised from A to A+ by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. S&amp;P credited Ireland\u2019s improved fiscal performance, state asset sales and robust economic performance since its bailout programme began in 2011. More resolute words from another government minister: We just got a good hint of what Tsipras will say tonight. His office just released an extremely punchy statement, laying into the creditors\u2019 \u201cextreme positions\u201d, and blasting them for their failure to compromise. He then pledges that an acceptable agreement would not include any new cuts to wages or pensions, and would include debt relief. Sound like he\u2019s holding his ground. Firmly Events seem to be running a little late in Athens; currently, a \u201chigh-spirited\u201d committee meeting is taking place, complete with some full and frank exchanges of views..... Quite entertaining. Tonight\u2019s session could take a while - as Greece\u2019s opposition leaders get to respond to Tsipras, and vice versa... Fighting talk from Greece\u2019s finance minister -- he\u2019s told Newsnight\u2019s team in Athens that the offer made by the creditors is \u201catrocious\u201d, and suggests they don\u2019t want an agreement at all. Nearly time for the big event of the evening - Alexis Tsipras\u2019s speech to the Athens parliament. The Greek PM is due to start speaking at 6.30pm local time, or 4.30pm BST. It\u2019s his first public appearance since his government dramatically raised the stakes against its creditors by withholding today\u2019s \u20ac300m repayment to the IMF. I believe it will be streamed live here. We\u2019ll cover the key points and reaction in the liveblog. As my colleague Helena explained earlier, Tsipras has three goals: to address his own MPs; many in Syriza are apoplectic at the demands the EU, ECB and IMF are now making of Greece, and a section of the party support default and leaving the euro; to inform the nation of the state of negotiations to tackle the political opposition head on over the stance Greece has taken to its lenders\u2019 latest offer. As we wait for Alexis Tsipras and the other party leaders to begin speaking in the Greek parliament, there is another potentially important player in the drama. Channel 4\u2019s Paul Mason explains: Zoe Konstantopoulou, the speaker of parliament, is technically there to chair proceedings. But while Tsipras, Yanis Varoufakis and their negotiators have been trying to get the country\u2019s debt reduced via the IMF and ECB, Ms Konstantopoulou has been working to get it declared invalid. Ms Konstantopoulou\u2019s debt truth committee, set to report on 18 June, is said to be on the point of finding some of Greece\u2019s original bailout debt, from either 2010 or 2011, was unlawfully contracted. In addition, Ms Konstantopoulou is armed with a finding from experts that Germany owes Greece \u20ac350bn in war reparations \u2013 more than the whole of its debt to Europe. As I\u2019ve said before, those who think the debt truth and reparations processes in Greece are \u201cfor show\u201d are mistaken. Ms Konstantopoulou is piling up, effectively, a mega legal claim amounting to hundreds of billions that would be lodged in Europe\u2019s various international courts. In recent days her efforts have been boosted by a finding by a United Nations expert on human rights that Greeks\u2019 \u201ceconomic and social rights\u201d had been undermined by the IMF/EU imposed austerity. Full piece here: Greece: will Alexis Tsipras waive a writ at Europe? Not surprisingly, with the uncertainty over Greece\u2019s future in the eurozone growing following its plan to delay paying the IMF, the country\u2019s banks are taking a hit. With the Athens general composite index now down 4.96%, most of the big fallers are financial shares. Pireaus Bank is down nearly 14%, National Bank of Greece is off nearly 11% and Alpha Bank is down 9.6%. Greece\u2019s creditors are trying to make the country sign up to a programme which has already proved to be a failure, argues economist Joseph Stiglitz in a Project Syndicate piece for the Guardian: EU leaders continue to play a game of brinkmanship with the Greek government. Athens has met its creditors\u2019 demands more than halfway. Yet Germany and Greece\u2019s other creditors continue to demand that the country sign on to a programme proven to be a failure, and that few economists ever thought could, would, or should be implemented. The swing in Greece\u2019s fiscal position from a large primary deficit to a surplus was almost unprecedented, but the demand that the country achieve a primary surplus of 4.5% of GDP was unconscionable. Unfortunately, at the time that the \u201ctroika\u201d \u2013 the European commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 first included this irresponsible demand in the international financial programme for Greece, the country\u2019s authorities had no choice but to accede to it. The folly of continuing to pursue this programme is particularly acute, given the 25% decline in GDP that Greece has endured since the beginning of the crisis. The troika badly misjudged the macroeconomic effects of the programme they imposed. According to their published forecasts, they believed that, by cutting wages and accepting other austerity measures, Greek exports would increase and the economy would quickly return to growth. They also believed that the first debt restructuring would lead to debt sustainability. The troika\u2019s forecasts have been wrong, and repeatedly so. And not by a little, but by an enormous amount. Greece\u2019s voters were right to demand a change in course, and their government is right to refuse to sign on to a deeply flawed programme. And he concludes: Europe\u2019s leaders viewed themselves as visionaries when they created the euro. They thought they were looking beyond the short-term demands that usually preoccupy political leaders. Unfortunately, their understanding of economics fell short of their ambition; and the politics of the moment did not permit the creation of the institutional framework that might have enabled the euro to work as intended. Although the single currency was supposed to bring unprecedented prosperity, it is difficult to detect a significant positive effect for the eurozone as a whole in the period before the crisis. In the period since, the adverse effects have been enormous. The future of Europe and the euro depends on whether the eurozone\u2019s political leaders can combine a modicum of economic understanding with a visionary sense of, and concern for, European solidarity. We are likely to begin finding out the answer to that existential question in the next few weeks. The full piece is here: A quick update on the markets. Wall Street is lower in early trading following the better than expected non-farm payroll numbers - which hint at a possible rise in US interest rates later this year - but it is off its worst levels. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 11 points or 0.06%, which has helped the UK market recover some ground. The FTSE 100 is down 41.19 points at 6818.05 having fallen as low as 6785 on concerns about the financial crisis in Greece. The Athens market is still under pressure, down 4.8% and other European markets have also fallen again, with Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.92%. Oil is also volatile despite Opec deciding to keep production levels unchanged. Ratings agencies were not expected to designate the delay in Greece making its IMF payment which was due today as a default, and so Fitch has just confirmed. But the agency says the move to postpone the \u20ac300m payment highlights \u201cthe extreme pressure on government funding.\u201d It does not, however, have direct implications for Greece\u2019s CCC sovereign rating. Fitch said: Fitch\u2019s ratings reflect the risk of default to private rather than official sector creditors, so delaying repayment to the IMF is not in and of itself a ratings default. Nevertheless, bundling this month\u2019s repayments illustrates the pressure that a lack of market or official funding and tight liquidity conditions for Greek banks are putting on Greece\u2019s sovereign liquidity. Our CCC sovereign rating, affirmed last month, indicates that default on privately held bonds is a real possibility. The risk that Greece misses its larger IMF payment at end-June cannot be discounted. The prospect of fiscal disbursements from Greece\u2019s official creditors is highly uncertain. The Greek government has not accepted the proposals presented by the institutions (the European Commission, European Central Bank, and IMF) this week. If the two sides do agree a deal, it will meet political opposition from elements of Syriza most hostile to the institutions\u2019 proposals for pensions and public sector wages. Time constraints mean we expect that an agreement would take the form of a further extension of Greece\u2019s existing programme beyond end-June and partial disbursements, conditional on Greece demonstrating its commitment to its terms. These funds would primarily be used to meet redemptions, which will rise sharply in July and August as bonds held by the Eurosystem fall due, as well as enabling Greece to fund a small ongoing deficit. Missing the larger end-June payment to the IMF would be credit negative. If no outline agreement between Greece and the institutions were in place, it would increase the risk that the ECB restricts Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) to Greek banks. This may ultimately lead to restrictions on the banking sector to reduce liquidity strains, including capital controls. The risk of capital controls is reflected in our B- country ceiling for Greece, which is just one notch above the sovereign issuer default rating. Back to Greece, and a report from Russia\u2019s Itar Tass news agency on the earlier phone conversation between Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and Russian president Vladimir Putin: [The two leaders] have discussed bilateral energy cooperation and Greece\u2019s possible participation in the BRICS [development] bank by telephone on Friday. \u201cGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Russian President Vladimir Putin have discussed energy cooperation between the two countries and the Greek prime minister\u2019s participation in the forthcoming Economic Forum in St. Petersburg on June 18-20 as well as Greece\u2019s cooperation with the BRICS bank. The telephone conversation passed in a friendly atmosphere,\u201d the Greekgovernment said. \u201cThe president and the prime minister discussed practical steps to implement agreements reached during the recent visit of Alexis Tsipras to Russia and the planned construction of gas transportation infrastructure via the territories of Turkey and Greece,\u201d the Kremlin press service reported earlier on Friday. \u201cThe two leaders agreed to meet at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum on June 18-20,\u201d the Kremlin press service said. The US Federal Reserve could raise rates in July or September, reckons Rob Carnell of ING Bank in the wake of the better than expected non-farm payroll numbers. He said: Just when all the Fed speakers were sounding more and more cautious, in comes a strong labour market report and puts thoughts of tighter policy back on the agenda. The headline non-farm payrolls gain was 280,000, higher than the 226,000 consensus (ING forecast 240,000), and comes with some nice upward revisions to previous month\u2019s data (up 32,000) that make this an even better looking number. There was an unexpectedly good wages growth number too, with 0.3% month on month growth in hourly wages taking wage inflation for the year up to 2.3% year on year, which it last touched briefly in August 2013, and then again for one month in July 2011. Other than these brief spikes, wages growth has not been 2.3% or above since 2009. With the pool of available labour having shrunk in each of the last four months, we may now have the conditions in place for a sustained, though modest uptrend in wages growth. We are not too bothered by the tick up in the unemployment rate to 5.5%. This owes more to a 397,000 rise in the labour force, which lifted the numbers of unemployed by 125,000. But this distorts what is clearly a positive picture, and we think it will be swiftly reversed in coming months. The broad measure of unemployment (U6) remained unchanged at 10.8%. Taking all of this together, it remains difficult to see the Fed changing rates in June \u2013 they have almost already ruled it out in the May FOMC minutes and elsewhere, and we think we need to see the labour market data supported with other non-labour activity improvements first. But assuming that these are forthcoming, a third quarter 2015 rate hike still looks a decent bet, and could be either July or September. We don\u2019t think the FOMC will be substantially moved by recent comments by the IMF\u2019s Christine Lagarde, namely that rate hikes would be better left until 2016. The Fed sets monetary policy for the US, not for the rest of the world. The stronger than expected non-farm numbers is also hitting the bond markets: The higher non-farm numbers of course mean that people are immediately speculating that this gives the US Federal Reserve more fuel to raise interest rates this year (despite what the IMF advised on Thursday). So the dollar has climbed, with sterling falling a cent to $1.522. The full report from the Bureau of Labour Statistics is here. Away from Greece, and there are better than expected US non-farm payroll numbers. Analysts had been looking for a rise of 225,000 in May, but the figure has come in at 280,000. April has been revised up from 221,000 to 223,000 and March from 95,000 to 119,000 Some sobering lunchtime viewing: an insight into the impact of Greece\u2019s financial crisis on its people, from Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway and Emily Purser. Well worth watching, especially if you\u2019re trying to get an insight into Greece from abroad (those of you reading in Greece already know the picture better than me, of course) The FT\u2019s also has a good story about Greece\u2019s debt restructuring hopes, which I shamefully failed to plug early this mornig. This is a crucial part of Athens\u2019 plan for a comprehensive debt deal, but there\u2019s no mention of it in the latest demands from creditors. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel has seen the document, and explains: The restructuring plan is ambitious, offering ways to reduce the amount of debt held by all four of its public-sector creditors: the European Central Bank, which holds \u20ac27bn in Greek bonds purchased starting in 2010; the International Monetary Fund, which is owed about \u20ac20bn from bailout loans; individual eurozone member states, which banded together to make \u20ac53bn bilateral loans to Athens as part of its first bailout; and the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, which picks up the EU\u2019s \u20ac144bn in the current programme. If all the elements of the new plan are adopted, the Greek government reckons its debt will be back under 60 per cent of GDP \u2013 the eurozone\u2019s ceiling agreed under the 1992 Maastricht Treaty \u2013 by 2030, as this chart from the document shows: It\u2019s certainly an ambitious proposal to deal with Greece\u2019s debt mountain (although some of the ideas have been proposed before) It includes perpetual bonds (ie, debt that produces an income but is not repaid), and GDP-bonds (where the interest rate is pegged to Greece\u2019s recovery). It also involves eliminating a chunk of Greece\u2019s bailout debt, in return for doubling the interest rate on another chunk. That write-off would cut Greece\u2019s debt burden, and is thus politically unpalatable to much of Europe. But without such a radical plan, can Greece ever get its debts down to sustainable levels? Although Greece has bought itself some time, it now faces a mountain of financial demands from 30th June to mid-July: A group of eminent economists from across the world have written a joint letter in the Financial Times today, pleading with Greece\u2019s creditors to provide \u201chope not despair\u201d. The list includes Nobel prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, star French economist Thomas Piketty, former Italian PM Massimo D\u2019Alema, and America\u2019s Jamie Galbraith. (generally a pro-Keynesian crowd) And the letter has also been released by the office of Euclid Tsakalotos, the British-educated economist coordinating Greece\u2019s negotiations, for the benefit of Greeks who don\u2019t take the FT. Here\u2019s the full letter: In the final hour, a plea for economic sanity and humanity Sir, The future of the EU is at stake in the negotiations between Greece and its creditor institutions, now close to a climax. To avoid failure, concessions will be needed from both sides. From the EU, forbearance and finance to promote structural reform and economic recovery, and to preserve the integrity of the Eurozone. From Greece, credible commitment to show that, while it is against austerity, it is in favour of reform and wants to play a positive role in the EU. In a letter to the FT in January, several of us said: \u201cWe believe it is important to distinguish austerity from reforms; to condemn austerity does not entail being anti-reform.\u201d Six months on, we are dismayed that austerity is undermining Syriza\u2019s key reforms, on which EU leaders should surely have been collaborating with the Greek government: most notably to overcome tax evasion and corruption. Austerity drastically reduces revenue from tax reform, and restricts the space for change to make public administration accountable and socially efficient. And the constant concessions required by the government mean that Syriza is in danger of losing political support and thus its ability to carry out a reform programme that will bring Greece out of the crisis. It is wrong to ask Greece to commit itself to an old programme that has demonstrably failed, been rejected by Greek voters, and which large numbers of economists (including ourselves) believe was misguided from the start. Clearly a revised, longer-term agreement with the creditor institutions is necessary: otherwise default is inevitable, imposing great risks on the economies of Europe and the world, and even for the European project that the eurozone was supposed to strengthen. Syriza is the only hope for legitimacy in Greece. Failure to reach a compromise would undermine democracy in and result in much more radical and dysfunctional challenges, fundamentally hostile to the EU. Consider, on the other hand, a rapid move to a positive programme for recovery in Greece (and in the EU as a whole), using the massive financial strength of the Eurozone to promote investment, rescuing young Europeans from mass unemployment with measures that would increase employment today and growth in the future. This could both transform the economic performance of the EU and make it once more a source of pride for European citizens. How Greece is treated will send a message to all its eurozone partners. Like the Marshall plan, let it be one of hope not despair. So, how many countries have actually failed to repay the International Monetary Fund on time? My colleague Alberto Nardelli has the answer - 32 countries have fallen at least six months into arrears with their IMF bills, from Cuba in 1959 to Zimbabwe in 2001. And it has usually been prompted by a very serious crisis: What is evident browsing through this list, from Cuba and Cambodia to Sudan and Yugoslavia, is that many of the countries that are on it were characterised primarily by domestic or regional violence, if not by outright war, during the years in question. Solidarity in Brussels. The European Commission has just defended Greece\u2019s decision to defer today\u2019s IMF repayment until the end of June. Top EC spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters that the move was in line with the Fund\u2019s rules, and has happened before (just once though!). It would be wrong to make \u201cvalue judgements\u201d about the move, Schinas insisted. Why might Alexis Tsipras want to discuss energy issues with Vladimir Putin, at this crucial time? Our own Helena Smith has the answer..... On the issue of energy, the country\u2019s energy minister Panagiots Lafazanis (who also happens to be the third most important man in the cabinet and head of Syriza\u2019s hardline faction, the Left Platform) has been making some very testy remarks recently. Last night he announced that Athens would \u201cnot take orders from anyone\u201d after Washington made clear its displeasure at the government\u2019s declared aim to allow the construction of a pipeline carrying Russian natural gas in northern Greece. This morning he racheted up the pressure further saying: \u201cGreece will not be blackmailed over its energy choices.\u201d An unrepentant Marxist, Lafazanis has been in overdrive since the leftist-led government assumed power, to cement good ties with Moscow. The FT\u2019s Athens correspondent, Kerin Hope, agree, saying: Talking to Mr Putin would also likely reassure the hard leftists in Mr Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party who are balking at the notion of a new agreement involving pension cuts and higher VAT. The German finance ministry has just revealed that Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has asked to meet with his counterpart in Berlin, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, on Tuesday. Spokesman Martin Jaeger just told reporters that: \u201cWe\u2019re looking into it...There\u2019s been a request (from Greece) for a meeting but we haven\u2019t been able to find a time yet. We\u2019ll let you know on Monday.\u201d A Greek government official has confirmed that Tsipras will speak with Putin, in around 15 minutes, according to this Reuters newsflash: GREEK PM TSIPRAS WILL HOLD TELEPHONE TALKS WITH RUSSIA\u2019S PUTIN AT 1000 GMT TO DISCUSS ENERGY ISSUES - GOVT OFFICIAL That\u2019s 1pm Greek time, or 11am BST. \u201cEnergy issues\u201d could refer to a plan to build a Russian gas pipeline through Greece, which could yield an advance payment to Athens. Greek worries are keeping Europe\u2019s stock markets in the red, but it\u2019s not a major selloff: Investors are waiting to see Alexis Tsipras\u2019s next move. Rabobank strategists say: \u201cWith uncertainty about Greece repaying or not repaying the IMF today out of the way ... markets may focus on the political fall-out from this decision.\u201d And Royal Bank of Scotland reckons Greeks could soon be heading back to the polling booths (as minister Dimitris Stratoulis suggested this morning). Greece\u2019s Mega TV is reporting that Alexis Tsipras is planning to speak with Russian president Vladimir Putin today: We\u2019re looking into it..... Western politicians have been fretting that Greece could turn to Moscow to help with its financial plight, at a time when Russia is barred from this weekend\u2019s gathering of world leaders at the G7 summit. Brussels insiders have backed up economy minister George Stathakis\u2019s claim that the International Monetary Fund suggested bundling Greece\u2019s June repayments into a single bill. They\u2019ve told the Guardian that the IMF proposed the option but didn\u2019t receive a reply - before learning last night that this bargaining chip had been played. A senior EU official has just insisted that the Greece crisis will not be on the agenda at the G7 summit on June 7th and 8th in Schloss Elmau, Germany. Officially, the leaders of Germany, France, the UK, US, Japan, Canada, Italy and the European Union will discuss the global economy, along with foreign, security and development policies. Other issues will include \u201cProtection of the marine environment\u201d, antibiotics and the Ebola outbreak, and energy security. But European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has just admitted that the Greek crisis will \u201cpreoccupy him\u201d this weekend. He\u2019ll be at Schloss Elmau along with European Council president Donald Tusk. At one stage yesterday, we thought Alexis Tsipras would meet Juncker in Brussels today. That\u2019s been superseded by the debate in parliament tonight. Over in Athens, there is mounting anticipation over the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 speech before parliament tonight, reports Helena Smith. This will be the second time that the radical left leader has addressed the 300-seat parliament since assuming power in January. And as Popi Tsapanidou, who anchors Star TV\u2019s popular morning news show, told the nation: \u201cAnd all of us are going to be glued to our screens,\u201d Will he or won\u2019t he? That is the question. Will Tsipras call a vote of confidence (aides say he won\u2019t)? Will he call fresh elections? (possible but unlikely) Will he reveal that Athens is in fact closer than ever before to cutting a deal with its creditors that would tide the country over the summer - as the German press is intimating this morning? Analysts believe that the anti-austerity prime minister will have three goals: to address his own party, Syriza, whose politicians are said to be apoplectic at the demands the EU, ECB and IMF are now making of Greece; to inform the nation of the state of negotiations to tackle the political opposition head on over its stance re lenders\u2019 latest offer. Paula Bolla, a political reporter with SKAI News, explain: \u201cWhat he wants to show is that the entire Greek parliament is opposed to the proposal, that\u2019s the message he wants to send lenders.\u201d The leader\u2019s speech will begin at 6:30PM (4.30pm BST), and will be followed by that of other political leaders. Many are expecting a dramatic night of debate. The Athens stock market has fallen by over 3% in early trading. Financial shares are among the big fallers, with Piraeus Bank, National Bank of Greece and Eurobank all shedding at least 5%. Greek government bonds are tumbling in value this morning. Investors are rushing to sell, following the decision to delay today\u2019s \u20ac300m IMF repayment. That is driving up the yield, or interest rate, on Greek debt, as this chart shows: Here\u2019s another key quote from Greek economy minister George Stathakis on the Today Programme this morning: \u201cWe are looking forward to getting a deal as soon as possible. The Greek government cannot accept these new proposals put on the table.\u201d Theodoros Fessas, the president of The Association of Greek Industries, is also speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme. He says the demands being made by Greece\u2019s creditors are \u201cquite high\u201d, and contain \u201charsh\u201d measures. The key to reviving Greece\u2019s fortunes is to improve its tax system, Fessas insists. All the past governments have not been efficient or effective at collecting taxes. And that means the burden on those who pay taxes is rising higher and higher, he argues. Today Programme: What happens if Greece cannot get its way with creditors? Would you compromise, or leave the euro? We do not have a mandate to leave the eurozone, economy minister George Stathakis replies. He explains that Syriza campaigned on a platform of getting a new deal with creditors, within the single currency. George Stathakis says: We have a mandate from the Greek people to go on, to try to change the terms of the agreement. Greece has to remain in the euro, otherwise we do not have any mandate to take action. George Stathakis says that the Greek government is not prepared to accept the proposals tabled by its creditors this week (when Alexis Tsipras met Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels on Monday night). He cites the primary surplus targets which lenders are pushing for (including a 1% primary surplus this year; Greece believes only 0.6% is achievable). Greece\u2019s economy minister, George Stathakis, is now on the Today Programme. Why has Greece chosen to delay its IMF repayment? Stathakis: There was an offer already on the table from the IMF, so I think the government chose to accept this offer and repay at the end of the month. So you\u2019re suggesting it\u2019s the IMF\u2019s idea? Stathakis: It was on the table, more or less. Even in the previous instalment there was the idea of paying through our funds at the IMF, rather than draining Greece\u2019s resources. So you have the money, but you chose not to? That is correct. Are you sending a signal to your creditors? And why? Stathakis explains that the Greek economy is paying all its debt through internal resources since last June, it has not received a single euro since. He says Greece needs a deal soon, but a sustainable deal on its terms. The BBC\u2019s European Editor, Katya Adler, has also heard that Greece had the money to repay the IMF today, but chose not to (as our Helena Smith reported last night). Adler is telling the Today Programme now that the delayed repayment is being seen as a political jesture: It is being seen as Greece saying to the international creditors, don\u2019t push us, we\u2019d rather snap than bend. As feared, Europe\u2019s stock markets are being hit by Greek worries. The FTSE 100 has dropped by 35 points at the start of trading, to 6824, which I think is a one-month low. More to follow..... Greece\u2019s economy minister, George Stathakis, is about to discuss the situation on Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme. You can hear it live here. Despite the turmoil of recent years, most Greeks still want to remain in the eurozone: We\u2019re not sure what the \u201cother\u201d option would be.... Greece\u2019s deputy social security minister, Dimitris Stratoulis, has warned that early elections could be called unless its lenders soften their demands. Stratoulis said this morning: \u201cThe lenders want to impose hard measures. If they do not back down from this package of blackmail the government ... will have to seek alternative solutions, elections\u201d. A new opinion poll this morning shows that 45% of Greeks want their government to cut a deal, even if it means making concessions. But 37% would prefer an election instead. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s Syriza party has held a substantial lead in opinion polls over New Democracy (ND), suggesting that it would be returned to power. But such an election probably couldn\u2019t be held until early July - after Greece\u2019s bailout extension expires (and after it is due to pay a total of \u20ac1.6bn to the IMF) Good morning. The Greek crisis is coming towards the boil today, following Athens\u2019 unexpected decision not to pay the International Monetary Fund a \u20ac300m repayment due today. By delaying that payment up until the end of June, Greece\u2019s government has drawn up new battle lines with its creditors, and fuelled fears over the country\u2019s grip on eurozone membership. As we wrote last night: Greece has moved closer to default and possible exit from the eurozone after telling the International Monetary Fund it would not be making a debt repayment of \u20ac300m (\u00a3219m) due on Friday. A crisis that has been going on for more than five years entered a new phase when Athens surprised the IMF by saying it intended to bundle up four payments in June totalling \u20ac1.6bn and make them all at the end of the month. The move came as the Greek government reacted angrily to what was seen as an ultimatum from its creditors \u2013 including the IMF \u2013 that demanded further austerity and unpopular reforms to VAT, pensions and wage bargaining as the price for \u20ac7.2bn in fresh financial help. The Financial Times calls the move \u201ca sign of the country\u2019s defiance\u201d against the demands being made by Greece\u2019s creditors in return for ending the months of deadlock over its bailout. According to our sources at the Bank of Greece, Greece could have found the money to repay the IMF today, but not to hand it over. One well-placed insider told our Helena Smith last night: \u201cWe have enough for the payment but Tsipras wants to save up for salaries and pensions.\u201d The Greek government is also waiting to hear Christine Lagarde\u2019s response to their decision; only hours after she told reporters she was confident the money would show up. As our insider put it: \u201cShe\u2019s annoyed that we reassured her earlier and was taken by surprise. \u201cThe Bank, however still expects a positive reply tomorrow.\u201d Good luck with that..... So how will things develop today? Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is due to speak in parliament at 6pm local time, or 4pm BST. He\u2019ll update MPs on the state of play in negotiations with creditors. Last night, Tsipras told German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Francois Hollande that lenders were making unacceptable demands on Greece. Athens is expected to submit new proposals of its own soon, in a bid to get a deal before its bailout expires at the end of June. European stock markets are expected to dip today, as the Greek crisis dominates the financial world. Stan Shamu of IG explains: While optimism had been growing that progress had been made in negotiations between Greece and its creditors, it\u2019s clear there is still a long way to go and some of that optimism might have been a little unfounded. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

Athens has met its creditors\u2019 demands more than halfway. Yet Germany and Greece\u2019s other creditors continue to demand that the country sign on to a programme proven to be a failure, and that few economists ever thought could, would, or should be implemented.</p> <p>The swing in Greece\u2019s fiscal position from a large primary deficit to a surplus was almost unprecedented, but the demand that the country achieve a primary surplus of 4.5% of GDP was unconscionable. Unfortunately, at the time that the \u201ctroika\u201d \u2013 the European commission, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank\">European Central Bank</a> and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 first included this irresponsible demand in the international financial programme for Greece, the country\u2019s authorities had no choice but to accede to it.</p> <p>The folly of continuing to pursue this programme is particularly acute, given the 25% decline in GDP that Greece has endured since the beginning of the crisis. The troika badly misjudged the macroeconomic effects of the programme they imposed. <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2013&amp;ey=2020&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=174&amp;s=NGDP_RPCH&amp;grp=0&amp;a=&amp;pr.x=79&amp;pr.y=11\">According to their published forecasts</a>, they believed that, by cutting wages and accepting other austerity measures, Greek exports would increase and the economy would quickly return to growth. They also believed that the first debt restructuring would lead to debt sustainability.</p> <p>The troika\u2019s forecasts have been wrong, and repeatedly so. And not by a little, but by an enormous amount. Greece\u2019s voters were right to demand a change in course, and their government is right to refuse to sign on to a deeply flawed programme.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Europe\u2019s leaders viewed themselves as visionaries when they created the euro. They thought they were looking beyond the short-term demands that usually preoccupy political leaders.</p> <p>Unfortunately, their understanding of economics fell short of their ambition; and the politics of the moment did not permit the creation of the institutional framework that might have enabled the euro to work as intended. Although the single currency was supposed to bring unprecedented prosperity, it is difficult to detect a significant positive effect for the eurozone as a whole in the period before the crisis. In the period since, the adverse effects have been enormous.</p> <p>The future of Europe and the euro depends on whether the eurozone\u2019s political leaders can combine a modicum of economic understanding with a visionary sense of, and concern for, European solidarity. We are likely to begin finding out the answer to that existential question in the next few weeks.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full piece is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/05/greeces-creditors-need-a-dose-of-reality-this-is-no-time-for-european-disunion\">Greece's creditors need a dose of reality \u2013 this is no time for European disunion</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5571ae8de4b019d982cba237\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-05T14:21:32.612Z\">3.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A quick update on the markets.</strong></p> <p>Wall Street is lower in early trading following the better than expected non-farm payroll numbers - which hint at a possible rise in US interest rates later this year - but it is off its worst levels.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 11 points or 0.06%, which has helped the UK market recover some ground.

Fitch said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fitch\u2019s ratings reflect the risk of default to private rather than official sector creditors, so delaying repayment to the IMF is not in and of itself a ratings default. Nevertheless, bundling this month\u2019s repayments illustrates the pressure that a lack of market or official funding and tight liquidity conditions for Greek banks are putting on Greece\u2019s sovereign liquidity. Our CCC sovereign rating, affirmed last month, indicates that default on privately held bonds is a real possibility.</p> <p>The risk that Greece misses its larger IMF payment at end-June cannot be discounted. The prospect of fiscal disbursements from Greece\u2019s official creditors is highly uncertain. The Greek government has not accepted the proposals presented by the institutions (the European Commission, European Central Bank, and IMF) this week. If the two sides do agree a deal, it will meet political opposition from elements of Syriza most hostile to the institutions\u2019 proposals for pensions and public sector wages.</p> <p>Time constraints mean we expect that an agreement would take the form of a further extension of Greece\u2019s existing programme beyond end-June and partial disbursements, conditional on Greece demonstrating its commitment to its terms. These funds would primarily be used to meet redemptions, which will rise sharply in July and August as bonds held by the Eurosystem fall due, as well as enabling Greece to fund a small ongoing deficit.</p> <p>Missing the larger end-June payment to the IMF would be credit negative. If no outline agreement between Greece and the institutions were in place, it would increase the risk that the ECB restricts Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) to Greek banks. This may ultimately lead to restrictions on the banking sector to reduce liquidity strains, including capital controls. The risk of capital controls is reflected in our B- country ceiling for Greece, which is just one notch above the sovereign issuer default rating.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-06-05T13:29:54.077Z\">at 2.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55719e53e4b0f3282588b525\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-06-05T13:09:17.913Z\">2.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tsipras and Putin to meet in Russia this month</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back to Greece, and a report from Russia\u2019s Itar Tass news agency on the earlier phone conversation between Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and Russian president Vladimir Putin</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The two leaders] have discussed bilateral energy cooperation and Greece\u2019s possible participation in the BRICS [development] bank by telephone on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Russian President Vladimir Putin have discussed energy cooperation between the two countries and the Greek prime minister\u2019s participation in the forthcoming Economic Forum in St. Petersburg on June 18-20 as well as Greece\u2019s cooperation with the BRICS bank.

(<em>generally a pro-Keynesian crowd</em>)</strong></p> <p>And the letter has also been released by the office of Euclid Tsakalotos, the British-educated economist coordinating Greece\u2019s negotiations, for the benefit of Greeks who don\u2019t take the FT. </p> <p>Here\u2019s the full letter:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a8e1e728-0b05-11e5-98d3-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz3cBDwNlJa\">In the final hour, a plea for economic sanity and humanity</a></h2> <p>Sir, The future of the EU is at stake in the negotiations between Greece and its creditor institutions, now close to a climax. To avoid failure, concessions will be needed from both sides. From the EU, forbearance and finance to promote structural reform and economic recovery, and to preserve the integrity of the Eurozone. From Greece, credible commitment to show that, while it is against austerity, it is in favour of reform and wants to play a positive role in the EU.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/639cf9b0-a1a0-11e4-bd03-00144feab7de.html\">a letter to the FT in January</a>, several of us said: \u201cWe believe it is important to distinguish austerity from reforms; to condemn austerity does not entail being anti-reform.\u201d Six months on, we are dismayed that austerity is <em>undermining </em>Syriza\u2019s key reforms, on which EU leaders should surely have been collaborating with the Greek government: most notably to overcome tax evasion and corruption. Austerity drastically reduces revenue from tax reform, and restricts the space for change to make public administration accountable and socially efficient. And the constant concessions required by the government mean that Syriza is in danger of losing political support and thus its ability to carry out a reform programme that will bring Greece out of the crisis. It is wrong to ask Greece to commit itself to an old programme that has demonstrably failed, been rejected by Greek voters, and which large numbers of economists (including ourselves) believe was misguided from the start.</p> <p>Clearly a revised, longer-term agreement with the creditor institutions is necessary: otherwise default is inevitable, imposing great risks on the economies of Europe and the world, and even for the European project that the eurozone was supposed to strengthen.</p> <p>Syriza is the only hope for legitimacy in Greece. Failure to reach a compromise would undermine democracy in and result in much more radical and dysfunctional challenges, fundamentally hostile to the EU.</p> <p>Consider, on the other hand, a rapid move to a positive programme for recovery in Greece (and in the EU as a whole), using the massive financial strength of the Eurozone to promote investment, rescuing young Europeans from mass unemployment with measures that would increase employment today and growth in the future. This could both transform the economic performance of the EU and make it once more a source of pride for European citizens.</p> <p>How Greece is treated will send a message to all its eurozone partners. Like the Marshall plan, let it be one of hope not despair.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YiannisMouzakis/statuses/606762017588973569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;How <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> is treated will send a message to all its eurozone partners&quot;.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Last spring, when one US dollar got you a paltry \u20ac0.72, Americans visiting to Paris needed to fork out $17 for a \u20ac12 entrance ticket to the permanent collections of the Louvre. Today the same ticket will set them back barely $13. Likewise, a reasonable three-star hotel in Rome: perhaps $350 last year, more like $275 this. Or three courses for two \u2013 plus a few beers \u2013 in one of an Amsterdam eetcafe: about $100 just 18 months ago but $75 now. \u201cEurope feels like it\u2019s on sale this year for Americans,\u201d said Barrie Seidenberg, CEO of Viator, a US-based company that allows tourists to pre-book entrance tickets to the big attractions and small-group \u201cjump the queue\u201d tours before leaving home. As the euro currency sinks ever closer to parity with the dollar, the fact that a European vacation is now about 25% cheaper than it was last year has not escaped the attention of US holidaymakers. Although for some of the old world\u2019s more popular attractions, that could cause problems. Over the last bank holiday weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported, the Palace of Versailles \u2013 despite recently investing \u20ac15m to revamp its entrance hall \u2013 was forced to post a message on its website asking tourists not already armed with an advance ticket to postpone their visit, or at least to confine it to the gardens. Versailles, the resplendent centre of French royal power until the 1789 revolution, drew more than 7.5 million visitors to its palace and gardens in 2013. But even that was comfortably exceeded by the world\u2019s busiest museum, the Louvre, which is expecting to welcome well over 9 million people this year. Seidenberg said searches and bookings on the company\u2019s site for attractions like the Louvre and the Sistine Chapel in Rome were up by 60%, while advance sales for the Eiffel Tower had soared by 170% this year. \u201cParis is on fire,\u201d she said. \u201cBut really any place in Europe that people feel is iconic, that they have to see, and especially any place they fear there might be queues ... Much as people want to see the Sistine Chapel, they don\u2019t want to queue for five hours in the Roman sun first.\u201d Savvier American visitors have already learned that advance booking is now essential. \u201cWe planned it all online months ago from the US,\u201d said Cindy Sohn, who is from southern California and visiting Paris with friends. \u201cWe spent two weekends meeting up over a bottle of wine deciding what to do, then I spent a day on museum websites booking everything for scheduled time slots.\u201d Add to the surging US influx the growing number of Asian (particularly Chinese) holidaymakers eager to tour Europe\u2019s most famous attractions, and it is hard to see how the visitor experience at many of Europe\u2019s more venerable \u2013 and overcrowded \u2013 landmarks is not going to suffer. Some tourists plainly have a miserable enough time already. \u201cThe lines are total chaos with little help from the staff and I couldn\u2019t really advance purchase in this case: the website is terrible,\u201d a recent US visitor to the Eiffel Tower wrote on the travel site Tripadvisor. Another agreed: \u201cLines were crazy, people trying to get you to buy things everywhere, trapping you and begging.\u201d Of the Louvre, one Las Vegas tourist recorded that despite going late in the day, \u201cIt\u2019s chaotic and a madhouse inside. It\u2019s very disorganised too, even if you have the map.\u201d A visitor from Virginia said the museum was \u201ctotal and utter chaos\u201d and that to see its main draw, the Mona Lisa, visitors should expect to \u201cfight your way through a frenzied crowd pushing and shoving just to get a glimpse of it.\u201d According to Atout France, the French tourism development agency, a record 3.2 million US tourists visited the country in 2014, encouraged by the euro\u2019s gradual weakening over the course of the year. The number is expected to increase further this year. Anne-Laure Tuncer, director of the agency\u2019s New York bureau, said early indications were that reservations for some categories of flights to France from the US were up by as much as 7% this April compared with last year. \u201cIt\u2019s an indication of the way things are going,\u201d she said. Tuncer added that a recent Gallup poll showed 82% of Americans had a broadly favourable image of France and the strong dollar-euro exchange rate was \u201ca real bonus\u201d. The impact should be felt not just in increased tourist numbers, she said, but \u201cin upgrades \u2013 people tend to book more excursions, for example, or a better class of hotel. They\u2019re easier with their money.\u201d In Venice, Florida-based tour organisers Randall and Dorothy Smith said their business had done well this year because the trips it runs, booked a year in advance with prices locked down in euros, are paid for only 30 days before they begin. \u201cThis year has been a banner year,\u201d Randall said. \u201cThere\u2019s money to be made.\u201d For tourist attractions, there is also money to be spent. The Louvre is currently in the throes of a major \u00a340m renovation programme aimed at helping it handle up to 14 million visitors a year \u2013 more than three times the number it was getting at the turn of the century. According to the museum, up to 40,000 people a day now jostle to see the Mona Lisa alone \u2013 funnelled towards it by a visitor flow system redesigned last year specifically to reflect the fact that, for many visitors to the Louvre, the enigmatic smile is all they really want to see. In Amsterdam, the celebrated Rijksmuseum reopened last year after a monumental \u00a3275m revamp that should allow it to cope with up to 5 million visitors a year. Along with several other major museums, it is also considering extending its hours (the Louvre, currently closed on Tuesdays, is thinking about staying open seven days a week). In Rome, the Sistine Chapel, expected to pull in 6 million visitors this year, is now staying open until nearly midnight one day a week. Even attractions outside city centres are also noticing a rise in US visitors. The Fondation Claude Monet, which runs the impressionist\u2019s house and garden in Giverny, west of Paris, saw 625,000 visitors in the seven months it was open last year, 20% of them from America. \u201cThis year, the number of US visitors has already risen \u2013 and it\u2019s around 27% of our total so far,\u201d a spokesman said. Italy Just outside of Giolitti, one of the oldest gelaterias in Rome and a top tourist attraction, students Navi Atwal and Julia Spencer, both from California, admitted it was the favourable exchange rate that encouraged them to travel in Italy after their study abroad programme in Spain ended for the year. Spencer said she fully realised just how much the weakened euro helped her finances while she was studying in Spain: her monthly rent in euros stayed the same, but the dollar cheques she was receiving from her parents were buying her more and more. \u201cI would feel like I had more money by the end of the month \u2013 $50 to $70 a month,\u201d she says. \u201cComing here, I knew I had to be really careful with my money. But then later, as the price went down, I could be a little more flexible,\u201d she said. Tennessee newlyweds Kevin Maggard and Sharmaine Hunt say they did not come to Italy especially because of the exchange rate, but noted that lots of people at home had mentioned to them that it was a \u201cgood time to go. You feel like you can spend a little more money,\u201d Hunt said. On their first day in the Eternal City prices at lunch seemed \u201creasonable\u201d and they calculated that an \u20ac8 dish would only set them back about $10 In Venice, Pam Sammartino, from Denver, Colorado, said the exchange rate had definitely helped her budget, allowing her to stay at a nicer hotel \u2013 one with a pool \u2013 than she otherwise would have. But Franco, a gondolier, said whatever the exchange rate, people were spending less money than they used to. The day of long lunches and gondola rides have been replaced by take-out pizza by the slice and public transport, he said. France Like hundreds of others, Scott Sohn, a building contractor from southern California and his wife, Cindy, had been queuing for over half an hour to climb the bell tower of Notre Dame Cathedral. \u201cWe got here well before opening time to stand in line because in the afternoon the line is twice as long,\u201d he said. The Sohns and their fellow holidaymakers, the Phillipses from Palm Springs, are seasoned travellers from previous trips spent fighting the crowds in Rome. They had seen scores of pre-planned sights from the Normandy D-day beaches to their special queue-jumping pass and guide at the Louvre. \u201cThere were such crowds in front of the Mona Lisa that you had to push and shove to get close,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cIf I was a first time visitor from the US and I went there on my own, I\u2019m not sure what kind of impression I\u2019d have. There\u2019s a lot of pushing and a lot of tight corners,\u201d Cohn said. At the Louvre, the crowd in front of the Mona Lisa is now almost as famous as the painting. \u201cI took a photo of people taking photos of the Mona Lisa,\u201d said Jon Gabrielson, a major in English and history. Further back in the queue, Rachel Tierney, an English major from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, said the impressionists at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay had proved tricky due to the wall of people taking selfies in front of the works of Degas. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t see anything, we were 30 feet away from the pantings.\u201d Maggie Finch, an English major in the same group of friends, had been \u201cvery surprised\u201d in London to have to queue for half an hour to get a picture of platform nine and three quarters at Kings Cross station. Likewise, Paris\u2019s recently restored gothic chapel La Sainte-Chapelle was stunning \u201cbut if you turned around you bumped into other tourists\u201d. Most felt the queues in Paris were small-fry compared to Italy. \u201cRome was far worse,\u201d sighed a pensioner from Texas waiting to get into Notre Dame.",

They\u2019re easier with their money.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4caace2def14f3f15a406e5a7d77df7f3a4fd62c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/5/1433530027376/482b3d5b-bdfe-4201-8962-31ab001112dc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sistine Chapel\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rome\u2019s Sistine Chapel now stays open until nearly midnight for one day each week to help deal with its 6 million visitors a year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Musei Vaticani/Ansa/Claudio Peri/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Venice, Florida-based tour organisers Randall and Dorothy Smith said their business had done well this year because the trips it runs, booked a year in advance with prices locked down in euros, are paid for only 30 days before they begin. \u201cThis year has been a banner year,\u201d Randall said. \u201cThere\u2019s money to be made.\u201d</p> <p>For tourist attractions, there is also money to be spent. The Louvre is currently in the throes of a major \u00a340m renovation programme aimed at helping it handle up to 14 million visitors a year \u2013 more than three times the number it was getting at the turn of the century. <br></p> <p>According to the museum, up to 40,000 people a day now jostle to see the Mona Lisa alone \u2013 funnelled towards it by a visitor flow system redesigned last year specifically to reflect the fact that, for many visitors to the Louvre, the enigmatic smile is all they really want to see.</p> <p>In Amsterdam, the celebrated Rijksmuseum reopened last year after a monumental \u00a3275m revamp that should allow it to cope with up to 5 million visitors a year. Along with several other major museums, it is also considering extending its hours (the Louvre, currently closed on Tuesdays, is thinking about staying open seven days a week). <br></p> <p>In Rome, the Sistine Chapel, expected to pull in 6 million visitors this year, is now staying open until nearly midnight one day a week.</p> <p>Even attractions outside city centres are also noticing a rise in US visitors. The Fondation Claude Monet, which runs the impressionist\u2019s house and garden in Giverny, west of Paris, saw 625,000 visitors in the seven months it was open last year, 20% of them from America. \u201cThis year, the number of US visitors has already risen \u2013 and it\u2019s around 27% of our total so far,\u201d a spokesman said.<br></p> <h2>Italy</h2> <p>Just outside of Giolitti, one of the oldest gelaterias in Rome and a top tourist attraction, students Navi Atwal and Julia Spencer, both from California, admitted it was the favourable exchange rate that encouraged them to travel in Italy after their study abroad programme in Spain ended for the year.<br></p> <p>Spencer said she fully realised just how much the weakened euro helped her finances while she was studying in Spain: her monthly rent in euros stayed the same, but the dollar cheques she was receiving from her parents were buying her more and more.</p> <p>\u201cI would feel like I had more money by the end of the month \u2013 $50 to $70 a month,\u201d she says. \u201cComing here, I knew I had to be really careful with my money. But then later, as the price went down, I could be a little more flexible,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Tennessee newlyweds Kevin Maggard and Sharmaine Hunt say they did not come to Italy especially because of the exchange rate, but noted that lots of people at home had mentioned to them that it was a \u201cgood time to go. You feel like you can spend a little more money,\u201d Hunt said.</p> <p>On their first day in the Eternal City prices at lunch seemed \u201creasonable\u201d and they calculated that an \u20ac8 dish would only set them back about $10</p> <p>In Venice, Pam Sammartino, from Denver, Colorado, said the exchange rate had definitely helped her budget, allowing her to stay at a nicer hotel \u2013 one with a pool \u2013 than she otherwise would have.</p> <p>But Franco, a gondolier, said whatever the exchange rate, people were spending less money than they used to. The day of long lunches and gondola rides have been replaced by take-out pizza by the slice and public transport, he said.</p> <h2>France</h2> <p>Like hundreds of others, Scott Sohn, a building contractor from southern California and his wife, Cindy, had been queuing for over half an hour to climb the bell tower of Notre Dame Cathedral. \u201cWe got here well before opening time to stand in line because in the afternoon the line is twice as long,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The Sohns and their fellow holidaymakers, the Phillipses from Palm Springs, are seasoned travellers from previous trips spent fighting the crowds in Rome. They had seen scores of pre-planned sights from the Normandy D-day beaches to their special queue-jumping pass and guide at the Louvre. </p> <p>\u201cThere were such crowds in front of the Mona Lisa that you had to push and shove to get close,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cIf I was a first time visitor from the US and I went there on my own, I\u2019m not sure what kind of impression I\u2019d have. There\u2019s a lot of pushing and a lot of tight corners,\u201d Cohn said.</p> <p>At the Louvre, the crowd in front of the Mona Lisa is now almost as famous as the painting. \u201cI took a photo of people taking photos of the Mona Lisa,\u201d said Jon Gabrielson, a major in English and history. <br></p> <p>Further back in the queue, Rachel Tierney, an English major from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, said the impressionists at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay had proved tricky due to the wall of people taking selfies in front of the works of Degas. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t see anything, we were 30 feet away from the pantings.\u201d </p> <p>Maggie Finch, an English major in the same group of friends, had been \u201cvery surprised\u201d in London to have to queue for half an hour to get a picture of platform nine and three quarters at Kings Cross station. Likewise, Paris\u2019s recently restored gothic chapel La Sainte-Chapelle was stunning \u201cbut if you turned around you bumped into other tourists\u201d.</p> <p>Most felt the queues in Paris were small-fry compared to Italy. \u201cRome was far worse,\u201d sighed a pensioner from Texas waiting to get into Notre Dame.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The machines have finished, but the humans go on tunnelling. On Thursday, a landmark moment came when the final inches of Crossrail\u2019s train tunnels were dug by Victoria, one of eight 1,000-tonne monsters which spent the past three years reshaping London\u2019s underground pathways. But the completion of that massive, 26-mile dig is far from the end of a tunnelling boom in the capital and beyond. For many in the industry, it\u2019s a mark of pride that the construction work, metres under busy streets and houses, can pass unnoticed. A mile or two west of Farringdon, where the prime minister was underground to herald the tunnelling achievement, excavation continued in the heart of the West End. Below the shoppers of Oxford Street, weaving past the sovereign subsoil of the Tanzanian high commission and just above the ceiling of Central line trains, new tunnels linking the capital\u2019s new and old subterranean train tracks are being gouged out of the earth. This will be Bond Street\u2019s expanded underground station, growing to meet the demand created by a more frequent Jubilee line even before the anticipated passenger boom when the \u00a314.8bn Crossrail line connects here. Working in the city centre adds levels of complexity, and expense. Propertyinflates the bill massively: tens of millions of the \u00a3320m upgrade is spent on securing the space to do the work. To minimise the footprint, the building that will become a new station entrance doubles up as a five-floor storage and construction site, stacked with cranes, machinery and materials right up to the air conditioning system on the roof (pumping down air as fresh as can be found in the notoriously polluted Oxford Street). \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like threading the eye of a needle,\u201d says Miles Ashley, London Underground\u2019s programme director of Crossrail and stations. Work here goes on around the clock, with acoustic cladding to minimise noise nuisance for neighbours, who include African diplomats, flagship stores and high-end boutiques, and the great and good of the Oriental Club at the end of a short cul-de-sac where thousands of lorries have come to haul earth away. Meanwhile, the tunnels must negotiate Bazalgette\u2019s Victorian water mains and the mothballed Royal Mail underground railway line \u2013 not to mention a fully functioning tube station. After descending into the clay and adjusting to the subterranean world, dim and echoey between bouts of drilling, it is surreal to peek blinking into the light through an emergency door into the frenzy of rush hour escalators. That crowd is why they are digging: \u201cThere\u2019s no point in having 36 trains an hour if you can\u2019t get people off the platform before the next one,\u201d says Ashley. Where the state-of-the-art German-built tunnel boring machines made great drives forward on Crossrail\u2019s long train paths, some methods used in the small confines here are in essence as old as the original underground. Most of the enlarged Bond Street (and the majority of the eight miles of service tunnels and walkways Crossrail has also built) uses a relatively new technique, called spray concrete lining, to form the walls of the tunnels. It is one of the skills taught at a training academy in east London developed to provide the workforce for Crossrail and beyond. More than 8,000 people have been trained at the tunnelling and underground construction academy in Ilford, north-east London, since it opened in 2011. Valerie Todd, talent and resources director of Crossrail, says: \u201cWhen we started we were in the midst of a recession and we had the opportunity to recruit from a broad market, but found there weren\u2019t enough people with the right skills. That was the catalyst to build an academy to meet our own needs - but also to look ahead. Now the market is very much heating up, not only in major projects such as HS2, potentially Crossrail 2 or Thames Tideway, but the tube upgrades and road schemes.\u201d Those skills honed in the capital\u2019s clay depths will be in demand for other projects. The \u00a350bn HS2 high-speed rail network will build tunnels through much of London and the Chilterns, with more planned in Manchester for phase 2; the Northern line extension to Battersea has been given the go-ahead, while the proposed \u00a34.2bn Thames Tideway super-sewer would see another 16 miles of tunnelling around the capital. Linda Miller, a senior engineer with Bechtel who managed the works on Crossrail\u2019s Connaught tunnel in the London Docklands, says: \u201cIt is a boom time \u2013 not just in this country but around the world, now that the technology has become so extraordinary. There was a time when tunnelling presented a much more perilous face to cities \u2026 there used to be a huge worry that you\u2019d tip buildings, explode gas mains.\u201d As well as the domestic boom, tunnellers\u2019 prospects are good around the world: Bechtel is starting work in Riyadh on a metro project to dwarf Crossrail. Yet Miller sounds a warning note that Britain may end up missing out in a sector where it has traditionally been at the leading edge. Swaths of engineers are men on the verge of retirement; relatively few young people are entering the profession; and the proportion of women engineers (6%) in the UK is among the worst in Europe. Miller says: \u201cIt pains me that young girls are not understanding what a great career they could have here.\u201d There were women in all her tunnelling crews \u2013 labourers and engineers \u2013 she says, but admits: \u201cIt seems there are even fewer women in tunnelling \u2013 but the ones who are here find it meaningful, exciting and well-paid.\u201d This article was amended on 6 June 2015.

      "bodyText": "Speculation of an oil boom around Gatwick airport is back on the City\u2019s agenda after an independent report reinforced optimism that a small prospector had made a major find. The report by a major oil services group, Schlumberger, gave new flight on Friday to the shares of UK Oil and Gas (UKOG), the independent driller that announced in April it had made a strike of \u201cnational significance\u201d. Those early claims based on 158m barrels per square mile excited oil investors but were derided as hype by the industry\u2019s critics, who argued no one could tell how much, if any, oil could be extracted. However, Schlumberger\u2019s report has added to the expectation by suggesting there could be 270m barrels of oil per square mile at Horse Hill, in the Weald basin near Gatwick airport. Stephen Sanderson, UKOG\u2019s chief executive, was upbeat but careful not to play up the Schlumberger findings, saying they still gave no indication of recoverable reserves. \u201cThis independent technical viewpoint adds further weight to the potential significance of the HH-1 well and the potential of the Horse Hill licences,\u201d he said. UKOG shares, which had been suspended prior to the announcement after soaring in intraday trading on Wednesday, rose by 8% at one stage after the new assessment. Schlumberger said it planned to make a wider assessment of the Weald basin, which covers 2,124 square miles (5,500 sq km), and would provide further analysis about an area drilled unsuccessfully by others in the 60s.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In a digital era where most films are a few clicks away, the silver screen has lost some of its lustre as the home of movies. But the head of Britain\u2019s biggest arthouse chain believes the cinema retains a special appeal among the film-loving public. \u201cPeople like to gather in darkened spaces to watch stories \u2013 I don\u2019t think that will go away for a very long time,\u201d says Lyn Goleby, co-founder and managing director of Picturehouse Cinemas. It is one week before Picturehouse underlines its confidence in that argument by opening its biggest project yet \u2013 a grand seven-screen celluloid palace a stone\u2019s throw from Leicester Square in London\u2019s West End. It is a confident move, given a 5% fall in UK cinema admissions last year to 157.5m. Yet apart from asking the site manager when the water and gas will be connected, Goleby looks reasonably relaxed about the company\u2019s expansion plans. Indeed, Picturehouse added 100,000 visits last year, with 3.2m admissions. A West End cinema is the realisation of a long-held dream for Goleby: \u201cIt will be a flagship \u2013 it\u2019s bigger and more ambitious than anything we\u2019ve ever done in the past and yet all the threads of what we\u2019ve been doing for the last 20 years will all drive through this.\u201d Picturehouse Central will feature staples from its 21 other sites around the UK such as Silver Screen, for movie fans over 60, and a weekly cult film slot, while the new cinema will hold 1,000 seats and a members\u2019 bar with a roof terrace. The top ticket price will be \u00a318 \u2013 not that dissimilar to other Leicester Square cinemas \u2013 but Goleby stresses that a range of other discounts will be on offer. The Picturehouse Central site was a multiplex cinema until a year ago and has been given a makeover with more legroom, raked seating and an entrance on the theatreland thoroughfare of Shaftesbury Avenue. Despite Picturehouse\u2019s arthouse heritage it is part of the cinema mainstream now, having been bought by mass-market rival Cineworld \u2013 Britain\u2019s only listed cinema operator \u2013 in 2012 in a \u00a347.3m deal that reportedly made a multimillionaire of Goleby, who was a major shareholder. Cineworld\u2019s ownership allows Picturehouse to open more sites, she says. \u201cI would find a site, project finance it and do them one by one. Even when we had venture capital behind us it was still like reinventing the cinema and the refinancing model every time, whereas Cineworld bought us in order to invest.\u201d The Picturehouse chain saw revenues rise 8% to \u00a339.7m last year, a strong performance but a fraction of the \u00a3385.6m at Cineworld cinemas, which had nearly 48m admissions. Australia-born but raised in the UK, Goleby was a solicitor who ended up producing a handful of British films before getting involved in financing the first Picturehouse, the Phoenix in Oxford, in 1989. The Clapham Picturehouse in south London followed three years later and the Picturehouse portfolio includes cinemas in Exeter, York and Edinburgh, although London remains its stronghold with eight locations. Goleby says there are still plenty of locations that would welcome a \u201csmaller-scale quality outlet\u201d that appeals to the older demographic targeted by Picturehouse. The company hopes to open about three new sites a year, with a trio of cinemas planned for the capital. \u201cLondon\u2019s difficult \u2013 it takes many many years for a site to come to fruition. We develop them ourselves because we can\u2019t generally work with developers \u2013 the economics don\u2019t usually work for us. We don\u2019t simply do the Hollywood blockbusters and we try to keep a quality threshold \u2013 that kicks through to the general economics. We have to be pretty tight with our rents.\u201d The only blemish on the Picturehouse copybook has been last year\u2019s dispute with staff at the Ritzy in Brixton over the London living wage, whichdragged on for four months. The campaign won support from the likes of Monty Python member Terry Jones and after several strikes the company eventually agreed to start paying staff \u00a38.80 a hour. When asked if she would have handled the situation differently, Goleby pauses. \u201cThat\u2019s a difficult one \u2013 you can\u2019t regret it because we had to do what we had to do. The realities are that the way 10p on a front-of-house person\u2019s wage multiplies up in a company with a lot of hours and a lot of staff \u2013 it absolutely tips the balance of whether you can make profits or not make profits.\u201d Can that be true when a seat costs as much as \u00a318? \u201cYou divvy that out and you give away your 50% to the distributor and your X per cent here and Y per cent to the rent, cleaning, heat and light, rates and all of those things \u2013 the actual margin for profit is surprisingly slim,\u201d Goleby says. \u201cWe have a lot of staff and you multiply up thousands and thousands of hours and you\u2019re talking hundreds of thousands of pounds. So there weren\u2019t many choices for us. We know we\u2019re one of the best payers in the industry. I never ever wanted to be against our workforce and throughout it was all very good humoured on both sides. It was only bad humoured when people who weren\u2019t our people got involved.\u201d She believes social media will allow film buffs to have a much greater say in deciding what films will be shown in their local cinema. As a result, Picturehouse has created Ourscreen, which offers the cinema equivalent of video on demand. Adopting a concept first deployed in the US, Ourscreen allows cinephiles to choose the film, the venue, the date and the screening time, and when enough people sign up, the screening takes place. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I think cinema will go in the future.\u201d Goleby says. Picturehouse\u2019s five biggest box office hits: The King\u2019s Speech (released 2011) Skyfall (2012) Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) The Artist (2011) Slumdog Millionaire (2009)",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia has bulldozed fellow members of the Opec oil cartel to hold production levels at the current level, ensuring lower crude and petrol prices should continue for the foreseeable future. The world\u2019s most powerful oil-producing country is determined to keep down the value of oil to try to reassert the dominance of Opec against its new rivals, the shale companies in North America. Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said Opec\u2019s latest ministerial meeting in Vienna on Friday had been amicable, despite fears among some cartel members that a persistent oversupply of crude could push prices even lower. The price of the key Brent blend crude fell $1.62 to $62 a barrel after the meeting and compares with the $115 seen 12 months ago before traders panicked about the scale of US output growth and faltering demand. In fact, prices had been steadily recovering this year from a $45 low in January but continued gloom that they could remain low this year has led to major spending cuts by the oil industry in Aberdeen and other energy hubs. Meanwhile, the price of unleaded petrol for cars has fallen to about 113p a litre in the UK compared with 130p a year ago. Diesel prices are down from about 135p a litre to 118p, according to the AA motoring organisation.

The strategy has continued and the Saudis insisted everyone was happy. \u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised at how amicable the meeting was,\u201d Naimi said as he left Opec\u2019s headquarters in Vienna. He confirmed the group had agreed to stick to \u201cthe same ceiling\u201d, even though some members of the oil cartel have been cheating on their quotas. Official production is 1m barrels higher than the 31m-barrel-a-day official output target. \u201cThe market is in a transition phase, it is not stable,\u201d the United Arab Emirates\u2019 oil minister, Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui, told Reuters before the meeting. \u201cWe are optimistic about what happened in the first quarter in terms of [the price] correction.\u201d Low oil prices do not worry Saudi Arabia, which has $300bn (\u00a3200bn) in its sovereign wealth funds, but are devastating for other Opec members such as Iran, Venezuela and Nigeria, whose public finances are much weaker.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Walmart\u2019s relationships with its suppliers of poultry, seafood, bread, bananas and other foodstuffs raise serious concerns over environmental and labour practices and how the retail giant enforces its code of ethics, according to a report released on Thursday. The Food Chain Workers\u2019 Alliance (FCWA) report, Walmart at the Crossroads, was released on the eve of Walmart\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting. FCWA co-director Jos\u00e9 Oliva told the Guardian his organisation researched how Walmart enforces its code of ethics when dealing with its suppliers. \u201cWe wanted to investigate whether Walmart\u2019s claims, both on sustainability in terms of the environment and in terms of fairness, hold any water,\u201d he said. Walmart, which sells a quarter of groceries purchased in the US, recently prompted a largely positive reaction when it announced wage increases for half a million employees. But the FCWA report will not make comfortable reading at company headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas. The seafood section of the report, for example, pointed to the Guardian\u2019s recent investigation into the shrimp industry in Thailand, which revealed the use of slave labor. The chapter on poultry highlighted a $3.95m fine that the Environmental Protection Agency ordered Tyson, a processor which supplies Walmart, to pay in 2013 \u201cto address threats of accidental chemical releases after anhydrous ammonia was released\u201d. Concerns about Walmart\u2019s standards relate to its powerful position within a rapidly consolidating US food system. The company rose to prominence by demanding suppliers cut prices so it could offer bargain-basement rates to consumers. Craig Chase, who studies food system issues at the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University, said the domination of large companies such as Walmart leads to distortions in production. \u201cIf you have a business arrangement with a buyer like Walmart and their demands keep getting larger,\u201d Chase said, \u201cyou put out a bid on that business, and what you\u2019re going to try and do is to get your production to match their buying patterns.\u201d Oliva said this pushed suppliers \u201cto cut corners\u201d. One recommendation in the FCWA report is that Walmart should adopt a third-party monitoring system, in order to ensure that suppliers comply with the company\u2019s regulations. Another says the company should offer farmers, ranchers and fishermen long-term contracts that reflect the costs of production. Asked about the report, a Walmart spokesperson said the company was \u201ccommitted to the welfare of the people who work to produce products throughout our supply chain\u201d and pursued \u201ca robust responsible sourcing program\u201d. \u201cOur expectations are to treat workers with respect and dignity, and we do not want to work with suppliers unless they share this commitment,\u201d the spokesperson said. Oliva acknowledged that Walmart was positioning itself for change. \u201cThis feels like it\u2019s a real opportunity for Walmart to do the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a drumbeat of different announcements about what they want to do and how they want to be perceived. \u201cThe question is, is it going to just be a PR stunt, or are they going to actually do something substantive to change the working conditions for millions of people and actually improve the environment?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "HSBC\u2019s procedures to prevent money laundering, sanction-breaking and criminal activity still have deficiencies so serious that to publicly disclose them would risk serious crime, the US Department of Justice has said. The embarrassing disclosure of continuing issues with HSBC\u2019s processes is contained in a 16-page motion filed to a US court this week by the DoJ, which is seeking to keep confidential a report on the bank that is more than 1,000 pages long. It comes after HSBC Suisse was fined \u00a327.8m ($30.9m) by Swiss authorities on Thursday, the largest fine in the country\u2019s history, for \u201corganisational deficiencies\u201d that had enabled money laundering by its clients. The private bank is subject to regular audits and reports by an external monitor under the terms of a deferred prosecution agreement with US authorities, signed in 2012, which also imposed a record $1.9bn fine on HSBC for its role in aiding money laundering by Mexican drug cartels. The DoJ filing lists a number of reasons why the agency supports keeping the full report from public view, including ensuring that bank staff continue to cooperate with the monitor, and allowing the oversight to continue effectively. The filing goes far further than previous public reports in listing inadequacies in the ability of HSBC, the world\u2019s second-largest bank, to prevent criminal activity by its clients. \u201cAs general examples,\u201d the motion states, \u201cthe monitor identifies certain areas within HSBC Group where the understanding of money laundering and financial crime red flags continues to lag. \u201cThe monitor also identifies areas where new compliance policies have not yet been implemented, including areas where the lack of due diligence currently exposes HSBC to serious money laundering and sanctions risks.\u201d The DoJ then goes on to state that it does not believe the failings represented \u201cintentional misconduct\u201d or \u201cbad faith\u201d on the part of HSBC\u2019s management, but rather that fixing the bank\u2019s broken processes was slow work. \u201c[I]f made public, these deficiencies could be exploited by those who would promote criminal activity, transfer the proceeds of crime, or evade US sanctions,\u201d the filing says. The section concludes that if the monitor\u2019s discoveries of where HSBC struggled to track its clients were made public, the information could be \u201cused as a road map by criminal actors to exploit compliance weaknesses at HSBC and other banks\u201d. The official summary report made public as a letter in April used much milder language to express concerns about HSBC\u2019s processes, stating \u201cin certain instances the monitor believes that HSBC Group\u2019s progress has been too slow\u201d, adding that in some areas the bank\u2019s \u201chistorical cultural deficiencies continue to pervade its operations today\u201d. In April the Guardian published excerpts of a leaked transcript of a meeting between HSBC and the monitor in which a senior compliance officer warned the bank was \u201ccast-iron certain\u201d to have another major regulatory breach at some point in the future. In a statement, an HSBC spokesman said the monitor had recognised the bank had made significant progress and was in compliance with its agreement. \u201cThe Justice Department recognised in its letter that HSBC has made material progress toward meeting the most stringent compliance standards imposed to date upon a global financial institution,\u201d he said. \u201cWe continue to meet all of our obligations under the DPA [deferred prosecution agreement], and remain firmly committed to putting in place a robust AML [anti-money laundering] and sanctions compliance programme. We are making steady progress toward that objective and appreciate the monitor\u2019s ongoing work.\u201d HSBC separately confirmed it had launched an internal review after being named in separate US court documents in connection with allegations of corruption among senior Fifa officials. HSBC accounts had been involved, the filings stated, in a $500,000 (\u00a3328,000) transfer from a sports marketing company connected with Fifa to a luxury yacht manufacturer, as well as a number of wire transfers connected to alleged payment of bribes or kickbacks. A US attorney said the banks named in the filings might be investigated for their role in the alleged misconduct. \u201cPart of our investigation will look at the conduct of the financial institutions to see whether they were cognisant of the fact they were helping launder these bribe payments,\u201d the acting US attorney for the eastern district of New York, Kelly Currie, told a press conference last week. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say if there is any problematic behaviour, but it will be part of our investigation.\u201d An HSBC spokesman told the Guardian: \u201cWe are continuing to review the allegations in the indictments against certain Fifa executives and others, to ensure that our services are not being misused for financial crime.\u201d Thursday\u2019s fine came in the wake of the publication of the HSBC Files by numerous news outlets across the globe, including the Guardian, Le Monde, BBC, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and others, led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy added 280,000 jobs in May \u2013 but the unemployment rate rose to 5.5%. Economists expected US employment to have grown by 225,000 jobs last month, and for the unemployment rate to hold at a seven-year low of 5.4%. The number of Americans participating in the labor force in May increased by 397,000, causing the labor participation rate to increase from 62.8% in April to 62.9%. This could imply that Americans who have previously stopped looking for work are now feeling more optimistic about the US job market and are once again starting to look for jobs. \u201cNot only did we have more people working, but we had more people looking for work and that\u2019s actually a positive,\u201d Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC, told the Guardian. \u201cIf you see an increase in the unemployment rate but it\u2019s due to labor force growth and you have a lot of jobs, then that\u2019s an indication that people are feeling more confident in the job market. They are out there looking for work. We shouldn\u2019t view the increase in unemployment rate as a negative. It\u2019s actually a positive.\u201d The US unemployment rate is based on the number of Americans looking for jobs. Those who have given up on their job search are not counted. As Americans re-enter the job market and begin to look for jobs anew, they are once again counted as unemployed, thus driving up the unemployment rate. So far this year, the economy has added an average of 194,000 new jobs a month, a slower rate than the 281,000 jobs created each month in the second half of 2014. On average, about 260,000 jobs were created each month of 2014. Last year was the best year for job growth since 1999. Job creation is expected to slow further by 2016. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep going at 200,000 a month,\u201d said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economic research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d \u201cWe are not going to add 280,000 jobs a month but I certainly think that we are capable of adding 225,000 to 250,000 jobs per month through the rest of 2015,\u201d said Faucher. \u201cThat\u2019s about double that we need to keep up with the normal growth in the labor force. I do think that we will see the unemployment rate continue to decline. I think that we will see more people come into the labor force and that we will see stronger wage growth as businesses are forced to bid up wages in order to attract workers.\u201d Many Federal Reserve officials feel that the economic data is not strong enough to justify raising interest rates this month when they meet on 16-17 June. Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen did, however, say that an interest rate hike \u201cwill be appropriate at some point this year\u201d. \u201cThere are at least some encouraging signs of a pickup so far this year,\u201d Yellen said at the end of May. \u201cThe fact that some large companies such as Walmart and Target have announced wage increases for their employees also might be a sign that larger wage gains are on the horizon.\u201d In May, average hourly earnings increased by 8 cents to $24.96. Over the past year, average hourly earnings have increased by 2.3%. That\u2019s still not enough to impact the average worker. According to the Economic Policy Institute, without the 3%-4% wage growth, average workers will not benefit from the economic growth. Among other data pointing to economic recovery is the historically low number of jobless claims, which dropped to 276,000 earlier this week. The four-week average is 274,750, and the number of applications for unemployment benefits has remained below 300,000 for 13 weeks. Three days before the May jobs numbers were released, the US secretary of labor, Thomas E Perez, visited Baltimore and delivered a speech on summer jobs. During his speech, the secretary spoke about youth unemployment and the unemployment rate of black Americans, which is twice that of white Americans. \u201cDespite progress in recent years, the unemployment rate for young people between 16 to 24 years old is still 11.6%,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re an African American in that age group, you have about a 1 in 5 chance of being out of work.\u201d After dropping to 9.6% in April, the unemployment rate for black Americans once again rose to 10.2%. The unemployment rate for white Americans remained unchanged at 4.7%. The unemployment rate for American teenagers aged 16 to 19 went up to 17.9% from 17.1% in April.",

      "body": "<p>The US economy added 280,000 jobs in May \u2013 but the unemployment rate rose to 5.5%.<br></p> <p>Economists expected US employment to have grown by 225,000 jobs last month, and for the unemployment rate to hold at a seven-year low of 5.4%.</p> <p>The number of Americans participating in the labor force in May increased by 397,000, causing the labor participation rate to increase from 62.8% in April to 62.9%. This could imply that Americans who have previously stopped looking for work are now feeling more optimistic about the US job market and are once again starting to look for jobs. </p> <p>\u201cNot only did we have more people working, but we had more people looking for work and that\u2019s actually a positive,\u201d Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC, told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cIf you see an increase in the unemployment rate but it\u2019s due to labor force growth and you have a lot of jobs, then that\u2019s an indication that people are feeling more confident in the job market. They are out there looking for work. We shouldn\u2019t view the increase in unemployment rate as a negative. It\u2019s actually a positive.\u201d </p> <p>The US unemployment rate is based on the number of Americans looking for jobs. Those who have given up on their job search are not counted. As Americans re-enter the job market and begin to look for jobs anew, they are once again counted as unemployed, thus driving up the unemployment rate. </p> <p>So far this year, the economy has added an average of 194,000 new jobs a month, a slower rate than the 281,000 jobs created each month in the second half of 2014. On average, about 260,000 jobs were created each month of 2014. Last year was the best year for job growth since 1999. Job creation is expected to slow further by 2016.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t keep going at 200,000 a month,\u201d said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economic research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cWe are not going to add 280,000 jobs a month but I certainly think that we are capable of adding 225,000 to 250,000 jobs per month through the rest of 2015,\u201d said Faucher. \u201cThat\u2019s about double that we need to keep up with the normal growth in the labor force. I do think that we will see the unemployment rate continue to decline. I think that we will see more people come into the labor force and that we will see stronger wage growth as businesses are forced to bid up wages in order to attract workers.\u201d</p> <p>Many Federal Reserve officials feel that the economic data is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/20/federal-reserve-june-early-interest-rates\">not strong enough to justify raising interest rates this month</a> when they meet on 16-17 June. Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen did, however, say that an interest rate hike \u201cwill be appropriate at some point this year\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/22/janet-yellen-federal-reserve-raise-interest-rates-appropriate\">Janet Yellen says interest rate hike 'will be appropriate' later this year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are at least some encouraging signs of a pickup so far this year,\u201d Yellen said at the end of May. \u201cThe fact that some large companies such as Walmart and Target have announced wage increases for their employees also might be a sign that larger wage gains are on the horizon.\u201d</p> <p>In May, average hourly earnings increased by 8 cents to $24.96. Over the past year, average hourly earnings have increased by 2.3%. That\u2019s still not enough to impact the average worker. According to <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/nominal-wage-tracker/\">the Economic Policy Institute</a>, without the 3%-4% wage growth, average workers will not benefit from the economic growth.</p> <p>Among other data pointing to economic recovery is the historically low number of jobless claims, which dropped to 276,000 earlier this week. The four-week average is 274,750, and the number of applications for unemployment benefits has remained below 300,000 for 13 weeks.</p> <p>Three days before the May jobs numbers were released, the US secretary of labor, Thomas E Perez, visited Baltimore and delivered <a href=\"http://www.dol.gov/_sec/media/speeches/20150603_Perez.htm\">a speech on summer jobs</a>. During his speech, the secretary spoke about youth unemployment and the unemployment rate of black Americans, which is twice that of white Americans.</p> <p>\u201cDespite progress in recent years, the unemployment rate for young people between 16 to 24 years old is still 11.6%,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re an African American in that age group, you have about a 1 in 5 chance of being out of work.\u201d</p> <p>After dropping to 9.6% in April, the unemployment rate for black Americans once again rose to 10.2%. The unemployment rate for white Americans remained unchanged at 4.7%. </p> <p>The unemployment rate for American teenagers aged 16 to 19 went up to 17.9% from 17.1% in April. </p>",

The so-called troika decided that it was time Greece was brought to its senses. The posturing, the rhetorical flourishes, the shows of defiance had gone on for long enough. A tough set of proposals was drawn up, including demands for VAT, pension and wage bargaining reform that the troika knew Greece would find unpalatable. But so what? Greece was running out of cash. It had only been able to make its last repayment to the IMF with money held by the IMF itself. The next deadline was looming, the Greek economy has slid back into recession, the country badly needs access to the \u20ac7bn being held back by the troika until a reform package is agreed.

      "bodyText": "Greece will do everything it can to remain part of the eurozone, a government minister has said, after the debt-laden country missed a \u20ac300m (\u00a3220m) debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund and raised fears about the future of Europe\u2019s single currency. The economy minister, George Stathakis, gave the first official confirmation that Greece could have made the repayment to the Washington-based fund but chose not to do so in the face of demands to overhaul its economy by its lenders, which also include the EU and European Central Bank. With the crisis surrounding Greece\u2019s continued membership of the euro in its fifth year, Stathakis said the government was unable to accept the terms set out by its creditors, who are demanding bigger budget surpluses and tougher cuts to pensions as well an overhaul of its labour market. Stathakis, a minister in the Syriza party that was elected with a promise to ease the austerity imposed by creditors during a series of bailouts, said: \u201cWe have a mandate from the Greek people to go on, to try to change the terms of the agreement. Greece has to remain in the euro, otherwise we do not have any mandate to take action.\u201d Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he also said the government \u2013 which could be forced to call snap elections \u2013 was keen to get a deal from the three main creditors. \u201cWe are looking forward to getting a deal as soon as possible. The Greek government cannot accept these new proposals put on the table,\u201d he said. Among the requirements being asked of Greece are public spending cuts, and tax rises worth 2% of GDP, through changes to pensions and VAT, which are strongly opposed by the anti-austerity Syriza party. Instead of making a \u20ac300m debt repayment to the IMF on Friday when it fell due, Greece is instead bundling up four payments it was due to pay this month. These are worth \u20ac1.6bn and Greece is promising to pay at the end of June. As the standoff between Greece and its creditors continued, a group of economists, including Thomas Piketty and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, united to express their concern about the ongoing austerity measures. \u201cAusterity drastically reduces revenue from tax reform, and restricts the space for change to make public administration accountable and socially efficient,\u201d they wrote in the Financial Times. \u201cAnd the constant concessions required by the government mean that Syriza is in danger of losing political support and this its ability to carry out a reform programme that will bring Greece out of the crisis. Syriza is the only hope for legitimacy in Greece.\u201d They wrote to the Financial Times in January to say: \u201cWe believe it is important to distinguish from reforms; to condemn anti austerity does not entail being anti-reform\u201d.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group has docked \u00a3350,000 from the bonus of its chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, after being fined \u00a3117m for mishandling compensation claims for payment protection insurance. Horta-Os\u00f3rio apologised for the conduct of the bank \u2013 which is still 19% owned by the taxpayer \u2013 after it was forced to review 1.2m customer complaints. The review was prompted when the Financial Conduct Authority found Lloyds failed to treat customers fairly. Even though the chief executive\u2019s bonus was reduced, he could be in line for a \u00a34m payout from bonuses awarded in 2012 and 2013 \u2013 the period when the bank was found to be treating customers unfairly \u2013 and another \u00a36.4m from a long-term scheme. The fine on Friday was prompted by a new policy introduced by Lloyds in March 2012, known as Lighthouse. Under Lighthouse, also referred to as \u201cthe over-riding principle\u201d, the bank told its 7,000 special PPI call centre staff to assume that its sales of PPI were \u201ccompliant and robust\u201d and that claims were therefore invalid. They denied compensation \u2013 unless told otherwise by their managers. Internal documents showed that as soon as Lighthousewas introduced there was a fall in the number of complaints upheld. On the first day the policy was in operation the number fell by 10% . But a review by the FCA in November 2012 found the bank had unfairly rejected 57% of the complaints. \u201cWhilst our intentions were right, we made mistakes in our handling of some PPI complaints. I am very sorry for this,\u201d said Horta-Os\u00f3rio, whose pay packet in 2014 was \u00a311.5m. John Mann, the Labour MP who sat on the Treasury select committee, said Lloyds\u2019 senior management had failed to \u201cget a grip\u201d on the problem. \u201cThe taxpayer still owns a 19% stake in the bank and its time we heard from the senior non-executive directors about what they have been doing whilst the bank lurches from one scandal to the next,\u201d Mann said. In anticipation of the penalty by the FCA, the bank announced in February that it had frozen deferred bonuses from 2012 and 2013 for its executive team. A total of \u00a32.65m in bonuses are being permanently withheld, which means that millions will still be handed out to the top management team. The bonus pool for the entire staff has been cut by \u00a330m. The \u00a3350,000 being withheld from Horta-Os\u00f3rio represents approximately 12% of his payout relating to the period covered by the FCA fine. The average being withheld from the dozen or so members of the executive committee is about 25%. Among them are thought to be the outgoing head of the retail bank, Alison Brittain who is leaving to run Whitbread, and the finance director, George Culmer. . Georgina Philippou, acting director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said PPI complaint handling was a high priority for the regulator. \u201cIf trust in financial services is going to be restored following the widespread mis-selling of PPI, then customers need to be confident that their complaints will be treated fairly. The size of the fine today reflects the fact that so many complaints were mishandled by Lloyds. \u201cCustomers who had already been treated unfairly once by being mis-sold PPI were treated unfairly a second time and denied the redress they were owed. Lloyds\u2019 conduct was unacceptable,\u201d she said. Customers were told their complaints had been investigated when they had not been. The FCA provided a number of examples: A complaint in 2012 from a customer with a personal loan who said he did not know he had been sold PPI. The complaint was rejected even though the handler did not have access to any information about the sale. The customer was told, however, that \u201cappropriate weight and balanced consideration\u201d had been given to the claim. A customer who said she did not know PPI had been sold alongside her credit card had her complaint rejected after a complaint handler failed to reach her after three phone calls \u2013 the number of attempts required by the bank\u2019s policy. Another customer had his claim rejected after a complaint handler failed to reach him after making three phone calls on the same day. The bank rejected the claim on the basis that there was no information to back up the claim. The Lloyds fine surpasses the previous record for Clydesdale bank, which was fined \u00a321m in April. The Australian-owned bank was found to have sloppy internal procedures and also misled the industry adjudicator, the Financial Ombudsman Service. The banking industry has so far set aside \u00a325bn as a result of the PPI scandal. Lloyds has the biggest single bill, at \u00a312bn, with \u00a3710m related to the FCA action.",
