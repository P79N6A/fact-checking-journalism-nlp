      "bodyText": "Veteran water regulator Sir Ian Byatt has called for ministers to revive Victorian-era dividend controls on the industry to tame a corrosive culture of heavy borrowing and high shareholder payouts that has left it unable to carry out major investment projects without taxpayer support. With consumer price limits up to 2020 due to be thrashed out later this year, Byatt, Britain's top water regulator throughout the 1990s, has called for new rules requiring any windfall profits to be shared between shareholders and consumers. Launching a paper from thinktank CentreForum, he proposed that utilities should be forced to reduce water bills if they seek to pay bumper dividends in excess of returns envisaged by the regulator at the time of their five-yearly pricing review. \"I would like to see a return to the kind of sliding scale control of dividends used to regulate the British gas industry in the 19th century,\" he said \u2013 a reference to a regime imposed on the commercially volatile early gas supply industry. Byatt has been one of the leading critics of the water industry in recent years, with much of his attacks focused on private-equity-owned firms, labouring under heavy borrowings taken on to boost shareholder returns. \"In the case of Thames Water, this has damaged its credit rating, leading to requests to government for guarantees to enable the company to carry out the Thames Tideway sewerage project,\" he said. This 16-mile addition to London's sewerage network is estimated to cost \u00a34.2bn and has been described as the biggest improvement to the system since Sir Joseph Bazalgette's pioneering efforts in the 1850s. Since Ofwat's last five-yearly price review in 2009, the regulator has acknowledged that several highly indebted water companies have enjoyed previously unforeseen profits from a period of very low debt financing costs and stubbornly above-target inflation. A spokesman for Ofwat said: \"We are changing a culture to get companies to take more responsibility for their plans and listen to their customers \u2013 not simply tick regulatory boxes. \"We have also challenged the sector to become more transparent to make sure companies maintain their legitimacy with their customers. \"We welcome all contributions to the debate. Our absolute priority will be making sure customers get a fair deal.\" The CentreForum report, to which Byatt contributed forwarding remarks, sets out a series of options to give regulations more teeth. Condemning \"an opaque, overleveraged and poorly regulated industry that consistently places short-term profit above the interests of consumers and taxpayers,\" the report raises the prospect of a levy on utility firms heaped high with debt. The report's author George Turner also calls on ministers to learn lessons from Germany, where regulators have imposed rules limiting the extent to which utilities can exploit tax rules by taking on high borrowings that lower their bill. \"For years now customers have been paying too much for their water and shareholders have been running off with giant profits. \"This is unacceptable in an industry which is so fundamental to people's lives and where customers cannot choose their supplier.\" \"What is worse, excessive profits have come about through a weakening of the financial strength of companies built up over many years of public investment. \"It is now time for parliament and the regulator to demand better standards from the water industry.\" Research from the Consumer Council for Water, a government-sponsored body established to represent household customers, has estimated that water company profits were inflated by \u00a3720m over the last two years due to low interest rates and higher-than-expected inflation. One industry insider, who declined to be named, insisted the regulatory model was working well. \"Ofwat sets price limits at a level which should allow a well-managed, efficient company to deliver its statutory commitments, meet its targets and finance itself effectively. \"That includes paying dividends to shareholders at a level that provides an appropriate return on investment, subject of course to delivering on commitments and meeting targets. \"This policy has enabled more than \u00a3100bn to be invested in the UK water industry since privatisation in 1989.\"",

The highly rated shares barely budged even though founder Nick Robertson's statement that he and Bostock had agreed that \"Asos is not the right platform for her talent\" seemed to be crafted to be obscure. The suggestion \u2013 though it's hard to be entirely sure \u2013 is that Bostock, fresh from Marks &amp; Spencer, was steeped in the ways of big-company retailers and found herself a cultural misfit at a go-go firm like Asos, purveyor of chic and cheap garments to 20-somethings. Okay, fine, sometimes appointments don't work out. It's better for both sides to accept the fact and say their farewells. But does Asos still feel the need to recruit external expertise as it approaches the big league? The initial logic in pursuing Bostock was understandable. Revenues this year will be about \u00a3750m and applying some mainstream retailing discipline to the supply chain could be valuable. After all, Robertson can't be everywhere and he's running a company that is now valued at an astonishing \u00a33.7bn. \"The board will consider whether there is a need to seek a replacement for Kate,\" said the statement. Yes, it's perfectly fair for Asos to take time to ponder. But it had be better be prepared to explain its thinking in more detail.",

It's better for both sides to accept the fact and say their farewells. But does Asos still feel the need to recruit external expertise as it approaches the big league?</p> <p>The initial logic in pursuing Bostock was understandable. Revenues this year will be about \u00a3750m and applying some mainstream retailing discipline to the supply chain could be valuable. After all, Robertson can't be everywhere and he's running a company that is now valued at an astonishing \u00a33.7bn.</p> <p>\"The board will consider whether there is a need to seek a replacement for Kate,\" said the statement. Yes, it's perfectly fair for Asos to take time to ponder. But it had be better be prepared to explain its thinking in more detail.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In late June the British Geological Survey announced the world's largest shale-gas field. The Bowland Shale, which lies beneath Lancashire and Yorkshire, contains 50% more gas than the combined reserves of two of the largest fields in the United States, the Barnett Shale and the Marcellus Shale.</p> <p>The United Kingdom has been reluctant to join the hydraulic-fracturing (or fracking) revolution. Yet tapping the Bowland Shale could reignite the UK economy and deliver huge cuts in CO2 emissions.</p> <p>At the same time, the UK parliament has approved stringent new measures to reduce carbon emissions by 2020, with the biggest CO2 cuts by far to come from an increase of more than 800% in offshore wind power over the next seven years. But offshore wind power is so expensive that it will receive at least three times the traded cost of regular electricity in subsidies \u2013 more than even solar power, which was never at an advantage in the UK. For minimal CO2 reduction, the UK economy will pay dearly.</p> <p>This is just one example of current climate policy's utter remove from reality \u2013 and not just in the UK. We are focusing on insignificant \u2013 but very costly \u2013 green policies that make us feel good, while ignoring or actively discouraging policies that would dramatically reduce emissions and make economic sense.</p> <p>Consider the three standard arguments for a green economy: climate change, energy security and jobs. As it turns out, fracking does better on all three.</p> <p>Assuming complete success for the UK's scheme, offshore wind power could produce more than 10% of the country's electricity in 2020 and reduce its CO2 emissions by up to 22Mt, or 5%, per year. But the cost would also be phenomenal. The UK would pay at least $8bn annually in subsidies to support this inherently inefficient technology.</p> <p>Compare this with the opportunity of the Bowland Shale. If, by 2020, the UK could exploit its reserves there at just one-third the intensity of the exploitation of the Barnett and Marcellus Shales today, the outcome would be phenomenal.</p> <p>Natural gas is much more environmentally friendly than coal, which continues to be the mainstay of electricity production around the world and in the UK. Gas emits less than half the CO2 per kWh produced, and it emits much lower amounts of other pollutants like NOx, SO2, black carbon, CO, mercury, and particulates. If the UK sold its shale gas both domestically and abroad to replace coal, it could reduce local air pollution significantly and reduce global carbon emissions by 170Mt, or more than a third of UK carbon emissions. At the same time, instead of costing $8bn (\u00a35.3bn) a year, shale-gas production would add about $10bn (\u00a36.6bn) a year to the UK economy.</p> <p>Likewise, it is often argued that the green economy will increase energy security, as green resources will leave countries less dependent on fossil-fuel imports. But even much higher supplies of wind power would improve security only marginally, because the UK would still have to import just as much oil (wind replaces mostly coal, rarely oil) and much of its gas, leaving it dependent on Russia. For countries closer to Russia's sphere of influence, like Poland and Ukraine, this dependence becomes palpable.</p> <p>And yet the UK could improve its energy security dramatically, because it has enough gas reserves to cover roughly the entirety of its gas consumption for a half-century or more. Moreover, increased UK production would lower world prices, making countries with fewer or no shale-gas resources safer. And, of course, any country that is $10bn richer, rather than $8bn poorer, will have a better chance to handle future problems.</p> <p>Finally, green-economy advocates promise a surfeit of green jobs. But economic research convincingly shows that while subsidies can buy extra jobs, they eventually have to be financed with increased taxes, costing an equal number of jobs elsewhere.</p> <p>In comparison, shale gas in the US has created an estimated 600,000 jobs that are generating about $100bn in added GDP and almost $20bn in public revenue.</p> <p>Current global climate policy is unsustainable; the UK's commitment to boosting offshore wind power is only the latest example. Distressed economies cannot afford to pay more than $350 to avoid each ton of CO2, which could be cut on the European market for about 50 times less. Shale gas could cut the cost of reducing CO2 seven times more while actually helping Europe's ailing economy.</p> <p>Though it is not the ultimate solution, shale gas is greener. With good regulation, during the coming decade it can do the most good worldwide in terms of cutting CO2 emissions and improving living conditions. Mindless subsidies that we cannot afford will not create a green economy; what will is investment in research and development to bring down costs, so that green energy eventually can outcompete gas.</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"www.project-syndicate.org\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2013.</p>",

Assuming complete success for the UK's scheme, offshore wind power could produce more than 10% of the country's electricity in 2020 and reduce its CO2 emissions by up to 22Mt, or 5%, per year. But the cost would also be phenomenal. The UK would pay at least $8bn annually in subsidies to support this inherently inefficient technology. Compare this with the opportunity of the Bowland Shale. If, by 2020, the UK could exploit its reserves there at just one-third the intensity of the exploitation of the Barnett and Marcellus Shales today, the outcome would be phenomenal. Natural gas is much more environmentally friendly than coal, which continues to be the mainstay of electricity production around the world and in the UK. Gas emits less than half the CO2 per kWh produced, and it emits much lower amounts of other pollutants like NOx, SO2, black carbon, CO, mercury, and particulates. If the UK sold its shale gas both domestically and abroad to replace coal, it could reduce local air pollution significantly and reduce global carbon emissions by 170Mt, or more than a third of UK carbon emissions. At the same time, instead of costing $8bn (\u00a35.3bn) a year, shale-gas production would add about $10bn (\u00a36.6bn) a year to the UK economy. Likewise, it is often argued that the green economy will increase energy security, as green resources will leave countries less dependent on fossil-fuel imports. But even much higher supplies of wind power would improve security only marginally, because the UK would still have to import just as much oil (wind replaces mostly coal, rarely oil) and much of its gas, leaving it dependent on Russia. For countries closer to Russia's sphere of influence, like Poland and Ukraine, this dependence becomes palpable. And yet the UK could improve its energy security dramatically, because it has enough gas reserves to cover roughly the entirety of its gas consumption for a half-century or more. Moreover, increased UK production would lower world prices, making countries with fewer or no shale-gas resources safer. And, of course, any country that is $10bn richer, rather than $8bn poorer, will have a better chance to handle future problems. Finally, green-economy advocates promise a surfeit of green jobs. But economic research convincingly shows that while subsidies can buy extra jobs, they eventually have to be financed with increased taxes, costing an equal number of jobs elsewhere. In comparison, shale gas in the US has created an estimated 600,000 jobs that are generating about $100bn in added GDP and almost $20bn in public revenue. Current global climate policy is unsustainable; the UK's commitment to boosting offshore wind power is only the latest example. Distressed economies cannot afford to pay more than $350 to avoid each ton of CO2, which could be cut on the European market for about 50 times less. Shale gas could cut the cost of reducing CO2 seven times more while actually helping Europe's ailing economy. Though it is not the ultimate solution, shale gas is greener. With good regulation, during the coming decade it can do the most good worldwide in terms of cutting CO2 emissions and improving living conditions. Mindless subsidies that we cannot afford will not create a green economy; what will is investment in research and development to bring down costs, so that green energy eventually can outcompete gas.

      "bodyText": "With the Greek general strike coming to a close (see 10.25am onwards, and 2.46pm onwards, for details, and 1.53pm for analysis) , and Europe's stock markets closed lower (see 5.04pm), it's time to wrap up for the day. Back tomorrow, for more action in Greece over the austerity bill, Ben Bernanke testifying at Congress, UK unemployment, Bank of England minutes, the latest twists in the eurozone crisis, and anything else that comes our way. Until then, thanks and goodnight. GW. The falls on today's stock markets came despite a bumper set of profits from Goldman Sachs. As Dominic Rushe writes from Wall Street: Goldman Sachs doubled its profits in the second quarter as the bank benefited from gains in fixed income, currency and commodity trading revenue. The Wall Street giant set out its latest quarterly earnings Tuesday morning announcing net income of $1.93bn, compared with $962m a year earlier. Net revenue, including net interest income, rose 30% to $8.61bn from $6.6bn last year. Some late news from Lisbon \u2013 Portugal's central bank has revised its economic forecasts. It now expects a slightly shallower slump this year -- with GDP shrinking by 2.0%, not 2.3% as before. But the Bank of Portugal also took the knife to its growth forecasts for 2014, scribbling out its projection of 1.1% in favour of just 0.3%. It also warned that the political instability was hurting the economy: The forecasts for the Portuguese economy are surrounded by particularly high uncertainty linked to the recent internal developments, adding to the challenges of the compulsory implementation of the adjustment programme. Portugal's politicians have been locked in talks this week, after the country's president insisted that the major parties should agree a deal to maintain stability before its bailout programme ends in 2014. Not the most thrilling day in the financial markets. Perhaps one of the least. Here's where the numbers finished: \u2022 FTSE 100: down 29 points at 6556, -0.45% \u2022 German DAX: down 29 points at 8205, - 0.35% \u2022 French CAC: down 26 points at 3851, -0.69% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 56 points at 7798, -0.7% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 67 points at 15529, -0.43% And in New York, the Dow Jones is down 43 points, or 0.28%, at 15441. Traders are waiting for Ben Bernanke, chair of the Federal Reserve, to testify at Congress tomorrow. He may give new insight into the Fed's plans for slowing its monetary easing programmes. There's also some interesting UK data out tomorrow morning, as CMC Market's Michael Hewson explains: Investors seem content to sit on the sidelines today ahead of a big day tomorrow, when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke starts his semi-annual testimony to Congress, while UK markets will be awaiting the first set of post Carney minutes from the Bank of England, as well as unemployment and average earnings data. This morning's weaker-than-expected ZEW survey of German economic confidence (details at 10.21am) also hit share prices, explains David Jones, chief market strategist at IG. The latest slump in EU car sales didn't help (details at 8.50am) We could lay today's blame for the sideways movement of European equity indices on the unexpected decline in the German economic sentiment survey, which fell for the first time in three months. The data point was the only real item of note in Europe today, as year-on-year inflation for the eurozone came in at 1.6% as expected. European car sales were abysmal, falling to a 16-year low with year-on-year sales for June declining by 6.3%. The extreme levels of unemployment in Europe have been blamed It's a big summer for Greece's tourist industry, with officials hoping for record numbers of visitors now the eurozone crisis has eased. General strikes and marches might not sound like sightseeing gold-dust -- but this photo suggests tourists were quite interested in today's events: Might be a different story if the teargas and stone-throwing youths return... Over in Cyprus today, the government is hoping to get a good report card from its lenders, who begin their first assessment of its bailout programme on Wednesday. While Greece's general strike was based on anger over the Troika's demands, the government in Nicosia is focused on persuading international creditors that it's sticking to the terms of its financial rescue when they complete their first assessment. Speaking to reporters earlier today, finance minister Haris Georgiades argued that the quickest way to escape the bailout terms is to implement the reforms demanded. The speedy exit from restructuring will allow us to take new steps that will further ease and ultimately eliminate capital controls. Those capital controls still restrict how much money Cyprus's citizens can withdraw from a bank, or take out of the country, making a 'Cypriot euro' less valuable than one in other countries. Georgiades also hinted that selling some of Cyprus's gold reserves, as outlined in the bailout deal, was not the only option to raise funds for its part of the deal, saying: It [the gold sale] will be considered, when the time comes, with options, or rather, all other options. The gold price has fallen sharply since Cyprus's bullion sale was originally agreed, from around $1,585 per ounce in early April to below $1,300 per ounce today. Athens police reckon that about 16,000 protesters gathered in the main Syntagma Square for today's demonstration, which (if accurate) is a rather smaller turnout than during previous marches. Eleni Fotopoulou, 58, a retired teacher and mother of two, summed up the situation in Athens today: It feels like Greece is dead and now the vultures are fighting over its corpse. I'm not angry anymore, I am disgusted. We have to fight back. And here's one more photo from outside the Athens parliament this lunchtime, where protesters chanted \"No more sacrifices\" and waved banners with slogans such as \"Fire the troika\". Although the low-key protests are over, for now at least, many Greek workers remain off work today as the general strike continues. Reuters sums up the situation: Domestic flights were disrupted after civil aviation unions staged a four-hour work stoppage and Athens's main tourist attraction - the Acropolis - shut early. City transport was also affected, with bus and trolley bus drives holding work stoppages in the morning and in the evening. Trains stopped running and tax offices and municipal services remained shut. Garbage collectors, bus drivers, bank employees and journalists were among other groups joining the walkout. Every strike in Greece has a slogan and today\u2019s, rather fittingly, is \u201cwe are people not numbers.\u201d In Europe\u2019s seemingly un-ending debt crisis, it is the human factor that has often got lost - never more so than in the country where it all began, writes Helena Smith from Athens. Athens\u2019 coalition government may insist that Greece is on the road torecovery but on the ground where the tell-take signs of six years of recession have left large swaths of the nation feeling increasingly desperate it is the opposite that rings true. Efklidis Tsakalotos, the left-wing Syria MP, was not far off the mark this morning when he told parliament (11.36am): the people running this country live in a different environment. They go to different hospitals. Their kids go to different schools. And they don\u2019t understand what people are going through. The Troika\u2019s obsession with budget targets \u2013 no matter what the social cost \u2013 is what today\u2019s protests are all about. Greeks have displayed immense patience \u2013 indeed fortitude \u2013 with austerity measures that have left over 1.3 million out of work, cut salaries by an average 25% and plunged more than a third of the population into poverty. The omnibus reform package that parliament must now enact for the country to win further EU-IMF rescue funds is unlikely to be scuppered by the strike (as I write it is being tweaked by ministers desperate to keep anti-austerity sentiment in check). But there are growing signs that Greece is reaching a tipping point. At a time when unemployment is nudging 27% the firing of some 25,000 civil servants \u2013 because no matter what language the dismissals are cloaked in that is what it amounts to \u2013 are simply seen as a demand too far. Had the public sector been streamlined earlier, when other indicators were not so off-target, the sackings may have been more palatable. If, in six months, there were tangible results with privatisations, such news might have been better too. As it is, the timing could not be worse. Barely a month after the debacle that followed prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 attempt to close ERT, the state broadcaster, the government has egg on its face again. When he visits Athens on Thursday, the protests will be a vivid reminder to Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, that far from being a success story Greece remains a minefield in the euro zone. HS. Guardian Witness are running an assignment for photos and videos of this week's protests in Greece. If you're there, you can take part very easily - just visit this page. MPs from the left-wing Syriza party took part in today's protests, coming out of the parliament building to hand a banner reading \"Let's fire the government. No lay-offs in the state and private sector\". At the other end of the eurozone, Ireland, there is some better news \u2013 400 new posts have been created by Internet security firm Symantec. From Dublin, Henry McDonald reports: The jobs will be based at Symantec's base in Blanchardstown, West Dublin with 200 going on stream immediately and a further 200 IT workers recruited over the next two years. They will work at the company's new European Customer Management Centre in the city. The company says it will be seeking highly-skilled, multilingual staff to take on the roles. Symantec has been in Blanchardstown for 22 years, and the base which employs just over 600 people, is already home to a security operations centre, as well as operations in business authentication, software development and testing. The new project is supported by Ireland's Industrial Development Authority, and its chief executive Barry O'Leary said Symantec is part of a thriving cluster of world leading security software companies operating in the Republic. This latest jobs boost comes less than a week after Standard &amp; Poor gave an upbeat forecast of the Irish economy and put the country's credit rating into the positive zone. The creation of these jobs also indicates that while domestic demand and the constrution industry remain in the doldrums the Republic's export led hi-tech sector continues to flourish in the face of the recession. Nick Malkoutzis, deputy editor of Greece's Kathimerini newspaper, confirms that today's Athens rally was a \"relatively low key protest\". More protests to come later today, though (including another gathering in Syntagma this evening). A couple more shots of today's protest march in Athens: A rally has also taken place in Chania, Crete, though. Here's a photo of the march passing through its port: Greek politics is also gripped by the repercussions of last night's parliamentary vote in favour of prosecuting the former finance minister George Papaconstantinou. Papaconstantinou is accused of mishandling the infamous \u201cLagarde list\u201d of 2079 suspected tax evaders with accounts in the Geneva branch of HSBC, and removing the names of his own relatives From Athens, Helena Smith explains that a five-member judicial council will decide whether the 52-year-old former minister will face a special court. Most analysts think it very likely that the court will be set up. Papaconstantinou told parliament that he'd been made a scapegoat, by a political establishment desperate to be seen to be cleaning up after the wrong-doing of the past. I absolutely and categorically deny these accusations,\u201d he told the chamber saying instead of pursuing the \u201creal, big scandals that have cost the country billions\u201d lawmakers were pursuing him on trumped-up charges. \u201cNot only is it unfair to attempt to wash the sins of many governments on my back, it\u2019s something more: it\u2019s dishonourable,\u201d And Helena reports that Papaconstantinou, a reform-minded moderate, has his supporters on both the left and right today. \"I do not for a minute think he was foolish enough to delete the names of his own relatives from the list,\u201d the right-wing publisher and analyst Giorgos Kyrtsos told me. \"He has become a convenient scapegoat.\" In the socialist Pasok party insiders also rued the development. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve to rot in prison,\u201d said one. \u201cAfter all he did a lot to modernise the economy. If he is guilty it is of miscalculating public anger when he did something as silly as erase those names.\u201d In a front-page editorial today, the mass-selling daily Ta Nea makes the point that unlike France, Germany, Spain and Italy - handed similar lists of suspected tax evaders by the then French finance minister Christine Lagarde - Greece has failed to rake in \u201ceven one euro\u201d from those on the list. If tried and found guilty of the charges, Papaconstantinou could face ten years or more in prison. Efklidis Tsakalotos, a left-wing MP from the Syriza coalition, has laid into Antonis Samaras's government in parliament today during the debate on the austerity bill (vote due tomorrow night). Tsakalotos called on the governing coalition to ditch its latest planned reforms. It's a disgrace for the government to say that things are getting better with unemployment at such a high level. It is clear that with the economy still shrinking that we need a change of course. The people running this country live in a different environment. They go to different hospitals. Their kids go to different schools. And they don't understand what people are going through. (via AP) However, if the bill is not passed then Greece's lenders will not hand over the rest of its bailout tranche.... Today's general strike will not succeed in persuading the Athens government to withdraw its austerity bill, predicts Martin Koehring, Greece analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit. Koehring also predicts that there's little chance of encouraging government MPs into a rebellion against the planned reforms and job cuts. He explains: The general strike is unlikely to succeed in its aim of forcing the government to withdraw its latest reform bill or convincing enough MPs to vote against it. Although the government only has the support of 155 MPs in the 300-seat parliament, it is improbable that there will be sufficient defections for the bill to be voted down. A major rebellion by coalition MPs so soon after last month's cabinet reshuffle is unlikely. But that doesn't mean the stike is meaningless. Instead, it shows the \"strong anti-austerity sentiment among the population\". The Economist Intelligence Unit continues to expect political risk (social unrest and a potential collapse of the two-party government coalition) to remain a major focal point in Greece this year and in 2014, Koehring added. A couple of photos of supporters of the Communist-affiliated trade union PAME marching up to, and past, the Athens parliament a few minutes ago: Back to the Greek general strike, and the first union demonstration against the government's austerity bill has reached Syntagma Square. Looks like a decent turnout (with the Greek parliament in the middle of the shot): Meanwhile, the ZEW survey of economic confidence in Germany has just missed expectations. At 36.3, the ZEW showed sentiment weakened, slighly, from May (when it registered 38.5). This follows unerwhelming German industrial production and foreign trade date. German economists are a little more optimistic about economic expectations for the Eurozone. However, there's a long way to go. As Zew puts it: The indicator for the current economic situation in the Eurozone has also improved and now stands at the minus 74.7 points-mark (up 4.8 points). Not much reaction in the City. Here's the statement from ZEW. The 2.9% annual rise in the UK consumer prices index (9.32am onwards) to a 14-month high could mark inflation's high point in the current cycle, argues George Buckley of Deutsche Bank, who called it \"encouraging news\", We think this is going to be the peak in inflation and inflation will fall in the second half of the year and beyond and get back towards its target, not at target but towards its target by the end of the year. But it is rather higher than inflation in other countries (CPI in the eurozone is just 1.6%), and outpacing the rise in British wages (around 1%). The TUC's Duncan Weldon doesn't expect any respite when we get UK unemployment stats tomorrow.... While Robert Wood of Berenberg says it's good news for governor Mark Carney: They say it\u2019s better to be lucky than good, and Mark Carney certainly appears to be lucky.... A fall in volatile air fares kept inflation from rising further. However: Britain is slowly but surely getting past the worst of its troubles. The recovery so far is built on sand. Household finances are not a pretty picture, with inflation eating into spending power and consumption therefore being sustained by sharp falls in the saving ratio. The official statement on UK inflation is online here. The rising cost of living in the UK last month was driven by increased prices of fuel, clothing and footware. But at 2.9%, CPI has come in below City expectations. And crucially, it means governor Mark Carney will not have to write a letter to the chancellor explaining why the Bank of England failed to keep inflation within one percentage point of 2%. The Retail Prices Index (RPI), the inflation measures used for wage negotiations, also came in slightly lower than forecast at 3.3%. Breaking: Inflation is up in the UK, with the consumer prices index jumping to 2.9% in June, from 2.7% in May. That's the highest level since April 2012. Familiar scenes in Athens this morning as the walkout hits transport links: The slump in Europe's car industry continues, with new figures released this morning showing that sales fell to a 17-year low in June. The European Automobile Manufacturers Association reported a 5.6% slump in new vehicle registrations across Europe in June, and a 6.6% fell for the first six months of 2013. That means the industry has sold around 400,000 fewer cars than a year ago during 2013, at a time when manufacturers are trying to cut capacity and improve competitiveness. European car sales have been sliding steadily since the eurozone crisis began -- apart from a small blip in April when sales rose year-on-year. Core eurozone countries are suffering now -- with German sales down -4.7% and France dropping by -8.4%. There was also a stunning 71% year-on-year plunge in sales in Ireland. Just 1,673 new vehicles were registrated in the Republic in June, down from 6,352 in June 2012. That puts Ireland's status as an austerity poster boy into perspective. Within manufacturers, Fiat suffered a -12.6% drop in sales, GM were down 9.9%, Peugeot-Citreon fell 10.8%, BMW dropped 7.9% and VW Group's sales were down 3.6%. Ford, though, gained +8.1%, and Jaguar Land Rover were up 1.6%. Here's the data (pdf). UPDATE: In the reader comments, grace5715 explains that the drop in Irish car sales follows a change to the registration system. (see here for the full story) Several protests are planned for Athens today, with the first starting shortly, and an all-night sit-in planned outside the Greek parliament \u2022 10:30 local time (8.30am BST): Communist workers group PAME will gather in Omonia Square in Athens, then coverge with union protest in Syntagma. A seperate march will take place in the city of Thessaloniki. \u202211:00 local time (9am BST): Employees from the ADEDY, GSEE and POE-OTA (municipal employees) unions will start a protest in Klafthmonos Square and move to Syntagma, outside Parliament \u2022 20:00 local time (6pm BST): Municipal workers will begin a sit-in and overnight protest in Syntagma Square, as MPs debate the latest austerity bill required to secure bailout funds. That's via Living in Greece, which has more details of today's disruption. By my reckoning this is the fourth general strike in Greece this year (following walkouts on 20 February, 1 May and 13 June). Greek unions hope today's walkout can change the government's approach to the crisis (despite its austerity measures, such as 15,000 civil service job cuts by the end of 2014, being largely dictated by its Troika of lenders). Private sector union GSEE declared: We are continuing our fight to put an end to policies that annihilate workers and drive the economy to an even greater recession. We will stand up to those who, with wrong and dead-end choices, have driven the Greek people to poverty and despair. While ADEDY, representing state workers, has attacked the way layoffs are being imposed on staff, such as those at the state broadcaster ERT which was closed down last month. It said: The policy of mass layoffs, the dismantling of public institutions responsible and the demolition of any notion of labor rights inaugurate a new undemocratic governance of the country. Today's walkout has already left trains halted in their sidings,and meant many government offices are shut, Reuters reports from Athens. Air traffic control staff are also holding a four-hour stoppage from noon (10am BST). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. Bubbling anger against Greece's austerity programme will hit the streets of Athens today. Labour unions are holding their fourth general strike of 2013, with demonstrations planned for the Greek capital. The walkout comes as MPs debate the latest austerity measures agreed with Greece's lenders, including cutting 15,000 public sector workers from the payroll. Those layoffs are the price of Greece's latest bailout loans, but the unions say they will bring further suffering to a country locked in recession since the early days of the financial crisis. As usual on these occasions, we're expecting disruption to transport links, government services, and a protest march to the parliament at Syntagma Square. MPs are due to vote on the austerity measures on Wednesday night, so today's strike is an opportunity to change some minds within the parliament. The Athens government has already been trying to assuage the anger. As Kathimerini reports this morning: In various statements to the media, government officials sought to appease fears of impending layoffs. Public Order Minister Nikos Dendias told Skai that the aim was for all municipal police officers to be reposted within the ranks of the Greek Police force. Health Minister Adonis Georgiadis told Mega television channel that more than 1,000 hospital staff scheduled to join a mobility scheme for civil servants by the end of the year would only be subject to reduced wages for two months ahead of their transfer to other posts, insisting that none of them would be laid off. But that may not prevent workers taking to the streets, or from continuing their sit-ins at some municipal buildings. The schoolteachers union, for example, is reportedly planning legal action over plans to put teachers staff into Greece's new 'mobility scheme' -- where workers are paid less and can be more easily laid off. We'll have full analysis of the situation shortly, from Athens. Also today... \u2022 Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy remains under pressure over the slush fund scandal (after failing to resign yesterday). \u2022 UK inflation and German ZEW confidence data is due out later this morning. \u2022 And in the corporate world, Goldman Sachs reports its results (as former trader Fabrice Tourre defends himself against fraud charges.

      "bodyText": "Barbeque weather is here and the likes of B&amp;Q could benefit, with the DIY group's owner Kingfisher one of the in demand shares in a subdued market. Recent signs of buoyancy in UK housing should also help the business, while a recent tax case victory in France should allow Kingfisher to return more cash to shareholders, analysts believe. The company has climbed to the top of the FTSE 100, up 9.4p to 388.4p, following a series of positive broker notes ahead of a trading update next week. A day after a buy recommendation from Jefferies, Nomura has moved from reduce to neutral while Deutsche Bank has lifted its price target from 325p to 360p. The bank said: We expect the company to report solid trading for the 10 week period, including the strongest like for like at B&amp;Q for over three years. Consensus profit forecasts look further underpinned by recent currency moves, which add around \u00a35m to our full year forecasts. The last few weeks has seen improved UK housing data points, a favourable tax judgment and the prospect of capacity withdrawal in Poland, all of which help to justify the recent rise in the share price. We now factor in a buyback programme starting this year and raise our target price. Retain hold on valuation. Overall though the FTSE 100 is down 7.01 points at 6579.10, as investors pause for breath after recent rises. A host of data is out during the day, but the main focus is likely to be US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony to congress on Wednesday and Thursday. The markets have reacted with volatile movements every time they believe Bernanke is hinting at an end to the Fed's $85 a month bond buying programme, and this week's comments will be scrutinised for any suggestions about the future of QE.

    "webTitle": "Energy sector should face independent review, says Which?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government needs to launch an independent review of the energy sector similar to the Vickers report on banking as part of a bid to break the dominance of the big six power providers and rein in soaring household bills, according to Which? The consumer group is also calling for Centrica, SSE and others to be prevented from controlling both power stations and retail supply businesses while it also wants all wholesale power deals to be published by independent brokers and closely monitored by the watchdog Ofgem. These and other recommendations are contained in a scathing new report, titled The Imbalance of Power: Wholesale Costs and Retail Prices, which followed a year-long investigation and unearthed conflicts of interest, a lack of transparency and flimsy price reporting systems which have left consumers with \"little confidence\" that gas and electricity charges are fair. The Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator and Ofgem are already looking into allegations of wholesale gas market rigging highlighted in the Guardian, but the consumer group claims this problem and others mean a wider commission is urgently required. \"Hard-pressed consumers consistently tell us that the spiralling cost of their energy bills is one of their top financial concerns. Suppliers often blame price rises on an increase in wholesale costs, but it is impossible to work out if the price we're paying is a fair one,\" said the Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd. \"The government and the regulator are taking steps to reform the retail market and increase efficiency but more must be done. The government should commit to an independent review of the wholesale market and also ensure that new energy generation is properly scrutinised and brought forward at the lowest cost for consumers,\" he added. Evidence obtained by Which? suggests that allowing companies to put supply and generation businesses under a single management and governance structure impedes competition and increases consumer prices. Ring-fencing supply business and increasing their separation from the upstream power businesses \"should counter the natural conflict of interests within these large vertically integrated energy companies\". This would encourage new independent power providers to come in and help supply businesses seek out better prices for their customers. It should also improve customer trust both in the price and underlying market while leading to greater volumes being traded on the open market. This in turn should improve the quality and quantity of price information that can be transferred into more robust price indices, argues the consumer group, which believes that much better quality and quantities of publicly available wholesale market information is desperately needed. Until this happens, Which? says \"it will not be possible to assess the real level of competition in wholesale markets, evaluate the efficiency of retail prices and design the most effective interventions\". Which? wants to ensure that the majority of wholesale energy trading that is done bilaterally and \"over-the-counter\" rather than through formal exchanges is more transparent. The prices for gas and electricity deals have up until now largely only been collected and published by journalists working for price reporting agencies (PRA) such as Platts, Argus and ICIS-Heren. But this system has been badly undermined by revelations from a former ICIS price reporter published by the Guardian that the system is open to abuse while oil companies such as Total of France have told a recent investigation by IOSCO, an association of organisations that regulate the world's securities and futures markets, that PRA prices are unreliable. Which? is also keen that Ofgem is much more actively involved in the comprehensive monitoring of the wholesale market and of its relationship with retail prices. The big six have repeatedly justified retail prices being increased because of changes in the wholesale values but critics say this link is not always clear to discern. In a separate report \u2013 The Imbalance of Power: The Challenge of Decarbonisation \u2013 the consumer group argues that the government is not doing enough to ensure that power companies do not use government policies in place to tackle climate change as an unfair excuse to pass on household bill increases.",

      "body": "<p>The government needs to launch an independent review of the energy sector similar to the Vickers report on banking as part of a bid to break the dominance of the big six power providers and rein in soaring household bills, according to Which?</p> <p>The consumer group is also calling for Centrica, SSE and others to be prevented from controlling both power stations and retail supply businesses while it also wants all wholesale power deals to be published by independent brokers and closely monitored by the watchdog Ofgem.</p> <p>These and other recommendations are contained in a scathing new report, titled The Imbalance of Power: Wholesale Costs and Retail Prices, which followed a year-long investigation and unearthed conflicts of interest, a lack of transparency and flimsy price reporting systems which have left consumers with \"little confidence\" that gas and electricity charges are fair.</p> <p>The Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator and Ofgem are already looking into allegations of wholesale gas market rigging highlighted in the Guardian, but the consumer group claims this problem and others mean a wider commission is urgently required.</p> <p>\"Hard-pressed consumers consistently tell us that the spiralling cost of their energy bills is one of their top financial concerns. Suppliers often blame price rises on an increase in wholesale costs, but it is impossible to work out if the price we're paying is a fair one,\" said the Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd.</p> <p>\"The government and the regulator are taking steps to reform the retail market and increase efficiency but more must be done. The government should commit to an independent review of the wholesale market and also ensure that new energy generation is properly scrutinised and brought forward at the lowest cost for consumers,\" he added.</p> <p>Evidence obtained by Which? suggests that allowing companies to put supply and generation businesses under a single management and governance structure impedes competition and increases consumer prices.</p> <p>Ring-fencing supply business and increasing their separation from the upstream power businesses \"should counter the natural conflict of interests within these large vertically integrated energy companies\".</p> <p>This would encourage new independent power providers to come in and help supply businesses seek out better prices for their customers. It should also improve customer trust both in the price and underlying market while leading to greater volumes being traded on the open market.</p> <p>This in turn should improve the quality and quantity of price information that can be transferred into more robust price indices, argues the consumer group, which believes that much better quality and quantities of publicly available wholesale market information is desperately needed. Until this happens, Which? says \"it will not be possible to assess the real level of competition in wholesale markets, evaluate the efficiency of retail prices and design the most effective interventions\".</p> <p>Which? wants to ensure that the majority of wholesale energy trading that is done bilaterally and \"over-the-counter\" rather than through formal exchanges is more transparent.</p> <p>The prices for gas and electricity deals have up until now largely only been collected and published by journalists working for price reporting agencies (PRA) such as Platts, Argus and ICIS-Heren.</p> <p>But this system has been badly undermined by revelations from a former ICIS price reporter published by the Guardian that the system is open to abuse while oil companies such as Total of France have told a recent investigation by IOSCO, an association of organisations that regulate the world's securities and futures markets, that PRA prices are unreliable.</p> <p>Which? is also keen that Ofgem is much more actively involved in the comprehensive monitoring of the wholesale market and of its relationship with retail prices. The big six have repeatedly justified retail prices being increased because of changes in the wholesale values but critics say this link is not always clear to discern.</p> <p>In a separate report \u2013 The Imbalance of Power: The Challenge of Decarbonisation \u2013 the consumer group argues that the government is not doing enough to ensure that power companies do not use government policies in place to tackle climate change as an unfair excuse to pass on household bill increases.</p>",

The company hopes that bringing back the brand that built its US business will fuel growth in emerging markets with a new generation of car buyers. The reimagined Datsun, a five-seat hatchback, will go on sale in India next year for under 400,000 rupees (A$7277). It will also be sold in Indonesia and Russia, with the company saying its offerings will be tailored to each market in terms of price and size. In India, the English-language promotional website for the car describes it as the \"badge of the risers\", an appeal to aspirational first-time car buyers. \"The drivetrain is designed specifically to suit the local environment, eliminating any stress or complexity for the risers to go forth,\" the website says. Nissan Motor Co is hoping the comeback of one of its defining brands will herald the same rapid expansion that the Datsun provided when it hit American showrooms more than 50 years ago. The Datsun was discontinued globally, starting in 1981, to unify the model line-up under the Nissan brand. Nissan also makes Infiniti luxury models. Faced with stagnating sales in established markets such as Japan and Europe, most global car makers have their eyes on fast-growing developing countries that also include China, Mexico and Brazil. The Nissan CEO, Carlos Ghosn, said on Monday in New Delhi that first-time car buyers in places such as India want the best car they can get at a price within their reach. \"We are responding to that with the return of Datsun,\" Ghosn said. India's population of 1.2 billion is a lure for car makers hoping to ring up big sales numbers, albeit with cheaper prices and lower profit margins. But the Datsun enters the Indian market at a tough time. Sales of passenger cars fell by 10% in the April to June quarter from the previous year, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. Indian consumer spending has been hit by an economic slowdown and high interest rates that make car loans less affordable.
