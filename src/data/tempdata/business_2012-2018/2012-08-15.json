    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The cash machines in Santiago are running out of money, but it is not a run on the banks; shoppers in Chile are simply spending peso notes faster than the automated tellers can provide them. New skyscrapers are rising up in Bogot\u00e1 to create the office and retail space needed by a growing economy. Mexico \u2013 the new darling of foreign investors \u2013 is outstripping GDP forecasts. Brazil, which overtook the UK as the world's sixth biggest economy last year, has just announced a $66bn (\u00a342bn) stimulus plan in addition to the money it will splash out in preparation for the 2014 World Cup and the Olympics in 2016. The economic mood music in Latin America for most of this year could hardly have been more of a contrast from that of the EU, mired in financial crisis, depressed by austerity, and dipping back into recession. Latin America is now being retuned, as most nations expect slower but still solid growth, and some prepare to tap extensive reserves to spend their way out of a global downturn. Their ability to withstand the coming storm will have long-term implications for perceptions of a region that was until recently a byword for financial turbulence, irresponsible spending and whimsical policies. Recently, many of the region's governments have been praised by the UN, IMF and World Bank for building strong reserves and maintaining generally low levels of public debt. This gives them more scope to open the fiscal stimulus taps when the economy starts to flag, as Brazil did on Wednesday with the announcement of a R$133bn (\u00a342bn) stimulus package. If they can avoid the worst impacts of the international crisis without sinking into debt \u2013 as most nations here did in 2008 \u2013 it would reinforce a growing reputation for prudent economic management. Several strong years of growth in the strongest performing economies have created a visible momentum. In Santiago, soaring housing prices, hundreds of new restaurants and thickets of cranes on the skyline suggest the Chilean economy has coasted through the early stages of the latest crisis. Car sales soared so high last year that at one point the government ran out of licence plates and was forced to issue cardboard substitutes while hastily stamping out another round of metal license plates. With an estimated GDP growth this year of 4.5%, plus hefty government reserves, Chile is prepared to weather potential fallout from Europe. \"We have a pretty comfortable position to face challenges in 2012,\" budget director Rosanna Costa told reporters in Santiago this year. The government sits on an estimated $14bn stabilisation fund that can be used to stimulate the economy via public works projects or cash infusions, as needed. Peru is also enjoying steady expansion, while Venezuela, buoyed by oil sales and a pre-election spending binge by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, is expected to grow by more than 5%, though its ability to pay its bills will depend on high oil prices. There are some significant exceptions to these trends. Argentina's economy has ground to a halt in the wake of the nationalisation of local assets owned by Spanish oil company YPF, indicating the still strong influence of global financial markets in Latin America. Even so, the region is expected to grow by 3-4% this year \u2013 a bonanza compared with the depression that afflicts the Latin nations in the old world. Portugal, Spain and Italy were among the worst-performing nations when the EU announced this week that the GDP of the eurozone fell 0.2% in the latest quarter. The contrasts are striking. While Spain has been begging for bailouts, Juan Carlos Echeverry, the finance minister of its former colony Colombia, this year boasted his government \"didn't need more revenue\". Thanks to rising rates of inward investment, falling unemployment and annual growth of 4.5% for more than a decade, his state's finances are thought to be in good shape to withstand the fallout from Europe. Although the mood has darkened in recent months, new symbols of affluence are being built. Colombia is erecting its tallest skyscraper, the 66-storey BD Bacat\u00e1 building, which will house a shopping mall, office space and up-market apartments. The Spanish property tycoon behind the project, Venerando Lamelas, said he was moving with the times. \"The European market is not doing well. Latin America is very important and within Latin America the best market is Colombia,\" he told a local newspaper. Others are following the opportunities across the Atlantic. Gonzalo Rodriguez recently gave up his job in Spain as a bond-market trader and moved to Brazil to work for an energy company designing power transmission lines for wind farms. \"I'm not earning as much here as I did in Spain, but I'm thinking five years ahead,\" the 25-year-old said in Copacabana. \"There is 100% more growth potential in Brazilian energy than in Spanish banks. There are lots of talented people in Spain not finding jobs. Here, it is the opposite. They don't have enough qualified people.\" Such optimism will be tested in the months ahead. Brazil has been hit harder than any other country by the downturn overseas \u2013 particularly weakening Chinese demand for commodities. It is likely to grow more slowly this year \u2013 about 2-3% \u2013 than any of the other big regional economies, prompting President Dilma Rousseff to unveil Wednesday's hefty stimulus package. Unlike in the past, however, it has the money to spend. Brazil's international reserves have swollen from $38bn in 2002 to more than $370bn, which is a substantial war chest to fend off global crisis. \"In years past, when the world sneezed, we caught pneumonia. That's no longer the case,\" Rousseff said this year. \"I can assure you, Brazil is 100%, 200%, 300% ready.\" Many economists question whether Brazil and the region as a whole will prove as resilient this time. Strong demand from China for soy, oil, copper and other commodities helped Latin America coast through the 2008-09 crisis. This time, with China slowing, it will have to dig deeper into its reserves. Although government finances are far stronger than they were in the 80s and 90s, the big question is whether it has invested enough in human capital. \"Important jobs here in Brazil are now being filled by Europeans, especially from Spain and Portugal,\" said Nelson de Sousa, a finance lecturer at management school Ibmec. \"We have not put enough into education and training. That is our great difficulty and one that is very different from the problems faced by Europe. \"The Brazilian government spends a lot, but badly. Dilma is aware of that, but there is a big difference between knowing what to do and being able to do it.\" If she \u2013 and other leaders in the region \u2013 succeed, however, a lot more than the Olympic torch may pass this year from Europe to Latin America. \u2022 The headline was changed on 16 August 2012",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When Sir Richard Branson lost his second attempt to run the National Lottery in 2000, he lambasted the conservative instincts of the British establishment. Decision-makers would always choose the \"more of the same\" option rather than take a risk with something new, he said. \"You've got to have a country where people are willing to take risks. It is far, far tougher to be an entrepreneur here than it is in America.\" Now, 12 years later, the billionaire founder of the Virgin empire is on the attack again after the government followed his advice and tried something different \u2013 with a company run by an American, to boot. As the underbidder for the west coast route, Branson found himself in the unusual position of criticising ministers for displaying an excess of the risk-taking zeal that has driven his success. Whether it is a fault of Britain's hidebound business environment or a reflection of where Branson sees a money-making opportunity, many of the tycoon's UK ventures have involved close interaction with the government of the day, from seeking ministerial backing for Heathrow landing slots to buying Northern Rock from the state for \u00a3747m. It is a relationship that has waxed and waned but has delivered for both sides. Even when Branson leaves the rail business at the end of the year, he will have a strong presence on the British high street after Virgin Money's acquisition of Northern Rock, while his Virgin Care business has signed a contract to provide community health services for the NHS in Surrey and Devon. For all the accusations of government \"insanity\" for not renewing Virgin's west coast mainline franchise, Branson is not going to sever ties with the UK or the establishment soon. However, one branding expert says the west coast loss is one of the worst he has suffered. \"It is one of the first times that Virgin has been told no and that is a moment of truth for them,\" said Graham Hales, the UK boss of the consultancy Interbrand. \"The brand has sailed through life pretty unassailably and has always succeeded in having a lot of public goodwill behind it.\" Even without Virgin Trains, Branson has other strong brands, from Virgin Active gyms and the Virgin Media cable business to the Virgin Atlantic airline. Hales adds that, in many ways, Virgin Trains was an outrider for the group because rail is not a typical vehicle for the Virgin brand. \"It was not really part of the family,\" he said. \"The brand will continue to have its property in other markets. It is always looking to champion the consumer and that's where it is at its best. I don't think it did that convincingly for rail. Virgin is superb when it is reinventing categories, siding with the consumer or poking fun at po-faced competitors. None of that happened in rail.\" Virgin would disagree, pointing to a doubling of passenger numbers during its ownership of the franchise and quirky marketing campaigns that helped make it the most well-known rail brand in Britain. Branson is adamant that he will not return to the rail industry under the current franchising system, a statement that could be questioned given his ongoing fascination with the National Lottery. But one rail industry source said that being runnerup to two lofty franchise bids \u2013 in 2005 and 2007 Virgin lost out on the east coast line to two bids that ultimately collapsed \u2013 represents the end of the journey. \"I think he means it. If you have come second twice in a row on two big franchises and you see the winning bid default, why would you continue to participate in the process?\" The same source adds, however, that Virgin's entrepreneurial flair had bruised relations with the Department for Transport. It is widely accepted within rail industry circles that a renegotiation of the west coast franchise in 2006 left a bitter aftertaste for some at the DfT. Virgin was thought to have got away with too good a deal. \"Virgin Trains has not been liked by the DfT because the department holds the view that it has been outsmarted and outgunned in commercial negotiations in previous years. That resentment is not as strong today as it has been in the past, but it lingered on and you wonder if the [west coast] decision had an element of revenge being served cold.\" The franchising process is so rigorous that even sources close to Virgin doubt that rancour over the 2006 negotiation played any role in the loss of the west coast route. The precise financial cost to the Virgin empire is impossible to fathom, given that Branson presides over a conglomerate of about 400 operations that are ultimately owned by offshore trusts and overseas holding companies. Some of the biggest names, including Virgin Media, are not even wholly owned and Virgin Trains is co-owned with Stagecoach, the Scottish public transport group. But even the most basic contrast with Virgin Atlantic underlines the importance of the trains business to Branson. Last year, the airline carried 5.4 million passengers compared with the train company's 31 million, while the carrier posted a pre-tax loss of \u00a380m last year compared with a pre-tax profit of \u00a341m at Virgin Trains. Whether or not the rail business is a perfect fit in terms of the Virgin brand, it is an important contributor to the empire's coffers. However, the west coast business has seen its pre-tax profits decline every year since they peaked at \u00a3105m in 2009. So, while sales have increased year by year from \u00a3336m in 2001 to \u00a3929m in the year to March 2012, pre-tax profits are virtually unchanged at \u00a341m in 2012 compared with \u00a338m in 2001. Franchise profitability has been extremely erratic, reflecting disruption compensation from Network Rail, the owner of the tracks and stations, and changes in the franchise agreement with the government. Rail is not an industry where entrepreneurs can go about unfettered. As a consequence, over the past 15 years the performance of Virgin Trains has ranged from a \u00a313m pre-tax loss in 2006 to the \u00a3105m pre-tax profit recorded in 2009, although that is a healthy return for any rail franchise. Virgin argues in turn that the profits and subsequent dividend payments are an appropriate return for sticking with, and investing in, a London-to-Glasgow route that was bedevilled by poor performance while it underwent a multibillion-pound upgrade for much of the franchise. Although the wider Virgin Group may incur an asset writedown as a consequence of the west coast decision, the cessation of dividend payments from Virgin Trains will be a much bigger blow. Virgin Rail Group Holdings has paid dividends every year since 2004 apart from 2006. In the past 10 years, Virgin Rail has paid out \u00a3381.7m split between Virgin Group, a 51% shareholder, and Stagecoach, which owns the remaining 49%. A \u00a324m dividend in 2011 was increased to \u00a329m in 2012. And there is some compensation to come, despite FirstGroup's unexpected triumph. Even though the franchise has been lost, Virgin Rail is still paying a dividend of at least \u00a323m in the year to March 2013. Speaking after he failed to secure the National Lottery in 2000, Branson said: \"The dilemma is, do you bow out gracefully or do you fight?\" Whenever a door shuts on Branson, he seems to force another open. It is the end of the line for Virgin Trains but Branson and his myriad interests will remain a commercial force in Britain.",

      "bodyText": "A leading US senator has asked other regulators to find the \"backbone\" to take action against Standard Chartered following the London-based bank's $340m (\u00a3220m) settlement in New York over sanctions breaches with Iran. Carl Levin said on Wednesday that the steps taken by the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) that forced Standard Chartered to agree to the civil penalty showed that it was not necessary to go through years of negotiation. \"The agency also showed that holding a bank accountable for past misconduct doesn't need to take years of negotiation over the size of the penalty; it simply requires a regulator with backbone to act,\" said Levin, who last month accused HSBC of a \"pervasively polluted\" culture in laundering money for drug cartels and terrorists in a gruelling public hearing. Standard Chartered's share price rose on the FTSE 100 on Wednesday even as the bank attempted to broker a settlement with other regulators. It could face further fines from the US justice department and the US treasury, which are both investigating sanctions breaches that allegedly took place between 2001 and 2007. Settlements could come as soon as next week. Annemarie McAvoy, a former federal prosecutor who is now a professor at Fordham Law School in New York, said the pressure was on after the DFS moved alone to level charges. \"Given that New York extracted $340m, the other regulators will undoubtedly have to come up with similar resolutions,\" she said. Even though the bank's shares rose 4% to \u00a314.26, chief executive Peter Sands remains under pressure, as they have slumped from \u00a316 since the DFS made the damning charges last Monday. He is believed to have resumed the family holiday he broke off to tackle the DFS claims. Benjamin Lawsky, head of the DFS, claimed that Standard Chartered schemed to hide 60,000 transactions, valued at about $250bn, that breached sanctions with Iran. Sands admitted to only 300 breaches, with a value of about $14m. Anthony Sabino, a law professor at St John's University in New York, said Standard Chartered was \"far from out of the woods\", but he expected federal investigations to continue in a more low-key manner. \"Without a doubt the justice department and treasury will want to deal with this quickly. But I suspect they will want it done in a quieter manner,\" he said. He said Lawsky had acted \"like the Lone Ranger\". Analysts at UBS predicted the shares would rise: \"The aggregate of this fine, plus any additional recompense to other regulators, could total less than 1% of Standard Chartered's equity and the DFS fine represents around 6% of our current earnings forecast for Standard Chartered, suggesting the company will be able to absorb this cost and still deliver a 10th successive year of record profits. \"New York's regulatory action sends a strong message that the United States will not tolerate foreign banks giving rogue nations like Iran hidden access to the US financial system.\"",

As part of the surprise shakeup, Tiner, a former regulator, is leaving and will be replaced by Andy Briggs, who currently heads Friends Life. Mike Biggs remains chairman. Resolution, which was launched by Clive Cowdery to buy up other life insurance firms in 2008, ditched any plans for further acquisitions and a flotation of Friends Life.

    "webTitle": "Totnes: the town that declared war on global capitalism", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It's a balmy Tuesday evening in Totnes, the small Devon town that sits just below the south-western tip of the M5. Outside the Methodist church hall, a hand-drawn notice simply says \"Adios Costa\". Inside, around 45 people are having an animated discussion about the imminent arrival of the ever-expanding coffee chain. There is a lot of talk about a failure of democracy, and the emptiness of what politicians call \"Localism\" \u2013 but, more interestingly, an emphasis on what might happen when the town's newest arrival actually opens its doors. \"The idea is to be prepared,\" says one of the people behind tonight's gathering, with some excitement. \"So that when they get here, things are organised.\" One man suggests regularly visiting Costa, ordering tap water, and then drinking it very slowly. A woman offers to paste up anti-Costa posters on the chain's windows, doggedly replacing them whenever they're removed. A couple of people who live across the street from Costa's proposed new outlet say they'll hang protest banners and there is a warmly received proposal of an official day of mourning, \"because we've lost our democracy\". And on it goes: how about a debate in parliament? Or a vote of no confidence in the local council? Or a simple boycott? Welcome, then, to another chapter in the ongoing battle between places that pride themselves on their local character, and the great stomping boot of multinational capitalism. That it is happening in Totnes (population: 7,500) is hardly surprising: long renowned as a byword for sustainable living and imaginative local politics, it also the home of the Transition Towns movement, focused not just on the way that people and places use fossil fuels, but how to make local economies more resilient by encouraging independent business, and fighting the kind of big interests that tend to take out more than they put in. Their most famous innovation is the Totnes Pound, a home-grown currency that is accepted by more than 70 local businesses. Totnes's local economy looks to be in reasonable health, which is surely down to the fact that it is about as far from being what we now call a \"clone town\" as could be imagined. The local record shop, Drift, is mind-bogglingly great: the kind of place that you'd think was amazing if you found it in New York. The quality and diversity of restaurants is amazing. Most pertinently, the town has 42 independently run outlets that serve coffee, and \u2013 so far \u2013 not a single branch of any of the big caffeine-selling multiples. Now, though, Costa \u2013 whose most visible slogan remains \"Saving the world from mediocre coffee\" \u2013 is on its way, as part of programme of expansion that will look either worryingly aggressive or admirably ambitious, depending on your point of view. Certainly, it seems to be bucking the prevailing trend of our flatlining economy, opening scores of new outlets while independent coffee shops are truly feeling the pinch. A fully owned subsidiary of the food and hospitality conglomerate Whitbread, it currently operates 1,400 British outlets, and recently announced plans for 350 more. Thanks also to a snowballing presence in petrol stations, pubs and motorway services, its logo is becoming inescapable, which is exactly the point: the chief executive, Andy Harrison, has talked about increasing the number of branches to 2,000, and thus making them ubiquitous. \"People really don't want to walk very far for a coffee,\" he has said. \"We can have them a couple of hundred yards apart on a really busy high street, then another at a retail park and another at the station.\" The fact that Starbucks remains synonymous with the more rapacious aspects of modern business seems to have blinded people to what Costa is doing. But as proved by similar battles in the West Country seaside town of Burnham-on-Sea, Bishops Waltham in Hampshire and the Suffolk resort of Southwold, it is Costa that may soon turn into the biggest signifier \u2013 in the UK, at least \u2013 for the tensions between local communities and big chains. In Southwold, in fact, Tuesday night saw a successful appeal by Costa against a previous planning decision that had stopped them opening there, greeted with such fury that 100 people were ordered to leave that night's planning hearing. Such, say anti-Costa campaigners, are the same basic outlines as you see in battles against the big supermarkets: passionate locals who fear the places where they live being laid waste, a massive corporation that wants to expand \u2013 and local politicians who tend to run scared, because of the prohibitive costs of locking horns with such huge companies. The Totnes story goes something like this. In February 2010, a local wholefood business called Greenlife moved out of the High Street, to new premises on the town's market square. There were initial rumblings about the site being taken by Oxfam, before a new landlord called London and Western Holdings bought the shop, and it was eventually announced that Costa would be moving in, and opening a 70-seat cafe, in a part of town that regularly swarms with visitors. This, presumably is why they want a piece of the action. \"The bottom of the hill is where most of the tourists arrive,\" says Frances Northrop, the manager of Transition Town Totnes (or TTT), and one of the prime movers in the anti-Costa campaign. \"They come in on the river, or by train, or into the car park there. So they'll come straight in, and they'll see a Costa Coffee. And if people are in a new place, a lot of people think: 'I'm not going to try the unknown \u2013 I'm going to go somewhere that I recognise.'\" In response to unconfirmed rumours that Costa would be moving in, Northrop and scores of people with similar convictions got to work, bigging up Totnes's cafe society. In May, there was a coffee festival, which offered prizes for baristas, the places where they work, and the slippery discipline of \"coffee art\" (putting images in the froth). Those opposed to the arrival of a chain pasted up posters modelled on the publicity material for the movie of Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting, recast as \"Clonespotting\". Meanwhile, a petition against the arrival of any big coffee business was in circulation, and quickly amassed 5,749 signatures \u2013 75% of which, say the anti-Costa camp, came from people from Totnes, or its surrounding areas. In time, the town council voted in support of the campaign, along with all of Totnes's district councillors. The local MP is Sarah Wollaston, the non-conformist Tory most renowned for her opposition to Andrew Lansley's changes to the NHS \u2013 and she is in full accord. \"The strength of feeling on this issue has been evident and it is not too late for Costa to look at local opinion and decide to take their business elsewhere,\" she recently said. Plenty of locals say the Costa controversy is proof of one of the serial disappointments associated with the coalition government: there has been no end of Westminster noise about \"localism\" \u2013 but on the ground, the blanding-out of our towns, villages and cities seems to be accelerating, against local opposition. What was soon named the No To Costa campaign zeroed in on the legal obligation to consider planning applications on the basis of what they will do to a town's \"vibrancy and vitality\", and claimed that if Costa got what they wanted, Totnes would suffer. But on 1 August, the planning committee of South Hams district council approved Costa's plans by 17 votes to six. As Costa's local opponents endlessly point out, only four of the councillors who voted actually represent the town. \"It wasn't just about the fact that we didn't want a large chain, or not damaging our pretty market town \u2013 it's actually that they're like Tesco,\" says Northrop. \"They're an aggressive, extractive industry. We've got 42 coffee outlets, all independently owned, a lot of which are struggling, like anywhere else \u2013 and if you bring in a retail unit with the buying power and familiarity of Costa, which is the size of three coffee shops, you're damaging not only those independent businesses, who might go out of business, but their supply chains: growers, producers, drinks suppliers.\" When I contact it for its take on the Totnes story, a Costa spokeswoman tells me: \"Totnes is a thriving tourist town and we appreciate that it has a strong reputation for supporting independent retailers.\" She says the company \"would like to reassure the people of Totnes that Costa won't be a threat to the dozens of coffee shops that are already there, but will aim to complement the local offering and support the local community.\" She concedes that \"it's disappointing that there is so much objection\", but says that \"we simply want to add to the vibrancy of the town and support the local community.\" Costa, she claims, will boost the town's character \"by adding vibrancy, complementing what Totnes currently offers.\" When I ask her for a response on the question of local supply chains, her reply runs thus: \"Costa coffee prides itself in using numerous suppliers, large and small, across the UK to produce the products it sells within its stores. For example, we work with a family run bakery to produce our cakes, with dedicated dairy farmers for our milk and use British meat in our savoury lines. At a time when many businesses are closing, we are one of the success stories of British business, creating jobs right across the UK.\" I spend nine hours in Totnes, sped on my way by the borderline anxious buzz that comes from endless cups of coffee, served by people who are, not entirely surprisingly, worried by the prospect of Costa's arrival. Their stories tend to have a great deal in common: a good deal of the town's cafe-owners are people new to the trade, who have said goodbye to regular jobs, or time spent abroad, and staked their livelihoods on Totnes's unique culture. At the freshly opened Curator cafe, I meet 38-year-old Matteo Lamaro, a native of Ancona in eastern Italy, who moved here after a long spell as youth worker in central London. Lamaro's cafe looks posh, but is way cheaper than the multiples: a regular cappuccino is \u00a32, and a slice of his delicious marble cake comes in at \u00a31.50: at Costa, the equivalent prices are \u00a32.45 each. \"Costa will affect the ambience Totnes has,\" he says. \"This is an independent kind of place, offering something different from \u2026 normality.\" And will its arrival affect his trade? \"It depends on the tourists. Costa is a known place, isn't it, isn't it? So if they want a coffee somewhere they know, rather than a place that actually offers good coffee \u2026 that's the main risk.\" At the top of the town, the bustling Green cafe takes its name from 46-year-old Ivan Green, who moved here with his family after living in southern Brittany. They live above the business, and he rises at 5am each day to bake 90% of the bread, cakes and pies that are on sale. He is already preparing for the malign effects of Costa's opening, having done up the flat that sits behind the cafe, and rented it out. \"The problem I have with the multinationals,\" he says, \"is that it's just not fair competition.\" The more he talks, the more outraged he sounds: like a lot of locals, he says that one of his big fears is Costa serving notice that Totnes is ready to be colonised, and sparking the arrival of Caffe Nero, Subway and all the rest. Over the road, Martin Turner, 42, runs the Tangerine Tree caf\u00e9. He's been in Totnes for four and a half years, having run the catering department at the HQ of the Met Office, in Exeter. \"It'll have an effect on footfall coming up through the town,\" he says. \"We've got a lot of loyal customers, but it could stop people coming up here: 70 is a lot of seats. The other thing is, it could put rents up. So we'll definitely notice it.\" I hear the same sentiments at the Fat Lemons cafe \u2013 which is Totnes incarnate, purveying vegetarian and gluten-free food, with artwork from the Who's Quadrophenia hanging on the wall in the gents \u2013 and Olsen, a Scandinavian-themed place run by a half-Danish local called Karl Rasmussen, who offers such treats as home-cured gravlax (\"with pickled beetroot, salad, Swedish crispbread and dill and mustard dressing\"), and octopus, potato and watercress salad. Two of his regulars are sitting just in front of the counter. \"We've got 42 coffee places,\" says Ann Rutherford, 71. \"Why do we need a 43rd?\" \"A coffee shop is where people meet,\" says 64-year-old Diana Cusack. \"We don't need Costa to give us a place to meet. We've got a surfeit of places in Totnes where people meet to talk. We're a talking town.\" They both say they'll go nowhere near Costa, but say they worry about its appeal to the town's youth, who might be drawn in by the prospect of \"two milkshakes and free Wi-Fi\". By way of walking off the effects of so much coffee, I decide to do a few unscientific vox pops \u2013 which is when I meet some of the people I've just been talking about. They're killing time in the market square and their lives, they tell me, are split between education, gap years and low-end jobs. On the face of it, they are the kind of people that Costa and their ilk specialise in attracting. Round here, though, it doesn't seem to be working. \"I think it's pretty bad,\" says Jesse Tighe, 18. \"We don't really need these chains.\" \"If you want to come to Totnes,\" reckons 18-year-old Finnegan Travers, \"you come to the independent places, don't you?\" What words, I wonder, do they associate with Costa Coffee? \"Shit,\" says one voice. \"Corporate,\" offers another. \"McDonald's,\" reckons a third. \"We're speaking for every young person here, I promise you. And older people,\" says Tighe. He glances up the street, towards a pub-cum-music-venue-cum-cafe called the Barrel House, and down towards the premises where Costa will soon pitch up. \"No one in Totnes wants this, do they?\"",

      "body": "<p>It's a balmy Tuesday evening in Totnes, the small Devon town that sits just below the south-western tip of the M5. Outside the Methodist church hall, a hand-drawn notice simply says \"Adios Costa\". Inside, around 45 people are having an animated discussion about the imminent arrival of the ever-expanding coffee chain. There is a lot of talk about a failure of democracy, and the emptiness of what politicians call \"Localism\" \u2013 but, more interestingly, an emphasis on what might happen when the town's newest arrival actually opens its doors.</p> <p>\"The idea is to be prepared,\" says one of the people behind tonight's gathering, with some excitement. \"So that when they get here, things are <em>organised</em>.\"</p> <p>One man suggests regularly visiting Costa, ordering tap water, and then drinking it very slowly. A woman offers to paste up anti-Costa posters on the chain's windows, doggedly replacing them whenever they're removed. A couple of people who live across the street from Costa's proposed new outlet say they'll hang protest banners and there is a warmly received proposal of an official day of mourning, \"because we've lost our democracy\". And on it goes: how about a debate in parliament? Or a vote of no confidence in the local council? Or a simple boycott?</p> <p>Welcome, then, to another chapter in the ongoing battle between places that pride themselves on their local character, and the great stomping boot of multinational capitalism. That it is happening in Totnes (population: 7,500) is hardly surprising: long renowned as a byword for sustainable living and imaginative local politics, it also the home of the Transition Towns movement, focused not just on the way that people and places use fossil fuels, but how to make local economies more resilient by encouraging independent business, and fighting the kind of big interests that tend to take out more than they put in. Their most famous innovation is the Totnes Pound, a home-grown currency that is accepted by more than 70 local businesses.</p> <p>Totnes's local economy looks to be in reasonable health, which is surely down to the fact that it is about as far from being what we now call a \"clone town\" as could be imagined. The local record shop, <a href=\"http://www.driftrecordshop.com/\" title=\"\">Drift</a>, is mind-bogglingly great: the kind of place that you'd think was amazing if you found it in New York. The quality and diversity of restaurants <em>is</em> amazing. Most pertinently, the town has 42 independently run outlets that serve coffee, and \u2013 so far \u2013 not a single branch of any of the big caffeine-selling multiples.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394789258\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/15/1345052682808/Anti-Costa-campaigner-Fra-008.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Costa campaigner, Frances Northrop\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-Costa campaigner, Frances Northrop Photograph: SWNS.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, though, Costa \u2013 whose most visible slogan remains \"Saving the world from mediocre coffee\" \u2013 is on its way, as part of programme of expansion that will look either worryingly aggressive or admirably ambitious, depending on your point of view. Certainly, it seems to be bucking the prevailing trend of our flatlining economy, opening scores of new outlets while independent coffee shops are truly feeling the pinch.</p> <p>A fully owned subsidiary of the food and hospitality conglomerate Whitbread, it currently operates 1,400 British outlets, and recently announced plans for 350 more. Thanks also to a snowballing presence in petrol stations, pubs and motorway services, its logo is becoming inescapable, which is exactly the point: the chief executive, Andy Harrison, has talked about increasing the number of branches to 2,000, and thus making them ubiquitous. \"People really don't want to walk very far for a coffee,\" he has said. \"We can have them a couple of hundred yards apart on a really busy high street, then another at a retail park and another at the station.\"</p> <p>The fact that Starbucks remains synonymous with the more rapacious aspects of modern business seems to have blinded people to what Costa is doing. But as proved by similar battles in the West Country seaside town of Burnham-on-Sea, Bishops Waltham in Hampshire and the Suffolk resort of Southwold, it is Costa that may soon turn into the biggest signifier \u2013 in the UK, at least \u2013 for the tensions between local communities and big chains.</p> <p>In Southwold, in fact, Tuesday night saw a successful appeal by Costa against a previous planning decision that had stopped them opening there, greeted with such fury that 100 people were ordered to leave that night's planning hearing. Such, say anti-Costa campaigners, are the same basic outlines as you see in battles against the big supermarkets: passionate locals who fear the places where they live being laid waste, a massive corporation that wants to expand \u2013 and local politicians who tend to run scared, because of the prohibitive costs of locking horns with such huge companies.</p> <p>The Totnes story goes something like this. In February 2010, a local wholefood business called Greenlife moved out of the High Street, to new premises on the town's market square. There were initial rumblings about the site being taken by Oxfam, before a new landlord called London and Western Holdings bought the shop, and it was eventually announced that Costa would be moving in, and opening a 70-seat cafe, in a part of town that regularly swarms with visitors.</p> <p>This, presumably is why they want a piece of the action. \"The bottom of the hill is where most of the tourists arrive,\" says Frances Northrop, the manager of Transition Town Totnes (or TTT), and one of the prime movers in the anti-Costa campaign. \"They come in on the river, or by train, or into the car park there. So they'll come straight in, and they'll see a Costa Coffee. And if people are in a new place, a lot of people think: 'I'm not going to try the unknown \u2013 I'm going to go somewhere that I recognise.'\"</p> <p>In response to unconfirmed rumours that Costa would be moving in, Northrop and scores of people with similar convictions got to work, bigging up Totnes's cafe society. In May, there was a coffee festival, which offered prizes for baristas, the places where they work, and the slippery discipline of \"coffee art\" (putting images in the froth). Those opposed to the arrival of a chain pasted up posters modelled on the publicity material for the movie of Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting, recast as \"Clonespotting\". Meanwhile, a petition against the arrival of any big coffee business was in circulation, and quickly amassed 5,749 signatures \u2013 75% of which, say the anti-Costa camp, came from people from Totnes, or its surrounding areas.</p> <p>In time, the town council voted in support of the campaign, along with all of Totnes's district councillors. The local MP is Sarah Wollaston, the non-conformist Tory most renowned for her opposition to Andrew Lansley's changes to the NHS \u2013 and she is in full accord. \"The strength of feeling on this issue has been evident and it is not too late for Costa to look at local opinion and decide to take their business elsewhere,\" she recently said. Plenty of locals say the Costa controversy is proof of one of the serial disappointments associated with the coalition government: there has been no end of Westminster noise about \"localism\" \u2013 but on the ground, the blanding-out of our towns, villages and cities seems to be accelerating, against local opposition.</p> <p>What was soon named the No To Costa campaign zeroed in on the legal obligation to consider planning applications on the basis of what they will do to a town's \"vibrancy and vitality\", and claimed that if Costa got what they wanted, Totnes would suffer. But on 1 August, the planning committee of South Hams district council approved Costa's plans by 17 votes to six. As Costa's local opponents endlessly point out, only four of the councillors who voted actually represent the town.</p> <p>\"It wasn't just about the fact that we didn't want a large chain, or not damaging our pretty market town \u2013 it's actually that they're like Tesco,\" says Northrop. \"They're an aggressive, extractive industry. We've got 42 coffee outlets, all independently owned, a lot of which are struggling, like anywhere else \u2013 and if you bring in a retail unit with the buying power and familiarity of Costa, which is the size of three coffee shops, you're damaging not only those independent businesses, who might go out of business, but their supply chains: growers, producers, drinks suppliers.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394789259\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/15/1345052926864/Campaigner-Matteo-Lamaro--008.jpg\" alt=\"Campaigner Matteo Lamaro of the Curator cafe\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Campaigner Matteo Lamaro of the Curator cafe. Photograph: SWNS.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I contact it for its take on the Totnes story, a Costa spokeswoman tells me: \"Totnes is a thriving tourist town and we appreciate that it has a strong reputation for supporting independent retailers.\" She says the company \"would like to reassure the people of Totnes that Costa won't be a threat to the dozens of coffee shops that are already there, but will aim to complement the local offering and support the local community.\"</p> <p>She concedes that \"it's disappointing that there is so much objection\", but says that \"we simply want to add to the vibrancy of the town and support the local community.\" Costa, she claims, will boost the town's character \"by adding vibrancy, complementing what Totnes currently offers.\"</p> <p>When I ask her for a response on the question of local supply chains, her reply runs thus: \"Costa coffee prides itself in using numerous suppliers, large and small, across the UK to produce the products it sells within its stores. For example, we work with a family run bakery to produce our cakes, with dedicated dairy farmers for our milk and use British meat in our savoury lines. At a time when many businesses are closing, we are one of the success stories of British business, creating jobs right across the UK.\"</p> <p>I spend nine hours in Totnes, sped on my way by the borderline anxious buzz that comes from endless cups of coffee, served by people who are, not entirely surprisingly, worried by the prospect of Costa's arrival. Their stories tend to have a great deal in common: a good deal of the town's cafe-owners are people new to the trade, who have said goodbye to regular jobs, or time spent abroad, and staked their livelihoods on Totnes's unique culture.</p> <p>At the freshly opened Curator cafe, I meet 38-year-old Matteo Lamaro, a native of Ancona in eastern Italy, who moved here after a long spell as youth worker in central London. Lamaro's cafe looks posh, but is way cheaper than the multiples: a regular cappuccino is \u00a32, and a slice of his delicious marble cake comes in at \u00a31.50: at Costa, the equivalent prices are \u00a32.45 each.</p> <p>\"Costa will affect the ambience Totnes has,\" he says. \"This is an independent kind of place, offering something different from \u2026 <em>normality</em>.\"</p> <p>And will its arrival affect his trade? \"It depends on the tourists. Costa is a known place, isn't it, isn't it? So if they want a coffee somewhere they know, rather than a place that actually offers good coffee \u2026 that's the main risk.\"</p> <p>At the top of the town, the bustling Green cafe takes its name from 46-year-old Ivan Green, who moved here with his family after living in southern Brittany. They live above the business, and he rises at 5am each day to bake 90% of the bread, cakes and pies that are on sale. He is already preparing for the malign effects of Costa's opening, having done up the flat that sits behind the cafe, and rented it out. \"The problem I have with the multinationals,\" he says, \"is that it's just not fair competition.\" The more he talks, the more outraged he sounds: like a lot of locals, he says that one of his big fears is Costa serving notice that Totnes is ready to be colonised, and sparking the arrival of Caffe Nero, Subway and all the rest.</p> <p>Over the road, Martin Turner, 42, runs the Tangerine Tree caf\u00e9. He's been in Totnes for four and a half years, having run the catering department at the HQ of the Met Office, in Exeter. \"It'll have an effect on footfall coming up through the town,\" he says. \"We've got a lot of loyal customers, but it could stop people coming up here: 70 is a lot of seats. The other thing is, it could put rents up. So we'll definitely notice it.\"</p> <p>I hear the same sentiments at the Fat Lemons cafe \u2013 which is Totnes incarnate, purveying vegetarian and gluten-free food, with artwork from the Who's Quadrophenia hanging on the wall in the gents \u2013 and Olsen, a Scandinavian-themed place run by a half-Danish local called Karl Rasmussen, who offers such treats as home-cured gravlax (\"with pickled beetroot, salad, Swedish crispbread and dill and mustard dressing\"), and octopus, potato and watercress salad.</p> <p>Two of his regulars are sitting just in front of the counter. \"We've got 42 coffee places,\" says Ann Rutherford, 71. \"Why do we need a 43rd?\"</p> <p>\"A coffee shop is where people meet,\" says 64-year-old Diana Cusack. \"We don't need Costa to give us a place to meet. We've got a surfeit of places in Totnes where people meet to talk. We're a talking town.\"</p> <p>They both say they'll go nowhere near Costa, but say they worry about its appeal to the town's youth, who might be drawn in by the prospect of \"two milkshakes and free Wi-Fi\".</p> <p>By way of walking off the effects of so much coffee, I decide to do a few unscientific vox pops \u2013 which is when I meet some of the people I've just been talking about. They're killing time in the market square and their lives, they tell me, are split between education, gap years and low-end jobs. On the face of it, they are the kind of people that Costa and their ilk specialise in attracting.</p> <p>Round here, though, it doesn't seem to be working. \"I think it's pretty bad,\" says Jesse Tighe, 18. \"We don't really need these chains.\"</p> <p>\"If you want to come to Totnes,\" reckons 18-year-old Finnegan Travers, \"you come to the independent places, don't you?\"</p> <p>What words, I wonder, do they associate with Costa Coffee?</p> <p>\"Shit,\" says one voice. \"Corporate,\" offers another. \"McDonald's,\" reckons a third.</p> <p>\"We're speaking for every young person here, I promise you. And older people,\" says Tighe. He glances up the street, towards a pub-cum-music-venue-cum-cafe called the Barrel House, and down towards the premises where Costa will soon pitch up. \"No one in Totnes wants this, do they?\"</p>",

Employment in the three months to June rose by more than 200,000, the sharpest quarterly increase for almost a quarter of a century. Confused? If so, you are not alone. The Bank of England, the City's finest and the cream of academia are scratching their heads as they try to work out what is going on because, historically, a fall in national output has meant lengthening dole queues. Three explanations have been put forward, none of them entirely convincing. The first is that the Office for National Statistics has been systematically understating growth in the economy. Activity is actually a lot stronger than the official data suggests, which would make the robust state of the labour market more plausible. But while there is a fair chance that the ONS will revise up growth in the third quarter and may find that the picture in earlier periods was not so gloomy as it originally thought, the best that can probably be said for the economy is that it has been moving sideways for the past year. It certainly has not been booming, which is the story from the employment figures. Perhaps, then, the ONS is wrong about the demand for labour being so robust. The puzzle would be solved if it could be shown that jobs were not being created at anything like the rate shown in the official figures, although the ONS's labour force survey uses a big sample of the population and relies on internationally agreed methodology. Finally, it is possible that falling productivity has been one of the many malign effects of the recession. If output per worker has dropped markedly, then it is possible to square rising employment with falling output, even though there has not yet been a really convincing explanation for why employees should have lost their skills or their motivation in such a profound way over the past five years. If both the GDP and the employment figures are correct, then productivity is dropping by more than 1% a quarter, a truly catastrophic performance. A more compelling narrative would go like this. The first phase of the recession in 2008-09 saw a shakeout of the labour market, with rising unemployment and lower employment. Some of the people who lost full-time jobs have found their way back into the labour market, but are working fewer hours in part-time jobs or in self employment. The number of people working part-time or in self-employment because they are unable to find full-time jobs is the highest since recent records began in 1992. For those workers still in full-time employment, the squeeze has come through pay rather than through hours worked.

The summer recess has ensured that bankers, though, in the scheme of things, have got off relatively lightly from politicians. The record-breaking fine for attempting to manipulate interest rates slapped on Barclays came just before the politicians headed off their holidays; the bank's boss Bob Diamond was forced out and MPs on the Treasury select committee took their opportunity to hold an impromptu inquiry on Libor. The results of the hearing, expected in the coming weeks, may not be easy reading for bankers or regulators . But HSBC and Standard Chartered largely escaped the scrutiny of politicians - although George Osborne appeared to try to help out Standard Chartered when he contacted his US counterpart to ensure the bank was treated fairly by all the US regulators investigating alleged sanction breaches with Iran. But it seems inevitable that the sector will not escape the glare of politicians for much longer. The consultation on the proposals set out by the Independent Commission on Banking closes on 6 September; now is the moment for politicians of all hues - particularly the Liberal Democrats - to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the implementation of the proposals by Sir John Vickers' commission. Then the party conference season starts. Imagine being a speech writer for Liberal Democrat Vince Cable, the business secretary in the coalition government, or Labour leader Ed Miliband? Cable has made no secret of his desire to get lending going through some kind of state-controlled lender - a fully nationalised Royal Bank of Scotland perhaps. Miliband is already considering whether a national investment bank should be set up to target lending into the economy. And then there is the Conservative MP, Andrew Tyrie, who is chairing the cross-party inquiry into banking. The deadline for his call for written evidence falls at the end of next week. His commission on banking standards will then begin its work in earnest. In amid this is the potential for new fines for attempted rigging of Libor. Sir Mervyn King, the Bank of England governor, also seems poised for action. At the weekend he wrote about the lessons for \"fair play\" that the banks could learn from the Olympics as once again he expounded the need for the Vickers' reforms. The Olympics showed, he wrote, that \"motivation does not come from financial incentives alone. Again, the financial sector has done us all a disservice in promoting the belief that massive financial compensation is necessary to motivate individuals\". Another cue, if it was needed, for the politicians to polish speeches about the need to reopen the debate about sweeping banking reform and devise fresh ideas about getting banks to help stimulate the economy.",

But HSBC and<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/14/standard-chartered-pay-fine-regulator\" title=\"\"> Standard Chartered </a>largely escaped the scrutiny of politicians - although George Osborne appeared to try to help out Standard Chartered when he contacted his US counterpart to ensure the bank was treated fairly by all the US regulators investigating alleged sanction breaches with Iran.</p> <p>But it seems inevitable that the sector will not escape the glare of politicians for much longer. The consultation on the proposals set out by the Independent Commission on Banking <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/fin_stability_regreform_icb.htm\" title=\"\">closes on 6 September</a>; now is the moment for politicians of all hues - particularly the Liberal Democrats - to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the implementation of <a href=\"http://bankingcommission.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">the proposals by Sir John Vickers' commission</a>.</p> <p>Then the party conference season starts. Imagine being a speech writer for Liberal Democrat Vince Cable, the business secretary in the coalition government, or Labour leader Ed Miliband? Cable has made no secret of his desire to get lending going through some kind of state-controlled lender - a fully nationalised Royal Bank of Scotland perhaps. Miliband is already considering whether a national investment bank should be set up to target lending into the economy.</p> <p>And then there is the Conservative MP, Andrew Tyrie, who is chairing the cross-party inquiry into banking. The deadline for his call for written evidence falls at the end of next week. His commission on banking standards will then begin its work in earnest.</p> <p>In amid this is the potential for new fines for attempted rigging of Libor.</p> <p>Sir Mervyn King, the Bank of England governor, also seems poised for action. At the weekend <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/13/mervyn-king-warns-olympic-effect-shortlived\" title=\"\">he wrote about the lessons for \"fair play\" </a>that the banks could learn from the Olympics as once again he expounded the need for the Vickers' reforms. The Olympics showed, he wrote, that \"motivation does not come from financial incentives alone. Again, the financial sector has done us all a disservice in promoting the belief that massive financial compensation is necessary to motivate individuals\". Another cue, if it was needed, for the politicians to polish speeches about the need to reopen the debate about sweeping banking reform and devise fresh ideas about getting banks to help stimulate the economy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC), one of the largest and most controversial companies on the London Stock Exchange, has been forced to slash its dividend and capital spending after seeing a 40% plunge to $1.1bn (\u00a3700m) in first half profits. The Kazakh-focused mining group at the centre of a recent storm over corporate governance, has been badly hit by a global economic slowdown that has sent commodity prices spinning downwards. The dividend was cut by 60% to 6.5\u00a2 per share while wider spending plans for 2012 have been cut by $300m to $2.4bn and a longer term investment target of $8.8bn is now under review. \"We have implemented a review of our capex (spending on) projects and are revising the development plan for our copper assets in the DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo) so as to improve the capital efficiency of our investment programme and returns to shareholders,\" said Felix Vulis, the ENRC chief executive. The company said it expected \"volatile market environment and pricing uncertainty\" to persist, putting further pressure on ENRC to come up quickly with a comprehensive restructuring promised earlier. ENRC shares fell 7% to 385p bringing cumulative losses of nearly 50% over the last 12 months as a result of a worsening business environment for mining but also because of internal disputes and poor corporate governance structures. Last year former GlaxoSmithKline chairman Sir Richard Sykes, and another non-executive director, Ken Olisa, were pushed off the board leading the latter to claim the company's approach to business was \"more Soviet than City\". In June ENRC brought in two new non-execs in British American Tobacco chairman, Richard Burrows, and World Bank executive, Mohsen Khalil. Last week it announced further changes in the chairmanships of internal committees in an attempt to \"refresh\" them. There was no further news on Wednesday on plans to either spin off or bring in new partners for the international business outside of Kazakhstan but more information could come at a City briefing planned for October. The $1.1bn first half profit figure was slightly ahead of City forecasts but underlying earnings per share of 36\u00a2 per share, compared with 91\u00a2 for the same period last year, were below the forecasts of mining analysts at Barclays Capital. In a research note on ENRC the investment bank said \"we retain our long-running concern over the company's balance sheet and think it is a near certainty the company raises capital over the next six months.\" Analysts at Credit Suisse said ENRC had over-extended itself by spending more than $5bn on acquisitions over the last three years \"at the wrong stage in the cycle, resulting in rapidly rising debt levels.\" The company has seen net borrowing levels rise by more than 100% since last year to $3.4bn.

    "webTitle": "Virgin Trains loses west coast mainline franchise to FirstGroup", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of Britain's most prestigious and lucrative rail franchises, the west coast mainline, was awarded to FirstGroup in a move that spells the end for Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Trains and led to transport analysts, the opposition and unions questioning whether the bid would lead to another fiasco. Branson, whose company has run the route since 1997, branded the decision \"insanity\", claiming that the government was taking a risk on \"almost certain bankruptcy\", while the RMT union said it would be \"an action replay of GNER and National Express\" \u2013 both of which were unable to see out their terms on the east coast line after making huge bids. Labour said the government needed to show it had not been \"blinded by the numbers\". However, FirstGroup, the UK's largest rail operator, said its winning bid of \u00a35.5bn for the rights to run the line from December until 2026, rising to \u00a36.1bn if it sees out a 20-month extension, was a \"deliverable proposition\" that would exploit unused capacity on the InterCity west coast services from London to destinations including Glasgow, Manchester and Liverpool. FirstGroup will also be offering a total of \u00a3265m in guarantees, including an unprecedentedly high \u00a3190m forfeit if it walks away early. The west coast mainline is the first of several long, lucrative franchises to be awarded over the next two years. The government has pledged to lower the taxpayer subsidy to the railway and has demanded large savings after the McNulty review identified potential costs to cut in the industry. FirstGroup was by far the highest bidder, and will have to find \u00a3390m in premiums each year compared with the \u00a3160m currently paid by Virgin, which tabled an enhanced offer of around \u00a34.8bn (\u00a35.4bn for the full term). Branson said Virgin would not be bidding for a franchise again \u2013 although he later told Channel 4 News he would reconsider if \"we get a call from David Cameron saying sorry\". FirstGroup said it would add around 12,000 seats, with 11 extra trains, and new direct services from the capital to stations including Blackpool, Shrewsbury and Bolton, although the DfT said this was not a franchise commitment. It will also reduce first-class seating, while reconfiguring the Pendolino trains to add more seats. Tim O'Toole, US-born chief executive of FirstGroup, rejected claims that there was excessive risk in his company's bid and said there was huge scope for growth on the line. He also categorically denied there would be job losses as unions fear, although he said many would be redeployed. \"Our winning bid is a deliverable proposition that is compelling for all who want to see a greater use of our rail networks,\" he added. Longer trains and additional seating will mean 35% more seats on the line in five years, O'Toole said: \"We will be making significant improvements including reduced journey times and introducing new direct services. We will improve marketing and deliver a smart ticketing system, refreshed and improved train interiors, station upgrades and even better catering.\" He would not confirm the name of the new service that will succeed Virgin although FirstGroup has registered the name Horizon at Companies House. O'Toole said he believed Virgin had failed to exploit the possibilities to attract customers on to the trains in quieter periods, and promised a 15% reduction in standard anytime fares over the next two years, a pledge that would see the price of a \u00a3148 single from London to Manchester drop by around \u00a322. Overall, fares are set to rise above inflation every year for the foreseeable future. The FirstGroup bid depends on passenger growth of 5.8% each year, a figure O'Toole said matched government predictions for trains to be at the limits of capacity by 2026, when the proposed high speed rail network should start operating. Responding to Branson's criticisms, he said: \"I think he lost the bid.\" Virgin Trains, which is 49% owned by the transport group Stagecoach, is believed to be considering challenging the decision in the courts. Unions and campaigners have warned the size of the bid means the operator will have to cut services. RMT union leader, Bob Crow, said: \"It is clear that this franchise is being let on pure McNulty terms with a gold-plated, extended contract linked to massive cuts to jobs and passenger services and huge increases in fares as the winning FirstGroup looks to extract every penny that they can in profit.\" City analysts queried the numbers. Mike van Dulken at Accendo Markets said [FirstGroup] had \"promised lots of investment, but growth and profitability assumptions could be too much.\" The transport academic Stephen Glaister, of the RAC Foundation, said: \"The big test here is that this award is going to a company that can deliver on what it promised.\" He said the biggest risk was that forecast growth in traffic would not materialise and the company could end up walking away from the franchise. FirstGroup declined to take up the last three years of its contract to run Great Western services, when it would have had to pay around \u00a3800m in premiums to the government. Maria Eagle said that awarding FirstGroup the west coast franchise meant that \"private train companies know that there are no penalties for gaming the rail system at the expense of taxpayers\". She added: \"They now know they can choose not to complete in full the maximum possible length of a franchise to avoid hundreds of millions of pounds in payments to the government and be rewarded with an even more lucrative contract.\" However, the rail minister, Theresa Villiers, said: \"This new franchise will deliver big improvements for passengers, with more seats and plans for more services.\" The DfT could not specify how targets would be enforced. Others queried how much the service element played in the award, given that FirstGroup's other train services have scored below Virgin in customer satisfaction ratings.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The number of Britons out of work has fallen to its lowest level in almost a year, with the decline partly due to jobs created by the London Olympics as well as an increase in self- and part-time employment. Unemployment on the internationally recognised International Labour Organisation measure fell by 46,000 in the three months to June to 2.56m, according to the Office for National Statistics, to 8%, the lowest rate since the three months to July 2011. The improvement in the labour market comes at a time when the economy has been stuck in recession for nine months. David Cameron's government has pinned its hopes on hiring by private companies making up for the 700,000 jobs lost as part of austerity cuts to public services. In London, the number of people out of work fell by 42,000, suggesting some of the improvement in the jobs market was due to the Olympic Games. The number of people claiming jobless benefits across Britain dropped by 5,900, defying City forecasts of an increase. The capital accounted for half the fall and for half the new jobs created between April and June \u2013 99,000 out of a total of 201,000 across the UK. This rise in employment, to 29.476m, was the biggest quarterly increase since the spring of 2010 and the highest level of employment since 2008. Part-time employment reached a record high of 8.07m but the number of people who are working part-time only because they cannot find a full-time job also hit a new high, of 1.42m. Liam Byrne, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \"We've got to redouble our efforts to get Britain back to work \u2013 90% of the fall in unemployment was in London, long-term youth unemployment is still going through the roof and part-time work has hit an all-time high as people struggle to find a full-time job.\" The headline figures contrast with the gloomy outlook for the economy painted by the Bank of England. It forecast no growth this year, while some City economists expect the economy to shrink. The fact that employment is growing while output is falling has been described as a \"genuine economic puzzle\" by the Bank of England. One explanation it advanced was that productivity had weakened, i.e. you need more employees to get the same out of them. Nomura economist Philip Rush said: \"The Bank is slowly recognising that more of productivity's weakness is permanent. Yet still there is widespread discussion of labour hoarding,\" he said, referring to employers keeping staff on in the hope of an upturn or to preserve skills. \"We do not understand why there is so much head scratching about this so-called 'conundrum'.\" Even so, many analysts expect unemployment to resume its rise in the coming months reflecting the poor state of the economy. ING economist James Knightley said: \"None of this is consistent with data showing the UK has contracted for three consecutive quarters and is [performing] at the same rates as Spain and Italy \u2013 where unemployment is moving sharply higher. Moreover, UK employment is up 656,000 since the beginning of 2010 and is up 407,000 since last summer, when the UK apparently went into recession again.\" Unemployment in Italy is well over 10% and is approaching 25% in Spain. Economists said low wage growth continued to support jobs growth, with inflation of 2.6% in July still outpacing pay rises. The ONS figures showed total pay rose by 1.6% in the three months to June from a year earlier. Regular pay, excluding bonuses, was up 1.8%. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the improvement in unemployment was hard to square with Britain's double-dip recession. \"It is evident that ongoing restrained earnings growth as well as significant increases in part-time jobs and self-employment is helping to keep unemployment down. \" The holding of the Olympic Games appeared to provide at least a temporary boost to employment in the latest figures given the stronger performance of the London labour market.\"",

      "bodyText": "Standard Chartered shares jumped after the London-based bank fended off threats by a New York regulator to revoke its banking licence for alleged breaches of US sanctions that it is claimed left the financial system vulnerable to corrupt regimes and weapons and drug dealers. The shares rose 3% when the market opened in London, even though the bank agreed to pay a $340m (\u00a3220m) penalty \u2013 a sum expected to rise once the bank settles with other US authorities investigating the breaches, which allegedly took place between 2001 and 2007. Analysts had expected the shares \u2013 which have slumped from \u00a316 since the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) levelled the damning charges last Monday \u2013 to rise because, despite the embarrassment of the fine, the bank's crucial banking licence was preserved. But the chief executive, Peter Sands, remains under intense pressure because the increase to \u00a314.10 still leaves the bank's shares much further to go to regain their losses. Analysts at UBS said: \"The aggregate of this fine, plus any additional recompense to other regulators, could total less than 1% of Standard Chartered's equity and the DFS fine represents around 6% of our current earnings forecast for Standard Chartered, suggesting the company will be able to absorb this cost and still deliver a 10th successive year of record profits.\" The settlement was made by Sands even though last week he had come out fighting, insisting the DFS order contained inaccuracies.
