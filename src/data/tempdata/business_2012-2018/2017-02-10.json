      "bodyText": "Reckitt Benckiser, the company behind Nurofen, Dettol and Durex, is moving into baby food with the $16.6bn (\u00a313.3bn) acquisition of a US infant formula maker, its biggest deal to date. Mead Johnson Nutrition manufactures Enfa formula, which it says is the main infant nutrition brand in the world and will become the combined group\u2019s biggest \u201cpowerbrand\u201d, with sales of $3.7bn a year. The company also produces Choco Milk, Lactum and other milk-based products for children. Reckitt\u2019s top brands at present are Durex condoms, Mucinex cough remedy and Dettol and Lysol cleaners. Adding baby food to its vast portfolio of household products will raise the company\u2019s standing among consumer multinationals Unilever, Nestl\u00e9, Danone and Procter &amp; Gamble. Mead is the third-largest baby food company in the world, after Nestl\u00e9 and Danone, according to market research company Euromonitor International. The global baby food market is forecast to grow by between 7.4% and 8.5% annually in the coming years. Reckitt\u2019s chief executive, Rakesh Kapoor, hailed the acquisition as a \u201csignificant step\u201d forward for the company. \u201cThis deal will in one move almost double our consumer health business. This is about trusted relationships with the medical community. Maybe this company [Mead] is not very well known in the UK investor base, but it fits our definition of consumer health,\u201d he said. Kapoor said the acquisition would strengthen Reckitt\u2019s presence in developing markets, particularly China. These will make up 40% of the combined group\u2019s sales, with China the second-largest market after the US. Five years ago, China was not in Reckitt\u2019s top 10 markets, he said. The deal is estimated to bring \u00a3200m in annual cost savings. The two companies have not discussed job losses yet, Kapoor said, but employees in the UK will not be affected, as Mead only has a small business in the country. It generates half of its sales in Asia, one-third in North America and Europe (mostly in the US), and 17% in Latin America. Mead employs 7,600 people globally, while Reckitt has a workforce of 37,000. The regular Enfa infant formula is not on sale in the UK, but some specialist Enfa products are. Kapoor said it was too early to say whether Enfa would be sold more widely in the UK after the takeover. But Reckitt noted that it had made a success of taking on localised brands and rolling them out across the world. Lianne van den Bos, a senior analyst at Euromonitor, said: \u201cReckitt Benckiser\u2019s takeover bid of Mead Johnson is one that surprised us all as it signifies little overlap with their current business, but it hints at future growth strategies for the consumer packaged goods industry. \u201cHealth nutrition is the way forward and marks many companies\u2019 changing direction for growth, the latest examples being Danone and Nestl\u00e9. \u201cReckitt Benckiser\u2019s plunge in[to] a market [China] set to drive half of future global baby food growth could well pay off in the long run.\u201d Reckitt is paying $90 per share in cash. Including Mead\u2019s debt, the value of the deal is $17.9bn. The takeover needs to be approved by shareholders and regulators. The company, founded in 1905 by Edward Mead Johnson, later passed into the ownership of US drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb and floated on the stock market when it was spun off eight years ago. The acquisition comes after a tough year for Reckitt that saw slowing sales, a toxic disinfectant scandal in South Korea and a fine in Australia, as well as shareholder anger over Kapoor\u2019s \u00a323m pay package. Several South Korean retailers dropped Reckitt\u2019s products after a humidifier steriliser made by the company caused deadly lung problems. Kapoor issued a personal apology at the company\u2019s annual meeting in May. In Australia, Reckitt was fined AUS$1.7m (\u00a31m) for making misleading claims about its Nurofen painkillers. Mead faces a lawsuit from a whistleblower (paywall), a former employee alleging that she was unfairly dismissed after raising safety issues over bottles of infant formula.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s promise of a \u201cphenomenal\u201d tax plan to be unveiled soon has sent most markets higher for the second day, outweighing any worries from Fitch\u2019s assessment of the US president as a risk to the global economy. There has been some divergence, with the US markets hitting new peaks and the UK outperforming European markets, amid worries about Greece and the forthcoming elections in France, the Netherlands and Germany. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 0.4% or 29.25 points at 7258.75, boosted by mining shares as metal prices rallied after positive Chinese trade data Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.21% to 11,666.97 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.04% at 4828.32 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.45% to 18,862.11 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.64% at 9378.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.46% to 623.79 as creditor meetings continued On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 89 points or 0.45%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. More on Greece from Helena Smith: There is no reason why the IMF should be part of the Greek rescue deal, according to ECB member and president of the National Bank of Austria, Ewald Nowotny. Germany has said the IMF must be part of the Greek solution, but in an interview with Der Standard (in German), Nowotny said: I do not understand why at the EU level one insists that the fund is on board. This would only be an additional complication, which does not contribute to the solution of the problem. There is neither economic nor political justification. Greece is a European problem, and Europe will solve it. I fear, politicians deliberately create a crisis scenario, the solution of which is uncertain. Because we do not know the role of the IMF under the influence of Trump\u2019s United States. So, if the next financial crisis comes, where could it start? Perhaps with car loans. Patrick Collinson reports: A huge increase in the amounts borrowed by already indebted households in Britain and the US to buy new vehicles is fuelling fears that \u201csub-prime cars\u201d could ignite the next financial crash. British households borrowed a record \u00a331.6bn in 2016 to buy cars, up 12% on the year before, said the Finance and Leasing Association on Friday. Nine out of 10 private car buyers are now using personal contract plans (known as PCPs), which have boomed since interest rates fell to historic lows. Under these cheap leasing deals, buyers pay a small deposit and then commit to making a monthly payment for the next three years with the option to buy or hand back the car at the end. The rise of PCPs helps to explain rocketing car sales in Britain despite flat or falling household incomes. A record 2.7m new cars were sold in Britain last year \u2013 the fifth year in a row of rising sales. Per head, the British are buying more new cars than any other large country in Europe. Car financing in the UK is a \u201cflashing light\u201d, according to Andrew Evans, a fund manager at investment firm Schroders. \u201cBorrowing is a very bad idea when it is done against a depreciating asset \u2026 such as a car,\u201d he said, adding that there was a \u201cserious level of fragility built into the system\u201d. The full story is here: Markets continue to move higher, more so in the US and UK than in Europe, where investors worry about Greece\u2019s debt problems and the uncertainty over the forthcoming elections in France, the Netherlands and Germany. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all hitting new peaks on the back of Trump\u2019s promised tax reforms, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The final session of the week confirms that the bulls are in charge once again. Yet more record highs for the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 all point to a re-energised rally for stock markets, and while there has been a modest intraday wobble, this has simply provided a fresh chance for some new buyers to hop on board. Investors looked like they had fallen out of love with mining stocks earlier this week, but it appears this too was just a brief period of disillusionment and now the romance is back on... Earnings season is beginning to wind down in the US, but overall the period has not seen any major surprises, and the promise of a Trump tax plan seems perfectly calculated to keep markets on the front foot. Just in case you thought the latest Greek drama might threaten to come to an early resolution: On the NIESR data, Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said: The NIESR\u2019s latest estimate suggests UK economic output accelerated impressively during the three months ending in January, in what is the latest sign of a resilient UK economy. The post-Brexit Armageddon predicted by so many is still absent, with consistent growth since June\u2019s votes leaving economists eating humble pie for now. However, a period of uncertainty is imminent. Prime Minister Theresa May has the mandate to trigger Article 50 in the coming weeks and forecasts predict GDP will enter a downwards spiral in 2017. The Brexit-hit pound is expected to drive inflation and could squeeze consumer spending. Back with the UK, and more signs of improvement in the country\u2019s economy after better than expected trade, construction and manufacturing figures earlier. In the three months to the end of January, the economy grew by 0.7%, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. This compares to a figure of 0.6% in the three months to the end of December. Oriol Carreras, research fellow at NIESR, said: Growth was driven by robust consumer spending combined with a pickup in output in production industries. This represents the first expansion of production, on a three month on three month rolling basis, since September 2016. Despite our estimates indicating a strong start of 2017, we expect economic growth to soften to 1.7 per cent this year as rising consumer price inflation weighs on consumer spending. At the start of this month, NIESR forecast that GDP grew by 2% in 2016 and 1.7% in 2017. It seems US consumers are not as confident as had been expected, with Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies (not surprsingly) dominating sentiment. The preliminary University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for February came in at 95.7, compared to forecasts of 97.9 and January\u2019s final figure of 98.5. The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said this could be an early sign for concern about future consumer spending patterns: Consumer confidence retreated from the decade-peak recorded in January, with the decline centered in the Expectations Index. To be sure, confidence remains quite favorable, with only five higher readings in the past decade. Importantly, the data do not reflect any closing of the partisan divide. The Michigan survey includes several free-response questions which ask respondents to answer in their own words, without any prompting or proposed answer categories. When asked to describe any recent news that they had heard about the economy, 30% spontaneously mentioned some favorable aspect of Trump\u2019s policies, and 29% unfavorably referred to Trump\u2019s economic policies. Thus a total of nearly six-in-ten consumers made a positive or negative mention of government policies. In the long history of the surveys, this total had never reached even half that amount, except for five surveys in 2013 and 2014 that were solely dominated by negative references to the debt and fiscal cliff crises. Moreover, never before have these spontaneous references to economic policies had such a large impact on the Sentiment Index: a difference of 37 Index points between those that referred to favorable and unfavorable policies. These differences are troublesome: the Democrat\u2019s Expectations Index is close to its historic low (indicating recession) and the Republican\u2019s Expectations Index is near its historic high (indicating expansion). While currently distorted by partisanship, the best bet is that the gap will narrow to match a more moderate pace of growth. Nonetheless, it has been long known that negative rather than positive expectations are more influential in determining spending, so forecasts of consumer expenditures must take into account a higher likelihood of asymmetric downside risks. Investors appear to be shrugging off the warnings from Fitch that Donald Trump poses a risk to the global economy. Instead they are still concentrating on the prospect of further stimulus measures after the president promised \u201cphenomenal\u201d news on tax reforms in the next few weeks. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new record of 20,232 in early trading, before slipping back to 20,230, still up 58 points or 0.29%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also opened at new highs. More from Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner responsible for financial stability, financial services and capital markets union, currently on a visit to London. He hinted in a Q&amp;A session after his speech at Bloomberg\u2019s London HQ that the EU could go it alone on Greece should the IMF quit the scene. Our economics correspondent Phillip Inman was there. He says: Dombrovskis said all parties were close to pressing the button on the next phase of bail out cash for Athens even though the IMF\u2019s forecasts for Greek growth and therefore public sector spending surplus were much lower than the EU\u2019s. Nevertheless, he said that the European Stability Mechanism, which has lent \u20ac174bn to Greece, has a rulebook and this stresses that it is only preferable and not necessary for parties other than the ESM and European Central Bank to be involved in any rescue. Many executives at the IMF believe Greece cannot hope to repay its debts while the economy remains flat on its back. It is considering whether to pull out of a joint rescue with the EU. By focussing on the rulebook in his answer, Dombrovskis is giving a clear hint that Brussels is prepared to impose a deal on Athens with the ECB and wave goodbye to the IMF. Fitch says the countries most at risk of a sovereign downgrade are those \u201cwith close economic and financial ties with the US that come under scrutiny due to either existing financial imbalances or perceptions of unfair frameworks or practices that govern their bilateral relations\u201d. So that\u2019s Canada, China, Germany, Japan and Mexico for starters, \u201cbut the list is unlikely to end there,\u201d Fitch warns. Fitch has just issued a warning that President Trump poses a risk to the global economy, raising the prospect that countries will suffer a rating downgrade. The ratings agency highlighted Trump\u2019s unpredictability, trade relations, limits on migration, and rows between policymakers as areas of concern: The Trump Administration represents a risk to international economic conditions and global sovereign credit fundamentals. US policy predictability has diminished, with established international communication channels and relationship norms being set aside and raising the prospect of sudden, unanticipated changes in US policies with potential global implications. The primary risks to sovereign credits include the possibility of disruptive changes to trade relations, diminished international capital flows, limits on migration that affect remittances and confrontational exchanges between policymakers that contribute to heightened or prolonged currency and other financial market volatility. The materialisation of these risks would provide an unfavourable backdrop for economic growth, putting pressure on public finances that may have rating implications for some sovereigns. Increases in the cost or reductions in the availability of external financing, particularly if accompanied by currency depreciation, could also affect ratings. Fitch does say that elements of Trump\u2019s economic agenda would be positive for growth, including his pledge to spend more on US infrastructure. Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s former finance minister, has been talking to Helena Smith, our correspondent in Athens. She reports: \u201cGreece is being pressurised yet again to extend and deepen its crisis and become even more unreformable just because the creditors cannot agree with one another on how to deal with the mess they created in 2010,\u201d Varoufakis said, referring to the \u20ac110bn Athens received in the form of a first bailout. \u201cIndia under the British Empire had more power than Greece has today under the third memorandum of understanding (bailout). Varoufakis said the rescue remedies Greece was being forced to follow was tantamount to giving \u201ccortisone to a cancer patient.\u201d The crisis, if snuffed out this time, would be reignited as soon as debt repayments matured again. \u201cFollow the money,\u201d he quipped. \u201cGreece\u2019s position in the eurozone is impossible without debt restructuring. \u201c \u201cGrexit is a football being kicked around between [the German finance minister] Dr Schauble and [the German Chacellor] Mrs Merkel. Schauble is determined to kick Greece out and Merkel is determined not to make a decision until she really must,\u201d Varoufakis said. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner responsible for financial stability, financial services and capital markets union, is on a visit to London, and has taken a more sophisticated route to issuing the UK with threats of economic disaster. Phillip Inman reports: In line with other senior Brussels officials, who appear to be less bombastic about the threat to Britain\u2019s economy from Brexit, Dombrovskis said that the EU will always be welcoming to British businesses and sees no threat to London\u2019s standing as an international financial centre. But he warned that a failure to stay aligned with EU rules will make it increasingly difficult for Brussels to negotiate a deal with low tariff trade barriers and for low tariff trade to remain in place. Speaking at Bloomberg\u2019s London offices about \u201cAccelerating the Capital Markets Union\u201d, he said: Far from being held back by international rules and standards agreed in the last decade \u2013 London has been thriving. And regardless of the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU, London will only continue to thrive on the basis of a strong international system. The sting in the tail came with the comment: We very much hope to continue working with all our partners internationally, but this is not only in our hands. What is in the hands of the EU, is to preserve recent reforms and firmly uphold our prudential framework. [\u2026] He said equivalence was an important concept and the more the UK failed to meet requiremrents for equivalence, the less access it will have: Based on strong common international cooperation, the EU has been very open to recognise that our international partners\u2019 rules are equivalent and achieve the same objective as ours. But these findings depend very much on the specific conditions of individual sectors and country at the time when the decisions are made. If these conditions change, we will have to reassess the situation. The clear warning is that if the UK adopts practices and rules that are not part of the EU system now or at any point in the future by signing trade deals with the US and other countries, then the EU will become closed to UK business. He said the EU will fight to develop and maintain common rules for global financial stability. But speeding up the creation of the Capital Markets Union is a priority and if London refuses to tag along, the EU will rely increasingly on its own capital markets. He said: We are also moving ahead with work to build a single market for capital, a Capital Markets Union. [\u2026] We want to quicken the pace on existing work, such as measures to make business restructuring easier and plans to build a pan European private pensions market. Also to be more ambitious in the areas such as Fintech and sustainable finance. [\u2026] The prospect of Europe\u2019s largest financial centre leaving the single market makes our task more challenging, but all the more important. Greece\u2019s borrowing costs have fallen sharply as optimism rises that progress will be made on debt talks with its EU creditors. Two-year Greek government bond yields fell more than 110 basis points to 8.8%, moving away from seven-month highs above 10% earlier this weeks. Lyn Graham-Taylor, senior rates strategy for Dutch bank Rabobank: There seems to be a high degree of will to put this issue to bed prior to elections in the eurozone. Greece\u2019s Europe minister, George Katrougalos, has expressed confidence that a deal will be struck between Athens and its creditors to unlock a further wave of funding. He told journalists on Thursday: I am optimistic that we can have such an agreement before the Eurogroup of 20 February. If we had just to deal with the Europeans we would have already completed this review in December. All the delay is due to the ambivalence of the IMF to participate or not to participate . He dismissed comments by the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who said Greece must implement reforms or leave the eurozone. Katrougalos commented: Mr Sch\u00e4uble is now an isolated voice in Europe, one of the last defenders of austerity. The market is Athens is up 3% as investors appear to be hopeful of a breakthrough between the Greek government and its European creditors. Reuters is reporting that Greece\u2019s eurozone lenders and the International Monetary Fund have reached an agreement on a common stance they will present to Greece, following a rift earlier in the week. The news agency quotes an unnamed senior eurozone official: \u201cThere is agreement to present a united front to the Greeks,\u201d the euro zone official said, adding that the outcome of Friday\u2019s meeting with the Greeks was still unclear and it was unclear if Athens would accept the proposals. \u201cWhat comes out of it, we will see,\u201d the official said. A united stance among euro zone governments and the IMF is a breakthrough because they have differed for months on the size of the primary surplus Greece should reach in 2018 and maintain for years later as well as the issue of debt relief. Those differences have hindered efforts to unlock further funding for Greece under its latest euro zone bailout program. Turning to Greece, finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has urgently flown to Brussels in an attempt to end the deadlock in stalled talks between the country and its EU-led creditors. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens: In a last ditch effort to break the deadlock that has once again ignited fears of a new Greek crisis \u2013 and default by the summer \u2013 finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has rushed to Brussels for a meeting with the heads of the creditor institutions. Speculation is rife that the Oxford-educated Tsakalotos is prepared to make what the Greek media this morning are describing as the \u201cbig compromise\u201d in order to clinch a \u201ctechnical\u201d agreement with lenders before euro area finance minister hold their monthly Eurogroup session on 20 February. If sealed, auditors would return to Athens next week in the hopes of finally concluding the compliance review at the heart of the impasse. Tsakalotos is expected to be presented with an alternative set of measures that Athens\u2019 leftist-led government could put its signature to in time for a deal to be reached before Europe goes into election mode, starting with polls in the Netherlands next month. The proposal, to be presented to the minister this afternoon, is believed to be more palatable in that the government would not have to legislate contingency measures (not least tax increases and pension cuts) before the country\u2019s current bailout expires in the summer of 2018. The cuts are thought to amount to 2 percent of Greek gross domestic product and would only be implemented if Athens fails to meet the budget targets agreed under its latest bailout. If true, the face-saving formula may avert the spectre of bankruptcy this summer when Greek faces a \u20ac7bn debt repayment in July, but is unlikely to resolve the lingering problem of Greece\u2019s mountainous debt or go down well with many in the ruling Syriza party who have become increasingly restive at the prospect of inflicting yet more measures on austerity-whipped Greeks. So far Friday has been a day of forecast-beating data from China and the UK. But investor sentiment is underpinned by comments from President Trump, whose every word is closely scrutinised. He dangled a big carrot on Thursday, promising to reveal \u201cphenomenal\u201d tax plans within a matter of two or three weeks. Sean Spicer, White House spokesman, elaborated on Trump\u2019s comments, suggesting the biggest overhaul in US personal and business taxes since President Reagan\u2019s Tax Reform Act of 1986. [It\u2019s going to be] a comprehensive plan, something we haven\u2019t seen since 1986 ... It\u2019s going to recognize the need to give so many working Americans the relief that they need. What he wants to do is create a tax climate that not only keeps jobs here but incentivizes companies to want to come here, to grow here, to create jobs here, to bring their profits back here. \u201cIt\u2019s a boom!\u201d So says Scotiabank economist Alan Clarke about the flurry of decent UK data today on trade, manufacturing and construction in December. He says GDP data for the fourth quarter could be revised to show the economy grew by 0.7% between October and December, and not 0.6% as first estimated by the ONS last month. Clarke explains: Yes these are backwards looking since they relate to December. BUT the preliminary Q4 GDP data had made assumptions for how these would perform and those assumptions were far too pessimistic. The punchline is that other things equal, this points to Q4 GDP being revised UP to 0.7% quarter-on-quarter. We all thought the Bank of England were mad when they came out with a 2% growth forecast for this year. They may come out of this looking very smart. The pound has been given a slight boost by the forecast-beating UK data. It is currently hovering just above the $1.25 mark. Sterling is also up 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1742. Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, says the ONS data suggests growth is becoming more balanced. Today\u2019s UK economic activity data added to other evidence suggesting that the economy maintained a significant amount of momentum at the end of 2016 and implies that growth is becoming more balanced. The December output figures do provide a base for more balanced growth in 2017. Indeed, we think that the expansion in manufacturing activity will exceed that in services for the first time since 2011, as the manufacturing sector gets a competitive boost from the fall in the pound, but consumer services growth is constrained by rising inflation. Growth in the UK has been heavily on Britain\u2019s consumers since the financial crisis. Services is the only main sector of the UK economy where output has surpassed pre-crisis levels. Manufacturing and construction has lagged. Here\u2019s how Asia closed: Kate Davies, senior statistician at the ONS, is commenting on the UK data. She says there is no evidence that a weaker pound is having an impact on trade: The UK trade deficit narrowed to \u00a38.6 billion in the final quarter of 2016 as exports of products including oil and aircraft to non-EU countries increased. There was also a notable increase in export sales of gold to overseas buyers. While both exports and imports grew over 2016, there remains little evidence that the weaker pound has had an effect on the trade balance. Industrial output and the construction sector both remained broadly flat over the final quarter of 2016 but grew in December, with manufacturing growth driven by a strong month for often volatile pharmaceuticals and the expansion in construction led by house and commercial building. The UK economy was in better-than-expected shape in December according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. A quick summary: The trade in goods deficit narrowed to \u00a310.9bn from \u00a311.6bn in November (itself revised down from \u00a312.2bn) Industrial output rose 1.1% following 2% growth in November Manufacturing output jumped 2.1% from 1.4% in November Construction output was up 1.8%, following 0.4% growth previously No sign of a Brexit slowdown here.. Just Eat fell 6%, making it the biggest FTSE 250 faller, after chief executive David Buttress said he was stepping down. The online takeaway ordering service said Buttress was leaving the top job because of \u201curgent family matters\u201d. He will work full time until the end of the first quarter when the chairman John Hughes will take over until a replacement is found. Buttress will stay on at the company as a non-executive director for a least a year. He said: It has been a great privilege to work alongside, and then lead, the exceptional team at Just Eat, helping to build the business from the very first restaurant in the UK to the company it is today. I would like to thank the board for their understanding, and I am very pleased that I will be able to continue to play a role in the future of the business as a non-executive director. This has been one of the best jobs in the world, and I wish my successor all the best when they take on the role. Hughes said Buttress had been \u201can incredible leader and colleague\u201d, who was leaving the business in \u201cexcellent health\u201d. Coming up in less than half an hour we have a flurry of data from the UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics. The trade in goods deficit is expected to narrow slightly to \u00a311.5bn in December from \u00a312.2bn. Growth in industrial output is expected to slow to 0.2% in December from 2.1% rise in November. Manufacturing output growth is forecast to slow to 0.5%, following a 1.3 increase previously. Construction output is expected to rise 1% in December, following a 0.2% drop in November. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says the data will be a \u201ctest\u201d for the FTSE. The miners are the FTSE 100\u2019s top risers this morning, helped by the strong Chinese trade data which suggested global demand was in decent shape at the start of the year. The FTSE 100 is up 4o points or 0.6% in early trading, at 7,270. Markets elsewhere in Europe are also higher, with the exception of Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB. There are fresh fears surrounding Italy\u2019s Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, after losses widened in the fourth quarter. The scores so far: Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 11,698 France\u2019s CAC: +0.3% at 4,842 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 18,892 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.2% at 9,455 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 368 Strong trade data from China is also giving investors that Friday feeling. Exports rose 7.9% in January, easily beating analysts\u2019 expectations and following a 6.1% drop in January. Imports rose by 16.7%, also beating forecasts. It pushed China\u2019s trade surplus to $51.35bn for the month, the General Administration of Customs said, from $40.71bn in December. China\u2019s swelling trade surplus is unlikely to go unnoticed at the White House, where Trump has threatened to take a new protectionist stance to trade. China\u2019s trade surplus with the US was $21.37bn in January, slightly lower than the $21.73bn in December. Economists cautioned that trends in January and February can be distorted by the long Chinese new year celebrations. Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, says: These figures need to be taken with a pinch of salt as annual shifts in the timing of Chinese New Year make year-on-year trade growth highly volatile at the start of each year. It\u2019s likely that much of the pick-up last month was seasonal. Admittedly, the holiday took place earlier this year than last, meaning that more of the disruptions to trade will have fallen in January. But it appears that this was more than offset by the fact that, unlike last year, all of the pre-holiday rush to import goods and meet exports orders fell in January too. Stepping back, the big picture is that Chinese trade values have been picking up in recent months thanks to a revival in global manufacturing, the continued strength of China\u2019s domestic economy and the rebound in global commodity prices. We expect this improvement to be sustained in the short-run, even as Chinese New Year distortions mean that headline trade growth is likely to fall back sharply in February. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Asian markets have made strong gains following new record highs on Wall Street and a stronger dollar. The reason for this renewed investor optimism is the promise of more stimulus in the US. Specifically, President Trump said he would be announcing \u201csomething phenomenal in terms of tax\u201d over \u201cthe next two or three weeks.\u201d Vague, but enough to boost investors hooked on stimulus, as CMC Markets\u2019 Michael Hewson explains: The move to new record highs in equity markets and surge in the US dollar are symptomatic of a market craving a new stimulus. The risk is that as with most oases they turn out to be an illusion, and given the new President\u2019s propensity for melodrama the risk is that this could well be no different. It is hard to imagine that he will be able to promise anything tangible within a two to three week window, however whatever the realities investors appear happy to take him at his word, as US markets closed well above their previous peaks, while the US dollar index looks set to post its first positive week this year. Investors might also be comforted by the more conciliatory note struck by the President with China, following his first conversation with President Xi Jinping since taking office. In Asia, the Nikkei was up 2.5%, the Hang Seng up 0.4% and the Topix up 2.2% and the Shanghai Composite up 0.4%. European markets are also expected to open higher: We will also bring you all the latest developments from Greece, where the government is hoping to stave off a fresh debt crisis.",

Nine out of 10 private car buyers are now using personal contract plans (known as PCPs), which have boomed since interest rates fell to historic lows. </p> <p>Under these cheap leasing deals, buyers pay a small deposit and then commit to making a monthly payment for the next three years with the option to buy or hand back the car at the end. The rise of PCPs helps to explain rocketing car sales in Britain despite flat or falling household incomes.

Earnings season is beginning to wind down in the US, but overall the period has not seen any major surprises, and the promise of a Trump tax plan seems perfectly calculated to keep markets on the front foot.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-589dd95ee4b09b65848ea3b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-10T15:18:32.465Z\">3.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Just in case you thought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/feb/10/markets-boosted-by-trumps-phenomenal-tax-pledge-business-live?page=with:block-589d9b96e4b01b5caf3cea75#block-589d9b96e4b01b5caf3cea75\">the latest Greek drama</a> might threaten to come to an early resolution:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Elbarbie/status/830071746409660416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Meeting btw institutions + <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tsakalotos\">@tsakalotos</a> has started &quot;no deal is expected today&quot; say both Greek and EU officials.</p>&mdash; Eleni Varvitsiotis (@Elbarbie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Elbarbie/status/830071746409660416\">February 10, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/830071583058313216\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Greek official: No bailout deal expected in meeting today<br>- Brussels meeting shouldn&#39;t be dramatised</p>&mdash; Livesquawk (@Livesquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/830071583058313216\">February 10, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-10T15:39:40.814Z\">at 3.39pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-589dd787e4b0fcbf4e7d4785\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-10T15:16:35.596Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the NIESR data, Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at Xtrade, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The NIESR\u2019s latest estimate suggests UK economic output accelerated impressively during the three months ending in January, in what is the latest sign of a resilient UK economy.</p> <p>The post-Brexit Armageddon predicted by so many is still absent, with consistent growth since June\u2019s votes leaving economists eating humble pie for now.</p> <p>However, a period of uncertainty is imminent.

The survey\u2019s chief economist Richard Curtin said this could be an early sign for concern about future consumer spending patterns:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Consumer confidence retreated from the decade-peak recorded in January, with the decline centered in the Expectations Index. To be sure, confidence remains quite favorable, with only five higher readings in the past decade.</p> <p>Importantly, the data do not reflect any closing of the partisan divide. The Michigan survey includes several free-response questions which ask respondents to answer in their own words, without any prompting or proposed answer categories. When asked to describe any recent news that they had heard about the economy, 30% spontaneously mentioned some favorable aspect of Trump\u2019s policies, and 29% unfavorably referred to Trump\u2019s economic policies.</p> <p>Thus a total of nearly six-in-ten consumers made a positive or negative mention of government policies.

While currently distorted by partisanship, the best bet is that the gap will narrow to match a more moderate pace of growth. Nonetheless, it has been long known that negative rather than positive expectations are more influential in determining spending, so forecasts of consumer expenditures must take into account a higher likelihood of asymmetric downside risks. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-589dcecde4b012eeb30c8882\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-10T14:43:46.649Z\">2.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Dow hits new peak as Wall Street opens</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Investors appear to be shrugging off the warnings from Fitch that Donald Trump poses a risk to the global economy.

      "bodyText": "The billionaire Candy brothers moved their business offshore because they were \u201cnot prepared to pay any tax\u201d on the profits from their luxury property developments, a former associate has claimed. Entrepreneur Mark Holyoake, a university friend of Nick Candy who fell out with the brothers over a business deal, made the allegation as he took the witness stand in the high court in London on Friday. He is bringing a \u00a3132m damages action against pair. The case has shone a spotlight on the finances of two of Britain\u2019s best known property tycoons, with allegations that they evaded tax on lucrative projects including the One Hyde Park development in Knightsbridge, central London, where penthouses were snapped up by oligarchs and Gulf royalty for as much as \u00a3140m apiece. The brothers deny the charges, saying the claims are \u201cslanderous and entirely false\u201d. Holyoake, who has known Nick Candy since they shared a house at university, told the court their friendship had been \u201cexceptionally close\u201d. Having gone their separate ways after graduating, the pair reconnected in the early 2000s and began to see each other weekly. Nick Candy enjoyed playing with Holyoake\u2019s children and was affectionately dubbed \u201cclown Candy\u201d by the family. The two would often discuss business and share confidences, said Holyoake. \u201cNick often said that he and his brother were not prepared to pay any tax on the profits from their successful developments,\u201d Holyoake claimed in a witness statement released on Friday. \u201cIt is for this reason that he said their business had to be moved offshore.\u201d The Candys split their business a decade ago, with the most lucrative element \u2013 developing and selling property \u2013 relocating from the UK to the tax haven of Guernsey. It is run by Christian Candy through his CPC Group. Nick Candy stayed in the UK to manage the interior decoration arm. With no UK-based owner, the profits from One Hyde Park, with its iris-scanning security system, virtual golf range and hidden servants\u2019 quarters, were shipped out of reach of the British taxman. But Holyoake maintains that Nick Candy remained a \u201cshadow director\u201d and undeclared partner in CPC. He alleges that in the last three years, Nick Candy has received a series of payments in kind from Christian Candy, which amount to dividends from the property business, in the form of cash, a yacht, a penthouse and a Chelsea mansion. The Candy brothers reject these claims, saying the assets were gifts. \u201cMy wife, Emma, and I would often tease Nick about all of the assets in their joint business being held by Chris,\u201d said Holyoake. The brothers owned a yacht called Candyscape, and Holyoake would ask Nick whether its master bedroom belonged to Chris. \u201cNick would sometimes react to this teasing and repeatedly told anyone who would listen that all of the assets held by CPC belonged to him and his brother jointly,\u201d said Holyoake. \u201cHe would say that he and Chris were 50-50 owners or they were \u2018straight down the middle\u2019 in the ownership of CPC.\u201d The Candys have always maintained that Nick Candy has no stake in CPC. If the company had been jointly owned by a UK resident, the profits from One Hyde Park and other developments could be liable for UK tax, Holyoake claims. He said he had warned his friend that HM Revenue and Customs might not approve of the arrangement, but that \u201cNick literally felt they were above the law\u201d. The case continues.",

    "webTitle": "Former Rolls-Royce boss questioned in corruption inquiry", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir John Rose, the former chief executive of Rolls-Royce, has been questioned under caution as part of the Serious Fraud Office\u2019s investigation into a corruption scandal at the engineering group. Rose is one of a \u201clarge number\u201d of former Rolls-Royce executives to have been interviewed under caution, according to sources familiar with the inquiry. This involves legal rights being read out to the individual being questioned and is not the same as being questioned as a witness. The interviews are often voluntary, with the individual invited to attend by investigators. Rose also left his position as a director of two organisations in recent weeks. He resigned as director of the Eden Trust, owner of the Eden Project in Cornwall, on 27 January, just 10 days after Rolls-Royce and the SFO announced the company had agreed to pay \u00a3671m to settle allegations it bribed middlemen around the world between 1989 and 2013. Rose was appointed as an Eden Trust director in August 2006. The Eden Project said: \u201cThe Eden Project can confirm that Sir John Rose has completed his term with the Eden Trust and retired as a trustee after more than 10 years on the board. We are very grateful to Sir John for his many years of support and guidance.\u201d Rose also resigned as a director of Ombu, which invests in industrial technology companies, on 30 November, according to records at Companies House. Mark King, the former head of civil aerospace at Rolls-Royce, also stepped down as chairman of Open Energi, one of the companies Ombu has invested in, on 23 January. A company spokesman said King would remain on the board as a non-executive and that the change was part of a management reshuffle. The \u00a3671m payment by Rolls-Royce, of which nearly \u00a3500m will be paid to UK authorities, is the biggest ever penalty for criminal conduct for a British company. In his judgment in the high court on the deferred prosecution agreement, the settlement between the SFO and Rolls-Royce, Sir Brian Leveson said the company had conducted \u201cthe most serious breaches of the criminal law in the areas of bribery and corruption\u201d and that some of the allegations \u201cimplicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company\u201d. Leveson said the charges against Rolls-Royce were \u201cdevastating and of the very greatest gravity\u201d. He also said in his judgment that the company had been aware of corruption allegations in 2010 but decided not to notify the authorities. However, the judge praised the cooperation of the company\u2019s existing management with the investigation and said all the key players involved in the scandal had left. David Green, the SFO director, has said it intends to announce within the next few months whether it will bring charges against individuals. The questioning of Rose, who ran the aircraft engine maker from 1996 to 2011, was first reported by the Financial Times. The SFO declined to comment on Rose or confirm how many Rolls-Royce executives had been interviewed. Rose denies any wrongdoing and has not been charged. He declined to comment, as did the law firm representing him, WilmerHale. Stephen Pollard, the lawyer representing Rose, previously defended the Barings Bank rogue trader Nick Leeson and property tycoon Vincent Tchenguiz in his successful fight against the SFO. While boss of Rolls-Royce, Rose was regarded as a captain of industry and a leading figure in British business. When Rose announced his retirement from Rolls-Royce in 2010, Sir Vince Cable, then the business secretary, described him as a \u201cchampion of UK advanced manufacturing\u201d and praised the \u201chuge contribution he\u2019s made to strategic thinking both within business and government on growing global market share\u201d. Rolls-Royce will be in the spotlight again next week when the FTSE 100 company publishes its full-year results. Warren East, the current chief executive, has already apologised for the scandal and said the behaviour uncovered by the SFO and other authorities was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. East is likely to face further questions about the scandal, including what changes have been made at Rolls-Royce and whether the company could lose contracts as a result of its damaged reputation.",

      "bodyText": "Pimlico Plumbers has lost a court battle over the status of its workers, in the latest legal ruling on employment status in the gig economy. It came as the government released a report warning that \u201cunscrupulous\u201d employers were in a position to exploit low-paid and low-skilled workers. Plumber Gary Smith, who worked for Pimlico Plumbers for six years until 2011, had already won an employment tribunal challenging the firm\u2019s view that he was self-employed. The court of appeal rejected an appeal lodged by Pimlico Plumbers, founded by the Conservative party donor Charlie Mullins. The firm argued Smith was an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d rather than a worker or employee. Smith\u2019s solicitor, Jacqueline McGuigan, said the ruling held wider implications for gig economy firms such as Deliveroo or Uber, both of which are embroiled in rows over employment status. \u201cWe are absolutely delighted,\u201d McGuigan said. \u201cThe decision brings welcome clarity to the issue of employment status relating to work in parts of the economy.\u201d Speaking outside court, Mullins said: \u201cI am happy. This gives some clarity. We will be looking at the full judgment and there is a good chance we will appeal to the supreme court.\u201d The UK\u2019s department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: \u201cWe are determined to make sure our employment rules keep up to date to reflect new ways of working, and that\u2019s why the government asked Matthew Taylor to conduct an independent review into modern working practices.\u201d But BEIS immediately came under fire from the Green party for failing to publish a report that warned in December 2015 that gig economy workers were at risk of exploitation. A string of labour disputes have since arisen as staff from firms such as Uber, Deliveroo and CitySprint have fought to have their status upgraded to that of workers or employees. The report, commissioned by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, warned that a lack of clarity over workers\u2019 status was allowing \u201cunscrupulous\u201d employers to take advantage of workers. It explored possibilities including \u201cflipping\u201d the burden of proof in labour disputes, so that employment tribunals would consider complainants to be full employees unless a different relationship could be established. \u201cSome of the more unscrupulous employers will also have to start to take notice if a significant proportion of their workforce stand up for what is rightfully theirs as a result,\u201d it said. The Green party said the government\u2019s failure to publish the report since it was completed in December 2015 had increased uncertainty for gig economy workers and forced them to take the risk of going to tribunal. \u201cIt is shameful that Tory ministers have sat on the findings of the coalition\u2019s review into employment status,\u201d said Green co-leader Jonathan Bartley, who wrote to the prime minister in October calling for the report to be published. \u201cAs they did so workers everywhere have been living in increasing insecurity and left to fend for themselves.\u201d Asked why the report had been delayed, BEIS said it had been commissioned to \u201cexplore future options\u201d and would help inform the Taylor review into employment status, which was launched a year after the report was published. Employment law experts said the Pimlico Plumbers ruling would have significant implications for the ongoing dispute over employment status. Natalie Razeen, employment law solicitor at Russell-Cooke, said the decision \u201csuggests that courts are alive to the inequality of bargaining power faced by individuals in these circumstances. \u201cThis serves as yet another reminder to employers that they should consider the question of employment or worker status carefully.\u201d Marian Bloodworth, employment partner at Kemp Little, said the judgment highlighted the need for legal clarity around the status of those working on a self-employed basis and in the gig economy. \u201cTribunals and courts are increasingly willing to look behind the labels businesses use for their staff and will take into account the reality of the working arrangements and relationships,\u201d she said. The ruling is the latest decision to be handed down in a series of court challenges launched by gig economy workers who feel they should get the same benefits as full-time employees, such as holiday pay and pension. A cycle courier working for the delivery firm CitySprint won the right earlier this year to paid holidays and minimum pay. Food delivery firm Deliveroo was told last year it must pay its workers the minimum wage unless they are ruled self-employed by a court or HM Revenue &amp; Customs. The Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain has written to Deliveroo on behalf of a group of couriers in Brighton, serving two weeks\u2019 notice to offer better pay and more hours. The group has also had a message of support from the GMB union. Ride-hailing app Uber lost the right to designate its drivers as self-employed last year, in a ruling it has since appealed against. Maria Ludkin, the GMB\u2019s legal director, said: \u201cThis case, like the Uber case last October, is yet another victory for the bogus self-employed who have been treated appallingly by their employer. \u201cAll they want is basic employment rights as are enjoyed by the majority, including the right to be paid a minimum wage and holiday pay.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 February 2017 to clarify that the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain is organising Deliveroo riders in Brighton.",

      "bodyText": "It is being billed as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest floating private members\u2019 club\u201d. A 220-metre-long superyacht where the cost of a room for the night starts at about \u00a32,000, offering wealthy clients the chance to tour the globe calling in at glamour events from the Monaco Grand Prix to the Rio carnival. Five billionaire friends have paid \u20ac10m (\u00a38.5m) each towards the cost of building the luxury yacht, in return for a suite. Most of the \u20ac250m bill will be borne by wealthy concierge firm Quintessentially, which will operate the ship as a seaborne private club for its elite members. As well as hosting parties the yacht \u2013 which planned to launch in 2013 but struggled to attract enough funding \u2013 will operate as a hotel, with a restaurant run with the Mayfair institution The Wolseley. Aaron Simpson, Quintessentially\u2019s co-founder and chairman, said he hit upon the idea of building the firm\u2019s own yacht after finding it difficult to cater to wealthy clients when they all descend on the same high-profile events at the same time. \u201cIt will travel the globe to where the wealthy want to go and be seen,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cWe know the events where there is huge demand and not enough supply. \u201cIt will be the world\u2019s largest floating private membership club,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere the traditional cruise model is to go somewhere, dock and get off; we will dock and people will want to get on.\u201d Quintessentially has secured debt financing from Norway and Italy, where the yacht will be built and fitted out. The yacht, which will be 40m longer than the world\u2019s biggest private vessel Azzam, owned by United Arab Emirates ruler Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is due to make its maiden voyage in 2019-2020. Simpson envisages the yacht, to be named Quintessentially One, hosting exclusive parties with famous performers putting in a star turn. He points out that Quintessentially has long-standing ties with artists such as Elton John, who it has booked to sing at its ultra-wealthy clients previous birthdays. The five billionaires, who Simpson said would remain anonymous \u201cuntil a bottle of champagne hits the hull\u201d, will each own a suite, including some which span three floors. Some suites will cover 100 sq m. Quintessentially members can stay in onboard hotel rooms starting at about \u00a32,000 a night. Although Simpson conceded such a bill was \u201ca lot\u201d he said, \u201cTry finding a room for that [during the Monaco Grand Prix weekend].\u201d Elite membership costs \u00a315,000-a-year. There is one problem, however. At 220m long Quintessentially One will be so big it won\u2019t fit into Monaco\u2019s harbour, or many others on its global itinerary, and will have to weigh anchor out at sea with guests ferried to land in launches. Ports of call listed for its first few voyages include the Bahamas, Ibiza and Miami. It is not the first yacht to provide a floating home for billionaires. In 2002, the wealthy were able to buy homes on The World, the largest residential yacht on Earth at 196.5m long, which claims residents can \u201ctravel the globe without ever leaving home\u201d. The World, on which 142 families reside in 165 apartments, is constantly on the move and circumnavigates the globe every two-to-three years. A 200-strong crew cater to residents, some of whom spend most of the year on board while others join for specific expeditions. The boat has recently returned from a trip to Antarctica, where it broke the record for the most southerly navigation, reaching a point within the Bay of Whales in the Ross Sea.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers and construction firms had a December bounce, adding to evidence that the UK economy ended 2016 on a strong note despite the Brexit vote. Backing up official estimates that show the UK economy was the fastest growing of the G7 leading industrial countries last year, figures published on Friday came in stronger than City economists expected. Alongside news of the increase for construction and manufacturing output, the Office for National Statistics also published data showing the UK\u2019s trade gap narrowed in December as exports grew faster than imports. The ONS estimates overall GDP grew 0.6% in the final quarter of 2016, matching the pace in the previous two quarters and suggesting the economy remained resilient to any uncertainty sparked by June\u2019s vote to leave the EU. The Scotiabank economist Alan Clarke said the latest data meant growth estimates for the final quarter were being revised up to 0.7%. The figures also vindicated the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) forecasts for the UK economy published last week, he added. \u201cWe all thought the BoE were mad when they came out with a 2% growth forecast for this year. They may come out of this looking very smart,\u201d said Clarke. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said that using the latest available figures on the UK economy, it estimated GDP grew 0.7% in the three months to the end of January, up from 0.6% in the three months to the end of December. \u201cGrowth was driven by robust consumer spending combined with a pickup in output in production industries,\u201d said Oriol Carreras, a research fellow. But NIESR still sees growth slowing compared with last year\u2019s 2% expansion. \u201cDespite our estimates indicating a strong start of 2017, we expect economic growth to soften to 1.7% this year as rising consumer price inflation weighs on consumer spending.\u201d The ONS said manufacturing output \u2013 which accounts for about a tenth of GDP \u2013 jumped 2.1% in December, much faster than the 0.5% growth forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. Output was up 4% on a year earlier, the strongest growth since April 2014. In the wider industrial sector, which in addition to manufacturing includes activities such as mining, output picked up by 1.1% from November, compared with a 0.2% forecast. The sector\u2019s 4.3% year-on-year growth was the fastest since January 2011. Other figures showed Britain\u2019s goods trade deficit fell to \u00a310.89bn in December, narrower than the \u00a311.5bn forecast. But the ONS noted there was little evidence of any impact on the trade balance so far from the drop in the pound since the referendum, which makes UK exports cheaper to overseas buyers. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, described the narrowing in the trade deficit as encouraging and highlighted a rise in exports of goods to non-EU countries. \u201cHowever, there is still work to do to change the overall trend and to keep UK exports on an upward trajectory,\u201d he said. The construction figures \u2013 covering about 6% of the economy \u2013 showed output rose 1.8% in December and 0.2% in the final quarter of 2016 \u2013 primarily a result of stronger commercial work in December and new housing work over the quarter. Economists had forecast a smaller 1% rise in output for December. The ONS noted the pound had dropped 17% compared with a basket of other currencies between the final quarters of 2015 and 2016 but that the latest data showed \u201clittle response\u201d, with the trade balance actually widening over the same period. It said that widening was a result of fairly large increases in the value of exports and imports \u2013 9.8% and 11.3% respectively. The latest figures for December will fuel hopes the UK economy is on a solid footing moving further into 2017, when Brexit negotiations begin in earnest. But more timely indicators suggest firms faced tougher conditions over the month of January. A clutch of closely watched surveys last week showed companies were grappling with big increases in costs as the weak pound makes imports to the UK such as fuel, metals and food ingredients more expensive. \u201cWhile industrial production and manufacturing output has proved resilient into the end of 2016, its sustainability over 2017 is in question,\u201d said Barclays economists Fabrice Montagn\u00e9 and Andrzej Szczepaniak. They noted surveys showing inflationary pressures are at multi-year highs \u201cwhich could weigh further on already bleak domestic demand\u201d and signs that any fillip to exports from a weak pound was coming to an end. \u201cFinally, during the the first quarter of 2017, when it is anticipated that article 50 will be triggered, we expect firms to become more cautious given the increasing likelihood of a hard Brexit following [Theresa] May\u2019s speech on 17 January claiming the UK would leave the European single market and the EU customs union,\u201d they added.",

    "webTitle": "Scottish Power customers to be hit by 7.8% price hike", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than a million Scottish Power customers will see their energy bills rise by \u00a386 a year after it became the third of the big six energy suppliers to announce a price hike. But British Gas, the biggest energy supplier, announced on Friday that it would freeze prices until August, contrary to recent reports that it was planning a rise of up to 9%. Scottish Power blamed increasing wholesale energy prices for the 7.8% rise in dual fuel prices, which comes a week after npower\u2019s rise of 9.8% and a couple of months after EDF\u2019s 1.2% hike. Switching sites said the rise marked a \u201cdark day\u201d and \u201cbitter blow\u201d for billpayers. The increases have come despite warnings from energy regulator Ofgem that there is no reason for price rises this early. The run of hikes has prompted calls by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, for a price cap. Scottish Power\u2019s changes would see a third of its customers hit on average with a 10.8% price increase in electricity and a 4.7% rise in gas. The prices take effect for households on standard variable tariffs from 31 March, a few weeks after the npower and EDF rises. Colin McNeill, Scottish Power\u2019s UK retail director, said: \u201cThis price change follows months of cost increases that have already led to significant rises in fixed price products that now unfortunately have to be reflected in standard prices.\u201d The company broke down the \u00a386 rise, saying \u00a354 was a result of the higher wholesale prices, \u00a318 for government levies for environmental schemes, \u00a310 for smart metering and \u00a34 for VAT. The company said its hedging strategy on buying energy had meant the \u00a354 cost of wholesale energy was \u00a375 cheaper than it would have been otherwise. Dermot Nolan, Ofgem\u2019s chief executive, last month said suppliers\u2019 costs had increased 15% but because of the way the big six hedged, there was no reason for them to pass on the costs. A spokeswoman on Friday said: \u201cOfgem\u2019s recent analysis did not show a case for significant price increases for standard variable tariffs where suppliers have bought energy well in advance.\u201d British Gas customers will enjoy a reprieve from the price hikes, the first increases in three years. The company, which has 5 million customers, said it was able to freeze its standard variable tariff because it had \u201csignificantly\u201d reduced its own costs. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to give our customers on standard tariffs the peace of mind that the price they\u2019re paying will remain unchanged until August,\u201d said Mark Hodges, chief executive of a new consumer division at British Gas\u2019s parent company, Centrica. Martin Lewis, founder of finance site MoneySavingExpert.com, said pressure on suppliers meant it was now inevitable the rest of the big six would follow suit. \u201cThe British Gas sticking plaster of a freeze is good news as it does provide some temporary respite, though again, unless there are major shifts in the world market it is virtually unthinkable that a rise won\u2019t happen eventually,\u201d he said. Switching site MoneySuperMarket said it was \u201cclearly open season\u201d on energy price movements, and urged consumers to switch to cheaper fixed deals. The increases will add pressure on the government to take a more interventionist stance on the energy market, as Theresa May and business secretary Greg Clark had previously indicated they were considering. \u201cMillions of hard-pressed energy bill payers are continuing to suffer due to a lack of competition in this market,\u201d said Alex Neill, managing director of home and legal services at consumer group Which? \u201cIf energy companies fail to properly engage with their customers, then the government and the regulator must step in.\u201d Jefferies, the investment bank, said this week that the tariff rises meant there was an increased chance the government could intervene in the market.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump may have found the perfect golf partner in the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe. If rumours about the US president\u2019s fairway gamesmanship are to be believed, Abe is likely to turn a blind eye to any skullduggery on the links in Florida this weekend. Although Tokyo won assurances of Washington\u2019s commitment to Japan\u2019s security from the defence secretary, James Mattis, last weekend, the thorny issue of trade is likely to cast a pall over the leaders\u2019 summit, which begins in Washington later on Friday and ends with a round of golf at the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a round of golf, which is a great thing,\u201d Trump said in an interview this week with Westwood One Sports Radio. \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing about golf \u2013 you get to know somebody better on a golf course than you will over lunch.\u201d He has promised that he and Abe will have \u201ca lot of fun\u201d, but what has been billed as a friendly game \u201cbetween partners\u201d could take on a more competitive edge if the leaders\u2019 personal rapport fails to bring them together on trade. Trump has blasted Japanese auto trade practices as unfair, and claimed, incorrectly, that Japan imposes tariffs that make it \u201cimpossible to sell American cars in Japan\u201d. He also criticised plans by Toyota to build a new plant in Mexico, and suggested he would impose a \u201cborder tax\u201d on companies that based themselves outside the US. Officials in Washington have not dismissed the possibility that Trump will take Abe to task over the trade imbalance and what he has described as deliberate attempts by Tokyo to devalue the yen to gain an unfair trade advantage over the US. Abe will not go to Washington empty-handed. Accompanied by his foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, and finance minister, Taro Aso, he is expected to directly appeal to Trump by unveiling an ambitious policy package that could create 700,000 US jobs through private-public investment in high-speed trains and other infrastructure. Trump is reportedly willing to reciprocate by proposing a bilateral free trade deal that would replace the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation agreement that Trump ripped up as soon as he moved into the White House. Demonstrating a commitment to American jobs is \u201cpart of Japan\u2019s efforts to explain to Trump that it is a friendly nation\u201d in both security and trade, according to Mikitaka Masuyama, a politics professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies. But having smoothed his path to the White House with repeated promises to put \u201cAmerica first\u201d, Trump\u2019s protectionist instincts will not have been calmed by new data showing that the US trade deficit with Japan grew to $68.94bn (\u00a355bn) last year. With so much at stake, Abe is one of the few world leaders to have refrained from criticising Trump\u2019s immigration policy. Instead, he will appeal to Trump\u2019s business instincts with cautiously worded reminders of Japanese automakers\u2019 huge investments in the US economy. This weekend\u2019s talks are the culmination of an Abe charm offensive that began with a meeting with the then president-elect at Trump Tower in New York in November, during which the two men laid the foundations for their \u201cgolf diplomacy\u201d. Trump gave Abe a golf shirt; the prime minister reciprocated with a $3,700 gold-coloured golf club. Abe returned from New York claiming that Trump was a leader in whom the world could have confidence, yet just weeks later, the president prompted despair in Tokyo when he made good on a campaign promise to pull the US out of the TPP. With little hope that the deal can be resurrected, Abe will arrive armed with an array of statistics he hopes will refute claims that US-Japan trade is a one-way street. This weekend\u2019s jaunt to Florida, for which Trump is reportedly footing the bill, will not be the first time Japanese and US leaders have attempted to bond over a game of golf. As prime minister, Abe\u2019s grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, played Dwight Eisenhower in Maryland in 1957 in what the media described as a \u201ctriumph of diplomacy\u201d between the former wartime enemies, and which paved the way for today\u2019s \u201cunshakeable\u201d military alliance. Abe, a member of the prestigious Three Hundred Club near Tokyo, where membership fees are as high as 80m yen ($715,000) a year, has kept his handicap a secret, but is rumoured to be no better than an average weekend golfer. That is just as well. As he seeks concessions from Trump, the Japanese leader would do well to remember that on his grandfather\u2019s outing on the links six decades ago, it was Eisenhower who emerged victorious.",

    "webTitle": "Coalition urged to charge 10% royalty on offshore oil and gas projects", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Turnbull government must introduce a 10% royalty on all offshore oil and gas projects in Australia to ensure taxpayers start getting a fair return on their natural resources, the Tax Justice Network says. The group has called for the petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) to be overhauled, saying there were too many opportunities under its regime for offshore oil and gas companies to exploit transfer pricing, with direct impacts on PRRT credits and profits. In a submission to the PRRT review, the Tax Justice Network said a 10% royalty ought to be applied to offshore oil and gas projects in commonwealth waters that were only subject to the PRRT. It said a 10% royalty needed to be charged because the PRRT \u2013 which was designed in the 1980s for crude oil projects, but which had failed to keep up with developments in the industry \u2013 was failing to collect adequate revenue. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, admitted last year that revenues from the PRRT had halved since 2012-13, and crude oil excise collections had fallen by more than half. He announced a formal review of the PRRT regime in November after a rapid decline in revenues from the tax. Jason Ward, from the network, said a 10% royalty would raise between $4bn and $6bn over the next four years. He said the royalty system should be similar to existing state and Commonwealth royalties that already apply to all other oil and gas projects in Australia. It should be deductible from PRRT, and the PRRT should remain as a backstop to collect additional revenue if and when prices increased substantially and when existing PRRT credits were exhausted. \u201cWith Australia poised to be the world\u2019s largest exporter of LNG but projected to generate little direct government revenue for decades, there is a major problem that needs to be addressed,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment projects in commonwealth waters are getting millions of tonnes of LNG effectively for free. \u201cNo other industry, including coal, iron ore and onshore gas, get given the total cost of their investment (plus uplift) in free resources before they begin paying for that resource. \u201cThis policy will level the playing field across the oil and gas industry. At the moment projects in commonwealth waters are getting a competitive advantage over onshore projects and the north-west shelf who pay much higher royalties. \u201cAll of the major companies, Shell, Chevron, BHP, Woodside and BP, already pay under our proposed model through their ownership of the north-west shelf project. They have been happy to pay under this model for years without complaint. The north-west shelf shows they still make huge profits under this type of royalty regime.\u201d Ward said mature oil projects, such as BHP in the Bass Strait who already pay PRRT, would not be affected given the royalty would be fully deductible from the PRRT. \u201cThis proposal we believe ensures a fair return to the Australian people while still encouraging investment by maintaining our royalty regime as one of the most generous in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe call on the industry to support this proposal to the commonwealth government.\u201d The problems raised by the Tax Justice Network are similar to those raised by tax expert Dr Diane Kraal, from Monash University. Her submission warned flaws in the PRRT regime meant Chevron\u2019s giant Gorgon gas project off WA would not pay the tax until \u201cat least 2030\u201d, despite decades of operation. Kraal said her modelling showed $5bn in revenue would be raised from Gorgon alone by 2030 if royalties were reintroduced. She said her research indicated other natural gas projects in commonwealth waters should also be subject to commonwealth royalties, including Chevron\u2019s Wheatstone, Woodside\u2019s Pluto LNG project, and Inpex\u2019s Ichthys project. Woodside Petroleum used its submission to argue against any changes to the PRRT. It said the PRRT had been operating as intended, despite declining revenues from the tax recently. It said the regime had delivered $200bn worth of projects over the past decade, and Woodside had paid $2bn in PRRT since 2001. \u201cAs a profits-based tax, it is not unusual to have declining PRRT at a time of declining oil and gas prices and prior to these projects recouping their costs,\u201d its submission said. \u201cWoodside pays billions of dollars of taxes in Australia. The PRRT is just one part of our tax contribution but increasing it could put other tax revenues at risk by making future projects unviable. \u201cWoodside has an ownership stake in three of Australia\u2019s major undeveloped gas resources. As the leading Australian gas producer, we want to develop these resources and deliver significant benefits to the Australian people. \u201cWe urge the PRRT review team to consider carefully the substantial impact of any changes to the current fiscal settings that could jeopardise existing and future investments.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Turnbull government must introduce a 10% royalty on all offshore oil and gas projects in Australia to ensure taxpayers start getting a fair return on their natural resources, the Tax Justice Network says.</p> <p>The group has called for the petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) to be overhauled, saying there were too many opportunities under its regime for offshore oil and gas companies to exploit transfer pricing, with direct impacts on PRRT credits and profits.<br></p> <p>In a submission to the <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov.au/ConsultationsandReviews/Reviews/2016/Review-of-the-Petroleum-Resource-Rent-Tax\">PRRT review</a>, the Tax Justice Network said a 10% royalty ought to be applied to offshore oil and gas projects in commonwealth waters that were only subject to the PRRT.</p> <p>It said a 10% royalty needed to be charged because the PRRT \u2013 which was designed in the 1980s for crude oil projects, but which had failed to keep up with developments in the industry \u2013 was failing to collect adequate revenue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/09/australia-must-charge-royalties-on-natural-gas-or-lose-billions-says-expert\">Australia must charge royalties on natural gas or lose billions, says expert</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The treasurer, Scott Morrison, admitted last year that revenues from the PRRT had halved since 2012-13, and crude oil excise collections had fallen by more than half. </p> <p>He announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/30/petroleum-tax-review-announced-by-coalition-after-revenue-plunges\">formal review of the PRRT regime in November</a> after a rapid decline in revenues from the tax.</p> <p>Jason Ward, from the network, said a 10% royalty would raise between $4bn and $6bn over the next four years.</p> <p>He said the royalty system should be similar to existing state and Commonwealth royalties that already apply to all other oil and gas projects in Australia.</p> <p>It should be deductible from PRRT, and the PRRT should remain as a backstop to collect additional revenue if and when prices increased substantially and when existing PRRT credits were exhausted.</p> <p>\u201cWith Australia poised to be the world\u2019s largest exporter of LNG but projected to generate little direct government revenue for decades, there is a major problem that needs to be addressed,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment projects in commonwealth waters are getting millions of tonnes of LNG effectively for free.</p> <p>\u201cNo other industry, including coal, iron ore and onshore gas, get given the total cost of their investment (plus uplift) in free resources before they begin paying for that resource.</p> <p>\u201cThis policy will level the playing field across the oil and gas industry. At the moment projects in commonwealth waters are getting a competitive advantage over onshore projects and the north-west shelf who pay much higher royalties.</p> <p>\u201cAll of the major companies, Shell, Chevron, BHP, Woodside and BP, already pay under our proposed model through their ownership of the north-west shelf project. They have been happy to pay under this model for years without complaint. The north-west shelf shows they still make huge profits under this type of royalty regime.\u201d</p> <p>Ward said mature oil projects, such as BHP in the Bass Strait who already pay PRRT, would not be affected given the royalty would be fully deductible from the PRRT.</p> <p>\u201cThis proposal we believe ensures a fair return to the Australian people while still encouraging investment by maintaining our royalty regime as one of the most generous in the world,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe call on the industry to support this proposal to the commonwealth government.\u201d</p> <p>The problems raised by the Tax Justice Network are similar to those raised by tax expert Dr Diane Kraal, from Monash University.</p> <p>Her submission warned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/09/australia-must-charge-royalties-on-natural-gas-or-lose-billions-says-expert\">flaws in the PRRT regime</a> meant Chevron\u2019s giant Gorgon gas project off WA would not pay the tax until \u201cat least 2030\u201d, despite decades of operation.</p> <p>Kraal said her modelling showed $5bn in revenue would be raised from Gorgon alone by 2030 if royalties were reintroduced. </p> <p>She said her research indicated other natural gas projects in commonwealth waters should also be subject to commonwealth royalties, including Chevron\u2019s Wheatstone, Woodside\u2019s Pluto LNG project, and Inpex\u2019s Ichthys project.</p> <p>Woodside Petroleum used its <a href=\"http://www.woodside.com.au/Investors-Media/Documents/08.02.2017%20Woodside%20response%20to%20PRRT%20Review.pdf\">submission</a> to argue against any changes to the PRRT.</p> <p>It said the PRRT had been operating as intended, despite declining revenues from the tax recently.</p> <p>It said the regime had delivered $200bn worth of projects over the past decade, and Woodside had paid $2bn in PRRT since 2001.</p> <p>\u201cAs a profits-based tax, it is not unusual to have declining PRRT at a time of declining oil and gas prices and prior to these projects recouping their costs,\u201d its submission said.</p> <p>\u201cWoodside pays billions of dollars of taxes in Australia. The PRRT is just one part of our tax contribution but increasing it could put other tax revenues at risk by making future projects unviable.</p> <p>\u201cWoodside has an ownership stake in three of Australia\u2019s major undeveloped gas resources. As the leading Australian gas producer, we want to develop these resources and deliver significant benefits to the Australian people. </p> <p>\u201cWe urge the PRRT review team to consider carefully the substantial impact of any changes to the current fiscal settings that could jeopardise existing and future investments.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A generation gap in attitudes towards cooking and eating is helping to fuel the UK\u2019s food waste mountain, research reveals, driven by time-poor millennials who do not understand the value of the food on their plate. In contrast to savvy older consumers familiar with post-war rationing, the study suggests, those aged 18 to 34 are preoccupied by the visual presentation of food to photograph and share on social media while failing to plan meals, buying too much and then throwing it away. The UK churns out 15m tonnes of food waste a year \u2013 of which 7m tonnes come from households. The estimated retail value of this is a staggering \u00a37.5bn, and the government\u2019s waste advisory body, Wrap, calculates that a typical family wastes \u00a3700 of food a year. A national supermarket study of the food waste patterns of 5,050 UK consumers, published on Friday, reveals nearly two-fifths of those aged over 65 say they never waste food, compared with just 17% of those under 35. The research by Sainsbury\u2019s found more than half (55%) of 18- to 34-year-olds had a \u201clive to eat\u201d attitude to food \u2013 more about pleasure than necessity but with higher shopping bills and more waste. Older generations were more likely to \u201ceat to live\u201d with lower grocery bills and reduced waste. Millennials \u2013 those born in or after the mid-1980s \u2013 were also the most likely to try unusual recipes to create Instagram-friendly dishes, involving exotic ingredients that are harder to reuse. \u201cA post-war increase in household food waste is due to changes in how we value choice, time and money in relation to food,\u201d said food historian and broadcaster Dr Polly Russell. \u201cGone are the days of eating the same food, on the same days of the week, week in, week out. Most people today, particularly younger generations, demand variety. However, with a menu which changes often, it is more challenging to control waste and plan ahead.\u201d The over-55s are the most comfortable in the kitchen, the survey found, with just 18% wishing they knew more about managing and cooking food. In contrast, more than half of those aged 18 to 34 admit a lack of culinary know-how. When it comes to throwing away leftovers, 18- to 34-year-olds are the most likely culprits, with 17% of them leaving leftovers three or more times a week. Younger consumers also fail to plan ahead. Some 20% of those under 35 admit to wasting the most food after a big shopping trip, compared with 8% of 55- to 64-year-olds and just 7% of the 65-plus age group. The findings are part of Sainsbury\u2019s \u00a310m \u201cwaste less, save more\u201d scheme to help households save money by cutting food waste. It is awaiting the results of a year-long trial in the Derbyshire market town of Swadlincote, which was chosen as a testbed for reducing household food waste.",
