    "webTitle": "HSBC to reveal plans over UK headquarters in face of bank levy", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "HSBC, the biggest payer of the UK banking levy, will set out on Tuesday exactly how it plans to decide whether to keep its headquarters in Britain in remarks that will be closely watched by George Osborne as he prepares to deliver his Mansion House speech the following day to an audience of top bankers. Despite a last-ditch lobbying push, the chancellor is expected to offer his City audience plenty of warm words on Wednesday while at the same time holding firm on the banking levy, which was a manifesto pledge. Asked whether the chancellor was considering watering down his commitment to the levy, a Treasury spokesman said: \u201cWe are committed to maintaining our position as a global financial hub. And as set out at the budget, it is right that, as it becomes more profitable, our banking sector makes a fair contribution to fixing the public finances.\u201d HSBC will this week set out the methodology that will be used to determine whether to remain based the UK in a move that could reignite the debate about the wave of regulation that has imposed on the banking sector since the 2008 crisis. The bank levy and rules requiring a ringfence to be erected between high street operations and investment banking businesses are expected to be the agenda set out by Stuart Gulliver, the boss of HSBC, at his strategy day on Tuesday. He will be speaking just 24 hours before George Osborne is due to give his annual Mansion House address. The chancellor has faced intense calls from the finance industry to reconsider the scope of the levy which is imposed on the global balance sheets of banks, not just their UK operations. Employers body the CBI is suggesting a review of the levy \u2013 raised nine times since 2010 to ensure it meets the chancellor\u2019s revenue targets \u2013 may be warranted while the British Bankers\u2019 Association is calling for a review of taxation on the sector. Matthew Fell, CBI director for competitive markets, said: \u201cBanks play an important role in financing the economy and repeated changes to the bank levy in recent times have been unhelpful. A review of its scope could help to ensure our financial services industry stays competitive and boosts investment.\u201d Gulliver said last month that the criteria the bank would use to decide whether to move out the headquarters out of the UK \u2013 where it moved in 1992 from Hong Kong \u2013 would be published alongside his latest strategy for the bank. He is facing pressure from City investors to improve the returns of the bank, which has operations in more than 70 countries, by cutting costs and overhauling under-performing businesses. He is also battling to restore its reputation after a series of fines and an expos\u00e9 by the Guardian and other publications about the tax avoidance strategies deployed for customers of its its Swiss arm in the past. The review of the headquarters was first flagged in April and any change might impact as few as 250 roles or less. At Tuesday\u2019s strategy presentation Gulliver is also likely to face questions from analysts about his views on the high street business in the UK. The rules requiring a ringfence to be erected between between the retail and investment banking arms from 2019 has already sparked speculation that HSBC could spin off the UK business. Other high street banks have also been closing branches as customers more to digital banking. At the helm since 2011 after a 30 year career at the bank, Gulliver has listed four countries which need urgent attention: the US, Turkey, Brazil and Mexico. The Brazilian operation is up for sale although Gulliver has indicated that the troublesome US business will be restructured rather than sold off. Analysts also point to divisions which need tackling. The global banking markets arm \u2013 the investment bank \u2013 is also regarded by analysts as requiring attention. Gulliver has indicated parts of the businesses could be moved outside the UK. Analysts at Barclays said: \u201cLooking at HSBC from a divisional perspective shows that global banking and markets (GBM) consumes 45% of the group\u2019s capital but makes significantly below the required return. It also makes the lowest revenue return of the three main divisions,\u201d analysts at Barclays said. At his first strategy day in 2011, Gulliver signalled 25,000 job cuts from a global workforce that then stood at 296,000 and has now fallen to 257,600. Another 20,000 could be facing the axe.",

And as set out at the budget, it is right that, as it becomes more profitable, our banking sector makes a fair contribution to fixing the public finances.\u201d</p> <p>HSBC will this week set out the methodology that will be used to determine whether to remain based the UK in a move that could reignite the debate about the wave of regulation that has imposed on the banking sector since the 2008 crisis.</p> <p>The bank levy and rules requiring a ringfence to be erected between high street operations and investment banking businesses are expected to be the agenda set out by Stuart Gulliver, the boss of HSBC, at his strategy day on Tuesday.</p> <p>He will be speaking just 24 hours before George Osborne is due to give his annual Mansion House address. The chancellor has faced intense calls from the finance industry to reconsider the scope of the levy which is imposed on the global balance sheets of banks, not just their UK operations.</p> <p>Employers body the CBI is suggesting a review of the levy \u2013 raised nine times since 2010 to ensure it meets the chancellor\u2019s revenue targets \u2013 may be warranted while the British Bankers\u2019 Association is calling for a review of taxation on the sector.</p> <p>Matthew Fell, CBI director for competitive markets, said: \u201cBanks play an important role in financing the economy and repeated changes to the bank levy in recent times have been unhelpful. A review of its scope could help to ensure our financial services industry stays competitive and boosts investment.\u201d</p> <p>Gulliver said last month that the criteria the bank would use to decide whether to move out the headquarters out of the UK \u2013 where it moved in 1992 from Hong Kong \u2013 would be published alongside his latest strategy for the bank. <br></p> <p>He is facing pressure from City investors to improve the returns of the bank, which has operations in more than 70 countries, by cutting costs and overhauling under-performing businesses. He is also battling to restore its reputation after a series of fines and an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/08/hsbc-files-expose-swiss-bank-clients-dodge-taxes-hide-millions\">expos\u00e9 by the Guardian</a> and other publications about the tax avoidance strategies deployed for customers of its its Swiss arm in the past.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/08/hsbc-files-expose-swiss-bank-clients-dodge-taxes-hide-millions\">HSBC files show how Swiss bank helped clients dodge taxes and hide millions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The review of the headquarters was first flagged in April and any change might impact as few as 250 roles or less.</p> <p>At Tuesday\u2019s strategy presentation Gulliver is also likely to face questions from analysts about his views on the high street business in the UK. The rules requiring a ringfence to be erected between between the retail and investment banking arms from 2019 has already sparked speculation that HSBC could spin off the UK business. Other high street banks have also been closing branches as customers more to digital banking.</p> <p>At the helm since 2011 after a 30 year career at the bank, Gulliver has listed four countries which need urgent attention: the US, Turkey, Brazil and Mexico. The Brazilian operation is up for sale although Gulliver has indicated that the troublesome US business will be restructured rather than sold off.</p> <p>Analysts also point to divisions which need tackling. The global banking markets arm \u2013 the investment bank \u2013 is also regarded by analysts as requiring attention. Gulliver has indicated parts of the businesses could be moved outside the UK.</p> <p>Analysts at Barclays said: \u201cLooking at HSBC from a divisional perspective shows that global banking and markets (GBM) consumes 45% of the group\u2019s capital but makes significantly below the required return. It also makes the lowest revenue return of the three main divisions,\u201d analysts at Barclays said.</p> <p>At his first strategy day in 2011, Gulliver signalled 25,000 job cuts from a global workforce that then stood at 296,000 and has now fallen to 257,600. Another 20,000 could be facing the axe.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When his firm was going up against national companies for contracts to manage waste, Jon Free needed an edge to win the pitches. The answer he found was in the sense of community that existed among small businesses like his. By using his local currency, the Bristol pound, he saw companies were more willing to give their business to him and keep money flowing in the area. Launched almost three years ago, the community currency aims to keep money circulating among independent retailers and firms by encouraging people to use the local \u2018cash\u2019 instead of sterling, an idea that has inspired other towns and cities to take up similar schemes in the UK and abroad. \u201cTo be able to drop in and create a link to make [the money] a circular thing is a big part of it,\u201d the managing director of Waste Source said. \u201cTo say that we are registered with the Bristol pound shows that we are more community based.\u201d In use since 2012, the system operates as both notes and in electronic form with each Bristol pound equal to one pound sterling. Some 800 businesses in the Bristol area now use the community currency, with coffees, meals, council tax and even pole-dancing lessons paid for with it. \u201cThe practical vision was to get something which would connect local communities with their businesses in a way which kept money building up in their local communities,\u201d the currency\u2019s co-founder, Ciaran Mundy, said. \u201cWhat happens is that if you spend it at a large supermarket chain, 80% of that will exit the economy very quickly.\u201d While community currencies have a history going back to Victorian times, there has been a resurgence in recent years, with Bristol emerging as the standard-bearer in the UK. The system works by people exchanging their sterling for paper Bristol pounds \u2013 in single, five, 10 and 20 denominations \u2013 or by opening an account at the Bristol Credit Union. The currency can then be spent in participating businesses, or between businesses, in return for goods or services. So far, some \u00a31m has been issued in the community currency, according to Mundy, of which about \u00a3700,000 is still in circulation. As it is a voluntary scheme, the currency can switch between sterling and Bristol pounds, he said. The thinking behind the creation of the new currency, said Mundy, was to make a minor change to allow for more money to be spent in local areas. \u201cI was looking for a technological and cultural innovation which allows people to conduct themselves in a way which is more sustainable. A big part of that is being aware of the impact of your economic activity,\u201d he said. The paper notes are non-redeemable vouchers that expire and can only be spent with traders who will take them, but can\u2019t be swapped for cash at a bank. The digital currency is regulated like sterling and is treated in a similar way in accounts. \u201cIf you know, when you spend money \u2013 whatever form it is in \u2013 the impact that it is going to have because you know the people that you are spending it with, and you know the people that they are going to be spending it with, you are aware of the circumstances of the economy that surrounds you; it is a more transparent economy.\u201d The results of the community-oriented approach to money exchange is particularly evident in the city\u2019s restaurant sector where local growers who sell to local restaurants use the Bristol pound, said Mundy. The mayor of the city, George Ferguson, takes all of his salary in Bristol pounds. Which businesses can use it are dictated by a few broad rules. First, the business has to be in the area. Second, they cannot be listed on the stock exchange. \u201cThe criteria is: if you are mostly locally owned by people who live in the area. We have a postcode map drawn around the boundaries of where you can join the Bristol Credit Union \u2013 that area is about one million people,\u201d said Mundy. One large supermarket chain and other high street retailers, as well as a budget airline, have asked to be included in the Bristol pound scheme but were turned down, he added. The success in Bristol has led to similar schemes in other parts of the country, with 25 communities working on likeminded projects, including one in Liverpool. The ambition in Bristol, says Mundy, was to alter the financial system very slightly so that it works in favour of local business: \u201cOver the course of time you end up with some kind of fair and ecologically minded economy \u2026 and a more localised economy,\u201d he said. The Exeter pound is expected to launch at the beginning of September. Ian Martin, one of the organisers, said they hope to have 100 retailers using it at launch, initially using paper and then, later, digital transactions. \u201cThis sterling-backed model is very simple. It is simple because it appears on notes and it appears digitally,\u201d he said. \u201cYounger people tend to work digitally and older people tend to work with the notes but you need both to make it real. The advantage of the notes is that each piece is a local flyer, it makes it feel real to people but also it popularises it.\u201d The amount of money circulating in Bristol is still at a low level, although a local architects firm have recently billed the council for 900,000 Bristol pounds. Similar large-scale deals of the currency would see it blossom, said Mundy. \u201cIf we can get that type of procurement going, then we will have a very serious impact on the local economy and that is when we will see structural economic changes,\u201d he said. Jon Free\u2019s company cannot spend the currency with any of its suppliers so instead found another outlet for it: \u201cWe booked our Christmas do in December with a restaurant that accepted that and paid them in full for the evening, and that cleared a fair amount,\u201d he said. Barcelona takes on the idea A coalition of leftwing parties in Barcelona has taken inspiration from the Bristol model to propose a similar currency in the Spanish city. Also intended to benefit small and medium-sized companies, the organisers want to pay some salaries and benefits with the community currency and allow local taxes to be paid with it.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel and her guests will pose for the group photo and say all the right things at their press conferences. The richest nations in the world, they will say, have never been closer, never more united in their commitment to solving the pressing problems of today. Yes, it\u2019s that time of year again: the annual G7 summit. The get-togethers started after the first oil shock in the 1970s but have long since ceased to matter. The G7 is a moribund institution and has been for the past decade. As an instrument of the internationalism it was set up to pursue, it is hopeless. It should be scrapped. It takes a number of ingredients to make an international body work. There have to be problems that need solving. There has to be some degree of unanimity about how those problems should be solved. And there has to be leadership to ensure that unanimity when it is not immediately forthcoming. Only the first of those ingredients currently exists. The G7 has plenty to talk about: Greece; Ukraine; the next set of development goals and how to finance them; climate change; trade; the weakness of the global recovery; how to engineer the exit from the zero interest rate environment of the past six years; combating systematic tax evasion; and tackling inequality. David Cameron wants the Fifa scandal to prompt a wider discussion about corruption. What it does not have, and has not had since 2010, is a common view about how to go about achieving any of these aims. When the global financial crisis was raging, ideological differences did not matter. The G7 nations all cut interest rates and they all ran bigger budget deficits in an attempt to stimulate growth. But the consensus did not last, and divisions opened up. The Americans said growth should take priority over deficit reduction; the Germans, backed by the British, said that without a rapid return to fiscal rectitude there could be no sustainable growth. Nor has a dominant figure emerged who is prepared to take charge, someone prepared to chivvy the reluctant into agreeing to be ambitious in those areas where there is a degree of consensus, such as the repeated promises to support development in the world\u2019s poorest countries. The one G7 leader who could do this is Barack Obama, and the expectation was that he would take up the mantle of leadership when Gordon Brown lost power in 2010. The US president has proved unwilling or unable to do so, with the result that the G7 leaders meet, issue a vapid communique, and hotfoot it back to the airport as fast they can. For the past 14 years, the G7 has said it would spare no effort to complete the Doha round of trade liberalisation. It remains unfinished. The G7 is supposed to prevent beggar-thy-neighbour economic policies, yet its member countries are blatantly seeking to drive down their exchange rates to secure a competitive advantage. There are specific instances where the G7 could \u2013 and should \u2013 be using its collective muscle but is failing to do so. The summit in Bavaria will be followed by three global summits in the second half of 2015: the first in Addis Ababa will look at financing for development; the second in New York in September will set the United Nation\u2019s sustainable development goals (SDGs) for the next 15 years; the third in Paris in December will seek a legally binding deal on climate change agreed to by every nation. The G7 should be working backwards from Paris. It should begin by asking itself what sort of cuts in carbon emissions would be needed to prevent a damaging rise in global temperatures. Countries big and small, rich and poor, will all need to play their part in meeting this target and failure in Paris will make it a lot harder to meet the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals. So the next question is how to help poorer countries make their growth sustainable, through help to make the transition to low-carbon energy infrastructure. That has financial implications, hence the importance of the summit in Addis Ababa next month. A strong, confident G7 would be pledging money now, as it did at Gleneagles 10 years ago. That would increase the chances of the financing for development conference providing the money needed to achieve the SDGs and would vastly improve the chances of an ambitious outcome in Paris. Don\u2019t hold your breath. A second case for G7 action is Greece, where the risk of a default and possible exit from the eurozone has increased over the past week. Relations between Athens and its creditors have soured. Greece thinks the troika of the European commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund are making unfair demands that will damage the economy and are impossible politically. The troika thinks the Greeks are not serious about reforming their economy and that providing any more financial assistance will be throwing good money after bad. The G7 has been here before. In the 1990s, sub-Saharan African countries that had been poorly run found themselves burdened with debts that they had no hope of paying. Germany led the resistance to providing debt relief on the grounds that rewarding bad behaviour would simply lead to more of the same. Only after a protracted struggle was the opposition overcome. Negotiations between Greece and the troika have centred on short-term issues, such as how big a budget surplus the country should run once taking account of the interest payments on its debts. But as Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics has pointed out, the real issue is that Greece\u2019s debts are \u2013 like those of Tanzania or Zambia two decades ago \u2013 unpayable. Short of a miracle, Greece is going to need a big writedown. Greece currently has a debt to GDP ratio of 175%, but its creditors are assuming that it will grow by almost 3.5% a year on average in each of the next five years and that this will bring the debt ratio down to 120% of GDP, at which point the country might again be able to raise money in the financial markets. This is fantasy stuff. Greece is unlikely to grow at anything like these rates, especially if saddled with a fresh dose of austerity. The IMF knows this, which is why it has been pressing, so far unsuccessfully, for a debt write-off to be part of any new financial deal for Greece. Obama knows it, which is why the US Treasury has been putting pressure on Europe to strike a compromise agreement with Athens. A coalition that included Obama, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Cameron could put real pressure on Merkel. But it won\u2019t happen. Obama is not engaged enough. Hollande is too weak. Cameron needs Merkel to help him with his EU renegotiation. The G7 will wring its hands but do nothing. It has outlived its purpose.",

Don\u2019t hold your breath.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/07/troika-build-greece-up-not-blow-apart-ceasefire\">The troika is supposed to build Greece up, not blow it apart. Time for a ceasefire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A second case for G7 action is Greece, where the risk of a default and possible exit from the eurozone has increased over the past week. Relations between Athens and its creditors have soured. Greece thinks the troika of the European commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund are making unfair demands that will damage the economy and are impossible politically. The troika thinks the Greeks are not serious about reforming their economy and that providing any more financial assistance will be throwing good money after bad.</p> <p>The G7 has been here before. In the 1990s, sub-Saharan African countries that had been poorly run found themselves burdened with debts that they had no hope of paying. Germany led the resistance to providing debt relief on the grounds that rewarding bad behaviour would simply lead to more of the same. Only after a protracted struggle was the opposition overcome.</p> <p>Negotiations between Greece and the troika have centred on short-term issues, such as how big a budget surplus the country should run once taking account of the interest payments on its debts. But as Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics has pointed out, the real issue is that Greece\u2019s debts are \u2013 like those of Tanzania or Zambia two decades ago \u2013 unpayable. Short of a miracle, Greece is going to need a big writedown. Greece currently has a debt to GDP ratio of 175%, but its creditors are assuming that it will grow by almost 3.5% a year on average in each of the next five years and that this will bring the debt ratio down to 120% of GDP, at which point the country might again be able to raise money in the financial markets.</p> <p>This is fantasy stuff. Greece is unlikely to grow at anything like these rates, especially if saddled with a fresh dose of austerity. The IMF knows this, which is why it has been pressing, so far unsuccessfully, for a debt write-off to be part of any new financial deal for Greece. Obama knows it, which is why the US Treasury has been putting pressure on Europe to strike a compromise agreement with Athens. A coalition that included Obama, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Cameron could put real pressure on Merkel. But it won\u2019t happen. Obama is not engaged enough. Hollande is too weak. Cameron needs Merkel to help him with his EU renegotiation. The G7 will wring its hands but do nothing. It has outlived its purpose.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The phrase \u201ctrench warfare\u201d comes to mind. On Friday evening the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, lobbed some choice words at his foes in Brussels, calling their proposed debt deal \u201cabsurd\u201d. Days earlier, the International Monetary Fund had joined its allies in Brussels to fire a volley of criticism at Athens. The Greeks already had \u201csignificant flexibility\u201d to get out of their budget mess, IMF boss Christine Lagarde said, as she urged Athens to repay the \u20ac300m instalment of its bailout loan due on Friday. This could go on for several more weeks: Greece told the IMF it will have to wait until the end of the month to get its money, when it will \u201cbundle\u201d four payments together. And should the sides become more entrenched, this long-running war could still end in the disaster of Greek default. In Washington, where the IMF is hunkered down, and in Europe\u2019s finance ministries, the Greek stance is considered wilfully unreasonable. The Syriza government\u2019s demand for the return of national pay bargaining, a relaxed timetable for pension reform and a lower budget surplus than that demanded by the EU, the IMF and the European Central Bank are all but ridiculed in Berlin, Helsinki and Riga. As Greece\u2019s chief creditors, the EU and the IMF want Greece to adopt flexible labour markets, immediate restrictions on early retirement and a budget surplus big enough to accommodate some debt repayments. While much of what the radical leftists want seems unreasonable \u2013 especially the slow pace of pension reform, which in effect would allow tens of thousands of people in their late 50s to grab early retirement \u2013 it is the demands being made by Brussels and the IMF that are unconvincing and, worse, untenable. Running a larger budget surplus is only going to destroy Greece, not build it up. As US economist Joseph Stiglitz and many others, including former IMF staffers, have pointed out, the troika of creditors badly misjudged the economic effects of the programme they imposed in 2010 and 2012. \u201cThey believed that by cutting wages and accepting other austerity measures, Greek exports would increase and the economy would quickly return to growth,\u201d Stiglitz said last week. \u201cThey also believed that the first restructuring would lead to debt sustainability. The troika\u2019s forecasts have been wrong.\u201d The current proposals repeat the same mistake. Seven years after the crash, the Greek economy is still 25% smaller than it was at its previous peak, 10% of households have no electricity and youth unemployment is running at more than 50%. Tsipras and his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, may specialise in needling their creditors, but the troika also need to take into account the fact that Syriza has formed a legitimate, democratically elected government and cannot be told that its electoral programme is irrelevant. So Lagarde and European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker must be the ones to table further compromises. Neither was in charge when the first Greek bailout set all sides on the current disastrous path. They should explain to Ireland and Portugal, also suffering austerity, that Greece is too weak to survive more bloodletting. According to one estimate, Brussels needs to sanction only an additional \u20ac10bn of loans to get Athens through the next few months, after which a longer-lasting deal can be constructed. The troika should create the funds and stop insisting on surpluses as a prelude to meaningful talks. Lagarde\u2019s plan is simply too severe. This is not about letting a leftist government off the hook, but about giving it more time. Much more time. Giorgos Stathakis, one of many former academics in the Syriza government, said last week: \u201cWe have a mandate from the Greek people to go on, to try to change the terms of the agreement.\u201d He and his colleagues are not going to give up on democracy, and as the end-of-June deadline draws closer, creditors should show the Greek people more respect. It\u2019s time for a truce. HSBC should focus on its jewel in the East Here\u2019s a good idea that (almost certainly) will not be announced by HSBC at its big strategy day on Tuesday: split the bank in two, and let only the Asian business base itself in Hong Kong. UBS analyst John-Paul Crutchley is the author of the inspired demerger idea, which starts by arguing that \u201ctaking the accumulated baggage of the last three decades home may not be the best course of action\u201d. Baggage may seem a harsh description of the non-Asian parts of HSBC, including its UK retail banking operation, but Crutchley reckons the Hong Kong Asia-Pacific bank accounts for 80% of HSBC\u2019s market valuation while deploying less than half the equity. It is the jewel. Indeed, the analyst reckons HSBC\u2019s share price could be twice the current 619p if the group had decided in the 1980s to stick with its Asian franchise and not pursue all the deals and acquisitions elsewhere. That observation illustrates the fact that HSBC management\u2019s head-scratching over where to base the bank is something of a sideshow. Dodging the full impact of the UK bank levy by redomiciling the whole shebang to Hong Kong might save $1bn a year. But, even if one assumes such a saving is worth $12bn in today\u2019s money, that\u2019s only the equivalent of 44p on the share price. The bigger question is: what\u2019s the best way to manage this vast sprawling group? A demerger is not a cure-all but it would deliver a few advantages. The Hong Kong end could concentrate on combating increased competition from Chinese banks. Rump HSBC could be more vigorous in allocating capital to the parts of the business generating better returns. And, since regulators are piling heavier capital and compliance costs on very big global banks, both bits might benefit from being part of smaller organisations. It\u2019s an idea HSBC is highly unlikely to adopt. But a dose of bold thinking is arguably exactly what it needs to awaken a slumbering share price. Flogging the Brazilian and Turkish operations \u2013 Tuesday\u2019s likely highlights \u2013 probably won\u2019t be enough to excite shareholders. How US oil poured cold water on hopes for a climate deal Staving off catastrophic climate change is going to require a global effort that unites disparate corporate and sovereign entities. So it is deflating to see a welcome outbreak of common sense from some major oil groups overshadowed by dissent from powerful rivals. When six of Europe\u2019s largest oil and gas companies, including BP and Royal Dutch Shell, expressed backing for a global carbon pricing system last month, it boosted hopes that the fossil fuel industry was getting serious about fighting global warming. But last week the head of US company Chevron attacked the initiative, saying it would not work because consumers would not tolerate high energy prices. Its larger peer, ExxonMobil, has also shunned a joint industry stance. If this dissonance is replicated among global governments, there is little hope for a substantive deal at the UN climate change conference in Paris later this year. Big oil has lost its chance to set an example.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a measure of the triumph of the pro-austerity argument in Britain that George Osborne presented his latest round of cuts in the Commons last week \u2013 a down payment on the \u00a325bn he plans to make over the next three years \u2013 as a \u201cculture of good housekeeping\u201d in government. Austerity as common sense. With a historic general election victory under their belts, and Labour still obsessed with repudiating their own general election manifesto \u2013 and even trashing spending decisions Gordon Brown made seven or eight years ago \u2013 the Tories have a wide open field. But the forthcoming onslaught on the public services cannot be left unopposed. First, the spending squeeze the Tories now hope to implement, starting in the current financial year, is intense, as the spreadsheet wizards at the Institute for Fiscal Studies made clear last week. Shortly before Osborne\u2019s statement, Carl Emmerson, the IFS\u2019s deputy director, warned that achieving the Tories\u2019 planned cuts would be \u201canything but easy\u201d. Rising cost pressures, not least an ageing society, and protections for cherished areas, including the NHS and overseas aid, mean the pain for other departments will be severe. By 2015, if Osborne proceeds as planned, the budgets of \u201cunprotected\u201d departments, including the Home Office and Department for Business, will be more than 30% lower in real terms than when the 2010 coalition came to power. As the Institute for Government\u2019s Julian McCrae spelled out at the same seminar, there are already warning signs that parts of the public services are creaking. He cited a sharp increase in waiting times at hospital accident and emergency departments, and rising violent assaults in prisons as staff numbers are cut, as examples. So far, surveys suggest the public are only reporting modest deteriorations in services as a result of the past five years\u2019 savings. But as the attrition continues, opinion is likely to shift. Certainly Nicola Sturgeon was able to win a significant hearing for her anti-austerity stance during the election campaign, albeit that the details of the SNP\u2019s spending plans didn\u2019t quite support her fiery rhetoric. Second, the belt-tightening is likely to be profoundly unfair. Osborne has repeatedly said his cuts plan will involve a \u00a312bn reduction in the welfare bill. Since pensioners are protected, and out-of-work benefits are a relatively small part of the \u00a3250bn social security budget, much of the burden is likely to fall on low-wage workers and their children \u2013 through reductions in tax credits or housing benefit, for example. This comes as his party is pledged to cut inheritance tax for property owners (kids whose parents\u2019 home is worth less than \u00a3650,000 already don\u2019t pay it) and raise the threshold for paying the higher rate of income tax \u2013 two reforms aimed at middle and top earners. Third, more austerity is risky at a time when recovery appears to be fragile against a background of the bubbling eurozone crisis. The argument that sucking demand out of the economy through public spending cuts could jeopardise growth may have been trounced in pre-election debates \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t right. Amartya Sen, the Nobel-prizewinning economist, wrote an elegant essay in the New Statesman last week damning what he called \u201cthe confused anxiety, not to mention the orchestrated fear, that seems to run down the spine of the terrorised British today, making austerity look like a fitting response\u201d. He argues forcefully that a nation\u2019s debts are mainly owed to someone else within the same society \u2013 for example the pension-holders whose funds are stacked full of gilts. Less than a quarter of the UK\u2019s debts are owed to overseas investors and there is little evidence to suggest bondholders want fresh cuts. As Jonathan Portes of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research pointed out last week, there was almost no visible reaction in the gilt market to the Tories\u2019 surprise election victory, which implied a considerably tighter future fiscal policy than most of the polls were predicting. Separately, a report from the International Monetary Fund, rarely considered a hotbed of fiscal recklessness, warned about the risks of trying to tackle a country\u2019s debt burden too quickly. It\u2019s not that the IMF believes hefty debts don\u2019t have bad consequences for economies \u2013 but for countries in what it calls the \u201cgreen zone\u201d (in which it includes the UK), which can borrow cheaply with little danger of being shut out of capital markets, it suggests the best option might be to live with their debts. Paying them down rapidly distorts the economy too much to be worth the risk. Debts should be \u201creduced organically through growth, or opportunistically when less distortionary sources of revenue are available\u201d, the IMF\u2019s researchers argue. Meanwhile, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, previously a cheerleader for Osborne\u2019s cuts, has urged him to smooth the path of public spending to make it less economically damaging. So the cuts are larger than Osborne and his colleagues let on; they may threaten the quality of cherished public services, place an unfair burden on those who can least bear it, exacerbating inequality \u2013 and jeopardise the very economic growth which is ultimately the best way of tackling the deficit. Labour\u2019s proto-leaders are right to try to learn the lessons of the campaign and seize back the language of \u201caspiration\u201d. But they must not abandon the central insight that austerity is not a necessity, but a political choice.",

Shortly before Osborne\u2019s statement, Carl Emmerson, the IFS\u2019s deputy director, warned that achieving the Tories\u2019 planned cuts would be \u201canything but easy\u201d.</p> <p>Rising cost pressures, not least an ageing society, and protections for cherished areas, including the NHS and overseas aid, mean the pain for other departments will be severe. By 2015, if Osborne proceeds as planned, the budgets of \u201cunprotected\u201d departments, including the Home Office and Department for Business, will be more than 30% lower in real terms than when the 2010 coalition came to power.</p> <p>As the Institute for Government\u2019s Julian McCrae spelled out at the same seminar, there are already warning signs that parts of the public services are creaking. He cited a sharp increase in waiting times at hospital accident and emergency departments, and rising violent assaults in prisons as staff numbers are cut, as examples.</p> <p>So far, surveys suggest the public are only reporting modest deteriorations in services as a result of the past five years\u2019 savings. But as the attrition continues, opinion is likely to shift. Certainly Nicola Sturgeon was able to win a significant hearing for her anti-austerity stance during the election campaign, albeit that the details of the SNP\u2019s spending plans didn\u2019t quite support her fiery rhetoric.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Less than 25% of UK debts is owed to overseas investors and there is little evidence that bondholders want fresh cuts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Second, the belt-tightening is likely to be profoundly unfair. Osborne has repeatedly said his cuts plan will involve a \u00a312bn reduction in the welfare bill. Since pensioners are protected, and out-of-work benefits are a relatively small part of the \u00a3250bn social security budget, much of the burden is likely to fall on low-wage workers and their children \u2013 through reductions in tax credits or housing benefit, for example.</p> <p>This comes as his party is pledged to cut inheritance tax for property owners (kids whose parents\u2019 home is worth less than \u00a3650,000 already don\u2019t pay it) and raise the threshold for paying the higher rate of income tax \u2013 two reforms aimed at middle and top earners.</p> <p>Third, more austerity is risky at a time when recovery appears to be fragile against a background of the bubbling eurozone crisis.</p> <p>The argument that sucking demand out of the economy through public spending cuts could jeopardise growth may have been trounced in pre-election debates \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t right. Amartya Sen, the Nobel-prizewinning economist, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/06/amartya-sen-economic-consequences-austerity\" title=\"\">wrote an elegant essay in the <em>New Statesman</em></a> last week damning what he called \u201cthe confused anxiety, not to mention the orchestrated fear, that seems to run down the spine of the terrorised British today, making austerity look like a fitting response\u201d.</p> <p>He argues forcefully that a nation\u2019s debts are mainly owed to someone else within the same society \u2013 for example the pension-holders whose funds are stacked full of gilts.</p> <p>Less than a quarter of the UK\u2019s debts are owed to overseas investors and there is little evidence to suggest bondholders want fresh cuts. As Jonathan Portes of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research <a href=\"http://niesr.ac.uk/blog/government-borrowing-and-long-term-interest-rates-natural-experiment?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter#.VXGmFWTF_5q\" title=\"\">pointed out last week</a>, there was almost no visible reaction in the gilt market to the Tories\u2019 surprise election victory, which implied a considerably tighter future fiscal policy than most of the polls were predicting.</p> <p>Separately, a report from the International Monetary Fund, rarely considered a hotbed of fiscal recklessness, warned about the risks of trying to tackle a country\u2019s debt burden too quickly. It\u2019s not that the IMF believes hefty debts don\u2019t have bad consequences for economies \u2013 but for countries in what it calls the \u201cgreen zone\u201d (in which it includes the UK), which can borrow cheaply with little danger of being shut out of capital markets, it suggests the best option might be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/jun/02/public-debt-why-keep-cutting-why-not-just-live-with-it\" title=\"\">to live with their debts</a>. Paying them down rapidly distorts the economy too much to be worth the risk.</p> <p>Debts should be \u201creduced organically through growth, or opportunistically when less distortionary sources of revenue are available\u201d, the IMF\u2019s researchers argue. Meanwhile, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, previously a cheerleader for Osborne\u2019s cuts, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/03/oecd-to-george-osborne-spread-the-pain-of-public-spending-cuts\" title=\"\">urged him to smooth the path of public spending</a> to make it less economically damaging.</p> <p>So the cuts are larger than Osborne and his colleagues let on; they may threaten the quality of cherished public services, place an unfair burden on those who can least bear it, exacerbating inequality \u2013 and jeopardise the very economic growth which is ultimately the best way of tackling the deficit.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s proto-leaders are right to try to learn the lessons of the campaign and seize back the language of \u201caspiration\u201d. But they must not abandon the central insight that austerity is not a necessity, but a political choice.</p>",
