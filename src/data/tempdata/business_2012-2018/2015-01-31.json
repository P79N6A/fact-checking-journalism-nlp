      "bodyText": "Daffodils do it; babies do it; kittens do it: growing seems like the most natural thing in the world, and over the years we\u2019ve come to understand growth as the normal state for economies, too. Recessions, when GDP temporarily declines, are an aberration, imperilling human progress and interrupting the natural order. And chancellors are keen to trumpet Britain\u2019s success when, as in 2014, our growth rate races ahead of the competition. So when the Green party suggested last week that it might abandon the idea of targeting GDP growth as a public policy aim, it caused a storm of indignation with some commentators fearing that the environmentalist party \u2013 which has been registering support of more than 10% in some recent polls \u2013 would catapult Britain back to the dark ages. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton and the party\u2019s spokeswoman on the economy, is keen to play this down, stressing that any shift to a new way of gauging economic success would have to be gradual. She argues, for example, that a more rounded view of progress might incorporate a measure of how much Britain is depleting or polluting its \u201cnatural capital\u201d \u2013 resources such as rivers, forests and oceans. The independent Natural Capital Committee, chaired by academic Dieter Helm, already produces regular reports for the government on sustainable use of resources. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to say that \u2013 at the very least to begin with \u2013 alongside GDP, we might also begin to have a measure of the depletion of resources,\u201d Lucas says. \u201cOnce people get more used to that, you could imagine bringing in two or three more indicators: health, community cohesion, equality and so on.\u201d She argues that GDP \u2013 which measures all kinds of economic activity, but misses out \u201cbad\u201d factors such as pollution, is \u201ca very, very flawed measure: all it\u2019s measuring is the amount of money revolving around the economy, without ascertaining whether or not it\u2019s being used to good or bad ends. The prior question is, \u2018what are we trying to achieve with our lives?\u2019 \u201cThe Green vision recognises that there are some things that need to grow \u2013 we certainly want to see growth in environmental technologies, for example \u2013 but we\u2019re challenging growth, scrutinising it.\u201d The Greens are far from alone in questioning whether maximising GDP is what a modern economy should be aiming to achieve. In wealthy, industrialised countries, there has long been a nagging feeling that after a certain point, continued economic growth doesn\u2019t do much to improve people\u2019s satisfaction. In fact, a whole field of \u201chappiness economics\u201d has emerged, to try to identify other factors besides GDP that can predict individuals\u2019 wellbeing. Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy appointed a clutch of august experts, including Nobel prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, to a commission on the measurement of economic performance and social progress. Its reports, published in 2009, concluded:\u201cThe time is ripe for our measurement system to shift emphasis from measuring economic production to measuring people\u2019s wellbeing. And measures of wellbeing should be put in a context of sustainability\u201d. In other words, policymakers should take into account how effective economic policies are at improving workers\u2019 and families\u2019 lives, not just whether they generate growth. This argument has been given added piquancy in the US and the UK in recent years, with as economic growth has bounced back after the great recession, but average incomes for ordinary families have in many cases stagnated, or fallen in real terms. Stiglitz wrote in a Guardian article last autumn: \u201cRegardless of how fast GDP grows, an economic system that fails to deliver gains for most of its citizens, and in which a rising share of the population faces increasing insecurity, is, in a fundamental sense, a failed economic system.\u201d Andrew Simms, director of the New Economics Foundation thinktank, says this disconnect between growth and rising living standards has undermined confidence in the growth-at-all-costs approach. \u201cToday,\u201d he says, \u201c50 years on from a debate about the sustainability of infinite growth being raised in part of the burgeoning environmental movement, it\u2019s not the Greens that have killed growth, it\u2019s the market.\u201d Of course, traditional metrics such as real wage growth and the unemployment rate can help to flesh out a bare-bones approach that focuses on output alone, but there\u2019s now a flourishing quasi-industry in dreaming up other indicators. Soon after he came to power in Britain, David Cameron was keen to complete his project of shrugging off the Tories\u2019 \u201cnasty party\u201d image, so asked the Office for National Statistics to put together new measures of national wellbeing, which the government could look at alongside GDP to judge the state of the economy. As well as asking companies how many widgets they produced last week, and finding out how long an unemployed person has been looking for a job, the statisticians now report regularly on the public\u2019s answers to questions such as: \u201cTo what extent do you feel that the things you do in life are worthwhile?\u201d and \u201cHow anxious did you feel yesterday?\u201d They will then track the changes in these measures over time. Not to be outdone, Labour leader Ed Miliband recently announced that he would set up a new living standards index, which would be given equal status with GDP \u2013 though he intends to focus it firmly on such solid things as wage rates, rather than happiness. Simms at the New Economics Foundation points out that that many early economists expected growth to be merely a medium-range target, not an infinite goal. Even Simon Kuznets, who carried out much of the pioneering work in compiling detailed records of US GDP at American\u2019s National Bureau of Economic Research during the 1930s, insisted: \u201cThe welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of national income.\u201d Simms adds: \u201cThere was always this understanding that economies would expand up to a certain point, after which they would mature in other ways.\u201d He argues that aiming at endless growth is simply not environmentally sustainable. \u201cThere\u2019s a straightforward, scientific question: can you do it without pulling the rug from under your own feet?\u201d Lucas insists that politicians must start consciously working towards an economic model that conserves resources, minimises pollution, and improves welfare. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about permanent recession. We\u2019re not talking about pickling everything in aspic. We\u2019re talking about a managed process over time, rather than something that has been forced on us.\u201d However, some economists are nervous about the idea of ditching a tried-and-tested measure of progress \u2013 and they argue that growth actually correlates well with many of the things people are really interested in: not least jobs and incomes. Mark Littlewood, director general of the Institute of Economic Affairs, says, \u201cGDP tends to go with the grain of all the other things we care about in life. People do want, in general terms, to get richer, to acquire more goods. And I say good luck to them.\u201d And, he adds, when it comes to environmental sustainability, economic growth and the ingenuity and technological innovation it tends to encourage are not the problem but the answer. \u201cFor example, London is enormously richer than it was 50 years ago, and its air quality is immeasurably improved. GDP has a hell of a lot going for it.\u201d GDP: WHAT IT IS \u2013 AND WHAT IT IS NOT Gross domestic product is a measure of a country or region\u2019s economic activity. It is compiled in the UK by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and closely watched by policymakers in government and the Bank of England. In particular they focus on the change in GDP from quarter to quarter: if GDP is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing; if it is down, it is contracting. Two or more consecutive quarters of contraction mean a recession, technically speaking. GDP is the sum of all goods and services produced in the economy, including services, manufacturing, construction, energy, agriculture and government. But there are several ways of getting to a GDP figure. The ONS uses three, and they should, at least in theory, all add up to the same number: 1. The value of all goods and services produced - the output measure. 2. The value of goods and services purchased by households, government, business (investment in machinery and buildings) and from overseas - the expenditure measure. 3. The value of the revenue generated from company profits and wages - the income measure. Over time, the scope of what GDP covers has changed. Most recently, the value of sex work and drug dealing was included, to bring UK data into line with EU rules. Regardless of whether such activities are included, the ONS stresses that there are limitations in what GDP can tell us about an economy: It is not a measure of wealth, welfare or wellbeing.

      "bodyText": "Morrisons is planning to close its two salary-linked pension schemes in a move affecting about 8,000 workers at the ailing supermarket chain. Letters consulting staff on the change, which could save Morrisons between \u00a35m and \u00a310m a year, were sent out on Friday, just weeks after rival Tesco announced it would be closing its own defined-benefit scheme. Both businesses are trying to save money to invest in cutting prices and improving service and products, in an attempt to fight off fierce competition from the rapidly growing discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Retailers and other businesses are also cutting retirement benefits for employees as pension costs rise, partly because people are living longer. Even the John Lewis Partnership, which is owned by its employees, is consulting on ditching its final salary pension scheme and is expected to reveal its plans imminently. Morrisons closed its two defined-benefit schemes, one of which caters to former Safeway staff, to new members more than five years ago. The latest move will prevent those already on the two schemes making any further contributions to them. Benefits already built up will be unaffected, but employees will have to move to Morrisons\u2019 \u201ccash balance\u201d scheme, which newer staff have been on for the past three years, for any future accrual. The newer scheme, called the Retirement Saver Plan, is a form of defined-benefit scheme that promises a certain pension pot but does not guarantee the income it will produce in retirement. Emily Lawson, human resources director for Morrisons, said: \u201cThis proposal is intended to provide fairer pensions benefits to all colleagues, ensuring that those doing the same role primarily have access to the same benefits. \u201cThese are only proposals at this stage. Before any final decisions are made we will be entering into a consultation process with affected colleagues and their representatives.\u201d Morrisons\u2019 pension liabilities amount to \u00a3805m according to the latest report and accounts, but the scheme has a surplus of \u00a312m, making it a rarity in being well-funded compared to many schemes which are under water. Joanne McGuinness, national officer at shopworkers\u2019 union Usdaw, said the change would be worrying for its members at Morrisons. She said: \u201cThere is a legal requirement for Morrisons to enter into a meaningful consultation with Usdaw regarding this change to pension provision and we are currently in the process of agreeing a timetable for discussions.\u201d John Ralfe, an independent pensions consultant, said most small and medium-sized companies had already closed their defined-benefit schemes ahead of changes to the tax rules in 2016 which will make the schemes less attractive to employers. \u201cThere will be lots more big companies doing this over the course of the next 18 months,\u201d Ralfe said.",
