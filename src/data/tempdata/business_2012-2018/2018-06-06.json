      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s economy grew faster in the first three months of this year than it has for over six years \u2013 but with growth mainly driven by mining exports and public spending on health and the NDIS, households have largely missed out on the benefits as spending continues to be weak and real incomes continue to fall. First, the good news. In the March quarter, in seasonally adjusted terms, Australia\u2019s economy grew by 1.0%, the fastest quarterly growth since December 2011: This produced a big jump in the annual growth rate \u2013 up from 2.4% in December to 3.1% \u2013 the strongest for nearly two years. It says something that 3.1% used to be the average growth rate, and now it is the best we have seen for some time. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday In trend terms things were a touch less exuberant. Quarterly growth was just 0.7% and was actually slower than in the December quarter, and the annual rate of 2.8% marked the 22nd consecutive quarter where growth was below 3%: The main reason the seasonally adjusted figures were rather shinier than the trend figures was that the biggest drivers of growth in March were exports of LNG and coal. Unlike consumption and investment spending, export growth (and especially net exports, which subtracts the negative impact of imports on economic growth) is rather erratic \u2013 and thus bounces around a bit, in seasonally adjusted terms. In the March quarter, net exports added 0.35% to GDP growth \u2013 a third of the total growth, and yet in the December quarter (due to cyclones that prevented some exports) next exports actually reduced GDP growth: After exports, the big drivers of growth were government spending on health, aged care and the NDIS. Interestingly, despite recent strong spending on public investment projects, in March the growth of public investment slowed somewhat, while still adding to GDP: While household consumption in March contributed 0.2% points to GDP growth, such an amount actually highlights how weak household spending is at the moment. Household consumption makes up around 60% of our economy, and yet it contributed only 20% of the growth in the first three months of this year. Over the past year household consumption grew by just 2.9% \u2013 marking more than six years since it grew by more than 3% in trend terms \u2013 a level that once would have been considered well below-average: And a major reason that spending was even that good was because households are reducing the amount they are saving. In March, Australia households on average saved just 2.1% of their disposable income \u2013 the lowest since 2007. We\u2019re spending as much as we were last year, but we are saving less in order to do so. The reason of course is weak wages growth. And here we see two different pictures \u2013 one that is good for the government and one that is less good for households. While over the past year the total amount of compensation (mostly wages and salaries) going to employees rose 5.1% \u2013 the strongest for six years \u2013 the average compensation per employee rose just 1.6%, the best only since 2014: In the past, around 60% of the rise in total compensation to employees was due to rises in the average rate (i.e. pay rises); now it accounts for only around 30%. Essentially, the total amount is rising because employment growth was so strong over the past year that it outweighed the weak wages growth. That has been good for government income tax revenue \u2013 because that is based on a combination of employment and wage growth. But while that worked well in 2017, the latest figures suggest that the very strong employment growth is coming off the boil: If that continues, then the lack of wages growth will start once again to bite into tax revenue forecasts. And the lack of growth in average wages is not all that surprising given where the growth in the economy and employment is coming from \u2013 mining exports (which don\u2019t require much labour) and the health and aged care sector. Government spending in infrastructure, healthcare and the NDIS has seen government contribution to GDP growth reach levels much more associated with times where the economy needs government stimulus, rather than where the private sector is powering us along: And while the average level of compensation going to employees is growing, the figures only serve to highlight how households are actually going backwards. In the past 12 months average compensation to employees grew by 1.6% while inflation during that time grew by 1.9% - meaning in real terms, employees went backwards. This should be no shock \u2013 the average compensation of employees hasn\u2019t risen in real terms in any meaningful sense for six years: It is why household disposable income per capita, despite rising ever so slightly in March, remains lower now than it was in 2012: So yes, it is good that the economy is growing, but these figures show no real sign of any change from the picture that we have become accustomed to \u2013 economic growth remaining positive but historically weak; and households seeing little of that growth flowing through into improved standards of living. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "Paul Pester, chief executive of TSB, apologised unreservedly, then profusely, then deeply, which showed he\u2019d learned something from his first appearance in the front of the Treasury select committee a month ago. Back then, his priority seemed to be to play down the scale of the IT shambles and boast about how the \u201cunderlying engine\u201d was doing its job. This time, as one MP noted, he seemed determined to set a record for number of apologies to a parliamentary committee. Pester\u2019s problem, though, is that this debacle was never really about saying sorry. It is about competence, and being seen to be on top of the job. On the IT calamity itself, it is impossible for outsiders to tell if TSB or Spanish parent Sabadell, whose kit was being adopted, is more to blame. But under the UK regulatory system the UK boss is the person with ultimate responsibility, so the buck stops at Pester\u2019s door. And he is plainly directly responsible for handing the fallout from the crisis and communicating honestly with customers. On that front, there is no excuse. The Financial Conduct Authority has said the bank\u2019s poor response risks damaging trust in the entire banking sector. That wasn\u2019t quite an invitation from the FCA for heads to roll \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t far off. Pester might still have helped himself by demonstrating that TSB is a model of generosity in compensating customers who have been messed about. Yet John Mann MP was gifted a goal when it turned out that a customer whose wedding had been ruined by the IT shambles had been offered a mere \u00a3100. \u201cPitiful, embarrassing, cringeworthy,\u201d cried Mann. Pester \u2013 or somebody at TSB - should have seen that one coming since Mann had raised the case in last month\u2019s session. It led to an inevitable exchange over the payoffs that will be collected by any executives who are eventually fired. There won\u2019t be payoffs where individuals have been \u201cnegligent or grossly negligent\u201d, said chairman Richard Meddings, choosing his words extremely carefully. Already the next PR disaster comes into view. In the circumstances, the most amazing statistic was that only 12,500 customers have abandoned TSB and switched their accounts. That suggests the bank can still recover from the shambles in the long-term \u2013 but Pester\u2019s position looks medium-term untenable. Persimmon\u2019s pay chief fails the homework Mind you, directors\u2019 inability to prepare for select committees is often staggering. Marion Sears, head of remuneration at Persimmon \u2013 the housebuilder where chief executive Jeff Fairburn bagged a \u00a375m incentive payment \u2013 was asked to tell the business committee the average level of pay at the firm. She didn\u2019t know. Really? On a list of questions that might crop up, that one might be in the top two. MPs sometimes grumble that directors are over-coached for these sessions. If only. Why no UK bank on the RBS ticket? No British bank was used to round up buyers for the government\u2019s sale of 7.7% of Royal Bank of Scotland on Monday night. The crew for the bookrunning job was entirely American: Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley. Don\u2019t weep too hard for Barclays and HSBC, the only two credible British candidates \u2013 they\u2019ll live. But the lineup looks weird. No other large European country would have run a high-profile privatisation without a national bank on the ticket, even if only in a walk-on role. France would have included BNP Paribas or some other. In Germany, it would be amazing if Deutsche Bank, for all its current woes, wasn\u2019t on the ticket. As Brexit approaches, it looks doubly odd. Isn\u2019t the Treasury meant to be flying the flag for UK financial services? And, since the banks were paid only the nominal sum of \u00a31, it would have cost nothing to expand the syndicate.

The company\u2019s difficulties come as a string of retailers and restaurants seek to exit high-street outlets in the face of rising costs and a squeeze on consumer spending. House of Fraser is expected to announce details of a CVA, under which it is likely to close at least 20 of its 60 stores, within days.

      "bodyText": "TSB has admitted that 1,300 customers had money stolen from their accounts \u2013 in some cases their life savings \u2013 by fraudsters exploiting the bank\u2019s recent IT meltdown. The bank\u2019s embattled chief executive, Paul Pester, also disclosed that the number of people quitting the bank in the wake of the botched IT upgrade was running at 400 to 500 a day, and currently totalled 12,500 since the problems first emerged in late April. During often heated exchanges with MPs on the Treasury select committee on Wednesday afternoon, Pester and two other executives, TSB chair Richard Meddings and Miquel Montes, chief operations officer of parent company Sabadell, were lambasted for paying \u201cpitiful, embarrassing, cringeworthy\u201d levels of compensation to victims of the fiasco. They were asked \u201cWhy are you still in your job?\u201d and \u201cCan we be certain that some heads are going to roll?\u201d Nicky Morgan, Conservative MP and chair of the committee, told Pester at the end of the hearing that TSB had \u201cunfortunately earned the epithet \u2018Truly Shambolic Bank\u2019\u201d. Pester apologised repeatedly, prompting one MP to say he had \u201cset a new record for apologies\u201d, but rejected suggestions he should consider stepping aside, saying: \u201cI believe I\u2019m the right person to fix this problem for our customers.\u201d Up to 1.9 million of TSB\u2019s 5.2 million customers began experiencing problems with online and mobile banking services on Monday 23 April after accounts were migrated from an IT system inherited from the previous owner, Lloyds Banking Group, to Spanish parent Sabadell\u2019s technology operation. More than six weeks later, some TSB customers are still facing disruption to services. On Wednesday the bank\u2019s website admitted that some were \u201chaving difficulties and seeing an error message\u201d when making payments, and it stated that some business account holders were \u201cstill having issues\u201d. Pester\u2019s appearance before the committee came shortly after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) launched a stinging attack on the bank\u2019s bosses over their failure to be open and transparent with customers. The bank revealed it had racked up a year-to-date bill of about \u00a370m to cover various costs relating to the problems, which included \u00a311.2m in compensation to customers who had suffered fraud \u2013 a figure likely to reach closer to \u00a320m once amounts not yet paid were included. During the hearing the FCA\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Bailey, said there had been about 10,600 fraud \u201cincidents\u201d relating to the IT meltdown. However, Pester said that the number who had lost money from their accounts to fraudsters was 1,300. These people had now been refunded, he added. The chief executive said he was shocked to read reports of customers who had waited on the phone for up to nine hours to disclose incidents of fraud. In some cases their life savings had been taken from them. However, Pester said 70 times the normal level of fraud attacks were seen last month, and he described this as \u201can unprecedented attack across UK banking from organised crime\u201d, adding that TSB was working with a range of agencies in an attempt to track down the perpetrators. Morgan gave details of a self-employed businessman, Paul Catherall, who had \u00a324,550 stolen from his account last month. The bank later made a payment into his account of the same sum, but had offered only \u00a3192 compensation, of which \u00a342 was for the cost of phone calls made by Catherall. Morgan said: \u201cI don\u2019t think \u00a3192 is nearly sufficient.\u201d She added that some people\u2019s major life experiences such as weddings and house purchases had been ruined by what had happened. The bank also disclosed that it had cancelled overdraft fees and charges totalling \u00a329m in the wake of the problems. The committee also heard that 370 former customers had been affected by a blunder which meant people switching away from TSB to another bank found that regular payments had been cancelled because companies were told that they had died. Pester said a software error was behind the problem, and people were being contacted and offered compensation. One MP, Labour\u2019s John Mann, asked: \u201cHow many heads are going to roll?\u201d Meddings said the board had hired City law firm Slaughter &amp; May to lead an independent review into the meltdown, which was going to be thorough. He added: \u201cIf I\u2019m found to be culpable, then the actions will attach to me.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Ihop becomes Ihob in desperate blea for attention", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Well, we\u2019re talking about them, so it worked. On Monday, in what would appear to be a desperate plea for attention, the International House of Pancakes announced that it is changing its name from Ihop to Ihob. The internet, predictably, flipped. But what does that \u201cb\u201d stand for you might ask? Breakfast? Bancake? Blockchain? Be Best? I\u2019m afraid you will have to wait to find out. The restaurant chain tweeted that it will announce the big news on 11 June, if you can handle the anticipation. Ihop has generously, thrown us a few hints while they count down the days to the big reveal. \u201cWe\u2019re serious about the quality of food and our menu, and this name change really reflects that,\u201d Stephanie Peterson, Ihop\u2019s executive director of communications said in a statement that really reflects the world vapid PR communications. A name change is an expensive and often risky endeavour. A study by Millward Brown, a research company, found that many brands that change their names experience an immediate 5 to 20% drop in sales, and a weakened brand image. Brands typically only change their name when they\u2019re forced to or when they\u2019re desperate for attention. In 2014, for example, a Belgian chocolate maker called Isis changed its name for obvious reasons. \u201cHad we known there was a terrorist organization with the same name, we would have never chosen that,\u201d a marketing manager from the company told Reuters. Sometimes a name change makes sense strategically, as a way of reflecting a brand\u2019s changing place in society. In the UK, for example, Heinz has recently upset condiment purists by stating it may change the name of its Salad Cream to Sandwich Cream. Which, you know, doesn\u2019t sound disgusting at all. The potential change comes after research by Heinz showed that only 14% of the condiment\u2019s consumers use it on salad. It\u2019s name no longer \u201cfairly represents the product\u2019s ingredients or usage occasions\u201d. In Ihop\u2019s case, however, it seems that the name change is probably neither terrorism-related nor usage-occasion-related. Rather, it seems likely that \u201cIhob\u201d is just a stunt designed to publicize the introduction of some fascinating new item on the Ihop menu. The pancake purveyor appears to have taken a slice out Pizza Hut\u2019s marketing book. In 2008 the international chain \u201crebranded\u201d to Pasta Hut in an April Fool\u2019s day stunt designed to draw attention to new pasta dishes on its menu. The fast food chain\u2019s marketing director described the move as a \u201ca bit of a shock tactic\u201d which was supposed to \u201cget people to feel differently about Pizza Hut\u201d. People were suitably shocked if not exactly awed. Shortly after this underwhelming stunt, Pizza Hut decided it was going to rebrand to \u201cThe Hut\u201d in order to be down with the texting kids. This was promptly ridiculed and the company had to put out a press release saying: \u201cWe are proud of our name and heritage and will continue to be Pizza Hut.\u201d It\u2019s not just Pizza Hut \u2013 plenty of other brands have tweaked their names for advertising purposes. In 2016, for example, Budweiser temporarily changed its name to America to capitalize on major US events taking place that year, including Copa America Centenario being held on US soil for the first time, Team USA competing at the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games and an election that left many people feeling like they needed a drink. Marks &amp; Spencer, a British retailer, recently celebrated the royal wedding by temporarily changing its name to Markle &amp; Sparkle, although they discovered they weren\u2019t the only ones to come up with that formulation. Meghan Markle\u2019s nephew, licensed Oregon marijuana farmer Tyler Dooley, released a marijuana strain called Markle &amp; Sparkle in observance of the happy event.",

      "body": "<p>Well, we\u2019re talking about them, so it worked.</p> <p>On Monday, in what would appear to be a desperate plea for attention, the International House of Pancakes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IHOP/status/1003682801042915328\">announced</a> that it is changing its name from Ihop to Ihob. The internet, predictably, flipped.</p> <p>But what does that \u201cb\u201d stand for you might ask? Breakfast? Bancake?

A study by Millward Brown, a research company, found that many brands that change their names experience an immediate 5 to 20% drop in sales, and a weakened brand image. Brands typically only change their name when they\u2019re forced to or when they\u2019re desperate for attention. In 2014, for example, a Belgian chocolate maker called Isis changed its name for obvious reasons. \u201cHad we known there was a terrorist organization with the same name, we would have never chosen that,\u201d a marketing manager from the company told Reuters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jun/06/from-pizza-dip-to-carbonara-nine-unexpected-ways-to-eat-salad-cream\">From pizza dip to carbonara: nine unexpected ways to eat salad cream</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sometimes a name change makes sense strategically, as a way of reflecting a brand\u2019s changing place in society. In the UK, for example, Heinz has recently upset condiment purists by stating it may change the name of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jun/06/from-pizza-dip-to-carbonara-nine-unexpected-ways-to-eat-salad-cream\">Salad Cream to Sandwich Cream</a>. Which, you know, doesn\u2019t sound disgusting at all. The potential change comes after research by Heinz showed that only 14% of the condiment\u2019s consumers use it on salad. It\u2019s name no longer \u201cfairly represents the product\u2019s ingredients or usage occasions\u201d. </p> <p>In Ihop\u2019s case, however, it seems that the name change is probably neither terrorism-related nor usage-occasion-related. Rather, it seems likely that \u201cIhob\u201d is just a stunt designed to publicize the introduction of some fascinating new item on the Ihop menu. The pancake purveyor appears to have taken a slice out Pizza Hut\u2019s marketing book. In 2008 the international chain \u201crebranded\u201d to Pasta Hut in an April Fool\u2019s day stunt designed to draw attention to new pasta dishes on its menu. The fast food chain\u2019s marketing director <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/pizza-hut-rebrands-pasta-hut/851119\">described the move</a> as a \u201ca bit of a shock tactic\u201d which was supposed to \u201cget people to feel differently about Pizza Hut\u201d. People were suitably shocked if not exactly awed. Shortly after this underwhelming stunt, Pizza Hut decided it was going to rebrand to \u201cThe Hut\u201d in order to be down with the texting kids. <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pizza-hut-plan-to-change-name-to-the-hut-meets-with-ridicule/\">This was promptly ridiculed</a> and the company had to put out a press release saying: \u201cWe are proud of our name and heritage and will continue to be Pizza Hut.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f35f0c7c81dd3708f42f42379976c559e2bb3178\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f35f0c7c81dd3708f42f42379976c559e2bb3178/0_10_750_450/500.jpg\" alt=\"Budweiser America can\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Budweiser America can</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Budweiser</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not just Pizza Hut \u2013 plenty of other brands have tweaked their names for advertising purposes. In 2016, for example, Budweiser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/10/budweiser-rebrands-america-us-election\">temporarily changed its name to America</a> to capitalize on major US events taking place that year, including Copa America Centenario being held on US soil for the first time, Team USA competing at the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games and an election that left many people feeling like they needed a drink. </p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer, a British retailer, recently celebrated the royal wedding by temporarily changing its name to Markle &amp; Sparkle, although they discovered they weren\u2019t the only ones to come up with that formulation.

    "webTitle": "TSB says 1,300 people lost money through fraud since IT meltdown - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "TSB bosses faced another bruising session in front of the Treasury select committee as they were quizzed about the continuing IT meltdown which hit 1.9m of its customers. Chief executive Paul Pester said 2,200 customers had suffered fraudulent attempts to access their accounts since the IT problems first surfaced. Of these 1,300 had received compensation. Earlier FCA boss Andrew Bailey mentioned a figure of 10,600 incidents, but Pester clarified that the figure referred to alerts sent to accounts when suspicious activity was detected by the bank\u2019s systems. Pester said the bank had set up a dedicated fraud line to deal with the overwhelming number of enquiries, and waiting times were only a few minutes. But committee chair Nicky Morgan said she had received reports during the meeting of people holding on for nearly 30 minutes before hanging up. MP John Mann expressed amazement when Pester and TSB chair Richard Meddings professed ignorance of a case when someone had received a letter giving details of someone else\u2019s bank account. He also slammed the level of compensation - \u00a3100 - awarded to a constituent for their ruined wedding. With Pester profusely apologising several times during the course of the meeting, Mann said the level of compensation amounted to \u201c\u00a31 per apology\u201d. Morgan described the level of compensation as \u201cabsolutely inadequate.\u201d Overall Pester said the bank had spent \u00a370m on compensation and additional resources to cope with fixing the problems so far. He was also forced to deny he had deliberately misled the committee at its previous hearing. Mann asks if heads will roll, but Meddings says that will depend on the outcome of an investigation by Slaughter and May into the causes of the fiasco. Pester says he will not fall on his sword since he wants to fix the problems, while on the thorny question of possible golden parachutes, Meddings says if people are found to be grossly negligent that will be taken into account in the terms of their departure. The meeting ended with Nicky Morgan saying she expected the TSB executives to be called back again to update the committee on the progress in fixing the problems. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In her closing remarks Morgan says unfortunately the saga goes on. The FCA letter says ... TSB has not been open and transparent. The committee cannot remember such a letter from the FCA. She says, you have confirmed the IT migration has lead to people being fraudulently deprive of their money, life experiences such as weddings and house purchases ruined, the compensation is absolutely inadequate and the problems continue. This cannot be something you want, ultimately it is not only damaging to TSB but also to other banks in the sector and to online banking. Unfortunately, although we are grateful to you for your time... it did take an hour and half for you to thank your staff. I suspect we will ask you to come back again, because we will be keeping a very close eye on what is going on to put all of this right. Question: will it look at culpability of individuals and the role of the Spanish bank? Meddings says it will look at the relationship with the platform supplier. Question: what is the scope of the instructions to Slaughter and May? Medding says we can provide the terms of reference. The reason it\u2019s a law firm is that part of the terms is about the governance around the decision made to migrate. Question: how many people have switched to TSB? Pester says we have not been attracting many new customers to our current accounts. Morgan asks how much overtime are staff having to do in branches? Pester says he can\u2019t give figures. Branch transactions are taking longer than we would like. Branches are not operating normally. Morgan says some of the fraud is done with sim cards so is TSB in contact with the mobile companies? Pester says yes they have been. Morgan says there are people trying to call the fraud line and have waited 15 minutes and 27 minutes and given up. She asks when the Slaughter and May report will be published. Meddings says there is no date but they have started work. He says he hopes it\u2019s several weeks, not longer than that. But not before the summer holidays. They haven\u2019t given me a deadline date. Montes is asked if Sabadell should be paid by TSB for this failure? He says, we are quite conscious about the damage to TSB customers. We know most of it came from bad functioning of the system after migration. We have committed resources to work to a solution. There have not been any kind of discussions about payments,. There won\u2019t be until the solution is finished. Question: who was really in charge here during this process? Pester: The responsibility and decision was with the TSB board. Question: Was the timing, decision making, risk management controlled by TSB? Pester: Ultimately yes although we used a range of suppliers to opine whether we were in a position to migrate. Question: clerks here found a forum with customers complaining of receiving letters for other people. Why are you not prepared to make sure your customers are not being defrauded? Pester says he has acknowledged TSB has sent multiple letters in the same envelope. Again he apologises. Question: how many customers have left the bank? Pester: 12,500 customers have switched away, but I do not know causes. Question: how many staff have you recruited? Pester: 2,200 Question: are you paying them full overtime? Pester: yes, we are paying twice normal rate for overtime. Question: so why weren\u2019t they adequately resourced in the first place? Pester: we did increase resource before migration, but we didn\u2019t expect this level of problems. We would never have done the migration if we had known we would have these issues. Question: Payments to Sabadell for migration were delayed until completion. Why? Pester: To account for any cost overruns. Question: will the payments be made? Pester: it will depend on the report into what happened. On compensation, Pester says if people are not happy they can come back to us. He says it is easy to register a complaint. But Pester is accused of not taking on board how serious some of these problems (eg the ruined wedding) are. Question: can you give a guarantee on a minimum amount? Pester says he will write to the committee with the figures. Pester is asked about TSB\u2019s profits which he says are around \u00a3200m. He says money should not be an object for resources. Question: and should not be an object for compensation? Pester says of course not. Question: how much have you employed for resources and compensation? Pester says we have no set amount. Meddings says we will set an appropriate compensation framework. To date bank has cancelled charges worth \u00a329m. Have compensated people for fraud of \u00a311.2m, and backlog means it is probably \u00a320m year to date. Incremental resources, overtime and people, IBM etc, about another \u00a320m. Montes says the figures are consolidated into Sabadell accounts. Question. You have dealt with 24,094 complaints out of 95,063. This is not a significant number. Should you be adding more resources to address this problem? Pester says we have added 466 extra complaints handlers, over the last week. We dealt with the 24,000 before this, our aspiration is to close this down as quickly as possible. Every complaint we attempt to deal with within eight weeks of receiving it. Question: are you prepared to put in extra staff? Meddings says absolutely yes. We are adding resource as fast as it is possible to do. We have taken more people into branches and call centres, they have to be trained so we are bringing on resources and will continue to do so. Question: the compensation figures are extraordinarily small. Will anyone who is forced out get golden parachutes? Meddings says we will look at conclusions, take necessary action. It will depend on outcome and nature of the fault. If they are found to have been grossly negligent that will be taken into account in the terms of their departure. Question about the letters written by TSB to direct debit companies when customers wanted to switch, saying customers had died. Pester says there were 370 people affected and caused by an error in the software. Pester says they are speaking to the customers\u2019 new banks to contact customers and offer them compensation. Pester says they are correcting the error with the direct debit companies. Morgan says you talk about things being resolved but they may not be resolved to the satisfaction of the customers. Mann says you are in breach of data protection law, you are paying pitiful levels of compensation which I find deeply disturbing, you pay yourselves massive amounts of money. Can we be certain some heads are going to roll? Meddings says it would be wrong to prejudge. But depending on what investigation we will take action. Mann asks them - especially Pester - if they will fall on their swords before they are pushed. Pester says his focus is on fixing this for customers, I am passionate about TSB, I don\u2019t think anyone else will be as committed as me, when we get to end of this procedure we will see. Mann says where is the leadership? Meddings says senior seats carry responsibility and we have chosen these seats. It\u2019s important to establish what went wrong and where there is culpability we will act on it. Mann asks how many heads will roll? Meddings says it is important not to prejudge. Slaughter and May are conducting an independent review, we will publish it and take action on the basis of its findings. If I am found to be culpable then the actions will attach to me. John Mann asks how could one of his constituents receive someone else\u2019s details. Pester says he apologies. I don\u2019t know how it happened, I don\u2019t know the circumstances. It\u2019s not something we do intentionally. Mann asks Meddings the same question. Meddings says I can\u2019t answer without knowing details. Mann asks if this an ongong problem. Pester said he is not aware of it. Mann says his constituent wrote to TSB and heard nothing back. You\u2019re saying you\u2019re not aware and that\u2019s astonishing. I\u2019m struggling that you\u2019re even aware of the problem. Mann asks about a constituent whose wedding was ruined and how much she received. Meddings says she has been compensated but can\u2019t say how much. But it would compensate for distress. Mann says it\u2019s \u00a3100. [Silence] Medding says he apologises. Mann says its \u00a31 per apology in this session. Mann now asks why Sabadell chief operating officer Miguel Montes is still in his job. Montes also apologies, and admits not all problems have been solved. Mann asks how embarrassed is he that his bank\u2019s reputation has been sullied by people who don\u2019t know how people received other people\u2019s details. Montes says, we are very embarrassed. Mann: How embarrassed are you about the level of compensation for someone who\u2019s wedding has been ruined? Montes: I have no competence to answer this question. Mann: Do you have confidence in working with people who don\u2019t bother compensating someone when it\u2019s raised in parliamentary committee. Is that good for your brand reputation. Montes: our brand reputation has been damaged. We have worked night and day, we have progress but not enough. Paul and his team have been clear we will do whatever it takes to compensate customers. Mann says Meddings reputation is on the line as well. How long will this take? Meddings says, we are working vigilantly. We are digging ourselves out of a hole. We have challenges with the call lines, and occasionally in the branches. Mann says the branches are bailing you out, and you have put the call centre staff in a difficult situation. Meddings thanks the bank\u2019s staff for having to deal with the situation. Question: The FCA has never written such a letter. Do you accept you should take more personal responsibility. Pester says, I am taking complete and utter responsibility.. All I can do is focus on fixing the situation. Question: Many on the committee believe you have misled the committee. Pesters says, I\u2019m sorry if you feel that, I have given the best information I had. Morgan says in a letter on 25 April you wrote everything it running smoothly for vast majority of customers. FCA said this was an example of poor communication. Do you regret that phrase? Pester apologies if he misled anyone. The use of that phrase was to show credit card, debit payments [etc] key parts were working well but we had serious problems with customer access. He says we have tried to communicate as well as we can. Question about whether Pester made confusing statement about IBM\u2019s role. Are IBM doing a full review or are they there just to help the situation? Pestere says they are there to help us fix problems, then perform a review to help us understand how this could have occurred. I apologise for my loose use of wording. Question: this is not the only loose use of wording. You said it was middlewear but it was more than this and you seem to know this from the IBM slides. Pester said the IBM findings are early findings and observations and say most of the problems are related to the applications, middleware and network ather than the underlying infrastructure. I tried to explain this in the first session. [Pester is asked to hand over the slides and does so.] Question: The FCA reminded TSB that communications should be fair and not misleading. Do you accept you misled customers and the committee. Pester says he does not accept he misled committee. The FCA did ask TSB to change and improve communications on 25 April. We did that a day later, and then the FCA said our communications were excellent. Question: Bailey wrote on 30 May and said the TSB\u2019s use of figures risked giving too positive a view. Do you accept he feels you have not been frank? Pester says Bailey also said there is no reason to believe TSB has made misleading statements and I apologise if you think. Question: This is your MO, you\u2019re saying its not that bad. This infuriates everyone, people feel they are being misled. Pester says this is not my intent. I\u2019m apologetic if you feel I\u2019m trying to spin the information. Question: Bailey says your quoting of averages is misleading. Pester says he\u2019s sorry if he appears to be unhelpful but he is telling the facts as he sees them. Question: In how many cases since the migration, when there has been an investi of the customer being liable, has there been a delay in compensation. Pester says we said we are not challenging or investigating customers as we created the uncertainty. To the best of my knowledge the answer is zero. MPs are giving more examples of customers suffering problems. Pester apologises if he gave the impression he was downplaying the seriousness of the problems facing the bank. He also says he is sorry if the committee thinks he is not keeping his customers up to date. Question: Either you knew about the scale of the issues with the fraud line [at the time of the previous committee session] and you didn\u2019t tell us or you didn\u2019t know there was a serious problem with fraud line. Pester says I told you the information I had at the time. Question: Banks should refund by the end of the following day when there is fraud. Has TSB done that? Pester admits TSB has not done that. Morgan talks about a self employed printer who wanted to access his money. He talks to TSB, gets another call from a mobile, is advised to talk to the person on the mobile. Then he thinks he\u2019s been defrauded, finds \u00a324,550 been taken from his account and TSB say he does not know how long it will be to get his money back. He has problems contacting TSB, finally gets his money back, changes account. Then he gets a letter, saying TSB is not at fault, and it offered \u00a3192. Is that a fair outcome. Pester says the details are distressing and I apologise. We will of course look at this case, and address them. He was caught up in that attack, I would like to take his case further. Chairman Richard Meddings also apologies, says its difficult to comment on whether the payments are sufficient. They don\u2019t necessarily seem to be a correct calculation, but we are attempting to set a framework of compensations taking into account stress and consequential loss. Morgan says the more important point, and where TSB is tone deaf, where the letter suggests customer has to prove the point. Meddings says, I get your point. When fraudsters raid accounts, banks can says customers are negligent but we are trying to compensate in full without asking about liability. Morgan says during last hearing, the TSB twitter account said fraud lines were experiencing higher than usual levels. If twitter knew that why didn\u2019t you? Pester apologies (again!) and says the number he gave in good faith was the number he had at the time. Morgan says does TSB deserve nickname of Terribly Shambolic Bank? Pester says this whole situation has been a terrible situation for TSB customers. All I can do is work hard to fix this situation. Morgan says Pester had said in a letter yesterday that between 23 April to 31 May, some 2,200 TSB customers had experienced attempts to access their accounts and 1300 suffered financial loss. But the FCA mentioned 10,000 incidents. For some customers this is not happening once but several times. Isn\u2019t it typical that every time TSB is asked, you try to be clever with the numbers. Pester says he\u2019s sorry if that seems to be the case. The FCA number refers to alerts on accounts, pointing out unusual transaction patterns, which trigger text messages to see if they are genuine. If we don\u2019t hear we block the accounts until we are able to speak to the customer. The 2,200 number is number of customers who had attempts to defraud. Morgan says how many fraud incidents where people had money taken out of their accounts were there? Pester says 1300 had money taken out of their account by fraudsters, and we have refunded them. Morgan points out Pester said at the last hearing that people were waiting only three minutes on the fraud line. Pester says at the last meeting we had not been subject to fraud attacks at that level, it started on the first bank holiday in May, peaked on 15 May, then came under control since. At first meeting we were not subject to those levels of attack. That was the true statement of the situation at the time. I am sorry if I appear to have been unforthright in evidence. Pester says the system tracking fraud still blocks accounts if it detects unusual patterns etc, so there are other ways than just customer reporting fraud. Morgan says fraud system hasn\u2019t been working properly though. Pester says the volume of attacks were 70 times the normal level of attacks. That overwhelmed TSB. So we put in a dedicated line. Fraud is a terrible experience. That fraud line has a two to three minute wait time. I apologise profusely to those customers who have suffered fraud. Pester says it is still the same team, but we recruited more partners so we could respond more quickly. Morgan asks how long people have waited over recent weeks. Pester says it is a priority line so it is a matter of minutes. We have tightened up our fraud defences, and now volume is two or three times normal level. Morgan says people are talking about waiting for hours. Pester says that was before the new line. He apologises again and says it was unacceptable. The level of fraud was unprecedented. But Morgan says in your planning you anticipated an increase in fraudulent activity, so it wasn\u2019t unprecedented. Pester says sadly yes, we had our teams on high intensity when we migrated but it was higher than expected. I have been shocked to read of customers waiting five, seven, nine hours. When I saw that I said we had to fix this. Putting a new line in was very important. Now TSB are up and Nicky Morgan begins with the issue of fraud. Question: Have conditions create a spate of fraudulent activity? Pester says he regrets but the situation gave an opportunity for fraudsters to target customers. Morgan says they have to phone a dedicated fraud line, and is the route to get compensation. Pester agrees but they says customers can report fraud to branches or online, but there is a dedicated line. Ultimately though it all ends up with fraud team. The FCA session ends on that note. John Mann ask who should be held to account? Bailey says that\u2019s the purpose of the investigation. But at the moment the most important thing is to dig out of hole. Mann says will you use the full range of your powers? Bailey says we will use the powers. Question: The last IT meltdown was Co-op. How many other banks are at similar risks with antiquated IT systems? Bailey says there are major IT changes going on most weekends in the banking systems. This year in particular there has been ringfencing. In this case it was a complete replatforming, from the Lloyds sytems to a new one. Most institutions are operating on systems which have evolved over years. [In terms of risk for other banks] Bailey says he hopes not but you never know. There is a lot still to learn about this one, he says. What would it take for us to observe this in a way TSB management did not, what level of intrusion would be needed? We were involved in the Visa incident, that was a hardware failure. We seek to learn but can\u2019t give an assurance these things will never happen again. Question: Will you set out what minimum compensation should be? Bailey says we will want to see how they set it up and calibrate it. There should be a minimum standard below which compensation applies. Services have not been affected evenly, this is one of the problems. Bailey is told the FCA should set down the law otherwise people will not have confidence, especially given the problems small businesses have faced with banks, especially GRG. Bailey says he hopes they appreciate how much the FCA has been involved with TSB. He says the FCA put a team on site very quickly. Question: TSB have appointed Deloitte to look at compensation, how is it going? Bailey says we are pleased they have brought in outside resources, they have been overwhelmed. They are taking it seriously but we want to see it up and running. Howard says they are recruiting staff to deal with compensation. They have started to resolve and settle complaints. Bailey says this should happen quite quickly, it is not very complex. The timeline is short in terms of when things went wrong. Question: In some cases when customers asked to switch, bank has written to some of their direct debit accounts saying they had died, are you aware of this? Bailey says that is another example of putting in a fix in to solve a problem and another part sends out a letter. Don\u2019t think they did that intentionally. Question: Does it undermine the system if people see this happening and are reluctant to switch. Bailey says longer term we will have to see the level of switching and if it is happening effectively. Question: are you confident no other banks do this? Bailey says I think we would know that. Sutherland says it\u2019s a TSB issue. Question: Who controlled the timing of migration of IT systems {TSB or parent company?] Bailey says that will be a major part of the investigation. It was utilising [parent company] Sabadell\u2019s platform but the responsibility rests with TSB managment... But this can\u2019t descend into finger pointing [between TSB and Sabadell] On the question of accountability, Bailey says in this case there is a relationship with an outsourcer (in this case part of the parent company). You can\u2019t outsource responsibility, and it rests with the management of the TSB. Question: have TSB now got it right? Bailey says they have improved considerably. The days of the rather generalised and rosy statements, we haven\u2019t seen them so often. But it is still important, there are a lot of things going wrong in branches, quite basis and important things. These things still need fixing and it will take time. Question: were your expectations on communications reflected in Pester\u2019s testimony. Bailey says it should have been a more thorough and balances communications situation. My bias would be tell it as it is and communicate extensively. Question: have you ever issued a letter quite like this before, including saying Pester was too optimistic and statements to the public were poor? Bailey says we don\u2019t have these situations too often. Some parts of the bank\u2019s service are functioning, and it\u2019s fair enough to point that out but there is a danger of overemphasis of that which gets away from the fact there are parts that are troubled. Sutherland says they have a torrid time with the branch systems, leading to very busy branches. It\u2019s quite clear those systems problems still exist. It\u2019s the bits that are not working we are not hearing so much about. Here\u2019s what FCA chief Andrew Bailey told MPs about the fraud attempts on TSB customers (at 2.40pm) I\u201dm going to be a little bit circumspect about what we say about fraud\u2026as we don\u2019t want to give information that fraudsters could use against the firm. We think there\u2019s been just over 10,000, 10,600, incidents, and that has resulted in a level of payout. FCA special advisor John Sutherland then explained how the number of \u2018alerts\u2019 of possible fraud are still rising. These alerts lead to customer accounts being blocked or stopped while the situation is investigated - but TSB is struggling to cope. Sutherland said: \u201cTSB is resourcing up to clear those alerts as soon as they can, but they are still on an upward trend. That doesn\u2019t indicate so much that there is an increasing amount of fraud, it\u2019s just that they not resourcing themselves yet to clear them fast enough. Sutherland then talked about the \u201chuge variability\u201d in TSB\u2019s ability to handle calls from customers who may have been defrauded, with just one in 10 getting through at the busiest times. Clearly that\u2019s not acceptable. Question: Do you feel TSB has adhered to the requirements on communcating the situation. Bailey says we have had some frank conversations about communications, and we said in our letter we were not satisfied. There is an onus of overcommunication, to tell customers what is happening. There is uncertainty at the start about what the situation is. Looking at the daily service levels, they were very volatile. Looking at averages doesn\u2019t give the entire picture. There should have been more communication and it needed to be more reflective of the fact it was a volatile and uncertain situation. Its not easy to communicate volatile. But otherwise you see a lot of criticism from customers. A more straightforward recognition of what the situation was would have been helpful. Has TSB always co-operated? Bailey says yes, they are working very hard, I do not want to call into question their hard work. They are in a hole and they are trying to get out of it. That is not the issue. The issue is how did you get in and how do you get out of it and protect the interests of customers. Bailey is asked about the suggestion that TSB chief executive Paul Pester had some information including slides from IBM which he did not share with the previous hearing. Bailey says IBM were brought in on the Wednesday, by the following Sunday they had produced slides of the issues. We saw those on Sunday, the hearing followed on Wednesday. They are not definitive but they do point to things. At the hearings, Pester said IBM believe issues are in the middleware. But it appears to be not just in the middleware, which the IBM slides show. Question: where are we in timeline for having a coherent plan for the recovery of services? Sutherland says there is a rolling fortnight forward plan for fixing faults in IT, but we haven\u2019t seen a plan for getting back to where we were before migration. Bailey says one of the reasons they brought IBM in was they didn\u2019t have that plan, IBM are helping put that plan in. Question: does TSB understand the problems, and have the root causes been found? Bailey says the understanding of the problem has evolved over time. It is still evolving, I do not regard that as particularly negligent. The rate of emerging faults is falling off, as you would expect. It would be wrong to speculate [about our investigation] but testing will be one of the key questions. How robust and rigorous was it. They have put a fix in, and something else happens elsewhere in the architecture, and messages are sent to customers which shouldn\u2019t be. So that gets back to testing. Question: when was FCA first told about the TSB problems? Bailey says the first warning that the FCA got was on the Sunday evening, we were notified at one minute to nine o\u2019clock. They were going live at 6 o\u2019clock, they first identified problems at 6.20. We heard just before 9,. we had the first call just around midnight. The FCA response was activated the next day. Morgan says FCA says they had not met standard for repaying fraud, why was that? Bailey says they were initially overwhelmed. The FCA\u2019s Sheree Howard says, they have now prioritised that. Morgan says is there a pattern of TSB trying to argue the case before refunding. The FCA says no. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, says one in ten fraud-related calls being answered is not up to FCA standards, and the FCA agrees. TSB set up a dedicated fraud line, with the idea that customers would be able to get through more quickly. People can use either line. Sutherland said the fraud problem didn\u2019t come up in the first ten days. Bailey is asked about fraud but says he will be circumspect. He says there have been around 10,600 incidents, which have resulted in a level of payout. The FSA\u2019s John Sutherland is talking about TSB being alerted to the prospect of fraud, which could lead to customers\u2019 accounts been locked. These are still on an upward trend, as TSB is not resourcing themselves. There is a huge variability between one in ten calls answered to practically all, depending on time of time. This has led to customers complaining about how long they have been waiting. The TSB session has begun, with the Financial Conduct Authority underway. Chief executive Andrew Bailey says they have had a full time presence at TSB for some time but they have scaled that back a little now. A reminder. The parliamentary session on the TSB problems can be seen live here, due to start in less than ten minutes. First up is the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s chief executive Andrew Bailey and two of his colleagues. The FCA has issued a strong criticism of the performance of TSB and its chief executive Paul Pester over the IT fiasco. Meanwhile Pester and his team will be quizzed separately once the Treasury Committee is finished with the FCA. TSB\u2019s troubles shine a spotlight on the problems facing much of the banking sector, says professor Pinar Ozcan of Warwick Business School, that is, outdated technology: Many established banks\u2019 complicated and siloed IT infrastructures, which were built in the 1970s, make it difficult for them to form a platform that would make sense of the data that is currently stored in a disorganised and non-standard way in separate databases. Banks typically have vertically integrated pillars, which are all for different products and which don\u2019t really talk to one another. That\u2019s why, when you call your bank for something, they sometimes tell you, we\u2019ve got great rates for a mortgage, and you say, \u2018but I actually have a mortgage with you\u2019! The recent troubles at TSB provide a great example of a nightmare scenario that can arise as banks update their legacy IT systems. And this is a chicken and egg problem in that in order to avoid security breaches like in the case of TSB, banks have been avoiding major overhauls of their systems, but of course, the more they stay in avoidance mode, the less they will be able to provide digital platforms that make sense of data and offer competitive services. The parliamentary session on TSB\u2019s IT problems kicks off off in 30 minutes, so here\u2019s a quick reminder/preamble. The Treasury committee is holding its second hearing into the TSB IT meltdown. MPs will demand answers about the problems that prevented millions of TSB customers from accessing their accounts in recent weeks - and which still aren\u2019t fully fixed. MPs will hear from CEO Paul Pester at 3.30pm. Pester has been accused of complacency last month for not grasping the full extent of the disruption. The Financial Conduct Authority has put more pressure on Pester. The FCA has told MPs suggesting that he was too optimistic about the situation and didn\u2019t give MPs a proper account four weeks ago. The FCA\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Bailey, will give his assessment of the situation at 2.30pm Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan has said she\u2019s very concerned about the communication failures at TSB. Labour shadow City minister Jonathan Reynolds has accused the bank of serious failings. Some TSB customers continue to report problems accessing services, and some are struggling to getting through to the bank to report problems..... After widespread condemnation, the boss of Qatar Airways has apologised for saying only a man could do his job because it\u2019s such a tricky job. Akbar Al Baker has now backtracked, claiming he is committed to gender equality and blaming the media for \u2018sensationalising\u2019 his comments. Frankly I\u2019m not sure they needed sensationalising. If you missed the story, Al Baker declared that: \u201cOf course, it [Qatar Airways] has to be led by a man, because it is a very challenging position.\u201d More here. Peter Praet has also hit eurozone bonds. Bond prices are down, sending yields (interest rates up), following Praet\u2019s hint that the European Central Bank could decide to stop its asset-purchase programme soon. Praet\u2019s comments suggest the ECB isn\u2019t panicking about the new populist government in Italy. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: Everyone in Europe seems to be in a terrific rush at the moment. Italian political developments continue at a rapid pace as the new Government flexes muscles and outlines it strategy. The ECB, widely assumed to be in ait-and-see mode, reluctant to rush towards policy normalisation until the BTP [Italian bond] market, at least, calms down, is also in too much of a hurry for such niceties. Back in the markets, the euro is rallying after a senior policymaker hinted that the European Central Bank could wind down its bond-buying stimulus programme soon. ECB chief economist Peter Praet told a conference in Berlin this morning that the governing council will debate whether to gradually unwind bond purchases at its meeting next week. Praet cited the (long-awaited) recovery in Europe\u2019s labour market; the Eurozone unemployment rate fell to 8.5 percent in April, a 10-year low. That should push inflationary pressures higher, and give the ECB confidence to rein in its money-printing scheme. The ECB\u2019s is currently committed to buying \u20ac30bn of eurozone government bonds each month with newly created money, until at least September. Praet\u2019s comments suggest that the ECB will discuss ending QE in three months, although a final decision might not come until July\u2019s meeting. The euro has jumped by half a cent against the US dollar to $1.177, a two-week high. The Labour party have added their voice to the chorus of criticism of TSB. Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow City Minister, says: \u201cIt is deeply worrying that one month on from these issues, some TSB customers are still having difficulties. Labour echo the concerns of the FCA that communications have simply not been good enough. \u201cThere has plainly been a serious failure here, both in contingency preparations for a meltdown and in assuring an adequate level of customer communication.\u201d TSB\u2019s problems worsened last week when the bank sent letters of apology to the wrong customers. Some of the letters included other people\u2019s names, addresses and customer reference numbers. That means they could breach Britain\u2019s new data privacy laws, the General Data Protection Regulation. Andy Barratt, UK managing director of cyber security consultancy Coalfire, thinks TSB could be fined by the Information Commissioner for the breach. The ICO was also concerned that hundreds of TSB customers saw the wrong account details in the hours after April\u2019s migration. Barratt explains: \u201cThe apology letter glitch is the latest development in this ongoing TSB saga. MPs are clearly taking this issue seriously but, crucially, we\u2019re yet to see the ICO weigh in following its own investigations. The regulator will be particularly concerned that \u2018data breaches\u2019 of this magnitude have now happened more than once \u2013 both immediately before and then again after the implementation of GDPR. \u201cThe power to hand out major fines that GDPR affords the regulator means that the price of poor data protection is about to become far easier to quantify. TSB customers are still reporting problems accessing their accounts to the bank\u2019s social media unit, six weeks after the IT problems began. Many are saying they can\u2019t get through to TSB\u2019s telephone helplines.... Others report that they can\u2019t see their accounts online, or make certain payments. The Financial Conduct Authority appears to have put Paul Pester in a real spot, by accusing him of being too optimistic about the state of TSB\u2019s tech problems. If the Treasury committee feel Pester wasn\u2019t straight with them last month, they could put him under serious pressure. Pester has already given up one bonus - for completing the IT migration. Could his job be at risk? The Times\u2019s banking editor, Katherine Griffiths, suggests TSB may needed to be rebranded as Sabadell (the Spanish company which bought TSB in 2015). But Pester might not oversee such a change, if he finds himself \u201cup against the wall\u201d over his handling of the crisis, she adds. The BBC\u2019s Kevin Peachey agrees that the FCA\u2019s public criticism of a serving bank boss is pretty rare: MoneySavingExpert have put together a few questions for Paul Pester to answer at today\u2019s hearing: The number of customers that have been affected by the online and mobile banking problems and the number that are still facing problems. The number of customers that have lost money to fraudsters, whether TSB feels that after this event its account security processes are still sufficient, and the steps that are being taken to improve this. The number of customers that have switched away from the bank, and how many have reported problems - for example, being unable to switch or cancelled direct debits after switching. The minimum amount of money affected TSB customers can expect to be paid as compensation for their loss and inconvenience \u2013 this needs to be more specific than \u2018on a case-by-case basis\u2019. How will it let people proactively know what they are due? The number of complaints the bank has received from customers, the number that have now been resolved, and the average wait time these customers have experienced, both when ringing the phone lines and overall before their complaint is resolved. When TSB expects the IT problems to be fully fixed \u2013 if a date cannot be given, why not? The Treasury committee\u2019s first hearing into the TSB crisis, last month, was a very bruising experience. MPs lost patience with the bank as Paul Pester repeatedly argued that much of the IT migration had gone well (even if customers couldn\u2019t actually access their accounts). Nicky Morgan eventually let rip, telling Pester he was a \u201cstaggering example of a chief executive who seems unwilling to acknowledge the scale of the problem\u201d. Here\u2019s a clip from the May 2nd hearing: TSB is still suffering problems, more than six weeks after the ill-fated migration from its former owner Lloyds to its current owned Sabadell. The bank\u2019s service status page warns that some customers are still having issues logging into internet banking, or having difficulties making payments. Also, some Direct Debit payments weren\u2019t taken for TSB credit card customers this month. TSB also admits that some customers calling Telephone Banking are experiencing long wait times, and that its branches are busier than usual too. Nicky Morgan MP, the chair of the Treasury Committee, has piled more pressure on Paul Pester ahead of this afternoon\u2019s interrogation. Morgan says she is \u201cdeeply concerned by TSB\u2019s poor communications\u201d over its IT problems. Last week, the Financial Conduct Authority told the Committee it is \u2018dissatisfied\u2019 with TSB\u2019s communications with its customers. For example, FCA chief Andrew Bailey says that TSB claimed that \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of customers could access their online account, when in reality only 50% could successfully log in the first time they tried. That\u2019s one reason Bailey is accusing Pester of giving an \u201coptimistic\u201d view of the situation when he faced MPs last month, rather than a \u201cmore rounded view\u201d of the problems suffered by customers. Morgan says this isn\u2019t acceptable: \u201cThe regulator does not make such criticisms lightly. I am deeply concerned by TSB\u2019s poor communications about the scale and nature of the problems it has faced; by its response to customer fraud; and by the quality and accuracy of the oral and written evidence provided by Dr Pester to the Committee. \u201cThe Committee will discuss Mr Bailey\u2019s letter, and the ongoing problems faced by TSB customers, when it sees Dr Pester and other TSB Board members, as well as the FCA, on Wednesday.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The beleaguered boss of UK bank TSB is being hauled back to parliament today to face fresh questioning over the IT meltdown that left millions locked out of their accounts. Paul Pester is in the firing line over his handling of the crisis, and can expect plenty of criticism and tough questions from MPs on the Treasury Committee. Last month, the committee accused Pester of being \u2018extraordinary complacent\u2019 over the botched migration to a new technology platform, so today\u2019s session could intensify the pressure. TSB\u2019s IT crisis is one of the worst to have hit a bank ever - customers found they couldn\u2019t log on via their computer or mobile phones, small businesses were unable to pay staff, and some householders found their mortgages had disappeared. Cybercriminals have been taking advantage too, with reports that some TSB customers are falling victim to fraud. Overnight, the Financial Conduct Authority - the City\u2019s watchdog - has confirmed it is investigating the issue. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, says: \u201cWe do not normally make this information public, but, given the level of public interest, I want to be clear that we will be conducting this work.\u201d The FCA has also put Pester in the firing line, accusing him of failing to come clean about TSB\u2019s problems. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The City regulator has launched a stinging attack on the chief executive of TSB over the bank\u2019s failure to be open and transparent with customers when an IT upgrade went badly wrong, locking as many as 1.9 million customers out of their accounts. The Financial Conduct Authority accused Paul Pester of \u201cportraying an optimistic view\u201d of services after the botched operation in April that is still causing disruption for customers more than a month on. \u201cThe FCA has been dissatisfied with TSB\u2019s communications with its customers and we have had concerns that TSB was not being open and transparent about the issues experienced,\u201d Andrew Bailey, the FCA\u2019s chief executive, said in a letter to the Commons Treasury committee. In particular, the FCA think that Pester could have given MPs more information about the crisis when he initially testified on May 2nd. They believe he may have had useful information from the tech experts at IBM who have been trying to fix the problems. The session kicks off at 2.30pm, when the Treasury committee will hear from the FCA. They\u2019ll then question Pester, along with TSB chairman Richard Meddings and Miguel Montes of parent company Sabadell Group. Also coming up today More European stock markets are rising in early trading, after America\u2019s tech-focused Nasdaq index hit a record high last night. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: Tech stock were once again responsible for any excitement on Wall Street. Netflix and Amazon jumping 1.9% and 1.1% respectively boosted the Nasdaq to close at a record high at 7637. This is the second straight session where tech stocks have been under the spotlight and we are seeing a lot of positive news surrounding the sector, Microsoft buying GitHub, Apple pushing new software and Amazon sales flying, when everything else in the market is looking a little drab.

      "bodyText": "Persimmon\u2019s executive pay row was reignited on Wednesday after the head of the housebuilder\u2019s remuneration committee said she did not know how much the average worker was paid by the firm. MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee were stunned by the admission from Marion Sears, who was giving evidence after Persimmon angered shareholders earlier in the year by handing its chief executive Jeff Fairburn a \u00a375m bonus. \u201cThe average \u2026 I don\u2019t have that figure to my finger tips,\u201d Sears told MPs, when asked by the committee chair, Rachel Reeves, what average pay was. \u201cYou\u2019re chair of the remuneration committee at Persimmon aren\u2019t you? And you don\u2019t know what average pay is, as chair of the remuneration committee?\u201d asked an incredulous Reeves. After the meeting had concluded, the Labour MP tweeted that Sears\u2019 lack of knowledge was a disgrace. She added in a statement: \u201cExecutive pay at Persimmon is a tale of corporate greed and incompetent pay management, financed on the back of a tax-payer funded housing scheme [help to buy]. \u201cPersimmon paid out huge bonuses to the men at the top of the firm and yet this morning we have heard that Persimmon are unable to tell us how much average workers at the company are paid.\u201d A spokesman for the firm later confirmed the average salary at the firm is \u00a335,600. During the bruising session, Sears also appeared confused about the sum Fairburn received last year, at first answering \u201c\u00a3675,000\u201d. Prompted by Reeves to give the total pay figure, she said it was \u201cabout \u00a345m\u201d. The total figure shown in the 2017 annual report and accounts was \u00a347.1m. When asked by Reeves whether or not Persimmon was a living wage employer, Sears said yes, but then went on to clarify that the FTSE 100 firm was not accredited by the living wage foundation. \u201cIf Persimmon can pay their chief executive \u00a345m, they must ensure they pay all their staff the living wage,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cAs a committee, we shall continue to take a close eye to the issue of corporate pay and examine what impact government action, such as pay-ratio reporting, and new regulatory guidance is likely to have on delivering fair pay.\u201d Persimmon was subject of a major shareholder revolt in April over a \u00a375m bonus handed to Fairburn. Fairburn collected the first \u00a350m worth of bonus shares on 31 December and will collect the remainder of his long-term incentive plan share award on 1 July. He had been due to collect a total of \u00a3110m worth of bonus shares, but agreed to forgo 50% of the second half of the award following intense criticism. Despite anger over the level of pay, the policy was narrowly approved by shareholders as nearly a third abstained from the vote and of those who voted, 51.5% cast in favour and 48.5% against. Sears conceded to MPs that the pay row had become a debacle and admitted Persimmon had made mistakes. She said: \u201cWe would have handled it better if we\u2019d have had earlier and more joined up communication with shareholders. I think our communication was right in the end but it was late and that wasn\u2019t good.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The EU will impose tariffs on US imports ranging from Harley-Davidson motorbikes to jeans from next month in retaliation over Donald Trump\u2019s decision to put duties on European aluminium and steel. Despite the apparent reluctance of the UK\u2019s international trade secretary, Liam Fox, to publicly back the EU\u2019s proposed \u201ctit for tat\u201d measures, the European commission said it had the full support of all 28 member states to act. The EU is finalising the list it will submit to the World Trade Organization (WTO) but the bloc aims to introduce \u201crebalancing\u201d tariffs on about \u20ac2.8bn (\u00a32.5bn) worth of US steel as well as industrial and agricultural products, including bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries and orange juice. The EU has also taken a complaint to the WTO. Should the case still be ongoing after three years, the EU plans to impose further tariffs of \u20ac3.6bn on US products. Trump brought in tariffs of 25% on EU steel imports and 10% on imported aluminium on 1 June, citing \u201cnational security\u201d interests. After a meeting of senior EU officials, the European commission vice-president Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told reporters in Brussels that the EU regretted the White House\u2019s \u201cillegal\u201d act. He said: \u201cThe new duties start applying in July. It is a measured and proportionate response to the unilateral and illegal decision taken by the United States.\u201d Fox, an advocate of Brexit, has been cautious in backing the EU\u2019s retaliatory measures in public. He has also suggested that the UK is likely to be handed an exemption from the US tariffs once the country has left the EU. However, Jyrki Katainen, the commission\u2019s vice-president for jobs and a former Finnish prime minister, said that all the member states had agreed with the action to be taken against US importers and recognised the need to stand together. He said: \u201cWe have had the full support from all the member states on these issues which we are about to propose now. All the member states understand that if they want to defend rules and trade we have to play by the book. It is difficult to assess what President Trump will decide to do next but this is our response.\u201d Meanwhile the UK, France and Germany have signed a joint letter demanding that European companies are spared from US sanctions imposed on Iran after Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the nuclear agreement with Tehran known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The three EU member states were signatories to the 2015 deal, which sought to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Their letter to the US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, seeks confirmation that EU interests will not be hit by secondary sanctions on companies working in Iran. They write: \u201cBuilding on our discussions at several occasions, as close allies we expect that the extraterritorial effects of US secondary sanctions will not be enforced on EU entities and individuals, and the United States will thus respect our political decision and the good faith of economic operators within EU legal territory.\u201d",

Referring to his role as chief executive of the Gulf carrier, Akbar Al Baker stunned a press conference on Tuesday by saying: \u201cOf course, it has to be led by a man because it is a very challenging position.\u201d The comments came just after he became chair of the International Air Transport Association\u2019s board of governors for a one-year term. He later defended Qatar Airways\u2019 record on gender equality but failed to quash mounting criticism. The airline issued a statement on Tuesday referring to his \u201clightheartedness\u201d at press conferences. A day later it released another statement from Al Baker, who has run the carrier since 1997. \u201cI would like to offer my heartfelt apologies for any offence caused by my comment yesterday, which runs counter to my track record of expanding the role of women in leadership throughout the Qatar Airways Group and has been sensationalised by the media,\u201d he said. He added that women comprised 44% of the airline\u2019s workforce, and \u201cthe dedication, drive and skill they bring to their jobs tells me that no role is too tough for them, at all levels of the organisation\u201d. The Gulf carrier has a close business partnership with British Airways and is also the largest single shareholder in BA\u2019s parent company, IAG. Qatar Airways has caused controversy in the past for its treatment of its predominantly female cabin crew, at one time firing them for being pregnant. However, Al Baker said in the statement: \u201cQatar Airways firmly believes in gender equality in the workplace and our airline has been a pioneer in our region in this regard, as the first airline to employ female pilots, as one of the first to train and employ female engineers, and with females represented through to senior vice-president positions within the airline reporting directly to me.\u201d He said he supported all Iata initiatives to promote the advancement of women in the industry. It is not the first time Al Baker\u2019s comments have provoked controversy. At a dinner speech in Ireland last year, he said US airlines were \u201ccrap\u201d and their passengers were \u201calways being served by grandmothers\u201d, while boasting that \u201cthe average age of my cabin crew is only 26\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A thumping \u00a32.1bn loss on the sale of a 7.7% slug of Royal Bank of Scotland shares hurts, but let\u2019s not pretend there was a realistic prospect of making a profit for the public purse. Nor is it really correct to view the numbers through a conventional investment lens. The state\u2019s original purchase of an 83% stake in a two-stage bailout in 2008 and 2009 was not primarily done to make money. It was an emergency rescue of RBS, designed to prevent a bigger calamity in the British banking system and to avoid a deeper recession. On that score, the exercise roughly succeeded. The real mistake, in hindsight, was the failure to nationalise RBS in its entirety at the outset. One can understand why Gordon Brown\u2019s government was reluctant to go the whole hog and take 100% control: it had already nationalised Northern Rock, which was a humiliation in itself, and ministers deemed it better to retain a stock-market listing for RBS and keep the bank in touch with outside investors. That judgment, made in the midst of crisis, was reasonable at the time, so one can\u2019t be too harsh. Yet 83% ownership made it impossible to execute a good bank/bad bank split at RBS, which might have been a wiser strategy once the lid had been lifted on the horrors within. If the rotten assets had been put into longterm run off, the \u201cclean\u201d part of RBS might have done a better job of lending to the UK economy during the recession. That debate will rage for ever. In the here and now, chancellor Philip Hammond can only be criticised for poor timing. As argued here earlier this week, banks\u2019 share prices have been depressed by the political clouds over Italy; a delay of a fortnight or so might have delivered a sale price closer to 280p-290p, rather than the 271p achieved. Yet the wider principle of holding our noses and selling at a loss is reasonable. The money tied up in the shares can be put to better use elsewhere. Just improve the timing when the next batch of shares goes to market. Heathrow may face more turbulence over financial jigsaw It\u2019s a third runway at Heathrow, then \u2013 well, possibly. Parliament still has to approve and then the owners of Heathrow have to finalise their proposals and submit a planning application, which isn\u2019t scheduled to happen until 2020. But the biggest challenge is raising the finance for a scheme that is intended to be funded by the private sector. The headline \u00a314bn cost is only one figure among many. Of more relevance is the quantum of equity and debt that must be found to finance the project to completion. PwC, in its commercial viability study for the Airports Commission\u2019s 2015 report, reckoned Heathrow would require up to \u00a317.2bn of new borrowing and \u00a37bn in equity. Those are colossal sums, especially as Heathrow starts with a lot of existing debt. Indeed, the owner would have debt levels somewhere between Network Rail (about \u00a335bn at the time of the report) and National Grid (about \u00a325bn), said the report. Given that Network Rail\u2019s borrowings, for practical purposes, are guaranteed by the government, the financial arithmetic is adventurous in the extreme for a private-sector scheme. The commission still gave a thumbs-up on viability, and it\u2019s true that Heathrow currently has little difficulty raising debt at ultra-low rates. The loose piece in the financial jigsaw, however, is landing charges at the airport, which the commission\u2019s report imagined would increase but the government insists must be held in real terms. How is that going to happen? Heathrow says it has cut \u00a32.5bn from its original building budget, which is a decent saving, but its overall financing plan is still just an outline at this stage. Maybe it will get there \u2013 but it still has a very long way to go. Sky News may end up an orphan in Murdoch takeover It\u2019s taken an age, but culture secretary Matt Hancock has arrived at a sensible position on Sky. In effect, he\u2019s said he doesn\u2019t trust the Murdochs to keep their hands off Sky News, so 21st Century Fox must sell the channel if it wants to buy Sky itself. Luckily, Disney has already committed to buy Sky News and to own and fund it for 10 years as part of its wider attempt to buy Fox assets in the US. So, in practice, life should work out happily. Sky News should end up with Disney or with Comcast, the rival bidder for Sky. There is, though, one scenario in which Sky News could end as an \u201corphan\u201d, as the City puts it. That would require two things to happen. First, Fox bags Sky and Sky News goes to Disney; second, Disney fails to land the Fox assets in the US, possibly because regulators intervene. In that case, Disney would own the loss-making UK news service but no other parts of the current Murdoch empire. That would be a very bad outcome for everyone. The chain of events is unlikely \u2013 but not impossible.",

      "bodyText": "Paul Pester, the under-pressure boss of TSB, will face a second round of questions on Wednesday from MPs on the Treasury committee over the bank\u2019s botched IT upgrade that left up to 1.9 million customers locked out of their accounts. More than six weeks on from the systems meltdown, here is a timeline of how events unfolded. Friday 20 April, 4pm TSB begins a long-planned IT upgrade, transferring the records and accounts of its 5.2 million customers from a system operated by its former owner, Lloyds Banking Group, to one designed by its current owner, the Spanish bank Sabadell. TSB warns customers that some services, such as online banking and money transfers, will not be available until 6pm on Sunday 22 April. Sunday 22 April It becomes apparent that the IT migration has not gone to plan when customers attempt to log in to their accounts after 6pm. People report that accounts are showing incorrect balances, while others can see accounts belonging to other customers. Monday 23 April TSB plays down the \u201caccess issues\u201d, saying it is experiencing intermittent problems with its internet banking and mobile app, affecting a limited number of customers. However, customers in increasing numbers make their feelings known on Twitter, complaining that they cannot access their accounts. TSB\u2019s parent company, Sabadell, makes an embarrassing gaffe by publishing a statement on its website saying it has \u201csuccessfully completed the TSB technology migration\u201d. Tuesday 24 April The botched IT upgrade becomes a full-blown crisis as up to 1.9 million of TSB\u2019s online and mobile customers remain locked out of their accounts. Pester tells customers he is \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the poor service. The bank encourages people to contact its telephone banking team with any problems but some customers are left on hold for more than an hour. Pester says regulators from the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority are being briefed on developments. Wednesday 25 April Pester tweets at 3.40am to declare: \u201cOur mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running.\u201d He says for the vast majority of customers \u201ceverything is running smoothly\u201d \u2013 but customers continue to report problems. TSB says no one will be left out of pocket as a result of the IT meltdown. Thursday 26 April TSB customers have difficulty accessing their accounts for a seventh day. Pester admits \u201cwe\u2019re on our knees\u201d and announces that he has brought in a team of experts from IBM to fix the problems. The bank says it will waive \u00a310m in overdraft fees and pay extra interest on current accounts as it attempts to prevent a mass exodus of customers. Pester says he has not had time to think about whether he should resign or forgo his bonus over the fiasco. Monday 30 April The chaos enters a second week, with some TSB customers still unable to access accounts or make payments. MPs on the Treasury committee announce that they have called Pester \u2013 along with the bank\u2019s chair, Richard Meddings, and a representative from Spanish parent group Sabadell \u2013 to give evidence on the IT meltdown. Wednesday 2 May Pester appears at the Treasury committee alongside Meddings and Sabadell\u2019s Miguel Montes. Nicky Morgan, the committee\u2019s chair, accuses Pester of being \u201cextraordinarily complacent\u201d after he says the IT upgrade had mostly run smoothly. Meddings says Pester will give up a \u00a32m bonus associated with the IT migration but he could still receive up to \u00a31.3m in other bonuses for 2018, on top of a further \u00a31.3m in basic pay, benefits and pension contributions. Monday 7 May The IT meltdown enters a third week, with the beleaguered bank saying \u201cprogress is being made\u201d amid fears that a full service may not return for months. Tuesday 15 May It emerges that TSB turned down an offer of help from Lloyds Banking Group, its former owner, in the early stages of the IT meltdown. Lloyds contacted TSB on the morning of 23 April but TSB declined the offer, despite the fact its customer information was being transferred from a Lloyds system to one designed by Sabadell. Sunday 20 May Some TSB customers are still unable to make payments or access key accounts almost a month after the botched IT upgrade. Wednesday 6 June Pester receives a stinging rebuke from one of the City\u2019s top regulators. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, accuses Pester of \u201cportraying an optimistic view\u201d of services after the IT meltdown and says the bank failed to be \u201copen and transparent\u201d about the scale of the problems. The FCA \u2013 which has the power to fine TSB \u2013 is investigating the migration jointly with the Prudential Regulation Authority. Pester will face a second round of question from the Treasury Committee on Wednesday afternoon.",

The Financial Conduct Authority accused Paul Pester of \u201cportraying an optimistic view\u201d of services after the botched operation in April that is still causing disruption for customers more than a month on. \u201cThe FCA has been dissatisfied with TSB\u2019s communications with its customers and we have had concerns that TSB was not being open and transparent about the issues experienced,\u201d Andrew Bailey, the FCA\u2019s chief executive, said in a letter to the Commons Treasury committee. \u201c[T]he current communications were perceived as poor, and could reduce trust in TSB and in the banking sector as a whole.\u201d The City regulator\u2019s damning assessment increased the pressure on Pester as he prepared to make a second appearance in front of the Treasury committee on Wednesday. In a critical assessment of Pester\u2019s personal handling of the IT meltdown, Bailey also suggested that the TSB boss might have been more forthcoming with MPs on the Treasury Committee when he gave evidence on 2 May. Bailey said at the time of the hearing Pester may have had information from tech experts at IBM who had been drafted in to help cope with the meltdown. \u201cWe are \u2026 concerned that at the time of the committee hearing, the CEO may have been in possession of an initial set of slides by IBM which provided initial views on the incident, and could therefore have shared more detail on this with the committee.\u201d Bailey highlighted TSB\u2019s claim that \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of customers were able to access their online accounts at a time when there was a successful first-time login rate of only 50%. The FCA has the power to fine TSB over the incident and said it was investigating the crisis jointly with the Prudential Regulation Authority. The system failure happened when TSB transferred customer records to a new IT platform. Noting the extraordinary nature of the situation, Bailey said: \u201cWe do not normally make this information public, but given the level of public interest, I want to be clear that we will be conducting this work.\u201d He said Pester and the TSB board were accountable for the decision to press ahead with the systems upgrade. Responding to Bailey\u2019s comments, Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, said she was deeply concerned by TSB\u2019s failings. \u201cThe regulator does not make such criticisms lightly. I am deeply concerned by TSB\u2019s poor communications about the scale and nature of the problems it has faced; by its response to customer fraud; and by the quality and accuracy of the oral and written evidence provided by Dr Pester to the committee. \u201cThe committee will discuss Mr Bailey\u2019s letter, and the ongoing problems faced by TSB customers, when it sees Dr Pester and other TSB board members, as well as the FCA, on Wednesday.\u201d A spokeswoman for TSB said the bank continued to keep customers updated on its latest service status. She added: \u201cWe will be updating the Treasury select committee [on Wednesday] and will continue to fully support its inquiry. \u201cIn the meantime, we continue to focus on doing whatever it takes to put things right for our customers, and ensuring that no customer will be left out of pocket as a result of the recent IT issues.\u201d During his first encounter with MPs, Pester was accused by Morgan of being \u201cextraordinarily complacent\u201d after he said the bank\u2019s move to the new IT system had mostly run smoothly. Up to 1.9 million online and mobile banking customers at TSB began experiencing problems with their accounts on Monday 23 April after the bank \u2013 now owned by Spanish lender Sabadell \u2013 migrated from an IT system inherited from the previous owner, Lloyds Banking Group. However, some TSB customers are still facing disruption to services more than a month after the IT chaos began. The FCA said as recently as 30 May, when Bailey wrote to Morgan, phone customers were still being forced to wait more than 30 minutes to be connected to an agent, while customers were hanging up or being disconnected on more than 40% of calls. Bailey also said that the risk and scale of customer fraud had increased since the migration, and that TSB had failed to meet regulatory requirements of refunding all affected customers \u201cas soon as practicable and in any event by the end of the business day after the day which it became aware of the fraud\u201d. The FCA said \u201coperational challenges\u201d still persisted in some TSB bank branches.",

    "webTitle": "Australia's GDP growth jumps to 3.1% on back of mining exports", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s economy is growing at an annual rate of 3.1%, up from 2.4% three months ago, largely thanks to mining commodities exports. It is a significant increase in the rate of growth, in seasonally adjusted terms, and marks a strong start to 2018. Bureau of Statistics figures show the quickening pace of growth in the March quarter was mostly driven by exports of mining commodities. Export growth accounts for half the increase in gross domestic product (GDP), while government spending accounts for roughly a third. The bureau said: \u201cProduction of coal, iron ore and liquefied natural gas showed strong increases.\u201d Economists are not surprised by the increase in the growth rate. They say the result brings output growth more into line with jobs growth, which was an unsustainably-high 3.5% last year. \u201cThis is against the backdrop of stronger global growth, which accelerated in 2017 to the fastest pace since 2011,\u201d Westpac economist Andrew Hanlan said. In the last four quarters, the economy has grown by 1.01% (March quarter), 0.54% (December quarter, 2017), 0.52% (September quarter, 2017), and 1.03% (June quarter, 2017), bringing the annual growth rate to 3.1%. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, says the growth rate jumping above the long-run average again has validated the forecasts and economic outlook in his budget. \u201cIn the budget this year I said everything we endeavour to do depends on a strong economy,\u201d he said. \u201cToday\u2019s national accounts show the Turnbull government\u2019s plan for a stronger economy is working, and we need to stick to that plan.\u201d Economists say the strong lift in net exports over the last three months is unlikely to be repeated. Data shows exports of goods were up 2.9%, driven by non-rural exports, with mining commodities, liquified natural gas, coal, iron ore and non-monetary gold the main drivers, which helped net exports rebound from their poor showing in the December quarter. \u201cWe doubt that the strength of net exports will be sustained as some of it was due to a catch-up after production problems in the middle of last year,\u201d Paul Dales, the chief economist of Capital Economics, said. Another strong contributor to growth was total government final consumption expenditure. It rose 1.6% in the March quarter, and 5.1% over the last 12 months, due to continued spending on health, aged care, and disability services, thanks to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Household consumption was quite weak in the March quarter, growing by just 0.3% in the quarter. The household savings ratio also fell again, to just 2.1% - the lowest rate since December 2007. The savings ratio has declined over the past decade but the rate of decline has moderated in the past four quarters. The weak consumer spending shows households are still struggling with anaemic wages growth, with economists predicting consumer spending will remain weak for the rest of the year. \u201cThe significant headwinds faced by the household sector - weak wage growth, cooling house prices and high debt levels \u2013 continue, and are likely to weigh on consumption in 2018,\u201d NAB senior economist Gareth Spence said.",

They say the result brings output growth more into line with jobs growth, which was an unsustainably-high 3.5% last year.</p> <p>\u201cThis is against the backdrop of stronger global growth, which accelerated in 2017 to the fastest pace since 2011,\u201d Westpac economist Andrew Hanlan said.</p> <p>In the last four quarters, the economy has grown by 1.01% (March quarter), 0.54% (December quarter, 2017), 0.52% (September quarter, 2017), and 1.03% (June quarter, 2017), bringing the annual growth rate to 3.1%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4150\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Guardian Today - Australia edition\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of editors' picks and the biggest headlines each afternoon.\" data-form-campaign-code=\"AU_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"We will send you our picks of the most important headlines tomorrow morning.\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2015/dec/08/daily-email-au\">Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon</a></figcaption> </figure>  <p>The treasurer, Scott Morrison, says the growth rate jumping above the long-run average again has validated the forecasts and economic outlook in his budget.<br></p> <p>\u201cIn the budget this year I said everything we endeavour to do depends on a strong economy,\u201d he said. \u201cToday\u2019s national accounts show the Turnbull government\u2019s plan for a stronger economy is working, and we need to stick to that plan.\u201d</p> <p>Economists say the strong lift in net exports over the last three months is unlikely to be repeated.</p> <p>Data shows exports of goods were up 2.9%, driven by non-rural exports, with mining commodities, liquified natural gas, coal, iron ore and non-monetary gold the main drivers, which helped net exports rebound from their poor showing in the December quarter.</p> <p>\u201cWe doubt that the strength of net exports will be sustained as some of it was due to a catch-up after production problems in the middle of last year,\u201d Paul Dales, the chief economist of Capital Economics, said.<br></p> <p>Another strong contributor to growth was total government final consumption expenditure. </p> <p>It rose 1.6% in the March quarter, and 5.1% over the last 12 months, due to continued spending on health, aged care, and disability services, thanks to the National Disability Insurance Scheme.</p> <p>Household consumption was quite weak in the March quarter, growing by just 0.3% in the quarter. The household savings ratio also fell again, to just 2.1% - the lowest rate since December 2007. The savings ratio has declined over the past decade but the rate of decline has moderated in the past four quarters. </p> <p>The weak consumer spending shows households are still struggling with anaemic wages growth, with economists predicting consumer spending will remain weak for the rest of the year.</p> <p>\u201cThe significant headwinds faced by the household sector - weak wage growth, cooling house prices and high debt levels \u2013 continue, and are likely to weigh on consumption in 2018,\u201d NAB senior economist Gareth Spence said.</p>",
