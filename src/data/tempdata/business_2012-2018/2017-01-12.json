      "bodyText": "Rising unemployment, inequality and a lack of decent jobs have helped fuel a rise in social unrest that threatens to intensify unless policymakers take swift action, the UN\u2019s labour agency has warned. The International Labour Organization said its measure of protest activities around the world had ticked higher in the last year against a backdrop of economic and political uncertainty. In a downbeat report into global labour market prospects, the agency also predicted migration could rise over the next decade as frustrated jobseekers leave their countries in search of better prospects. After a year which involved anti-austerity protests in Brazil, demonstrations against the election of Donald Trump in the US and industrial action in the UK, the ILO said its tracking of global events showed the risk of social unrest or discontent had \u201cheightened across almost all regions\u201d. Its social unrest index increased between 2015 and 2016 to above the long-term average for the last four decades, the agency said in its latest World Employment and Social Outlook. \u201cThere is growing uncertainty everywhere it would seem, whether it\u2019s economic or political. This is something we seem to be living with and they are reinforcing one another,\u201d said Steven Tobin, ILO senior economist and lead author of the report. He drew links between that febrile climate and the rise in protests. \u201cThe ability to protest is a good thing ... we should take some solace in the fact that people are able to demonstrate but it speaks to the notion that something is broken,\u201d said Tobin. \u201cIt speaks to discontent with the socioeconomic situation, with finding a quality job and being able to share in the gains of whatever limited prosperity there is.\u201d The warning comes a day after the World Economic Forum said income inequality and the polarisation of societies posed a risk to the global economy in 2017. Before its annual meeting in Davos next week, the WEF said the gap between wealthy and poor had been behind the UK\u2019s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s election victory in the US. The ILO has also drawn links between inequality and those votes and it is predicting more discontent among workers this year. As economic growth continues to disappoint, global unemployment will rise by 3.4 million people this year, taking the jobless rate to 5.8% from 5.7% in 2016, it predicted. Small improvements across developing and developed countries would not be enough to offset deteriorating labour market conditions in emerging \u2013 or middle-income \u2013 countries, it said. \u201cThe global picture, the reality is that the gains we have seen in advanced countries are slowing and no longer able to offset the problems elsewhere,\u201d said Tobin. For those who were in work, a large proportion would continue to suffer from economic insecurity, the ILO said. It predicted vulnerable forms of employment would remain above 42% of total employment in 2017, accounting for 1.4 billion people worldwide. Examples of such work include those working for themselves or in unpaid family work with little or no social protection. The report also highlighted disparities between men and women in the world of work. For example, in northern Africa, women in the labour force were twice as likely as men to be unemployed in 2017. Vulnerable forms of employment were consistently higher for women across Africa, Asia and the Pacific and the Arab states. Partly linked to rising discontent and a lack of decent work, there had been an increase in people\u2019s willingness to migrate, the report noted. Between 2009 and 2016, the share of the working-age population willing to migrate abroad permanently increased in every region of the world except for south Asia, south-east Asia and the Pacific. \u201cOver the coming decade, the number of international migrants may increase further,\u201d the report added. The ILO echoed central bankers and groups such as the International Monetary Fund in urging policymakers to stem the rise in unemployment by increasing state spending where possible and by addressing the root causes of the economic slowdown such as income inequality. \u201cA coordinated effort to provide fiscal stimulus \u2013 an increase in public investment \u2013 that takes into account each country\u2019s fiscal space would provide an immediate jumpstart to the global economy,\u201d it concluded.",

      "bodyText": "If you\u2019re a fund manager who returned 3.2% in 2016, a year in which the UK stock market improved almost 17%, you need to offer your investors an explanation. Here\u2019s Neil Woodford\u2019s: it was a momentum-driven market and he\u2019s a manager who looks for fundamental value. He hunted for that value in some rotten places, such as Capita and Next, but he makes a fair statistical point. The market went crazy for oils and commodity stocks last year, sectors avoided by Woodford\u2019s \u00a39.6bn UK Equity Income fund. If you strip out the six biggest oil and mining heavyweights, plus HSBC, the FTSE All-Share index improved by 8.2%, not the actual 16.8%. Woodford argues he was right to ignore oil and mining heavyweights (their recovery since the lows for commodity prices in 2015 \u201cgoes way beyond what fundamentals would justify\u201d) but then he makes a much bigger claim. He says current momentum market reminds him of 1999 and the tech and dotcom bubble. \u201cValuation has become significantly less important \u2013 indeed, arguably irrelevant in this sort of post-Trump period,\u201d he says. In other mouths, that might sound like a excuse too far for a bad year. But Woodford made his reputation by ignoring the turn-of-the-century new-technology obsession and sticking with supposedly dull dividend earners. After the bust of 2000, he reaped the rewards. There is no guarantee that history will repeat, or even rhyme, and Woodford has investors to keep sweet. But, on a day that the FTSE 100 index edged to another record close, the basic point should be well understood: the market has been led by a narrowly concentrated collection of stocks, which makes it fragile. The Tesco supertanker is finding it tough to turn around Once the Tesco supertanker turns, watch it plough through the flotilla of lesser food retailers, ran last year\u2019s theory. Life is not working out so simply, or at least not yet. Trading from September to New Year was good enough for chief executive Dave Lewis to declare himself \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by \u201csustained strong progress\u201d but investors were less impressed. The shares closed down 1.3%. One can understand why. From UK like-for-like sales growth of 1.8% in the September-November period, Tesco slipped to 0.7% over Christmas and its explanation descended into nit-picking. The chain didn\u2019t repeat a \u201cboost\u201d promotion on loyalty points, which it reckons cost 0.8% on sales. But dropping the wheeze was a deliberate policy. The idea was to ween the punters off from promotional gimmicks by offering them \u201ceven more affordable prices\u201d, as Lewis puts it. The outcome suggests limited success. For true Tesco nerds, there was a profits upgrade within the statement if one looked hard enough. Instead of full-year operating profits of \u00a31.2bn, the group now expects \u201cat least\u201d that figure. But that is nuance upon nuance. The big picture remains the same. Tesco\u2019s recovery is happening, and it is regaining small slices of market share, but the process feels terribly slow. To be fair to Lewis, he never said it would be quick. What\u2019s more, after previous management\u2019s catastrophic blunder in chasing self-defeating targets for profit margins, you can\u2019t blame him for deciding the priority was to fix the offer for customers. Even so, Morrisons was in a similar pickle and is recovering faster. Maybe smaller supermarkets are just easier to turn around than big ones. Whatever Lewis says about being very encouraged, one suspects he would have hoped to have achieved more by now. This was his third Christmas in charge and the share price stands where it was after his first. M&amp;S knows sales are not just for Christmas Over at Marks &amp; Spencer, Steve Rowe is new(ish) in post but knows the first lesson of Christmas: don\u2019t read too much into it. For most of the past half-decade, the sight of growth in clothing and homeware sales \u2013 2.3% on a like-for-like basis \u2013 might have been greeted with claims about corners being turned. It\u2019s too soon to say that. As M&amp;S volunteered, the clothing improvement was flattered by five extra days in the reporting period. Call the real figure about 0.8% on a truer comparative. Such an increase was also merely part of the script as M&amp;S attempts to rid itself of its addiction to short-term discounts to sell more of its clothes at full price. The company\u2019s guidance that pre-tax profits will be \u00a3593m-ish this year was left intact. That was the significant point in the statement. The chief revelations probably lie elsewhere. First, Next\u2019s Christmas shocker looks even worse in light of M&amp;S\u2019 performance. Second, all retailers \u2013 especially the non-food variety \u2013 are staring at polls of consumer confidence and do not like what they say for 2017. Rowe referred to \u201cthe uncertain consumer outlook\u201d but John Lewis, obliged to decide its staff bonus in March, has already concluded that a benign Christmas could be a poor guide for the year ahead. The bonus will be \u201csignificantly lower\u201d this time, in part because \u201csterling is a dog that hasn\u2019t barked yet\u201d. But it\u2019s the bite, not the bark, retailers should fear.

      "bodyText": "Legions of \u201cBrexit tourists\u201d flocked to the UK to take advantage of the weak pound over Christmas, triggering a huge rise in spending on foreign credit cards. Foreign shoppers spent more than \u00a3725m on the British high street during December, up 22% or an extra \u00a3130m compared to the previous year, according to payments processing firm Worldpay. Bargain-hunters from Hong Kong were the biggest spenders, closely followed by visitors from the United States, United Arab Emirates and mainland China. Worldpay put the rise in foreign shoppers down to the slump in the value of sterling, which has fallen 18% against the dollar and 12% against the euro since the UK voted to leave the European Union. The fall has burnished the UK\u2019s international image as a shopping destination because it makes goods cheaper for foreigners changing their domestic currency into pounds. Worldpay\u2019s chief marketing officer, James Frost, said overseas visitors had helped offset the impact of British people shunning the high street in favour of shopping online. \u201cBricks and mortar retailers have not had things all their own way this Christmas, with the latest reports suggesting UK consumers are increasingly doing the bulk of their shopping online. \u201cSo the influx of free-spending tourists we saw in December will have been a welcome boost for retailers looking to balance the books.\u201d He added: \u201cUK retail centres, including London\u2019s West End, are a magnet for visitors from all over the world, made all the more attractive by the bargains on offer as a result of the weakened pound.\u201d December also proved a strong month for upmarket hospitality group D&amp;D, which owns restaurants including Quaglino\u2019s in London and Crafthouse in Leeds. Its UK revenues were up 7% on a like-for-like basis, stripping out the impact of new restaurant openings, while sales were up 14% on New Year\u2019s Eve, rounding off what it called a \u201ctopsy-turvy\u201d year. But the chairman and chief executive, Des Gunewardena, warned that the hospitality group, which also owns restaurants in New York, Paris and Tokyo, was expecting a tough 2017 due to Brexit. \u201cDespite an excellent end to 2016 we have no illusions about how challenging 2017 is likely to be, with continuing worries about Brexit and cost inflation on all fronts,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s best known fund manager has likened the current stock market euphoria to the dotcom bubble, even as the FTSE 100 closed at yet another record high. After a volatile day\u2019s trading, the leading index finished 1.88 points higher at 7292.37, marking the 11th consecutive day of record closes and the market\u2019s 13th successive daily rise. But Neil Woodford, who admitted his own fund\u2019s performance in 2016 was disappointing, said the current situation reminded him of the technology bubble which reached a peak on the last day of 1999 and then burst dramatically. He said : \u201cThere was a period then when fundamentals didn\u2019t matter at all and markets just became completely momentum-orientated. There was no price that people wouldn\u2019t pay to be positioned in technology stocks and no price that they wouldn\u2019t sell shares that were focused on the old economy. \u201cAnd in a similar sort of way \u2013 maybe not to the same extreme, but in a similar way, we have seen 2016 play out like that. Valuation has become significantly less important. Indeed, arguably irrelevant in this sort of post-Trump period. Momentum has driven the share prices, not fundamentals.\u201d Global markets have been buoyed by president elect Donald Trump\u2019s promises to introduce measures to boost economic growth. On top of that the FTSE 100 has been lifted by a fall in sterling since the Brexit vote, which has helped those companies which make most of their earnings overseas and has also made UK businesses cheaper for overseas investors. An early rise in the pound on Thursday, as the dollar weakened, sent the index lower in early trading. The slump in the greenback, which pushed the pound up nearly 1% to $1.2316, followed disappointment that Trump had not given details of his proposed spending and tax plans at Wednesday\u2019s press conference. Pharmaceutical companies, hit by renewed threats by Trump to cut the prices they charge for their drugs, were among the losers, while Christmas trading statements from UK retailers proved a mixed bag. But sterling lost its gains as the day progressed and was marginally lower at $1.221 by the time the London stock market closed, helping the leading index edge to its new peak. In the US, the disappointment with Trump\u2019s press conference performance and the lack of economic news from the president-elect sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 152 points to 19,802 by lunchtime. On Friday, it had come within one point of breaching the elusive 20,000 barrier. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: \u201cThe apparent demise of the rally is being blamed on disappointment following the president-elect\u2019s press conference, but in reality the surge was already running on air, with US markets in particular having essentially gone nowhere since mid-December. This fact was masked by the ongoing hope of Dow 20,000, but it looks like this has been scrubbed from the timetable for the next few weeks.\u201d In the eurozone, a stronger euro saw Germany\u2019s Dax drop 1% and France\u2019s Cac close down 0.5% with exporters among the leading fallers.",

      "bodyText": "As the dollar weakened and US markets fell on disappointment at the lack of details of Donald Trump\u2019s economic plans at Wednesday\u2019s press conference, markets suffered a tricky day. The FTSE 100 fell back initially as the pound gained ground, hitting overseas earners, and pharmaceutical shares dropped after Trump\u2019s talk of clamping down on the prices they charged for their medicines. But as the pound dipped later in the session, the FTSE 100 just about managed to end in positive territory, its 11th successive closing high. But in Europe a rise in the euro - due to the weak dollar as well as the minutes of the last ECB meeting - left markets flagging. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 1.88 points or 0.03% at 7292.37 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.07% to 11,521.04 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.51% at 4863.97 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.69% to 19,156.59 Spain\u2019s Ibex edged down 0.01% to 9407.4 But in Greece, the Athens market added 0.28% to 665.21 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down around 20 points at 19,834 - well off the 20,000 barrier it almost breached last Friday. On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The FTSE 100 rally might not have much further to go, says Capital Economics. The think tank\u2019s John Higgins said: It is tempting to attribute the FTSE 100\u2019s winning streak to a renewed plunge in sterling. But other factors have also been at play. These include higher commodity prices, the resilience of the UK economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit and spill-over effects from Trump\u2019s election victory. Looking ahead, we remain positive on the FTSE 100, but don\u2019t expect it to make much more headway. We doubt that there is much life left in the FTSE 100 rally.. Indeed, we forecast that it will end 2017 at 7,500, which is only about 3% above its level today. Granted, we expect the UK economy to continue to fare quite well. However, there are three reasons why we are cautious. First, we forecast a small gain in sterling in trade-weighted terms, as a further decline against the dollar (to $1.20/\u00a3 from $1.23/\u00a3) is more than offset by a rise against the euro (to \u20ac1.26/\u00a3 from \u20ac1.15/\u00a3). Second, we expect the rally in oil prices to peter out. Our end-year forecast for Brent crude is $60pb, which is not much above its price today (around $56pb). And third, we think the US stock market will run out of steam, as the enthusiasm with which shareholders greeted Trump\u2019s victory starts to wane and profit margins are squeezed. Our end-2017 forecast for the S&amp;P 500 is only 2,300, which is barely above its level now. Commenting on the market falls, Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: After briefly sneaking into positive territory the FTSE slipped back into the red this afternoon, with the index\u2019s 2017 winning streak potentially about to come to an end. Despite a largely healthy set of commodity stocks, and a wave of positive Christmas updates from its key retailers, it seems like there was just too much going on for the FTSE this Thursday. The negative reaction to some of those trading statements, most notably Tesco and Primark-owner Associated British Foods, alongside the pound\u2019s rebound against the dollar, largely prompted by the greenback\u2019s own weaknesses, prevented the UK index from building beyond the 7300 it struck yesterday. Over in the US things took a rather sharp turn downwards, with the Dow Jones plunging by 150 points after the bell. It seems that both the Dow and the dollar are still displeased with the lack of policy detail in Donald Trump\u2019s press conference on Wednesday. Especially disgruntled are the US pharmaceutical stocks, the likes of Shire and Pfizer continuing yesterday\u2019s losses after the President-elect claimed that the sector was \u2018getting away with murder\u2019 in regards to drug prices. In the Eurozone, meanwhile, the DAX and CAC incurred some hefty losses as the euro hit a one month high against the dollar and took 0.3% off the pound. The currency appeared to be prompted by the latest ECB meeting minutes released this afternoon, with the central bank apparently fairly divided ahead of their to extend QE at a reduced rate of purchase. It looks like the chances of the Dow Jones Industrial Average breaking through the 20,000 barrier in the near future are getting slimmer, nor is the FTSE 100 currently on course to continue its record breaking run of closing highs. The Dow is currently down 144 points at 19,810 on continuing disappointment with the lack of detail from Donald Trump on his spending and tax plans. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has slipped 9 points to 7281, having climbed as high as 7302 and fallen as low as 7263. Back with UK retailers, and we\u2019ve taken a look at the Christmas winners and losers so far. (Spoiler: most of them are winners). The full report is here: With the dollar weakening after president-elect Donald Trump failed to spell out any spending or tax plans in Wednesday\u2019s press conference, US markets have fallen back in early trading. After ending nearly 100 points higher on Wednesday after a volatile session as Trump spoke, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has now gone into reverse, down 75 points or 0.37% to 19.879. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both slipped around 0.3% at the open. US markets, indeed global markets, have seen sharp rises recently, partly fuelled by Trump\u2019s declarations of increased spending and other measures to boost the economy. Investors had been hoping for more details at Wednesday\u2019s event, but in the end were disappointed. Oil prices are moving higher on reports that Opec members are sticking to the production cuts agreed last November. Reuters reports: Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam Al-Marzouq told [an Abu Dhabi] conference Kuwait had already cut its oil output by more than it promised under the OPEC deal, without giving further details. Iraq Oil Minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi told reporters Iraq was \u201choping for a better price\u201d. Iraq had reduced its oil exports by 170,000 bpd and was cutting them by a further 40,000 bpd this week, he said. BMI Research said overall \u201ccompliance to the OPEC/non-OPEC oil production cut appears to be positive ... We calculate compliance with production cuts at around 73 percent,\u201d led by high compliance from members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, namely Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman. Crude has also been boosted by news of record Chinese car sales, which grew by 13.7% in 2016. Brent is currently up 2.12% at $56.27 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate has climbed 2.05% to $53.32. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose by less than expected last week. Initial benefit claims rose by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 247,000, compared to forecasts of an increase to 255,000. The previous week\u2019s figure of 235,000 was revised upwards by 2,000, the US Labor Department said. The benefit claim number has been below 300,000 - a level seen as indicating a healthy jobs market - for 97 consecutive weeks, the longest streak since 1970. The euro has hit a one month high of $1.0683 against the dollar after the ECB minutes showed a split on extending the central bank\u2019s bond buying programme. The rise is also due to weakness in the dollar following a lack of detail about Donald Trump\u2019s spending and tax plans at Wednesday\u2019s press conference. The European Central Bank\u2019s decision to extend its bond buying programme followed signs of a continuing moderate recovery in the eurozone economy, but insufficient progress towards a sustained pick up in inflation. At its December meeting the ECB decided to extend the programme by nine months to December 2017 but cut the monthly amount of bonds bought from \u20ac80bn to \u20ac60bn, but there were some differences of opinion according to the just-released minutes. Some members initially preferred to keep things as they were, as that had the merit of continuity and was in line with market expectations. But the minutes said the option of extending the programme \u201callowed for a more sustained market presence and, therefore, a more lasting transmission of the Governing Council\u2019s stimulus measures.\u201d And it meant that if the recovery faltered the decision could be reversed. The minutes said: \u201cAt the same time, if the outlook became less favourable, or if financial conditions became inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment of the inflation path, the Governing Council could return to a pace of \u20ac80 billion per month.\u201d So although the change was eventually implemented, some members remained opposed: \u201cA few members could not support either of the two options that had been proposed, while welcoming the scaling-down of purchases and other elements of the proposals, in view of their well-known general scepticism regarding the APP [asset purchase programme] and public debt purchases in particular.\u201d After a volatile performance during president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s press conference, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day 98 points higher at 19,954, heading back towards the elusive 20,000 barrier. But the futures market is suggesting the Dow will dip back down again at the open, with a fall of around 42 points forecast at the moment. The weekly jobless figures, due before the US market opens, could have some influence and are expected to rise from last week\u2019s near 43 year low. Here\u2019s our story on the John Lewis bonus cut. Sarah Butler writes: John Lewis has warned that its annual bonus for staff will be significantly lower than last year as it prepares to take a hit from the post-Brexit slump in sterling. Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the staff-owned group, which includes Waitrose, said he anticipated a \u201cchallenging\u201d year ahead as retailers would have to absorb a big chunk of the rising cost of importing goods just as they are coping with shoppers\u2019 shift to buying online.... Mayfield said the devaluation of sterling was \u201cone of the most significant factors overhanging the outlook for the year ahead.\u201d This will be the fourth consecutive year that the group, which is collectively owned by its staff, has reduced the payout, but it is highly unusual for it to cut the bonus when profits rise. Last year its 91,500 employees, known as partners, were awarded bonuses of 10% of salary, the lowest for 13 years, averaging just over \u00a31,500 each. The bonus payout started in 1920. It was suspended during the second world war and the early 1950s recession, and peaked at 24% of salary in the 1980s. The highest payout in recent years was 18% in 2011. The full report is here: Here\u2019s a quick roundup of the day\u2019s main retail updates from George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: The first set of positive like-for-likes in the Clothing and Home division for almost two years is the main headline at M&amp;S. While last year\u2019s frankly abysmal performance was hardly a tough benchmark to beat, investors will be hoping that Steve Rowe\u2019s plans to revitalise the group gain some traction and this marks the start of a more positive trajectory. There was some Christmas cheer at M&amp;S\u2019 high street rival Debenhams too. The group gathered momentum through the all-important Christmas quarter, rounding it off in style by upping like-for-like sales by 5% in the seven weeks to 7 January. It wasn\u2019t just in stores that things look brighter either. Online sales jumped 17% in that period. It was more of a mixed bag at John Lewis, however. While sales growth of almost 5% means that the tills were certainly ringing, the group says that greater challenges across the retail sector, notably the continuing shift to online, means that profit is likely to come under pressure. Unfortunately for those at the group, the likely upshot here is a significantly lower bonus than last year. To see evidence of that shift to online spending, look no further than the 30% sales growth that Asos pulled in at the back end of last year. With more customers ordering more often, expectations for full year sales growth have been raised, but this means extra investment too. The group will need to spend another \u00a330m to keep up with the relentlessly increasing demand. This is one of the better problems to have, we feel. Primark owner Associated British Foods doesn\u2019t do online shopping. Instead, the focus for the retail division is on rolling out its pile it high, sell it cheap format across Europe and the US. With expansion continuing apace, investors may be excused for being a touch disappointed by the 11% growth in sales reported today. Square footage increased by 12% in the last year. Still with the economy, and eurozone industrial production rose more sharply than expected in November. Output climbed by 1.5% month on month compared to forecasts of a 0.5% increase. Year on year it rose 3.2%, much better than the 1.6% expected. The October figures were revised upwards, with a 0.1% rise month on month compared to an earlier reported fall of 0.1%. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: After stuttering throughout the summer, industrial production in the eurozone bounced back with a vengeance in November, which will give the ECB serious grounds for confidence at this early stage in 2017. The outlook remains weighed down by continued political uncertainty, but the recovery in the region is gathering some real momentum. Unemployment is falling, business confidence is up and the weak euro is a real boost for exporters. Although Mario Draghi and his ECB colleagues are still faced with some very real political threats, the economy is standing up well in the face of adversity. The ECB is due to announce its latest monetary policy deliberations next Thursday. Back with the industrial production figures and Howard Archer, economist at IHS Markit, was also positive but warned of an uncertain outlook: Even allowing for the fact that industrial production has been highly erratic, November\u2019s jump reinforces our belief that Eurozone GDP growth could well have reached 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016. This would be up from 0.3% in both the third and second quarters. It appears that the Eurozone manufacturing sector carried decent momentum into 2017, and they will be helped by the very competitive euro... Looking ahead, a concern for Eurozone manufacturers will be that mounting uncertainty over the coming months (particularly political) could cause business and consumers to be cautious in their major spending decisions, thereby constraining demand for capital goods and big-ticket consumer durable goods It is also very possible that purchasing power for Eurozone consumers\u2019 will become less favourable as inflation picks up, thereby weighing down on demand for big-ticket consumer durables. In particular, an uncertain political environment could be increasingly problematic for Eurozone growth prospects over the coming months, especially given that the UK\u2019s Brexit vote last June and November\u2019s election of Donald Trump as US President fuels concern over potential political shocks. General elections are due 2017 in the Netherlands (in March), France (in April/May) and Germany (in September), while a 2017 election is very possible in Italy following Prime Minister Renzi\u2019s early-December defeat in the referendum on constitutional reform which has led to his resignation. And Capital Economics pointed out: Good news for the eurozone as the Germany economy, the major driver of growth in the region, recorded its best performance for five years in 2016. German GDP grew by 1.9% last year, up from 1.7% in 2015 and better than the expected 1.8% rise. The economy was boosted by strong domestic demand, compensating for sluggish demand for exports. ING economist Carsten Brzeski said the German economy remained an \u201cisland of happiness\u201d, adding: The German economy has once again defied several deep hits. Despite the stock market crash in China, Brexit, Turkey, Trump and Italy, the economy performed its best growth year since 2011. Strong domestic demand has shielded the German economy against most external risks. And he said the biggest risk to future growth was complacency: [2016] was a year in which the German economy proved to be more robust than many thought and in which the economy weathered a series of external risks extremely well, thanks to strong domestic demand. In fact, the often controversially discussed refugee crisis and the ECB\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy turned out to be an economic blessing, artificially extending the long, positive cycle of the economy. The year 2017 will in our view look very much like 2016, only with a bit less of everything. Domestic demand, ie construction and both private and public consumption, should remain the main growth drivers. The biggest risk for the economy is not Trump or political populism in the Eurozone but self-complacency. The economy urgently needs new impetus from new structural reforms and stronger public and private investment. It is very unlikely that it will get any of these before the elections. UniCredit economist Andreas Rees was also positive: The German economy remains a stronghold of continuity. With plus 1.9% in 2016, its growth performance was rock solid and even accelerated to its strongest pace in the last five years (2015: +1.7%; 2014: +1.6%). Once again, the major driver was domestic demand in the form of private and public consumer expenditures and not export activity. Imports were even outpacing exports last year. Taking a glimpse into 2017, the German economy remains fundamentally in good shape. The growth drivers will change somewhat, since there will be a (moderate) shift from domestic demand to stronger export activity. What can go wrong? It goes without saying that there are substantial political risks, especially from the US, which could have an (indirect) impact on German exports. Whether and how this will play out still remains to be seen. For 2017, we expect \u201conly\u201d GDP growth of 1.5%. Please note that the reason for the drop is NOT based on fundamentals and definitely not a reason to be worried. Instead, the lower number of working days is artificially weighing on the headline growth number (calendar-day adjusted growth in 2017: +1.8% after also +1.8% last year). Speaking of Donald Trump, one market moving comment in his press conference related to pharmaceutical companies. He said drugs companies were \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d in the prices they charged and promised that would change. That sent US pharma stocks lower, and theat sentiment has carried over into Europe. So Shire, Hikma, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca have all seen their shares fall. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: If pharmaceutical companies were hoping for an easier ride from President elect Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton they were quickly disabused of this notion last night when the President elect let rip at the industry\u2019s pricing policies. Last year was notable for a number of stories related to price gouging including the Mylan story around the Epipen price hikes, and Valeant\u2019s policy of buying older niche drugs and then hiking the prices aggressively, and the antipathy that resulted from these stories has made the industry an easy target for a President who may feel compelled to get some quick political wins. At a time when pharmaceutical companies were hoping for a more benign investment environment last night\u2019s remarks were a reminder, if any were needed, as well as a warning to the sector and other sectors as well, of the President elects propensity to adopt a scatter gun approach to domestic policy. Investors would do well to bear this in mind given that the recent stock market rally doesn\u2019t appear to have factored this into their investment scenarios. The Trump Presidency is unlikely to be a one way bet for stock markets. A stronger pound is also taking some of the shine off the leading index. One of the driving factors behind the recent surge in the FTSE 100 to record levels has been the weakness of sterling, which benefits overseas earners and makes UK assets more attractive to international investors. But disappointment that president-elect Donald Trump - in his first press conference since July - failed to spell out details of his plans to boost the US economy with infrastructure spending and new tax measure has sent the dollar lower. Against the US currency the pound has added 0.32% to $1.2252, although sterling is virtually flat against the euro at \u20ac1.1528. The FTSE 100 has slipped back after its record breaking run of ten consecutive closing highs, and is currently down 0.22% at 7274. Retailers have received a mixed reception to their Christmas updates, with Marks &amp; Spencer and JD Sports moving sharply higher, but Tesco, Primark owner Associated British Foods and AO World all disappointing investors. Stockbrokers Shore Capital are extremely unamused that Tesco, M&amp;S, Debenhams, ASOS et al all decided to release their results today in a \u201cchaotic\u201d splurge. They say: The British retail trade has decided to make many market updates today. Such dis-coordination, to put it politely, does not serve shareholders and investors well. Investor relations executives should hold their respective heads in shame at the chaotic volume of information coming out today whilst seeking for a more balanced information flow in 2018. As feared, AO World\u2019s cautious trading statement has gone down badly in the City. Shares in the online electrical supplier have slumped by 8.7%, after it warned that the economic outlook is uncertain. Conservative MP Margot James has applauded John Lewis and Marks &amp; Spencer for their Christmas performance: The Daily Mail\u2019s Sabah Meddings tweets more details: As if we didn\u2019t have enough to deal with, John Lewis has decided to put its Christmas trading figures out today too. And it has warned its staff that their famous annual bonus is likely to be rather lower this year, even though sales and profits have risen. Like-for-like sales at John Lewis stores rose by 2.7% in the six weeks to December 31, while Waitrose like-for-like sales were up 2.8%. A successful promotional campaign, including one day only offers for Christmas staples, such as champagne and crackers, proved effective in building footfall in the pre-Christmas period. Profits for the year to 28 January 2017 will probably be up on last year, thanks to lower pension charges. But JLP says that trading profits are under pressure, due to the boom in internet shopping and the fall in the pound. The most obvious of these changes is the channel shift from shops to online. The other major influence is pricing, where deflation continues in food and non-food, despite rising input costs as a result of weakness in the Sterling exchange rate. These factors are significant for the outlook where we expect both inflationary cost pressures and competition to intensify in the market as a whole. The rate of retail market sales growth may slow and the rate of profit growth that is achievable will be affected by margin pressure. And staff are going to be hit in the pocket, when the bosses decide how much of the profits to share with them. The Partnership Board will decide on the level of Bonus in March, but, given the challenging market outlook and the importance of investment for the future, the Board expects that bonus is likely to be significantly lower than last year. Boom! Shares in JD Sports have hit a new all-time high, romping up by 6% to 346p. That puts it top of the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies. Traders are applauding the firm\u2019s 10% jump in sales over Christmas And finally, here are those smaller retailers... Baby goods retailer Mothercare has reported a 1% jump in like-for-like sales in the last quarter, driven by online sales. More here. Fashion chain SuperGroup says it had a good half-year, with revenues rising to \u00a3334.0m, from \u00a3254.7m. More here. Top hat and tails purveyor Moss Bros has posted a 6% jump in like-for-like sales. CEO Brian Brick says \u201congoing investment in new and refitted stores\u201d is paying off. More here. Dunelm, the homewares firm, had a solid but unspectacular festive period with like-for-like sales up 0.2%. More here. No drama at food wholesale chain Booker Group; it\u2019s on track to hit City forecasts this year. Online fashion chain ASOS has reported bumper sales growth over Christmas, up 18% in the UK. International sales surged by 52%, as ASOS benefits from the weak pound, and the company is now planning to upgrade its systems and processes to handle higher demand. CEO Nick Beighton says: \u201cWith sales for the year now expected to be up by c.25 percent to 30 percent, we\u2019re accelerating our infrastructure investment to handle that growth.\u201d Tesco\u2019s shares have fallen by 2.3% in early trading. That making it the worst-performing member of the FTSE 100, even though it grew sales by 0.7% over Christmas. Tesco is holding a conference call now, and saying it\u2019s not seen any change in UK consumer spending since the EU referendum. John Ibbotson of Retail Vision argues that Tesco\u2019s results are encouraging: \u201cTesco\u2019s revival continues apace, with a strong Christmas trading period and third quarter.\u201dMore ominously for its competitors, Tesco has managed to increase its market share in a period of cut-throat competition. Shares in M&amp;S have jumped by almost 5% at the start of trading, as investors cheer its best festive performance for six years. That\u2019s makes it the best-performing share on the FTSE 100. My colleague Zoe Wood explains: Marks &amp; Spencer has ended the long-running slump in sales at is clothing arm with its best Christmas performance for six years. The retailer said like-for-like clothing sales were up by 2.3% in the 13 weeks to 31 December. This time last year clothing sales had slumped by nearly 6%. M&amp;S chief executive Steve Rowe said \u201cbetter ranges, better availability and better prices\u201d had helped it improve its performance in a difficult marketplace. To win back shoppers, Rowe has already cut clothing prices and promised to pay more attention to its most loyal group of shoppers \u2013 fiftysomething women he has dubbed \u201cMrs M&amp;S\u201d. He also slashed the number of promotions run by the store. More here: Online electricals retailer AO World has dampened the mood, despite decent sales growth over Christmas. AO says that it is cautious about trading conditions, due to \u201cthe uncertain UK economic outlook, currency impacts on supplier pricing and the possible effect on consumer demand\u201d On the upside, total revenues in the three months to December 31 were up 12.3% year-on-year. But that may not be enough to cheer investors. CEO John Roberts says: Looking ahead we have three months left of the current financial year and are mindful of the uncertain economic outlook. However, we remain confident that our market leading proposition will continue to drive customers to experience the AO Way and enter the New Year excited by the opportunities ahead.\u201d JD Sports has also reported strong sales and expects to beat City forecasts for profits in the current year. It said the like-for-like growth of about 10% achieved in the first half had continued in the second half of its financial year to 7 January. JD now expects that headline profit before tax and one-off items for the current financial year will exceed analysts\u2019 expectations of \u00a3200m by up to 15%. Peter Cowgill, executive chairman, said: \u201cWhilst we acknowledge that it would be unreasonable to expect like for like sales growth to be maintained at recent levels for a fifth consecutive year, we are confident that both domestically and internationally, our unique and often exclusive sports fashion premium brand offer provides a solid foundation for future development.\u201d The trading update did not mention the firm\u2019s investigation into conditions at its Kingsway warehouse near Rochdale after a Channel 4 documentary found workers claiming it was \u201cworse than a prison\u201d. City veteran David Buik reckons JD have outperformed Sports Direct. City commentators are fairly impressed with the results of Retail Super Thursday. Here\u2019s ITV\u2019s Chris Choi: The BBC\u2019s Dominic O\u2019Connell points out that M&amp;S\u2019s 2.3% jump in clothing/home sales are flattered by an extra week\u2019s trading - take that out, and it only grew by 0.8%. Still growth, though! The BBC\u2019s Emma Simpson flags up that Tesco is growing market share again, after a five-year haitus: Resolution Group\u2019s Duncan Weldon says the UK consumer seems to be in good spirits over Christmas: Associated British Foods, the firm behind the Primark chain, says that trading across its business was \u201cgood\u201d in the last 16 weeks. However, we don\u2019t have any like-for-like figures for Primark. Total sales at Primark were up 11% year-on-year in \u2018constant currency terms\u2019, or a chunky 22% in actual currency terms (thanks to the fall in sterling). ABF says: The UK performed well. Like-for-like sales for the period were good and market share increased reflecting the strength of our consumer offering. Like-for-like sales for the group were held back by declines, albeit smaller than last year, in Germany and the Netherlands, the latter particularly affected by the rapid increase in selling space. Onto Debenhams...and it\u2019s also beaten forecasts as customers clamoured for beauty products and gifts. My colleague Julia Kollewe has taken a look, and reports: Debenhams has reported better than expected Christmas trading. Like-for-like sales grew 5% in the seven weeks to 7 January and were up 1.7% at constant exchange rates. Over the 18 weeks to 7 January, group like-for-like sales at constant exchange rates edged up 0.5%, with UK sales stronger, at 1% growth. Analysts had expected a 1% drop in underlying sales. The retailer said beauty and gift sales grew strongly to take the non-clothing sales mix to 57%. It has cut back on promotions overall but said it had a successful Black Friday. Tesco has also posted a decent-looking performance over Christmas, with a 0.7% rise in like-for-like sales in the UK - driven by sales of toys and clothes. That\u2019s despite not repeating last year\u2019s loyalty card promotion which it said had hit performance by 0.8%. Here\u2019s the details: Food like-for-like sales up 1.3%, with significant market outperformance in fresh food Impact of minus 0.8% on total UK like-for-like sales from not repeating Clubcard \u2018Boost\u2019 promotion, leading to lower general merchandise sales Strong performance in clothing and toys, with sales up 4.3% and 8.5% respectively CEO Dave Lewis says this is Tesco\u2019s third successful Christmas in a row We are very encouraged by the sustained strong progress that we are making across the Group. In the UK, we saw our eighth consecutive quarter of volume growth and delivered a third successful Christmas. Our fresh food ranges proved particularly popular, outperforming the market with great quality, innovative new products and even more affordable prices. Internationally, we have continued to focus on improving our offer for customers in challenging market conditions. We are well-placed against the plans we shared in October to become more competitive for customers, simpler for colleagues, and an even better partner for our suppliers, whilst creating long-term value for our shareholders. I would like to thank all of our colleagues for everything they have done to serve our customers brilliantly over this very busy period.\u201d Today\u2019s results are a boost to Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s new CEO, Steve Rowe, who recently announced a turnaround plan for the business centered on its food business. Rowe says: \u201cI am pleased with the customer response we have seen to the changes we are making in line with our plan for the business. I would like to thank the whole team for their hard work over this busy period. \u201cIn Clothing &amp; Home, better ranges, better availability and better prices helped to improve our performance in a difficult marketplace. We also continued to substantially reduce discounting, including over Black Friday. \u201cOur Food business continues to grow market share with customers recognising our product as special and different. Our Simply Food store pipeline remains strong.\u201d Rowe warms, though, that consumer confidence remains \u201cuncertain\u201d in 2017. Marks &amp; Spencer has beaten City forecasts, with sales growth across its food, clothing and homeware operations. The high-street chain grew its like-for-like sales in the UK by 1.3%, led by a 2.3% jump in clothes and homeware. That\u2019s a welcome return to form for M&amp;S, after years of underperformance in this area. Food sales also did well, up 0.6% in a like-for-like basis (stripping out new stores). Here\u2019s the details: And we\u2019re off! A mass of trading news is flashing across the wires as all 12 retailers report their results to the City. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. They\u2019re calling it Retail Super Thursday in the City. No fewer than 12 of Britain\u2019s shopping groups are reporting their financial results for the Christmas period this morning, giving a crucial insight into the UK economy. The list includes several big names -- Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco and Debenhams, along with JD Sports, SuperGroup, Mothercare, Associated British Foods (the owner of Primark), Moss Bros, ASOS, Booker Group, Dunelm, and AO.com. Veteran analyst Nick Bubb sighs: \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d is a nightmare for retail analysts with about a dozen Christmas trading announcements all coming out at once at 7am. But it\u2019s worth it, guys, to find out how Britain\u2019s high street and e-commerce sector fared during the first festive period since the Brexit vote. Also coming up.... There\u2019s not much in the economic calendar today, apart from a report on German GDP in 2016 at 9am, eurozone industrial production figures at 10am, and the weekly US jobless report at 1.30pm. Plus, traders will be watching to see if the FTSE 100 can extend its run of record highs....",

The think tank\u2019s John Higgins said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is tempting to attribute the FTSE 100\u2019s winning streak to a renewed plunge in sterling. But other factors have also been at play. These include higher commodity prices, the resilience of the UK economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit and spill-over effects from Trump\u2019s election victory. Looking ahead, we remain positive on the FTSE 100, but don\u2019t expect it to make much more headway.</p> <p>We doubt that there is much life left in the FTSE 100 rally.. Indeed, we forecast that it will end 2017 at 7,500, which is only about 3% above its level today. Granted, we expect the UK economy to continue to fare quite well. However, there are three reasons why we are cautious.</p> <p>First, we forecast a small gain in sterling in trade-weighted terms, as a further decline against the dollar (to $1.20/\u00a3 from $1.23/\u00a3) is more than offset by a rise against the euro (to \u20ac1.26/\u00a3 from \u20ac1.15/\u00a3). Second, we expect the rally in oil prices to peter out. Our end-year forecast for Brent crude is $60pb, which is not much above its price today (around $56pb). And third, we think the US stock market will run out of steam, as the enthusiasm with which shareholders greeted Trump\u2019s victory starts to wane and profit margins are squeezed. Our end-2017 forecast for the S&amp;P 500 is only 2,300, which is barely above its level now.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5877a0dde4b0f10ba20b7732\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-12T15:31:13.609Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Commenting on the market falls, Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After briefly sneaking into positive territory the FTSE slipped back into the red this afternoon, with the index\u2019s 2017 winning streak potentially about to come to an end.</p> <p>Despite a largely healthy set of commodity stocks, and a wave of positive Christmas updates from its key retailers, it seems like there was just too much going on for the FTSE this Thursday. The negative reaction to some of those trading statements, most notably Tesco and Primark-owner Associated British Foods, alongside the pound\u2019s rebound against the dollar, largely prompted by the greenback\u2019s own weaknesses, prevented the UK index from building beyond the 7300 it struck yesterday.</p> <p>Over in the US things took a rather sharp turn downwards, with the Dow Jones plunging by 150 points after the bell. It seems that both the Dow and the dollar are still displeased with the lack of policy detail in Donald Trump\u2019s press conference on Wednesday. Especially disgruntled are the US pharmaceutical stocks, the likes of Shire and Pfizer continuing yesterday\u2019s losses after the President-elect claimed that the sector was \u2018getting away with murder\u2019 in regards to drug prices. </p> <p>In the Eurozone, meanwhile, the DAX and CAC incurred some hefty losses as the euro hit a one month high against the dollar and took 0.3% off the pound.

The year 2017 will in our view look very much like 2016, only with a bit less of everything. Domestic demand, ie construction and both private and public consumption, should remain the main growth drivers. The biggest risk for the economy is not Trump or political populism in the Eurozone but self-complacency. The economy urgently needs new impetus from new structural reforms and stronger public and private investment. It is very unlikely that it will get any of these before the elections.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d7f42f4bc92d776774f2226b8a95a88bc58f717\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d7f42f4bc92d776774f2226b8a95a88bc58f717/0_174_5264_3160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Germany economy grows but imports outpace exports\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Germany economy grows but imports outpace exports</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthias Schrader/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>UniCredit economist Andreas Rees was also positive:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The German economy remains a stronghold of continuity. With plus 1.9% in 2016, its growth performance was rock solid and even accelerated to its strongest pace in the last five years (2015: +1.7%; 2014: +1.6%). Once again, the major driver was domestic demand in the form of private and public consumer expenditures and not export activity. Imports were even outpacing exports last year. Taking a glimpse into 2017, the German economy remains fundamentally in good shape. The growth drivers will change somewhat, since there will be a (moderate) shift from domestic demand to stronger export activity. What can go wrong? It goes without saying that there are substantial political risks, especially from the US, which could have an (indirect) impact on German exports. Whether and how this will play out still remains to be seen. For 2017, we expect \u201conly\u201d GDP growth of 1.5%. Please note that the reason for the drop is NOT based on fundamentals and definitely not a reason to be worried. Instead, the lower number of working days is artificially weighing on the headline growth number (calendar-day adjusted growth in 2017: +1.8% after also +1.8% last year). </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5877552fe4b0c0afac91ffd3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-12T10:21:38.833Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pharma shares hit by Trump comments</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking of Donald Trump, one market moving comment in his press conference related to pharmaceutical companies.</p> <p>He said drugs companies were \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d in the prices they charged and promised that would change. That sent US pharma stocks lower, and theat sentiment has carried over into Europe.</p> <p>So Shire, Hikma, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca have all seen their shares fall. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If pharmaceutical companies were hoping for an easier ride from President elect Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton they were quickly disabused of this notion last night when the President elect let rip at the industry\u2019s pricing policies.</p> <p>Last year was notable for a number of stories related to price gouging including the Mylan story around the Epipen price hikes, and Valeant\u2019s policy of buying older niche drugs and then hiking the prices aggressively, and the antipathy that resulted from these stories has made the industry an easy target for a President who may feel compelled to get some quick political wins. </p> <p>At a time when pharmaceutical companies were hoping for a more benign investment environment last night\u2019s remarks were a reminder, if any were needed, as well as a warning to the sector and other sectors as well, of the President elects propensity to adopt a scatter gun approach to domestic policy. </p> <p>Investors would do well to bear this in mind given that the recent stock market rally doesn\u2019t appear to have factored this into their investment scenarios. The Trump Presidency is unlikely to be a one way bet for stock markets. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dfbff958f9b7e1623740bfd082d98f5adc3a45c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dfbff958f9b7e1623740bfd082d98f5adc3a45c/0_193_4366_2620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mylan\u2019s EpiPen epinephrine auto-injector.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mylan\u2019s EpiPen epinephrine auto-injector.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Zaleski/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-12T10:37:22.631Z\">at 10.37am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5877568be4b0710de27b8bfa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-12T10:16:41.799Z\">10.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A stronger pound is also taking some of the shine off the leading index.</strong></p> <p>One of the driving factors behind the recent surge in the FTSE 100 to record levels has been the weakness of sterling, which benefits overseas earners and makes UK assets more attractive to international investors.</p> <p>But disappointment that president-elect Donald Trump - in his first press conference since July - failed to spell out details of his plans to boost the US economy with infrastructure spending and new tax measure has sent the dollar lower.</p> <p>Against the US currency the pound has added 0.32% to $1.2252, although sterling is virtually flat against the euro at \u20ac1.1528.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58775603e4b0f10ba20b7576\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-12T10:12:21.742Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FTSE 100 has slipped back after its record breaking run of ten consecutive closing highs, and is currently down 0.22% at 7274.</p> <p>Retailers have received a mixed reception to their Christmas updates, with Marks &amp; Spencer and JD Sports moving sharply higher, but Tesco, Primark owner Associated British Foods and AO World all disappointing investors.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58774e0ce4b0c0afac91ffab\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-12T09:40:52.760Z\">9.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Stockbrokers<strong> Shore Capital</strong> are extremely unamused that Tesco, M&amp;S, Debenhams, ASOS et al all decided to release their results today in a \u201cchaotic\u201d splurge.</p> <p>They say:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The British retail trade has decided to make many market updates today. </p> <p>Such dis-coordination, to put it politely, does not serve shareholders and investors well.

      "bodyText": "Almost 3,000 cabin crew from British Airways\u2019 mixed fleet branch at Heathrow will strike again next week in a row over what the union describes as poverty pay. The crew will walk out for three days from next Thursday, following a 48-hour strike this week that led to about 100 flights being cancelled or merged by BA. The union, Unite, says pay at the national carrier is so low that crew are taking second jobs or working while sick because they cannot afford to take a day off. With more crew having joined up since the dispute started, Unite called on BA to raise pay, which starts at \u00a312,192 basic, although the airline says most crew earn at least \u00a321,000 with flying allowances. Oliver Richardson, a national officer of the Unite union, said: \u201cBritish Airways should be under no illusion about our members\u2019 determination to secure a settlement that addresses their concerns over poverty pay.\u201d All new recruits to BA now join the mixed fleet, which was set up during the bitter industrial dispute of 2010-11 and work on long- and short-haul flights. BA said the strike action was \u201cbizarre and regrettable\u201d. The airline said the last strike had failed to disrupt operations and added: \u201cWe will again aim to ensure that all our customers travel to their destinations.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US Environmental Protection Agency has accused a second major car company, Fiat Chrysler, of cheating on its diesel emissions testing by using secret software applications in multiple models. The company\u2019s Jeep Cherokee and Dodge Ram vehicles used \u201cmanagement software\u201d that \u201cincreases air pollution\u201d from nitrogen oxides for three years, the EPA alleged in a notice of violation issued Thursday. Fiat Chrysler said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the citation, and it \u201cbelieves\u201d its emission control systems met applicable requirements. \u201cAll automakers must play by the same rules, and we will continue to hold companies accountable that gain an unfair and illegal competitive advantage,\u201d said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for EPA\u2019s office of enforcement and compliance assurance. Volkswagen was accused of using similar software on its own diesel vehicles to mask the emissions of the same greenhouse gas in September 2015. Multiple regulators slapped the automaker with $15bn in fines and consumers the world over filed class-action lawsuits against the firm. Shares of Fiat Chrysler immediately dropped 16% on the news. Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler, objected to comparisons of Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler, suggesting that conflating the two was evidence of a different kind of unlawful emission: Anyone who compares Fiat to VW \u201cis smoking illegal material,\u201d Marchionne told Reuters. The jibe is a favorite of Marchionne\u2019s, who accused Mormon former presidential candidate Mitt Romney of the same for objecting to the auto industry bailout. The software used by Fiat Chrysler lowered the emissions of nitrogen oxides during testing, the EPA alleges. \u201cBy failing to disclose this software and then selling vehicles that contained it, FCA [Fiat Chrysler Automobiles] violated important provisions of the Clean Air Act.\u201d The EPA said it had the authority to force Fiat Chrysler to recall the 2014, 2015 and 2016 Cherokee SUVs and Ram pickup trucks \u2013 some 104,000 automobiles \u2013 but that it had not yet decided to do so. \u201cAny follow-up action, including the need for a recall, will be determined as part of the ongoing investigation,\u201d spokespeople for the regulator wrote. In general, regulators offer manufacturers a chance to voluntarily recall their product before forcing a recall. Fiat Chrysler \u201cbelieves that its emission control systems meet the applicable requirements,\u201d the company said in a prepared statement. Fiat Chrysler did not address the EPA\u2019s allegations that the car company had hidden the software from the regulator, instead stating that lowering its cars\u2019 emissions during testing was necessary to \u201cbalance EPA\u2019s regulatory requirements for low nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and requirements for engine durability and performance, safety and fuel efficiency\u201d. Michelle Krebs, senior analyst with Autotrader, said: \u201cWe need to be careful not to jump to the conclusion that the Fiat Chrysler diesel situation is the same as the Volkswagen one. It is clear that the Volkswagen diesel debacle prompted regulators to more closely scrutinize all diesels and obviously they noticed some issues with Fiat Chrysler.\u201d The EPA is working in conjunction with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) on its citation of Fiat Chrysler. \u201cOnce again, a major automaker made the business decision to skirt the rules and got caught,\u201d said CARB chair Mary D Nichols. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 January 2017 because an earlier version referred to nitrous oxide. This has been corrected to say nitrogen oxides.",

    "webTitle": "Southern rail conductors' strike to compound drivers' walkout", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The RMT has called a fresh 24-hour strike by conductors on Southern trains to come immediately before three days of drivers\u2019 strikes, a move that underlines that the dispute, and commuter misery, is unlikely to end soon. Its members will strike on Monday 23 January and Aslef\u2019s drivers will start another round of strikes the following day. Drivers will stage their third day of strikes this week on Friday, halting virtually all of Southern\u2019s 2,242 scheduled daily services. Southern\u2019s trains were badly disrupted again on Thursday even without a strike, due to the knock-on effects of this week\u2019s action and an overtime ban. Although Southern\u2019s conductors have now been forced to accept new contracts rebranding them as onboard supervisors, the dispute over their role and responsibilities has continued. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, hit out at the chief executive of Southern\u2019s operating company, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), saying he had failed to honour a pledge to ensure trains had two members of staff onboard \u2013 one that he made again in a regional BBC TV debate with unions earlier this week. Cash said: \u201cCharles Horton has repeatedly promised publicly to retain a second safety-critical member of staff on his trains but, as soon as it comes to direct talks, the pledge melts away. That is the main reason why we are forced again to put on further strike action. \u201cIt is down to the company to end this posturing and to get back into the room with us to kickstart the negotiating process, which is what the public are clearly crying out for. \u201cRMT is available but it is down to GTR to show that same commitment and to stick to the promises they gave on camera in front of a TV audience across the region.\u201d A Southern spokesperson said Horton had spoken to the RMT\u2019s representative Mick Lynch immediately after the BBC debate to invite the union to fresh talks but had been given no dates or times, adding: \u201cWe remain ready to meet the RMT leadership, as we do Aslef, any time, any place, anywhere to find a way to end their disputes.\u201d The prospect of talks appears to have receded as relations between the train operator and unions worsen. GTR announced on Wednesday it was again pursuing legal action against Aslef to halt the strikes, going to the supreme court after losing a court case and an appeal last year. In December, the high court rejected GTR\u2019s argument that a strike would breach rights under EU law guaranteeing freedom of movement. Aslef described last month\u2019s legal action as a waste of money for taxpayers, shareholders and passengers. The union insisted it had genuine safety concerns over the further implementation of driver-only operation on Southern services, including the responsibility of drivers to close the train doors. The potential ramifications were highlighted this week when a driver appeared in court after a passenger was dragged along a station platform and injured after trapping her arm in a train door. However, rail industry bodies say that driver-only operation is safe, a position endorsed last week again in a report by the rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road. The row over driver-only operation could soon extend north, with the RMT having this week given ultimatums to both Arriva Rail North, which runs Northern, and Merseyrail to commit to keeping guards on trains or face industrial action. The union warned that the taxpayer would be liable for losses to train companies in the event of similar strikes, with the government having inserted clauses in new franchise agreements to allow firms to claim for lost revenue. The RMT estimated that the Southern contract meant the cost to the public purse in strikes was now \u00a360m in lost revenue. Cash said the clauses meant taxpayers would \u201cbankroll Theresa May\u2019s war on the unions\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The company which cut the weight of Toblerone bars by widening the gaps between the chocolate peaks is now slapping a 20% price rise on Cadbury\u2019s Freddo bars. The recommended retail price of the chocolate frogs, which weigh 18g (0.6oz), is scheduled to jump from 25p to 30p in the spring. The US food manufacturing giant Mondel\u0113z, which owns Cadbury, said it was having to make selective price increases as a \u201clast resort\u201d. The firm made a better than expected profit of $548m (\u00a3448m) in its last three-month financial period. Other Cadbury\u2019s chocolate bars are also expected to rise in price, but Mondel\u0113z declined to name the other affected brands or say if all prices would go up by 20%. Mondel\u0113z, which also makes Ritz crackers, Philadelphia cheese, Oreos and Milka chocolate, said price hikes were necessary. A spokeswoman said: \u201cIncreasing prices is always a last resort, but to ensure we can keep people\u2019s favourite brands on shelf and look after the 4,500 people we employ in the UK, we are having to make some selective price increases across our range.\u201d Economists have warned that inflation will rise in the coming months as a result of the decline in the value of the pound. Food manufacturers are either increasing prices or shrinking pack sizes \u2013 dubbed \u201cshrinkflation\u201d \u2013 as they look to maintain profit margins as input costs increase. Shrinkflation started during the last recession and in recent years chocolate lovers have been regularly targeted: Mars and Snickers bars have got smaller; 1kg tins of Quality Street and Roses have slimmed down to 820g; and six-packs of Cadbury\u2019s Creme Eggs \u2013 also a Mondel\u0113z brand \u2013 have been whittled down to five. Mondel\u0113z, which bought Cadbury in 2010, was widely criticised last year when it opted to widen the gaps between Toblerone\u2019s chunky chocolate triangles rather than increase its price. Rival Mars has also shrunk its sharing bags of Maltesers by 15% as it looks for ways to offset rising production costs. Mondel\u0113z said rising commodity costs and recent foreign exchange pressures meant its food products were becoming more expensive to make. The pound has fallen sharply against the dollar since the vote for Brexit last summer. The company highlighted the price of cocoa, which it imports into the UK, had risen over 50% since 2013. Earlier this week, Premier Foods, which makes Oxo cubes, Mr Kipling cakes, Bisto gravy and Homepride flour, said it was in talks with supermarkets over pushing up prices by about 5%. In the autumn Tesco had a public spat with Unilever over plans for price rises of up to 10% on brands such as Marmite. A spokeswoman for Mondel\u0113z said: \u201cWe have, and continue, to carry these increased costs within our business as much as possible, because our priority is to keep our brands as affordable as we can.\u201d She added: \u201cImportantly it is the retailer who ultimately sets the price on the shelf.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Before his appearance at transport questions in the Commons, Chris Grayling was last seen being pushed to the back of the queue at Clapham Junction railway station as he fought with other commuters to get into work during Monday\u2019s tube strike. You might have imagined the transport secretary would have rolled with the punches on that one: Failing Grayling has been demoted so often in his political career, as David Cameron and Theresa May have vainly searched for a job he can\u2019t do badly, that there should have been a certain familiarity to his predicament. Quite the opposite. Instead of acceptance, there was rage. The scars still throbbed as Grayling unburdened his heartache. Wisely choosing to focus on the three days of mayhem on Southern rail rather than the tube strike which was in large part a result of an unresolved dispute on Boris Johnson\u2019s watch as London mayor, Failing time and again spoke of the hardship that he and thousands of others had suffered \u2013 even going so far as to suggest he was considering legislation to limit further strikes. In Grayling\u2019s view, the strikes were entirely the responsibility of a lazy workforce who were merely using the pretext of safety as a disguise for having a few days off and making commuters\u2019 lives a misery. Never once did it appear to have crossed his mind that at least half the responsibility for the mess lay with Southern operator Govia \u2013 a company that most people wouldn\u2019t trust to run a Hornby model railway set safely and to time. No. Failing couldn\u2019t see further than his humiliation at Clapham Junction and was determined to lash out by making sure many more people would feel his pain. Starting with those to the south-east of London. Labour\u2019s Matthew Pennycock asked why the minister was so keen to repeat the mistakes of Southern in his proposed solution for the new Southeastern franchise. Failing was adamant he wasn\u2019t politicising the situation. It was just that he did not want a Labour mayor getting his fingers anywhere near his train set. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. \u201cHe has put party politics ahead of passengers and clearly prefers to see trains running late than running on time under Labour,\u201d he said. \u201cWill he now agree to an independent assessment of the proposal by a respected figure outside his department, given yesterday\u2019s revelations of conflicting commercial interests, to restore credibility to the process?\u201d The short answer was no. Not until McDonald condemned the strikes and told everyone to go back to work. Next, Failing wanted to move on to the triumph of HS2. You could feel some of the transport secretary\u2019s composure return at this point. No matter how badly he does his job, there\u2019s little chance of him still being in it by the time the first piece of track has been laid, let alone by the time it is up and running. Could he explain why the Adam Smith Institute had predicted the costs could rise to \u00a380bn with each mile of track costing nine times more than in France, asked the SNP\u2019s Margaret Ferrier. Easy. It was because we were nine times keener on protecting the environment. Where the French just left leurs h\u00e9rissons (their hedgehogs) to fend for themselves, we were giving all ours intensive therapy and brand-new starter homes. An admirable sentiment. But perhaps the money might have been better spent on the NHS. At which point, the Conservative Martin Vickers woke up, demanding to know why there were now only Saturday train services to Cleethorpes. Failing grinned. He had that covered. He wanted to see more overcrowded trains. Overcrowded trains were a sign of how popular rail travel had become under privatisation. Commuters ought to be thrilled to be squashed together like sardines. And the later trains ran, the better it would be as there would be more people on them. Go Govia. A few Labour MPs started shaking their heads. They were probably trying to work out why he had been so pissed off earlier in the week at his 45-minute delay.",

    "webTitle": "Never-before-heard Bernie Madoff tapes reveal details of ruinous Ponzi scheme", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bernard Madoff, the imprisoned confidence trickster, has laid the blame for his ruinous Ponzi scheme at the feet of banks and wealthy investors he claims didn\u2019t care whether his firm was legitimate or not in a series of never-before-heard recordings. The interviews, part of author Steve Fishman\u2019s new audio series, Ponzi Supernova, feature much of Madoff\u2019s characteristic refusal to take responsibility for paying his investors out of each other\u2019s pockets. Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities promised huge returns from canny investments but in reality paid investors with other early investors\u2019 cash. As the firm became more and more \u201csuccessful\u201d Madoff said the banks that at first shunned him were suddenly beating down his door: \u201cAll of a sudden these banks give you the time of day. They\u2019re willing to give you a billion dollars. I had all of these major banks coming down and entertaining me. It is a head trip,\u201d he tells Fishman. Madoff was found guilty of defrauding thousands of investors of billions of dollars on 29 June 2009. He was sentenced to 150 years in prison with restitution of $170bn and is serving his sentence at the Butner federal correctional complex in Durham, North Carolina. Fishman, who conducted three hours of interviews with Madoff personally, points out that while the fraudster ruined many lives, roughly half of Madoff\u2019s investors still ended up in the black. \u201cYeah, he was a criminal talent, with God-given gifts in a sense, but Madoff was Patient Zero,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cWhat really makes him a pandemic is all the feeder funds [who introduced new clients to Madoff] and the banks,\u201d Fishman told the Guardian. \u201cThey take him around the world. They recruit investors, in Latin America and through Europe, and they basically pour gasoline on this dumpster fire. Madoff could have been kind of a local swindler until he meets this massive distribution network.\u201d The forgeries committed on some clients\u2019 documents, Fishman said, were even done as if to order by some clients. According to ex-FBI agent Steve Garfinkel, Annette Bongiorno, Madoff\u2019s longtime assistant and first employee, would doctor statements on request. Clients would call to complain that Madoff promised 18% but they\u2019d gotten 16%. Bongiorno would respond with an amended statement showing the promised rate. Bongiorno began her own sentence of six years for her role in the scheme in 2014. While he will spend the rest of his life in jail, the 73-year-old Madoff is upbeat about his circumstances on the series, bragging about how his doors \u201care not locked at night\u201d. \u201cI have a pretty big picture window \u2013 you can\u2019t open it,\u201d he tells Fishman. But life behind bars has not always been easy. Other prisoners say Madoff didn\u2019t learn courtesy quickly enough \u2013 one interviewee recounts Madoff trying to change the television to a news report featuring his crimes while another inmate was watching something else. The other \u2013 much younger \u2013 man ended the dispute with \u201can open-hand slap\u201d. Madoff got away with it for so long, he and others tell Fishman, because the inexperienced US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulators chasing him didn\u2019t know what they were looking for, and because his operation stayed one step ahead of the regulator. In one anecdote, Madoff simply rifles through an inspector\u2019s briefcase until he finds that he\u2019s being pursued for \u201cfront-running\u201d \u2013 the practice of buying for yourself on advance information before you pass it on to investors. That seemed logical, Madoff admits, \u201cexcept it wasn\u2019t true, and it was illegal!\u201d Madoff orchestrated office-wide performances for the investigators who were sent to his offices to search for evidence of wrongdoing, former US attorney Matthew Schwartz tells Fishman. Because his investment returns were so big the regulators were suspicious, but they didn\u2019t know how or what was going on. When an investigator asked to see a report that a legitimate firm would have on hand in the course of its normal businesses, Madoff\u2019s second-in-command, Frank DiPascali, stalled for time while downstairs others printed out a faked report, put it in the refrigerator so it wouldn\u2019t be obviously warm from the printer, and \u201cplayed football with it\u201d, Schwartz says \u2013 tossing it back and forth across the room like a football to make it look weathered. Set dressing was also important: on the credenza behind his desk, Madoff displayed a sculpture by the renowned artist Claes Oldenburg of a giant black screw, listing a little to one side. The 1976 sculpture, called Soft Screw, drew nearly $50,000 at Sotheby\u2019s when Madoff\u2019s assets were sold off after his disgrace. When financial regulators visited his firm\u2019s offices, Madoff put the Soft Screw away.",

As the firm became more and more \u201csuccessful\u201d Madoff said the banks that at first shunned him were suddenly beating down his door: \u201cAll of a sudden these banks give you the time of day. They\u2019re willing to give you a billion dollars. I had all of these major banks coming down and entertaining me. It is a head trip,\u201d he tells Fishman.</p> <p>Madoff was found guilty of defrauding thousands of investors of billions of dollars on 29 June 2009. He was sentenced to 150 years in prison with restitution of $170bn and is serving his sentence at the Butner federal correctional complex in Durham, North Carolina. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Madoff got away with it for so long because inexperienced regulators chasing him didn\u2019t know what they were looking for</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/businessfinance/54703/\">Fishman</a>, who conducted three hours of interviews with Madoff personally, points out that while the fraudster ruined many lives, roughly half of Madoff\u2019s investors still <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-madoff-scam-meet-the-liquidator-25-09-2009/\">ended up in the black</a>. \u201cYeah, he was a criminal talent, with God-given gifts in a sense, but Madoff was Patient Zero,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cWhat really makes him a pandemic is all the feeder funds [who introduced new clients to Madoff] and the banks,\u201d Fishman told the Guardian. \u201cThey take him around the world. They recruit investors, in Latin America and through Europe, and they basically pour gasoline on this dumpster fire.

According to ex-FBI agent Steve Garfinkel, Annette Bongiorno, Madoff\u2019s longtime assistant and first employee, would doctor statements on request. Clients would call to complain that Madoff promised 18% but they\u2019d gotten 16%. Bongiorno would respond with an amended statement showing the promised rate. Bongiorno began her own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/madoff-secretary-six-years-prison-fraud\">sentence of six years</a> for her role in the scheme in 2014.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/dec/21/the-50-best-podcasts-of-2016\">The 50 best podcasts of 2016</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While he will spend the rest of his life in jail, the 73-year-old Madoff is upbeat about his circumstances on the series, bragging about how his doors \u201care not locked at night\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI have a pretty big picture window \u2013 you can\u2019t open it,\u201d he tells Fishman.</p> <p>But life behind bars has not always been easy.

The other \u2013 much younger \u2013 man ended the dispute with \u201can open-hand slap\u201d.</p> <p>Madoff got away with it for so long, he and others tell Fishman, because the inexperienced US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulators chasing him didn\u2019t know what they were looking for, and because his operation stayed one step ahead of the regulator. In one anecdote, Madoff simply rifles through an inspector\u2019s briefcase until he finds that he\u2019s being pursued for \u201cfront-running\u201d \u2013 the practice of buying for yourself on advance information before you pass it on to investors. </p> <p>That seemed logical, Madoff admits, \u201cexcept it wasn\u2019t true, and it was illegal!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Others printed out a faked report and put it in the refrigerator so it wouldn\u2019t be obviously warm from the printer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Madoff orchestrated office-wide performances for the investigators who were sent to his offices to search for evidence of wrongdoing, former US attorney Matthew Schwartz tells Fishman. Because his investment returns were so big the regulators were suspicious, but they didn\u2019t know how or what was going on. When an investigator asked to see a report that a legitimate firm would have on hand in the course of its normal businesses, Madoff\u2019s second-in-command, Frank DiPascali, stalled for time while downstairs others printed out a faked report, put it in the refrigerator so it wouldn\u2019t be obviously warm from the printer, and \u201cplayed football with it\u201d, Schwartz says \u2013 tossing it back and forth across the room like a football to make it look weathered.</p> <p>Set dressing was also important: on the credenza behind his desk, Madoff displayed a sculpture by the renowned artist Claes Oldenburg of a giant black screw, listing a little to one side. The 1976 sculpture, called Soft Screw, drew nearly <a href=\"http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/prints-n09138/lot.271.html\">$50,000 at Sotheby\u2019s</a> when Madoff\u2019s assets were sold off after his disgrace. </p> <p>When financial regulators visited his firm\u2019s offices, Madoff put the Soft Screw away.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "John Lewis has warned that its annual bonus for staff will be significantly lower than last year as it prepares to take a hit from the post-Brexit slump in sterling. Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the staff-owned group, which includes Waitrose, said he anticipated a \u201cchallenging\u201d year ahead as retailers would have to absorb a big chunk of the rising cost of importing goods just as they are coping with shoppers\u2019 shift to buying online. \u201cSterling, I think, is the dog that hasn\u2019t really barked,\u201d said Mayfield. He said a near-20% drop in the value of the pound had yet to affect most businesses because they had bought currency six months to a year in advance. But he warned that would now begin to unwind: \u201cMy view is quite a lot of [the increased costs] will be absorbed by retailers as we are in an increasingly competitive market place with excess of retail space. Even if it is passed on to customers it is not necessarily a good thing as it will dampen demand especially if we see a swing in inflation versus wage growth.\u201d Mayfield said the devaluation of sterling was \u201cone of the most significant factors overhanging the outlook for the year ahead.\u201d This will be the fourth consecutive year that the group, which is collectively owned by its staff, has reduced the payout, but it is highly unusual for it to cut the bonus when profits rise. Last year its 91,500 employees, known as partners, were awarded bonuses of 10% of salary, the lowest for 13 years, averaging just over \u00a31,500 each. The bonus payout started in 1920. It was suspended during the second world war and the early 1950s recession, and peaked at 24% of salary in the 1980s. The highest payout in recent years was 18% in 2011. Its decision to cut the payout comes despite a strong Christmas and expectations of higher profits for the year to the end of January, thanks to lower pension costs. Sales for the John Lewis department store business, including online, rose by 2.7% in the six weeks to 31 December as the group enjoyed strong trading in fashion and homewares. Online sales soared nearly 12% while store sales rose 0.8%, helped by the opening of two new outlets. The Waitrose chain also had a strong Christmas with sales at established stores up by 2.8% over the period, partly thanks to strong trading at the group\u2019s growing network of in-store cafes and restaurants. Sales of its premium Waitrose 1 range, which includes specialities such as Sicilian lemon meringue eclairs, rose more than 21%. Mayfield said: \u201cAlthough we expect to report profits up on last year, trading profit is under pressure. This reflects the greater changes taking place across the retail sector.\u201d The shift towards online sales hits profits because of the cost of home deliveries and returns. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said John Lewis\u2019s never knowingly undersold price-matching scheme was also likely to have cost the company profit margin as discounting across the market increased ahead of Christmas. Mayfield said the group would have to lift investment in product innovations, such as its premium Waitrose 1 food line or Modern Rarity fashion label, as well as developing infrastructure to cope with rising demand for online shopping. He said the group would also be investing more in its existing stores to ensure they could continue to attract shoppers. About 40% of John Lewis\u2019s sales were online over Christmas, up from 36% last year, and Mayfield said there was no sign of a slowdown in the pace of growth. He predicted that the department store, whose new boss Paula Nickolds takes the helm this month, was likely to book half its sales via the internet ahead of the 2020 deadline previously expected. Mayfield said that John Lewis\u2019s board had a responsibility to look at the long term rather than maintain the bonus for staff. \u201cWe have to strike a balance and we believe it is right to retain a bit more profit in order to invest in the future of the business,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco hopes to deliver better than expected annual profits after higher sales of food, clothes and toys in the UK resulted in a strong Christmas performance. Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, said the group had taken a \u201csignificant step on in the turnaround of the business\u201d as he revealed a slightly better than expected 0.7% rise in sales at established UK stores in the six weeks to 7 January. However, Tesco\u2019s shares dropped by 2.3%, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 in early morning trading, as the retailer\u2019s international performance disappointed. The company said underlying sales rose by just 0.7% in Europe in the three months to 26 November, hit by a heavily competitive environment in Poland. Sales in Asia were also well below expectations after a slowdown in Thailand following the death of the king. In the UK, Lewis said Tesco had improved customer service and ranges, helping to boost sales of party food by 24%, premium wine by 20% and Free From specialist allergy-free foods by 18%. Britain\u2019s biggest food retailer said it had achieved the sales growth despite deciding not to repeat last year\u2019s loyalty card promotion, which it said had hit performance by 0.8%. Sales of the group\u2019s F&amp;F clothing range rose 4.3%. Richard Lim, the chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, said Tesco\u2019s turnaround continued to gather momentum. \u201cIts laser-like focus on the core UK food business through deeper price investment and further asset disposals has halted the loss of market share against the smaller but faster growing discounters,\u201d he said. Unlike rival Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco said its growth was underpinned by strong food sales, which rose by 2% in the UK over the 19 weeks to 7 January despite price deflation of just under 1%, a slight slowdown from earlier in the year. Lewis said \u201cinflationary pressure is there in many categories.\u201d But he said Tesco would be \u201cworking shoulder to shoulder to mitigate the impact of the falling pound\u201d. He said it was on track to meet its promised target of \u00a31.2bn of operating profit this year \u201cand maybe slightly more\u201d, as the sales rise had been achieved alongside improvements in efficiency. Tesco won back market share in the UK for the first quarterly period in five years before Christmas as shoppers responded to price cuts and investment in customer service. Underlying sales in the UK rose by 1.8% \u2013 towards the top end of analysts\u2019 expectations of between 1.25% and 2% growth for the three months to 26 November. That was a step up in pace from the 0.9% rise reported for the three months to the end of August \u2013 the retailer\u2019s third quarter of growth in a row. It also came after a strong Christmas for Tesco last year. Almost all the leading listed supermarket groups have had a good festive season \u2013 Sainsbury\u2019s had a record Christmas week, reporting its first sales growth since March, while Morrisons reported its best Christmas performance in seven years, with sales up 2.9%. On Thursday, Waitrose reported that sales rose by 2.8% at established stores in the six weeks to 31 December boosted by 4.8% growth at its convenience stores. Performance was also enhanced by a 4.9% rise in sales at Waitrose\u2019s growing number of in-store cafes, restaurants, wine and snack bars. Asda, the UK\u2019s third biggest supermarket chain, is expected to have had a trickier trading period. Its performance will not become clear until its parent group, Walmart, reports next month.",

      "bodyText": "Next week will see protectionism take centre stage globally as the Davos elite gathers to vent about its rise, and the Twitter protectionist Donald Trump becomes US president. Yet there is a left, green alternative that could effectively challenge the rise of the extreme right, while giving voters hope for a better future. In my new book Progressive Protectionism: Taking Back Control, I detail why progressives should endorse the controlling of borders to people, capital, goods and services, but not as occurred in the 1930s, when governments attempted to protect domestic jobs while still wanting to compete and export globally at the expense of others. Progressive Protectionism, by contrast, aims to nurture and rebuild local economies in a way that permanently reduces the amount of international trade in goods, money and services and enables nation states to control the level of migration that their citizens desire. This approach can return a sense of optimism to the majority through championing policies geared to achieving more job security, a decrease in inequality and protection of the environment worldwide. Jeremy Corbyn could play a key role here. His first tremulous steps towards endorsing \u201cmanaged migration\u201d are, of course, welcome. However, his fantasy that the UK can prosper out of the EU and protect domestic industry ignores how vulnerable a go-it-alone UK will be. Big business will threaten relocation and investment strikes should the government have the temerity to try to significantly improve social, employment and environmental conditions. Instead Corbyn should use next month\u2019s London meeting of European socialist parties to discuss how all EU member states can cooperate to reverse the present political, social and economic instability that haunts the whole continent. This should prioritise the protection and rebuilding of local economies and so provide a positive answer to voters\u2019 concerns. To achieve this, a debate needs to be started about why Europe needs a progressive protectionism to replace the increasingly discredited Treaty of Rome with a \u201cTreaty of Home Europe-wide\u201d. Cross-border issues such as responding to non-European migration, climate change, pollution, crime and military security would still of course require intra-European cooperation. This might sound far fetched, but such an approach by Europe\u2019s left would belatedly allow them to play catch up with the extreme right and Trump. The latter at present has the political monopoly on policies for curbing high migration and protecting local jobs from imports. Given the key elections looming this year in the Netherlands, France and Germany, addressing immigration and insecurity is something the left will have no choice but to do anyway. For this huge transition towards the protection of local economies to be achieved would also need a large scale, coordinated campaign by those who will eventually benefit from such changes. This will involve the constant reiteration of how the \u201cTreaty of Home\u201d will benefit domestic economic activity and services as compared with the present adverse effects of the four so called freedoms. These have included foreign steel and other imports hurting manufacturing, overseas companies snapping up domestic ones, foreign landlords leaving investment homes empty, the gig economy increasing job insecurity and inadequately controlled immigration growing alarmingly. Under pressure from angry, disadvantaged citizens and extreme right parties, European Governments of every political hue are increasingly being forced to take border controls seriously. Those of us who last June voted for remain, but to reform Europe, were frequently told that the political elite would never change direction. However as the complexity, long timetable and costs of Brexit become clearer, once controlling the free movement of people across Europe is on the table, then a second referendum, or a parliamentary vote on the Brexit on offer, could lead to a very different result. It could unite the huge numbers of remainers and Brexiters who want both controls on immigration and a mutually beneficial relationship with our European neighbours. Huge changes are coming in 2017. The successes achieved by Trump and Nigel Farage, the gains expected for Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders, and the crumbling lead of Angela Merkel will make those who still claim that globalisation and large scale immigration are irreversible appear as quaintly pass\u00e9 as those who once asserted that the sun would never set on the empire.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has reported its first increase in clothing sales at Christmas for six years after slashing prices and focusing on \u201cclassy\u201d rather than trendsetting fashion. M&amp;S said glamorous adverts featuring Janet McTeer as a Per Una clad \u201cMrs Claus\u201d had appealed to shoppers who snapped up its cashmere jumpers, thermals and lingerie. \u201cMrs Claus was fabulous,\u201d said M&amp;S chief executive, Steve Rowe. \u201cThe clothes she wore really resonated with customers. We have been listening to them very carefully and making sure our merchandise is appropriate.\u201d Rowe, who began his retail career aged 15 as a Saturday boy at M&amp;S\u2019s Croydon store in south London and took over as chief executive last April, is seeking to revive the declining profits of the 132-year-old retailer. His biggest job is turning around its clothing arm which under predecessor Marc Bolland relied on heavy discounting to attract shoppers. Analysts said the strong Christmas figures, which were better than expected, were a start. Clothing and homeware sales at stores open more than one year rose 0.8% in the 13 weeks to 31 December, once adjusted for a change in the reporting calendar. By the same measure like-for-like sales at its food arm rose 0.3%, buoyed by sales of upmarket treats such as chocolate mousse pine cones and cr\u00e8me brulee liqueur. Since taking over Rowe has cut the price of 2,000 clothing lines \u2013 rather than run constant promotions \u2013 and promised to pay more attention to its most loyal group of shoppers: the fiftysomething women he once described as \u201cMrs M&amp;S\u201d. It has also spent \u00a320m hiring extra staff to improve customer service. Disastrous Christmas sales figures from rival Next had rocked confidence in the retail sector and fuelled fears that Christmas 2016 had been a washout. But on what has been dubbed \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d, a slew of major high-street retailers including John Lewis, Tesco and Primark reported strong sales as Britons loosened their purse strings. \u201cI think the Mrs Claus advertising was very good,\u201d said Maureen Hinton, analyst at retail consultancy Verdict. \u201cShe looked very classy but was of a certain age group, with an authority about her. Overall it was glamorous and inspiring and made you recalibrate your view of M&amp;S and think, \u2018I better have another look.\u2019 I\u2019m still not convinced M&amp;S has got the look of its clothing consistently right but it is on the right path.\u201d While the upset at Next capped a long period of financial outperformance, M&amp;S\u2019s progress follows five years of dire figures, with clothing sales down by nearly 6% at Christmas in 2014 and 2015. Rowe said the improvement did not mean it would reverse last year\u2019s decision to shut 30 UK stores and convert 45 more into food-only shops \u2013 a move that will slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to its clothing ranges in favour of its food business. \u201cI\u2019m not hailing the recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is much more work to do.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Rex Tillerson\u2019s appointment as Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state has paved the way for a new round of US-Russia energy talks that could open up investment in oil and gas, according to a former Russian energy minister. Igor Yusufov, who served during Vladimir Putin\u2019s first term and is a former Gazprom board director, said the former ExxonMobil chief executive\u2019s \u201cbusiness-like manner\u201d and America\u2019s changing political climate had created hopes for a revival of bilateral energy summits that last took place more than a decade ago. ExxonMobil has huge oil assets in the Russian Arctic but is barred from exploring them by sanctions, and would be the main beneficiary of any thawing in relations. Tillerson told a confirmation hearing on Wednesday that sanctions harmed US businesses, but said he had personally never lobbied against sanctions despite reports saying ExxonMobil did so under his leadership. Tillerson was involved in US-Russia energy summits in 2002 and 2003, where he met Yusufov, who now runs a $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) Russian oil and gas fund, Fund Energy. There is mention of the possibility of future US-Russia energy talks in a dossier published by BuzzFeed on Wednesday on Trump\u2019s alleged close ties with Russia. In a claim the Guardian is unable to verify, the dossier says a Putin associate, Igor Sechin, met Trump adviser Carter Page in Moscow and raised with him the prospect of \u201cfuture bilateral energy cooperation\u201d. Page \u2013 an oil industry consultant \u2013 is claimed to have reacted positively but to have been noncommittal in response. Page, however, has said that while he did he did visit Moscow, he did not meet Sechin. Yusufov told the Guardian Trump\u2019s success had \u201cevoked hopes\u201d that energy dialogues between the US and Russia could be revived. \u201cRussia possesses both political and economical will to resuscitate this important international interaction format, possibly convoking the third energy summit with participation of leading ministries and private companies,\u201d he said. The 2002 and 2003 energy summits sprang out of meetings between George W Bush and Putin, and were seen by the US as a chance to identify new opportunities for investment in Russia. Yusufov said a third summit could generate investments and help drive up the price of oil, which has rallied after an Opec deal last year to curb production that included Russia. \u201c[It would bring] stability to the global oil market, which means a just price for crude oil,\u201d he said. \u201cIn their turn, these relations of global partnership can lead to a reasonable exchange of both investments and technologies.\u201d Anything that pushes up the oil price is in Russia\u2019s strategic interests, as the low price over the last two years has severely strained the country\u2019s budget and seen living standards for ordinary Russians decline. ExxonMobil has said that when and if sanctions are lifted, the company would return to its joint venture with Rosneft in Arctic waters, where it holds oil licences spanning 600,000 sq km (230,000 sq miles). In 2014, Exxon suspended cooperation with Rosneft after Russian intervention in Ukraine. Observers said that even if Yusufov was not speaking on behalf of the Russian government, he was advocating an agenda that served the Kremlin\u2019s interest. \u201cIt might just be one of his personal initiatives that are not really backed, but the other side of story is he has certain connections to people in power,\u201d said Vladimir Milov, a Russian opposition politician at the Institute of Energy Policy, a Moscow-based thinktank. Milov, who was deputy minister to Yusufov in 2002, said: \u201cHere, a lot of people are hoping for some reopening of relations with US and potential involvement of Americans in certain projects \u2013 the energy industry in the first place. \u201cThey want to unfreeze the projects with Exxon and I assume there\u2019s mutual interest from big corporations in the US.\u201d This week US thinktank the Center for American Progress said it expected the Trump administration to change US policies to aid ExxonMobil\u2019s interests in Russia. \u201cAs secretary of state, Tillerson could presumably align state department policy in the Middle East, China, Russia and elsewhere with the financial interests of Exxon,\u201d it said in a report. \u201cAt no time in recent US history has one company been at the brink of attaining so much power and influence over US policy, both domestic and foreign.\u201d A Kremlin spokesman on Wednesday said Russia stood by its assessment of Tillerson as someone who was constructive but tough. \u201cWe understand that Tillerson will continue to be quite tough in pursuing his line,\u201d said Dmitry Peskov, Putin\u2019s press secretary.",

      "bodyText": "Netflix is poised to launch its take on Lemony Snicket\u2019s dark children\u2019s tale A Series of Unfortunate Events, targeting the family drama audience traditionally catered for by ITV and the BBC. With The Voice and Gary Barlow-led Let It Shine battling it out on traditional TV on Saturday night, Netflix\u2019s big budget family series, based on the bestselling children\u2019s novels and starring How I Met Your Mother\u2019s Neil Patrick Harris, enters the fray on Friday. For Netflix the show forms part of a plan to woo audiences and add to its 90 million global subscribers, providing new opportunities for TV producers. About 20% of Netflix\u2019s $6bn (\u00a34.9bn) annual programming budget will be spent on original productions this year, according to analyst estimates, with a major focus on making shows with a \u201cmultigenerational appeal\u201d. \u201cThese new players have a big vision and are commissioning high quality shows with big writers and big casts,\u201d says Jane Turton, chief executive of All3Media, maker of Midsomer Murders, Shameless and Skins. \u201cTheir plans are ambitious, creatively and commercially. It\u2019s been a very good thing for content producers with commissioning revenues coming into the sector, especially in drama and now in factual, factual entertainment, and entertainment too.\u201d All3Media owns Lime Pictures, the Liverpool-based producer of Hollyoaks and The Only Way Is Essex, which is making a Netflix drama series about an American teenager\u2019s coming-of-age adventures during a stay at a British riding stables. This year Netflix will also make its first British children\u2019s programmes with an adaptation of Jill Murphy\u2019s The Worst Witch series of books for pre-teens. The challenge for traditional broadcasters, still smarting after recording the lowest-ever Christmas Day TV ratings on record, is stark. \u201cThe growth of traditional broadcaster\u2019s catch-up TV services has not offset the decline in people watching the night a show first airs,\u201d says Richard Broughton, a director at Ampere Analysis. \u201cThere are a variety of factors for the decline in TV viewing and one of those is services like Netflix. We estimate it attracts about as much viewing as Channel 5. It is fair to say they are taking some viewing.\u201d Netflix, which has a total TV content budget almost double that of the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 combined, will be making 1,000 hours of its own programming this year, a 66% rise on the 600 hours made in 2016. Amazon, which is estimated to have spent $3.2bn on content in 2016, also plans to double spending on video content and triple spending on original productions this year, increasing the competitive pressure on broadcasters. \u201cThe competition is getting hotter and there is a new world order,\u201d says one senior TV industry executive. Netflix has built its business and reputation on drama series with adult themes, such as House of Cards and Orange is The New Black, but now it must branch out to new genres to broaden its appeal and continue to add to its 90 million global subscribers. \u201cFamily and kids shows are the next front,\u201d says Broughton \u201cNow Netflix is available globally quick growth can\u2019t be got by launching in new territories. Netflix is looking to tap into those slightly more reluctant streaming groups for growth, and family viewing is a segment it has not addressed to the full extent.\u201d Netflix has been spurred on by the success of shows such as Stranger Things, the family-friendly 80s-themed sci-fi horror hit, which it says \u201coffered variety to families and content that doesn\u2019t pander to the younger generation\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t see a lot of premium shows made for both adults and kids,\u201d said Brian Wright, vice president of original series at Netflix. \u201cThere [are] very few series made with a high production value for enjoyment by a broader audience, that includes families. \u201cWhen we decided to diversify our programming slate, it was very clear to us that the movie industry does a great job here. Take examples such as Star Wars, Pixar, and the Harry Potter franchise. These movies are all aimed at equal enjoyment whether you\u2019re 10, 40 or 60 years old.\u201d Wright highlighted the start on production of Lost In Space, a remake of the 1960s family survival story, later this month as another example of targeting the family audience. The show will premiere next year. TV content spend Netflix: $6bn (\u00a34.9bn), about $1.2bn (\u00a31bn) on original shows, according to analyst estimates. Amazon: $3.2bn (\u00a32.6bn), originals spend unknown BBC: \u00a31.7bn across all TV channels, just \u00a367m spent acquiring shows (ie: non-original commissions) last year ITV: \u00a31bn across all TV channels, 89% of shows on ITV1 are original productions Channel 4: \u00a3629m across all TV channels, with \u00a3455m on original productions \u2022 This article was amended on 13 January 2017 to clarify that figures given for Netflix spending on original productions are according to analyst estimates.",

It is fair to say they are taking some viewing.\u201d</p> <p>Netflix, which has a total TV content budget almost double that of the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 combined, will be making 1,000 hours of its own programming this year, a 66% rise on the 600 hours made in 2016.</p> <p>Amazon, which is estimated to have spent $3.2bn on content in 2016, also plans to double spending on video content and triple spending on original productions this year, increasing the competitive pressure on broadcasters.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe competition is getting hotter and there is a new world order,\u201d says one senior TV industry executive. </p> <p>Netflix has built its business and reputation on drama series with adult themes, such as House of Cards and Orange is The New Black, but now it must branch out to new genres to broaden its appeal and continue to add to its 90 million global subscribers.</p> <p>\u201cFamily and kids shows are the next front,\u201d says Broughton \u201cNow Netflix is available globally quick growth can\u2019t be got by launching in new territories. Netflix is looking to tap into those slightly more reluctant streaming groups for growth, and family viewing is a segment it has not addressed to the full extent.\u201d</p> <p>Netflix has been spurred on by the success of shows such as Stranger Things, the family-friendly 80s-themed sci-fi horror hit, which it says \u201coffered variety to families and content that doesn\u2019t pander to the younger generation\u201d. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t see a lot of premium shows made for both adults and kids,\u201d said Brian Wright, vice president of original series at Netflix. \u201cThere [are] very few series made with a high production value for enjoyment by a broader audience, that includes families. </p> <p>\u201cWhen we decided to diversify our programming slate, it was very clear to us that the movie industry does a great job here. Take examples such as Star Wars, Pixar, and the Harry Potter franchise. These movies are all aimed at equal enjoyment whether you\u2019re 10, 40 or 60 years old.\u201d</p> <p>Wright highlighted the start on production of Lost In Space, a remake of the 1960s family survival story, later this month as another example of targeting the family audience. The show will premiere next year.</p> <p><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9d31365395667b41f7f2d15cc123c74a3371ddb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9d31365395667b41f7f2d15cc123c74a3371ddb/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Crown/Netflix\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Crown, Netflix\u2019s move into costume drama territory previously occupied by BBC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Bailey/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>TV content spend</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Netflix</strong>: $6bn (\u00a34.9bn), about $1.2bn (\u00a31bn) on original shows, according to analyst estimates.<br></p> <p><strong>Amazon</strong>: $3.2bn (\u00a32.6bn), originals spend unknown</p> <p><strong>BBC</strong>: \u00a31.7bn across all TV channels, just \u00a367m spent acquiring shows (ie: non-original commissions) last year</p> <p><strong>ITV</strong>: \u00a31bn across all TV channels, 89% of shows on ITV1 are original productions</p> <p><strong>Channel 4</strong>: \u00a3629m across all TV channels, with \u00a3455m on original productions</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 January 2017 to clarify that figures given for Netflix spending on original productions are according to analyst estimates.</p>",
