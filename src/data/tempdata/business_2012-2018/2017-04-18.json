The late Sir Richard George, the businessman who built Weetabix as a family company before selling it to a private equity firm in 2003, understood he was selling a product with limited international appeal. \u201cMothers tend to wean their children on Weetabix and people in Britain tend to grow up with an in-built liking for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case in other countries \u2013 it\u2019s very hard to sell them in Germany for instance.\u201d The Chinese attempt to disprove this theory has, to nobody\u2019s great surprise, ended in failure. The Weetabix that Chinese state-backed Bright Food group is selling looks very like the business it bought in 2012: 75% of revenues are in the UK and the 20% that comes from North America is mainly generated from products with a US heritage.

      "bodyText": "PS: Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s market reaction to the snap election: London traders are catching their breaths after the most volatile day for some months. So here\u2019s a closing summary. The British pound has soared to its highest levels of the year after Theresa May stunned Westminster, and the City, by calling for a general election on June 8th. Sterling has gained two cents against the US dollar, and is also up against the euro tonight. The strength of sterling helped to wipe more than \u00a345bn off the value of companies on the FTSE 100. The blue-chip index closed down 180 points, due to the strong pound hitting the value of overseas earnings, plus a fall in commodity prices. Some analysts have predicted that a large Tory win would make a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 more likely. Others have argued that it would allow May to resist pressure from hard-line eurosceptic MPs, and cut a more moderate deal with Europe. Economists also argue that the election raises the chances of a \u2018transitional deal\u2019 after 2019 (when Brexit should have happened), as the next government won\u2019t need to hold another election until 2022. City firms have been racing to revise their forecasts. Deutsche Bank was forced to rip up its bets against the pound, and promised to release new forecasts soon. There are also concerns that the election could hurt the UK economy, if it deters firms from committing to fresh investment. But in brighter news, the International Monetary Fund has revised up its forecast for UK growth this year - from 1.5% to a punchy 2%. That\u2019s all for tonight. Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the latest developments this evening. GW Swiss bank UBS has just fired over a research note on the snap general election. They predict that the pound will rally against the US dollar over the next year, to around $1.36, and that shares will also rally over the next six months. Here\u2019s the key points: The election is likely to have a limited economic impact We continue to expect the pound to close some of its valuation discount to other major currencies in the months ahead Our sense is that May will use this election as an opportunity to dampen the influence of those in the Conservative party who favour the hardest form of Brexit (a World Trade Organization-type arrangement) May\u2019s presumptive plan, if it proceeds as she intended, could support the economic outlook. It is unlikely to suffice to ward off the headwinds that falling real incomes and sliding business confidence will have on growth in the short term, yet it does reinforce our view that the economy will stage a recovery in the medium term We still target GBPUSD at $1.36 in the next 12 months We see a recovery in the 10-year gilt yield to 1.50% over the next 12 months We retain our six-month FTSE 100 forecast of 7550 After a highly volatile day, the pound is sitting proudly at its highest level since last December. Sterling is currently up two cents against the US dollar at $1.276, and up one euro cent at \u20ac1.191. They\u2019re both the highest levels in four months. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the currency markets have \u201croared their approval\u201d for a snap UK election. That has a predictable impact on the FTSE 100 - which earns around 70% of its revenues from overseas, rather than in sterling. Khalaf explains: The fall in the stock market is not a negative response to the UK election per se, rather it is a knock on effect of a surging pound, combined with price falls in some key commodity markets, all of which has taken its toll on the heavyweights of the FTSE 100 index. As we\u2019ve covered earlier, many economists have predicted that the poll on June 8 will strengthen Theresa May\u2019s hand in her EU negotiations. The risk of a \u2018cliff-edge\u2019 crisis, in which MPs reject the final Brexit deal, is perceived to have fallen. Some experts are arguing that May could rein in hard-line eurosceptic MPs, if she get a robust majority. David Owen of stockbrokers Jefferies explains: With the Labour party in disarray and polling (in a poll of polls) around 15 points behind the Conservatives, and the Lib Dems still facing an uphill struggle to win a lot more seats, the 8th June will likely see Theresa May elected with a larger majority. This will not just put her in a much stronger positon when negotiating with Brussels, but also should mean that the influence of some of her own hard-Brexit backbenchers may be significantly diluted. By my reckoning, today\u2019s slump has wiped off around \u00a346bn from the combined value of the 100 companies in the FTSE 100 index. Ouch! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has suffered its biggest one-day fall since the aftermath of the EU referendum last June. The blue-chip index has ended the day down 180 points, or 2.46%, at 7147 points. That takes the FTSE 100 down to its lowest level since February 2nd, and means it\u2019s barely registered any gains in 2017. Mining companies suffered the biggest losses, with BHP Billiton, Glencore and Anglo American all down over 5%. Like other internationally-focused firms, their overseas earnings are worth less in sterling terms when the pound rallies. Miners also suffered from the fall in the price of Chinese iron ore - a potential sign of slowing demand. Joshua Mahoney of IG explains: Incredibly, on a day where the UK stocks are suffering so heavily, it is not the announcement of a general election which has caused the biggest losers, but instead the falling price of iron ore, which has dragged the likes of BHP Billiton, Anglo American and Glencore to the bottom of the pile. Media Eghbal, Head of Countries\u2019 Analysis at Euromonitor International, is worried that the election will hurt the UK economy. She says: Weeks of campaigning leading up to the June election will add further uncertainty to an already highly ambiguous UK outlook. This will weigh on confidence and encourage investors to continue to hold off investment decisions until after the elections so it may well be now that we will start to see a slowing of economic growth. Euromonitor forecasts that UK real GDP growth will slow from Q2 2017 onwards to reach 0.8% annually by Q4 2017 compared to 2.0% a year earlier. With elections due in 2017 in Europe\u2019s three largest economies of Germany, France and now the UK (contributing 43.1% of European GDP in 2016), volatility in Europe is only set to get worse.\u201d A general election means new manifesto promises from the UK\u2019s political parties. And that could mean that existing pledges on, say, pensions and national insurance rates are ditched. Steven Cameron, Pensions Director at Aegon, says this include could the famous \u2018triple-lock\u2019 (which guarantees that pensions rise by average wages, inflation, or 2.5%, whichever is higher): He writes: \u201cWhile Brexit related matters will clearly dominate June\u2019s General Election, Political Party Manifestos could reopen other contentious issues including pensions, savings, taxation and the changing nature of employment. This could include the future of the state pension triple lock, which had looked safe until 2020, the shelved increases in self-employed National Insurance and the unfortunate \u2018will they, wont they\u2019 debate on pensions tax relief reform. Whilst revisiting these policy areas may not be a vote-winner amongst pensioners, higher rate tax payers, or the self-employed, the opportunity exists for all parties to set out their stall on these key issues, creating much needed longer term stability. Cameron predicts that rising prices could even become an election issue: \u201cWe may also see a new set of economic concerns rising in voters\u2019 minds. For example, pensioners on fixed incomes are particularly affected by the ongoing uptick in inflation we\u2019ve seen since the decision to leave the EU. Some older voters may start asking questions about each of the parties\u2019 plans to ensure it doesn\u2019t surge much beyond current levels.\u201d Financial journalist Paul Lewis also flags up the potential threat to the triple lock: With 30 minutes until the close of trading, the FTSE 100 is firmly on track for its worst day since last June. The blue-chip index is down 2.3%, or 168 points, at 7159, as the surging pound eats into the value of multinational firms in London. Sterling continues to get a boost from the general election decision - it\u2019s now up two cents at $1.276, the highest level this year. Over in parliament, chancellor Philip Hammond has hailed the surge in the pound\u2019s value today. He told MPs that the government doesn\u2019t have a view on the appropriate value of sterling -- that\u2019s a matter for the markets. But in the next breath, Hammond tells a Labour member that he\u2019s surely \u201cdelighted\u201d that the pound has risen today. He says: (The) prime minister\u2019s statement this morning has sent sterling up in the markets, demonstrating the confidence that the markets have in a future, for this country, under a Tory government with a new mandate.\u201d A glance at historic opinion polls shows why the City expects Theresa May to romp home in June.... Most City economists and investors seem convinced that Theresa May is going to win the general election by some distance (as do the bookmakers, to be fair). Here\u2019s Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, explaining the market reaction: \u201cWith Brexit negotiations on the cards, the Prime Minister has sought to strengthen her hand by calling a General Election. A successful election in June would likely provide May with a larger majority, one that would ease the process of agreeing terms of negotiation in Westminster. As we have seen across the Atlantic, a divided party can cause delays in driving policy change \u2013 delays the Prime Minister simply does not have time for, so this move to consolidate her power is wise, especially as recent polls show the Conservatives leading by more than 20 points ahead of Labour. Much depends on the Conservative manifesto \u2013 but the election campaign is unlikely to upset the markets. Unless we see a political upset, a greater source of clarity and confidence will be welcomed by investors as Brexit discussions get underway in earnest.\u201d The International Monetary Fund has just got Theresa May\u2019s election campaign off to a good start, by hiking their UK growth forecasts. The IMF now expects Britain\u2019s GDP to expand by 2% this year, up from 1.5% back in January and just 1.,1% last year, outperforming almost every other advanced economy. The Fund has also raised its forecasts for global growth this year, from 3.4% to 3.5%, and attacked the protectionist policies championed by Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, says: \u201cThe global economy seems to be gaining momentum \u2013 we could be at a turning point. \u201cBut even as things look up, the post\u2013world war two system of international economic relations is under severe strain despite the aggregate benefits it has delivered \u2013 and precisely because growth and the resulting economic adjustments have too often entailed unequal rewards and costs within countries.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: Share prices in London are suffering further losses. The FTSE 100 is now down 151 points, or 2%, at 7175, putting it firmly on track for its worst one-day performance since the Brexit vote. As mentioned earlier, that\u2019s mainly because the rallying pound hits the value of multinational companies listed in the City. But....the smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized UK focused firms, is also in the red. It\u2019s lost 227 points, or 1.1%, taking it down to 19294 points. Every sector of the FTSE 100 is in the red, with mining companies suffering the biggest losses. Deutsche Bank has declared that the general election is a \u201cgame-changer\u201d for the pound, forcing it to tear up its forecasts. Deutsche had been one of the most bearish voices in the City about sterling. Last month, it predicted that the pound would fall further as Brexit negotiations began. Not any more.... Breaking! The pound has now hit its highest level against the US dollar since last December. Sterling has extended its gains, and is now up 1.6 cents at $1.2729 - a four month high. Investors remain pretty confident that the election will deliver a decisive results, says Trevor Greetham, Head of Multi Asset at Royal London Asset Management: \u201cSterling has taken the news of a snap general election positively, as while it means increased political uncertainty in the near term, it probably means less uncertainty in the longer term. He\u2019s also not worried that the general election campaign will eat into the two-year window to negotiate Brexit. \u201cIf Theresa May gets a significantly increased mandate it will strengthen the UK\u2019s position in Brexit negotiations. In any case, while the UK may be distracted for the next few weeks of political uncertainty, there probably isn\u2019t much benefit in the UK engaging with French and German governments on Brexit ahead of their own elections.\u201d By calling a June election, Theresa May is effectively getting an extra two years to steer Britain through Brexit, as the next election needn\u2019t come until 2022. So argues Neil Williams, Chief Economist at Hermes Investment Management: The PM\u2019s call today to bring forward the election to 8 June looks both a way of consolidating her political position and tacit recognition that completing onerous Brexit negotiations will take longer than the two years hoped for by triggering Article 50. Holding the election this June instead of by May 2020 effectively offers her an extra two years to strike a deal before having to go to the nation again. But even this may not be long enough to address all the issues, he adds: I fear our negotiations could take many years to potentially end up back close to square one in terms of striking Mrs May\u2019s preferred \u201cbold and ambitious free trade agreement\u201d. This suggests she will negotiate to maintain access to - but no longer full membership of - a tariff-free system (akin to Canada\u2019s deal), and/or a customs union (similar to Turkey\u2019s). Even this will need time. First, the deal when struck will need Parliamentary approval, and then be subject to a \u2018phasing in\u2019 period (Mr Hammond has suggested two years) to allow firms, consumers and officials to adjust to the new arrangements. A second independence referendum in pro-EU Scotland, though not precluding Brexit, would also have provided an extra hurdle to completing it before the previous election deadline of May 2020. Second, the UK is relying on a cooperative sign-off by its 27 EU peers. The only real precedent we have is Greenland\u2019s exit in 1985. This was a \u2018soft\u2019 exit, but it took three years. We, larger and 44 years entwined in the EU, will need longer. The pound is on the brink of hitting $1.27, up over one cent today. Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief strategist at City firm ActivTrades, says the market is confident that Theresa Ma will win a larger majority on 8 June. \u201cMarkets tend to like a stronger government \u2013 they are predicting one in the UK due to the apparent weaker situation Labour is in \u2013 and we have seen in Turkey what a similar situation can do for the currency. Despite today\u2019s rally, the pound is still worth 15% less against the US dollar than before the EU referendum: The poll on June 8 will be a \u201cBrexit referendum\u201d, says Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group, an analyst firm. Rahman expects Theresa May will win a substantial majority, which will prevent pro-EU MPs from pushing for a \u2018soft Brexit\u2019 (eg, with membership of the single market). Instead, the PM will have a mandate to get a deal, making a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 much more likely, he argues: Unity is the Tories\u2019 secret weapon. Pro-EU Tory MPs will not defy May\u2019s line during the election. They are therefore much less likely to fight for soft Brexit once she has won a mandate. The Lords, however, will still have a soft Brexit majority. Peers will still apply pressure to May but without backing in the Commons the unelected second chamber will be powerless to halt a hard Brexit. An election will therefore strengthen May\u2019s hand in the Brexit negotiations. The EU27 would arguably also have to treat her with more respect\u2014not someone who, as Nicola Sturgeon recently reminded May, had never won an election as leader. May wants an EU deal. The extra freedom that an election win would give her will also give her more room to make the concessions she has recently signalled\u2014on the divorce bill; and freedom of movement and the ECJ\u2019s remit during a transitional period. It will be much more difficult for hardline Brexiteer Tories to oppose these concessions if the PM has won a personal mandate. A Conservative victory in the general election is almost a racing certainty, according to the bookies. The odds on a Conservative outright majority are 1/5, said Ladbrokes, with Labour\u2019s chance of winning the most seats put at just 7/1, with even longer odds, 12/1, for obtaining a majority. That said, the same bookies were giving odds of 10/1 on an outright Conservative majority in the days before Cameron\u2019s surprise victory in 2015. Lib Dem hopes of a huge anti-Brexit surge in support are slim, judged by the odds. Boyle Sports reckons the party has just a 25/1 chance of winning the most seats in the House of Commons, with UKIP priced at 50/1 whilst the Green party are the 200/1 outsiders. But you can get 5/1 on their being no overall majority. It\u2019s now also a 1/5 shot Jeremy Corbyn is replaced as leader of the Labour party before the end of 2017. Meanwhile, Boyle Sports will give you 33/1 on Britain changing its mind on Brexit and rejoining the EU before the start of 2025. Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: \u201cMay\u2019s change of heart has caught everyone by surprise, but it\u2019s looking hard to see Labour springing their own on June 8th with the Tories long odds-on for victory.\u201d The FTSE 100 is extending its losses, and now down 130 points or 1.7% at 7197. That\u2019s means we\u2019re on track for the biggest one-day selloff since the Brexit vote, as the Telegraph\u2019s Tara Cunningham tweets: City experts are in broad agreement that Theresa May will win a larger majority on June 8th: Here\u2019s Dean Turner, an economist at UBS Wealth Management: \u201cWe believe it is highly likely the Conservatives will increase their majority and firm up the future direction of government policy, particularly in regard to Brexit.\u201d Simon Derrick of Bank of New York Mellon agrees: \u201cI guess people see that this may give Theresa May a better majority. It is a politically astute move and it should provide more stability going over the immediate aftermath of the exit from the EU.\u201d The latest odds from online betting exchange Betfair suggest they\u2019re right: UK Next General Election \u2013 Most Seats Conservative 1.11 (1/9) Labour 12 (11/1) Lib Dems 50 (49/1) UKIP 200 (199/1) Any Other 300 (299/1) Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, hopes that the general election won\u2019t JUST focus on Brexit. Politicians need to offer solutions to other problems, such as the rise of robotics and the gig economy, he says: \u201cBusinesses are having to get used to being buffeted by the changing winds of politics at the moment, and will just have to endure yet another campaign. This must be used as a chance to properly debate what leaving the EU means for the long-term future of the UK, including how we continue to bring in the skills employers need. \u201cWhile Brexit will inevitably dominate the campaign, there are also much wider questions that need to be addressed on the changing nature of business and work, automation and our ageing society. These can\u2019t be ignored in the run up to June 8, and the business voice must be heard in this crucial discussion.\u201d The pound had rallied because Theresa May is likely to win a \u201csignificant majority\u201d, says Peter Ashton, managing director of Eiger FX: \u201cThere is still huge uncertainty surrounding the implementation of Brexit but a strong majority party will help to provide a degree of stability while we negotiate the choppy waters ahead. Rob Aird, corporate partner at law firm Ashurst, says Theresa May\u2019s decision shows just how big and complex Brexit will be. He argues that the general election will have two principal effects: Optimists will say that it gives the public a chance to have their say on who should run the country during the negotiation process and how that process should be run. Cynics will argue that the Government has called this election as they sense an opportunity to increase their parliamentary majority, and extend their time in power, which will likely make agreeing and implementing Brexit (and any transitional arrangements) much easier to achieve domestically. Britain\u2019s stock market is on track for its biggest one-day fall in three months, as the surge in the pound hits shares in London. The FTSE 100, which is packed with Britain\u2019s largest companies and many multinationals, has shed 116 points to 7210. Only four of the 97 companies in the Footsie are up today. That\u2019s partly because a stronger pound will push down the value of their overseas earnings. Mining companies are leading the selloff. They were already down before May\u2019s announcement, following a sharp fall in the price of Chinese iron ore. Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, is worried that a general election could be a damaging distraction. \u201cMany business communities will understandably be concerned that attention will inevitably shift from the economy and the intricacies of leaving the EU to a potential election campaign. Firms will want to be reassured that the key challenges facing the economy will be front and centre throughout any election period.\u201d Many City experts (like many MPs!) have been caught off-guard by today\u2019s shock news. Aberdeen Asset Management Investment Manager Luke Bartholomew says it will take a while for investors to calculate what it means for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. \u201cNo one was expecting this. Not least because the Government itself ruled an election before 2020 out barely four weeks ago. But Theresa May has clearly smelt an opportunity to consolidate her mandate ahead of the Brexit negotiations. The market reaction has been muted so far. Sterling sold off initially and has now come back. But it will take investors some time to digest the effects of the election in the next few days. A big factor for them is whether the election will make a softer stance on the Brexit negotiations more likely. The election should hand Theresa May a much bigger mandate to stand up to the harder line, anti-EU backbenchers which currently hold a disproportionate sway over her party\u2019s stance on Brexit. That would be welcomed by financial markets. There\u2019s also a decent chance of some volatility now with imminent elections in both the UK and France.\u201d The pound has risen to a four-month high against a basket of international currencies. The pound has surged to its highest level since the start of February, following the dramatic news that Theresa May is calling for a general election on June 8th. Sterling has ripped higher after the prime minister declared that Britain will head to the polls in a few weeks time. With opposition parties backing the plan, the general election is nailed on. And City investors are welcoming the move -- with many predicting a large Conservative win. That has sent the pound roaring up to $1.266, its highest level in 10 weeks, after an early wobble.... Our Politics Live blog is tracking the main news; I\u2019ll pull together City reaction here.... ...starting with Shilen Shah, Bond Strategist at Investec Wealth &amp; Investment, who says: \u201cAfter much speculation this morning, the Prime Minister has confirmed that she is calling an early general election to fully implement the Brexit process. \u201cFollowing some initial weakness ahead of the statement, Sterling has stabilised and is slightly up on the day. Gilts yields have also been stable, with the 10-year yield hitting a session low of 1.01%.Overall, today\u2019s announcement suggests that PM wants full control of the Brexit process without any interference from the opposition.\u201d It\u2019s official! Theresa May has called for a general election, on 8 June. Sterling has actually recovered its early losses, and is back to $1.257 against the US dollar. Full coverage here: FXTM Vice President of Market Research, Jameel Ahmad, sums up the mood in the City right now: There has been some sudden selling in the British Pound over the past few minutes following the news that UK Prime Minister Theresa May will be making a statement within the next hour. There are unconfirmed rumors at this stage circulating that Theresa May might be stepping down, while there are other reports going around that this could be linked to the announcement of a UK general election. Truth be told, nobody is really that aware of what is going on but this uncertainty has caused a reaction in the Sterling. Money is also pouring into UK government bonds, as nervous investors prepare to hear Theresa May\u2019s statement. That has driven the price of UK debt up, sending the yield (or interest rate) on 10-year bonds down to a six-month low. Back in the City, the pound has fallen sharply following the news that prime minister Theresa May will deliver an unexpected statement at 11.15am. The Westminster rumour mill is in overdrive, with speculation of an early general election. And that\u2019s pulled sterling back towards $1.25, having hit a three week high this morning. No-one really knows what\u2019s going on, which is another reason to sell the pound.... Our politics liveblogger Andrew Sparrow is on the case: On the other hand, the euro could rally if French voters plump for a more mainstream candidate. Kathleen Brooks of City Index predicts a \u2018relief rally\u2019 if Marine Le Pen is eliminated in the first round of voting, on Sunday. She writes: Since Marine Le Pen is the most euro-toxic of all of the candidates, one can assume that a first round eradication for her Front National Party could trigger a relief rally in the euro in a week from now. We mentioned in our previous note on the French election that Francois Fillon\u2019s candidacy was worth a second look. He has a solid block of conservative voters, whose numbers may be swelled if it is a means of keeping Le Pen out of the Elysee Palace. Added to that, French voters are surprisingly immune to scandals, such as those that have plagued Fillon\u2019s candidacy. While the latest odds still give independent Emmanuel Macron a healthy chance of winning in May, his odds have fallen as those of Fillon and Far Left candidate Melenchon have surged. If we get a Macron/ Fillon second round run-off, this is likely to be considered \u201cmarket friendly\u201d, triggering a rally in the euro, the Cac, but also in the German Dax and Eurostoxx index, which have had decent correlations with the French bond yield this year. Jordan Hiscott, chief Trader at ayondo markets, believes the euro would suffer sharp losses if the French election delivers a surprise result. The euro is flat against the dollar this morning, at $1.065 - but it would probably tumble to parity if either Marine Le Pen or Jean-Luc Melenchon defies the odds and wins the presidential race. Hiscott says: While at opposite ends of the spectrum politically, both are unhappy with the current terms of being in the Euro, with Le Pen after an outright referendum and Melenchon pushing for re-negotiation of the current terms, or an exit if this can\u2019t be achieved. What can we determine from this? Two French politicians at opposite ends of the political spectrum, almost united in their mutual dislike, in its current form, of an institution they were the key founders of and have been the biggest supporters of for the past 30 years. \u201cIf we extrapolate this to Europe\u2019s financial assets, looking at EUR-USD in particular, the prognosis is not good. The dual effect of two anti-EU politicians could weigh heavily and while currently trading around 1.0625, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see parity with the US dollar following a Le Pen or Melenchon victory. Amazingly enough, this wouldn\u2019t be a level seen since the October 31 2002, and a lifetime away from the all-time high of 1.60 in 2008. Whatever the result from the French elections, its arguable, the fragmentation of Europe is in swing.\u201d France\u2019s borrowing costs have inched up this morning, widening the gap with safe-haven German debt. That\u2019s a signal that investors are getting more worried about Sunday\u2019s election. Reuters has the details: France\u2019s 10-year bond yield rose 2.5 basis points in early Tuesday trade to 0.93 percent, while German Bund yields were marginally lower at 0.18 percent and within sight of Friday\u2019s more than three-month low of 0.16 percent. That left the gap between the two at 75 basis points and not far from six-week highs hit last week around 78 bps. The spread between short-dated French and German bond yields was at 44 bps - also within sight of six-week highs. Christine Lagarde has also claimed that Britain\u2019s economy is starting to suffer from last year\u2019s Brexit vote -- even though growth has been rather stronger than the IMF predicted. QUESTION - You say the UK is still having growth, being still in the EU. Do you think that Brexit can be a bad trip for the UK? MS. LAGARDE - As you know, we had anticipated a much lower growth than the UK has demonstrated during the last quarters. But we are beginning to see \u2013 in terms of disposable incomes, of depreciation of the currency, etc. \u2013 the beginning of the impact of Brexit. And the more discussion there is of companies or financial institutions relocating to Frankfurt, Dublin or Paris, the more uncertainty there will be in a country where the capital city plays such a role as a financial center. The IMF will release its latest forecasts for the UK in under five hours time, as part of the World Economic Outlook. It has already revised up its 2017 growth forecast once this year, in January - from 1.1% to 1.5%...... On America, Lagarde seems to acknowledge that criticism of Germany\u2019s trade surplus are valid --- although she doesn\u2019t approve of Donald Trump\u2019s approach: QUESTION - Is Trump right to criticize the German trade surplus? Are the bad guys saying the right things? MS. LAGARDE - I would stay away of the \u201cbad guy\u201d language--that is a moral judgement that does not have a place in the kind of work we do. When there are excessive imbalances, when there is excessive inequality, or instability in the financial system, all those three are bad for stability, for the sustainability of growth. We do not shy away from saying that. During her interview with European reporters, Christine Lagarde also warned that the IMF is adamant that Greece needs debt relief - and it won\u2019t join its bailout programme until this is tackled. QUESTION - Without a debt restructure upfront, the IMF will not participate? MS. LAGARDE - If the Greek debt is not sustainable in accordance with the IMF\u2019s rules and on the basis of reasonable parameters, we will not participate in the program. QUESTION - Is the staff of the IMF now convinced that the debt is not sustainable as it is? MS. LAGARDE - Based on the debt sustainability analysis, we will determine how much debt needs to be restructured. But there is no question in our mind that a degree of debt restructuring is needed. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest French polling data: Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has warned that the French presidential election is casting a \u201chuge question mark\u201d over the eurozone. In an interview with several European journalists, just published, Lagarde says that France\u2019s election race is causing rising uncertainty worldwide, and creating fresh uncertainty over the future of the currency bloc. Here\u2019s the key section: Q: Is the fate of the euro also at stake in the French presidential elections? MS. LAGARDE - It is clearly one of the debates. And one that actually weighs on the confidence and the stability of the euro area--because if one of the largest partners is wondering if its destiny and fate is in or out of the group, it is a huge question mark for the others. Two of the candidates in this spring\u2019s election have made no secret of their opposition to European institutions. Marine Le Pen, the head of the National Front, has repeatedly blamed the single currency for hurting France\u2019s economy - arguing that the country would prosper if it returned to the franc. Poll suggest that she could win the first round of voting, this Sunday. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the far-left candidate who is making a late surge in the polls, is also a critic of the European Union. He has vowed to renegotiate France\u2019s relationship with the EU - and hold a referendum on exiting the Union if he fails. Many political analysts argue that Le Pen would lose the second-round run-off to either Emmanuel Macron or Francois Fillon -- both of whom are less critical of the euro. But, as Christine Lagarde puts it, there is clearly \u201crising concern\u201d about the uncertain outcome of the elections. She says: There is no single country that I have visited in the last couple of months where I have not been asked with anxiety what the outcome might be. It matters because of the role played by France, the size of the French economy relative to other euro area partners, and because some of the ideas being discussed seem aimed at disrupting the current architecture of the European Union as far as France is concerned. The sooner that uncertainty is removed, and I guess it will have to wait until May 7th, the better it will be for the global economy, and of course, for the euro area economy. I\u2019ll truffle through the interviews for more significant points now... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders have lots to ponder as they return to their desks following the Easter holidays break, with plenty of geopolitical risks swirling. The French presidential election, last weekend\u2019s controversial Turkish referendum, and rising tensions between America and North Korea could all move the markets this week. With less than a week to go until the first round of voting, France\u2019s election looks pretty tight. Far-left politician Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon is making a late charge, gaining ground on centrist Emmanuel Macron, right-winger Francois Fillon and National Front leader Marine Le Pen. Interestingly, Fillon appears to be shaking off the allegations of wrongful payments to family members that rattled his campaign. Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale explains: The latest poll (from Opinionway) puts macron and Le pen at 22%, Fillon at 21% and Melenchon at 18%. So where last week it was Melenchon who was surging, now M Fillon is closing in. Uncertainty reigns supreme and relative rates are going to struggle to drive the Euro higher against that backdrop. All the main candidates are making a late push before Sunday\u2019s polls; the top two will enter the crucial second-round runoff in early May. Further afield, Pyongyang\u2019s latest (failed) missile test is a particular concern to investors - especially as a senior North Korean official has warned that \u201cthermonuclear war may break out at any moment\u201d. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets reckons investors are looking for Washington\u2019s reaction (vice-president Mike Pence is in South Korea today). North Korea faced another failure in its nuclear test and investors are wondering what will be the reaction from the US and its allies. The demand for other safe haven assets also picked up in the light of this, spot gold is moving further closer to our target of $1300. We are sitting near a five month high. When it comes to the gold price, we do think that the momentum could easily continue and bias remain skewed for more upside move. Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG in Melbourne, says: \u201cIt seems the focus is now firmly on future missile tests from North Korea and whether any future tests will actually be successful. One suspects the concerns in North Korea have further to play out.\u201d The Turkish lira, meanwhile, has rallied after Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan claimed a narrow, and contested, victory in a referendum to reshape Turkey\u2019s constitution as a presidential republic. The lira gained 2% against the US dollar yesterday as investors calculate that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s win means less political instability. It will certainly give him sweeping new powers; critics fear more authoritarianism and further crackdowns against the president\u2019s opponents. The legitimacy of the result is being questioned \u2013 as more than 1 million votes without official stamps were included. That hasn\u2019t stopped Donald Trump giving Erdo\u011fan a congratulations call, though..... IG predicts that the London stock market will dip in early trading, but other European markets are expected to rise. On the agenda today.... The International Monetary Fund will release its latest assessment of the global economy today, at 2pm BST (or 9am Washington time). This is the IMF\u2019s chance to upgrade, or downgrade, its growth forecasts - and also point to problems in the world economy. Last week, IMF chief Christine Lagarde hinted that global growth forecasts could be revised up, despite its concerns over the protectionist trade policies advocated by Donald Trump. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

First, the deal when struck will need Parliamentary approval, and then be subject to a \u2018phasing in\u2019 period (Mr Hammond has suggested two years) to allow firms, consumers and officials to adjust to the new arrangements. A second independence referendum in pro-EU Scotland, though not precluding Brexit, would also have provided an extra hurdle to completing it before the previous election deadline of May 2020.</p> <p>Second, the UK is relying on a cooperative sign-off by its 27 EU peers.

Most multinationals listed on the London stock exchange earn the majority of their profits in dollars, which have been worth more due to sterling\u2019s decline in the wake of the EU vote. However, sterling\u2019s swift rise following the prime minister\u2019s surprise move sent major stocks tumbling, with mining conglomerates hit hardest. After an initial wobble when news of the election hit the market, the pound powered ahead, hitting a four-month high against the dollar of $1.283. Against the euro, sterling also surged to \u20ac1.19, a gain of 1%. In a striking reversal of the post-referendum stock market, the FTSE 100 closed down 180 points on the day, a fall of 2.5% that wiped about \u00a345.7bn off valuations. Confidence in the City about an easy victory for the Conservatives was behind much of sterling\u2019s rise, with many speculating that a victory will give May a stronger mandate to plot a moderate line on Brexit and resist hardline anti-EU backbenchers.

But in the wake of the snap general election, it said it was ditching its bets against the pound. The stockbroker Brewin Dolphin said that the rise in sterling might appear \u201ccounter-intuitive\u201d as traders have been betting on sterling falling ever since last June\u2019s Brexit vote. \u201cThe election is likely to shore up the government\u2019s hard Brexit line, making it even more likely to happen.

      "bodyText": "Vijay Mallya, the multimillionaire co-owner of the Force India Formula One team, has been arrested in London on behalf of Indian authorities investigating allegations of fraud in connection with the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines. Scotland Yard said Mallya, who fled to the UK from India to avoid arrest in relation to \u00a31bn of unpaid debts, was arrested on an extradition warrant on Tuesday. Mallya was \u201carrested on behalf of the Indian authorities in relation to accusations of fraud\u201d, the police said. Mallya appeared before Westminster magistrates court and was bailed on a \u00a3650,000 bond to return for an extradition hearing on 17 May. The 61-year-old businessman, who has referred to himself as the \u201cKing of Good Times\u201d, is living in a \u00a311.5m Hertfordshire mansion once owned by the father of F1 driver Lewis Hamilton. On Twitter Mallya, who has been seen in a chauffeur-driven Silver Maybach bearing the number plate with his initials VJM-1, dismissed excitement surrounding his arrest as \u201cmedia hype\u201d and said the court appearance was \u201cexpected\u201d before an extradition hearing. He denies the fraud allegations. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has made it a priority to bring Mallya, who made most of his fortune from Kingfisher beer and spirits, back to the country to stand trial over an estimated 94bn rupees (\u00a31bn) of debt owed to state-owned banks after the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines in 2012. Modi\u2019s government has described Mallya \u2013 who used to travel the globe on a private jet with VJM painted in gold on the engines and wingtips \u2013 as a \u201cfugitive from justice\u201d. AFter the arrest on Tuesday, Indian finance minister, Santosh Gangwar, said: \u201cVijay Mallya will be brought back to India. Due process of law will be followed.\u201d The Indian authorities say that Mallya fled to the UK in March 2016 in order to avoid arrest over alleged fraud surrounding the collapse of the airline. The Indian government revoked his passport last April, and the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation filed formal fraud charges against him. Indian investigators said last year Mallya had ignored their summons to give evidence three times. Mallya has denied that he fled to the UK, and said he travelled frequently to the UK on business. Mallya, who had previously been likened to Sir Richard Branson for his entrepreneurial flair, became a poster boy for greed in India when he held a lavish two-day 60th birthday party at his huge beachfront Kingfisher Villa in Goa. The party, which reportedly cost more than $2m (\u00a31.56m), included performances by Bollywood singer Sonu Nigam and Enrique Iglesias, who sang on stage with Mallya. Raghuram Rajan, who was then governor of India\u2019s central bank, said: \u201cIf you flaunt your birthday bashes even while owing the system a lot of money, it does seem to suggest to the public that you don\u2019t care.\u201d Mallya was known internationally for his extravagant parties, which included annual parties on his 311ft superyacht Indian Empress during the Monte Carlo grand prix. Since his self-imposed exile in the UK Mallya has said tales of his high-rolling lifestyle are \u201cbollocks\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense \u2013 a figment of everybody\u2019s imagination. I am a very private, simple guy,\u201d he told the FT during an interview at the Dorchester hotel last year. More than 4,000 Kingfisher Airlines employees went without pay for seven months before they revolted and grounded the carrier in October 2012. The Kingfisher Villa was sold off by Mallya\u2019s creditors for nearly \u00a39m this year and the Airbus private jet, which boasts gold ashtrays and a golden sink, has been put up for auction. Mallya has been living in a three-storey mansion with a swimming pool and tennis court in the quiet Hertfordshire village of Tewin. The house, called Ladywalk, was bought from Lewis Hamilton\u2019s father Anthony by offshore companies, believed to be linked to Mallya. Last year, Mallya told the Sunday Times \u201cmy official address in the UK is at Ladywalk\u201d, and said: \u201cThe ownership structure of Ladywalk is perfectly legal.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Vijay Mallya, the multimillionaire co-owner of the Force India Formula One team, has been arrested in London on behalf of Indian authorities investigating allegations of fraud in connection with the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines. </p> <p><a href=\"http://news.met.police.uk/news/extradition-warrant-arrest-on-behalf-of-indian-authorities-235939\">Scotland Yard said</a> Mallya, who fled to the UK from India to avoid arrest in relation to \u00a31bn of unpaid debts, was arrested on an extradition warrant on Tuesday. Mallya was \u201carrested on behalf of the Indian authorities in relation to accusations of fraud\u201d, the police said. </p> <p>Mallya appeared before Westminster magistrates court and was bailed on a \u00a3650,000 bond to return for an extradition hearing on 17 May. The 61-year-old businessman, who has referred to himself as the \u201cKing of Good Times\u201d, is living in a \u00a311.5m Hertfordshire mansion once owned by the father of F1 driver Lewis Hamilton. </p> <p> On Twitter Mallya, who has been seen in a chauffeur-driven <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anantgoenka/status/722914371966373888\">Silver Maybach bearing the number plate with his initials VJM-1</a>, dismissed excitement surrounding his arrest as \u201cmedia hype\u201d and said the court appearance was \u201cexpected\u201d before an extradition hearing. He denies the fraud allegations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheVijayMallya/status/854294437089902593\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Usual Indian media hype. Extradition hearing in Court started today as expected.</p>&mdash; Vijay Mallya (@TheVijayMallya) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheVijayMallya/status/854294437089902593\">April 18, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has made it a priority to bring Mallya, who made most of his fortune from Kingfisher beer and spirits, back to the country to stand trial over an estimated 94bn rupees (\u00a31bn) of debt owed to state-owned banks after the collapse of Kingfisher Airlines in 2012. </p> <p>Modi\u2019s government has described Mallya \u2013 who used to travel the globe on a private jet with VJM painted in gold on the engines and wingtips \u2013 as a \u201cfugitive from justice\u201d. </p> <p>AFter the arrest on Tuesday, Indian finance minister, Santosh Gangwar, said: \u201cVijay Mallya will be brought back to India. Due process of law will be followed.\u201d</p> <p>The Indian authorities say that Mallya fled to the UK in March 2016 in order to avoid arrest over alleged fraud surrounding the collapse of the airline. The Indian government revoked his passport last April, and the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation filed formal fraud charges against him. </p> <p>Indian investigators said last year Mallya had ignored their summons to give evidence three times. Mallya has denied that he fled to the UK, and said he travelled frequently to the UK on business. </p> <p>Mallya, who had previously been likened to Sir Richard Branson for his entrepreneurial flair, became a poster boy for greed in India when he held a lavish two-day 60th birthday party at his huge beachfront Kingfisher Villa in Goa. The party, which reportedly cost more than $2m (\u00a31.56m), included performances by Bollywood singer Sonu Nigam and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMO-Xxbsv5E\">Enrique Iglesias, who sang on stage with Mallya</a>. </p> <p>Raghuram Rajan, who was then governor of India\u2019s central bank, said: \u201cIf you flaunt your birthday bashes even while owing the system a lot of money, it does seem to suggest to the public that you don\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>Mallya was known internationally for his extravagant parties, which included annual parties on his <a href=\"http://www.superyachtfan.com/superyacht/superyacht_indian_empress.html\">311ft superyacht Indian Empress</a> during the Monte Carlo grand prix. Since his self-imposed exile in the UK Mallya has said tales of his high-rolling lifestyle are \u201cbollocks\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense \u2013 a figment of everybody\u2019s imagination. I am a very private, simple guy,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85252402-1249-11e6-839f-2922947098f0\">he told the FT during an interview at the Dorchester hotel last year</a>. </p> <p>More than 4,000 Kingfisher Airlines employees went without pay for seven months before they revolted and grounded the carrier in October 2012. </p> <p>The Kingfisher Villa was sold off by Mallya\u2019s creditors for nearly \u00a39m this year and the Airbus private jet, which boasts gold ashtrays and a golden sink, has been put up for auction. </p> <p>Mallya has been living in a three-storey mansion with a swimming pool and tennis court in the quiet Hertfordshire village of Tewin. The house, called Ladywalk, was bought from Lewis Hamilton\u2019s father Anthony by offshore companies, believed to be linked to Mallya. </p> <p>Last year, Mallya told the Sunday Times \u201cmy official address in the UK is at Ladywalk\u201d, and said: \u201cThe ownership structure of Ladywalk is perfectly legal.\u201d</p>",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "IMF ratchets up UK economic growth forecast to 2%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has revised up its UK growth forecast for the second time in three months after admitting that the performance of the economy since the Brexit vote last year had been stronger than expected. In its half-yearly World Economic Outlook, the IMF said it now envisaged the British economy expanding by 2% in 2017 \u2013 making it the second fastest-growing advanced economy after the US.. It noted that growth had \u201cremained solid in the United Kingdom, where spending proved resilient in the aftermath of the June 2016 referendum in favour of leaving the European Union [Brexit]\u201d. The IMF said it was becoming more optimistic about the prospects for the global economy \u2013 expected to expand by 3.5% in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018 \u2013 but issued a renewed attack on the protectionist policies championed by Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen. \u201cThe global economy seems to be gaining momentum \u2013 we could be at a turning point,\u201d said Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor. \u201cBut even as things look up, the post\u2013world war two system of international economic relations is under severe strain despite the aggregate benefits it has delivered \u2013 and precisely because growth and the resulting economic adjustments have too often entailed unequal rewards and costs within countries.\u201d The IMF penciled in 2017 growth of 1.1% for the UK in its previous outlook in October 2016 but subsequently revised up that forecast to 1.5% in January this year. Growth is expected to slow to 1.5% in 2018 \u2013 slightly weaker than the IMF\u2019s previous prediction. \u201cThe 0.9 percentage point upward revision to the 2017 forecast and the 0.2 percentage point downward revision to the 2018 forecast reflect the stronger-than-expected performance of the UK economy since the June Brexit vote, which points to a more gradual materialisation than previously anticipated of the negative effects of the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union,\u201d the IMF said. The IMF was also more cautious about the longer-term impact on the economy from Brexit than it was in the run-up to last June\u2019s referendum. \u201cThough highly uncertain, medium-term growth prospects have also diminished in the aftermath of the Brexit vote because of the expected increase in barriers to trade and migration, as well as a potential downsizing of the financial services sector amid possible barriers to cross-border financial activity.\u201d The IMF added that the challenge for the UK was to \u201csuccessfully navigate the exit from the European Union and negotiate the new arrangements for economic relations with the European Union and other trading partners\u201d. The adverse medium-term impact on growth would be lower if the two years of negotiations avoided putting up new economic barriers. The IMF said record low interest rates of 0.25% were appropriate given that growth was expected to slow and inflation was likely to peak at 2.5% this year. It signaled, however, that the end of the Bank of England\u2019s ultra-low monetary policy was coming to an end, predicting a \u201cless gradual normalisation\u201d of interest rates than six months ago. Responding to the UK\u2019s upgraded forecast, chancellor Philip Hammond said: \u201cThe fundamentals of our economy are strong and we continue to invest in the skills needed for a stronger and fairer Britain ... In Washington this week \u200eI will be talking to our international partners about how we can carry on increasing global economic growth, with Britain again playing an active and engaged role in the global economy.\u201d The IMF\u2019s Obstfeld tempered his more upbeat assessment for the global economy with a warning that the recent improvement might not last. \u201cConsistently good economic news since summer 2016 is starting to add up to a brightening global outlook,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, however, the upgrade to our 2017 forecast is modest, and longer-term potential growth rates remain subdued across the globe compared with past decades, especially in advanced economies. Moreover, while there is a chance growth will exceed expectations in the near term, significant downside risks continue to cloud the medium-term outlook, and indeed may have intensified since our last forecast.\u201d The Fund listed six downside risks including: protectionism; faster than expected interest rate increases in the UK leading to financial market disruption; an aggressive rolling-back of financial regulation leading to excessive risk taking; and the vulnerability of China\u2019s financial system after a period of rapid credit growth. Obstfeld said: \u201cOne salient threat is a turn toward protectionism, leading to trade warfare. Mainly in advanced economies, several factors \u2013 lower growth since the 2010\u201311 recovery from the global financial crisis, even slower growth of median incomes, and structural labour-market disruptions \u2013 have generated political support for zero-sum policy approaches that could undermine international trading relationships, along with multi-lateral cooperation more generally.\u201d Avoiding a new trade war will be a central theme of this week\u2019s spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Both organisations have been alarmed at the growth in protectionist pressures in the past few years. \u201cCapitulating to those pressures would result in a self-inflicted wound, leading to higher prices for consumers and businesses, lower productivity, and therefore, lower overall real income for households,\u201d Obstfeld said. Speaking at a press conference following the publication of the report, Obstfeld said the snap general election could create short-term uncertainty but the outlook could stabilise after polling day.",

      "bodyText": "UK cereal brand Weetabix is to be snapped up by the US company Post Holdings in a deal worth \u00a31.4bn. The breakfast cereal favourite, made in Britain since 1932, was put up for sale in January by China\u2019s Bright Food which took a majority stake in 2012. Weetabix is made in the small town of Burton Latimer, near Kettering, Northamptonshire, and will become part of America\u2019s third-largest cereal company. Other brands owned by Post Holdings include Bran Flakes and Fruity Pebbles. The Weetabix portfolio includes Alpen, the No 1 muesli brand in the UK, Ready Brek, Barbara\u2019s and Weetos. The company employs about 1,800 people globally, with 60% of the workforce in the UK. While it has some overseas manufacturing plants, all of the wheat that goes into Weetabix biscuits is grown within 50 miles of its base in Burton Latimer. The deal is expected to complete in the third quarter of 2017 and gives Post access to the UK market through an established brand, as well as an opportunity to find new markets for its own brands, including protein shakes and bars. When Shanghai-based Bright Food bought Weetabix, it had hoped the cereal would become popular in China as part of a general trend towards more western eating habits. However, while sales of Weetabix have risen in China, market share has disappointed as traditional rice and steamed bread remain popular breakfast staples. Weetabix is exported to more than 90 countries but the UK accounts for the majority of sales and the brand is a royal warrant holder. It was family-owned until 2004, when it was bought by a Texas private equity firm. It was later sold to another private equity firm, Lion Capital. Other potential suitors interested in Weetabix were thought to have included the UK\u2019s Associated British Foods, Cereal Partners Worldwide and Italian pasta maker Barilla. Confirming the deal on Tuesday, Post\u2019s president and chief executive, Rob Vitale, said: \u201cWe have long admired Weetabix as a leader in cereal and believe it will be a fantastic strategic fit within Post. \u201cCombining together two category leaders [Alpen] continues our strategy of strengthening our portfolio in stable categories and diversifying into new markets, bringing much-loved brands to significantly more customers globally. We are excited about the growth opportunities that this acquisition brings.\u201d Post, founded in 1895 and based in St Louis, Missouri, said it had agreed to establish a joint venture with Bright Food and an investment fund advised by Baring Private Equity Asia to manage the Weetabix China operations. Giles Turrell, chief executive of Weetabix, said its new owners would help the company to grow. \u201cThe past five years have seen us increase our branded sales at home and overseas. I\u2019m confident [Post] will help us open doors for continued expansion.\u201d Turrell will take on the new role of chairman of Weetabix and will be responsible for managing the integration of the two companies. Sally Abbott, currently director of marketing at Weetabix, will become managing director of Weetabix UK and Ireland. Turrell said job cuts were not expected in the UK and that its new owners would allow the business to grow. \u201cPost has no footprint or manufacturing in the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as we remain successful in the marketplace we will continue to manufacture at our plants here in Northamptonshire.\u201d Unite, the UK\u2019s largest union, said it had requested an urgent meeting with the new owner of Weetabix to gain assurances on jobs. Unite represents more than 110 workers, including engineering and technical staff, at Weetabix\u2019s UK plants in Burton Latimer and Corby. \u201cWe want to work constructively with the new management team to ensure the success of the iconic Weetabix brand and to safeguard the future employment for our hardworking and dedicated members,\u201d said Sally Mortimer, regional officer for Unite. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the proposed deal was the latest in a string of approaches for UK companies since the Brexit vote last June and the subsequent sharp fall in the pound. \u201cThe deal comes hot on the heels of Kraft Heinz\u2019s bid for Unilever and 21st Century Fox\u2019s approach for Sky, and further transatlantic deals may be flushed out by the strong dollar and rising US interest rates. \u201cWeetabix has struggled to crack the Chinese market, so it is no surprise to see Bright Food selling up. It\u2019s also unsurprising to see one of the UK\u2019s biggest cereal brands remain in foreign ownership, due to the pound\u2019s weakness.\u201d Post has annual revenues of $5bn(\u00a34bn) expects to make annual savings of about \u00a320m a year before the third full year after completion of the deal, from shared administration and infrastructure among other things. It estimates that Weetabix will contribute about \u00a3120m of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, excluding cost savings. Weetabix\u2019s revenue was about \u00a3410m in 2016. Beyond the UK, Weetabix has operations in North America, South Africa, Germany and Spain, and it is the majority owner of a joint venture in Kenya that serves the African market. The UK and Ireland remain its biggest market, followed by North America and China.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wine producers in Britain will plant a record 1m vines over the next 12 months, allowing growers to produce 2m more bottles of wine a year in the south of a country not historically known for its viticulture. The figures demonstrate that wine is one of the fastest-growing agricultural products in the UK. Over the last 10 years the number of acres planted with grapevines in England and Wales has grown by 135%, according to the English Wine Producers trade body. Among those planting new rootstocks are two big French champagne houses, Taittinger and Vranken-Pommery Monopole, which have announced English wine projects in the past year in Canterbury and Hampshire. Rathfinny wine estate near Alfriston in East Sussex is one of the largest new vineyards, with up to 400 acres being cultivated. Its owner, the former London hedge fund manager Mark Driver, plans to release its first sparkling wine in 2018. A French winemaker who trained at champagne houses Louis Roederer and Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon is overseeing the blend. \u201cThe French finally admit they like our wines,\u201d said Oz Clarke, an expert who is helping to judge a new award for for wines made in Britain. \u201cNew York decides that English bubbles are the next big cool wine \u2018thing\u2019. And we are planting a million new vines in our nation this year. We are bubbling with confidence.\u201d Global warming has been credited with providing a later English growing season and making the industry viable across Kent, the east of England and as far west as Wales. Improving technology is another key factor. Sophisticated meters that determine grape sugar levels allow growers to determine the best picking period in what can be a few brief days to harvest the crop. More precise meteorological forecasts have also helped the English to cope with one of the world\u2019s most changeable weather systems. A shift to buying more expensive vintages has also encouraged consumers to trade up to English wines, which typically start at \u00a310 a bottle, although the top sparklers such as Nyetimber, made in West Sussex, retail for about \u00a335. Sales of domestically grown wine have been on an upward swing since 2000, with Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer now offering dozens of different English and Welsh wines, and top retailers and restaurants stocking more and more lines. In recognition, the industry has launched a competition to celebrate England and Wales\u2019s wine producers, and to crown the UK\u2019s very best wine. The inaugural UK Wine awards will be led by experts including Susie Barrie, who appears on BBC One\u2019s Saturday Kitchen, Clarke and the sommelier and wine writer Hamish Anderson. Wines from English and Welsh producers will be tasted blind by the judges over two days, with the results announced on 31 May. Rebecca Hull, the English wine buyer at Waitrose and one of the prize judges, said demand for domestic wine had been growing for many years and that she expected the trend to continue. \u201cThese wines are world class and the awards will serve to highlight some of the gems produced on our own doorstep,\u201d she said. Harvey Nichols is introducing four new producers and 15 new English wines to its wine shop shelves in time for English wine week at the end of May. The bottles from Gusbourne, Hattingley Valley, Litmus and Wiston include still wines for the first time. \u201cSales have been steadily increasing since 2011, but in 2016 we saw a peak in interest,\u201d said Rob Graves, the head of wine and food buying at the upmarket retailer. \u201cOur customers are hugely supportive of this category and they are keen to taste wines from lesser-known producers.\u201d Nick Jarman, the general manager at the Oxo Tower restaurant on the South Bank in London, said: \u201cEnglish wine is growing in popularity among our customers and we\u2019ve seen a steady increase in sales over the last few years. We recently introduced two English wines by the glass which have performed well Often our customers are surprised that the quality is so excellent. We now list eight still wines and 13 sparkling, more than double than two years ago.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 19 April 2017. Because of an editing error, an earlier version said the award was for \u201cBritish wine\u201d. That term is used to refer to the product of imported grapes or grape concentrate that is made into wine in Britain.",
