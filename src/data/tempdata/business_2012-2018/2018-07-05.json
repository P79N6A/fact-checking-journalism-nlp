      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today. Here\u2019s a brisk summary UK car sales fell last month, as the diesel crisis continued to hurt the sector. Sales were down 3.3% compared to a year earlier, with diesel registrations tumbling by 28%. Economists blamed uncertainty over diesel\u2019s future, after the emissions-rigging scandal. Subdued consumer confidence may be another factor. A string of MPs have urged the government not to risk a hard Brexit, after Jaguar Land Rover became the latest company to sound the alarm. JLR warned that \u00a380bn of potential investment was at risk, if it couldn\u2019t expect frictionless trade wit the EU. There were other signs that Brexit is having a damaging impact, as the cabinet prepares for tomorrow\u2019s crucial meeting on a customs deal. Some Brexit supporters are already unhappy with Theresa May\u2019s latest proposal. German business bosses said they were reluctant to invest in Britain, and investment bank JP Morgan began moving some staff overseas. The Bank of England governor has warned that Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist trade policies are already hurting the global economy. Mark Carney was more upbeat about the UK economy, though, sounding confident that the slowdown earlier this year was being reversed. Goodnight! A late newsflash from America. US central bankers are concerned that a trade war could derail the country\u2019s strong growth. The minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest meeting, just released, show that: \u201cMost (policymakers) noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects.\u201d But otherwise, the Fed believes that recent economic data shows that the US recovery remains robust. It was business as usual for Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s tens of thousands of workers today, despite worries about the company\u2019s future under a hard Brexit. One worker at JLR\u2019s plant in Solihull feared trouble ahead, telling the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before something bad happens, isn\u2019t it? We can\u2019t keep on being so lucky,\u201d Another, though, argued that JLR had invested too much in the site to simply walk away. \u201cThey have put billions into this and we hear all the time they are planning future investments on this site. More here: The CBI\u2019s head of EU negotiations, Nicole Sykes, explains why UK firms are now going public with their Brexit concerns: Here\u2019s our Q&amp;A about the risks of a hard Brexit to Britain\u2019s car industry: Europe\u2019s stock markets have closed higher tonight, despite the ongoing Brexit tensions. The rally seems to be spurred by suggestions that America might row back on plans for new tariffs on European car imports, if the EU lowered its own tariffs. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Equity markets are in positive territory as it was reported that the US might not impose a 20% tariff on EU cars. This was met with a positive reaction, and it was reported that Angela Merkel might give her support to lower the EU\u2019s tariff on US cars. Traders welcomed the news as it suggests the trade talks are moving in the right direction. This has sent shares in European carmakers higher, with Volkswagen up 4.2%, Daimler gaining 3.8% and BMW up 3.6%. That propelled the German DAX index up by over 1% Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 gained 30 points, or 0.4%, to 7,603. It\u2019s all kicking off at Westminster, as the paperwork for tomorrow\u2019s showdown cabinet meeting leaks. According to The Spectator, the paperwork explains that Britain would commit to \u201congoing harmonisation with EU rules on goods\u201d. Such a move might address the concerns voiced by carmakers over tariff and non-tariff barriers. But (the magazine claims), this could make it harder for Britain to strike a new trade deal with America. Political editor James Forsyth says: Brexiteers are taking this as Theresa May effectively ruling out a post-Brexit trade deal with the US just days before the US President arrives in this country. However, Downing Street are now denying this interpretation, saying Britain is \u201cabsolutely\u201d still seeking a bilateral trade deal with the US after Brexit. But getting a deal that suits America could be harder, if Britain is committed to Europe\u2019s agricultural standards, for example (the chlorinated chicken problem....) Our Politics Live blog has all the details: Away from the UK\u2019s Brexit problems.... we have some solid economic data from America. US service sector companies have posted their strongest growth in four months, thanks to a pick-up in sales and new orders. That matches yesterday\u2019s solid UK service sector data - which also showed growth at a four-month high. Some of Germany\u2019s most powerful businesses have warned that Brexit uncertainty is putting them off investing in the UK. Our colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports: Germany Industry UK, which represents 100 companies, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lufthansa, the train and bus operator Arriva and the steel producer ThyssenKrupp, said it needed \u201ccertainty and clarity about the way forward sooner rather than later\u201d. Bernd Atenstaedt, the chairman and chief executive of GIUK, said it was frustrating for his member businesses because they still did not know what a post-Brexit Britain would look like two years after the referendum. \u201cThere is some reluctance from German business to invest in the UK with projects on hold because of the uncertainty about the future and with only nine months left before the UK leaves the EU, time is running out,\u201d he said. JP Morgan isn\u2019t waiting to the British cabinet to agree what kind of Brexit it wants. According to Reuters, the investment bank has begun the process of moving staff from the City to continental Europe. A small first wave of employees will lead the way in the coming months. Here\u2019s the story: JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has asked \u201cseveral dozen\u201d employees to lead a first wave of relocations from the UK to continental Europe by early next year, as it pushes the button on plans to protect its business post-Brexit, according to a memo sent to staff on Thursday and seen by Reuters. The memo, the first Brexit-related mass communication to JPMorgan\u2019s 16,000-strong UK workforce this year, highlights the organisational and strategic challenges facing global banks as they prepare for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. It comes a day before Prime Minister Theresa May is due to host crunch talks with ministers at her country residence Chequers on how she wants to shape Britain\u2019s future trading relationship with the soon-to-be 27-member club. Signed by Daniel Pinto, chief executive of JPMorgan\u2019s Corporate &amp; Investment Bank and Mary Erdoes, chief executive of the bank\u2019s Asset &amp; Wealth Management division, the email also outlined JPMorgan\u2019s plans to beef up its presence in several other EU cities including Paris, Madrid and Milan. Last year JP Morgan also bought an office block in Dublin, which could help it reshape its operations after Brexit. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman insists the PM is listerning to British businesses about Brexit. He told reporters in Westminster: \u201cThe PM has been very clear that we take the views of business seriously and we also know the importance of providing certainty as we leave the EU,\u201d the spokesman told reporters. We are looking forward to providing further details in the white paper.\u201d That white paper will outline the government\u2019s preferred customs arrangement with the EU. It should be published after tomorrow\u2019s crunch cabinet meeting at the PM\u2019s country residence, Chequers. May isn\u2019t short of views from British businesses either. Jaguar Land Rover is only the latest in a string of firms to go public with their concerns. Other anxious groups include: Airbus, which is threatening to move aircraft wing production out of Britain BMW, which says it could close UK plants if it can\u2019t import components from the EU quickly and reliably after Brexit The Professional and Business Services Council, which warned the PM that lawyers, accountants, surveyors et al need mutual recognition of qualifications, regulations and legal judgements The British Chambers of Commerce, which pointed out that virtually no progress has been made on the issues worrying businesses Former business minister and Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable has weighed in on Jaguar Land Rover. He says JLR isn\u2019t messing about and urges the Conservatives to treat business with more respect. \u201cWhen I was in government I worked very closely with Jaguar Land Rover. It took some considerable effort to get JLR committed to the UK. \u201cI got to know Ralf Speth well enough to know that he\u2019s not bluffing when he says JLR\u2019s position is a hard Brexit would make the company\u2019s position in the UK untenable. \u201cThe Conservatives should listen. But there\u2019s no evidence that they are willing to treat major employers with anything other than complete contempt.\u201d Jim Pickard of the FT has heard that Speth is feeling more and more \u201cdistressed\u201d about the impact Brexit will have on his company. Ouch. Labour MP Alison McGovern has roasted Owen Paterson for his claim that a hard Brexit would be good for JLR. McGovern points out that tariffs aren\u2019t the only worry. Non-tariff barriers (such as \u2018rules of origin\u2019 restrictions, or time-consuming border checks) could hit sales and gum up supply chains. McGovern says: \u201cIt is quite stunning that Owen Paterson thinks himself better placed to comment on Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s future than their own CEO. Perhaps even more striking is his obvious total ignorance of the just-in-time supply chains which make the car industry profitable, and the fact that it is not tariffs, but non-tariff barriers which would be the major obstacle to manufacturers in a no-deal Brexit. People in manufacturing towns across Merseyside, the North and the Midlands know all too well what it feels like when Tories show they just don\u2019t care about our communities and our families\u2019 livelihoods, and they will not stand for it. To protect jobs in the manufacturing industry, the only feasible solution is to stay in the Single Market and the Customs Union.\u201d McGovern\u2019s Wirral South constituency includes the Vauxhall car plant at Ellesmere Port, and is also close to JLR\u2019s Halewood plant. Labour MP Jack Dromey fears that jobs could be lost at Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s Castle Bromwich plant, in his Birmingham Erdington constituency. Dromey says there is \u201cprofound and growing concern\u201d about the impact of Brexit on Erdington, and the wider UK economy. He points out that manufacturers rely on seamless movement of parts to and from Europe, which would be threatened by non-tariff barriers in a hard Brexit. The nature of the automotive industry and \u2018just in time\u2019 arrangements mean that without frictionless trade with our closest trading partners, businesses cannot function and trade properly. Thousands of lorries go backwards and forwards every week to and from the continent. Dromey adds that JLR adds billions of value to the UK economy each year, and is a vital employer. We cannot allow the will of the hard-right Brexiteers to drive the UK down a deeply damaging road which would be disastrous for British business and British workers. \u201cIn one of the poorest constituencies in the country, the Jaguar plant has transformed the lives of thousands of workers. It would be tragic to see those opportunities snatched away from the thousands still out of work.\u201d Stephen Phipson, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, is urging ministers to heed JLR\u2019s concerns about a hard Brexit. Phipson points out that jobs are also at risk at the many small companies who supply parts to the company. \u201cThis clearly underlines the reality being faced by the manufacturing sector. This is not just an issue for big companies, however, but those SMEs who are also heavily exposed in the major supply chains and, as yet, are unable to know what scenario they are planning for. Time is now running out to secure the frictionless and tariff free relationship we need with the EU if there are not to be serious consequences right across UK industry.\u201d Labour MP Maria Eagle fears that Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s Halewood car plant, in her Garston and Halewood constituency, is at risk from a hard Brexit. Eagle says: \u201cSuch a move would mean the end of JLR\u2019s Halewood plant, the end of car manufacturing in South Liverpool and the needless destruction of thousands of the best private sector jobs in Liverpool.\u201d \u201cI am shocked but not surprised at this stark yet realistic warning from JLR chief executive Prof Ralph Speth about the appalling effects of the extreme Tory hard Brexit supported by half the Cabinet &amp; a hardline cabal of Brexit extremists\u201d Nissan, which employs around 7,000 people at its Sunderland car plant, says: \u201cNissan continues to work with the UK government to ensure the company\u2019s long-term success and investment in the UK\u201d Getting back to Jaguar Land Rover.... and Owen Paterson\u2019s claim that Brexit is a super opportunity for carmakers is getting short shrift: It\u2019s official: An England World Cup win would be good for the economy, according to the Bank of England governor. Thanks to dapper manager Gareth Southgate\u2019s success, retailers are already enjoying a \u2018waistcoat bounce\u2019. This chart from Mark Carney\u2019s speech shows just how damaging the Bank believes a trade war could be: Mark Carney appears to be getting into the World Cup spirit: Mark Carney has also used his speech in Newcastle to warn on America\u2019s trade tariffs. Richard Partington reports: Donald Trump has received yet another warning over the threat to the global economy from his mounting trade disputes around the world - this time from the governor of the Bank of England. Speaking in Newcastle, Mark Carney said the president\u2019s growing use of trade tariffs were already having an effect on the world economy by causing a slowdown in exports and for manufacturing. But he warned the situation could get much worse. Should the US raise import tariffs by a further 10% on all of its trading partners, that could knock as much as 2.5% off American growth and 1% off global output. It\u2019s a conservative estimate, because this would be through the direct impact on trade channels alone. Things could get worse still should companies put investments on hold amid the political turmoil. It could also lead to higher borrowing costs, he says. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is speaking in Newcastle, where he says he is more confident now that the slowdown in the UK economy in the first quarter - when growth was just 0.2% - was temporary because of the disruption caused by bad weather. Investors reaction immediately, reading the comments as the latest signal from the Bank that interest rates will rise in August. The pound is currently up 0.1% at $1.3247, having hit an intraday day high of $1.3262. Speaking at the Northern Powerhouse Business Summit, he said: Domestically, the incoming data have given me greater confidence that the softness of UK activity in the first quarter was largely due to the weather, not the economic climate. Rebecca Long Bailey, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, said Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s Brexit warning should be ringing alarm bells for Theresa May. This stark warning from one of the jewels in the crown of British automotive manufacturing should be a klaxon call to Theresa May and her cabinet. They cannot continue to spar with each other and play ideological games whilst British jobs and industries are being pushed off the edge of a cliff. Uncertainty is already hurting investment and if the Government cannot provide urgent assurances to business on negotiating a deal that secures frictionless trade with the EU, our biggest export market, 40,000 jobs at Jaguar Land Rover and countless supply chain businesses could be lost in the blink of an eye, devastating our world leading automotive sector along with the communities that support them. Sean Kemple, director of sales at Close Brothers Motor Finance, says consumer nervousness contributed to the drop in UK car sales last month. June saw the SMMT release a harsh warning about the impact of Brexit on both production output and demand to the UK motor industry, and we\u2019ve certainly seen some hesitance from consumers when it comes to big ticket purchases. This is exacerbated by the uncertainty around diesel, which is having a fierce impact on diesel sale figures. Here\u2019s Ian Gilmartin, Head of Retail &amp; Wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, on the drop in car sales last month: \u201cA dip in overall new car sales is no surprise considering the plethora of challenges being faced by sellers. The industry has rightly been more vocal in recent weeks, with the lack of clarity around what the playing field will look like for the motor market post-Brexit growing. As we saw with Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s warning this morning, patience is running out for both manufacturers and retailers, with all parts of the industry hoping to see some material progress to allow them to plan for the future. As today\u2019s data shows it\u2019s not just a trade issue, with wider questions over diesel policy posing another headache for operators as diesel purchases fell by almost a third in June. The sector has to focus on delivering more environmentally efficient vehicles, but diesel cars have a part to play in this and consumers need reassurance that a diesel purchase is still a sensible move.\u201d Conservative MP Owen Paterson thinks Jaguar Land Rover are wrong to worry about a hard Brexit. Paterson, a Brexit supporter, told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that JLR would be in a \u201cwonderful position\u201d once Britain has left the single market and the customs union. Paterson argues that it\u2019s wrong to assume that tariffs would be imposed on goods travelling into the UK from Europe. He points out: \u201cIf we go to WTO terms, we set our tariffs and we can choose to have no tariffs.\u201d He added out that JLR was enjoying strong sales in China - why shouldn\u2019t that continue after Brexit? I think there\u2019s a few problems with this view, though. There\u2019s no guarantee that the EU won\u2019t set tariffs on UK goods crossing the channel, in the event of a hard Brexit. JLR sold almost 2.5 million cars in Europe in the last quarter, compared to almost 475,000 in the UK. New customs checks at the UK-EU border could slow the movement of goods, if the two sides aren\u2019t committed to \u2018regulatory equivalence\u2019. That might ruin the \u2018just-in-time\u2019 production strategies developed by many large manufacturers to improve productivity and cut down on waste. Wirral West Labour MP Alison McGovern says the government must heed JLR\u2019s warning that a hard Brexit could wipe out its UK profits. She says: \u201cAhead of Friday\u2019s behind-closed-doors Brexit summit at Chequers, the news that Jaguar Land Rover says a hard Brexit outside the Single Market and the Customs Union would make it impossible for them to remain profitable in the UK should send shockwaves through the political establishment. Newsflash: UK car sales fell by 3.5% in June, as drivers continue to shun diesel motors. Some 234,945 new cars were registered across Britain last month, the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports. That\u2019s down from 243,454 a year ago, and ends a two-month run of rising sales. In total, UK car sales in 2018 are down 6.3% so far this year, following declines in the first quarter of 2018. Sales of diesel cars slumped by 28%, as the emissions-testing scandal continues to hit demand. Petrol sales rose 12%, while electric vehicles sales jumped 45% (but at 15,549, that\u2019s only 6.6% of the market). The SMMT blames the slump in diesel sales on \u201ccontinuing consumer uncertainty over future policy towards this technology\u201d. Some cities are already moving towards \u2018clean air\u2019 zones in which more polluting vehicles are banned. The West Midlands and Liverpool could be badly hit if Jaguar Land Rover cuts investment in the UK or moves production overseas because of Brexit. The company runs several manufacturing plants in Britain - which have benefitted from billions of pounds in investment since bought JLR a decade ago. Solihull, Birmingham: More than 6,000 people work here, producing Defender, Discovery, Range Rover and Range Rover Sport models. Castle Bromwich, Birmingham: 3,200 staff produce Jaguar models, including the F-TYPE, XJ, XF and XK Gaydon, Coventry: Land Rover design team are based at this engineering site, using virtual-reality technology, wind tunnels, CAD systems and a test tracks to develop new models Halewood, Liverpool: More than 4,00 people work at this 300-acre site, producing the Range Rover Evoque and the Land Rover Discovery Sport. Whitley, Coventry: JLR\u2019s global headquarters is based here, along with Jaguar Design and Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s corporate staff. Wolverhampton: Almost 1,400 people work at JLR\u2019s new Engine Manufacturing Centre, which the company proudly calls \u201cone of the most cutting-edge facilities of its kind in the UK\u201d. It produces low-emission 4-cylinder Jaguar Land Rover petrol and diesel engines, and is a key part of the company\u2019s expansion strategy in recent years. Union leaders are urging the government to heed Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s warning, rather than play \u2018Russian roulette\u2019 with UK jobs. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, says Theresa May must heed the concerns being voiced by British business leaders, who fear new trade barriers with Europe. McCluskey says: \u201cTens of thousands of decent jobs - the sort we will need more than ever outwith the EU - are being put at risk by a Government that places its survival, indulging narrow, extremist views, above the well-being of the people of this country. This is simply not acceptable. \u201cSo I say this to the Tory party, our jobs are not yours to play Russian roulette with. Drop your red lines and secure a decent deal, one that is to the benefit of the working people of this country. \u201cAnd if you cannot agree to put people before your ideology then move over and let a party that will get on with it.\u201d Earlier this week, Unite said it would push for an early general election if it wasn\u2019t satisfied with the government\u2019s Brexit deal. PB Balaji, chief financial officer at Tata Motors Group, has also weighed in, warning against new trade barriers with Europe. Echoing JLR\u2019s statement, Balaji declares that it\u2019s in \u201cno-one\u2019s interests\u201d to end up with a Brexit which increases bureaucracy and reduces the productivity and competitiveness of the UK Industry. Balaji adds: \u201cJaguar Land Rover and Tata Motors have always maintained that the uncertainties from Brexit are avoidable and the business seeks clarity to ensure that industry takes timely and right decisions to manage the transition. Additionally, Jaguar Land Rover needs free and full access to the single market beyond transition to remain competitive which we also firmly believe is in the best long term interests of the United Kingdom. Shares in Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s parent company have hit a five-year low, after it warned that a hard Brexit could drive it out of the UK. Tata Motors slide by over 4% in early trading in Mumbai, as investors worry about the impact of Brexit on its business. Tata\u2019s shares have now lost half their value since September 2016, as Brexit stormclouds have gathered. As Britain\u2019s largest car maker, Jaguar Land Rover Automotive is a crucial part of Tata Motors. JLR posted reported pre-tax profits of \u00a31.5bn in the last financial year - partly due to stronger sales to China and the US. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s largest carmaker has added its voice to the chorus of businesses warning against a hard Brexit, as negotiations with the EU (and within the cabinet) heat up. Jaguar Land Rover piled fresh pressure on the government by warning that tens of thousands of jobs are at risk, if new trade tariffs with Europe are imposed after Brexit. The news has knocked shares in parent company Tata Motors, and sent another shiver through Britain\u2019s increasingly nervous auto industry. CEO Ralf Speth quantified the impact, warning that a bad Brexit deal would wipe out more than \u00a31.2bn of profits each year - making new investment simply impractical. Speth declared: \u201cAs a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile \u2013 we have spent around \u00a350bn in the UK in the past five years, with plans for a further \u00a380bn more in the next five. This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.\u201d JLR (like many other businesses) needs free and frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market, Speth explained. The warning is deeply alarming for JLR\u2019s 40,000 staff, as the company\u2019s entire future in Britain could be at risk. As Speth put it (via the FT) \u201cIf I\u2019m forced to go out because we don\u2019t have the right deal, then we have to close plants here in the UK and it will be very, very sad. This is hypothetical, and I hope it\u2019s an option we never have to go for.\u201d This intervention comes a day before cabinet ministers meet to discuss Brexit. Theresa May is pushing a \u2018third way\u2019 customs agreement, where the UK tracking goods as they come into the country, and levying EU import taxes on them only if their final destination is inside the EU. That might address some of businesses\u2019 concerns, but hard-line Brexiteers might argue it\u2019s not a clean break with the EU (who might reject the idea anyway). Also coming up today: Bank of England governor Mark Carney is speaking at a major business summit in Newcastle. He\u2019ll be discussing the Northern Powerhouse scheme - City traders will be listening for hints about an August interest rate rise too. June\u2019s UK car registration data are released this morning too - they may show sales rose for the third month running.

Theresa May herself has called it \u201cone of the jewels in the crown of the British economy\u201d, which is a reasonable reflection of the Indian-owned firm\u2019s role in reviving car manufacturing in the UK. One in three cars exported from the UK last year was a Jaguar or a Land Rover. It is why JLR chief executive Ralf Speth\u2019s cold assessment of the costs of a hard Brexit \u2013 \u00a31.2bn in lost profits, mainly from tariffs \u2013 should echo around Chequers this weekend. A few Brexit hardliners may have been tempted to dismiss similar warnings from Airbus last month as a politically motivated stunt given that the governments of France, Germany and Spain always hover in the background at the aerospace firm. But it\u2019s hard to attribute a convoluted conspiracy theory to JLR\u2019s analysis. Even the UK government\u2019s own industrial strategy describes tariff-free and frictionless trade with the EU as \u201cfundamental to the competitiveness of the UK automotive sector\u201d. Speth was just totting up what a collapse in that relationship would mean. His \u00a31.2bn cost of a \u201cbad Brexit\u201d is easy to break down. First comes the cost of trade tariffs on imported components if the UK were to fall back on World Trade Organisation rules. JLR imports about \u00a35bn-worth of production parts from the EU every year. Second, there is the cost of tariffs on exports of finished cars to the EU, which takes about a fifth of the firm\u2019s UK output. Then the company attributed a smaller sum on top for extra \u201cadministrative\u201d expenses, including re-jigging the supply chain to combat possible custom hassles \u2013 a reasonable precaution given that the Solihull plant alone has 1,000 lorry deliveries a day. Brexit risks will be smaller in other big manufacturing sectors, it should be said. Defence giant BAE Systems expects the impact of Brexit to be \u201climited\u201d and one can understand why: projects like Eurofighter are covered by inter-governmental agreements and there is an obligation to keep strategic capabilities, and thus more of the supply base, on home soil. But the car industry is genuinely different. It is a high-volume business that has grown in the UK with the customs union. JLR\u2019s \u00a31.2bn estimate could turn out to be on the high side, of course. The UK wouldn\u2019t have to impose tariffs on components even in the event of \u201cno deal\u201d. The level of sterling would also be important, as would JLR\u2019s own efforts to adapt. But it is plainly absurd for Tory MP Owen Paterson to claim JLR would be in \u201ca wonderful position\u201d if the UK left the single market, customs union and jurisdiction of the European courts. Paterson\u2019s pre-politics commercial experience, according to his website, was gained at \u201chis family leather business\u201d, which you\u2019d think would encourage a little humility. A company producing 620,000 vehicles a year may just know more about the inner workings of the UK car industry. Sorrell seems to be the hardest word for WPP \u201cMartin I don\u2019t think needs to be reminded of his responsibilities and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll act appropriately,\u201d said WPP chairman Roberto Quarta at the advertising firm\u2019s annual meeting. His argument was that WPP shareholders shouldn\u2019t fret about the lack of a non-compete clause in departed chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s service contract because the separate confidentiality clauses would still be binding. That was less than a month ago, but WPP finds itself reaching for its lawyers already. Slaughter &amp; May has been summoned to fire off a stiff letter warning Sorrell that payouts to him worth up to \u00a320m could be cancelled if he continues his pursuit of MediaMonks, a Dutch production house that WPP also wants to buy. WPP\u2019s claim is that Sorrell was already involved in the potential deal, thought to be worth \u20ac300m (\u00a3265m), before he resigned in April and so he and his new S4 Capital outfit should be offside. There is no indication that Sorrell intends to back off. It\u2019s possible he is happy to risk the \u00a320m incentive, which is outcome-related and could be worth closer to \u00a310m in practice, to get his new venture off to a flyer. It seems more likely, however, that he thinks he is entirely within his rights to go after MediaMonks, in which case he will expect the first tranche of shares to be delivered on time next March. If it\u2019s the latter, WPP and Quarta are now duty bound to withhold the shares and say \u201csue us\u201d. That\u2019s something to look forward to.",

His argument was that WPP shareholders shouldn\u2019t fret about the lack of a non-compete clause in departed chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s service contract because the separate confidentiality clauses would still be binding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>That was less than a month ago, but WPP finds itself reaching for its lawyers already. Slaughter &amp; May has been summoned to fire off a stiff letter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jul/04/sir-martin-sorrell-to-raise-1bn-war-chest\">warning Sorrell</a> that payouts to him worth up to \u00a320m could be cancelled if he continues his pursuit of MediaMonks, a Dutch production house that WPP also wants to buy. WPP\u2019s claim is that Sorrell was already involved in the potential deal, thought to be worth \u20ac300m (\u00a3265m), before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/14/martin-sorrell-steps-down-as-head-of-wpp-advertising-agency\">he resigned</a> in April and so he and his new S4 Capital outfit should be offside.</p> <p>There is no indication that Sorrell intends to back off. It\u2019s possible he is happy to risk the \u00a320m incentive, which is outcome-related and could be worth closer to \u00a310m in practice, to get his new venture off to a flyer. It seems more likely, however, that he thinks he is entirely within his rights to go after MediaMonks, in which case he will expect the first tranche of shares to be delivered on time next March. If it\u2019s the latter, WPP and Quarta are now duty bound to withhold the shares and say \u201csue us\u201d. That\u2019s something to look forward to.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England has warned Donald Trump that further escalation of US trade disputes around the world would damage the America the most, as the world\u2019s largest economy and China prepare to launch the opening salvos of a trade war on Friday. Speaking hours before the world\u2019s top two economies prepare to launch tariffs on one another\u2019s imports, Mark Carney said further escalation would have serious and damaging consequences for global GDP. He cautioned that US growth could be hit by as much as 5%, compared with a slowdown for the rest of the world of up to half that amount. The intervention from the head of a G7 central bank against another member of the club of wealthy nations marks one of the boldest criticisms levelled against the US president so far. Speaking in Newcastle on Thursday, Carney said the current round of import tariffs from the US and retaliatory measures against the country, including spats with the EU, had already slowed the global economy. Carney believes any additional measures would have a significantly more damaging impact. He said: \u201cAt the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?\u201d He revealed forecasts made by Threadneedle Street showing the American economy would suffer a 2.5% drop in GDP as a result of falling trade volumes alone over three years, should the White House increase US import tariffs by about 10 percentage points on all of its trading partners. The world economy would take a hit to GDP of just over 1%, while there would be a smaller impact on the EU and the UK. The fallout from the scenario \u2013 akin to a full-scale trade war \u2013 would, however, be exacerbated by weaker levels of business investment and higher borrowing costs for companies as central banks raised interest rates, meaning the hit for growth could be doubled. \u201cThere is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a general tightening in global financial conditions,\u201d Carney said. Barring any last minute developments, the US and China will carry through their threats to impose $34bn (\u00a325.7bn) of import tariffs on Friday, from as early as one minute past midnight in Washington. The US tariffs will apply to a range of Chinese goods including nuclear reactors, boats and aircraft. The targets of tit-for-tat Chinese measures include soya beans, meat and cars. The anti-Chinese tariffs follow taxes imposed by the White House on steel and aluminium imports from the EU and other countries including Canada and Mexico. Brussels has hit back with tariffs on American consumer goods including whisky, Levi\u2019s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Trump has said the US could go one step further by imposing tariffs on European cars, which economists fear would do far greater damage than any of the existing measures. Carney said the impact from the president\u2019s use of import tariffs against major trading partners including the EU and China, alongside their retaliatory measures, was already being seen through measures of global exports and manufacturing in recent weeks. \u201cThere are some tentative signs that this more hostile and uncertain trading environment may be dampening activity,\u201d he said. Surveys of factory output in the US and the eurozone earlier this week showed firms were facing higher prices as a consequence of the import tariffs, as well as American manufacturers having the longest delivery delays on record. Alongside the threat of higher taxes on European cars, Carney said the US would have the highest import tariff regime for more than half a century. He said the impact of higher taxes and uncertainty over how the president will react next may have an adverse impact for business investment. Comparing the situation to a slowdown for firms ploughing money into the UK as Britain leaves the EU, he said: \u201cThe experience of Brexit underscores that the impact of global trade war will be greater the more business confidence is affected, the more financial conditions tighten and \u2013 most fundamentally \u2013 the more permanent the loss of openness is expected to be.\u201d China accused the US on Thursday of \u201copening fire\u201d on the world as both nations prepare to use import tariffs amid a long-running dispute over trade. Trump has previously accused the Asian country of using \u201cunfair\u201d trade practices, including anticompetitive support for the Chinese steel industry and the alleged theft of US firms\u2019 intellectual property. Trump has threatened to escalate the trade conflict between the two countries with tariffs worth as much as $450bn if China retaliates.",

      "bodyText": "Just two weeks ago, a convoy of vintage Land Rovers drove through Solihull to mark 70 years since the first model rolled off the production line at the Lode Lane plant. On Thursday the factory\u2019s 9,000 workers were waking up to the news that their boss had warned jobs could be under threat unless Theresa May struck a Brexit deal to \u201csafeguard\u201d its supply chain and extensive customer base in the EU. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before something bad happens, isn\u2019t it? We can\u2019t keep on being so lucky,\u201d said one worker as he headed for his shift at the West Midlands plant. Julie, 54, who has worked in the site\u2019s vast canteen said it would be devastating for Solihull if any part of the Jaguar Land Rover plant was wound down. \u201cIt\u2019s not just people who work here that it would affect, it\u2019s the drivers, the suppliers, the town relies on the factory.\u201d Others brushed off the concerns of Ralf Speth, JLR\u2019s German chief executive. \u201cLook at this,\u201d said an exhaust fitter pointing to a huge site that has a four-mile perimeter, a lake, a creche, two assembly lines and is by far the biggest employer in the area. \u201cThey have put billions into this and we hear all the time they are planning future investments on this site.\u201d Over a couple of hours of watching the site, 150 trucks shuttle in and out of the two large entrances. Some 10m components are brought in every day. There are vast car parks full of finished cars waiting for dispatch for export or for testing or washing. Joe, 52, who works on the site, didn\u2019t vote in the EU referendum. \u201cBut if I did I would have said leave.\u201d Even if it would have put your job at risk? \u201cYes, because it\u2019s not about jobs. It\u2019s about immigration.\u201d Over the road at the bus stop huddles of men were waiting for their buses home. \u201cThere are more rumours round here than there are stories in Coronation Street. You hear one thing one week and another another. You don\u2019t know what to believe. I just come in here, do a day\u2019s job, and get paid,\u201d Joe added. After crises and near closures during the darker decades of British industrial history, Solihull is now the biggest car plant in the country, producing 300,000 cars each year and responsible for tens of thousands of jobs indirectly and directly. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive employer. It gives us our big house \u2013 well bigger than the one I was in before \u2013 and the luxuries in life. Brexit is worrying,\u201d said Colin Smethurst, 31, as he heads for work. Many of those who spoke to the Guardian were men in their 20s, who had worked at the factory for four or five years. \u201cBrexit doesn\u2019t filter down to us on the tracks,\u201d said one referring to the production line.

      "bodyText": "Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has said a bad Brexit deal would cost the company more than \u00a31.2bn in annual profit. How is that possible? Disruption to importing and exporting components The car industry makes better use of the free and frictionless trade offered by Europe\u2019s single market than almost any other sector: every car that rolls off the production line in a UK plant is made up of tens of thousands of parts that between them will have made hundreds of thousands of movements across the continent. The leather chemicals and dyes used in making the seat trim sets for Jaguars and Land Rovers are sourced in Germany and Italy and imported to Scotland, where they are used to tan UK rawhides. The hides are then shipped to Poland, where they are cut and sewn into seat sets before being delivered \u2013 at the exact moment they are needed \u2013 to a UK JLR plant. Similarly, a seat frame starts with German steel being pressed into sub parts in the Czech Republic. Those parts are then painted and welded into a seat frame in the UK, assembled, and finally re-exported for fitting into a vehicle at the company\u2019s new facility in Nitra, Slovakia. The numbers involved are huge: JLR, which makes more than 600,000 cars a year, says it often has 10 trucks a day on each of the routes mentioned above in order to support production. More than 40% of its parts are imported from Europe. Tariff barriers Eight out of 10 cars manufactured in the UK are exported, so any financial cost on exports to the EU \u2013 whether of components or the finished product \u2013 is a challenge for the industry. A tariff is imposed by a country or an economic bloc on an import from overseas, and is calculated as a percentage of the value of the imported good. Industry experts calculate that falling back on World Trade Organization tariffs, if Britain leaves the EU without a free trade agreement, would add 10% to the cost of assembling a car in the UK. This is a significant sum in a low-margin business such as car manufacturing \u2013 enough to persuade some makers to consider setting up elsewhere. Ian Henry, an automative industry analyst, puts the total possible cost of post-Brexit tariffs for the UK car industry at up to \u00a33bn a year \u2013 of which JLR, which makes one in three cars exported from the UK, would bear roughly a third. Non-tariff barriers In any case, increased tariff barriers would not be the main impact of a bad Brexit deal. The biggest costs of doing business across borders tend to come from non-tariff barriers: rules-of-origin checks; customs controls; compliance with different different product standards and regulations between countries. These barriers do not exist as long as Britain is in the EU, and in order to remove them trade partners must agree on rules and regulations both can accept. The car industry has warned that as a minimum, it needs Britain to remain in the customs union with a deal that \u201cmaintains the benefits of the single market\u201d. Critically, any post-Brexit delays at UK and continental ports would also spell the end of just-in-time delivery, requiring major investment in labour and warehousing to stock all the goods that might arrive over a longer timeframe. Honda stores enough parts to keep its Honda Civic plant in Swindon going for 36 hours and would need a warehouse the size of 42 football pitches to last just nine days. JLR\u2019s Solihull plant makes 1,500 cars a day using 15m components; any delay to parts delivery would cost it \u00a31.25m an hour if it had to suspend production. Henry reckons the total cost of post-Brexit non-tariff barriers to the UK car industry could range from \u00a31.5bn to \u00a34.5bn a year \u2013 of which, again, JLR would bear about one-third. \u201cShort term, the impact of a bad Brexit deal will be a loss of sales \u2013 UK-made cars will be less competitive and prices will rise,\u201d he said. \u201cLonger term, there will be de-industrialisation. Not overnight, but it will happen.\u201d The car industry is one of the UK\u2019s leading employers, responsible for 856,000 jobs \u2013 186,000 of them on production lines. Frictionless borders could only be achieved through continued membership of the customs union and something resembling the single market, but this would limit the freedom Britain would have to negotiate other trade deals independently of the EU, a key Brexit goal.",

      "bodyText": "Shell, one of the world\u2019s biggest oil and gas companies, has backed calls for the UK to bring forward its 2040 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. Ben van Beurden, chief executive of the Anglo-Dutch group, said he welcomed the idea of bringing forward the ban, as it would provide clarity and make it easier for companies like Shell to make investment decisions and also shift consumer attitudes. Asked if he would like to see the ban take effect earlier, as MPs, mayors and thinktanks have called for, he said: \u201cIf you would bring it forward, obviously that would be welcome. I think the UK will have to go at a much higher speed than the speed the rest of the world can go.\u201d While Africa and Asia would out of necessity have to switch to battery vehicles at a slower rate, it would be welcome if the UK accelerated its plan, the executive told the Guardian. \u201cThe world will work at different speeds,\u201d he said. The rise of electric cars, which the government is banking on to displace conventional cars and cut air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, poses a double whammy for oil companies. As well as cutting demand for their main product \u2013 though how fast and how deeply is hotly disputed \u2013 the switch also threatens their petrol stations. Shell has responded by buying electric car infrastructure firms and beginning to install charging points on forecourts, while BP last week bought the UK\u2019s biggest electric-car charging network for \u00a3130m. Van Beurden said a lot of work was needed to cut emissions from transport, which in the UK has overtaken energy as the sector with the biggest carbon footprint. There are more than 140,000 plug-in cars in the UK, and about 2% of new car sales are electric. But the chief executive said pure electric cars were a \u201ctiny proportion\u201d of vehicles on the road. He was also strongly critical of the rise of climate change lawsuits being brought against oil companies. A Californian court recently dismissed a case against Shell brought by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland. This week Rhode Island became the first US state to launch a similar suit, suing Shell and other oil majors for their contribution to climate change\u2019s impact on the state. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of bizarre that the users of our products say, actually we don\u2019t want your product, why did you force it on us,\u201d said Van Beurden.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair cabin crew from four European countries will go on strike this month, in an escalation of the airline\u2019s labour dispute that is likely to cause severe disruption to flights to popular holiday destinations. Cabin and ground crew from Spain, Italy, Portugal and Belgium have agreed to stage a walkout on 25 and 26 July, saying Ryanair has failed to address a list of demands presented to the company in a \u201ccrew charter\u201d this week. Ryanair has described the demands as \u201cpointless\u201d, insisting its crew already enjoy good conditions. Details of the walkout emerged days after about 100 Ryanair pilots based in Ireland announced plans to strike on 12 July. Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, reversed a decades-old policy of refusing to recognise trade unions in December, as the airline wrestled with a pilot shortage that caused two waves of flight cancellations. But the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation, an umbrella body assisting Ryanair crew unions in multiple countries, said the company had not followed up union recognition with genuine talks about working conditions. ITF\u2019s campaigns director, Liz Blackshaw, said: \u201cThe decision that Ryanair took in December to recognise unions was welcomed, but that came in among years and years of complaints across the workforce about conditions, pay, all of the issues listed in the charter. \u201cNo progress has been made, despite Ryanair claiming to be in talks with unions across Europe. Ryanair needs to sit down with the unions they\u2019ve been talking with and actually address the conditions of work being complained about and address the charter.\u201d The crew charter drawn up by unions includes demands ranging from improvements to economic conditions to safety and rostering and workplace culture. They also urged Ryanair to end more precarious agency employment, give staff the right to sick pay and end strictly enforced sales targets for products such as scratchcards. Ryanair had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.",

Almost 235,000 new cars were registered last month compared with just over 243,000 during the same month last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.

      "bodyText": "Almost half of all unemployed people assisted by outsourced jobseeker services are still without a job after two years or more, and the most disadvantaged are waiting five years on average to exit the system. Those insights are contained in a jobs department discussion paper on government-funded employment services, which has been released as a harsh new penalty system for welfare recipients comes into force and amid concerns that a website outage has prevented jobseekers reporting their efforts to find work. The discussion paper paints a rosy picture of the Jobactive model, in which the government pays private companies to match employers with jobseekers, who undertake compulsory activities such as searching for work and attending job interviews to continue receiving welfare. It cited the fact jobseekers had found \u201cmore than 1 million\u201d placements since Jobactive began in 2015. \u201cThe labour market is strong, with over 12.5 million Australians in work, the highest on record,\u201d it said. \u201cThe proportion of the working age population receiving a welfare payment is now 15%, the lowest proportion it has been for at least 25 years.\u201d But the paper reveals that two-thirds of jobseekers receiving employment services are long-term unemployed who have been in the system for more than 12 months. \u201cAlmost half of the people in Jobactive have remained in the service for two years or more,\u201d it said. \u201cAmong the most disadvantaged jobseekers, the average length of time on the caseload is five years.\u201d The discussion paper blames the fact Jobactive employment service consultants have an average caseload of 148 jobseekers each. With a turnover rate for consultants \u201calmost three times the national average\u201d, it was \u201cdifficult to provide high-quality, tailored services to disadvantaged jobseekers\u201d, the paper said. \u201cSimilarly, employers may not always have access to the right incentives or support to hire these jobseekers.\u201d The discussion paper suggested technology such as a better website and digital applications would help \u201cmore efficient and targeted employment services\u201d. This would \u201cfree up more time for providers to spend servicing clients with higher needs and meeting the needs of employers\u201d. The paper suggested more \u201cautomated compliance reporting\u201d. This week the Jobactive website has had outages preventing jobseekers from reporting their search activities. One jobseeker, Kevin Searle, told Guardian Australia the website had been \u201cdown for days\u201d and \u201cappears to be a total failure\u201d because it did not display any activity reported since 6 April. The help desk has advised him to manually report his activity to his Jobactive provider. Labor\u2019s employment spokesman, Ed Husic, said jobseekers \u201cshould not be made to pay for another digital stuff-up by the government\u201d. \u201cThe government have been talking up the investment it is making in IT systems and it claims it is ready to release an online assessment tool for jobseekers, yet at the same its major site has crashed and has been out for days without adequate explanation,\u201d he said. A jobs department spokesman said a \u201cplanned shutdown\u201d had occurred from Friday to Sunday for an IT upgrade to support changes that came into effect on 1 July. \u201cA system issue has been identified which impacts how a jobseeker\u2019s job search effort indicator and job search effort periods are displayed on the dashboard and on the job search effort screen,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some circumstances it is preventing jobseekers from reporting their job search activity.\u201d The spokesman said that no data had been lost, jobseekers would not be required to re-enter their activities and would not be penalised. On Wednesday the Australian Unemployed Workers Union launched its Dump Your Demerits campaign in Sydney, lobbying against changes on 1 July that granted job agencies new powers to punish Newstart recipients for failing to perform compulsory activities. Under the new demerit point system, agencies can suspend payments if they believe jobseekers are behaving inappropriately, or failing to attend appointments and activities such as Work for the Dole without a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d. Jobseekers can no longer use drug or alcohol-related illnesses as a reasonable excuse and the job agencies\u2019 decision cannot be reviewed until the fifth demerit point is accrued. Senator Lee Rhiannon told the launch the Greens supported scrapping Work for the Dole and the demerit point system, which \u201cdemonises people who are unemployed, people who are on benefits\u201d. Rhiannon said that private companies could \u201cdish out demerit points\u201d resulting in jobseekers losing their entitlements, which would help the government by \u201cdriving people off welfare\u201d. Husic told Guardian Australia Labor was \u201cvery concerned there will be overzealous people more interested in pushing people off income support instead of tackling some of the serious and heavy social issues that might be preventing people reengaging in employment\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Almost half of all unemployed people assisted by outsourced jobseeker services are still without a job after two years or more, and the most disadvantaged are waiting five years on average to exit the system.</p> <p>Those insights are contained in a jobs department <a href=\"https://docs.jobs.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/the_next_generation_of_employment_services_discussion_paper_acc.pdf\">discussion paper</a> on government-funded employment services, which has been released as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/02/the-demerit-system-is-ruthless-social-policy-designed-to-keep-the-poor-powerless\">harsh new penalty system for welfare recipients</a> comes into force and amid concerns that a website outage has prevented jobseekers reporting their efforts to find work.</p> <p>The discussion paper paints a rosy picture of the Jobactive model, in which the government pays private companies to match employers with jobseekers, who undertake compulsory activities such as searching for work and attending job interviews to continue receiving welfare.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jun/19/with-unemployment-low-wages-will-start-growing-wont-they\">With unemployment low, wages will start growing \u2013 won't they? | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It cited the fact jobseekers had found \u201cmore than 1 million\u201d placements since Jobactive began in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cThe labour market is strong, with over 12.5 million Australians in work, the highest on record,\u201d it said. \u201cThe proportion of the working age population receiving a welfare payment is now 15%, the lowest proportion it has been for at least 25 years.\u201d</p> <p>But the paper reveals that two-thirds of jobseekers receiving employment services are long-term unemployed who have been in the system for more than 12 months.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost half of the people in Jobactive have remained in the service for two years or more,\u201d it said. \u201cAmong the most disadvantaged jobseekers, the average length of time on the caseload is five years.\u201d</p> <p>The discussion paper blames the fact Jobactive employment service consultants have an average caseload of 148 jobseekers each.</p> <p>With a turnover rate for consultants \u201calmost three times the national average\u201d, it was \u201cdifficult to provide high-quality, tailored services to disadvantaged jobseekers\u201d, the paper said.</p> <p>\u201cSimilarly, employers may not always have access to the right incentives or support to hire these jobseekers.\u201d</p> <p>The discussion paper suggested technology such as a better website and digital applications would help \u201cmore efficient and targeted employment services\u201d. This would \u201cfree up more time for providers to spend servicing clients with higher needs and meeting the needs of employers\u201d.</p> <p>The paper suggested more \u201cautomated compliance reporting\u201d. This week the Jobactive website has had outages preventing jobseekers from reporting their search activities.</p> <p>One jobseeker, Kevin Searle, told Guardian Australia the website had been \u201cdown for days\u201d and \u201cappears to be a total failure\u201d because it did not display any activity reported since 6 April.</p> <p>The help desk has advised him to manually report his activity to his Jobactive provider.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s employment spokesman, Ed Husic, said jobseekers \u201cshould not be made to pay for another digital stuff-up by the government\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe government have been talking up the investment it is making in IT systems and it claims it is ready to release an online assessment tool for jobseekers, yet at the same its major site has crashed and has been out for days without adequate explanation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A jobs department spokesman said a \u201cplanned shutdown\u201d had occurred from Friday to Sunday for an IT upgrade to support changes that came into effect on 1 July.</p> <p>\u201cA system issue has been identified which impacts how a jobseeker\u2019s job search effort indicator and job search effort periods are displayed on the dashboard and on the job search effort screen,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some circumstances it is preventing jobseekers from reporting their job search activity.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/14/unemployment-rate-falls-but-part-time-work-dominates-job-growth\">Unemployment rate falls but part-time work dominates job growth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The spokesman said that no data had been lost, jobseekers would not be required to re-enter their activities and would not be penalised.</p> <p>On Wednesday the Australian Unemployed Workers Union launched its Dump Your Demerits campaign in Sydney, lobbying against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/02/the-demerit-system-is-ruthless-social-policy-designed-to-keep-the-poor-powerless\">changes on 1 July that granted job agencies</a> new powers to punish Newstart recipients for failing to perform compulsory activities.</p> <p>Under the new demerit point system, agencies can suspend payments if they believe jobseekers are behaving inappropriately, or failing to attend appointments and activities such as Work for the Dole without a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d.</p> <p>Jobseekers can no longer use drug or alcohol-related illnesses as a reasonable excuse and the job agencies\u2019 decision cannot be reviewed until the fifth demerit point is accrued.</p> <p>Senator Lee Rhiannon told the launch the Greens supported scrapping Work for the Dole and the demerit point system, which \u201cdemonises people who are unemployed, people who are on benefits\u201d.</p> <p>Rhiannon said that private companies could \u201cdish out demerit points\u201d resulting in jobseekers losing their entitlements, which would help the government by \u201cdriving people off welfare\u201d.</p> <p>Husic told Guardian Australia Labor was \u201cvery concerned there will be overzealous people more interested in pushing people off income support instead of tackling some of the serious and heavy social issues that might be preventing people reengaging in employment\u201d.</p>",
