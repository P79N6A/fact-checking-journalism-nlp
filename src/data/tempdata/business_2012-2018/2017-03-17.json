      "bodyText": "Boom! The FTSE 100 has ended a busy week at a new all-time closing high. But it\u2019s only a modest rally - the blue-chip index has finished 9 points higher at 7424 points, adding to yesterday\u2019s record close. That\u2019s down on the new record high of 7447 set this afternoon. Insurance firm Admiral led the risers, up 2%, with medical products maker Convatec and budget airline easyJet close behind. European markets are showing some gains too. Germany\u2019s DAX also finished 0.1% higher, while the French CAC gained 0.3%. Investors have taken this week\u2019s US interest rate rise in their stride -- mainly because the Fed reassured them that borrowing costs won\u2019t rise too fast over the next couple of years Relief that the Dutch far-right \u2018only\u2019 came second in Wednesday\u2019s election also made for a good week in the City. But there is still plenty for investors to worry about this weekend; Brexit hasn\u2019t gone away, and nor have calls for another Scottish vote on independence. Plus, who knows what Donald Trump will do next week? His meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel is underway now, but looks a little awkward... Chris Beauchamp of IG reckons next week should be a little quieter than the last few days - although new UK inflation figures (on Tuesday) will be interesting. The coming week is a quieter one, at least compared to this one. UK CPI and retail sales will ensure that sterling remains a focus of attention, after the pound rallied from its lows thanks to the Fed meeting. However, it looks like we are in for a period of quiet, at least where events are concerned. Stocks remain expensive, but index inflows keep supporting the market, and for now there is no sign of a major dip emerging any time soon. So on that note, let\u2019s wrap up. Hope you have a lovely weekend. GW A gobbet of eurozone news: Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has just reaffirmed Portugal\u2019s credit rating, with a stable outlook: The OECD has put more pressure on governments to reform their economies, and help more people benefit from faster growth. Otherwise, the think tank warns, they will continue to lose the support and faith of voters. My colleage Katie Allen explains: The report, presented by OECD secretary general Angel Gurria at a meeting of finance ministers from the G20 group of nations in Germany calls on governments to take a long-term view of jobs and skills, infrastructure spending and innovation. It also calls for more focus on tackling inequality to win back public support for reforms. The group, which covers 35 mainly rich countries including the UK, notes that on average only 40% of OECD citizens trust their governments. Newsflash: US consumer confidence continues to grow. That\u2019s according to the University of Michigan, Its monthly consumer sentiment index has jumped to 97.6 in March, from 96.3 in February. And the \u2018current conditions\u2019 index, which asks people how their feel about their financial situation today, jumped by three points to 114.5, the highest reading since November 2000. The survey also found that Republicans were \u201cmuch more optimistic\u201d than Democrats about expectations for their finances. Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan consumer survey, says: The sentiment data has been characterised by rising optimism as well as by rising uncertainty due to the partisan divide. Optimism promotes discretionary spending, and uncertainty makes consumers more cautious spenders.\u201d The FTSE 100 is on track to set a closing high for the second day running (on top of this afternoon\u2019s intraday high). Henry Croft of Accendo Markets reckons investors are ending the week in good heart: \u201cEquity markets across the globe are positive as improved risk appetite continues into the weekend, although the pace of gains has slowed as drivers (data/corporate) are light on the ground. Investors are continuing to digest the multiple central bank monetary policy updates this week, including surprising hawkishness from the Bank of England [on Thursday]\u201d Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 just nudged a new alltime intraday high. The blue-chip index has hit the heady heights of 7447 points, up 30 points today - and two points higher than Thursday\u2019s peak. Royal Bank of Scotland, the financial institution bailed out by the taxpaper in 2008, is leading the rally - up 2.3% today. Ooooh. Bloomberg are reporting that the G20 finance chiefs have removed a reference to climate change from the statement they\u2019ll released on Saturday, at the end of their meeting. That\u2019s a blow to Germany, the meeting\u2019s host. It hoped to include a section about climate issues, but there appears to be a major disagreement over the issue. Bloomberg says: Deputies concluded crafting the communique on Thursday evening, and ministers and central-bank governors will debate the document in the German town of Baden-Baden on Friday. The language may still change before the final version is released the next day. Germany is using its year as G-20 president to push for the group to support climate protection. That effort has run into resistance from countries including the U.S., China, India and Saudi Arabia, one G-20 official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the talks were private. \u201cThere can be a way to overcome disagreements today -- that is, not writing about it in the communique,\u201d French Finance Minister Michel Sapin told reporters in the southwestern German spa town on Friday. \u201cBut not writing about it doesn\u2019t mean not talking about it. Not writing about it means that there are difficulties, that there is a disagreement and that we we must work on them in the coming months. Over in Baden-Baden, G20 finance ministers are trying to hammer out a statement on free trade. Germany\u2019s finance chief, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, told reporters that there were some \u201csensible positions\u201d among delegates on the issue \u201cI don\u2019t know the exact wording but nobody has raised the issue of protectionism yet and I don\u2019t believe that we have to deal with this a lot,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about finding the right wording, it\u2019s about how we phrase the openness of the world trade system in the final communique,.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) Lukman Otunuga of FXTM Research says the stock market bounce following Wednesday night\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting is fading. Traders were excited on Wednesday and Thursday that the Fed didn\u2019t predict more rate hikes in 2017 and 2018; today, though, they\u2019re more concerned about the G20 finance ministers meeting in Germany: Otunuga says: The \u201cdovish hike\u201d powered stock market rally slightly cooled off during Friday\u2019s trading session with investors turning cautious ahead of the anticipated G20 meeting. Asian shares were mostly mixed as participants weighed on the prospects of fewer US interest rates increases this year. In Europe, the defensive trading mood slightly pressured equities and the bearish contagion could limit gains on Wall Street this evening. An explosively volatile trading week is slowly coming to an end with investors turning their attention towards the G20 finance meeting which could offer some insights on how world leaders feel about key topics such as protectionism and global growth. With some discussions of currencies also being a possibility, the Greenback could turn volatile if leaders start to discuss the impacts of its resurgence since Trump\u2019s presidential victory. After a weak start, Europe\u2019s stock markets are now pushing higher. The FTSE 100 is up 19 points at 7435; a small rise, but only 10 points away from beating yesterday\u2019s all-time intraday high. After the excitement earlier this week (a US rate hike, a split at the Bank of England), the markets seem to be meandering towards the weekend. Connor Campbell of Spreadex says: Looking to the US open and the Dow Jones is set for a quiet start to the session, with the futures suggesting at 10 point rise when the bell rings on Wall Street. Now that the Fed rate raise is done and dusted the Dow may struggle to find any meaningful direction in the coming weeks \u2013 that is, of course, unless Donald Trump (who has been relatively quiet of late) unleashes some kind of market-shaking pronouncement. The eurozone has posted its first trade deficit in the years. Imported goods from the rest of the world surged by 17% year-on-year in January, to \u20ac164.5bn, according to Eurostat. Exports rose by 13% to \u20ac163.9bn. This left the euro area with a deficit of \u20ac600m; the first since January 2014. The wider European Union posted a trade in goods deficit of \u20ac16.2bn in January (partly due to Britain). That included a large trade deficit with China, but a larger surplus with the United States: High demand for energy in the winter months helped to cause Europe\u2019s trade deficit, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: Imports can also be lifted appreciably in the winter months if colder than usual weather leads to a pick-up in energy imports. However, the weakened traded goods performance in January will make it harder for net trade to contribute positively to Eurozone GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017 after being a drag in the fourth quarter of 2016. Donald Trump\u2019s man in Baden-Baden, Steven Mnuchin, has met with his Japanese counterpart Taro Aso: Mnuchin is expected to push G20 ministers not to deliberately weaken their currencies to win export business - something that Trump gets most irate about. But Aso may not appreciate any criticism; last month he denied that the yen was weak. Mark Carney is also warning that confidence in the financial sector, and trust in the markets, has been rocked by a series of scandals in recent years. In his letter to G20 finance chiefs, Carney says the Financial Stability Board is taking steps to make financial benchmarks more trustworthy (after a series of rigging scandals). It is also bolstering codes of conduct across the industry, and change financial institutions\u2019 governance and compensation structures to reduce misconduct risk. Carney also hints that simply slapping multi-billion fines on big banks isn\u2019t the only solution; individuals need to be held to account too. He says: The work recognises that, while fines and sanctions deter misconduct, preventative measures, including those which increase individual accountability, can also play important roles. The FSB is promising to: (i) deliver to G20 Leaders a report drawing together actions taken and recommendations made to address misconduct risk across the various elements of the action plan; and (ii) publish a consultation paper on the use of compensation tools to address misconduct The world\u2019s financial system risks suffer serious harm if policymakers fail to implement the measures drawn up to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis, Mark Carney has warned. Carney fired a \u2018hurry-up\u2019 towards the world\u2019s top finance ministers and central bankers as the G20 meeting got underway in Germany. He\u2019s pushing them to tackle \u2018shadow banking\u2019 (which takes place away from the regulators\u2019 gaze) and risky derivatives trading. He\u2019s acting in his role as head of the Financial Stability Board (the Bank of England governor is wearing two hats in Baden-Baden this weekend) He warned that there \u201ca risk of a loss of momentum\u201d in completing, and implementing, international standards. This could lead to fragmented funding and liquidity markets, driving up the cost of finance in the real economy. Carney concludes: A decade on from the start of the crisis, the G20 has made substantial progress in building a financial system that is more resilient and better able to fund households and business in sustainable way. As the global recovery gains strength, now is not the time to risk these hardwon gains. And here are the FSB\u2019s four priorities to avoid a repeat of the mayhem of 2008. Transforming shadow banking into resilient market-based finance, including by addressing structural vulnerabilities in asset management; Making derivatives markets safer by progressing the post-crisis reforms to over-the-counter derivatives markets and delivering coordinated guidance on central counterparty resilience, recovery and resolution; Supporting full and consistent implementation of post-crisis reforms, including the development of a structured framework for post-implementation evaluation of the effects of reforms; and Addressing new and emerging vulnerabilities, including misconduct risks, as well as those stemming from the decline in correspondent banking and from climate-related financial risks Some photos from the G20 meeting just landed: Almost five years after being forced out of Barclays over the Libor rate rigging scandal, Bob Diamond has made a dramatic return to the City. Diamond has pulled off an audacious takeover of City stockbrokers Panmure Gordon, through his Atlas Merchant Capital in an alliance with the Qatari royal family. They\u2019re paying a 68% premium for Panmure, which is one of the oldest brokerage in the Square Mile. Analysts believe Diamond could now turn Panmure into a \u2018boutique\u2019 investment bank. In the City, shares in housebuilder Berkeley Group have jumped by 6% this morning after it issued an upbeat trading statement. Profits will be at the top end of expectations, it said, despite a 16% drop in reservations since the Brexit vote. But Tullow Oil have slumped by 15%, after it announced plans for a \u00a3607m rights issue to tackle its debt burden. The cash call is priced at a 45% discount to last night\u2019s share price, prompting this morning\u2019s slide. Belgium\u2019s stock market is pluckily bucking the downward trend this morning: European stock markets have begun the day on the back foot. Germany\u2019s DAX is down 0.4% in early trading, as the country prepares to welcome finance ministers and central bank bosses from across the G20. That dragged the wider Stoxx 600 index down by 0.3%, with France and Spain also in the red. In London, the FTSE 100 dropped by 8 points after hitting a record closing high of 7415 last night. Henry Croft, Research Analyst at Accendo Markets, says political drama may drive the markets today: With this week\u2019s central bank updates and the Dutch election now in the rear view mirror, in focus today will be a multitude of high level political summits. The US President Donald Trump is hosting the German Chancellor President Angela Merkel, as the leader of the Eurozone\u2019s engine room meets face to face with the outspoken US chief for the first time since he took office. In Europe, Theresa May will address the Conservative Spring Forum around midday - expect \u2018Brexit means Brexit\u2019 soundbites aplenty and potentially some remarks towards the SNP - while the G20 meeting of Finance Ministers in Baden-Baden will likely be headlined by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin\u2019s first appearance on the global stage (trade in focus?) and, of course, the looming challenge of Brexit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders are enjoying a brighter commute to the office this morning. It\u2019s the Spring Equilux - when the days start being longer than the nights, and winter gloom becomes but a memory. However, this new extra daylight may be wasted on us today, as there\u2019s not too much actually going on. After rallying yesterday, European stock markets are expected to dip back this morning - as the boost from Wednesday\u2019s Dutch election fades. The economics calendar is a little sparse. 10am GMT: Eurozone trade balance for January 10am GMT: Eurozone construction output for January 2pm GMT: The US consumer confidence report from the University of Michigan 5pm GMT: The weekly Baker Hughes count of US oil rigs in operation Investors may also be watching Washington, where German chancellor Angela Merkel is meeting US president Donald Trump (her visit was delayed by heavy snow on Tuesday). And G20 finance ministers will begin their two-day meeting in Germany; protectionism and free trade will be high on the agenda. It\u2019s US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s first G20 meeting since taking office. RBC Capital Markets say: Mnuchin is expected to present a softer tone from the US, shying away from the protectionist message of Trump\u2019s campaign trail.",

Diamond\u2019s buyout vehicle, Atlas Merchant Capital, has teamed up with QInvest, the Qatari investment bank. to acquire Panmure Gordon. The deal marks a return to the Square Mile for an American banker whose high-flying career came to a halt in 2012 when he was forced to quit Barclays in the wake of the Libor rigging scandal. The then chancellor, George Osborne, described Diamond\u2019s resignation as \u201cthe right decision for Barclays \u2013 and for the country\u201d. Diamond \u2013 once branded the \u201cunacceptable face of banking\u201d by Lord Mandelson \u2013 is choosing one of the City\u2019s most venerable names for his comeback. Panmure Gordon was founded in 1876 and its alumni include David Cameron\u2019s late father, Ian, who was a senior partner at the firm. Panmure directors unanimously recommended the offer of \u00a31 per share, which values the company at \u00a315.5m. Atlas will control a majority stake, with QInvest maintaining its existing 43% stake. Diamond did not comment in a statement confirming the deal, but Matthew Hansen, boss of Atlas in the UK and Europe, said: \u201cWe believe there is significant opportunity for Atlas, in partnership with QInvest, to apply our operational skills and financial services expertise to enhance Panmure Gordon\u2019s strong reputation and build a larger, successful boutique investment bank. \u201cThis long-term stabilisation and development can only realistically be achieved as a private company, out of the glare of the public market and the effects of share price movement.\u201d Diamond is not expected to have a day-to-day role in the management of Panmure Gordon, with Hansen more directly involved in the deal from Atlas\u2019s side. A statement from the stockbroker said that its independent directors unanimously consider the offer price to be \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d. The deal requires the backing of a majority of shareholders, representing at least 75% of shares. It has already secured the support of investors owning 60% of its stock. Before he founded Atlas Merchant Capital, Diamond co-founded Atlas Mara, a London-listed investment vehicle focused on buying financial services businesses in Africa and with operations in seven countries. Diamond had big ambitions for Atlas Mara, which was part of a consortium that last year expressed interest in buying Barclays\u2019s African operations. Partners in the bid included the US private equity firm Carlyle and Atlas Mara indicated at the time that if the deal went ahead, it would likely be taken over by the consortium. However, the deal appears to have fallen by the wayside after Carlyle reportedly pulled out. Shares in Atlas Mara have fallen by about 80% since it listed in December 2013, and its chief executive John Vitalo stepped down last month. Vitalo had joined the company in 2014 as its first chief executive. Last month Atlas Merchant Capital announced its first European investment, teaming up with the ex-chief executive of Greek bank Piraeus to buy the Athens-based consumer finance arm of France\u2019s Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Governments must push through more fundamental reforms to boost growth, cut inequality and protect workers from rapid changes in technology if they are to win back the trust of voters, the west\u2019s leading economics thinktank has warned. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development says stagnating living standards in many countries have left people disenchanted and unwilling to support more changes by their governments in areas such as jobs markets. In its annual check on the pace of such reforms, the OECD says progress has slowed over the past five years and it warns governments to change tack or risk another protracted period of sluggish economic growth and damaging inequality For the UK, the OECD recommends greater spending on education and training to raise skills and boost productivity, which would in turn help raise wages. Better housing supply would improve labour mobility and reduce skill mismatches, resulting in additional income gains, it added. \u201cGovernments cannot afford to let up on reform if they want to escape the low-growth trap many of them are facing and to ensure that the gains of economic growth benefit the vast majority of citizens,\u201d the Going for Growth report says. It draws a strong link between that slow growth and lack of progress on reforms, noting that over the past two years, global growth has remained flat at about 3%, below the average growth rate of nearly 4% over the previous 10 years. The report, presented by OECD secretary general Angel Gurria at a meeting of finance ministers from the G20 group of nations in Germany calls on governments to take a long-term view of jobs and skills, infrastructure spending and innovation. It also calls for more focus on tackling inequality to win back public support for reforms. The group, which covers 35 mainly rich countries including the UK, notes that on average only 40% of OECD citizens trust their governments. \u201cAchieving greater inclusiveness and reducing inequalities of income and opportunities as well as poverty are important objectives for the well-being of citizens and winning back their trust. They are necessary for safeguarding social cohesion and sustaining growth in the longer run,\u201d said the report. The OECD\u2019s chief economist Catherine Mann said there had been some progress in recent years and governments had listened to her organisation\u2019s recommendations, notably with reforms that give young people and women more access to decent jobs. \u201cThe less good news is that progress on reforms related to longer term productivity growth, reforms in that area have slowed down,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s bad news because ultimately productivity growth is the wherewithal by which we have higher living standards in the longer term.\u201d Mann said one factor slowing the pace of reform was slow economic growth itself. \u201cThere has been a bit of a hunkering down by labour, you can understand that. \u2018I don\u2019t want to change my job because I don\u2019t see any other ones out there.\u2019 You\u2019ve got businesses saying \u2018Why should I change what I am doing, I don\u2019t see a lot of sales happening\u2019.\u201d The OECD\u2019s flgaship annual report is designed to help policymakers come up with effective reform packages to boost economic growth. This year, for the first time, it has added \u201cinclusive growth\u201d as a goal. Mann said that decision preceded the votes for Brexit in the UK and Donald Trump in the US presidential race, interpreted by many commentators as electorates voicing their frustration at inequality. \u201cIt was January and February 2016 when we committed to broadening the scope of growth to productivity, employment and inclusivity,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we were in advance of Brexit, we were in advance of the Trump vote. But we understood at the time that there were these growing concerns about the distribution of growth and that we had to take that on full force.\u201d The report\u2019s recommendations on cutting inequality include telling governments to ensure people get the training they need and are able to move into jobs that match their skills. Amid fears that many jobs are at risk of being replaced by computers and robots, the OECD also said that workers, business managers and governments needed better skills and knowledge to keep pace with innovation.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Anti-corruption campaigners have demanded a criminal investigation in India into a businessman and major Liberal Democrat donor over his alleged links to the Rolls-Royce bribery scandal. In a letter to India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation, the lawyer and politician Prashant Bhushan asked that the country\u2019s authorities launch an investigation into the role of Sudhir Choudhrie and other middlemen for the British engineering giant. Bhushan wrote: \u201cAs per the British media reports, one Sudhir Choudhrie, who figures in the list of Undesirable Contact Men prepared by your department, and his son Bhanu were arrested by the Serious Fraud Office [SFO], UK in February 2014 for their alleged involvement as middlemen for Rolls-Royce in various contracts for procurement by Indian defence forces.\u201d He also noted: \u201cRolls-Royce has apparently paid over \u00a310m to Sudhir Choudhrie for securing the Hawk contract.\u201d In January, Rolls-Royce agreed to pay \u00a3671m in penalties to settle long-running bribery investigations by the SFO and overseas prosecutors, but separate criminal inquiries may follow in countries around the world where the company has admitted corruption. The Guardian and the BBC\u2019s Panorama have previously revealed that Choudhrie family companies were paid millions by Rolls-Royce for their work in India. Since leaving India and moving to London, Sudhir and Bhanu have become major supporters of the Lib Dems, with family members and companies giving the party more than \u00a31.6m over the years, according to figures released by the Electoral Commission. Sudhir Choudhrie gave \u00a3200,000 last year alone, including \u00a350,000 in December. He also financed Tim Farron\u2019s leadership bid in 2015 and has since been nominated as the party\u2019s adviser on India. Bhushan\u2019s letter added that if the Central Bureau of Investigation did not start an investigation, he and other activists would begin public interest litigation, a form of civil legal proceedings designed to address issues of broad public concern. Lawyers for Sudhir and Bhanu Choudhrie declined to comment. Neither of them have been charged since the 2014 arrest. They have previously stated: \u201cThe allegation that Rolls-Royce paid Mr Choudhrie and his son to secure deals for Rolls-Royce in India, including the sale of Hawk jets to the Indian government is false.\u201d In a letter, the Choudhries\u2019 lawyers had said: \u201cMr Choudhrie has never paid bribes to government officials or acted as an illegal \u2018middleman\u2019 in defence deals.\u201d Sudhir Choudhrie has challenged the authenticity of the \u201cUndesirable Contact Men\u201d list. According to rules in India, foreign defence contractors are barred from paying middlemen for certain work. If a company is found to have breached the rules, it can be barred from working in India for at least five years and hit with fines. Robert Buckland, the solicitor general, recently told parliament that the SFO would cooperate with \u201ctrusted partners\u201d in overseas investigations into Rolls-Royce. He said: \u201cThe SFO will continue to treat any requests for mutual legal assistance from overseas authorities that may be connected to this investigation, in line with UK government policy and international convention.\u201d Bhushan said: \u201cI hope that the Serious Fraud Office will share their information with police forces around the world. I think that everywhere that they found corruption, they should assist the investigations into crime so that people can be brought to justice.\u201d When asked about Sudhir and Bhanu Choudhrie, a spokesman for the Lib Dems said: \u201cWhen carrying out due diligence on potential and current donors the party goes beyond what is asked of it by the Electoral Commission. As much as is reasonably possible we review the business and public activities of potential and current donors to ensure they are in keeping with the values of the Liberal Democrats.\u201d Sue Hawley, of the UK-based anti-bribery campaign Corruption Watch, supported the demand for a criminal investigation in India. She said: \u201cIt is essential that the intermediaries who played a role in Rolls-Royce\u2019s vast web of bribery are properly investigated and brought to book. Only then will the full details of this scandal emerge and justice be done.\u201d The Guardian has previously revealed that Rolls-Royce had hired a network of agents to help it land contracts in at least 12 countries. Labour and Conservative administrations have forged close relations with Rolls-Royce and have often lobbied foreign governments to give large export contracts to the manufacturer.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The housing minister, Gavin Barwell, has told the world\u2019s housebuilders that if they cannot find enough land on which to build new homes they can \u201ccome and see me\u201d and he will try to help. Barwell told developers at the world\u2019s biggest property conference in Cannes on Thursday that he wanted to be \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d that he was there to help them build hundreds of thousands of new homes to help fix the UK\u2019s housing crisis. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got parts of the country where you want to build homes and you\u2019re struggling to find land, you come and see me and I will then raise those issues with the relevant local authorities,\u201d he told investors at the UK government\u2019s first promotional stand on the famous waterfront in the south of France. \u201cI don\u2019t want people who want to build unable to do so because they can\u2019t find the sites they want. \u201cThat\u2019s an offer to anyone in this room \u2013 if you\u2019re struggling to find sites you [can] come talk to me and I\u2019ll try and do something about it.\u201d Barwell said the government was committed to building more homes that families desperately needed and to releasing enough land for 160,000 new properties. In promotional leaflets handed to developers and investors, the prime minister, Theresa May, said the UK was \u201copen for business\u201d and was \u201cmore committed than ever to creating the most business-friendly environment possible\u201d. May said \u201cattracting investors to the whole of the UK\u2019s real estate\u201d would be a key driver of the UK economy in the post-Brexit world. \u201cAs we leave the European Union, I am determined that we will seize the opportunity to forge a bold new role for a global Britain as the most outward-looking, free-trading nation in the world,\u201d she said. Officials said Britain had its biggest presence yet at the Mipim conference, with its adverts dominating the entrance to the conference centre. Cities including London, Manchester and Leeds, along with the Midlands and dozens of other regions and local authorities spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on stands to try to attract investment from global developers and investment funds. Barwell told property industry figures that he wanted to \u201cchange the politics\u201d of housebuilding so that local people did not automatically protest at the suggestion of new construction. The Croydon MP also vowed to have \u201chard discussions\u201d with local politicians who held up development. Barwell said he would try to make sure housebuilding projects came with fresh infrastructure investments to allow communities to cope with additional residents. He also said more needed to be done to ensure newbuild homes were of good quality and design. \u201cPeople welcome homes that are really innovative in design, or fit in with the local area,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t like are homes that look like they could have been plonked down in any area of the country.\u201d Liam Fox, secretary of state for international trade, said the creation of a dedicated UK government pavilion at Cannes was a recognition of the \u201cgreat changes and opportunities that exist for the real estate sector following the British electorate\u2019s decision to exit the European Union\u201d. In prepared remarks, he said the Department for International Trade would help overseas investors by \u201cfacilitating flows of foreign capital into investment opportunities across the whole of the country\u201d. \u201cMipim is an important opportunity to showcase the wide range of investment opportunities that exist across the UK, from Southampton to Edinburgh, Coventry to Swansea and key sectors from tech to creative,\u201d Fox said. \u201cIt shows investors both within the UK and from overseas understand the scale of our ambition and the role they can play in achieving it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe entered the quarter with deflation and exited the quarter with inflation,\u201d declared Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, describing shop prices in the most recent trading period. Once upon a time, this would have been taken as excellent news for shareholders, as opposed to customers. Inflationary breezes, allowing prices to be raised faster than overheads, used to be a supermarket\u2019s best friend and surest way to protect profit margins. Not now. Coupe didn\u2019t give a figure for price inflation at Sainsbury\u2019s, but it is unlikely to be as high as he \u2013 and his competitors \u2013 would wish. Industry consultant Kantar put the rate at 1.4% last month. That was double the rate in the previous month, but we\u2019re not talking about the 5% within six months that his predecessor, Justin King, forecast four months ago for the entire industry. King\u2019s argument was that, since 40% to 50% of food in supermarkets is imported, a 5% increase in prices would be required to compensate for the 10% fall in the pound since the referendum. King\u2019s figure will almost certainly arrive in time, one suspects, but not within his six-month horizon. Instead, supermarkets are having to take much of the inflationary hit on the chin. As Coupe said: \u201cThe market remains very competitive and the impact of cost price pressures remains uncertain.\u201d Put another way, discounters Aldi and Lidl \u2013 who weren\u2019t forces in the land during previous sterling devaluations \u2013 lie in wait for any supermarket that thinks it can help itself to a currency-inspired price rise. Supermarkets\u2019 share prices, becalmed as the overall stock market marches upwards, tell the story. Inflation was great for supermarkets only when competition was weaker. Life has changed. In Sainsbury\u2019s case, the acquisition of Argos, where like-for-like sales rose 4.3%, looks smarter by the month. The timing was sound. But the supermarkets, where sales were flat, are on a tough treadmill. Energy has enough power to take the pain Those MPs who spent Thursday beating up the big energy suppliers in parliament may also note the supermarkets\u2019 experience. In the electricity and gas market, price increases are being blamed on different factors \u2013 rising wholesale prices and the cost of programmes to upgrade infrastructure \u2013 but the seemingly mechanical nature of the hikes is striking. Even if one concedes (many wouldn\u2019t) that the energy market is competitive, it would be hard to argue that it\u2019s as competitive as food retailing. It is a point the government, preparing a green paper on protecting the interests of consumers, may care to make when the Big Six next protest that their price rises were forced by factors beyond their control. It is not against the rules to counter those forces and take a bit of short-term pain yourself. Balfour Beatty tastes benefits of reconstruction In 2014, Balfour Beatty was deemed in some quarters to be such a mess that a takeover by rival Carillion would be an act of mercy. Balfour had issued umpteen profit warnings and Carillion, lobbying for an all-share deal, was regarded as the sector\u2019s slickest operator. Three years on, Balfour\u2019s shareholders should give thanks the takeover didn\u2019t happen. Their company\u2019s recovery continues while Carillion\u2019s share price has sunk by a third. It would be exaggeration to say Leo Quinn, the outsider recruited to cure Balfour\u2019s many ailments, has completed the task. Even in a low-margin business like construction, making an operating profit of \u00a367m on revenues of \u00a38.5bn does not count as success. But it is true that a dose of common sense, after Balfour\u2019s grim chapter of over-bidding for contracts, has made a difference. Quinn pledged to improve the cash position by \u00a3200m in the first two years while removing \u00a3100m of costs. In the event, he reported \u00a3439m and \u00a3123m respectively. The way he tells it, the trick was to make 45 businesses, accumulated during Balfour\u2019s old acquisition spree, into one. \u201cA federated culture had resulted in layers of unnecessary cost and a tendency for elements of the business to compete with one another,\u201d he says. Balfour now has one IT director instead of 14. True success will arrive only when Balfour delivers the \u201cindustry standard\u201d profit margins Quinn talks about. The target is by the end of next year. If standard means 2.5%, profits would pass \u00a3200m on current revenues, which would be a proper improvement. The morale of the 2014 episode seems simple. In a business such as construction, where contracts rarely run for longer than two or three years and the poison can flushed out of the system quite quickly, it is usually better to fix a troubled business than to sell it in a weak moment.",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets across Europe soared as traders reacted to the defeat of an anti-EU candidate in Dutch elections and the latest interest rate announcement from the US central bank. The Federal Reserve accompanied its latest rate rise this week with guidance that it would not tighten policy quite as much as financial markets anticipated this year. That message buoyed share prices, adding to the upbeat mood prompted by the results of parliamentary elections in the Netherlands. Amsterdam\u2019s stock index jumped to a nine-year high after the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, successfully fought off the challenge of the populist Geert Wilders. His victory helped to buoy shares in other European markets as it allayed fears of a tide of nationalist sentiment spreading across the continent, undermining the eurozone and its economy. The UK\u2019s main bluechip index, the FTSE 100, clocked up a new all-time high and the main indices in France and Germany closed at their highest levels since mid-2015. Analysts said investor focus would now turn to the forthcoming French presidential election and Brexit negotiations, but that the Dutch result had helped sentiment for now. \u201cA cloud of uncertainty has been blown away overnight,\u201d said Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at the online trading company IG. \u201cThe loss of Dutch populist Geert Wilders comes as a huge boost to the EU and eurozone, which will now begin to shift its attention to the enactment of article 50, followed by next month\u2019s French election.\u201d The latest news from the US Federal Reserve was also a key factor in market moves. The central bank raised borrowing costs in the world\u2019s biggest economy for the second time in three months on Wednesday, taking the base rate from 0.75% to 1%. It toned down previous guidance on future rises though, and that weakened the dollar. The fall in the US currency helped to power a rally in commodity prices, which boosted the many mining stocks in the FTSE 100. . Glencore, Antofagasta and Rio Tinto were among the top risers as the index closed up 47 points, or 0.6%, at a new high of 7,415.95. Anglo American was the biggest gainer, however, closing up almost 9% after the Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal said he was buying a \u00a32bn stake. In the US, shares had drifted lower by the London close. The healthcare sector was under particular pressure from proposed changes under Donald Trump\u2019s administration that look set to raise companies\u2019 regulatory costs. Shares in the luxury winter jacket retailer Canada Goose rose on their first day of trading, jumping to $18.40 at one point, well above the initial public offering price of $12.78.",

His victory helped to buoy shares in other European markets as it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/16/europes-governments-signal-relief-as-dutch-election-defeats-far-right\">allayed fears of a tide of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/16/europes-governments-signal-relief-as-dutch-election-defeats-far-right\">nationalist sentiment spreading across the continent</a>, undermining the eurozone and its economy.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s main bluechip index, the FTSE 100, clocked up a new all-time high and the main indices in France and Germany closed at their highest levels since mid-2015. Analysts said investor focus would now turn to the forthcoming French presidential election and Brexit negotiations, but that the Dutch result had helped sentiment for now.</p> <p>\u201cA cloud of uncertainty has been blown away overnight,\u201d said Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at the online trading company IG. \u201cThe loss of Dutch populist Geert Wilders comes as a huge boost to the EU and eurozone, which will now begin to shift its attention to the enactment of article 50, followed by next month\u2019s French election.\u201d</p> <p>The latest news from the US Federal Reserve was also a key factor in market moves. The central bank raised borrowing costs in the world\u2019s biggest economy for the second time in three months on Wednesday, taking the base rate from 0.75% to 1%. It toned down previous guidance on future rises though, and that weakened the dollar.</p> <p>The fall in the US currency helped to power a rally in commodity prices, which boosted the many mining stocks in the FTSE 100. . Glencore, Antofagasta and Rio Tinto were among the top risers as the index closed up 47 points, or 0.6%, at a new high of 7,415.95. Anglo American was the biggest gainer, however, closing up almost 9% after the Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal said he was buying a \u00a32bn stake.</p> <p>In the US, shares had drifted lower by the London close. The healthcare sector was under particular pressure from proposed changes under Donald Trump\u2019s administration that look set to raise companies\u2019 regulatory costs. </p> <p>Shares in the luxury winter jacket retailer Canada Goose rose on their first day of trading, jumping to $18.40 at one point, well above the initial public offering price of $12.78.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Gig economy companies trying to have their cake and eat it, say workers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Companies operating in the gig economy are \u201chaving their cake and eating it\u201d by treating workers like staff while avoiding the tax and regulations on employing people on full-time contracts, according to a study. A survey of workers in the gig economy found that most believed their employers were exploiting a lack of regulation to grow quickly. Almost two-thirds said the government should step in to guarantee basic employment rights. The survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, the trade body for human resources staff, found that although workers are classified as self-employed, many were concerned about the level of control exerted over them by the businesses they worked for. \u201cThis is supported by the data, as just four in 10 gig economy workers, or 38%, say that they feel like their own boss, which raises the question of whether some are entitled to more employment rights,\u201d the report said. The gig economy has become a focus of concern following the commercial success of companies such as Amazon, the ride hailing firm Uber and the delivery service Deliveroo. These companies employ workers on short-term contracts that can last just a few hours, allowing them to avoid paying employers national insurance, sickness and holiday pay. Earlier this week the chancellor reversed an increase in national insurance on self-employed workers after critics, many on the Tory backbenches, said it was a tax on the gig economy and budding entrepreneurs. The CIPD, however, found that most people it classified as gig economy workers were permanent employees, students or unemployed people taking jobs to top up their incomes and accepting hourly pay rates averaging between \u00a36 and \u00a37.70 an hour. Peter Cheese, the CIPD\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOur research suggests that some gig economy businesses may be seeking to have their cake and eat it by using self-employed contractors to cut costs, while at the same time trying to maintain a level of control over people that is more appropriate for a more traditional employment relationship. \u201cMany people in the gig economy may already be eligible for basic employment rights, but are confused by the issue of their employment status. It is crucial that the government deals with the issue of employment status before attempting to make sweeping changes, else they risk building foundational changes on shifting sands.\u201d The CIPD said its survey of more than 5,000 people found that 4% of the working-age population, or 1.3 million people, operated in the gig economy, lower than the 5 million estimated in some studies, though these include people on zero-hours contracts, eBay traders and people who rent out their homes through online apps lsuch as Airbnb. The CIPD said gig economy workers were individuals \u201cwho have used an online platform at least once in the last 12 months\u201d to provide transport using their own vehicle, rent out their own vehicle, deliver food or goods, or perform short-term jobs using online platforms such as TaskRabbit, Upwork or PeoplePerHour. The report, To Gig or Not To Gig: Stories from the modern economy, also found that only 14% of respondents said they did gig work because they could not find alternative employment. The most common reason for taking on gig work was to boost income, which accounted for 32% of responses. Overall, gig economy workers are also about as likely to be satisfied with their work (46%) as other workers in more traditional employment (48%). The report said: \u201cDespite the typically low earnings reported by gig economy workers, they remain on the whole satisfied with their income, with 51% saying they are satisfied and 19% dissatisfied with the level of income they receive. This is significantly higher than the level of satisfaction with pay reported by other workers, where 36% are satisfied and 35% are dissatisfied.\u201d",

Almost two-thirds said the government should step in to guarantee basic employment rights.</p> <p>The survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, the trade body for human resources staff, found that although workers are classified as self-employed, many were concerned about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2017/mar/11/now-we-should-go-after-companies-force-workers-self-employed\">level of control exerted over them by the businesses they worked for</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/17/uber-exploiting-loophole-to-spread-tentacles-across-uk-gmb-union-says\">Uber exploiting loophole to 'spread tentacles' across UK, union says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is supported by the data, as just four in 10 gig economy workers, or 38%, say that they feel like their own boss, which raises the question of whether some are entitled to more employment rights,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The gig economy has become a focus of concern following the commercial success of companies such as Amazon, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/05/am-i-being-uber-touchy-ethics-minicab-app\">ride hailing firm Uber</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/03/restaurant-takeaway-delivery-boom-uk-deliveroo-ubereats-food\">delivery service Deliveroo</a>. These companies employ workers on short-term contracts that can last just a few hours, allowing them to avoid paying employers national insurance, sickness and holiday pay.</p> <p>Earlier this week the chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/15/philip-hammond-ditches-national-insurance-rise-for-self-employed\">reversed an increase in national insurance on self-employed workers </a>after critics, many on the Tory backbenches, said it was a tax on the gig economy and budding entrepreneurs.</p> <p>The CIPD, however, found that most people it classified as gig economy workers were permanent employees, students or unemployed people taking jobs to top up their incomes and accepting hourly pay rates averaging between \u00a36 and \u00a37.70 an hour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/05/am-i-being-uber-touchy-ethics-minicab-app\">Uber is smart, simple and seductive. But should we still be using it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Peter Cheese, the CIPD\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOur research suggests that some gig economy businesses may be seeking to have their cake and eat it by using self-employed contractors to cut costs, while at the same time trying to maintain a level of control over people that is more appropriate for a more traditional employment relationship. <br></p> <p>\u201cMany people in the gig economy may already be eligible for basic employment rights, but are confused by the issue of their employment status. It is crucial that the government deals with the issue of employment status before attempting to make sweeping changes, else they risk building foundational changes on shifting sands.\u201d</p> <p>The CIPD said its survey of more than 5,000 people found that 4% of the working-age population, or 1.3 million people, operated in the gig economy, lower than the 5 million estimated in some studies, though these include people on zero-hours contracts, eBay traders and people who rent out their homes through online apps lsuch as Airbnb.</p> <p>The CIPD said gig economy workers were individuals \u201cwho have used an online platform at least once in the last 12 months\u201d to provide transport using their own vehicle, rent out their own vehicle, deliver food or goods, or perform short-term jobs using online platforms such as TaskRabbit, Upwork or PeoplePerHour.</p> <p>The report, To Gig or Not To Gig: Stories from the modern economy<em>,</em> also found that only 14% of respondents said they did gig work because they could not find alternative employment. The most common reason for taking on gig work was to boost income, which accounted for 32% of responses. </p> <p>Overall, gig economy workers are also about as likely to be satisfied with their work (46%) as other workers in more traditional employment (48%). </p> <p>The report said: \u201cDespite the typically low earnings reported by gig economy workers, they remain on the whole satisfied with their income, with 51% saying they are satisfied and 19% dissatisfied with the level of income they receive. This is significantly higher than the level of satisfaction with pay reported by other workers, where 36% are satisfied and 35% are dissatisfied.\u201d</p>",
