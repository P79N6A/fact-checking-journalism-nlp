    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Cyber Monday isn\u2019t over yet but it already looks poised to set a record this year, with early indications that online sales have grown 14% and leading retail websites including Target crashing temporarily, seemingly overwhelmed by high customer traffic. Sales are expected to reach a record $3bn for the first time ever, a 50% increase from $2bn in sales reached on Cyber Monday three years ago. As shoppers flocked to websites to snap up some of the best deals of the year, they encountered outages and slow checkouts. Visitors to Target\u2019s website were among those experiencing delays. On Monday morning, the company said its online traffic was already twice as high as its busiest day ever. The site remained working, if slower than usual. \u201cAs we experience spikes in traffic, our systems place guests in a queue,\u201d a Target spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe apologize to guests who experience any delays, we appreciate their patience, and encourage them to try again in a few minutes by refreshing their browser.\u201d Similar technical difficulties were reported during the five-day shopping spree starting on Thanksgiving by PayPal, department store chain Neiman Marcus, Walmart, Victoria\u2019s Secret and Foot Locker. Sales on Cyber Monday, the busiest day of the year for internet shopping, were up 14% from a year earlier at $490m between midnight and 10am ET, according to Adobe Digital Index, part of Adobe Systems Inc, which provides digital marketing and media solutions to merchants. Adobe tracked 80% of all online transactions from the top 100 US retailers and said sales are on track to meet its expectation of a record $3bn by the end of the day. The 14% boost on Monday is equivalent to the 14% jump in sales that Adobe recorded for Black Friday online shopping, when it tracked the activity of 4,500 retail websites. The change from last year can be attributed to the avalanche of email promotions. According to Adobe, email promotions drove 25% more sales than in 2014. \u201cConsumers are hyped for Cyber Monday, with social buzz more positive than what we saw on Black Friday, but they need to brace themselves for the highest out-of-stock rates of the season so far,\u201d said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst at Adobe Digital Index. Adobe said 15 of 100 product views were returning an out-of-stock message this morning, two and a half times the normal rate. The data underscored the ongoing shift in shopping to online retailers. The record sales come days after traditional Black Friday sales fell by 10%. According to ShopperTrack, sales in 2015 came out to $10.4bn, down from $11.6bn in 2014. This is not the first year that the traditional Black Friday haul took a hit. Last year, according to the National Retail Federation, sales were down 11% compared to 2013. Some analysts have blamed the drop in sales over the holidays on better deals offered days, if not weeks, in advance both online and in stores. Some stores such as Macy\u2019s have begun opening their doors on Thanksgiving; Radio Shack said this year it would offer its deals on Wednesday; and Amazon, the world\u2019s largest retailer, began offering some deals as early as 20 November, a week in advance. An estimated 60% of US consumers \u2013 a record number \u2013 started their holiday shopping before Thanksgiving this year, the National Retail Federation found. As a result, sales on Thanksgiving also dropped this year by the same percentage as those on Black Friday, to $1.8bn. On Monday, department stores whose share prices had already declined recently, due to low expectations going into the last two months of 2015, fell further. Shares of Macy\u2019s were down 2.7% , Nordstrom were down 2.2%, Kohl\u2019s stock was down 3% and Walmart shares were down 1.4% on Monday. For the year, Macy\u2019s stock has now plummeted 41% while Nordstrom is down 24%. Even online shopping heavyweight Amazon.com, which should benefit from the internet shopping trend, was down 0.4% at $670.38. \u201cIn the short term, players are saying \u2018Hey, this is not what I positioned myself for,\u2019\u201d said Frank Davis, director of sales and trading at LEK Securities in New York. \u201cThey thought maybe we\u2019d get a bit of a pop, but that hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d Between Thanksgiving and Sunday, $8.03bn was spent online, a 17% increase from 2014, Adobe said. The average shopper spent $135.25, up 4% from a year ago. Mobile, which includes phones and tablets, accounted for 53% of shopping visits driving 32% of online sales, the data showed. IBM has predicted Cyber Monday online sales will grow by more than 18% compared to 2014. Reuters contributed to this report.",

    "webTitle": "Your mission at Barclays, Jes Staley, should you choose to accept it", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Welcome to Barclays, Jes Staley, you have been hired to add the ill-defined quality of dynamism, or so your chairman suggested when he fired your predecessor as chief executive, Antony Jenkins. It\u2019s not clear what this mission is meant to involve, other than shedding staff and overheads at a faster pace than Jenkins could manage, but here\u2019s one area where Barclays would benefit from less dynamism, not more: relations with regulators. You need to know that your new employer has a tendency to surround the referee to argue the toss when it doesn\u2019t like a decision. It\u2019s not a good way to behave and, more to the point, the tactic usually doesn\u2019t work. Jenkins got off on the wrong foot. Back in 2013 he said Barclays might be forced to cut lending to the UK economy if the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) insisted on seeing a rapid improvement in the bank\u2019s leverage ratios. The suggestion-cum-threat caused uproar and, if it was intended to reassure shareholders, it backfired. Within months, Barclays launched a \u00a35.8bn rights issue. Unfortunately, your new chairman, John McFarlane, has also acquired a reputation for quarrelling over rules he doesn\u2019t like, such as ringfencing, the requirement for banks to erect an internal division between their investment banking and retail divisions by 2019. \u201cThere is a serious question as to whether all these statutory and regulatory changes are really necessary,\u201d he told the Sunday Times in May. Such complaints may have succeeded in watering down a few minor new rules but the ring-fence itself will be a fact of life. It has been approved by parliament and the PRA is clear it will stamp on any restructuring proposal from a bank that seeks to dodge the spirit of the rules. Indeed, the complaints have only succeeded in opening a separate debate about banks\u2019 lobbying tactics \u2013 Barclays, note, got a dishonourable mention at the Treasury select committee a fortnight ago. Circumspection is required, Mr Staley, especially from a bank that was whacked with yet another big fine last week. Ringfencing presents particular headaches for banks like Barclays with big investment operations \u2013 but you are paid the big bucks to find solutions, not to irritate regulators. Dividend cut looks inevitable at BHP Billiton As with BP after its Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, the City has been slow to wake up to the scale of BHP Billiton\u2019s catastrophe in Brazil \u2013 the dreadful dam failure at Samarco on 5 November, which killed 13 people and left six still unaccounted for. Yesterday, BHP confirmed the Brazilian government is suing for $5.2bn for environmental recovery and compensation. Samarco is owned by BHP and Brazilian mining group Vale and, if a half-share of $5.2bn was the eventual bill, investors might be inclined to see value in a share price that has fallen by about 25% since the disaster. In reality, it\u2019s too soon to make that call. Bills invariably rise after major mining and natural resources incidents and it\u2019s not clear what other claims the Brazilian government, or regional authorities, will submit. As with BP, final resolution could take years. The only near certainty is that BHP will cut a dividend currently costing $6.5bn a year. The payment was surely unsustainable anyway, given the fall in commodity prices, and thus BHP\u2019s profits, but Samarco ends any pretence. From a purely financial perspective, BHP could probably get away with halving the payment to shareholders. In practice, it should be guided by Vale, which is a core holding for Brazilian pension funds. If its joint-venture partner judges any form of dividend to be too politically inflammatory, BHP should follow its lead. Aberdeen Asset Management must allow pain to pass \u201cWe believe ... that these markets will deliver significant returns for the patient investor.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t expect Martin Gilbert, chief executive of fund manager Aberdeen Asset Management, to say anything else about emerging markets. But use of the word \u201cpatient\u201d is a giveaway: 2016 is not looking promising. After net outflows of \u00a333.9bn in 2015, it\u2019s not what shareholders wanted to hear. But that\u2019s life \u2013 sovereign wealth funds, under budget squeezes from the low oil price, are liquidating assets and emerging markets are deeply out of fashion. For Aberdeen, it\u2019s a case of waiting for the pain to pass. Certainly, it\u2019s no time to be looking for salvation in the form of a bidder. Gilbert, thankfully, gave a strong defence of the virtues of independence. Let\u2019s hope he means it. The fund management industry is already populated by quite enough big banks.",

It\u2019s not clear what this mission is meant to involve, other than shedding staff and overheads at a faster pace than Jenkins could manage, but here\u2019s one area where Barclays would benefit from less dynamism, not more: relations with regulators.</p> <p>You need to know that your new employer has a tendency to surround the referee to argue the toss when it doesn\u2019t like a decision. It\u2019s not a good way to behave and, more to the point, the tactic usually doesn\u2019t work.</p> <p>Jenkins got off on the wrong foot. Back in 2013 he said Barclays might be forced to cut lending to the UK economy if the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) insisted on seeing a rapid improvement in the bank\u2019s leverage ratios. The suggestion-cum-threat caused uproar and, if it was intended to reassure shareholders, it backfired. Within months, Barclays launched a \u00a35.8bn rights issue.</p> <p>Unfortunately, your new chairman, John McFarlane, has also acquired a reputation for quarrelling over rules he doesn\u2019t like, such as ringfencing, the requirement for banks to erect an internal division between their investment banking and retail divisions by 2019. \u201cThere is a serious question as to whether all these statutory and regulatory changes are really necessary,\u201d he told the Sunday Times in May.</p> <p>Such complaints may have succeeded in watering down a few minor new rules but the ring-fence itself will be a fact of life. It has been approved by parliament and the PRA is clear it will stamp on any restructuring proposal from a bank that seeks to dodge the spirit of the rules. Indeed, the complaints have only succeeded in opening a separate debate about banks\u2019 lobbying tactics \u2013 Barclays, note, got a dishonourable mention at the Treasury select committee a fortnight ago.</p> <p>Circumspection is required, Mr Staley, especially from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/26/barclays-fined-72m-elephant-deal-fca\">a bank that was whacked with yet another big fine last week</a>.

      "bodyText": "British shoppers spent hundreds of millions of pounds on Cyber Monday, after setting a new internet retail record on Black Friday, underlining the online shopping revolution. Initial estimates show that online spending on Black Friday grew by more than a third, with retailers including Amazon and John Lewis reporting their biggest ever day of trading. Online sales on Black Friday hit \u00a31.1bn, up 36% on last year, according to data company Experian and trade group IMRG, making it the biggest day of online shopping ever and the first time the \u00a31bn mark has been breached. Amazon, the world\u2019s biggest online retailer, said it sold more than 7.4m items on Black Friday in the UK, up from 5.5m last year. Another \u00a3943m is expected to be spent on Monday, up 31%, on a day that has been nicknamed Cyber Monday. The first Monday of December used to be the biggest online shopping day of the year as families bought Christmas presents. It was overtaken for the first time last year by Black Friday as shoppers snapped up bargains and then waited until nearer Christmas to make further purchases. Almost \u00a33.5bn is thought to have been spent in total online by shoppers over the four days from Black Friday to Cyber Monday. Much of this spending could have been funded through debt, with lending to consumers reaching its highest level since before the banking crisis, according to figures from the Bank of England. There are fears that Black Friday was a damp squib for retailers on the high street, with only a limited number of people queueing for bargains compared with the chaotic scenes of last year. The sales figures suggest consumers focused on grabbing bargains online instead, and that retailers have spread their promotions across the weekend, or even a week. John Lewis said Black Friday was its biggest ever day of trading, although the year-on-year sales growth of 11.9% was significantly down on the wider growth recorded by Experianand IMRG. John Lewis said there had been a \u201cdifferent pattern of trade to last year\u201d, with sales on Black Friday driven by online spending but its stores enjoying a 9.3% sales increase on the Saturday. Popular items included wearable technology, which rose 932% on Black Friday, Dyson products, which rose 208%, and Lego, which was up 90%. The peak for sales was between 9am and 10am on Black Friday, when John Lewis received 4.9 orders per second. Mark Lewis, John Lewis\u2019s retail director, said: \u201cOn Friday online trade really stepped forward, while shops saw their biggest increases over the weekend, showing that more than ever customers like to mix and match channels to shop in the most convenient way for them.\u201d The winners and losers of Black Friday will not emerge until January, when retailers publish their trading updates for the Christmas period. Analysts at Barclays said Dixons Carphone, Argos, Asos and Zara led the way in terms of the discounts they offered. Christodoulos Chaviaras, analyst at the bank, said he expected footfall on the high street was down \u201cmaterially\u201d and also accused retailers of exaggerating their discounts. \u201cThree new attributes of this year\u2019s Black Friday were: retailers paced themselves more with their promotional stance; their infrastructure, especially IT, was better prepared than last year; and customers increasingly preferred online shopping from the comfort of home this year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would expect footfall in stores to be down materially, as much as 5%, but online sales growth should more than offset the drop in store traffic. Prices did come down week on week, but in many cases we noticed that the deals advertised compared the new price to a very old price, hence exaggerating the discount [percentage] advertised. This could be an indication of retailers being more margin conscious this year. \u201cWebsite crashes were far less [frequent] this year, which we believe is owed to retailers increasing the capacity of their IT platforms.\u201d Andy Mulcahy, of IMRG, added: \u201cBlack Friday appeared to be in a state of transition this year, as many retailers extended their campaigns to run over a week or even longer to ease the pressure on their operations. \u201cNevertheless, it seems there is still a perception that the day itself is the time to get the best deals as it drew record volumes to retail sites \u2013 most likely boosted by shoppers who stayed away from the high street in order to avoid a repeat of the scenes from last year. \u201cHaving so many different ways to browse and shop on retail sites will have played a part as well, with \u00a3495m being spent on smartphones and tablets on Black Friday.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Four Seasons warns of existential crisis at UK care homes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of Britain\u2019s biggest care home operator has warned that the industry faces an existential crisis after George Osborne failed to address a funding black hole in the autumn statement. Care homes across the UK are being squeezed by a fall in the fees that councils pay towards residents and a rise in costs, which will be exacerbated by the introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d in April. Ian Smith, chairman of Four Seasons Health Care, said the company was closing homes and not investing in upgrading existing sites because of the financial pressures on the business. However, Smith denied the quality of care was declining in Four Seasons homes, despite 12 of its sites being under embargo \u2013 which means they cannot take new residents \u2013 more than double the number two years ago. Four Seasons faces additional problems \u2013 more than one in seven of its beds are empty and it is sitting on \u00a3500m of debt, which is costing it \u00a350m a year in interest. In the autumn statement, the chancellor announced a string of measures designed to support social care. They included allowing councils to increase council tax by up to 2% to fund adult social care \u2013 which could raise up to \u00a32bn a year by 2020 \u2013 and handing an extra \u00a31.5bn to the Better Care Fund, an organisation designed to encourage local authorities and the NHS to cooperate. However, Smith said this was not enough: \u201cBritain should be looking after its elderly people better.\u201d The Four Seasons chairman criticised the Better Care Fund but also claimed local councils would not be able to raise enough money from council tax to fund social care, and that the government should be helping to finance the introduction of the national living wage. He said: \u201cThe Better Care Fund is what irritates me. Not one pound is getting through to elderly and frail people in our homes \u2026 It needs to get through to people who need it.\u201d On the council tax precept, he added: \u201cIn northern constituencies they just won\u2019t be able to raise the money, these are impoverished places like Knowsley or Birkenhead, where I am from. They don\u2019t have as much money as Basingstoke. We are letting them down so badly. We are really trying to engage with government to get this right. They are failing our elderly people, and it is putting huge pressure on the NHS.\u201d Smith said care homes needed an increase of 6-10% in funding from councils \u201cjust to stand still\u201d.

      "bodyText": "More than 2,000 workers at the digger maker JCB have voted to work fewer hours to reduce the number of redundancies demanded by the company as it struggles to cope with falling global demand for mining and construction equipment. The GMB union said more than 100 jobs were saved after workers at JCB\u2019s four major factories agreed to reduce their weekly hours from 39 to 34 with immediate effect. The deal, which will last three months, will cut JCB\u2019s wage bill after a collapse in global sales triggered by the slowing Chinese economy. Demand for JCB equipment has fallen fastest in China, Brazil and Russia. Sales in Russia tumbled by 70% in the first six months of the year, while Brazil fell by 36% and China by 47%. Parts of Europe were also struggling, with France down by 26%, it said. Even the strong growth in the UK and North America has softened due to a fall in market confidence that has pushed oil prices and commodity prices to post-crash lows. In September, JCB said the loss of business meant it needed to shed 400 shop-floor posts. Discussions with the union whittled this number down to 290. GMB said the company had agreed to scrap proposals for compulsory redundancies, and the number of posts likely to go was 135 or fewer through early retirements and voluntary redundancies. A flexible working pattern will operate for the next three months at JCB world headquarters in Rocester, Staffordshire, the heavy products factory in Uttoxeter, the cab systems in Rugeley and and JCB transmissions in Wrexham. \u201cThe number of hours worked at each site will now vary depending on production volumes but will be 34 hours or above,\u201d the union said. \u201cEmployees will have the choice of either being paid for just the reduced hours worked or being paid for the full 39 hour week and then working back the \u2018banked\u2019 hours next year.\u201d Caterpillar, JCB\u2019s US rival, warned in September that falling sales meant its global workforce would need to shrink by between 4,000 and 5,000 by the end of 2016 and job cuts could reach 10,000 by the end of 2018. Gordon Richardson, GMB works convenor at JCB, said: \u201cGMB members are to be congratulated on the result of the ballot. It\u2019s a magnanimous act which is in the spirit of the approaching festive season and means that over 100 people who were under threat of compulsory redundancy will now have a much happier Christmas.\u201d JCB\u2019s chief executive, Graeme Macdonald, said: \u201cOur shop-floor colleagues are to be applauded for their actions. JCB and the GMB were determined to do everything possible to avoid compulsory redundancies through a combination of voluntary redundancies, early retirements and flexible working.\u201d JCB is majority owned by the Tory peer Lord Bamford who has campaigned against the UK remaining in the EU.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally, Katie Allen sums up tonight\u2019s big news from the IMF: China\u2019s yuan will be added to an elite basket of global currencies used by the International Monetary Fund, in a boost to Beijing\u2019s global economic ambitions. Shareholders in the Washington-based IMF voted to include the yuan, also known as the renminbi, as the fifth member of its special drawing rights (SDR) currency basket alongside the dollar, the Japanese yen, sterling and the euro. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, said on Monday that including the yuan in the basket was an important milestone in integrating China into the global financial system. She said: \u201cIt is also a recognition of the progress that the Chinese authorities have made in the past years in reforming China\u2019s monetary and financial systems. The continuation and deepening of these efforts will bring about a more robust international monetary and financial system, which in turn will support the growth and stability of China and the global economy,\u201d China had been lobbying for the IMF to add the yuan to its basket of currencies, which it uses to lend to sovereign borrowers. A vote by representatives of the IMF\u2019s member countries to support the move marks a significant milestone for Beijing as it seeks to put the yuan on a par with the US dollar and play a growing role in global markets. Analysts had widely expected the vote in favour of the yuan being added, after IMF staff recommended the move earlier this month. Lagarde endorsed that view, saying the yuan appeared to meet important criteria, including being deemed \u201ca freely usable currency\u201d. For more, read on here: And that\u2019s all for tonight. Our earlier summary covered the main developments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow! GW The US dollar, pound and yen have all lost a little space in the SRD currency basket, to make room for the renmimbi. The biggest lose, though, is the euro - its share falls from 37.4% to below 31%. So, does the IMF\u2019s decision mean the yuan is about to overthrow the US dollar and become the world\u2019s pre-eminent reserve currency? No. Eswar Prasad, a former senior official for the IMF in China, explains that this won\u2019t happen... ...unless economic reforms are accompanied by broader legal, political, and institutional reforms that are necessary to inspire the trust of foreign investors. China\u2019s government has made it abundantly clear that such reforms are not on the cards. So American\u2019s shouldn\u2019t worry too much. That\u2019s via FastFT: This move is a vote of confidence in China\u2019s currency, says Jeremy Cook of foreign exchange firm World First. It might encourage Beijing to continue to open up the renmimbi, making it easier for small firms in Britain (and beyond) to use it. Cook explains: \u201cThe impact outside of the investment world is limited in the short term however the hope must be that the move prompts additional longer-term reforms in the flexibility of the currency and the ease with which UK SMEs can use the yuan for international trade and payments.\u201d Here\u2019s the moment that Christine Lagarde announced that the yuan has the IMF\u2019s seal of approval, and will join its currency basket. Here\u2019s the official statement from IMF chief Christine Lagarde, confirming that China\u2019s yuan (or renmimbi) has been ranked alongside the dollar, pound, euro and yen: \u201cThe Executive Board\u2019s decision to include the RMB in the SDR [Special Drawing Reserve] basket is an important milestone in the integration of the Chinese economy into the global financial system. It is also a recognition of the progress that the Chinese authorities have made in the past years in reforming China\u2019s monetary and financial systems. The continuation and deepening of these efforts will bring about a more robust international monetary and financial system, which in turn will support the growth and stability of China and the global economy.\u201d The value of the SDR will be based on a weighted average of the values of the basket of currencies comprising the U.S. dollar, euro, the Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, and British pound.... EG: Lagarde continues... The inclusion of the RMB will enhance the attractiveness of the SDR by diversifying the basket and making it more representative of the world\u2019s major currencies. The SDR interest rate will continue to be determined as a weighted average of the interest rates on short-term financial instruments in the markets of the currencies in the SDR basket. Authorities of all currencies represented in the SDR basket, which now includes the Chinese authorities, are expected to maintain a policy framework that facilitates operations for the IMF, its membership and other SDR users in their currencies. The paper presented to the Board will be released soon. Via the IMF website. It appears that the yuan will make up almost 11% of the IMF\u2019s currency basket, once it has been admitted to the Special Drawing Rights fold. It\u2019s official -- the International Monetary Fund has given its approval to adding China\u2019s yuan to the currencies which make up its Special Drawing Reserves. It\u2019s a symbolic moment in China\u2019s economic development - putting the yuan alongside the euro, US dollar, yen and sterling. Christine Lagarde has called it an \u201cimportant milestone\u201d, which will also better reflect the state of the global economy: As we explain here, SDRs are the reserve asset which underpin the IMF\u2019s role in supporting the financial system: This year\u2019s Black Friday didn\u2019t see a repeat of the pushing, shoving and falling over that generated headlines and bruises in 2014. But it does appear that UK consumers spent more this time around: That\u2019s a win-win for retailers - more sales, without photos of customers fighting over a cheap telly. China\u2019s slowdown hasn\u2019t just hit commodities. CNBC asked a group of chief financial officers from Europe and Asia if trading with China had changed this year - and half reported a deterioration in business: The Bank of England insists that it could raise interest rates in 2016 - but scepticism is rife. An experienced City economist had just predicted that rates could remain at just 0.5% for another 18 months: This should be a Big Week for economics and finance, with the ECB\u2019s monetary policy meeting on Thursday and a crucial US jobs report on Friday which could cement - or derail - an interest rate hike. Plus an OPEC meeting on Friday - where oil companies will deliberate over the state of the market. But today has been quite subdued, so here\u2019s a quick recap: Iron ore prices have hit their lowest levels on record. Weak demand, and a strong dollar, pushed down commodity prices - analysts say the oversupply in the steel industry could keep iron ore under the thumb. Mining shares have taken a predictable hit. BHP Billiton was the biggest faller; it also faces a major lawsuit over the fatal accident at a Brazilian mine. European markets have risen. There\u2019s growing confidence that the ECB will deliver a new dose of stimulus on Thursday. The UK\u2019s Funding For Lending Scheme has been extended by two years. The move is meant protect small firms from a damaging drop-off in credit. Shoppers have been firing up their browsers for Cyber Monday. Analysts predict that spending will be up this year: Greece\u2019s finance minister has said he hopes to agree a debt restructuring deal in February 2016. Failure to do so will hit confidence and postpone the recovery, Euclid Tsakalotos warned. And the IMF is deliberating whether to add China\u2019s yuan to its Special Drawing Rights basket. As Bloomberg explains, it\u2019s an eagerly awaited decision..... International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde and some two dozen officials on the fund\u2019s executive board will gather Monday at headquarters in Washington for one of the most-anticipated decisions outside of actually approving loans for nations in crisis. The question inside the 12th-floor, oval boardroom: whether to grant China\u2019s yuan status as a reserve currency by adding it to the fund\u2019s Special Drawing Rights basket. The SDR, created in 1969, gives IMF member countries who hold it the right to obtain any of the currencies in the basket -- currently the dollar, euro, yen and pound -- to meet balance-of-payments needs. Over in Athens, finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has told investors that Greece hopes to achieve a deal on debt relief in February 2016: Speaking at the American-Hellenic Chamber of Commerce today, Tsakalotos said agreement on debt sustainability was vital to rebuilding confidence and returning Greece to economic growth. He warned: \u201cIf we don\u2019t make the critical decision in let\u2019s say February 2016, and we push the critical decision back to next summer or even 2017, then all the results will be delayed.\u201d Greece\u2019s creditors agreed to consider debt relief measures as part of the third bailout which was drawn up this summer. As we covered this morning, the European Stability Mechanism\u2019s boss hopes a deal can be reached - but rules out a haircut on Greek debt. So it may not be an easy discussion After a weak start, the main European stock markets have now turned positive. Investors are pretty optimistic that the European Central Bank will announce new stimulus measures at its meeting on Thursday: Here\u2019s the situation: ECB president Mario Draghi has already signalled that the governing council will act, to spur inflation and demand higher. But what might he do? One option is to extend the current quantitative easing programme beyond September 2016, to buy up even more government and corporate debt. Another is to cut the \u2018deposit rate\u2019 charged on bank deposits at the ECB, deeper into negative territory. And anticipation of such moves has already driven bond prices higher, and weakened the euro. So there\u2019s a danger that the ECB might \u2018under-deliver\u2019. Economist Fred Ducrozet reckons Draghi should resist firing all its ammo this week: While Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi is expecting something significant: Our own Katie Allen has explained why the IMF might add China\u2019s yuan to its basket of currencies, and why it matters: Chancellor George Osborne says small firms will benefit from the extension to the UK\u2019s\u2019 Funding for Lending Scheme: It was due to expire in January but I am pleased to say that we are extending the scheme until 2018, supporting more loans. Given the improvement we\u2019ve seen in credit conditions for households and large businesses, as our long-term economic plan moves from rescue to rebuild it is right that we continue to focus the scheme\u2019s firepower on the small businesses that are the lifeblood of the economy. The Funding for Lending Scheme will be gradually wound down as the recovery strengthens, delivering a managed exit from the scheme.\u201d  FLS could also be a handy weapon if the recovery weakens, of course.... Just in... the Bank of England and the Treasury have announced that they are extending their \u201cFunding for Lending Scheme\u201d for another two years. FLS was created after the financial crisis, to encourage the flow of credit to UK companies. It is now mainly focused on smaller firms, who still complain that it\u2019s hard to borrow affordably. The BoE says that some progress has been made: A variety of sources indicate that credit conditions for SMEs have been improving: SME lending volumes have increased by \u00a32.1 billion in 2015 so far, and net lending to SMEs by FLS participants was positive in the first two quarters of 2015. However, credit conditions for SMEs remain tighter than for large corporations. So today\u2019s move means FLS will be wound down slowly until January 2018, rather than clanging shut and causing a sudden contraction in credit availability. Or as the Bank puts it: The extension will also ensure that the scheme is gradually phased out, with borrowing allowances reducing over time, thereby minimising risks to the economic recovery from the withdrawal of funding support. The move shows that the Bank doesn\u2019t believe financial conditions have yet returned to normality (which is why it has resisted raising borrowing costs) - as trader Nic Dukes tweets: These pictures from Australia\u2019s Pilbara region remind us what a huge, and messy, operation iron ore production is: The \u2018spot price\u2019 of iron ore has just hit its lowest price on record, according to industry group Metal Bulletin. A tonne of iron ore will cost you less than $43 today, as the selloff which began in Asia ripples through Europe. As explained in our earlier post, iron ore prices are falling due to weakening demand for steel - due to oversupply problems and China\u2019s slowdown - and the US dollar rally (as the Federal Reserve will probably raise interest rates this month). Never let it be said that bankers are a cold-hearted lot... The prospect of paying billions to the Brazilian government in compensation for the Samarco dam disaster has pushed BHP Billiton\u2019s shares down to their lowest since 2008. It\u2019s been a rubbish year for mining shares. The emerging market slowdown has brought the commodity super cycle to a shuddering halt, sending metal prices to multi-years lows. BHP Billiton, for example, has lost 41% of its market capitalisation this year. Anglo American has shed over 66%. So is it time to ask Santa for some mining shares? Chris Beauchamp of IG suggests not: The sector continues to be an illustration of the idea that cheap stocks tend to get cheaper, with little sign that we are nearing a bottom in this beleaguered sector. Before you get carried away with the excitement (?!) of Cyber Monday - beware, your purchases may not arrive as soon as promised. UK shoppers are expected to splash out around \u00a31bn on online bargains today, having been on a spending spree since Black Friday. That\u2019s the equivalent of over 20 million parcels in a day - and Stuart Higgins, of logistics firm LCP Consulting, reckons some won\u2019t cope. He told BBC Breakfast that: \u201cA staggering 10% of that won\u2019t be delivered on time and that\u2019s because retailers haven\u2019t got their back end fulfilment capabilities - their organisation, processes and infrastructure - in place to cope with the marketing hype that has been created around Black Friday.\u201d Denmark has suffered an unexpected contraction, hit by a slump in demand for its exports. Danish GDP shrank by 0.1% in the last quarter, data released this morning shows, compared to a 0.2% expansion in Q2. This was mainly due to a 1.7% decline in exports, while household consumption was flat. There\u2019s better news from Sweden, though - it posted a 0.8% rise in GDP in July-September. The iron ore rout is pulling down mining shares in London. BHP Billiton, which produces copper, iron, gold, and coal, is leading the FTSE 100 fallers, down almost 6%. Traders are also reacting to the Brazilian government\u2019s decision to sue BHP, and Brazilian mining giant Vale, over the collapse of a dam which killed at least 13 people and caused serious environmental damage. Brazil is seeking more than $5bn from the two companies, to cover the cost of compensation and cleaning up after the disaster. Environment minister Izabella Teixeira told a press conference: \u201cThere was a huge impact from an environmental point of view.... \u201cIt is not a natural disaster. It is a disaster prompted by economic activity, but of a magnitude equivalent to those disasters created by forces of nature. The head of one of Greece\u2019s four creditors has declared that he\u2019s optimistic that Athens will get its much-anticipated debt restructuring. Klaus Regling, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism (which handles bailout loans) told a Finnish newspaper that Greece should get assistance with debt repayments. However, he doesn\u2019t think that will include an actual \u2018haircut\u2019 on debts - more likely it will be more time to repay loans, or a lower interest rates. The ESM has helpfully tweeted the key points, for those of us who didn\u2019t pay attention during Finnish lessons: European stock markets have started the week on the back foot, as the selloff in commodity prices feeds through to equities. Here\u2019s the damage: In London, the FTSE 100 fell by around 0.75% in early trading, dragged down by mining stocks. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: The FTSE fell afoul of its usual bugbear this morning, its calamitous commodity sector. Not that the oil and mining stocks are as bad as normal, but rather that with little else on offer, and iron ore falling to a 5 month low, the UK index couldn\u2019t manage to mitigate its 45 point drop as the day got underway. The German DAX was hit by the news that retail sales fell by 0.4% in October. November has been the cruellest month in a while for gold bugs. It has dropped by 7.5% this month, putting it on track for its worst month in two and a half years. The gold price fell below $1,053/ounce this morning, near to a six-year low. It\u2019s another casualty of the US interest rate hike speculation, as traders ditch bullion in favour of the US dollar and assets that actually pay a return (even if they don\u2019t look as pretty). Analysts at Maike Futures, a brokerage firm, say that iron prices are being pulled down by oversupply: \u201cSupply continues to rise while port inventories are starting to climb, weighing on iron ore prices.\u201d The iron ore price is weakening today, hit by fears over the global economy and the strengthening US dollar. The commodities rout has sent iron ore prices down to a five-month low in China overnight. It was triggered by concerns that Chinese steelmakers are slashing their take-up of iron, in the face of weakening demand at home and abroad. Reuters has the details: The most active iron ore futures May contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange dropped to a session low of 293 yuan ($45.81) a tonne, its weakest since July 9. Prices were 3.5 percent lower at 294 yuan by 0250 GMT. Iron ore prices have tumbled 35 percent since the beginning of the year as China\u2019s economy cools and construction activity slows in the country. And Bloomberg flags up that prices in Singapore have fallen below the $40 per tonne mark: The commodity sector are also suffering from predictions that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this month. That\u2019s because: 1) Investors are moving capital out of emerging markets and back into the US dollar, in anticipation of receiving a higher rate of return 2) A stronger US dollar pushes down the cost of metals priced in dollars. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It could be a red letter day for China. The International Monetary Fund is due to decide whether to add the yuan to its prestigious basket of currencies. This would be a big endorsement for the Chinese currency - placing the renmimbi alongside sterling, the US dollar, the yen and the euro. As Katie Allen explains: China has been lobbying for the IMF to add the yuan to its basket of reserve currencies, which it uses to lend to sovereign borrowers. A vote to include the currency in the SDR basket would mark a significant milestone for Beijing, according to experts. \u201cThe direct impact won\u2019t be felt in the near term, not least because implementation of the new basket won\u2019t be until Q3 2016. However the symbolic importance cannot be overlooked,\u201d said Andrew Malcolm, Asia head of capital markets at law firm Linklaters. There\u2019s no excuse for not cracking on with Christmas planning (I\u2019m reliably informed....). And today is Cyber Monday, when shops begin offering tempting offers to online customers. Retailers are hoping customers who resisted the lure of Black Friday might start spending today. And Tom Hayes, the FX trader jailed over the Libor scandal, is due in court to appeal his 14 year-prison term. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

      "bodyText": "What is happening to the yuan? Shareholders in the Washington-based International Monetary Fund have voted to admit the yuan, also known as the renminbi, as the fifth member of its special drawing rights (SDR) currency basket alongside the US dollar, the Japanese yen, sterling and the euro. What does this mean for China\u2019s authorities? Beijing has long hoped the yuan would be added to the small list of currencies that help set the value of SDRs, an international reserve asset that was created by the IMF to supplement its member countries\u2019 official reserves. Experts say a vote to include the yuan in the SDR is a big political victory for China. China hopes this stamp of approval will increase the yuan\u2019s desirability as a reserve currency for investors and undermine the hegemony of the dollar as a global reserve currency. Currency strategists at RBC Capital Markets think that the inclusion of the yuan will mean more politically than financially. \u201cMore than anything, it is a symbolic and political milestone in China\u2019s long path to renminbi internationalisation,\u201d they wrote in a research note before the widely expected decision to add the yuan to the basket. Getting the yuan in the SDR basket is a big achievement for the Chinese government, agrees Prof Kamel Mellahi at Warwick business school. He sees the move as a vote of confidence in the economic and financial reforms under way in China. But authorities, including the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) central bank, still have more work to do. \u201cThe inclusion of the yuan in the basket of international currencies is a huge symbolic victory for China, but comes with strings attached to it,\u201d says Mellahi, who researches business in China and other emerging economies. \u201cChina has been loosening its tight grip on the management of the yuan for a while, but now the PBOC is going to come under immense pressure to be more transparent and improve its way of communicating with international markets. This requires massive cultural and procedural changes. Also, China will have to loosen its grip on the management of its currency and introduce a bunch of financial reforms.\u201d What is the special drawing rights system? The special drawing rights (SDR) system was created by the IMF in 1969 to support the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system. As the IMF explains: \u201cA country participating in this system [Bretton Woods] needed official reserves \u2013 government or central bank holdings of gold and widely accepted foreign currencies \u2013 that could be used to purchase the domestic currency in foreign exchange markets, as required to maintain its exchange rate. \u201cBut the international supply of two key reserve assets \u2013 gold and the US dollar \u2013 proved inadequate for supporting the expansion of world trade and financial development that was taking place. Therefore, the international community decided to create a new international reserve asset under the auspices of the IMF.\u201d Not long after the creation of the SDR, the Bretton Woods system collapsed and the major currencies shifted to a floating exchange rate regime. But the SDR system has become more important again recently by supplementing member countries\u2019 official reserves during the credit crunch and global financial crisis. So is the SDR a currency? No. The SDR is instead an international reserve asset which the IMF uses to supplement its member countries\u2019 reserves. The SDR\u2019s value is based on the basket of the four international currencies and SDRs can be exchanged for \u201cfreely usable\u201d currencies, the IMF says. SDRs are allocated to IMF members from time to time. From October next year, once the yuan is added, the basket will have five currencies. Nor is the SDR a claim on the IMF, rather it is a \u201cpotential claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF members\u201d, the IMF says. Holders of SDRs can obtain those currencies in exchange for their SDRs. They can either arrange exchanges between members or the IMF can designate members with strong external positions \u2013 those with big current account surpluses \u2013 to purchase SDRs from members with weak external positions. How do currencies get added to the SDR basket? The SDR basket, upon which the SDR\u2019s value is based, is typically reviewed every five years by the IMF\u2019s executive board to ensure that it \u201creflects the relative importance of currencies in the global trading and financial systems\u201d. The weighting of different currencies can shift at these reviews and it is also an opportunity to add new currencies. The last time that happened was in 1999 when the newly created euro single currency was added, although technically it replaced the outgoing German deutschmark and French franc. The IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, released a statement this month saying its staff were now recommending including the yuan in the SDR basket. On 30 November, the IMF\u2019s executive board, whose members represent all 188 countries in the IMF, voted to add the yuan. What criteria must currencies meet to join the basket? The basket is based on currencies from the four countries or currency unions \u2013 such as the eurozone \u2013 whose exports of goods and services had the largest value over a five-year period. Once China\u2019s yuan is added, that list of currency issuers expands from four to five. To join the basket, a currency must also be judged by the IMF\u2019s executive board to be \u201ca freely usable currency\u201d. In other words, it must be a currency that is widely used to make payments for international transactions and widely traded in the main exchange markets. There is also an \u201cexport criterion\u201d, designed to ensure that currencies in the basket are those issued by IMF members or currency unions that \u201cplay a central role in the global economy\u201d, in the IMF\u2019s words. Does China\u2019s yuan meet the criteria? The IMF\u2019s experts think so and the IMF emphasises that \u201cfreely usable\u201d relates to the actual international use and trading of currencies, and is different from whether a currency is freely floating. Chinese authorities have announced a series of changes to liberalise the country\u2019s financial markets, moves seen as also helping the yuan meet the freely usable rule. In particular, Beijing\u2019s surprise devaluation of the yuan this year was seen as a move towards allowing the market, instead of the government, to fix the the currency\u2019s value, thereby easing the way to SDR inclusion. But not everyone is convinced the criteria have really been met, says Jasper Lawler, a market analyst at the spread betting company CMC Markets UK. \u201cGiven the heavy-handed government intervention in Chinese markets of late, from the currency devaluation to disallowing institutions from selling shares, there are fears the IMF may be bending the rules to accommodate the world\u2019s second largest economy into its special drawing rights.\u201d",

In other words, it must be a currency that is widely used to make payments for international transactions and widely traded in the main exchange markets.</p> <p>There is also an \u201cexport criterion\u201d, designed to ensure that currencies in the basket are those issued by IMF members or currency unions that \u201cplay a central role in the global economy\u201d, in the IMF\u2019s words. </p> <h2>Does China\u2019s yuan meet the criteria?</h2> <p>The IMF\u2019s experts think so and the IMF emphasises that \u201cfreely usable\u201d relates to the actual international use and trading of currencies, and is different from whether a currency is freely floating.</p> <p>Chinese authorities have announced a series of changes to liberalise the country\u2019s financial markets, moves seen as also helping the yuan meet the freely usable rule. In particular, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/14/china-halts-yuan-devaluation-with-slight-official-rise-against-us-dollar\">Beijing\u2019s surprise devaluation of the yuan this year</a> was seen as a move towards allowing the market, instead of the government, to fix the the currency\u2019s value, thereby easing the way to SDR inclusion.</p> <p>But not everyone is convinced the criteria have really been met, says Jasper Lawler, a market analyst at the spread betting company CMC Markets UK. \u201cGiven the heavy-handed government intervention in Chinese markets of late, from the currency devaluation to disallowing institutions from selling shares, there are fears the IMF may be bending the rules to accommodate the world\u2019s second largest economy into its special drawing rights.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was a phonebook that led Flora to Laura Merriott, who she says helped save the lives of her twins. About a year ago, Flora, 39, found out she was pregnant. The pregnancy was unplanned; her boyfriend had left. And so Flora, who until that moment had been anti-abortion, picked up a phonebook and started looking for a place that could help her. \u201cThe father had left and I had no help. I was trying to find out how I could get an abortion or somebody that could help me pay for an abortion,\u201d she said. That\u2019s when she found it: Women\u2019s Care Center of Erie County Inc. \u201cI called them thinking that they were a place that helps with abortions. They had me come in for a meeting to talk to them about it. I explained my situation and then I came to find out I wasn\u2019t there for them to help me get an abortion. I was there for them to help save my baby.\u201d That first meeting was not enough to convince Flora to keep her pregnancy.She did, however, agree to try counseling. That\u2019s when she was introduced to Laura Merriott, president of Save Unborn Life. Is $3,000 enough to stop an abortion? Merriott, a retired US air force nurse who had always been pro-life, used to volunteer at the center. After seeing a number of women decide to go through with abortion due to financial reasons, she thought to herself: why don\u2019t we just give them money? And so Save Unborn Life was born. As of this November, by her count, Merriott has given money to 70 mothers, including Flora. \u201cWe have had 73 babies because we have had three sets of twins that were saved,\u201d she said. How much money is enough to convince an expecting mother not to have abortion? According to Merriott, it\u2019s $3,000. The contract that Merriott has with the expecting mothers stipulates that after the expecting mother carries the baby to term, she will receive the funds. The contract is available in its entirety on Save Unborn Life\u2019s website. But is it enough? Before the question is even finished, Merriott answered: \u201cIt has been. For just this purpose \u2013 for them to get through that difficult decision whether to end the baby\u2019s life or not. For some people, it\u2019s not enough and they say no. They are not going to accept the contract. That\u2019s not going to do it for them and unfortunately they go on and have an abortion.\u201d Most of the women who visit the center are on Medicaid. The center also provides a number of services that help to minimize the costs of the pregnancy. Merriott sometimes helps mothers with groceries and diapers; she and the center refer them to soup kitchens, and the center also helps women obtain items such as donated cribs and baby clothes. Brenda Newport, who runs the pro-life center in Erie where Flora went looking for an abortion, said the offer of $3,000 is helpful if the money is \u201cthe overall motivating factor\u201d. \u201c[I]f it\u2019s just some material help and if it\u2019s just \u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do for an apartment, I\u2019m going to need a deposit for my first month\u2019s rent,\u2019 well, a few thousand dollars will really help,\u201d Newport told the National Review last year. When the Guttmacher Institute, which focuses on sexual and reproductive health research, interviewed more than 1,000 women in 2004 about why they decided to have an abortion, 73% of them said they could not afford a child. A third of the women, who were asked to provide reasons for the decision, said they were students or planning on studies; about 23% couldn\u2019t afford basic needs; 28% said that they couldn\u2019t afford a baby and childcare; a little over one in five (22%) were unemployed; and 21% could not afford to leave their jobs to take care of a baby. There is no question that $3,000 is a short-term solution. To raise a child born in 2013 will cost $245,340 over the first 18 years of his or her life, according to the US Department of Agriculture. This includes food, housing, childcare and education. When reached for comment, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood said: \u201cPlanned Parenthood believes strongly that a woman should have access to accurate information about all her options \u2013 including safe and legal abortion \u2013 presented without stigma or judgment. That information should support her, help her make a decision for herself, and enable her to take care of her health and wellbeing. It should not be provided with the intent of coercing, shaming or judging her.\u201d \u2018I am going to do the best I can to raise them\u2019 Was it the money that convinced Flora a year ago? \u201cIt\u2019s just the things they said, along with the money \u2013 it helped,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help nearly enough. It\u2019s really expensive to raise babies. But as far as them talking to me and counseling and helping me with things I was going through and just being there for me along the way and pushing my spirits up \u2013 all that helps.\u201d The money she received from Merriott helped take the pressure off during these early months. Her twins, one boy and one girl, are now three months old. Before the twins were born, Flora was already a mom of four. Her oldest two sons have moved out; sometimes their girlfriends stop by to give Flora a hand with the twins. Her mother also helps. They are tight-knit family, yet things are still hard. Before she got pregnant, Flora was on disability benefits, taking care of her two youngest children, five and nine years old. She hoped to move out of Erie. Now with the twins at home, that probably will not happen. \u201cMost of the time I am here, alone, and it\u2019s a struggle,\u201d she said. \u201cThey both cry at the same time. They wake up at the same time. They want to be fed and changed at the same time. It\u2019s very difficult. They have their days and nights mixed up so they are up all night.\u201d But more than three months after giving birth, Flora said she does not regret signing Merriott\u2019s contract. Growing up, she said, she used to tell people that she could \u201cnever kill a baby\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t care how it happened, no matter if I was raped or whatever, it doesn\u2019t matter, because it\u2019s mine and I would never do that. Until I got put in my own situation and then, you know, I sat and thought: \u2018Wow. Now, I see now why people did the things that they did and why they did get rid of their babies in the situation they were in.\u2019 Because I ended up being one of those people, and I have thought about it and wanted to and was so close to going through with it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut thank God I didn\u2019t because I don\u2019t know what I would do without them. I love them to death. They are so beautiful. They are darling ... And even though the father left us \u2013 he just left us high and dry with no call and no nothing \u2013 I am going to do the best I can to raise them.\u201d \u2018More can be saved\u2019 About a decade before Save Unborn Life took off, Merriott was working at Family Health Services of Erie and Crawford County. She was hired in 1994 as a part-time nurse. She was let go years later, in 1998, after she refused to hand out birth control pills or condoms to single men and women. Merriott attempted to sue the clinic to get her job back. In her deposition, she said she had re-examined her Roman Catholic faith and could no longer hand out forms of birth control. Her faith has also played a role in setting up Save Unborn Life. \u201cI feel as many as I can save before I meet my maker, that\u2019s what I want to do,\u201d she told the Guardian. Her inspiration for the organization? Schindler\u2019s List. The movie focuses on Oskar Schindler, who employed Polish Jews at his factories in order to save them from being sent to concentration camps and used his fortune to bribe Nazi officials to save their lives. \u201cI\u2019ve watched it many times, and for him to have offered money for the workers \u2013 for the Jews that were going to be killed in the concentration camp \u2013 money is what it took. And he saved 1,100 of them,\u201d says Merriott. If pro-life Americans really wanted to save unborn children, they could easily do so, she added: \u201cAnd with small amounts of money \u2013 in my mind, $3,000 is a small amount of money. If we got many, many big donors we might be able to offer them more, too, and then more can be saved.\u201d Until now, most of the money has come from her family, some organizations and a number of small donors, who send monthly contributions. \u201cI used much of my retirement money,\u201d said Merriott. \u201cWhat we are using is excess money that would be inherited. [Our kids] are very happy that we are doing what we are doing.\u201d",

Shareholders in the Washington-based IMF voted to include the yuan, also known as the renminbi, as the fifth member of its special drawing rights (SDR) currency basket alongside the dollar, the Japanese yen, sterling and the euro. Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, said on Monday that including the yuan in the basket was an important milestone in integrating China into the global financial system. \u201cIt is also a recognition of the progress that the Chinese authorities have made in the past years in reforming China\u2019s monetary and financial systems. The continuation and deepening of these efforts will bring about a more robust international monetary and financial system, which in turn will support the growth and stability of China and the global economy,\u201d she said. China had been lobbying for the IMF to add the yuan to its basket of currencies, which it uses to lend to sovereign borrowers. A vote by representatives of the IMF\u2019s member countries to support the move marks a significant milestone for Beijing as it seeks to put the yuan on a par with the US dollar and play a growing role in global markets. Analysts had widely expected the vote in favour of the yuan being added, after IMF staff recommended the move earlier this month. Lagarde endorsed that view, saying the yuan appeared to meet important criteria, including being deemed \u201ca freely usable currency\u201d. The SDR basket is typically reviewed every five years by the IMF\u2019s executive board to ensure it \u201creflects the relative importance of currencies in the global trading and financial systems\u201d. The weightings are adjusted over time and new currencies can be added at those reviews. This decision means the yuan will the basket in October next year. Concluding this latest review, the IMF said: \u201cThe inclusion of the renminbi will enhance the attractiveness of the SDR by diversifying the basket and making it more representative of the world\u2019s major currencies.\u201d",

The service is available in 15 cities worldwide, and in San Francisco it accounts for more than half of the firm\u2019s trips. Uber, which was boosted in October by a UK high court victory over the legality of its app, is launching the service as it awaits the conclusion of a consultation exercise from London\u2019s transport regulator, TfL, which could enforce a crackdown on the firm\u2019s activities.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Aberdeen Asset Management\u2019s funds under management fell by more than \u00a340bn last year as clients grew nervous about shares in China and other emerging markets that the fund manager had built its reputation on. At the end of September, Aberdeen\u2019s assets under management were \u00a3283.7bn compared with \u00a3324.4bn a year earlier \u2013 a fall of 12.5%. Net outflows were \u00a333.9bn and equivalent withdrawals from equity funds increased to \u00a316.4bn from \u00a313bn the year before. Emerging markets, which Aberdeen specialises in, have fallen from favour this year amid concerns about global growth, particularly in China, where the economy is slowing sharply. Investors have also pulled money out of emerging markets in expectation of rising US interest rates, causing the final quarter of Aberdeen\u2019s year to be the worst for outflows from these markets since the financial crisis. Aberdeen\u2019s net fund outflows hit \u00a312.7bn in the fourth quarter, up from almost \u00a310bn in the preceding three months and the 10th straight quarter of net outflows. Shares of Aberdeen, down by a third since April, fell 4% on Monday morning to 321.5p. Underlying pre-tax profit in the year to the end of September rose by \u00a31.3m to \u00a3491.6m and net revenue increased 5% to \u00a31.17bn, helping fund an 8.3% increase in the dividend to 19.5p a share. Martin Gilbert, Aberdeen\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe cyclical correction in Asian and emerging markets and resulting negative investor sentiment has, as expected, led to further flows from our equities business. \u201cWhile we believe the current weakness may have some way to run, the long-term fundamental attractions of investing in these high-growth economies remain compelling for patient investors.\u201d Aberdeen\u2019s prominence increased as it concentrated investments in Asian and other emerging markets. Those bets paid off while developing economies grew and mature markets such as the US and Europe suffered after the financial crisis but China\u2019s slowdown has hit confidence in emerging markets. Gilbert, who founded Aberdeen in 1983, said the company\u2019s decision to broaden its products and expand into developed markets such as the US had helped underpin a solid set of results. Speculation emerged last month that Gilbert might sell Aberdeen but he said the company was determined to stick to its strategy to benefit clients and shareholders. \u201cWe continue to rebalance and diversify the business, to focus on managing our costs and to generate cash and this has helped to mitigate the impact of the outflows we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Gilbert said. Aberdeen said it had found \u00a350m of cost savings it would make later in the current financial year with the full benefit coming through the following year. The company acknowledged its share investments had performed worse than their benchmark indexes but said it would continue to manage funds actively to seek returns that beat benchmarks. Analysts at the broker Numis said investor worries and Aberdeen\u2019s mixed performance combined with uninspiring prospects for earnings meant \u201cwe see no obvious reason to rush to buy today\u201d.",

French Connection will receive \u00a32.4m in compensation from the landlord, which plans to redevelop the site. In a trading update, French Connection said the move would remove \u201congoing trading losses of the store\u201d. The company\u2019s shares, which had halved this year, surged 13% to 34.25p. French Connection will also close three stores in the UK and four in the US by the end of its financial year in January. In April the company said it expected to close seven shops this year but 13 sites are now planned to close this year. At the end of July French Connection had 140 of its own shops and 254 franchised outlets.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s retailers are hoping the flat reaction to Black Friday on the high street, when shoppers preferred trawling the internet to visiting a department store, will pay off on Cyber Monday as the pre-Christmas discounting spree moves online. Imported from the US like its Black Friday cousin, Cyber Monday is forecast to bring in more than \u00a3900m for online retailers \u2013 up nearly a third on last year. By the end of Cyber Monday, total sales over the four-day shopping event will surpass \u00a33bn in the UK, some analysts have predicted. The absence of midnight openings and crowded shops last Friday underlined the role of digital shopping in the multibillion pound outlay by consumers. Springboard, a company which tracks shopper numbers, said online shopping had \u201cstolen the show\u201d over the Black Friday weekend. Footfall across the UK for the weekend was down 9.6% on the year, said Springboard, noting that retailers had spread offers out over several days this year rather than limiting them to Friday. Highlighting a wider trend for internet sales increasing their share of trade, analysts said retailers with reliable web operations were expected to do best out of the long weekend of pre-Christmas discounting. Experts were predicting that online sales on Black Friday would have set a one-day record of just more than \u00a31bn. The only retail destinations to buck the downward trend brought about by internet shopping were retail parks, which over the weekend had a 4.9% rise in footfall on a year ago. Their shopper numbers were down on the Friday but rose on Saturday and Sunday, probably as a result of shoppers picking up purchases bought online using click and collect services. \u201cThe volume of activity in retail stores over the Friday and Saturday of the Black Friday weekend is lower than last year and the evidence clearly points to the fact that much of this is due to a significant increase in shoppers using online to participate in the event,\u201d said Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard. \u201cThe growth of click and collect in supporting store visits should not be underestimated, particularly for retail parks, with many shoppers now opting to buy online but to then visit stores to pick up their purchases.\u201d Online sales on Black Friday are expected to have risen to \u00a31.07bn this year, up 32% on the same big shopping day in 2014, according to predictions from data company Experian and the trade group Interactive Media in Retail Group. If the forecast proves accurate it will be the first time that UK online retail sales exceed \u00a31bn in a single day, they added. They predict Cyber Monday sales of \u00a3943m, up 31% on a year ago. Spending online and in-stores over the four-days was expected to hit \u00a33.49bn, according to figures from the Centre for Retail Research and Voucher Codes. Online retailer Amazon said Black Friday had been its busiest UK day on record with more than 7.4m items sold, at a rate of around 86 a second.",

      "bodyText": "The latest capital expenditure figures show that investment across the board continues to plummet. However, one bright bit of news is that the measure in the May budget, designed to encourage investment in machinery and equipment, looks to be having an impact. Over the past couple of years, every three months the latest private new capital expenditure figures have brought a nice helping of economic gloom. As noted last week, growth in Australia\u2019s economy has gone from being driven by private investment to now being driven by exports. The latest GDP figures, due out on Wednesday, will likely show this to be the case, for once again the capital expenditure figures have shown a stunning fall. Total private capital expenditure fell 6.5% in the September quarter \u2013 the biggest quarterly fall in trend terms ever recorded: The news is a bit better for annual growth. The fall of 17.8% isn\u2019t the worst ever, just the second worst \u2013 only in 1991 has there been a steeper fall. And as usual the big fall is in buildings and structures \u2013 down 21.6% and accounting for 80% of the drop in total investment: But more worrying is the fall in investment in machinery and equipment. While the fall in building and structures is to be expected, given the end of the massive boom in the building of mines and the infrastructure associated with them, the hope was that the non-mining sector would take up some of the slack. And we need that to happen, because so quickly and so greatly has mining investment fallen, the non-mining sector is now the larger: But the fall is across the board \u2013 mining, manufacturing and the \u201cother selected industries\u201d sector, which takes in all other industries (with a few key exceptions). The figures don\u2019t include any investment for health, education and public administration \u2013 mostly because they involve historically and predominantly public investment: This would suggest the transition from the mining boom is rather bust, and even more so when we look purely at the growth of investment in machinery and equipment. While the manufacturing sector saw a 14.8% rise in such investment, the value of that investment is only about 18% that of other selected industries, which fell 0.6% in the past year. All up in the non-mining sectors, the rise was just 1.5%: So there isn\u2019t a heck of a lot of joy looking at what has happened in the past year. But the capital expenditure figures also provide a glimpse into what firms expect to do in the future. The latest figures contain the fourth estimate for capital expenditure in the 2015-16 financial year. On first blush, the overall news is not good. The latest estimates would still see a 20% fall in annual investment, with mining sector investment falling 36%: And even when we focus on the non-mining sector, the news looks on the surface quite poor \u2013 with the fourth estimate 2% down on the same estimate last year: But what is happening is the outlook is improving. As a general rule, each estimate sees an increase in the amount expected to be invested, but since the announcement in the May budget to offer a $20,000 instant asset write-off for small businesses, which is forecast to cost $1.8bn over four years, the expectation of investment in machinery and equipment has become significantly more rosy. The March estimate (known as estimate two) for investment in machinery and equipment by the non-mining sectors in 2015-16 was $27.02bn, the next estimate in the June quarter (estimate three) was up to $31.589bn. The latest (estimate four) has investment worth $36.007bn. This latest estimate is 14% above that of estimate three and it is 33% above that of estimate two \u2013 both of which represent the biggest such jumps since 1997-98. The worry with the instant asset write off was that it would just be a sugar hit \u2013 businesses would quickly buy machinery, new cars, etc, and then it would tail off. The latest figures suggest the hit is continuing to come, with firms much more optimistic about their investment decisions than they were six months ago. That is undoubtedly good news, and probably small comfort to Joe Hockey and Bruce Billson, the two ministers responsible for the policy who are both no longer in the cabinet \u2013 and, with Billson\u2019s recent announcement to quit politics, soon neither will even be in parliament. It is ironic for a treasurer who loved to preach austerity that, in the end, his most successful budgetary measure was a stimulatory one.",

      "bodyText": "Campaigners are urging David Cameron to use a meeting with leaders of Britain\u2019s overseas territories this week to demand a crackdown on tax dodging, corruption and money laundering. Leading charities, including Oxfam and ActionAid, have written to the prime minister to highlight the \u201cmurky\u201d world of shell companies that set up in territories such as the British Virgin and Cayman Islands, thereby depriving developing countries of billions of dollars in tax revenues. Before the government\u2019s meetings with the heads of overseas territories in London on Tuesday and Wednesday, the 11 NGOs remind Cameron of his commitment to tackle the abuse of anonymous companies and his promise in the Tory\u2019s election manifesto to \u201ccontinue to lead the world on tax and transparency\u201d. The letter, seen by the Guardian, says: \u201cThe UK-linked overseas territories, including the British Virgin and Cayman Islands, are leading international suppliers of anonymity, enabling many to hide from the authorities, especially in the world\u2019s poorest countries. Tax havens are not just facilitating tax dodging, they also facilitate corruption.\u201d The campaigners praise Cameron\u2019s efforts to stop the UK\u2019s property market from becoming a safe haven for corrupt money but they express disappointment about the lack of meaningful change on tax transparency in Britain\u2019s overseas territories and crown dependencies. \u201cThe truth about the real sources and owners of the vast sums of money flowing into these UK-linked jurisdictions remains as murky as ever. The failure of these territories to heed your 2013 call for \u2018proper companies, proper taxes, proper rules\u2019, is a national embarrassment and undermines UK leadership on this, and other fronts, in tackling global poverty and corruption,\u201d says the letter, whose signatories also include the heads of Christian Aid and Transparency International UK. Cameron has repeatedly urged overseas territories to introduce central public registers of company ownership, so that law enforcement agencies can trace criminals behind firms that are currently anonymous. But his calls have met with resistance in some territories. On the eve of the UK-hosted G8 summit in 2013, Cameron secured an agreement from Britain\u2019s overseas territories and crown dependencies that they would sign up to a new clampdown on tax evasion. At the summit, he made improving international tax compliance a key issue. But his 10-point plan to tackle global tax evasion met a hostile reception from campaigners after he failed to persuade his G8 counterparts to make any new binding commitments. In their letter, the NGOs tell Cameron that the failure of tax havens to heed his calls on transparency is cheating people in developing countries out of funding for hospitals, schools and roads. The campaigners want overseas territories, which are self-governing but partially subject to UK law, to be upfront about who owns, controls and benefits from companies set up there and to provide publicly available central registries. \u201cShining a light on the shadowy world of anonymous shell companies will help governments from Uganda to the UK claim what\u2019s rightfully owed to them, and help citizens to hold governments to account for spending this money on vital public services,\u201d the letter says. The letter comes after Cameron accused some British overseas territories and crown dependencies of not doing enough to tackle tax evasion and money laundering. On a trip to the Caribbean in September, he told the Jamaican parliament that he was still not happy with the way some territories were resisting financial transparency, without naming any.",

Tax havens are not just facilitating tax dodging, they also facilitate corruption.\u201d</p> <p>The campaigners praise Cameron\u2019s efforts to stop the UK\u2019s property market from becoming a safe haven for corrupt money but they express disappointment about the lack of meaningful change on tax transparency in Britain\u2019s overseas territories and crown dependencies. </p> <p>\u201cThe truth about the real sources and owners of the vast sums of money flowing into these UK-linked jurisdictions remains as murky as ever. The failure of these territories to heed your 2013 call for \u2018proper companies, proper taxes, proper rules\u2019, is a national embarrassment and undermines UK leadership on this, and other fronts, in tackling global poverty and corruption,\u201d says the letter, whose signatories also include the heads of Christian Aid and Transparency International UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/19/tax-havens-money-cayman-islands-jersey-offshore-accounts\">Follow the money: inside the world's tax havens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cameron has repeatedly urged overseas territories to introduce central public registers of company ownership, so that law enforcement agencies can trace criminals behind firms that are currently anonymous.
