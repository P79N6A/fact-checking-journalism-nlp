      "bodyText": "The debate about Britain\u2019s railways is missing something important. Amid the talk of traingate, overcrowding, prices and nationalisation, there has been little mention of safety. This is important, because the safety record for Britain\u2019s rail network is staggeringly good. It is now nine years since a passenger on one of Britain\u2019s trains died in an accident. The last death occurred when a Virgin Pendolino derailed in Cumbria. A brief glance at the history of Britain\u2019s railways shows this run is without precedent. It also compares favourably with the rest of the world. The latest annual safety report by the Office of Rail and Road shows Britain has the third safest railway in Europe since 2010, based on workforce and passenger fatalities per billion kilometers of train journeys. Only Luxembourg and Ireland have a better safety record. Out of Europe\u2019s 10 biggest railway networks, Britain has by far the safest. The train crashes near Bad Aibling in Germany in February, which killed 12 people, and in Italy in July, which killed 23, are a reminder that tragedy is never far away. The ORR report also shows that the for the first time ever there was no fatalities among workers on the railway in the last year, which is another landmark. This look at Britain\u2019s safety record is not mean to say that the existing system of Network Rail managing the infrastructure and private companies managing the trains is flawless. After the railway was privatised in the mid-1990s there was a string of major accidents at Southall, Ladbroke Grove, Hatfield, and Potters Bar. The Hatfield crash led to the collapse of Railtrack, and a lot needed to be learned from those accidents. Prices are too high, the government needs to invest more in new infrastructure, and some trains are overcrowded. However, this safety record shows that Britain is doing something right and the existing system is not compromising safety. That is something to build on. Sports Direct opens up Who fancies a day out in Shirebrook? Sports Direct is to host an \u201copen day\u201d on 7 September in an attempt to show that working at its warehouse in the Midlands isn\u2019t like working in a Victorian sweatshop after all. Normally annual general meetings are for shareholders only, with journalists allowed in depending on the mood of the company. This year, though, Sports Direct will let members of the public into the meeting. After the AGM, guests will be taken on a tour of the Shirebrook facility before the board makes a presentation about their strategy, including their \u201cpeople strategy\u201d. Guests have even been invited to submit questions to the board, which includes founder Mike Ashley. There is a condition, however, attendees and questions must be registered in advance, so we will see whether Sports Direct is prepared to take on difficult questions from its most ardent critics. This is clearly an attempt by Sports Direct to fightback against criticism of its working practices and corporate governance, with the latest drama revolving around the the sportswear retailer paying an obscure company owned by Ashley\u2019s brother to deliver online orders outside the UK. However, the open day is a welcome alternative to the silence from Sports Direct in the past. Ashley normally sits through the company\u2019s annual meeting in silence and with a glum face, leaving the talking to the other directors. He may do the same again this time, but by engaging with its critics, such as trade unions, Sports Direct can learn more about what is workers think of working in Shirebrook. Hopefully MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee who heavily criticised Sports Direct and Ashley in a report on working practises at the company will attend. Actions speak loud than words though. Ashley was contrite when he gave evidence to the parliamentary committee, but trade unions representing the workers at Shirebrook are still pushing for change. Defending Apple Before 23 June, Barack Obama led the calls for Britain to stay in the European Union. But now the US Treasury department is referring to Brussels as a \u201csupranational tax authority\u201d. Its comment is in relation to the European commission looking into whether to hit Apple with a demand for billions of euros in taxes. The language from the US is strong, which is unfortunate given that a uniform global approach is needed to take on tax avoidance. If only the US would talk to companies in such strong terms, the commission would not have to get involved in investigations in the first place.",

    "webTitle": "EpiPen CEO hiked prices on two dozen products and got a 671% pay raise", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The executive of the pharmaceutical company that hiked the prices of two dozen drugs, including EpiPen, received a 671% pay increase over the past nine years. Heather Bresch, chief executive officer of Mylan, came under public scrutiny this week after reports that since acquiring rights to EpiPen in 2007, the company had implemented a series of gradual price increases inflating the price of the drug from $56.64 to $317.82, a 461% increase in cost . During that same time, Bresch went from being Mylan\u2019s chief operating officer to president to chief executive and saw her pay rise $2,453,456 to $18,931,068, a 671% increase. When Mylan first acquired Merck KGaA in 2007, Bresch oversaw the integration of its 400 products. Among those products was EpiPen, which is used to quickly deliver a proper dose of epinephrine to those suffering from anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is when an allergic reaction causes one\u2019s airways to swell and close. In a 2015 interview with Fortune, Bresch described EpiPen as \u201cmy baby\u201d. Under her management, EpiPen went from bringing in $200m a year in sales to becoming Mylan\u2019s first billion-dollar product. Following the outcry over the increase in EpiPen\u2019s prices, Bresch, who is the daughter of West Virginia senator Joe Manchin, could be called on to justify Mylan\u2019s pricing before the US Congress. Her father does not sit on the Senate judiciary committee, which would most likely hear her testimony. Mylan has hiked prices of other products as well, according to a June report by a Wells Fargo senior analyst David Maris. \u201cMylan has raised the prices more than 20% on 24 products, and more than 100% on seven products,\u201d he wrote. Among the products whose prices were hiked over the past six months were: Ursodiol, a drug used to treat gallstones, saw its price increase by 542% Dicyclomine, a drug used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, saw its price increase by 400% Tolterodine, a drug used to treat overactive bladders, saw its price increase by 56% The Guardian has reached out to Mylan to confirm these hikes. In his report, Maris noted that the price hikes could draw \u201cgreater regulatory scrutiny and headline risk\u201d. \u201cMylan\u2019s business model is not today, nor has it ever been, premised on price hikes,\u201d Nina Devlin, Mylan\u2019s spokeswoman, said in June. She described Maris\u2019s analysis as \u201cflawed\u201d and said it focused on a small selection of the company\u2019s 1,400-plus products. The fact that EpiPen is a household item for those suffering from severe allergies is perhaps why this price increase is drawing so much public ire. \u201cOne reason I think the EpiPen situation is getting so much attention compared to other cases is a lot of the high-cost drugs are used by patients who are very sick, cancer patients, multiple sclerosis. These are patients that actually don\u2019t end up paying a lot of these costs out of pocket because they hit their out of pocket maximums and deductibles pretty quickly,\u201d explained David H Howard, a health economist at the department of health policy and management at Emory University. \u201cBut for EpiPen, a lot of people who are using this, or might use it, are pretty healthy. They don\u2019t have a lot of other health conditions or health needs so this is their major expense and they end up paying for a lot of of it out their own pocket,\u201d Howard told the Guardian. Since the price hike was reported, a number of lawmakers have called on the company to make its products affordable. \u201cDue to Mylan\u2019s virtual monopoly of the epinephrine auto-injector market and its unique life-saving attribute, it is crucial that your product remains affordable for all Americans,\u201d Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthalwrote in a letter to Mylan. \u201cTherefore, I demand that Mylan take immediate action to lower the price of EpiPens for all Americans that rely on this product for their health and safety.\u201d Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton put out a statement on Wednesday calling on Mylan to reduce the price of EpiPen, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients.\u201d According to Citigroup analysts Liav Abraham and Eugene Kim, there is \u201clittle regulatory action that can be implemented to compel Mylan to lower the price of EpiPen\u201d. However, increased scrutiny and an appearance before the Senate judiciary committee could lead to \u201cself-regulation\u201d, they wrote in a note to investors. They noted that over the past 12 months, EpiPen underwent two 15% price increases. Earlier this year, another pharmaceutical executive was in the hot seat in front of the US Congress: Martin Shkreli, former chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals. Shkreli became notorious after Turing increased prices of its HIV medicine Daraprim by 5,000%. The price of the drug went from $13.50 to $750 overnight. In a recent interview with NBC, Shkreli said that he too considered gradual hikes in price \u2013 akin to how Mylan proceeded \u2013 but had instead decided \u201cto come out and say: \u2018This is our desired price\u2019\u201d. Prior to being acquired by Mylan in 2007, the price of EpiPen went up 3%-4% on several occasions. Price increases under Mylan ranged from 5% in 2008 to 20% in 2009. Shkreli went on to describe Mylan as \u201cvultures\u201d and asked: \u201cWhat drives this company\u2019s moral compass?\u201d Profit seems to be the answer. According to Mylan\u2019s second quarter earnings report, its total revenue so far this year was $2.56bn, up 8% compared to last year. Its net sales in the \u201cspecialty third party\u201d category, which includes Mylan\u2019s EpiPen, increased by $100.6m or 33% during the three months ending in June 2016, compared to the same period last year. Some of that increase was due to higher EpiPen sales, the company said in its earnings report.",

      "body": "<p>The executive of the pharmaceutical company that hiked the prices of two dozen drugs, including EpiPen, received a 671% pay increase over the past nine years.</p> <p>Heather Bresch, chief executive officer of Mylan, came under public scrutiny this week after reports that since acquiring rights to EpiPen in 2007, the company had implemented a series of gradual price increases inflating the price of the drug from $56.64 to $317.82, a 461% increase in cost . During that same time, Bresch went from being Mylan\u2019s chief operating officer to president to chief executive and saw her pay rise $2,453,456 <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/mylan-execs-gave-themselves-raises-they-hiked-epipen-prices-n636591?cid=sm_fb\">to $18,931,068</a>, a 671% increase. </p> <p>When Mylan first acquired Merck KGaA in 2007, Bresch oversaw the integration of its 400 products. Among those products was EpiPen, which is used to quickly deliver a proper dose of epinephrine to those suffering from anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is when an allergic reaction causes one\u2019s airways to swell and close. In <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/11/mylan-ceo-heather-bresch/\">a 2015 interview</a> with Fortune, Bresch described EpiPen as \u201cmy baby\u201d. Under her management, EpiPen went from bringing in $200m a year in sales to becoming Mylan\u2019s first billion-dollar product.</p> <p>Following the outcry over the increase in EpiPen\u2019s prices, Bresch, who is the daughter of West Virginia senator Joe Manchin, could be called on to justify Mylan\u2019s pricing before the US Congress. Her father does not sit on the Senate judiciary committee, which would most likely hear her testimony. </p> <p>Mylan has hiked prices of other products as well, according to <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/10/mylan-shares-slide-after-analysts-raise-concerns-over-pricing-strategies.html\">a June report</a> by a Wells Fargo senior analyst David Maris.</p> <p>\u201cMylan has raised the prices more than 20% on 24 products, and more than 100% on seven products,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/epipen-maker-also-hiked-prices-slew-other-medications-n636981\">he wrote</a>. <br></p> <p>Among the products whose prices were hiked over the past six months were: </p> <ul> <li>Ursodiol, a drug used to treat gallstones, saw its price increase by 542%</li> <li>Dicyclomine, a drug used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, saw its price increase by 400%<br></li> <li>Tolterodine, a drug used to treat overactive bladders, saw its price increase by 56% <br></li> </ul> <p>The Guardian has reached out to Mylan to confirm these hikes. </p> <p>In his report, Maris noted that the price hikes could draw \u201cgreater regulatory scrutiny and headline risk\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cMylan\u2019s business model is not today, nor has it ever been, premised on price hikes,\u201d Nina Devlin, Mylan\u2019s spokeswoman, <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/10/mylan-shares-slide-after-analysts-raise-concerns-over-pricing-strategies.html\">said in June</a>. She described Maris\u2019s analysis as \u201cflawed\u201d and said it focused on a small selection of the company\u2019s 1,400-plus products. </p> <p>The fact that EpiPen is a household item for those suffering from severe allergies is perhaps why this price increase is drawing so much public ire.</p> <p>\u201cOne reason I think the EpiPen situation is getting so much attention compared to other cases is a lot of the high-cost drugs are used by patients who are very sick, cancer patients, multiple sclerosis. These are patients that actually don\u2019t end up paying a lot of these costs out of pocket because they hit their out of pocket maximums and deductibles pretty quickly,\u201d explained David H Howard, a health economist at the department of health policy and management at Emory University. </p> <p>\u201cBut for EpiPen, a lot of people who are using this, or might use it, are pretty healthy. They don\u2019t have a lot of other health conditions or health needs so this is their major expense and they end up paying for a lot of of it out their own pocket,\u201d Howard told the Guardian. </p> <p>Since the price hike was reported, a number of lawmakers have called on the company to make its products affordable.</p> <p>\u201cDue to Mylan\u2019s virtual monopoly of the epinephrine auto-injector market and its unique life-saving attribute, it is crucial that your product remains affordable for all Americans,\u201d Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal<a href=\"https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-demands-mylan-lower-price-for-life-saving-epipen\">wrote in a letter</a> to Mylan. \u201cTherefore, I demand that Mylan take immediate action to lower the price of EpiPens for all Americans that rely on this product for their health and safety.\u201d</p> <p>Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton put out a statement on Wednesday calling on Mylan to reduce the price of EpiPen, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong when drug companies put profits ahead of patients.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.barrons.com/stockstowatchtoday/2016/08/23/mylan-in-epipen-controversy-shades-of-valeant/\">According to Citigroup analysts</a> Liav Abraham and Eugene Kim, there is \u201clittle regulatory action that can be implemented to compel Mylan to lower the price of EpiPen\u201d. However, increased scrutiny and an appearance before the Senate judiciary committee could lead to \u201cself-regulation\u201d, they wrote in a note to investors. They noted that over the past 12 months, EpiPen underwent two 15% price increases.</p> <p>Earlier this year, another pharmaceutical executive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/martin-shkreli-refuses-to-testify-congress-drug-daraprim\">was in the hot seat</a> in front of the US Congress: Martin Shkreli, former chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals. Shkreli became notorious after Turing increased prices of its HIV medicine Daraprim by 5,000%. The price of the drug went from $13.50 to $750 overnight. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/feb/04/martin-shkreli-congress-daraprim-hearing-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4gexn\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2450948\"            data-video-name=\"Former drug executive Martin Shkreli calls Congress \u2018imbeciles\u2019 after hearing \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/2/4/1454609745409/KP_1711356_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56b39560e4b05b93c48cd251\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/2/4/1454609745409/KP_1711356_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/02/04/160204MartinShkreliCongress_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/02/04/160204MartinShkreliCongress_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/02/04/160204MartinShkreliCongress.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/02/04/160204MartinShkreliCongress_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/02/04/160204MartinShkreliCongress_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/feb/04/martin-shkreli-congress-daraprim-hearing-video\">Former drug executive Martin Shkreli calls Congress \u2018imbeciles\u2019 after hearing</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In a recent <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/martin-shkreli-weighs-epipen-scandal-calls-drug-makers-vultures-n634451\">interview with NBC</a>, Shkreli said that he too considered gradual hikes in price \u2013 akin to how Mylan proceeded \u2013 but had instead decided \u201cto come out and say: \u2018This is our desired price\u2019\u201d. </p> <p>Prior to being acquired by Mylan in 2007, the price of EpiPen went up 3%-4% on several occasions. Price increases under Mylan ranged from 5% in 2008 to 20% in 2009. </p> <p>Shkreli went on to describe Mylan as \u201cvultures\u201d and asked: \u201cWhat drives this company\u2019s moral compass?\u201d</p> <p>Profit seems to be the answer. </p> <p>According to Mylan\u2019s second quarter earnings report, its total revenue so far this year was $2.56bn, up 8% compared to last year.

Some of that increase was due to higher EpiPen sales, the company said in its <a href=\"http://apps.shareholder.com/sec/viewerContent.aspx?companyid=ABEA-2LQZGT&amp;docid=11535413\">earnings report</a>.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Most European markets ended the day higher, albeit not showing substantial gains as investors remained cautious ahead of any comments from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen about US interest rates in her speech on Friday. But the FTSE 100 missed out, dragged down by mining shares after a fall in profits at Glencore. The weaker oil price in the wake of an unexpected rise in US crude stocks also hit sentiment. Brent is now down 1.9% at $49 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate is 3% lower at $46.65. The final scores on the markets showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 32.73 points or 0.48% at 6835.78 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.28% to 10622.97 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.32% at 4435.47 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was 0.68% better at 16891.63 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.87% at 8655.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.01% to 567.94 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 27 points or 0.15%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. French unemployment has fallen in July, but not quite as much as expected: Elsewhere, Iceland\u2019s central bank has cut interest rates for the first time since December 2014, citing concerns about low inflation. Reducing its key interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to 5.25%, the bank said: The inflation outlook has improved since the Bank\u2019s last forecast. If the exchange rate remains unchanged, the outlook is for inflation to remain below target until early 2017. According to the forecast, it will edge upwards when import prices stop declining and the effects of the currency appreciation subside. Inflation will rise more slowly than previously forecast, however, and will not be as high as was previously projected. If the exchange rate continues to rise, and other things being equal, inflation will be lower than is provided for in the baseline forecast... Whether interest rates will be lowered further or need to be raised again will depend on economic developments and on the success of the capital account liberalisation process. The recent signs that the UK economy is - so far - holding up after the Brexit vote continue to support the pound. Sterling is now at a three week high against the dollar, up 0.35% at $1.3235, while it has climbed 0.8% against the euro to \u20ac1.1762. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Crude prices took a knock today as the US posted its fourth inventories build-up in five weeks. Despite being in so-called driving season, the build-up of surplus oil means that domestic demand is not keeping up with supply, which has become increasingly reliant upon international imports as output falls. On the oil price, David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco, said: The EIA reported a 2.5 million barrel build in crude stocks against expectations of a 500,000 drawdown. WTI and Brent slumped on the report which was consistent with last night\u2019s American Petroleum Institute release... Crude oil has been amongst the most volatile markets this week as investors prepare themselves for Janet Yellen\u2019s speech on Friday at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium On Tuesday it whipsawed from negative to positive territory on a story that Iran was prepared to \u2018support joint action to prop up the oil market\u2019. However, this headline missed out on another crucial quote from the (anonymous) source which said that even if an agreement was reached to freeze output, there was very little chance that anyone would stick to it. This latter point is entirely consistent with previous attempts by OPEC members to manipulate the oil market. Even in the days when the group operated as a cartel and brought in quotas for members, nobody stuck to them Oil took another lurch lower first thing this morning after yet another headline. In this an Iranian oil ministry official wasn\u2019t prepared to confirm that Iran would even attend the meeting in Algeria next month, suggesting a repeat of April\u2019s disastrous talks in Doha. Brent crude has fallen 1.7% to $49.09 a barrel following the unexpected rise in US oil stocks. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - is down 2.6% at $46.91. Oil prices are under pressure again after a surprise rise in US crude stocks, suggesting lack of demand and excess supply. Weekly crude stocks rose 2.5m barrels to 523.59m, compared to expectations of a 0.5m fall, according to the Energy Information Administration. Weekly gasoline stocks climbed 36,000 barrels to 232.7m, rather than the expected 1.2m decline. Another factor for the Federal Reserve to consider when contemplating an interest rate rise. US existing home sale fell by a higher than expected 3.2% to an annualised 5.39m units in July, according to the National Association of Realtors. Analysts had expected a smaller dip to 5.51m. The association said: Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, says existing sales fell off track in July after steadily climbing the last four months. \u201cSeverely restrained inventory and the tightening grip it\u2019s putting on affordability is the primary culprit for the considerable sales slump throughout much of the country last month,\u201d he said. \u201cRealtors are reporting diminished buyer traffic because of the scarce number of affordable homes on the market, and the lack of supply is stifling the efforts of many prospective buyers attempting to purchase while mortgage rates hover at historical lows.\u201d A Bank of England bond buying programme for medium term gilts has seen increased demand. The Bank received offers worth 3.1 times the number it wanted to buy of 7 to 15 year gilts. Last week the figure was 2.85 times. In other words the Bank received total offers of \u00a33.625bn and accepted \u00a31.169bn. It may be a couple of days until Janet Yellen, the chair of the US Federal Reserve, makes her speech at the Jackson Hole symposium but investors remain cautious ahead of the event. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dipped 20 points or 0.11% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both opened marginally lower. Further weakness in the oil price ahead of the latest US crude inventory figures, due later, is adding to the uncertainty. Crude saw a sharp spike on Tuesday afternoon following reports that Iran might back plans to support the oil price at next month\u2019s meeting of producers. But growing doubts about the chances of this happening, along with a rise in oil stocks reported by the American Petroleum Institute, saw the price fall back. Here is our full story on the Scottish government\u2019s spending and earnings figures for 2015-16: The Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (Gers) figures showed that during 2015-16 the country\u2019s tax receipts were \u00a3400 less than the UK average at \u00a310,000, after several decades during which oil had pushed Scottish tax receipts above the UK level. The gap between Scottish tax revenues and spending had also grown sharply, Gers revealed. While overall tax receipts fell by \u00a3400 a head, the Scottish and UK governments spent \u00a31,200 a head more on public services in the country, and on Scotland\u2019s share of UK and overseas spending. Compared with spending at UK level, that led to a gulf of \u00a31,600 a head between what was raised in taxes and spent in Scotland. Yet overall government spending as a share of the economy increased again to reach nearly 44% of Scotland\u2019s GDP, compared with 40% at UK level. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s First Minister, has commented on the Scottish public finances data published this morning. She said the figures - which showed Scotland\u2019s North Sea revenues fell 97% in 2015-16 to just \u00a360m - were difficult and the drop in oil prices meant Scotland had \u201csuffered an economic shock which has had an impact on our fiscal position\u201d. She added: It is a challenge we have had for some time now \u2013 how to grow and diversify our onshore economy. I accept Scotland faces, whatever our constitutional arrangements, a very challenging fiscal position [but] the fundamentals of our economy are strong. Mickey Levy, chief US and Asia economist at German bank Berenberg, has some personal insight to offer on Jackson Hole. He attended the meeting every year for 23 years with his last one in 2013 and says the media is missing the point by focusing on Yellen\u2019s speech and the timing of the next US rate rise. The purpose of the symposium is to get leading monetary policymakers to focus on and discuss specific broader issues critical to the conduct of monetary policy. It is not designed to focus on the next FOMC meeting or the timing of Fed policy changes, but that\u2019s what the media who cover the event hype, so that\u2019s what will be reported. Here is how it works according to Levy, who says the format, the venue, and food menus have remained virtually the same for the past 25 years: Nearly a year before every meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City picks a topic and a handful of academics to prepare serious research papers. At the symposium, the papers are presented at panels chaired by leading global central bankers (including Fed members) and each paper is critiqued by formal discussants. Symposium participants are then able to ask questions and make comments. The papers and Yellen\u2019s speech are embargoed until they are presented. There is no wandering around the hallways\u2014everybody is in the meeting, which is long and formally structured. Yellen is expected to kick off proceedings on Friday morning: The Fed Chair gives the opening remarks at the symposium on Friday morning, 8am Mountain Time (10am Eastern Time). There is no Q&amp;A session following the Chair\u2019s presentation. Often, the Chair\u2019s presentation covers the general topic of the papers that are being presented. The last panel of the symposium, late Saturday morning, will involve four leading central bankers and policymakers commenting and discussing more current issues facing monetary policy. This will include a Fed member and an ECB member. US traders are treading water as they await the annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Representatives from central banks will gather on Thursday but the main proceedings get underway on Friday. The event is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and has been since 1978. Prominent central bankers, finance ministers, and academics from around the world gather to discuss the themes around a pre-decided topic. This year\u2019s meeting has the catchy title: Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future. The formal agenda is not published until Thursday evening in Jackson Hole (1am Friday morning UK time). But we do know that US Fed chair Janet Yellen will be giving a speech on Friday. The speech is eagerly awaited by investors looking for clues as to when the Fed will next hike rates. The Federal Open Market Committee appears to be divided on the subject, leaving investors confused and uncertain. They will look to Yellen to shed some light when she gives her speech, entitled, \u201cThe Fed\u2019s Monetary Policy Toolkit\u201d. The Bank of England\u2019s representatives will be Minouche Shafik, deputy governor for markets and banking, and Kristin Forbes, an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee. Wall Street is expected to open modestly higher: The FTSE 100 is lagging other European indices, down -0.2% or 10 points at 6,858. The FTSE is being dragged lower by the mining companies, which have been hit by the sliding price of oil and other commodities. Glencore is the biggest faller, down 4.3% after reporting a sharp drop in first-half profits. Other major markets are rising: Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.5% at 10,641 France\u2019s CAC: +0.6% at 4,450 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 16,918 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.8% at 8,646 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.5% at 345 Returning to Scotland and the 97% drop in North Sea revenue in 2015-16... The figures were published as part of the Government Expenditure &amp; Revenue Scotland 2015-16. As well as plunging oil revenues as North Sea fields mature and the oil price weakens, the data showed the deficit (the difference between what the government earned and spent) in Scotland was \u00a314.8bn in 2015-16. That amounted to 9.5% of gross domestic product. It compares with a UK deficit of \u00a375.3bn, or 4% of GDP. The huge drop in North Sea revenues last year creates a potential headache for Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s First Minister and leader of the SNP, who is considering a second referendum on Scottish independence following the Brexit vote. It makes it easier for those opposed to Scottish independence to argue that Scotland\u2019s economy would be better off if it remains in the UK. However, Sturgeon has referred to Scottish government figures that forecast Brexit could cost Scotland\u2019s economy as much as \u00a311.2bn by 2030, and cut public revenues by \u00a33.7bn. Oil prices are down following an unexpected increase in US crude stocks. The rise in stocks has revived fears over a supply glut. Brent crude is down 1% or 52 cents at $49.46 a barrel, after touching an intraday low of $49.07. US West Texas Intermediate crude fell 80 cents or 1.7% to $47.30 a barrel. Figures published on Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute showed US stocks had risen by 4.5 million barrels in the week ending 19 August. Analysts expected a 455,000 fall in the number of barrels. The US government will publish its own weekly crude stocks data later today. The pound is rising, up 0.3% against the dollar at $1.3230. It is up 0.5% against the euro, at \u20ac1.1728. It seems that speculators are trimming their bets against sterling after much of the economic data relating to July and August suggests the Brexit vote has had a limited impact so far. The Scottish government\u2019s North Sea revenues collapsed in 2015-16 to just \u00a360m from \u00a31.8bn a year earlier. As the graphic below shows, it is a far cry from the rewards reaped by Scotland in 2008-09, when North Sea revenues were \u00a311.6bn. The \u00a360m revenue last year was the smallest on record since the Scottish parliament was convened in 1998-99. It represented a 78.5% share of North Sea revenues. The North Sea is a mature oil asset, meaning much of it has already been extracted with the remaining oil more costly and complex to get out of the ground. Its decline comes at a time when oil prices have fallen sharply, hitting revenue with a double blow. My colleague Sean Farrell has obtained the memo sent by Lloyds boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio to the bank\u2019s staff. Here is the message in full: Having returned to work I wanted to use the opportunity to address the recent media coverage of my private life. As you may have read, my expenses were reviewed in light of speculation by certain newspapers and the Group has confirmed that they are fully compliant. As you\u2019d expect, I pay for my personal expenses whilst away and only reclaim what is a business expense. My personal life is obviously a private matter as it is for anyone else. But I deeply regret being the cause of so much adverse publicity and the damage that has been done to the Group\u2019s reputation. It has detracted from the great work which you do for our customers on a daily basis and from the major accomplishments of the past five years. This includes the Government shareholding having reduced from over 40% to around 9% with over \u00a316 billion plus dividends having been returned to taxpayers. More broadly I have been a strong advocate of expecting the highest professional standards from everyone at the bank, and that includes me. I will continue to strive to meet those standards. Having the highest professional standards raises the bar against which we are judged and as I have always said we must recognise that mistakes will be made. I don\u2019t expect anyone to get everything right all the time. The important point being how we learn from those mistakes and the decisions and actions we take afterward. As we look forward, it is your hard work over the last five years returning the Group to financial health that means we are best placed among our peers to continue supporting the UK economy and to help Britain prosper. We chose to focus on helping the UK economy \u2013 in particular through our support for first time buyers, small businesses and UK corporates \u2013 and as a result by choice, our future is inextricably linked with the future success of the UK economy. The extended period of low interest rates that we now face has created uncertainties for the UK economy and new challenges for the Group. And as a UK focused bank we are not immune to the factors likely to shape the UK economic outlook, but I believe we will be well positioned to meet them. With that in mind please be assured that I am as committed as ever to leading the Group forward to deliver our strategy and to meet our future ambitions. Thank you again for your messages of support over the last few weeks. I have greatly appreciated them. Best wishes Ant\u00f3nio Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, believes UK house prices will fall in 2016 and 2017 as greater uncertainty surrounding Brexit creeps in. We suspect that house prices could ease back by around 3% over the latter months of 2016 and there could well be a further 5% drop in 2017. We believe housing market activity is likely to be limited over the coming months and prices will weaken as heightened uncertainty following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU weighs down on consumer confidence and willingness to engage in major transactions, and also hampers economic activity. The fundamentals for house buyers look likely to soften over the coming months with unemployment rising and purchasing power softening. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics has a different interpretation of the BBA figures, arguing there are clear signs that Brexit is weighing on consumers\u2019 minds. July\u2019s mortgage approvals data bring clear evidence that the Brexit vote has made households reluctant to undertake major financial commitments. Following a 5% month-to-month fall in June, approvals fell a further 5.3% in July, leaving them at their lowest since January 2015 and down 19% year-over-year. The decline in approvals corresponds closely with the drop in RICS\u2019 measure of new buyer enquiries and indicators of consumer confidence, so the slowdown seems demand led. Housing transactions, which only edged down in July, have yet to register the full adverse impact of the Brexit vote. The BBA\u2019s July data are the first set of borrowing figures since the Brexit vote on 23 June. Rebecca Harding, BBA chief economist, says despite the drop in mortgage approvals the figures overall suggest the impact of the vote has had little negative impact so far. A breakdown of the numbers reinforces the picture that consumers have so far shrugged off Brexit uncertainty. Consumer credit was 6% higher in July than a year earlier, reflecting strong retail sales and - in the case of personal loans and overdrafts - low interest rates. Borrowing by companies meanwhile increased by \u00a32.3bn in July after a small fall in June. Harding: The data does not currently suggest borrowing patterns have been significantly affected by the Brexit vote, but it is still early days. Many borrowing decisions will also have been taken before the referendum. We are also clearly still a nation of shoppers and the Brexit vote has done nothing to change the fact that we use credit cards for short-term purchases. Strong retail sales figures appear closely associated with strong consumer credit growth. Businesses also appear to be borrowing as usual: the upward trend that characterised the first few months of this year is continuing. June\u2019s data looks like a blip, probably caused by pre-Brexit nervousness. But it is too early to tell how the data over the next few months will reflect the result of the decision to leave the EU. Britain\u2019s high-street banks approved the fewest mortgages since January 2015 in July. Mortgage approvals for house purchase (excluding remortgages) fell 19% last month compared with a year earlier, to 37,662 according to the British Bankers Association. Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, is expected to apologise to staff today following allegations that he had an affair with a senior academic. The married father of three is expected to send a message to the bank\u2019s 75,000 staff expressing \u201cdeep regret\u201d for any embarrassment and reputational damage to the bank. He is not expected to resign. At 9.30 the Scottish government will publish figures that are expected to show a sharp decline in tax revenues from the oil and gas sector, following the drop in oil prices. Opponents of Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish independence are likely to jump on any weakness in the figures as a reason why Scotland\u2019s economic future would be more secure as part of the UK. But Sturgeon has argued that Brexit could cost the Scottish economy as much as \u00a311bn by 2030. The pound is roughly unchanged this morning, down 0.1% against the dollar at $1.3182. It\u2019s a similar story against the euro, with the pound down 0.01% \u20ac1.1671. WPP is the FTSE 100\u2019s top riser this morning after the world\u2019s largest advertising group said full-year revenue was likely to grow more than previously expected. The top of the table this morning: And at the other end of the table, the miners are among the biggest fallers: Here is our full story on WPP\u2019s better-than-expected first-half results: Europe\u2019s major markets are down in early trading: FTSE 100: -0.2% at 6,852 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.5% at 10,545 France\u2019s CAC: -0.5% at 4,399 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.3% at 8,557 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.02% at 16,755 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 343 Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the world\u2019s largest advertising group WPP, says he is still worried about the potential fallout from the Brexit vote. Sorrell was firmly in the remain camp in the run-up to the 23 June referendum and told BBC Radio 4\u2019s programme the UK\u2019s exit from the EU would be a long and uncertain process. It\u2019s very early days. What we did see from April to June was caution in front of the vote. What we saw after the vote in July was the UK perking up a bit. But that begs the question as to what the UK would have done in the absence of a Brexit vote or if the vote had gone the other way. We still worry. Business wants certainty. The government wants the best negotiating position with the EU and the two are actually in conflict. We would like a quick clean solution from a business point of view but the government needs a little bit of scope and time for negotiation. So there is going to be a considerable degree of uncertainty in the future. Sorrell said building trade agreements with both EU countries and non-EU countries was \u201ca very long-term task and it\u2019s going to take a lot longer I think that people anticipate.\u201d He added growth was going to be slow and difficult. With all that said, WPP reported better-than-expected first half results. Things were going so well the group said the outlook for the full year had improved, and it revised up its forecast for full-year revenue growth to \u201cwell over\u201d 3%, from an earlier forecast of \u201cover 3%\u201d. So Sorrell\u2019s main points seem to be that although there appears to have been little negative impact from Brexit so far, things could have been even better if the vote had gone the other way and things could get worse as the complexity of agreeing trade deals become apparent. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Official data has confirmed the German economy slowed in the second quarter, when GDP increased by 0.4%. It compared with growth of 0.7% in the first quarter. The annual growth rate for the second quarter was confirmed at 3.1%. Household and public sector spending, as well as exports, were drivers of growth in the second quarter. Investment however was a drag. Carsten Brzeski, ING\u2019s chief economist in Germany, comments on the outlook for Europe\u2019s largest economy: Private consumption should remain an important growth driver on the back of low inflation, low interest rates, low unemployment and higher wages. In addition, at least in the short run, the refugee crisis will continue to support domestic demand and the construction sector should rebound quickly after the technical correction on the second quarter. The economy\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel, however, remains the lack of new investment. To kick-start investment in an ageing economy, some government support is needed. Not only at the national level but also at the European level. Also today we will provide a preview of the 2016 Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers, which kicks off on Thursday. At 9.30am the British Bankers Association will publish mortgage figures for July, giving us some clues on the state of the UK housing market in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. Later in the US housing data will offer an insight into the market there, and what implications it might have for interest rates. We will bring you all the developments throughout the day.",

As you\u2019d expect, I pay for my personal expenses whilst away and only reclaim what is a business expense.</p> <p>My personal life is obviously a private matter as it is for anyone else. But I deeply regret being the cause of so much adverse publicity and the damage that has been done to the Group\u2019s reputation. It has detracted from the great work which you do for our customers on a daily basis and from the major accomplishments of the past five years. This includes the Government shareholding having reduced from over 40% to around 9% with over \u00a316 billion plus dividends having been returned to taxpayers.</p> <p>More broadly I have been a strong advocate of expecting the highest professional standards from everyone at the bank, and that includes me. I will continue to strive to meet those standards. Having the highest professional standards raises the bar against which we are judged and as I have always said we must recognise that mistakes will be made. I don\u2019t expect anyone to get everything right all the time. The important point being how we learn from those mistakes and the decisions and actions we take afterward.</p> <p>As we look forward, it is your hard work over the last five years returning the Group to financial health that means we are best placed among our peers to continue supporting the UK economy and to help Britain prosper. We chose to focus on helping the UK economy \u2013 in particular through our support for first time buyers, small businesses and UK corporates \u2013 and as a result by choice, our future is inextricably linked with the future success of the UK economy.</p> <p>The extended period of low interest rates that we now face has created uncertainties for the UK economy and new challenges for the Group.

BBC Radio 4\u2019s programme the UK\u2019s exit from the EU would be a long and uncertain process.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> It\u2019s very early days. What we did see from April to June was caution in front of the vote. What we saw after the vote in July was the UK perking up a bit. But that begs the question as to what the UK would have done in the absence of a Brexit vote or if the vote had gone the other way.</p> <p>We still worry. Business wants certainty. The government wants the best negotiating position with the EU and the two are actually in conflict. We would like a quick clean solution from a business point of view but the government needs a little bit of scope and time for negotiation. So there is going to be a considerable degree of uncertainty in the future.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sorrell said building trade agreements with both EU countries and non-EU countries was \u201ca very long-term task and it\u2019s going to take a lot longer I think that people anticipate.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added growth was going to be slow and difficult.</p> <p>With all that said, WPP reported better-than-expected first half results. Things were going so well the group said the outlook for the full year had improved, and it revised up its forecast for full-year revenue growth to \u201cwell over\u201d 3%, from an earlier forecast of \u201cover 3%\u201d.</p> <p>So Sorrell\u2019s main points seem to be that although there appears to have been little negative impact from Brexit so far, things could have been even better if the vote had gone the other way and things could get worse as the complexity of agreeing trade deals become apparent.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T07:51:33.287Z\">at 8.51am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57bd3ac1e4b0fe30498a4392\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-24T06:58:43.273Z\">7.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The agenda: German growth slows; Jackson Hole approaches</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>Official data has confirmed the <strong>German economy</strong> slowed in the second quarter, when GDP increased by 0.4%. </p> <p>It compared with growth of 0.7% in the first quarter.</p> <p>The annual growth rate for the second quarter was confirmed at 3.1%.</p> <p>Household and public sector spending, as well as exports, were drivers of growth in the second quarter.

A timetable for the event said non-shareholders are welcome to attend the Sports Direct AGM on 7 September, which is being held as usual at the company\u2019s headquarters in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. \u201cThe board would like to encourage all of those with questions about the company to attend ... so that we may be able to answer as many questions as possible,\u201d the retailer said in an announcement to the stock market. The 11am-5pm event will be hosted by all board directors, including the Sports Direct founder and executive deputy chairman, Mike Ashley, the chairman, Keith Hellawell, and the chief executive, Dave Forsey. Sports Direct had previously been unwilling to open up the meeting to outsiders. Last year, not for the first time, the retailer initially banned reporters before having a last-minute change of heart. Only a handful of shareholders usually attend the meeting, unlike the mass events hosted by the likes of Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco in London, and Morrisons in Bradford. This year, Sports Direct is offering a tour of the Shirebrook site, although it is not clear whether that includes the warehouse where the Guardian revealed that workers spent so long being searched by security that they were effectively being paid less than the minimum wage. After a lunch break, there will be a presentation by board directors and a Q&amp;A session, where topics up for discussion include the retailer\u2019s \u201cpeople strategy\u201d. The rare open day comes as Sports Direct faces increasing pressure from shareholders to improve corporate governance and its treatment of workers. Shareholders will vote on a union-backed plan to commission an investigation into working practices that will report back within six months. Last week, the company said it would publish an independent report on working practices put together by its lawyers, RPC. Sports Direct said the report would review an internal investigation announced in December after the Guardian\u2019s Shirebrook investigation. But some shareholder groups have said they do not regard RPC\u2019s report as independent and have threatened to vote against the re-election of board directors including Hellawell. Pressure on Sports Direct ramped up earlier this month, when it emerged that thousands of its warehouse workers would receive back pay totalling about \u00a31m after the retailer admitted breaking the law by not paying the national minimum wage. The company and its employment agencies are facing fines of up to \u00a32m imposed by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) after they were found to have been underpaying workers for four years.",

    "webTitle": "Are trains in Britain as overcrowded as Jeremy Corbyn claims?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s attempt to highlight overcrowding on the rail network by sitting down on a Virgin service from London to Newcastle has erupted into a political storm. The incident has raised a number of questions, including whether overcrowding is a genuine problem on Virgin services and whether the Labour leader\u2019s policy of nationalising train operators will make services less crowded and bring down fares. 1) How overcrowded are Virgin Trains services on a regular basis? Virgin Trains operates two franchises \u2013 the west coast and the east coast. Virgin has run the west coast, which includes trains from London to Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland since 1997. It took on the east coast \u2013 which runs trains from London to Newcastle, Leeds, York and Scotland \u2013 last year. Jeremy Corbyn was travelling on the east coast service from London King\u2019s Cross to Newcastle. This service is not listed by the Department for Transport as one of the 10 most overcrowded train services in Britain. In fact, passengers on Virgin Trains are more satisfied with the space on their train than most other services. The latest survey by passenger group Transport Focus found that 80% of passengers rated the Virgin Trains as \u201csatisfied or good\u201d in terms of the room for passengers to sit and stand between London and the north east of England. Out of 78 routes in Britain, only 14 scored higher, with five of those being Virgin Trains services too. Overall customer satisfaction on the route was rated as 86% by Transport Focus. However, the government\u2019s Office of Rail and Road found Virgin Trains has the highest number of complaints per 100,000 journeys in the UK. The main complaint was the train\u2019s facilities, which the ORR said was due to the franchise covering longer distances than other services. Virgin Trains has announced plans to launch a new fleet of 65 Virgin Azuma trains from 2018, which the company says will increase capacity into London on the east coast line by 28% at peak times. 2) How does overcrowding on Virgin services compare with the rest of the network and what are the most overcrowded routes in Britain? In contrast to Virgin Trains, just 47% of passengers on c2c\u2019s Tilbury line in Essex and TfL Rail in London rated the space to sit and stand as \u201csatisfied or good\u201d. Although the TfL Rail service is operated by MTR Corporation, a private company, it is controlled by a public authority - Transport for London. Figures from the Department for Transport show the 10 busiest train services are commuter services travelling through London or Manchester. Staggeringly, the two busiest services carry more than double than number of passengers they are supposed to. The busiest train in autumn 2015 was the 06.57 from Brighton to Bedford, which travels through London. At its busiest point at 08.20 at London Blackfriars, the Govia Thameslink service carries 960 standard class passengers, compared with a recommended load of 480. The second most crowded services in the 04.22 from Glasgow Central to Manchester Airport. When it reaches Manchester Airport at 08.22 it is carrying 410 passengers, compared with a recommended load of 191. 3) Will fare reform \u2013 such as the introduction of airline-style pricing \u2013 solve the problem and get Jeremy a seat? The introduction of airline-style seat pricing would result in the lifting of caps \u2013 limits on annual increases in prices \u2013 on certain fares such as off-peak return tickets on long distance journeys and anytime tickets around major cities. Season tickets are also capped, although allowing limitless increases on those would probably be politically untenable. So, would ramping up fares on popular off-peak services like the 11am from London to Newcastle ease overcrowding? In terms of discouraging all but urgent travel on that service, and diverting those who don\u2019t need to journey at that time on to different and cheaper services, then yes. But unless train operators pledge to make no more money from this new arrangement than they do currently, it leaves the door open to price gouging of, say, football fans or people who have to make urgent journeys for family reasons. Thus, higher profits for the likes of Virgin. This might pose political problems for the minister pushing this solution because the government sets rail fare policy. 4) Will nationalising the railways reduce overcrowding and make fares cheaper, as Corbyn claims? Dividends paid to private train operators like Virgin reached \u00a3222m last year. Reclaim those for the public purse and it is a small contribution to the annual running costs of the railways of \u00a313.6bn. So kicking private companies off the railways does not seem a long-term answer in terms of buying more trains \u2013 a big order for a single commuter route costs at least \u00a31bn \u2013 or subsidising fare expenditure, which saw commuters shell out \u00a38.8bn in 2014-15. The easiest way to reduce that fare expenditure is to look at the other side of the rail funding equation: the state. The taxpayer puts in around \u00a33.5bn a year and if that is to increase as a Labour policy, Corbyn will need to find the money from somewhere. 5) What are the other potential solutions to overcrowding and expensive fares? Reduce industry costs, which rose by 7%, or \u00a3900m, last year. The consequences of trying to pull that off are being played out on the Southern commuter route in London currently. Southern is introducing trains that don\u2019t need guards, which are cheaper to operate in the long run, and it has triggered a series of strikes. Better management of industrial relations is needed to pull off meaningful cost reductions. Secondly, costs need to fall at Network Rail, the state-owned company that operates the country\u2019s tracks and stations. It has debts of more than \u00a340bn and those need to be reduced. Cutting fare revenue would have to be balanced, potentially, by adding to that debt in order to make good the funding shortfall. 6) With the Southern dispute entering another month of strikes, are the railways in a bit of a mess? The railways are in a much better state than they were at the peak of the Railtrack debacle in 2000, which ultimately saw the government take back control of the nation\u2019s tracks and stations through the creation of Network Rail. Since that lowpoint, rail safety and punctuality has improved and passenger use has rocketed, You could argue that overcrowding is a consequence of success as more and more people use a reliable service. 7) Why did Virgin Trains go public with its footage of Corbyn? Corbyn\u2019s comments about overcrowding on Virgin Trains undoubtedly struck a raw nerve with Sir Richard Branson, who fiercely protects the reputation of his brands. Virgin Trains will soon be bidding to extend the west coast franchise, which ends in 2018, so will be anxious to correct any perceptions that its services are overcrowded and that customer satisfaction is falling. The Labour leader has described Branson as a \u201ctax exile\u201d and made it clear that he wants to nationalise the railways, meaning Branson had an extra incentive to respond to Corbyn rather than let his comments pass. A cynic may also suggest that traingate helped to take some of the spotlight away from British Airways bringing Great Britain\u2019s Olympic athletes back from Rio de Janeiro. BA is a bitter rival of Branson\u2019s airline Virgin Atlantic. It has taken Virgin Trains a week to respond to Corbyn\u2019s video. 8) How much has Virgin Trains benefited from privatisation? Virgin Rail Group, which operates the West Coast, is 51% owned by Branson\u2019s Virgin Group and 49% by transport group Stagecoach. Virgin Trains East Coast is 90% owned by Stagecoach and 10% by Virgin. In the last 10 years, Virgin Rail Group has paid out dividends to its shareholders worth \u00a3414.9m. This works out as \u00a3211.6m for Virgin and \u00a3203.3m for Stagecoach.",

      "bodyText": "Mortgage approvals at Britain\u2019s banks tumbled in July to their lowest level this year as people delayed making major financial decisions in the weeks after the Brexit vote. Banks approved 37,662 mortgages for house purchases last month, down from 39,763 in June and 19% lower than in July 2015, the British Bankers\u2019 Association said. But robust credit growth, especially higher credit card debt, added to signs that the decision to quit the European Union had little impact on consumers\u2019 appetite for smaller purchases. Net credit card lending rose in July by \u00a3291m \u2013 a 20% increase on the same month a year ago. The jump in short-term borrowing came after a similar \u00a3283m increase in June. Warnings that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU on 23 June could tip the economy into recession have so far been contradicted by surveys showing a more muted impact on the economy. Data from manufacturers, Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilder and UK supermarkets earlier this week pointed to the UK avoiding a recession in the second half of the year. Some economists have argued that while business and consumer confidence, which fell in July, was bolstered by the Bank of England cutting interest rates and increasing quantitive easing, a reluctance to make investment decision, including buying a home, could harm the economy in the coming months. Rebecca Harding, the BBA\u2019s chief economist, said the growing use of credit cards before and after the vote showed that short-term borrowing figures were keeping high street tills ringing, but gave little clue as to the mood of bank customers. \u201cConsumer credit has been growing considerably faster at an annualised rate of 6% than real earnings growth of 2.4% for some months now. This arguably underpinned the growth in retail sales that we saw in July and suggests, year-on-year growth in consumer credit appears reasonably correlated with year-on-year growth in retail sales,\u201d she said. \u201cThe housing market may be giving us a clearer picture of trends. Net mortgage lending continued to rise annually at 3% in July. This figure is identical to the annual increase in June. However, mortgage approvals for house purchases were 19% lower in July than a year earlier.\u201d Coupled with a 1% monthly increase in the value of loans, \u201cthe pressures in the housing market at the moment are actually quite weak\u201d, she added. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cWe suspect that the fundamentals for consumers will become less favourable over the coming months with purchasing power likely diminishing and the labour market softening.\u201d The BBA figures do not include lending by mutually owned building societies, which accounts for around a third of mortgages. Figures published on Tuesday by HM Revenue &amp; Customs showed almost as many homes were sold in July as in June, suggesting buyers were not spooked at the outcome of the Brexit vote.",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group has written to employees to apologise for revelations about his private life and the damage they caused the group\u2019s reputation. In an email sent to the bank\u2019s 75,000 staff, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio said he regretted the bad publicity caused by allegations of an affair with Wendy Piatt, a former aide to Tony Blair. The couple were pictured together while the married bank chief was on a business trip to Singapore. Horta-Os\u00f3rio, whose pay deals over the past two years total \u00a320m, also sought to quash talk of him leaving the group, saying he was as committed as ever to leading Britain\u2019s biggest retail bank. The reports earlier this month prompted questions about whether Horta-Os\u00f3rio breached Lloyds\u2019 policies by combining private and business expenses. Lloyds said on 10 August he had no case to answer after an internal review. In his email to staff, Horta-Os\u00f3rio reiterated that he kept personal and business expenses separate. But he admitted that the furore had damaged the bank, which is 9% owned by taxpayers after being bailed out during the financial crisis. He wrote: \u201cMy personal life is obviously a private matter as it is for anyone else. But I deeply regret being the cause of so much adverse publicity and the damage that has been done to the group\u2019s reputation. It has detracted from the great work which you do for our customers on a daily basis and from the major accomplishments of the past five years.\u201d Horta-Os\u00f3rio has stressed the importance of maintaining high standards of behaviour to Lloyds staff, which has paid multiple fines and billions of pounds in customer compensation for past misdeeds. He said he included himself in his call for good behaviour and promised to do better. He added: \u201cHaving the highest professional standards raises the bar against which we are judged and as I have always said we must recognise that mistakes will be made. I don\u2019t expect anyone to get everything right all the time. The important point being how we learn from those mistakes and the decisions and actions we take afterward.\u201d The revelations about Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s private life came soon after Lloyds announced plans to cut a further 3,000 jobs. This is on top of the 54,000 job losses announced since the bank rescued HBOS during the financial crisis. The Portuguese banker, who joined in 2011 from Santander, got a 6% salary increase to \u00a31.12m this year, while staff received 2%. Horta-Os\u00f3rio told staff their hard work was behind the bank\u2019s recovery and its ability to cope with low interest rates and a weakening economy. \u201cWith that in mind please be assured that I am as committed as ever to leading the group forward to deliver our strategy and to meet our future ambitions.

    "webTitle": "FTSE falters as Glencore leads mining shares lower", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mining shares are leading the market lower, with Glencore under pressure after a sharp drop in first half profits. The company reported a 13% drop in underlying profits to $4bn, but said its disposal programme was on track. Like other commodity companies, Glencore has suffered from a upheaval in the market amid concerns about global growth, not least in China, a key customer for mining groups. But Glencore cut its forecast for year end debt from the $17bn-\u00a318bn it expected in March to $16.5bn-$17.5bn. Chief executive Ivan Glasenberg said: We have already largely achieved our asset disposals target of $4bn-$5bn with a diverse and material pool of asset sales\u2019 processes also ongoing.. After a difficult start to the year, the more constructive tone of markets in recent months has helped support the pricing of many of our key commodities. While we are highly cash generative at current spot prices, we remain mindful that underlying markets continue to be volatile. Along with the results, Glencore also announced an agreement to sell a 30% stake plus all of the gold output from its Ernest Henry copper mine in Australia to Evolution Mining for $670m. The company\u2019s shares have fallen 4% to 181.7pafter the profit decline, as investors took profits following a doubling of the price in the past year. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said: Despite the 66% drop in net profit, Glencore\u2019s results - including the potential resumption of dividends next year, alongside a more aggressive debt reduction target, are a step in the right direction. However, with Glencore\u2019s share price having more than doubled year to date, after slumping 70% last year, we are seeing some profit taking in early trade. Analysts at Liberum issued a sell note, but Canaccord remained a buyer and Investec said: At first pass a reasonable result, although concensus numbers suggest that some of the market will have expected better. Other miners were dragged back with Glencore. Anglo American is down 27.3p at 848.8p while Rio Tinto is down 51.5p at 2398.5p and Fresnillo has fallen 49p to \u00a317.87. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 21.49 points at 6847.02, as investors remain cautious ahead of this week\u2019s central bank meeting in Jackson Hole in the US. But housebuilders continue to gain ground after this week\u2019s results from Persimmon, up 48p at \u00a319.18. Meanwhile advertising group WPP has jumped 102p to \u00a318.49 following its latest update. Among the mid-caps, Onesavings has jumped more than 9% to 259.9p as the group, which offers residential mortgages and buy-to-let loans reported a 36% increase in first half profits to \u00a364.6m.",

Like other commodity companies, Glencore has suffered from a upheaval in the market amid concerns about global growth, not least in China, a key customer for mining groups.</p> <p>But Glencore cut its forecast for year end debt from the $17bn-\u00a318bn it expected in March to $16.5bn-$17.5bn. Chief executive Ivan Glasenberg said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have already largely achieved our asset disposals target of $4bn-$5bn with a diverse and material pool of asset sales\u2019 processes also ongoing..</p> <p>After a difficult start to the year, the more constructive tone of markets in recent months has helped support the pricing of many of our key commodities. While we are highly cash generative at current spot prices, we remain mindful that underlying markets continue to be volatile.</p> </blockquote> <p>Along with the results, Glencore also announced an agreement to sell a 30% stake plus all of the gold output from its Ernest Henry copper mine in Australia to Evolution Mining for $670m.</p> <p>The company\u2019s shares have fallen 4% to 181.7pafter the profit decline, as investors took profits following a doubling of the price in the past year. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the 66% drop in net profit, Glencore\u2019s results - including the potential resumption of dividends next year, alongside a more aggressive debt reduction target, are a step in the right direction. However, with Glencore\u2019s share price having more than doubled year to date, after slumping 70% last year, we are seeing some profit taking in early trade.</p> </blockquote> <p>Analysts at Liberum issued a sell note, but Canaccord remained a buyer and Investec said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At first pass a reasonable result, although concensus numbers suggest that some of the market will have expected better.</p> </blockquote> <p>Other miners were dragged back with Glencore. <strong>Anglo American</strong> is down 27.3p at 848.8p while<strong> Rio Tinto</strong> is down 51.5p at 2398.5p and <strong>Fresnillo</strong> has fallen 49p to \u00a317.87.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is down 21.49 points at 6847.02, as investors remain cautious ahead of this week\u2019s central bank meeting in Jackson Hole in the US.</p> <p>But housebuilders continue to gain ground after <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/23/persimmon-shares-rise-housebuilder-shrugs-off-brexit-vote\">this week\u2019s results</a></strong> from <strong>Persimmon</strong>, up 48p at \u00a319.18. </p> <p>Meanwhile advertising group <strong>WPP </strong>has jumped 102p to \u00a318.49 following <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/aug/24/wpp-profits-uk-growth-brexit-sir-martin-sorrell-advertisers\">its latest update.</a></strong></p> <p>Among the mid-caps, <strong>Onesavings</strong> has jumped more than 9% to 259.9p as the group, which offers residential mortgages and buy-to-let loans reported a 36% increase in first half profits to \u00a364.6m.</p>",

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca has agreed to sell its antibiotics division to Pfizer, the US drugs company that failed in its bid to buy the group in a takeover battle two years ago. In a deal that could be worth more than $1.5bn (\u00a31.1bn), the British pharmaceutical group said it would sell its late-stage small molecule antibiotics business in most markets outside the US to Pfizer. Pfizer will make an upfront $550m payment when the deal is completed towards the end of this year and a further $175m in January 2019. The US company will also pay up to $250m when certain milestones are reached and as much as $600m in sales-related payments, plus royalties on certain drugs. AstraZeneca repelled an unwanted \u00a369bn takeover approach from Pfizer in May 2014. This was due to opposition from UK politicians and scientists who said the deal would undermine Britain\u2019s standing as a centre for research. Pfizer has since been on an acquisition spree and tried to buy Botox maker Allergan to create the world\u2019s biggest drugmaker, but the US government quashed the deal. AstraZeneca said it was selling the antibiotics business to concentrate on respiratory and autoimmunity, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and oncology. It said Pfizer, whose most famous drug is Viagra, has a large anti-infectious disease division, giving it greater commercial strength to develop and sell the drugs. Luke Miels, the head of AstraZeneca\u2019s antibiotics business unit, said: \u201cThis agreement reinforces our strategic focus to invest in our three main therapy areas where we can make the greatest difference to patients\u2019 lives. Our strong science in antibiotics will continue to serve a critical public health need through Pfizer\u2019s dedicated focus on infectious diseases.\u201d Pfizer will acquire the rights to develop and sell drugs such as Merrem/Meronem, which treats pneumonia and other diseases in hospital patients, and ATM-AVI, which is under development to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Governments are trying to encourage drug companies to come up with new antibiotics as infections become resistant to treatment. Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, has said the threatened loss of antibiotics is on a par with terrorism and climate change.",
