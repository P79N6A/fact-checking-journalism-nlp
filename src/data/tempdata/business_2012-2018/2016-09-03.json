      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley and the board of Sports Direct face a showdown with shareholders this week over a host of problems \u2013 including treatment of its employees, corporate governance and ailing performance. Investors in the controversial firm, which has faced months of pressure over working conditions for staff, get their chance to quiz directors at Sports Direct\u2019s annual meeting in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, on Wednesday. Ashley, who founded the company and still owns 55%, is the executive deputy chairman and will attend but in the past he has stayed quiet, leaving the difficult job of answering questions to chairman Keith Hellawell and chief executive Dave Forsey. Thousands of Sports Direct warehouse workers are to receive back pay totalling about \u00a31m after the retailer admitted breaking the law by not paying the national minimum wage. And the company and its employment agencies are facing fines of up to \u00a32m imposed by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) after they were found to have been underpaying workers for four years. So, after a tumultuous year for the retailer, these are the questions that investors should ask at the AGM. What improvements have been made to working conditions in the main warehouse in Shirebrook? MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee claimed that Ashley was running Sports Direct like a \u201cVictorian workhouse\u201d. Ashley himself told the parliamentary committee in June that an internal review of Sports Direct\u2019s working practices uncovered \u201cunpleasant surprises\u201d. Shareholders need to clarify what improvements have been made since then, other than Sports Direct increasing pay for staff and agreeing to pay warehouse workers back pay after a Guardian investigation exposed that it was effectively not paying the national minimum wage. RPC, the law firm, will this week publish its report on Ashley\u2019s review of working conditions, but leading shareholders believe this is not independent because RPC is a regular adviser to Sports Direct. The company should provide indisputable evidence about the changes it has made. What\u2019s the status of the HM Revenue &amp; Customs inquiry into Sports Direct? Even though Sports Direct has reached an agreement with HMRC and trade unions about back pay for staff in the Shirebrook warehouse, HMRC is still understood to be investigating the retailer about whether workers in its warehouse and shops were paid less than the national minimum wage. The threat of a multimillion pound fine hangs over the company. Will Keith Hellawell resign as chairman if a majority of independent shareholders fail to support him? Sports Direct is facing a major rebellion at its annual meeting, with institutional directors threatening to vote against the re-election of former policeman Keith Hellawell as chairman. If a majority of independent shareholders vote against him, Ashley could use his 55% stake to protect Hellawell at a second vote. However, surely Hellawell\u2019s position will be untenable if there is a major rebellion. The chairman is supposed to represent all shareholders and keep a company\u2019s management in check. Who is conducting the review of the company\u2019s board and do you pledge to publish and implement its findings? Sports Direct announced last month that an \u201cexternal evaluation\u201d of its board will take place later this year. It is a minimum requirement of any FTSE company to conduct a review every three years but, given the concerns about the dominance of Ashley on the Sports Direct board, the suitability of Hellawell as chairman, and the lack of a permanent finance director, investors should push for information on who will conduct this evaluation and ensure that its recommendations are implemented. When will you appoint a permanent finance director? Sports Direct has not had a permanent finance director since December 2013, when Bob Mellors stepped down for health reasons. Matt Pearson is filling the role on an interim basis, but it is unprecedented for a listed company to go so long without a permanent finance director. Major shareholders believe this is another sign of the slack corporate governance at Sports Direct and the power that Ashley wields over the business. Why is the delivery of online orders overseas being managed from a house in Cleethorpes? The latest controversy to engulf Sports Direct was the news that it pays an obscure company, owned by Mike Ashley\u2019s brother, to deliver online orders outside the UK. Barlin Delivery Limited is owned by John Ashley and registered to a detached house in Lincolnshire. It makes a profit of \u00a3300,000 a year from the arrangement with Sports Direct, although it is not clear if this is after salaries and dividends, and uses DHL to actually deliver goods. Sports Direct needs to explain why this arrangement with John Ashley is the most efficient way to manage orders, how much has been paid to Barlin, and why this was not disclosed as a related-party transaction in its accounts. How would you describe your relationship with suppliers, particularly Adidas? Amid the controversy about working practices and corporate governance, Sports Direct is also finding trading tough in Britain and Europe. One of the reasons for this is that major suppliers are not providing the company with their most popular products, choosing to go through their own shops or Sports Direct\u2019s rival, JD, instead. For example, Adidas does not provide Sports Direct with its replica football kits, including Manchester United\u2019s, nor its latest trainers. Are you finding it more difficult to attract and keep staff? Staff turnover at Sports Direct rose by more than three percentage points last year to 22%, according to its annual report. The figure is almost three times the average turnover rate of 8% for UK employers, but is lower than other retailers. Two concerns spring out from with this statistic \u2013 is Sports Direct losing its most talented shop workers and warehouse staff as a result of poor working conditions, and is the company struggling to attract new talent? This could explain why the retailer has not replaced Hellawell or hired a permanent finance director. Is Mike Ashley still committed to Sports Direct? Sports Direct stated in its annual results that Ashley had told the board he had no plans to buy the shares in the company that he does not hold and take it private. However, the annual meeting is a chance for the man himself to outline his plans in person. Sports Direct shares are trading at around 325p, way down on their 2014 peak of 922p and only just above the 300p the firm floated at in 2007. Ashley could well be tempted to take the company off the stock market, which would end the criticism from City institutions and other shareholders. Alternatively, he could sell more of his shares, even reducing his holding below 50%. After all, Ashley told MPs that Sports Direct may have become too big for him and the tycoon has stepped back from day-to-day control of Newcastle United, the football club he owns. OPEN DAY AT HEADQUARTERS Sports Direct is opening its doors to members of the public on the day of the annual meeting. Usually only shareholders, and occasionally journalists, are invited to attend annual meetings, but Sports Direct says it wants to enable the board, including Mike Ashley, to \u201cengage with as many people as possible in an open discussion about the business\u201d. The invitation will allow critics of the company, such as MPs and trade unions, to attend. The day will begin at 11am at the annual meeting, before there is a tour of Sports Direct\u2019s headquarters in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, a presentation, and a question-and-answer session. However, guests and questions had to be pre-registered, so it remains to be seen whether Sports Direct is prepared to tackle difficult questions from its most ardent critics.",

      "bodyText": "Three years ago, Apple boss Tim Cook was emphatic. Appearing before a US senate committee, the man who runs the world\u2019s largest company told the politicians straight: Apple had no intention of repatriating billions of dollars of profits from its international operations until the US Treasury slashed corporate taxation. \u201cI have no current plan to bring them back at the current tax rate,\u201d Cook said. It was a response \u2013 one of many \u2013 that rankled with the committee\u2019s chair, Carl Levin. Leaning forward, the tough septuagenarian senator from Michigan glared at Cook over the top of his glasses: \u201cIt is not your intent to bring them home unless we reduce our tax rates? Is that correct?\u201d Cook repeated: \u201cI have no current plan to do so at the current tax rates.\u201d It was a charged exchange that laid bare the impasse between corporate America and Washington. At that time, Apple had amassed about $100bn in cash \u2013 income from its foreign operations \u2013 all of which was being carefully held outside America, beyond the reach of the US tax authorities. Since then, every three months, Apple has given Wall Street an update on the size of this cash pile, and each time the figure has grown by several billion. At last count, six weeks ago, the figure stood at $215bn (\u00a3162bn). If Apple were to bring that money back to the US, however, it would be taxed at about 40%, one of the highest tax rates in the world. \u201cApple serves its shareholders by keeping these funds overseas,\u201d the Californian technology firm told the senators. By using a long-standing loophole in the tax code, Apple, in common with many other multinationals, can continually defer US taxes on these offshore earnings for as long as they are kept outside America. This is a quirk of US law that has had a dramatic, and increasingly unsustainable, impact on the corporate world. It has meant that many of the richest firms in the US are amassing huge, untaxed offshore cash piles. In recent, years that trend has been accelerated by America\u2019s booming leading tech firms and their worldwide success. According to ratings agency Moody\u2019s, US companies, excluding banks, had an estimated $1.2 trillion in cash overseas at the end of last year. Just over half of that sum \u2013 $630bn \u2013 is estimated to be held by Apple and other tech companies, among them Silicon Valley firms Microsoft ($96bn), Cisco ($57bn), Google ($43bn) and Oracle ($45bn). Barack Obama promised he would get corporate America to bring profits home, as have both the Republican and Democrat candidates vying to succeed him. Quite how to do so, however, has divided Washington for decades. And if the result has been intransigence, few have complained very loudly. The impasse has suited corporate America well, allowing its biggest international businesses to enjoy years of ultra-low tax bills. Last week, however, the dramatic intervention of Europe\u2019s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager appeared to steal the reform initiative from Washington. In a decision that for many years tax experts would have thought unthinkable, she ruled that a significant slice of Apple\u2019s offshore wealth had been illegally won. The iPhone maker, Vestager found, had been benefiting from a sweetheart tax deal agreed behind closed doors with Ireland a quarter of a century ago. That deal had resulted in Apple avoiding \u20ac13bn in taxes over 10 years, she said: those back taxes, plus interest, would have to be repaid. Cook was furious. He insisted that the income had already been taxed in Europe. \u201cThe commission is now calling to retroactively change those rules,\u201d he protested last Tuesday. Two days later he was still raging \u2014 calling Vestager\u2019s decision \u201cinvalid\u201d and \u201ccrap\u201d \u2014 but he also had a surprise announcement. During an interview on Irish radio, he started talking about repatriating cash held overseas and paying US tax. \u201cRight now, I would forecast that we repatriate next year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe [have] provisioned several billion for the US for payment [of tax bills] as soon as we repatriate.\u201d There has been no further elaboration, but it is a marked change in tone from Cook, who now needs all the support he can muster from allies on Capitol Hill. Hints that Apple might be more willing to pay tax in America might be just the kind of message US politicians wanted to hear. The Apple boss certainly has friends in high places. Recent months have seen him host fundraising events for both Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton and Republican house speaker Paul Ryan. For all that, however, few US politicians have come out fighting hard to defend Apple\u2019s Irish tax arrangements. There have some generalised warnings from US Treasury secretary Jack Lew that the commission\u2019s move could have a \u201cchilling effect on US-EU cross-border investment\u201d and that Washington would have to \u201cconsider potential responses\u201d. But as global leaders gather in Hangzhou, China, on Sunday for the latest G20 summit, there are little signs of Apple\u2019s \u20ac13bn back-taxes penalty causing a full-blown crisis. Behind the scenes, dissatisfaction over corporate America and its untaxed offshore cash is growing. Politicians may not yet have figured out what they intend to do about this issue, but the last 18 months have provided a few stark reminders that there is a lot at stake. Last November, many in Washington were surprised to see Pfizer, one of America\u2019s largest drug makers, unveiling plans for a record-breaking $160bn deal \u2013 a so-called \u201ctax inversion\u201d transaction which would see it merge with a smaller, foreign rival and shift its headquarters outside the US. The Pfizer bid was just the latest, and largest, in a wave of such inversion deals. Such transactions are designed to allow multinationals greater freedom to use their swollen cash reserves without triggering US tax bills. In the end, however, the Obama administration moved quickly enough to introduce tougher rules to discourage inversion deals, thwarting Pfizer\u2019s plans. But it was yet another wake-up call: corporate America\u2019s untaxed offshore cash pile was a problem that needed fixing. Most tax reform experts concede Apple\u2019s Irish tax arrangements are hard to defend as fair. Pascal Saint-Amans, head of tax at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), who last year secured unprecedented agreement on reforms to tackle tax avoidance, is among the critics. \u201cThe Apple case is a great illustration of the most aggressive tax planning that is out there\u2026 [It produced] massive profits that ended up going taxed nowhere. It is precisely because of these types of schemes that the G20 asked us to start looking at major tax reforms [three years ago].\u201d It is the OECD\u2019s work on tax reform that prompted Ireland to finally close loopholes that allowed Apple and other multinationals to use \u201cnon-tax-resident\u201d Irish companies to receive billions of dollars in income that then went untaxed. As a result, Apple unwound its use of such arrangements last year. It now remains to be seen whether Vestager demonstrates an appetite for going after further large sums from cash-rich US corporations that have used aggressive tax structures in Europe. She already has two suspected sweetheart deals in her sights \u2014 separate tax rulings granted by Luxembourg to McDonald\u2019s and Amazon. And she has not ruled out adding more. Whatever the outcome, however, Washington and Wall Street have woken up to the possibility that if America is unwilling to tax the ballooning offshore cash mountains of its leading companies, others are now emboldened to do so.",

Appearing before <a href=\"http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/offshore-profit-shifting-and-the-us-tax-code_-part-2\">a US senate committee</a>, the man who runs the world\u2019s largest company told the politicians straight: Apple had no intention of repatriating billions of dollars of profits from its international operations until the US Treasury slashed corporate taxation.</p> <p>\u201cI have no current plan to bring them back at the current tax rate,\u201d Cook said.</p> <p>It was a response \u2013 one of many \u2013 that rankled with the committee\u2019s chair, Carl Levin. Leaning forward, the tough septuagenarian senator from Michigan glared at Cook over the top of his glasses: \u201cIt is not your intent to bring them home unless we reduce our tax rates? Is that correct?\u201d</p> <p>Cook repeated: \u201cI have no current plan to do so at the current tax rates.\u201d</p> <p>It was a charged exchange that laid bare the impasse between corporate America and Washington. At that time, Apple had amassed about $100bn in cash \u2013 income from its foreign operations \u2013 all of which was being carefully held outside America, beyond the reach of the US tax authorities.</p> <p>Since then, every three months, Apple has given Wall Street an update on the size of this cash pile, and each time the figure has grown by several billion. At last count, six weeks ago, the figure stood at $215bn (\u00a3162bn).</p> <p>If Apple were to bring that money back to the US, however, it would be taxed at about 40%, one of the highest tax rates in the world. \u201cApple serves its shareholders by keeping these funds overseas,\u201d the Californian technology firm told the senators.</p> <p>By using a long-standing loophole in the tax code, Apple, in common with many other multinationals, can continually defer US taxes on these offshore earnings for as long as they are kept outside America.</p> <p>This is a quirk of US law that has had a dramatic, and increasingly unsustainable, impact on the corporate world. It has meant that many of the richest firms in the US are amassing huge, untaxed offshore cash piles. In recent, years that trend has been accelerated by America\u2019s booming leading tech firms and their worldwide success.</p> <p>According to ratings agency Moody\u2019s, US companies, excluding banks, had an estimated $1.2 trillion in cash overseas at the end of last year. Just over half of that sum \u2013 $630bn \u2013 is estimated to be held by Apple and other tech companies, among them Silicon Valley firms Microsoft ($96bn), Cisco ($57bn), Google ($43bn) and Oracle ($45bn).</p> <p>Barack Obama promised he would get corporate America to bring profits home, as have both the Republican and Democrat candidates vying to succeed him. Quite how to do so, however, has divided Washington for decades.</p> <p>And if the result has been intransigence, few have complained very loudly. The impasse has suited corporate America well, allowing its biggest international businesses to enjoy years of ultra-low tax bills.</p> <p>Last week, however, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/30/apple-pay-back-taxes-eu-ruling-ireland-state-aid\">dramatic intervention of Europe\u2019s competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager </a>appeared to steal the reform initiative from Washington.</p> <p>In a decision that for many years tax experts would have thought unthinkable, she ruled that a significant slice of Apple\u2019s offshore wealth had been illegally won. The iPhone maker, Vestager found, had been benefiting from a sweetheart tax deal agreed behind closed doors with Ireland a quarter of a century ago. That deal had resulted in Apple avoiding \u20ac13bn in taxes over 10 years, she said: those back taxes, plus interest, would have to be repaid.</p> <p>Cook was furious. He insisted that the income had already been taxed in Europe. \u201cThe commission is now calling to retroactively change those rules,\u201d he protested last Tuesday. Two days later he was still raging \u2014 calling Vestager\u2019s decision \u201cinvalid\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/political-crap-tim-cook-apple-tax-ruling\">crap</a>\u201d \u2014 but he also had a surprise announcement. During an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/apple-boss-tim-cook-repatriate-billions-to-us-treasury-next-year\">interview on Irish radio,</a> he started talking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/01/apple-boss-tim-cook-repatriate-billions-to-us-treasury-next-year\">repatriating cash held overseas </a>and paying US tax. \u201cRight now, I would forecast that we repatriate next year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe [have] provisioned several billion for the US for payment [of tax bills] as soon as we repatriate.\u201d</p> <p>There has been no further elaboration, but it is a marked change in tone from Cook, who now needs all the support he can muster from allies on Capitol Hill. Hints that Apple might be more willing to pay tax in America might be just the kind of message US politicians wanted to hear.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a0fc93f0c5b0cb05a2bd00d6410781ae8444c12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a0fc93f0c5b0cb05a2bd00d6410781ae8444c12/0_61_3884_2331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margrethe Vestager\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margrethe Vestager: demanding \u20ac13bn in back taxes from Apple in Ireland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Apple boss certainly has friends in high places. Recent months have seen him host fundraising events for both Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton and Republican house speaker Paul Ryan.</p> <p>For all that, however, few US politicians have come out fighting hard to defend Apple\u2019s Irish tax arrangements. There have some generalised warnings from US Treasury secretary Jack Lew that the commission\u2019s move could have a \u201cchilling effect on US-EU cross-border investment\u201d and that Washington would have to \u201cconsider potential responses\u201d.</p> <p>But as global leaders gather in Hangzhou, China, on Sunday for the latest G20 summit, there are little signs of Apple\u2019s \u20ac13bn back-taxes penalty causing a full-blown crisis.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, dissatisfaction over corporate America and its untaxed offshore cash is growing. Politicians may not yet have figured out what they intend to do about this issue, but the last 18 months have provided a few stark reminders that there is a lot at stake.</p> <p>Last November, many in Washington were surprised to see Pfizer, one of America\u2019s largest drug makers, unveiling plans for a record-breaking $160bn deal \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/06/pfizer-allergan-tax-inversion-deal-merger\">so-called \u201ctax inversion\u201d</a> transaction which would see it merge with a smaller, foreign rival and shift its headquarters outside the US.</p> <p>The Pfizer bid was just the latest, and largest, in a wave of such inversion deals. Such transactions are designed to allow multinationals greater freedom to use their swollen cash reserves without triggering US tax bills.</p> <p>In the end, however, the Obama administration moved quickly enough to introduce tougher rules to discourage inversion deals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/05/pfizer-allergan-merger-tax-avoidance-rules\">thwarting Pfizer\u2019s plans</a>. But it was yet another wake-up call: corporate America\u2019s untaxed offshore cash pile was a problem that needed fixing.</p> <p>Most tax reform experts concede Apple\u2019s Irish tax arrangements are hard to defend as fair. Pascal Saint-Amans, head of tax at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), who last year secured unprecedented agreement on reforms to tackle tax avoidance, is among the critics.</p> <p>\u201cThe Apple case is a great illustration of the most aggressive tax planning that is out there\u2026 [It produced] massive profits that ended up going taxed nowhere. It is precisely because of these types of schemes that the G20 asked us to start looking at major tax reforms [three years ago].\u201d</p> <p>It is the OECD\u2019s work on tax reform that prompted Ireland to finally close loopholes that allowed Apple and other multinationals to use \u201cnon-tax-resident\u201d Irish companies to receive billions of dollars in income that then went untaxed. As a result, Apple unwound its use of such arrangements last year.</p> <p>It now remains to be seen whether Vestager demonstrates an appetite for going after further large sums from cash-rich US corporations that have used aggressive tax structures in Europe. She already has two suspected sweetheart deals in her sights \u2014 separate tax rulings granted by Luxembourg to McDonald\u2019s and Amazon. And she has not ruled out adding more.</p> <p>Whatever the outcome, however, Washington and Wall Street have woken up to the possibility that if America is unwilling to tax the ballooning offshore cash mountains of its leading companies, others are now emboldened to do so.</p>",
