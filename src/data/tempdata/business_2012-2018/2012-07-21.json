      "bodyText": "G4S is dead. Long live G4S? In the minds of the public, politicians and media, the world's biggest security company is fatally damaged after completely mangling its eight-week contract to provide security for the London Olympics. But away from the fury, analysts who have watched G4S for years are far from convinced that the company, which can trace its roots in Britain back to four bicycle-riding guards in 1935 dressed in old police uniforms, will suffer in the long term. They believe the business will continue to thrive \u2013 thanks to the short memories of ministers and officials, stricter laws about security guards that should make outsourcing more attractive, and the UK's irrelevance when billions can be made elsewhere. Before the Olympics catastrophe, G4S had already announced that it saw a future away from the UK and the apparent cash cow of Whitehall contracts, stating that it planned to earn half its worldwide revenues from emerging markets in Africa and Asia. Even today, the company already makes more money from developing countries (\u00a31.84bn in 2011) than it does from the UK (\u00a31.25bn), while it holds more government contracts in the US than it does in Britain. Caroline de La Soujeole, an analyst at Seymour Pierce, explains: \"The UK security market is one of the most mature in the world; emerging markets are far more important to G4S and that's where a big chunk of their growth will come from.\" Even chief executive Nick Buckles admitted the Olympics contract was barely profitable when he was grilled by the home affairs select committee last week. He said: \"We did this purely because we wanted to have a successful security operation at the Olympics. It is not particularly financially lucrative for us. It was much more about, ironically, reputation and building reputation for the future.\" And for all his explicit contrition, Buckles probably knows the company will continue to profit from the UK government, which paid G4S \u00a3759m last year for contracts including electronic tagging of criminals, processing Department for Work and Pensions benefits claimants and running Lincolnshire police's back-office operations. Analysts agree. Exane BNP Paribas says: \"The Olympics have turned into a debacle for G4S [but] the London problems should not severely jeopardise the group's long-term growth prospects.\" And David Brockton and Guy Hewett at Execution Noble say: \"Poor operational management or over-ambition ultimately lies behind this particular contract failure, but we do not believe it is symptomatic of a deeper problem.\" Indeed, this is not the first time G4S has suffered humiliation while carrying out a public sector contract. In the early 1990s, just three weeks into taking over the running of prisoner transfers to and from court, Group 4, as the company then was, lost seven inmates. The thrusting Labour home affairs spokesman at the time, Tony Blair, called for the \"comedy of errors\" to come to an end, saying: \"It is time for the home secretary to get a grip of the prison escort service and ensure public safety. If he cannot be satisfied that Group 4 are providing a service in an effective way, he must take steps for the contract to be withdrawn.\" But within 10 years G4S, created in 2004 from the merged Scandinavian company Group 4 Falck and the UK's Securicor, had been given some of the biggest government contracts ever by Blair \u2013 despite other high-profile failures, such as the Yarl's Wood detention centre fire in 2002, which caused huge damage after Group 4 security guards lost control. It is also not the first time Buckles has earned the wrath of his shareholders, having been forced to humiliatingly end a \u00a35.2bn takeover of Danish contract cleaning firm ISS last year. A \u00a32bn rights issue was required, something shareholders were unhappy with, leading to the board pulling the deal \u2013 but not before spending millions on advisers' fees. Shareholders were arguably more frustrated with the ISS failure than the Olympics fiasco; the former led to angry scenes at the company's annual meeting last month. After the meeting, which journalists were banned from attending, it was claimed some shouted \"you've wasted \u00a350m\" \u2013 a similar amount to that lost from the Olympics contract. And while G4S might struggle in the short term to get UK government contracts, a little-known piece of legislation could provide an additional boost to its revenues in the private sector. Currently, any employer that needs security staff \u2013 a doorman, say, or a CCTV operator \u2013 does not need accreditation from the Security Industry Authority (SIA) for having such employees. However, after lobbying by major security firms, the government is set to change the law, making it mandatory for any company whose business involves a security aspect to get an expensive SIA licence from the Home Office. Paul Russell, a security consultant, explains that small businesses with minimal security operations will turn to outsourcing firms like G4S because of the potentially huge cost of applying for a company licence. He says: \"When it becomes mandatory for companies to have SIA licences for their in-house security officers, there will be a rush to outsource the work.\" He also believes that as more businesses and governments turn to outsourcing across whole areas of their organisations, G4S will naturally expand. \"Clients want an easy time, so they think: 'We'll give this contract to the biggest company because they must know what they're doing'. \"Companies like G4S are now also expanding and offering a one-stop shop security facilities service, which smaller security firms simply cannot match.\" Therefore, assuming there are no major security breaches during the Olympics, G4S could confidently call this nothing more than a minor blip, resulting in a bruised UK reputation and the hasty scrapping of its new \"Proudly protecting the London Olympics\" letterhead. That's because the company could quite easily continue to make billions outside the UK by filling cash machines in India or offering personal security in Sierra Leone. And despite all the bluster from parliament, none of G4S's government contracts, either current or in the pipeline, have yet been cancelled. A 10-year stint running Lincolnshire police's backroom operations could even see the \"suspension\" of outsourcing plans by other forces lifted, something that would make Buckles \u2013 the son of an Essex policeman \u2013 very pleased. The 52-year-old knows he has an uphill battle to restore the company's reputation, and may yet lose his job, but it seems he considers the Olympics disaster as nothing more than a vanity project gone wrong. And, on current evidence, the City seems to agree with him.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "High-street banks have long promised to go the extra mile for their customers, but none of them can purport to offer the kind of service private banks do. Coutts recalls a story when a client dropped his wallet over the side of his yacht. One satellite-phone call later and the bank couriered out cards and cash to the next port he was going to. Then there was the diabetic client who got straight off an aircraft and into back-to-back meetings. When he finally checked into his hotel, there was nothing on the menu he could eat, so he called his bank \u2013 obviously \u2013 which duly sent a taxi there, complete with restaurant recommendations. Private banks even send their clients' children on boot camps for offspring of the ultra-rich. AH Loder Advisers has an annual dog sled expedition across the Arctic. While billed as leadership training, these trips are as much about ensuring the children stay with the bank when they inherit. But such service does not come cheap. Individuals have to have around \u00a31m in investable assets before private banks will even deign to speak to them, though Coutts says this is flexible and it will \"invest time to develop a client's potential, whether they be a lawyer or an entrepreneur\". Beyond these perks, private banks emphasise personal service. Where a retail bank will take a cursory glance at your credit rating, a private banker will ask about a client's family history and their \"objectives for their wealth\". Instead of a Mumbai call centre, customers will have the mobile number of their private banker, whom they can call at any hour of the day. It's hardly surprising; safeguarding the assets of so-called \"high net worth individuals\", who are often willing to pay a premium for secrecy, is highly lucrative. According to Tax Justice Network research, the top 10 private banks \u2013 led by UBS and Credit Suisse \u2013 had more than $6 trillion under management in 2010, up from $2.3tn five years earlier. Much of the appeal lies in their discretion. Switzerland has long been at the heart of the private banking industry, with its tradition of secrecy dating back to 1934, when it became a criminal offence for employees to pass on information about clients' accounts to a third party, even government tax inspectors from other countries. For years, governments turned a blind eye to their wealthiest citizens squirrelling away their riches in such tax havens. But since the global economic meltdown, cash-strapped governments are scrabbling around for revenue, and Switzerland has been one of the first places they have looked. The UK government has struck a deal with the Swiss authorities to try and claw back at least some money from tax evaders. Under this deal, UK residents with undeclared assets in Swiss banks will be able to make a one-off, \"clear the slate\" payment of 21%-41% on their total assets and retain their anonymity. The Swiss will then levy a withholding tax on any future investment income and capital gains banked in Switzerland, set at 27%-48%. That compares with the top 50% rate of tax for funds kept in UK-based banks, due to be cut to 45% as of next year. Tax expert Richard Murphy says this means those wealthy enough to transfer their assets are getting off extremely lightly: \"It's extraordinary. It's legal to hide your money from HMRC now. You can complete a tax return and not put your income on it if it's hidden in a Swiss bank account. This is fundamentally wrong.\" He says it also creates a perverse incentive for the wealthy to move money out of the UK. \"And it gives no opportunity for the Revenue to go back to these people, most of whom have been tax evading for years,\" he adds. \"This is rewarding past crimes.\" A spokesman for HMRC says it is still illegal to hide money anywhere. He agrees that a UK resident does not have to declare income in a Swiss account if they agree to pay the one-off levy, but says that income will be subject to the withholding tax, which could end up higher than the rate they would pay in the UK. The deal was needed to crack open tax evasion cases, he adds, and could generate \u00a34bn-\u00a37bn in revenue. Britain is very much a trailblazer in this regard. Only Greece and Austria have signed similar deals, while Italy is still in negotiations with the Swiss. Germany has agreed a potential deal along the same lines as the UK, but it needs to be ratified by the German parliament and there is substantial opposition from individual states. That became clear last week when reports emerged that one state recently bought information from a whistleblower on potential tax evaders, which could blow a hole in the agreement. North-Rhine Westphalia is said to have paid \u20ac3.5m (\u00a32.7m) for a CD purportedly containing the names of around 1,000 Germans with assets in the Zurich branch of Coutts. Coutts has said: \"Following thorough investigation, we have no evidence to suggest any such breach has taken place.\" This is not the first time such a CD has emerged. In 2010, several German states, including North Rhine-Westphalia, said they had bought CDs containing Swiss banking data, which led to thousands of Germans declaring their financial holdings to avoid going to jail. The US has won more concessions, with a treaty allowing Washington to more easily identify US residents with undeclared Swiss bank accounts. It is also going after the banks themselves. The department of justice has charged Switzerland's oldest private bank, Wegelin &amp; Co, with helping Americans hide more than $1.2bn (\u00a3770m) in secret accounts. It now has an ongoing investigation into 11 more Swiss financial firms and is discussing a settlement that could result in Swiss private banks handing over account data on thousands of US residents. With banking secrecy increasingly under threat, private banks may have to organise ever more trips to the Arctic to keep their customers loyal.",

      "bodyText": "The Home Office is a notorious graveyard of political careers, where the high-flown principles of the stump meet the harsh realities of everything from policing riots to cutting passport queues at Heathrow. So it should have come as no surprise to Theresa May that she has found herself facing furious questions about why soldiers fresh from the field of battle in Afghanistan were being drafted into east London with just days to spare to replace nonexistent Olympic security guards. In these days of mass outsourcing, ministers often hope to palm off the responsibility \u2013 and the cost \u2013 for cock-ups on the ground to hapless corporate managers. But despite the bear-baiting tone of G4S boss Nick Buckles's appearance before the home affairs select committee last week, it was May who was forced to call in the troops. And it will be she who faces the ultimate questions about how the contract was drawn up; why it apparently took officials so long to grasp what was going wrong; and whether the penalty clauses written into the deal with G4S were rigorous enough. The public shaming of Buckles by Keith Vaz and his colleagues should help the government to claw back more cash from G4S than might otherwise have been possible. But when the troops have gone back to their families and the dust has settled on this particular fiasco, politicians should draw some important lessons. For one thing, where the service in question is sufficiently vital \u2013 whether it's the very public jamboree of the Olympics, the care at a local hospital, or making sure the train network keeps running \u2013 the state cannot simply lay off its responsibilities. Ultimately, voters will always, rightly, expect the politicians they elect to be the guarantors of basic, essential services. That means governments can't avoid stepping in to avert a disaster, as a long history of rail franchise renegotiations, backdoor subsidies and ministerial resignations makes clear. So far from handing over the headache to a team of outside experts, contracting-out can mean being lumbered with responsibility without having power or control. George Osborne's \u00a340bn worth of \"UK Guarantees\", announced last week as his latest effort to give the moribund economy a jolt without abandoning his deficit-cutting principles, faces the same problem in a different guise. The Treasury \u2013 ie the taxpayer \u2013 will ultimately be financially responsible if the projects it backs go awry; but once the deal is signed it will have absolutely no control over how they are executed and whether they succeed or fail. The second lesson is that Whitehall bureaucrats don't have a monopoly on bungling. Private sector providers aren't necessarily the slick, smooth operators they can seem when they bid for work. Despite G4S's massive experience, it appears to have bitten off more than it can chew. If the banking crisis taught politicians anything, it should be that having shareholders, a whizzy logo and a worldwide corporate footprint is no guarantee of competence. With a number of police forces actively considering contracting out parts of their job to security firms, it's time to think carefully about what genuine benefits they can bring. If they are to be cheaper for the taxpayer and pay a profit to their shareholders, private contractors need to be more efficient than their Whitehall counterparts by a considerable margin \u2013 but in many cases they are not. Thirdly, the depressing details of the G4S farrago \u2013 demotivated staff, some speaking less-than-perfect English (Buckles professed not to know what \"fluent\" meant in the Commons last week), many of them failing to turn up \u2013 also revealed something about the way the cult of contracting-out feels to the men and women on the ground. A short-term event like the Olympics was always going to require a huge influx of temporary staff, but G4S appears to have treated its recruits with the kind of chaotic disregard usually reserved for the late-night cleaners and security guards who keep the capital running all year round. Businesses that have listened to London's tireless Living Wage campaigners over the past 10 years have found that bringing services in-house, and using permanent staff instead of a shifting kaleidoscope of temporary workers, can deliver better loyalty, motivation and performance \u2013 but these are benefits that will never show up in the price of a contract. That argument has to be writ large in any profession, from policing to elderly care, where the motivations and the integrity of staff are at the heart of whether the service will succeed. Opening up new areas for private sector providers in the hope of promoting competition and forcing civil servants to raise their game was a key part of Tony Blair's drive for \"public sector reform\", which recent interviews alarmingly suggest he might be keen to revive through a new role in public life. But that was an agenda for a period in which the illusion of corporate efficiency and integrity had been less tarnished by failed computer projects, shady financial dealings and the sheer greed of kleptocratic top management. Of course there is expertise, and plenty of examples of best practice, to be found far beyond the precincts of Whitehall. But May's embarrassment over who would be turning up to guard the world's athletes is a forceful reminder that contracting out is very different from abrogating responsibility \u2013 or shifting financial risk.",

There, analysts are sure to ask chief executive Ralph Topping about his campaign against Betdaq's rival, Betfair, which has just fallen at yet another fence (its lawyers, inevitably, hint at an appeal). In that case, William Hill argued that betting exchange customers should be classed as bookmakers \u2013 and therefore be compelled to fund UK racing.

The story just refuses to conk out. Each way bet At the start of the year, the high street bookmaker Ladbrokes admitted to starting talks with its 2% shareholder, Irish billionaire Dermot Desmond, about a \"technology\" deal with his betting exchange, Betdaq. Things have moved on, as Ladbrokes is now talking to the Irishman about buying the whole lot. The negotiations represent the latest attempt by the bookie's chief executive Richard Glynn to acquire an online rival to plug gaps in his struggling website, following aborted talks with both Sportingbet and 888. But the intriguing angle this time is the suggestion that Glynn's latest tilt is not motivated by a fondness for negotiation, but because rival William Hill may have been sniffing around Betdaq too. William Hill declines to comment on this, although it might be more forthcoming when quizzed at its results this week. There, analysts are sure to ask chief executive Ralph Topping about his campaign against Betdaq's rival, Betfair, which has just fallen at yet another fence (its lawyers, inevitably, hint at an appeal). In that case, William Hill argued that betting exchange customers should be classed as bookmakers \u2013 and therefore be compelled to fund UK racing. Simultaneously, Hills might also have been talking to Desmond. That's hedging your bets.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A global super-rich elite has exploited gaps in cross-border tax rules to hide an extraordinary \u00a313 trillion ($21tn) of wealth offshore \u2013 as much as the American and Japanese GDPs put together \u2013 according to research commissioned by the campaign group Tax Justice Network. James Henry, former chief economist at consultancy McKinsey and an expert on tax havens, has compiled the most detailed estimates yet of the size of the offshore economy in a new report, The Price of Offshore Revisited, released exclusively to the Observer. He shows that at least \u00a313tn \u2013 perhaps up to \u00a320tn \u2013 has leaked out of scores of countries into secretive jurisdictions such as Switzerland and the Cayman Islands with the help of private banks, which vie to attract the assets of so-called high net-worth individuals. Their wealth is, as Henry puts it, \u201cprotected by a highly paid, industrious bevy of professional enablers in the private banking, legal, accounting and investment industries taking advantage of the increasingly borderless, frictionless global economy\u201d. According to Henry\u2019s research, the top 10 private banks, which include UBS and Credit Suisse in Switzerland, as well as the US investment bank Goldman Sachs, managed more than \u00a34tn in 2010, a sharp rise from \u00a31.5tn five years earlier. The detailed analysis in the report, compiled using data from a range of sources, including the Bank of International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund, suggests that for many developing countries the cumulative value of the capital that has flowed out of their economies since the 1970s would be more than enough to pay off their debts to the rest of the world. Oil-rich states with an internationally mobile elite have been especially prone to watching their wealth disappear into offshore bank accounts instead of being invested at home, the research suggests. Once the returns on investing the hidden assets is included, almost \u00a3500bn has left Russia since the early 1990s when its economy was opened up. Saudi Arabia has seen \u00a3197bn flood out since the mid-1970s, and Nigeria \u00a3196bn. \u201cThe problem here is that the assets of these countries are held by a small number of wealthy individuals while the debts are shouldered by the ordinary people of these countries through their governments,\u201d the report says. The sheer size of the cash pile sitting out of reach of tax authorities is so great that it suggests standard measures of inequality radically underestimate the true gap between rich and poor. According to Henry\u2019s calculations, \u00a36.3tn of assets is owned by only 92,000 people, or 0.001% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 a tiny class of the mega-rich who have more in common with each other than those at the bottom of the income scale in their own societies. \u201cThese estimates reveal a staggering failure: inequality is much, much worse than official statistics show, but politicians are still relying on trickle-down to transfer wealth to poorer people,\u201d said John Christensen of the Tax Justice Network. \u201cPeople on the street have no illusions about how unfair the situation has become.\u201d TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: \u201cCountries around the world are under intense pressure to reduce their deficits and governments cannot afford to let so much wealth slip past into tax havens. \u201cClosing down the tax loopholes exploited by multinationals and the super-rich to avoid paying their fair share will reduce the deficit. This way the government can focus on stimulating the economy, rather than squeezing the life out of it with cuts and tax rises for the 99% of people who aren\u2019t rich enough to avoid paying their taxes.\u201d Assuming the \u00a313tn mountain of assets earned an average 3% a year for its owners, and governments were able to tax that income at 30%, it would generate a bumper \u00a3121bn in revenues \u2013 more than rich countries spend on aid to the developing world each year. Groups such as UK Uncut have focused attention on the paltry tax bills of some highly wealthy individuals, such as Topshop owner Sir Philip Green, with campaigners at one recent protest shouting: \u201cWhere did all the money go? He took it off to Monaco!\u201d Much of Green\u2019s retail empire is owned by his wife, Tina, who lives in the low-tax principality. A spokeswoman for UK Uncut said: \u201cPeople like Philip Green use public services \u2013 they need the streets to be cleaned, people need public transport to get to their shops \u2013 but they don\u2019t want to pay for it.\u201d Leaders of G20 countries have repeatedly pledged to close down tax havens since the financial crisis of 2008, when the secrecy shrouding parts of the banking system was widely seen as exacerbating instability. But many countries still refuse to make details of individuals\u2019 financial worth available to the tax authorities in their home countries as a matter of course. Tax Justice Network would like to see this kind of exchange of information become standard practice, to prevent rich individuals playing off one jurisdiction against another. \u201cThe very existence of the global offshore industry, and the tax-free status of the enormous sums invested by their wealthy clients, is predicated on secrecy,\u201d said Henry.",

Saudi Arabia has seen \u00a3197bn flood out since the mid-1970s, and Nigeria \u00a3196bn.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem here is that the assets of these countries are held by a small number of wealthy individuals while the debts are shouldered by the ordinary people of these countries through their governments,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>The sheer size of the cash pile sitting out of reach of tax authorities is so great that it suggests standard measures of inequality radically underestimate the true gap between rich and poor. According to Henry\u2019s calculations, \u00a36.3tn of assets is owned by only 92,000 people, or 0.001% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 a tiny class of the mega-rich who have more in common with each other than those at the bottom of the income scale in their own societies.</p> <p>\u201cThese estimates reveal a staggering failure: inequality is much, much worse than official statistics show, but politicians are still relying on trickle-down to transfer wealth to poorer people,\u201d said John Christensen of the Tax Justice Network. \u201cPeople on the street have no illusions about how unfair the situation has become.\u201d</p> <p>TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: \u201cCountries around the world are under intense pressure to reduce their deficits and governments cannot afford to let so much wealth slip past into tax havens.</p> <p>\u201cClosing down the tax loopholes exploited by multinationals and the super-rich to avoid paying their fair share will reduce the deficit. This way the government can focus on stimulating the economy, rather than squeezing the life out of it with cuts and tax rises for the 99% of people who aren\u2019t rich enough to avoid paying their taxes.\u201d</p> <p>Assuming the \u00a313tn mountain of assets earned an average 3% a year for its owners, and governments were able to tax that income at 30%, it would generate a bumper \u00a3121bn in revenues \u2013 more than rich countries spend on aid to the developing world each year.</p> <p>Groups such as UK Uncut have focused attention on the paltry tax bills of some highly wealthy individuals, such as Topshop owner Sir Philip Green, with campaigners at one recent protest shouting: \u201cWhere did all the money go? He took it off to Monaco!\u201d Much of Green\u2019s retail empire is owned by his wife, Tina, who lives in the low-tax principality.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for UK Uncut said: \u201cPeople like Philip Green use public services \u2013 they need the streets to be cleaned, people need public transport to get to their shops \u2013 but they don\u2019t want to pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>Leaders of G20 countries have repeatedly pledged to close down tax havens since the financial crisis of 2008, when the secrecy shrouding parts of the banking system was widely seen as exacerbating instability. But many countries still refuse to make details of individuals\u2019 financial worth available to the tax authorities in their home countries as a matter of course. Tax Justice Network would like to see this kind of exchange of information become standard practice, to prevent rich individuals playing off one jurisdiction against another.</p> <p>\u201cThe very existence of the global offshore industry, and the tax-free status of the enormous sums invested by their wealthy clients, is predicated on secrecy,\u201d said Henry.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The world's super-rich have taken advantage of lax tax rules to siphon off at least $21 trillion, and possibly as much as $32tn, from their home countries and hide it abroad \u2013 a sum larger than the entire American economy. James Henry, a former chief economist at consultancy McKinsey and an expert on tax havens, has conducted groundbreaking new research for the Tax Justice Network campaign group \u2013 sifting through data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and private sector analysts to construct an alarming picture that shows capital flooding out of countries across the world and disappearing into the cracks in the financial system. Comedian Jimmy Carr became the public face of tax-dodging in the UK earlier this year when it emerged that he had made use of a Cayman Islands-based trust to slash his income tax bill. But the kind of scheme Carr took part in is the tip of the iceberg, according to Henry's report, entitled The Price of Offshore Revisited. Despite the professed determination of the G20 group of leading economies to tackle tax secrecy, investors in scores of countries \u2013 including the US and the UK \u2013 are still able to hide some or all of their assets from the taxman. \"This offshore economy is large enough to have a major impact on estimates of inequality of wealth and income; on estimates of national income and debt ratios; and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 to have very significant negative impacts on the domestic tax bases of 'source' countries,\" Henry says. Using the BIS's measure of \"offshore deposits\" \u2013 cash held outside the depositor's home country \u2013 and scaling it up according to the proportion of their portfolio large investors usually hold in cash, he estimates that between $21tn (\u00a313tn) and $32tn (\u00a320tn) in financial assets has been hidden from the world's tax authorities. \"These estimates reveal a staggering failure,\" says John Christensen of the Tax Justice Network. \"Inequality is much, much worse than official statistics show, but politicians are still relying on trickle-down to transfer wealth to poorer people. \"This new data shows the exact opposite has happened: for three decades extraordinary wealth has been cascading into the offshore accounts of a tiny number of super-rich.\" In total, 10 million individuals around the world hold assets offshore, according to Henry's analysis; but almost half of the minimum estimate of $21tn \u2013 $9.8tn \u2013 is owned by just 92,000 people. And that does not include the non-financial assets \u2013 art, yachts, mansions in Kensington \u2013 that many of the world's movers and shakers like to use as homes for their immense riches. \"If we could figure out how to tax all this offshore wealth without killing the proverbial golden goose, or at least entice its owners to reinvest it back home, this sector of the global underground is easily large enough to make a significant contribution to tax justice, investment and paying the costs of global problems like climate change,\" Henry says. He corroborates his findings by using national accounts to assemble estimates of the cumulative capital flight from more than 130 low- to middle-income countries over almost 40 years, and the returns their wealthy owners are likely to have made from them. In many cases, , the total worth of these assets far exceeds the value of the overseas debts of the countries they came from. The struggles of the authorities in Egypt to recover the vast sums hidden abroad by Hosni Mubarak, his family and other cronies during his many years in power have provided a striking recent example of the fact that kleptocratic rulers can use their time to amass immense fortunes while many of their citizens are trapped in poverty. The world's poorest countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, have fought long and hard in recent years to receive debt forgiveness from the international community; but this research suggests that in many cases, if they had been able to draw their richest citizens into the tax net, they could have avoided being dragged into indebtedness in the first place. Oil-rich Nigeria has seen more than $300bn spirited away since 1970, for example, while Ivory Coast has lost $141bn. Assuming that super-rich investors earn a relatively modest 3% a year on their $21tn, taxing that vast wall of money at 30% would generate a very useful $189bn a year \u2013 more than rich economies spend on aid to the rest of the world. The sheer scale of the hidden assets held by the super-rich also suggests that standard measures of inequality, which tend to rely on surveys of household income or wealth in individual countries, radically underestimate the true gap between rich and poor. Milorad Kovacevic, chief statistician of the UN Development Programme's Human Development Report, says both the very wealthy and the very poor tend to be excluded from mainstream calculations of inequality. \"People that are in charge of measuring inequality based on survey data know that the both ends of the distribution are underrepresented \u2013 or, even better, misrepresented,\" he says. \"There is rarely a household from the top 1% earners that participates in the survey. On the other side, the poor people either don't have addresses to be selected into the sample, or when selected they misquote their earnings \u2013 usually biasing them upwards.\" Inequality is widely seen as having increased sharply in many developed countries over the past decade or more \u2013 as described in a recent paper from the IMF, which showed marked increases in the so-called Gini coefficient, which economists use to measure how evenly income is shared across societies. Globalisation has exposed low-skilled workers to competition from cheap economies such as China, while the surging profitability of the financial services industry \u2013 and the spread of the big bonus culture before the credit crunch \u2013 led to what economists have called a \"racing away\" at the top of the income scale. However, Henry's research suggests that this acknowledged jump in inequality is a dramatic underestimate. Stewart Lansley, author of the recent book The Cost of Inequality, says: \"There is absolutely no doubt at all that the statistics on income and wealth at the top understate the problem.\" The surveys that are used to compile the Gini coefficient \"simply don't touch the super-rich,\" he says. \"You don't pick up the multimillionaires and billionaires, and even if you do, you can't pick it up properly.\" In fact, some experts believe the amount of assets being held offshore is so large that accounting for it fully would radically alter the balance of financial power between countries. The French economist Thomas Piketty, an expert on inequality who helps compile the World Top Incomes Database, says research by his colleagues has shown that \"the wealth held in tax havens is probably sufficiently substantial to turn Europe into a very large net creditor with respect to the rest of the world.\" In other words, even a solution to the eurozone's seemingly endless sovereign debt crisis might be within reach \u2013 if only Europe's governments could get a grip on the wallets of their own wealthiest citizens. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 July.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Embattled security group G4S is bidding for contracts worth more than \u00a32bn to run five prisons. The revelation is likely to trigger a furore among the company's increasingly long list of critics and renew the often feverish debate about the extent to which the private sector should run public services. News that the army and police have had to be drafted in to provide security at the Olympics because G4S is unable to fulfil its contract to supply 10,000 stewards has triggered calls for the company's chief executive, Nick Buckles, to resign. Last week, MPs on the public accounts committee expressed concerns that management costs associated with the contract had soared from \u00a310m to \u00a3125m, prompting concerns that the taxpayer was not getting value for money. Now unions are questioning whether G4S's failures over the Olympics should preclude it from running more prisons. G4S already operates Parc, Altcourse, Oakwood, Birmingham and Wolds prisons. But, under the government's Competition Strategy for Offender Services, announced in July 2011, it has emerged that it is also bidding to run Northumberland, Hatfield, Lindholme, Moorland and Onley prisons as well as to renew the contract for Wolds. The probation officers' union, Napo, estimates each contract could see G4S paid as much as \u00a340,000 per prisoner a year over the life of the 15-year contracts, which will be awarded in November. If G4S were to be successful in all of its bids, it is estimated that the total value of the contracts would exceed \u00a32bn. Supporters of the private sector say bringing in outside contractors will save the taxpayer money by helping to cut out inefficiencies associated with the public sector. But critics question whether G4S will offer value for money, given recent events. They also claim there is little oversight of how public sector contracts are awarded to private companies \u2013 or redress for taxpayers if costs soar. \"The fiasco involving G4S and the Olympics has shown again how there is little if any accountability to the state and how contracts are far from transparent,\" said Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of Napo, who claimed an absence of a \"level playing field between the private and public sector\". The Prison Officers Association has written to justice secretary Kenneth Clarke saying the Games fiasco highlights the perils in \"relying solely on private firms for security\". Steve Gillan, the association's general secretary, told Clarke: \"I urge you strongly, to think long and hard before any more prisons contracts are handed over to private firms to engage. I fear this is a race to the bottom \u2013 and prisons are safer and more accountable when they are run by the public sector.\" Questions are also being asked about the role played by Serco, the private contractor drafted in to protect Britain's ports during the Olympics. In mid-May, concerns about queues at ports forced the Home Office to bring in private guards to operate radiation screens designed to detect \"dirty bombs\" being smuggled through major ports. The scheme is part of Programme Cyclamen, a joint initiative between the Border Agency and the Home Office. Under Cyclamen, most sea and rail traffic , including containers, freight, vehicles and passengers, is screened as it goes through UK ports. A memo from a senior Border Force official reveals that some guards employed by Serco at Dover cannot be contacted because of problems with their radios. It also observes that vehicle screening problems that began before Serco became involved have continued. It notes that, because of \"communication issues that need to be resolved\", projected cost savings arising from the hiring of Serco staff are not being realised and that \"there have been occasions when BF [Border Force] officers have had to correct errors by Serco staff when capturing alarmed vehicles\". Serco will come under further scrutiny on Monday when the home affairs select committee condemns the backlog of outstanding cases that the agency is failing to clear. A Border Force spokesman said: \"Security of the UK border remains our top priority and all staff are fully trained to operate their role. Serco staff work alongside Border Force officers and will be expected to adhere to the same high standards as our own staff.\"",

Steve Gillan, the association's general secretary, told Clarke: \"I urge you strongly, to think long and hard before any more prisons contracts are handed over to private firms to engage. I fear this is a race to the bottom \u2013 and prisons are safer and more accountable when they are run by the public sector.\"</p> <p>Questions are also being asked about the role played by Serco, the private contractor drafted in to protect Britain's ports during the Olympics. In mid-May, concerns about queues at ports forced the Home Office to bring in private guards to operate radiation screens designed to detect \"dirty bombs\" being smuggled through major ports.</p> <p>The scheme is part of Programme Cyclamen, a joint initiative between the Border Agency and the Home Office. Under Cyclamen, most sea and rail traffic , including containers, freight, vehicles and passengers, is screened as it goes through UK ports.</p> <p>A memo from a senior Border Force official reveals that some guards employed by Serco at Dover cannot be contacted because of problems with their radios. It also observes that vehicle screening problems that began before Serco became involved have continued. It notes that, because of \"communication issues that need to be resolved\", projected cost savings arising from the hiring of Serco staff are not being realised and that \"there have been occasions when BF [Border Force] officers have had to correct errors by Serco staff when capturing alarmed vehicles\".</p> <p>Serco will come under further scrutiny on Monday when the home affairs select committee condemns the backlog of outstanding cases that the agency is failing to clear. A Border Force spokesman said: \"Security of the UK border remains our top priority and all staff are fully trained to operate their role. Serco staff work alongside Border Force officers and will be expected to adhere to the same high standards as our own staff.\"</p>",
