      "bodyText": "After a calm start, markets headed south again as speculation swirled round about Standard &amp; Poor's downgrading of a number of eurozone members. Among the biggest fallers was Vodafone, down 2.5% or 4.5p to 175p on concerns about the effect of the current crisis on its European business.

      "bodyText": "The economic difficulties in the UK or the eurozone cannot be usefully analysed without looking at these economies' positions in the world. The UK and the eurozone also have an immediate problem with debt and an ongoing problem with productivity. It is unlikely that Keynesian aggregate demand management alone will lead to long-run sustained growth. What are the facts on the UK and the eurozone in the global economy? Time was, the night-time sky was lit up pretty much just by the Transatlantic axis. But that was 30 years ago, and the global economy has moved on. By 2010 the world's economic centre had shifted 5,000 km \u2013 three-quarters of the Earth's radius \u2013 from the rise of the east, notably India and China. As a consequence, hundreds of millions of Asians have been lifted out of grinding poverty; soon these people will be the world's middle income class. That figure of the great shift east takes in grubby calculations with thousands of data points. But its point can be appreciated in many different ways, some more vivid than others (eg the view from the US). To be clear, not all Europe needs help in the same way.

But now, in the receding tide, Americans are beginning to see not only that those with taller masts had been lifted far higher, but also that many of the smaller boats had been dashed to pieces in their wake.</p> <p>In that brief moment when the tide was indeed rising, millions of people believed that they might have a fair chance of realising the \"American Dream\". Now those dreams, too, are receding. By 2011, the savings of those who had lost their jobs in 2008 or 2009 had been spent. Unemployment cheques had run out. Headlines announcing new hiring \u2013 still not enough to keep pace with the number of those who would normally have entered the labour force \u2013 meant little to the 50-year-olds with little hope of ever holding a job again.</p> <p>Indeed, middle-aged people who thought that they would be unemployed for a few months have now realised that they were, in fact, forcibly retired. Young people who graduated from college with tens of thousands of dollars of education debt cannot find any jobs at all. People who moved in with friends and relatives have become homeless. Houses bought during the property boom are still on the market or have been sold at a loss. More than seven million American families have lost their homes.</p> <p>The dark underbelly of the previous decade's financial boom has been fully exposed in Europe as well. Dithering over Greece and key national governments' devotion to austerity began to exact a heavy toll last year. Contagion spread to Italy. Spain's unemployment, which had been near 20% since the beginning of the recession, crept even higher. The unthinkable \u2013 the end of the euro \u2013 began to seem like a real possibility.</p> <p>This year is set to be even worse. It is possible, of course, that the United States will solve its political problems and finally adopt the stimulus measures that it needs to bring down unemployment to 6% or 7% (the pre-crisis level of 4% or 5% is too much to hope for). But this is as unlikely as it is that Europe will figure out that austerity alone will not solve its problems. On the contrary, austerity will only exacerbate the economic slowdown. Without growth, the debt crisis \u2013 and the euro crisis \u2013 will only worsen. And the long crisis that began with the collapse of the housing bubble in 2007 and the subsequent recession will continue.</p> <p>Moreover, the major emerging-market countries, which steered successfully through the storms of 2008 and 2009, may not cope as well with the problems looming on the horizon. Brazil's growth has already stalled, fuelling anxiety among its neighbours in Latin America.</p> <p>Meanwhile, long-term problems \u2013 including climate change and other environmental threats, and increasing inequality in most countries around the world \u2013 have not gone away. Some have grown more severe. For example, high unemployment has depressed wages and increased poverty.</p> <h2>Good news</h2> <p>The good news is that addressing these long-term problems would actually help to solve the short-term problems. Increased investment to retro-fit the economy for global warming would help to stimulate economic activity, growth, and job creation. More progressive taxation, in effect redistributing income from the top to the middle and bottom, would simultaneously reduce inequality and increase employment by boosting total demand. Higher taxes at the top could generate revenues to finance needed public investment, and to provide some social protection for those at the bottom, including the unemployed.</p> <p>Even without widening the fiscal deficit, such \"balanced budget\" increases in taxes and spending would lower unemployment and increase output. The worry, however, is that politics and ideology on both sides of the Atlantic, but especially in the US, will not allow any of this to occur. Fixation on the deficit will induce cutbacks in social spending, worsening inequality. Likewise, the enduring attraction of supply-side economics, despite all of the evidence against it (especially in a period in which there is high unemployment), will prevent raising taxes at the top.</p> <p>Even before the crisis, there was a rebalancing of economic power \u2013 in fact, a correction of a 200-year historical anomaly, in which Asia's share of global GDP fell from nearly 50% to, at one point, below 10%. The pragmatic commitment to growth that one sees in Asia and other emerging markets today stands in contrast to the west's misguided policies, which, driven by a combination of ideology and vested interests, almost seem to reflect a commitment not to grow.</p> <p>As a result, global economic rebalancing is likely to accelerate, almost inevitably giving rise to political tensions. With all of the problems confronting the global economy, we will be lucky if these strains do not begin to manifest themselves within the next 12 months.</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2012</p>",

Young people who graduated from college with tens of thousands of dollars of education debt cannot find any jobs at all. People who moved in with friends and relatives have become homeless. Houses bought during the property boom are still on the market or have been sold at a loss. More than seven million American families have lost their homes. The dark underbelly of the previous decade's financial boom has been fully exposed in Europe as well. Dithering over Greece and key national governments' devotion to austerity began to exact a heavy toll last year. Contagion spread to Italy. Spain's unemployment, which had been near 20% since the beginning of the recession, crept even higher. The unthinkable \u2013 the end of the euro \u2013 began to seem like a real possibility. This year is set to be even worse. It is possible, of course, that the United States will solve its political problems and finally adopt the stimulus measures that it needs to bring down unemployment to 6% or 7% (the pre-crisis level of 4% or 5% is too much to hope for). But this is as unlikely as it is that Europe will figure out that austerity alone will not solve its problems. On the contrary, austerity will only exacerbate the economic slowdown. Without growth, the debt crisis \u2013 and the euro crisis \u2013 will only worsen. And the long crisis that began with the collapse of the housing bubble in 2007 and the subsequent recession will continue. Moreover, the major emerging-market countries, which steered successfully through the storms of 2008 and 2009, may not cope as well with the problems looming on the horizon. Brazil's growth has already stalled, fuelling anxiety among its neighbours in Latin America. Meanwhile, long-term problems \u2013 including climate change and other environmental threats, and increasing inequality in most countries around the world \u2013 have not gone away. Some have grown more severe. For example, high unemployment has depressed wages and increased poverty. Good news The good news is that addressing these long-term problems would actually help to solve the short-term problems. Increased investment to retro-fit the economy for global warming would help to stimulate economic activity, growth, and job creation. More progressive taxation, in effect redistributing income from the top to the middle and bottom, would simultaneously reduce inequality and increase employment by boosting total demand. Higher taxes at the top could generate revenues to finance needed public investment, and to provide some social protection for those at the bottom, including the unemployed. Even without widening the fiscal deficit, such \"balanced budget\" increases in taxes and spending would lower unemployment and increase output. The worry, however, is that politics and ideology on both sides of the Atlantic, but especially in the US, will not allow any of this to occur. Fixation on the deficit will induce cutbacks in social spending, worsening inequality. Likewise, the enduring attraction of supply-side economics, despite all of the evidence against it (especially in a period in which there is high unemployment), will prevent raising taxes at the top. Even before the crisis, there was a rebalancing of economic power \u2013 in fact, a correction of a 200-year historical anomaly, in which Asia's share of global GDP fell from nearly 50% to, at one point, below 10%. The pragmatic commitment to growth that one sees in Asia and other emerging markets today stands in contrast to the west's misguided policies, which, driven by a combination of ideology and vested interests, almost seem to reflect a commitment not to grow. As a result, global economic rebalancing is likely to accelerate, almost inevitably giving rise to political tensions. With all of the problems confronting the global economy, we will be lucky if these strains do not begin to manifest themselves within the next 12 months. Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2012",

Ford and the other two big Detroit carmakers, Chrysler and General Motors, all logged double-digit sales growth last year, helping fuel a 10.3% increase in the US sales to 12.8m vehicles, the highest since 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Logghe/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-384367161\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/12/1326393248448/Tower-Bridge-left-and-Cit-031.jpg\" alt=\"Week in business: Tower Bridge, left, and City Hall, are seen illuminated \" width=\"719\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the biggest changes to the internet since its inception 30 years ago will began, with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jan/08/internet-address-regime-expanded\">the launch of the so-called \"dot brand\" names allowing anyone to register any web address suffix for $185,000 (\u00a3119,000)</a>.

The protests and mass strike follow the government's announcement on 1 January that it would discontinue a state fuel subsidy programme, which has kept fuel cheap for decades. Overnight, petrol pump prices in Africa's largest oil-producing country more than doubled to about $1 per litre.
