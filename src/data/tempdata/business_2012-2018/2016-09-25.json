      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s financial services are becoming increasingly anxious about life after the Brexit vote, according to the latest detailed survey of confidence in the sector. Optimism dropped for the third consecutive quarter in the three months to September, according to the research jointly produced by the CBI business lobby group and the accountancy firm PwC. It marked the longest run of deteriorating sentiment since the first quarter of 2009, when the global financial system was in the midst of a deep and prolonged crisis. The biggest drop in confidence was among finance houses, building societies and investment managers, and less so among banks. Optimism was broadly stable among life and general insurance providers. When asked to list their main concerns over Brexit, financial firms cited the top three risks as a negative impact on the economy, changes in access to EU markets and the prospect of lower yields. Andrew Kail, the head of UK financial services at PwC, said the continuing fall in confidence was a cause for concern, adding that businesses were considering moving their operations out of Britain because of the vote and uncertainty over future trading agreements. \u201cIt\u2019s still early days and there is no real clarity on what future agreements will be reached. Consequently, many of our clients are considering their options, including potential restructuring and relocation of their businesses.\u201d Kail said there was a danger Britain\u2019s standing as a major financial hub might be damaged. \u201cTwo million people across the UK are directly or indirectly employed by the financial services sector.\u201d He said prolonged low interest rates, as well as complexities caused by changing regulations and technology, were all challenges facing the sector. \u201cBrexit has added an additional ingredient to the mixture.\u201d Of the 115 firms surveyed, 15% said they were more optimistic about overall business conditions, compared with three months ago, while 28% were less optimistic. That gave a balance of -13%, and comes just after a -16% balance for the previous quarter. Despite the drop in confidence, business and profits actually picked up in the sector over the three months. Business volumes were higher for 48% of firms, and lower for 13%, giving a rounded-up balance of +35%, compared with +22% in June. \u201cAs firms get back into the swing of things after the summer and continue to digest the implications of the EU Referendum, it\u2019s good to see that demand in the financial services sector has held up,\u201d said Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist. \u201cBut the challenges facing the sector have not gone away \u2013 they\u2019ve actually grown. Add the uncertainty caused by Brexit to low interest rates, technological change and strong competition, and it\u2019s plain to see why optimism is falling and pressure on margins remains intense.\u201d Newton-Smith said central to concerns about Brexit was the risk it posed to the wider economy in the years ahead. More than half of companies in the financial services sector felt the general impact of the vote was negative. About one in 10 said the impact was positive. She urged the government to calm fears within the financial community by communicating clear plans for negotiations to leave the EU and by producing an \u201cambitious\u201d autumn statement on 23 November that sets out a clear direction for growth. The Bank of England responded in August to the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote by announcing a package of measures that include a reduction in interest rates to an all-time low of 0.25%. Earlier this month, the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee left the door open to another interest rate cut this year. Employment was stable in the financial services sector in the third quarter, the CBI/PwC survey found. It was expected to pick up over the next quarter, with job creation planned in most areas, though not in life insurance. In the year ahead, financial services firms expect to increase IT and marketing capital spending at a faster pace, but scale back other investments, albeit to a lesser degree than in the previous quarter.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers insisted they have a crucial role to play in a post-Brexit world, contributing $247bn (\u00a3190bn) a year to the economy and creating well-paid, high-value jobs. The UK is the world\u2019s ninth-largest industrial nation and manufacturing accounts for 14% of business investment according to a report by the sector\u2019s trade body, called EEF, and Santander. But it comes at a time of huge uncertainty for manufacturers, with companies intending to cut investment in new plant and machinery to its lowest level since the financial crisis according to a survey published by EEF earlier this month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, said: \u201cGiven the importance of manufacturing to the economy it\u2019s vital that we educate all stakeholders about its real value and contribution to growth. This is especially important in a post-Brexit world where we have to look at all new avenues of generating growth and investment.\u201d As chancellor Philip Hammond prepares to deliver his maiden autumn statement on 23 November, the group has called for an ambitious industrial strategy to make the UK an appealing proposition for future manufacturing investment. Hammond is expected to announce a programme of investment in transport and other infrastructure projects to give the economy a post-Brexit-vote boost. Reports over the weekend suggested Theresa May has instructed the chancellor to extend the northern powerhouse initiative \u2013 conceived by his predecessor in number 11, George Osborne \u2013 to other UK regions. Hammond has already signalled that he is willing to \u201creset\u201d the public finances to support the economy, abandoning Osborne\u2019s target of returning to a surplus of \u00a310.4bn by 2019-20. It is hoped that Britain\u2019s factories will be able to capitalise on the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the UK voted to leave the EU. A weak pound makes British goods cheaper abroad, potentially boosting exports. EEF said Britain is having an industrial renaissance, with manufacturers creating jobs at a faster rate than any other country apart from the US since 2010. The sector\u2019s average annual earnings of about \u00a331,500 are almost \u00a34,000 above the figure for the whole economy, it added. London and the south-east are the biggest manufacturing regions, just ahead of the north-west and the midlands.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BP\u2019s publicly available plans to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight don\u2019t give a clear indication of where it would get all the people, boats and aircraft needed to contain a major oil spill in the remote waters 300km off the coast of South Australia, according to the Wilderness Society. BP says it is confident its plans \u201care appropriate\u201d but says \u201cthe regulator will ultimately determine if this is the case\u201d. BP has proposed to drill for oil inside a commonwealth marine reserve. Its first two environmental plans were rejected after the regulator found they did not meet its requirements. A decision about its third plan is expected to be made next week. In the summary of its oil spill response plan, BP made clear physical containment strategies \u2013 such as booms and skimmers \u2013 were likely to be of \u201climited effectiveness\u201d in the rough seas of the Bight, where the oil slick would be broken up by waves. But when BP was responsible for the world\u2019s largest oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, it heavily relied on these strategies, deploying thousands of kilometres of booms to contain the spill. BP said in the Bight it would rely mostly on chemical dispersants. But it said those dispersants might not be deployed until 10 days after a spill, while some regions could get hit with an oil slick after just nine days. After BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon disaster, more than 6,000 boats, 100 aircraft, 45,000 personnel and 17,500 National Guard troops were deployed. But BP\u2019s publicly released plans for managing a spill in the Bight didn\u2019t explain where it would source all that equipment and people. In its short summary of what it would do if there was a major oil spill, BP indicated many of its planned containment strategies were unlikely to be effective at stopping oil from spreading. It said it would need to rely on direct protection of shorelines in many cases. But BP said in the case of some parts of Kangaroo Island, that wouldn\u2019t be effective, owing to the shoreline being \u201cvery exposed\u201d and subject to very large waves. The Wilderness Society said that meant Kangaroo Island\u2019s west coast would likely be hit by an oil slick if there was a blowout. BP insists they \u201cwill implement the most effective response strategies given the circumstances\u201d and that \u201cKangaroo Island has been identified as one of five priority areas in the Great Australian Bight\u201d. Despite the Bight having very rough water and famously high wind speeds, BP didn\u2019t make public any modelling of how often its containment strategies would be available to be used. When it comes to protecting wildlife, BP said its first response would be to prevent them entering the affected areas or to capture and remove animals at risk. The national director of the Wilderness Society, Lyndon Schneiders, said the document made public by BP was too short to count as serious consultation with the public. He said when Shell proposed to drill for oil in the Arctic it released a 438-page oil spill response plan. \u201cBP is treating Australians like mugs if the company thinks this flimsy document will wash given BP\u2019s woeful performance in the Gulf of Mexico,\u201d said Schneiders. BP responded, telling Guardian Australia it was confident it had \u201cconsulted extensively and adequately, but the regulator will ultimately determine if this is the case\u201d. The Greens senator for South Australia Sarah Hanson-Young said BP\u2019s response plan made for \u201csobering reading\u201d. \u201cAll this document really confirms is that there are neither the resources nor the planning in place to contain a serious spill,\u201d she said. \u201cIf this is the best that BP can do, then I think it\u2019s clear why the Gulf of Mexico spill was such a catastrophic disaster. \u201cThe Great Australian Bight is a natural wonder and I hope Nopsema does the right thing here by rejecting BP\u2019s application, once and for all.\u201d The Wilderness Society South Australia director, Peter Owen, said: \u201cBP was responsible for the world\u2019s biggest oil spill disaster, the Deepwater Horizon tragedy in 2010, when 800m litres of oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico for 87 days.\u201d \u201cOnly about 25% of the oil was recovered, leaving half a billion litres of oil in the gulf. Millions of litres of toxic oil dispersants were sprayed into the Gulf\u2019s waters. The spill and cleanup killed millions of fish, an estimated 800,000 birds and 75,000 dolphins and whales. \u201cAustralia\u2019s offshore oil and gas authority, Nopsema, must finally end this farce and finally reject BP\u2019s application to drill in the Bight.\u201d",

But it said those dispersants might not be deployed until 10 days after a spill, while some regions could get hit with an oil slick after just nine days.</p> <p>After BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon disaster, more than 6,000 boats, 100 aircraft, 45,000 personnel and 17,500 National Guard troops were deployed. But BP\u2019s publicly released plans for managing a spill in the Bight didn\u2019t explain where it would source all that equipment and people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/12/call-to-halt-great-australian-bight-oil-drilling-amid-faulty-equipment-fears\">Call to halt Great Australian Bight oil drilling amid faulty equipment fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In its short summary of what it would do if there was a major oil spill, BP indicated many of its planned containment strategies were unlikely to be effective at stopping oil from spreading. </p> <p>It said it would need to rely on direct protection of shorelines in many cases.

      "bodyText": "BHS is poised to make a comeback as an online retailer just one month after the brand closed its last remaining high-street store. The business will be relaunched on Thursday, selling lighting and home furnishing products before adding clothing lines and kitchen and dining ranges over the coming weeks. BHS collapsed into administration in April, leading to the loss of about 11,000 jobs and leaving a pension deficit of \u00a3571m. BHS.com will be a smaller operation, with just 84 employees based in London and fewer products initially on offer. It will focus on former BHS bestsellers, such as bedding and lighting, and by November new clothing ranges will be available. The online business is owned by the Al Mana Group, a Qatari conglomerate that created BHS International when it bought the BHS brand, BHS.com and the retailer\u2019s international operations in June. It will be run by David Anderson, the former head of international at BHS, who said the new business would \u201cbe nimble and efficient\u201d. Commenting on the the brand\u2019s relaunch in Britain, Anderson said he was not ruling out opening new stores in the future. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve got to do is look forward. This is a new business. It\u2019s an iconic British brand, steeped in history. We want to focus on that and move forward. Will we ever be international online or go back to bricks and mortar? Who knows? In retail you can\u2019t rule anything out, it\u2019s ever-changing. \u201cAlthough we are starting again in the UK, we have a number of advantages over a typical startup. We are nimble and efficient, but with a great brand, strong customer base and a proven and dedicated team.\u201d Most of the 84-strong workforce is made up of former BHS workers, and Anderson said he hoped to employ more people once the business was established. \u201cNearly everybody has worked with us before. We\u2019re trying to create jobs. We\u2019ve got to make sure what we\u2019re building is on strong foundations: we\u2019re not going to rush into this. As we grow, I do want to be able to recruit more people, especially former BHS workers.\u201d Prices will be \u201cthe same or lower\u201d than they were previously according to Anderson, who said there would be fewer promotions in the future. \u201cThere will be the odd promotion, but not the spectaculars and mega days that the old business used to do,\u201d he said. Anderson said BHS clothing was previously targeted at customers aged 45 or older, whereas its new ranges would be aimed at those aged 35 and older. He said the clothing ranges were all newly selected, with a focus on collections and \u201ca lot more style\u201d. The new website has also been started from scratch. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be much cleaner and uncluttered,\u201d Andersen said. Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst, said BHS was making a comeback at a challenging time for the UK retail industry. \u201cThe UK market is entering the most turbulent, challenging moment in its history. A major determinant of success in this market will be how retailers deal with change \u2013 simply doing things in the old way won\u2019t work any more. \u201cBHS International knows it has to focus only on those parts of the old BHS that worked, and to edit and reposition the product offering. The market emerging will be tough but BHS has been able to choose the cards it holds going forward, and that will be a key advantage it can leverage.\u201d Anderson joined BHS from Marks &amp; Spencer in 2009 as a regional manager, before being appointed retail and marketing director and then international director. The last 22 BHS stores closed at the end of August, bringing the curtain down the retailer\u2019s 88-year history, which began with a store in Brixton, south London. While all of the shops have closed, the issue over the huge pension deficit has yet to be resolved. Sir Philip Green, who sold BHS for \u00a31 little more than a year before the retailer went bust, said earlier this month that he was working on a solution \u201con a daily basis\u201d for the company\u2019s 20,000 pensioners. However, MPs investigating the collapse of the retailer \u2013 which Green had sold to Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt with no retail experience \u2013 have expressed frustration at the lack of progress. Despite BHS\u2019s struggles, the international and online divisions were considered the best-performing parts of the retailer, and were still profitable when the department store chain collapsed. The relaunched business has not inherited the pension liabilities of the former group. As well as Anderson, the Al Mana Group retained Sara Bradley, buying director, and Dave West, head of creative, from the former business.",

    "webTitle": "Like Ed Balls, Jeremy Corbyn is struggling to impress the judges", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When polling stations closed at 10pm on the night of 7 May 2015, the bookies would have given generous odds on Ed Balls doing the waltz on Strictly Come Dancing and Jeremy Corbyn leading the Labour party less than 18 months later. Had things turned out a little differently, Balls would now be running the Treasury and Corbyn would have remained a backbench MP. Ed Miliband would have been at the head of a coalition government and there would have been no EU referendum. In the intervening period, Corbyn has won not one but two leadership contests, both by thumping majorities. His opponents in the party have been routed and he now has the job of getting Labour ready to fight the next election. That will be no easy task. Three months ago, the notion that the Conservative party would hold a double-digit opinion poll lead over the Labour party looked remote. David Cameron had just resigned after calling and losing the Brexit referendum and there were fears of a summer of financial and political chaos while the Tories chose a new prime minister. Labour had its problems but they appeared to be minor by comparison. The mood has now changed. Theresa May is enjoying a honeymoon period and political pundits assume that she will trounce Corbyn whenever she chooses to go to the country, whether that is at a snap election next spring or if the current parliament is allowed to run its full five-year course. The conventional wisdom is that Britain is facing another prolonged period of uninterrupted Conservative rule. But honeymoons - as Gordon Brown can testify - come to an end. Labour\u2019s last prime minister looked the part and had an assured start when he took over from Tony Blair in the summer of 2007. Then the financial crisis broke, there were queues outside Northern Rock branches and it was never the same again. May\u2019s honeymoon could turn out to be similarly brief. While the risk of an immediate recession has receded, it is possible that the government will make a hash of the Brexit negotiations when they eventually start. Before that, though, there is the possibility that the supposed cure for the last recession unwittingly creates the conditions for another painful downturn. This is what is happening. Interest rates are low everywhere and have been for years. The Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank are still upping the amount of stimulus they are providing, even though it is almost a decade since the sub-prime mortgage crisis erupted in the summer of 2007. The only major central bank that is even thinking about tightening policy is the US Federal Reserve. The Fed took the first tentative step towards the \u201cnormalisation\u201d of interest rates (around 5% was the pre-crisis norm) last December and sent out signals that the cost of borrowing would be pushed up several times during 2016. Since then, though, the Fed has sat tight even though unemployment is low and consumer spending is strong. With negligible wage pressure and last year\u2019s fall in the cost of energy holding inflation down, the Fed has said it wants to see further evidence that the economy is strengthening before moving again. Wall Street has taken that as a strong hint to be prepared for a December rate rise although, on past form, it won\u2019t take much for the Fed to again decide to leave policy unchanged. In theory, the ability to borrow for the long term at ultra-low rates should be providing an incentive for US businesses to invest. That, though, is not what is happening. Rather than invest, corporations are borrowing money in order to buy back their own shares. This makes sense because, as Charles Dumas of Lombard Street Research has pointed out, the cost of money is below the yield on stocks. But it also means the Fed has created the perfect conditions for a massive stock market bubble, which will pop the moment that interest rates start to rise. The US, courtesy of the dearth of investment, has weak productivity and inflation will start to pick up once growth accelerates to much more than 2%. The fear of the majority of the Fed\u2019s policymakers is that an over-hasty move would send share prices sharply lower, leading to slower growth, higher unemployment and an undershoot of its inflation target. But delay means that the stock market bubble continues to inflate and that the bust \u2013 when it comes \u2013 will be even more severe. It is easy enough to envisage circumstances in which a panic on Wall Street leads to the second global recession in a decade. What would this mean for UK politics? Labour had two problems during the 2007-09 crash. The first was that it was in power when the banks nearly went bust. The second was that it was ill-prepared ideologically to challenge the basis upon which the global economy had been run for the previous 30 years. New Labour had bought into the idea that there was precious little governments could, or even should, do to tame the power of global finance. Clearly, Corbyn doesn\u2019t have the first of these problems. If there is another financial crisis, it is going to happen on May\u2019s watch. The more interesting question is whether Labour could respond to a fresh crisis with an economic programme that is intellectually coherent and politically attractive. This is a tall order. Labour does not tend to win power when times are tough; rather it wins during periods when the mood is optimistic and when the economy is strong, as in 1964 and 1997. In 1945, it was impossible to portray Labour\u2019s economic platform as dangerously radical, since state control of key industries had been necessary to win the war. The UK has the same economic weakness as the US: private investment has been too low even with interest rates at record lows. Corbyn\u2019s answer is higher public spending channeled through a national investment bank. There is nothing wrong with this. Indeed, it makes a lot of sense to remedy the UK\u2019s infrastructure deficiencies when borrowing is so cheap. Likewise, an idea that Corbyn floated in the 2015 leadership race - People\u2019s quantitative easing - would provide a useful policy weapon in the event of another severe financial crisis. There is little scope for central banks to cut interest rates further and the current QE programmes have encouraged speculation rather than investment. People\u2019s QE is a form of helicopter money: public investment financed by money creation by the Bank of England. But Labour has done little to turn higher borrowing or People\u2019s QE into mainstream ideas and is failing to counter the perception that it knows more about spending money than creating wealth. In that respect, Corbyn and Balls are alike: both are struggling to impress the judges.",

      "body": "<p>When polling stations closed at 10pm on the night of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2015\">7 May 2015,</a> the bookies would have given generous odds on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/24/ed-balls-waltz-strictly-come-dancing-bbc\">Ed Balls doing the waltz on Strictly Come Dancing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn leading the Labour party</a> less than 18 months later.</p> <p>Had things turned out a little differently, Balls would now be running the Treasury and Corbyn would have remained a backbench MP. Ed Miliband would have been at the head of a coalition government and there would have been no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">EU referendum.</a></p> <p>In the intervening period, Corbyn has won not one but two leadership contests, both by thumping majorities. His opponents in the party have been routed and he now has the job of getting Labour ready to fight the next election. That will be no easy task.</p> <p>Three months ago, the notion that the Conservative party would hold a double-digit opinion poll lead over the Labour party looked remote. David Cameron had just resigned after calling and losing the Brexit referendum and there were fears of a summer of financial and political chaos while the Tories chose a new prime minister. Labour had its problems but they appeared to be minor by comparison.</p> <p>The mood has now changed. Theresa May is enjoying a honeymoon period and political pundits assume that she will trounce Corbyn whenever she chooses to go to the country, whether that is at a snap election next spring or if the current parliament is allowed to run its full five-year course. The conventional wisdom is that Britain is facing another prolonged period of uninterrupted Conservative rule.</p> <p>But honeymoons - as Gordon Brown can testify - come to an end. Labour\u2019s last prime minister looked the part and had an assured start when he took over from Tony Blair in the summer of 2007. Then the financial crisis broke, there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/14/money2\">queues outside Northern Rock branches</a> and it was never the same again.</p> <p>May\u2019s honeymoon could turn out to be similarly brief. While the risk of an immediate recession has receded, it is possible that the government will make a hash of the Brexit negotiations when they eventually start. Before that, though, there is the possibility that the supposed cure for the last recession unwittingly creates the conditions for another painful downturn. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>This is what is happening. Interest rates are low everywhere and have been for years. The Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank are still upping the amount of stimulus they are providing, even though it is almost a decade since the sub-prime mortgage crisis erupted in the summer of 2007.</p> <p>The only major central bank that is even thinking about tightening policy is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">US Federal Reserve</a>. The Fed took the first tentative step towards the \u201cnormalisation\u201d of interest rates (around 5% was the pre-crisis norm) last December and sent out signals that the cost of borrowing would be pushed up several times during 2016.</p> <p>Since then, though, the Fed has sat tight even though unemployment is low and consumer spending is strong. With negligible wage pressure and last year\u2019s fall in the cost of energy holding inflation down, the Fed has said it wants to see further evidence that the economy is strengthening before moving again. Wall Street has taken that as a strong hint to be prepared for a December rate rise although, on past form, it won\u2019t take much for the Fed to again decide to leave policy unchanged.</p> <p>In theory, the ability to borrow for the long term at ultra-low rates should be providing an incentive for US businesses to invest. That, though, is not what is happening. Rather than invest, corporations are borrowing money in order to buy back their own shares. This makes sense because, as Charles Dumas of Lombard Street Research has pointed out, the cost of money is below the yield on stocks.</p> <p>But it also means the Fed has created the perfect conditions for a massive stock market bubble, which will pop the moment that interest rates start to rise. The US, courtesy of the dearth of investment, has weak productivity and inflation will start to pick up once growth accelerates to much more than 2%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"32ffcba001766b07cb1670b6ae581ad9eeeac2c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32ffcba001766b07cb1670b6ae581ad9eeeac2c3/0_0_2208_3500/631.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Balls waltzing on Strictly Come Dancing\" width=\"631\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Balls waltzing on Strictly Come Dancing. Had things turned out differently on 7 May 2015, he would now be running the Treasury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fear of the majority of the Fed\u2019s policymakers is that an over-hasty move would send share prices sharply lower, leading to slower growth, higher unemployment and an undershoot of its inflation target. But delay means that the stock market bubble continues to inflate and that the bust \u2013 when it comes \u2013 will be even more severe. It is easy enough to envisage circumstances in which a panic on Wall Street leads to the second global recession in a decade.</p> <p>What would this mean for UK politics? Labour had two problems during the 2007-09 crash. The first was that it was in power when the banks nearly went bust. The second was that it was ill-prepared ideologically to challenge the basis upon which the global economy had been run for the previous 30 years. New Labour had bought into the idea that there was precious little governments could, or even should, do to tame the power of global finance.</p> <p>Clearly, Corbyn doesn\u2019t have the first of these problems. If there is another financial crisis, it is going to happen on May\u2019s watch. The more interesting question is whether Labour could respond to a fresh crisis with an economic programme that is intellectually coherent and politically attractive.</p> <p>This is a tall order. Labour does not tend to win power when times are tough; rather it wins during periods when the mood is optimistic and when the economy is strong, as in 1964 and 1997. In 1945, it was impossible to portray Labour\u2019s economic platform as dangerously radical, since state control of key industries had been necessary to win the war.</p> <p>The UK has the same economic weakness as the US: private investment has been too low even with interest rates at record lows. Corbyn\u2019s answer is higher public spending channeled through a national investment bank. There is nothing wrong with this. Indeed, it makes a lot of sense to remedy the UK\u2019s infrastructure deficiencies when borrowing is so cheap.</p> <p>Likewise, an idea that Corbyn floated in the 2015 leadership race - People\u2019s quantitative easing - would provide a useful policy weapon in the event of another severe financial crisis. There is little scope for central banks to cut interest rates further and the current QE programmes have encouraged speculation rather than investment. People\u2019s QE is a form of helicopter money: public investment financed by money creation by the Bank of England.</p> <p>But Labour has done little to turn higher borrowing or People\u2019s QE into mainstream ideas and is failing to counter the perception that it knows more about spending money than creating wealth. In that respect, Corbyn and Balls are alike: both are struggling to impress the judges. </p>",

      "bodyText": "AkzoNobel, one of Europe\u2019s biggest industrial companies, has called for \u201cquick clarity\u201d over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU. Ton B\u00fcchner, the chief executive of the company, which makes Dulux paint and employs 45,000 people, said staff had sought reassurances about the company\u2019s future in the UK but that he was committed to its existing investments. AkzoNobel employs 3,500 people in the UK across several factories and research and development sites. B\u00fcchner said it was too early to comment on whether the referendum result would affect future decisions about where to invest but that the company would deal with Brexit. B\u00fcchner said: \u201cAs a CEO, what you prefer in situations like this is quick clarity, quick stability so everybody knows the rules, everybody can adapt to the situation on the ground. \u201cAs long as the situation on the ground is unclear people don\u2019t know exactly whether big decisions are going to be right or wrong, so you get postponements [of decisions]. So for us that could be with our customers and it could be with our suppliers.\u201d He added that he respected the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU but was keen for it to remain part of the single market. \u201cWe have always said that we will respect any decision that the British people take because that is their decision to take,\u201d said B\u00fcchner, who is Dutch. \u201cBut we have always said that we would have preferred that the UK remained part of the EU. That hasn\u2019t changed. \u201cAt the moment I guess there is a lot of question marks about what the arrangement will look like. [The single market] would have been one of the reasons why our desire was to remain part of the EU \u2013 to have that free flow of people, goods and services that has benefited the EU so much.\u201d B\u00fcchner said the impact of the vote remained unclear. The weakening of the pound could be beneficial for the company because while most of the Dulux paint it sells in the UK is made there, it exports performance coatings that are used to cover ships, buildings, cans and mobile devices. He added: \u201cLook at AkzoNobel and look specifically at the UK \u2013 we have unbelievably strong brands, we have fantastic market position, we have a great set of people, and we have got several research and development labs in the country that support developments outside. The strength and built-in agility that we have make some confident to say that whatever comes in our direction, we will deal with it.\u201d Despite B\u00fcchner\u2019s confidence, AkzoNobel staff in the UK have expressed concern about the company\u2019s approach after the referendum. \u201cThey have asked us questions and we have clearly told them we are committed to the UK business, we are committed to the UK investments that we have decided upon,\u201d B\u00fcchner said. \u201cWe are committed to continue to innovate here, with our research and development centres, and we are committed to the Dulux Academy that we have started up here to make sure that the demand for painters is filled. \u201cWe have signalled very clear commitments to the UK and that will continue to be the case. With that, our employees know they have a stable and solid employer. We have such fantastic brands over here, we have great positions, so it is only logical that we are totally committed to the UK.\u201d AkzoNobel, which is worth more than \u20ac15bn (\u00a312.9bn), is also pressing ahead with a new factory in Ashington, Northumberland. B\u00fcchner explained: \u201cInvestments are basically judged on their business merits, what the market is like, how the market will develop, what the products are that we manufacture, and what raw materials we have to import or can get locally. \u201cFor all of these it is simply too early to tell. A lot of people are speculating, are doing scenario planning, and that is all nice. But at the moment we are committed to what we are doing over here.\u201d With Britain yet to activate article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, which starts the formal process of negotiating an exit from the EU, European politicians and business leaders have been talking about the potential to shift jobs across the Channel. The mayor of Frankfurt visited the City of London last week, promoting the German city as a place for financial service firms to do business. \u201cI think at the moment there is a little bit of opportunism going on, where people let balloons go up to see what the responses are,\u201d Buchner said. \u201cI think the smart thing to do is to stay calm, do not speculate and just let the politicians do their job. As I said, hopefully they do it quickly. That is my desire. Quick, clear, no nonsense, and just move on with life.\u201d AkzoNobel\u2019s research and development teams are producing groundbreaking innovations, including an environmentally friendly coating for ships, which allows the owners to save energy and trade carbon credits. They are also working on a new coating for wine-bottle corks, which makes them easier to insert and improves the seal. \u201cWe have a tremendous amount of innovations in the system,\u201d B\u00fcchner said. \u201cThe functionality of paint beside the beauty and the colour is something that we keep pushing the boundaries on \u2013 whether it is anti-mosquito, whether it is antibacterial, whether it is reflective paints, whether it is paints that in some fashion have an increased insulation.\u201d This article was amended on 27 September 2016.

    "webTitle": "Brussels must fight and beat McDonald\u2019s in the battle for tax justice", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Speculation is rife in Brussels that the European commission is strapping on its boxing gloves in preparation for another battle over corporate tax avoidance. In the red corner is Luxembourg\u2019s finance ministry, which has spent the last year under investigation for allegedly setting up sweetheart deals for allowed McDonald\u2019s to receive \u20ac1bn from its European operations tax-free. At the same time, Ireland is preparing to defend its treatment of Apple after being pummelled by a commission report that accused the US mobile phone maker of avoiding \u20ac13bn in corporate taxes. Dublin aims to persuade the European Court of Justice that all the tax breaks it offered were fair and reasonable or, if not, then at any event in the gift of a sovereign national government. It all adds up to a busy time for competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager. She has landed a few punches as part of a Brussels mission to stop corporate taxes going into the dustbin of history. If her officials have pieced together a watertight case against McDonald\u2019s, it will send a strong message to the legions of US companies based in Ireland or the Grand Duchy that tax is not optional. McDonald\u2019s, it should be said, denies any wrongdoing, while Luxembourg said the fast food group had not received preferential treatment. Without a crackdown on the biggest avoiders, the current system of taxing corporations risks becoming a bad joke. Only last week, the rich nations\u2019 thinktank, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said eight of the top industrialised nations had cut corporation tax rates last year or said cuts were imminent. The Paris-based organisation named Japan, Spain, Israel, Norway and Estonia as culprits. Future reductions are planned by Italy, France, the UK and Japan. The OECD avoided using the phrase \u201crace to the bottom\u201d, but characterised the downward trend as having accelerated since the 2008 banking crisis. \u201cWith regard to corporate income tax, rate reductions had generally slowed down after the crisis but seem to be picking up again,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe trend seems to be gaining renewed momentum.\u201d A combination of lower headline tax rates and generous tax breaks has proved to be the formula of choice for many countries desperate to attract foreign investment. In a bid to shore up their depleted exchequers, the OECD suggested cuts in corporation tax were being partially offset by rises in other taxes such as VAT, fuel and car tax. But as tax justice and inequality campaigners have shown, higher taxes on personal incomes and essential items hits poorer individuals hardest. The Tax Justice Network summed up the problem when it said this remedy for lost corporate taxes \u201credistributes wealth upwards\u201d. It added: \u201cGovernments make up shortfalls [from corporation tax cuts] by levying higher taxes on other, less wealthy sections of society, or by cutting back on essential public services, so tax \u2018competition\u2019 boosts inequality and deprivation.\u201d Strangely, the US government is one of the few to stand out against the trend and maintain its high corporation tax rate. At 35% for major corporations and 40% once local taxes are taken into account, its main rate is double the UK\u2019s 20%. But the only reason the rate has not come down yet is the gridlock on Capitol Hill, with senators, representatives and the White House at each other\u2019s throats. Barack Obama can see that everyone else is at it, and it would be a big part of a Donald Trump\u2019s war on tax. Which makes the McDonald\u2019s case so crucial. If Luxembourg and Ireland are both successfully prosecuted, EU citizens might feel better about paying tax. All governments underestimate voters\u2019 resentment that corporations pay almost nothing. Will RBS\u2019s new image make a difference? You be the judge X Factor contestants are fond of telling the judges that they \u201creally want it\u201d as they wait for Simon Cowell and his fellow judges to decide whether to say \u201cyes\u201d. This weekend, the talent contest should be essential viewing for Philip Hammond, because Royal Bank of Scotland will be rolling out a new publicity campaign during the show\u2019s ad breaks intended to signal a break from the near-fatal era of Fred Goodwin. Ross McEwan will be hoping that he gets a yes from Hammond for the strategy he has adopted: to abandon global ambition and focus on high streets in the UK and Ireland. The new chancellor\u2019s intentions for the government\u2019s 73% stake in RBS have not been made public since he stepped into No 11 to replace George Osborne in the wake of a Brexit vote that has piled even further pain on RBS. The lower-for-longer interest rate environment is not helpful for a bank that has racked up losses of more than \u00a350bn since its bailout and is on course for at least two more years in the mire. Osborne had signalled his determination to return the bank to private hands by taking a \u00a31bn loss on the first sell-down of the government\u2019s stake last summer. Those shares were sold at 300p \u2013 below the 502p break-even point for taxpayers, but way above the 180p to which they have now sunk. For now, at least, McEwan can tell Hammond that he is not to blame for problems he faces: the footdragging of the US authorities over a fine \u2013 which could amount to \u00a39bn \u2013 for the way it sold mortgage bonds before the crisis, and the delays at UK regulators over an investigation into the way it treated, or mistreated, small business customers. McEwan will also argue that the delay selling the 300 branches that the EU demanded as a penalty for its bailout cannot be helped. The post-referendum rate cut ended all hope that Williams &amp; Glyn could be reborn as a standalone bank. The New Zealander made sure his strategy got the approval of Osborne. He will be hoping it is enough for a yes from Hammond. Ignore Lawson\u2019s bluster over Brexit: Carney must stay Attacks on Bank of England governor Mark Carney are nothing new. But the volume has risen recently, especially after he defended his warnings of doom and gloom should the UK vote for Brexit. Lord Lawson has called for him to quit, saying he \u201cbehaved disgracefully\u201d in the run-up to the EU referendum. He said: \u201cI have known all six of his predecessors as governor of the Bank of England and not one of them would have thought it proper to behave as he has done, particularly during the campaign when he joined in the chorus of scaremongering.\u201d Lawson\u2019s anger might turn to apoplexy it the rumours are true that Carney will stay three years beyond the end of his term in 2018. But the public will cheer. Carney has shown himself to be calm in a crisis, cutting interest rates when needed in the weeks after the vote. Lawson should pipe down.",

Dublin aims to persuade the European Court of Justice that all the tax breaks it offered were fair and reasonable or, if not, then at any event in the gift of a sovereign national government.</p> <p>It all adds up to a busy time for competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager. She has landed a few punches as part of a Brussels mission to stop corporate taxes going into the dustbin of history.</p> <p>If her officials have pieced together a watertight case against McDonald\u2019s, it will send a strong message to the legions of US companies based in Ireland or the Grand Duchy that tax is not optional. McDonald\u2019s, it should be said, denies any wrongdoing, while Luxembourg said the fast food group had not received preferential treatment.</p> <p>Without a crackdown on the biggest avoiders, the current system of taxing corporations risks becoming a bad joke.</p> <p>Only last week, the rich nations\u2019 thinktank, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/22/corporation-tax-downward-trend-oecd-gdp-growth\" title=\"\">eight of the top industrialised nations had cut corporation tax rates</a> last year or said cuts were imminent.

Future reductions are planned by Italy, France, the UK and Japan.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/oecd\" title=\"\">OECD</a> avoided using the phrase \u201crace to the bottom\u201d, but characterised the downward trend as having accelerated since the 2008 banking crisis. \u201cWith regard to corporate income tax, rate reductions had generally slowed down after the crisis but seem to be picking up again,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe trend seems to be gaining renewed momentum.\u201d</p> <p>A combination of lower headline tax rates and generous tax breaks has proved to be the formula of choice for many countries desperate to attract foreign investment. In a bid to shore up their depleted exchequers, the OECD suggested cuts in corporation tax were being partially offset by rises in other taxes such as VAT, fuel and car tax.</p> <p>But as tax justice and inequality campaigners have shown, higher taxes on personal incomes and essential items hits poorer individuals hardest.</p> <p>The Tax Justice Network summed up the problem when it said this remedy for lost corporate taxes \u201credistributes wealth upwards\u201d.</p> <p>It added: \u201cGovernments make up shortfalls [from corporation tax cuts] by levying higher taxes on other, less wealthy sections of society, or by cutting back on essential public services, so tax \u2018competition\u2019 boosts inequality and deprivation.\u201d</p> <p>Strangely, the US government is one of the few to stand out against the trend and maintain its high corporation tax rate. <a href=\"https://home.kpmg.com/xx/en/home/services/tax/tax-tools-and-resources/tax-rates-online/corporate-tax-rates-table.html\" title=\"\">At 35% for major corporations and 40% once local taxes are taken into account</a>, its main rate is double the UK\u2019s 20%.

Labour finance chief John McDonnell might see the sense in boosting the amount spent on roads, rail, fibre-optic cabling, skills training and green energy. Paris-based thinktank the OECD is in the same camp, along with the International Monetary Fund; they have both urged the government to push ahead with plans already on the drawing board. And lined up end to end, economists in favour of infrastructure spending would stretch to the moon and back. But the Treasury has held firm. Austerity was a vote-winner in the last election and will be so again in 2020. It\u2019s something Jim O\u2019Neill discovered in his time as a treasury minister and it appears to be one of the main reasons the former Goldman Sachs economist resigned on Friday. There is no money for the northern powerhouse \u2013 not unless it is recycled from elsewhere. Long gone are the days when Gordon Brown could slap a penny on national insurance and get a cheer when he promised to spend it on the NHS. Respondents to Ipsos Mori surveys show the health service dividend is largely spent, leaving voters split three ways in their views on what do about meeting growing demand. A third say the answer is rationing, by which they mean excluding smokers and other groups from some treatments. A third say extra funds should come from efficiency savings. Only a final third support extra taxes. Ipsos Mori polling shows that there are some discrete areas of spending that voters will sanction, in particular on housing. But this support is offset by a clear drift towards nimbyism that divides the pro-investment group from the anti and can be seen in planning disputes across the country. It is in this context that the Treasury under George Osborne, and now Philip Hammond, has remained firmly of the view that there is little public appetite for multibillion-pound projects funded by either higher taxation or with borrowed money that might push the national debt higher. And the pressure on Hammond to keep a tight rein will only have intensified ahead of the autumn statement, after public debt figures for August showed government borrowing heading for a bigger deficit than planned. Not that ministers are immune to extra spending because they have an in-built ideological resistance to it, though some on the free-market fringes of the Tory party do. They resist the temptation to give the go-ahead because a public majority backs low taxation and bare-bones services. Crucially, people across the political spectrum have swallowed a line about extra spending being a burden on the young, which makes every protest at borrowing to build new schools and hospitals feel virtuous. Higher borrowing now is not paid by today\u2019s taxpayers, but tomorrow\u2019s, they say. Comments last year by the new trade minister, Liam Fox, sum up the sentiment: \u201cWe must continue and, if possible, accelerate fiscal consolidation. It is quite unacceptable that the debts of a more affluent generation should be landed on a less affluent one.\u201d This phrase was repeated by countless ministers, having had its origins in what was regarded as the most effective poster used by the Tory party at the 2010 election. It depicted a newborn baby under the headline: \u201cDad\u2019s nose, Mum\u2019s eyes, Gordon Brown\u2019s debts.\u201d Earlier this year, Osborne was still pushing the same buttons, hailing his March budget as \u201cputting the next generation first\u201d, before outlining another \u00a312bn of welfare cuts and the target of a budget surplus in 2020. These are arguments that must be confronted. Not that it will be easy; the worse than expected finances will restrict Hammond\u2019s room for manoeuvre. Nevertheless, telling well-off baby boomers that constructing sophisticated infrastructure at the earliest opportunity provides young people with jobs, better health outcomes and a better standard of living is essential. Delaying the same infrastructure spending until such time as the government has a surplus is only to punish the young, leaving them to play catch-up with other countries\u2019 industrial, digital and healthcare investments. When Larry Fink, the chief executive and chairman of the world\u2019s largest fund manager, BlackRock \u2013 it manages $4.4tn of investments \u2013 says that chief executives on both sides of the Atlantic tell him there is no reason to invest at the moment, you know the private sector will not be the answer. Labour\u2019s answer is, in part, to tax. But there is no appetite for paying higher taxes either. That leaves borrowing, which is not such a scary prospect when international investors are prepared to lend money at rock-bottom rates. It can look like a gamble to borrow to build a road, cycleway, train link or skills academy that provides secondary effects for the private sector. But when the effective interest rate is below 1%, the economy only needs to grow modestly on the back of these developments to make the borrowing pay for itself. McDonnell proposes a \u00a3500bn national investment bank. What he fails to recognise is that the argument is still in the proverbial basement, waiting to emerge on the ground floor. As such, he hasn\u2019t even made the case for government to regain control before he\u2019s blown \u00a3500bn.
