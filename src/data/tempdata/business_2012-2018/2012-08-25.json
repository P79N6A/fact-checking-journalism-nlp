So went the gag on the estimable Popbitch website over the summer, as the gaffe-prone group humiliated itself yet again \u2013 this time over its Olympic security contract. To be scrupulously fair, Popbitch was being rather cruel: writing G4S jokes is quite obviously the company's domain, so it will now need to reassert its dominance in the field this week when it unveils its half-year results. All the talk during the presentation will predictably surround how the Olympic debacle impacts the company's reputation and finances \u2013 and while Panmure Gordon analysts reckon the shares are \"finely poised\", the same is unlikely to be said of embattled boss Nick Buckles.

The Vedanta meeting will come to order One wonders if Anil Agarwal, chairman of the mining group Vedanta Resources, has considered hiring the Olympic stadium for his company's annual meeting this week, rather than squeezing his board, investors and an army of protesters and placards into less spacious facilities in town. In what promises to be the FTSE 100 miner's latest sell-out, campaign groups such as Amnesty, Survival and Foil Vedanta (to name just a few) will be highlighting a range of grievances including alleged pollution, poor safety and persistent efforts to mine bauxite in India's Niyamgiri hills, which are considered sacred by an ancient tribe.

There haven't been a lot, but it is remarkable how so many, at the height of their powers, shared a peculiarly autocratic style, able to switch in a split second between charm offensive and ruthless tirade. Michael Bright, founder of Independent Insurance, Carl Cushnie, founder of Versailles Group, and Stephen Hinchliffe, founder of shoe shop group Facia, were all rock stars of the corporate world who made millions upon millions for their shareholders.

Only belatedly has the government thrown the SFO a modest, one-off budget increase of \u00a33m to conduct an investigation into the Libor-fixing scandal.

This would help tax authorities to detect the dodgy accounting that shifts profits out of the countries where they are made and into tax havens.

    "webTitle": "Libya's promised reconstruction bonanza fails to materialise", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Regatta is a large gated compound set aside for foreign business executives on the coast west of Tripoli. Most of its homes lie empty, many ransacked by militias, and sand blown in from the seafront forms little dunes on its roads. It wasn't meant to be like this. It is now a year since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi's dictatorship, which triggered seemingly endless predictions by the likes of UK defence secretary Philip Hammond that British executives would be \"packing their suitcases\" to share in a reconstruction bonanza. Yet Regatta stubbornly refuses to become anything but a ghost town \u2013 if not a laboured symbol for the state of Libya's business life. \"Nobody is coming back here: it's not safe,\" admits one of the compound's few residents, a German engineer. Those foreign companies that are again operating skeleton staffs say their executives refuse to bring their families. In April, the UK's ambassador to Libya, Sir Dominic Asquith, addressed a delegation of the Libyan British Business Council (LBBC) in Tripoli. The trade body reported to members that he \"spoke vehemently of his surprise and disappointment at British firms' slow response to the business opportunities\". Then in May, UK-listed oil giant Shell added to the sense of disengagement when it said it was abandoning its wells and stopping exploration in Libya. Meanwhile, pumps supplier Weir Group has so far refused to return to Libya \u2013 it had been working on a multimillion-pound power plant refurbishment in Misrata. Oil services firm Wood Group, which last week revealed it had just received a payment of $5.8m (\u00a33.7m) from the new Libyan government for work performed for the previous regime, is also cautious: \"The pattern to look at [to predict how Libya will develop] is Iraq. There was a great deal of discussion about the potential there, but it is only now that people are starting to get engaged.\" However, the LBBC is slightly more positive when addressing the wider world. Director general Robin Lamb insists British firms are keeping their end up: \"Someone said 'where are the Brits?', but we're not lagging behind. There are three branches of Next, branches of BHS, Topshop, M&amp;S\u2026\" Among other hopeful signs is the return of BP \u2013 which announced a deal to explore for Libyan oil in 2007 only to withdraw during the Arab spring. \"We are preparing to pick up our exploration programme where we left off in early 2011 and we've started assigning contracts,\" says a spokesman. \"It will take time to rebuild our capabilities and we don't expect any drilling to start until next year.\" Elsewhere, Heritage Oil, a FTSE-250 prospector, has long-term permits and licences to supply the country's oilfields after acquiring a 51% share in oil services group Sahara in October. \"Sahara is active but so far has not generated any revenues,\" the company says. \"We are working on various tenders and have held discussions with senior members of government and state oil companies.\" Still, none of these projects currently looks like forming part of the bonanza envisaged 12 months ago. So why is the reconstruction taking so long? Security remains a problem: two car bombs earlier this month in Tripoli set nerves on edge. Tribal fighting also continues in towns to the south, and western diplomatic missions have been attacked in Benghazi, Libya's second city. \"A string of assassinations, mainly of individuals linked to the Gaddafi regime, and attacks on western targets have sent a worrying message,\" says Jonathan Terry of risk consultancy Maplecroft. \"Libyan officials have repeatedly said that companies from countries such as Britain, France and the US who supported the intervention would be 'rewarded', but the extent to which this promise will be upheld has yet to be seen.\" For many, the slow progress is down to westerners not understanding the pace at which Libya works. One seasoned middle-eastern oil executive says: \"The [Libyan] National Transition Council was very careful not to say it was going to give any long-term contracts until after a democratically elected government was formed. There was never going to be this rush for contracts.\" Elections took place in July, and though they passed off peacefully, a new cabinet has yet to be formed. \"It's taken a while for the Libyan government to get organised,\" says Maryann Maguire of UK-based consultancy InterCultures. Nowhere illustrates the stagnation better than Tripoli's stock market. In a country supposedly hungry for reconstruction, financial traders should be rushed off their feet. Instead, they spend their days staring at chains of orange zeroes on big wall-mounted screens. Brokers say the government, staffed by officials of the former dictatorship, is not equipped to make the transition to a free market. Stock market trading director Mohammed Salabi has a series of bulky files containing a model regulatory law drafted by his own officials and drawing on experience in bourses in London, Paris and New York. Even now, he claims, the administration has made no move to implement his regulations which, he says, would give investors confidence to buy shares. \"The economics minister still does not understand the importance of the Libyan stock market,\" he says. \"We made the regulations\u2026 We cook the food, we make the dish, we give the fork and the knife and ask him please, just eat it.\" Yet other foreign firms are beginning to tuck in. France's Nexans was recently awarded an \u00a380m electric cable contract, and Germany's Wintershall has begun work on a major new oil pipeline. \"France, Italy, Turkey and Germany have a completely different culture to doing business,\" says InterCultures' Maguire. \"British business culture is more reserved.\" Some nationalities have definitely demonstrated more corporate aggression in Libya, though it remains to be seen how effective these strategies will be. Hans Meier-Ewert of the German-African Business Association made his first visit during the war, flying in five tonnes of medical aid and a plane-load of executives while fighting still raged. \"We want to be the early bird,\" he says. \"It's not important to have the deals immediately; its important we go and see them.\" Apart from British reserve, other more tangible barriers to Britain's business remain. A regular complaint from companies is the line taken by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which counsels against \"all but essential travel\" to Libya. This bumps up insurance costs and puts firms off making the trip. Still, the LBBC's Lamb is optimistic, arguing that the bonanza is delayed, not abandoned. He hopes the new government will speed reform: \"Our own advice is that going to Libya for business purposes is now 'essential',\" he says. The sales pitch certainly sounds alluring. After 40 years of idiosyncratic dictatorship, Libya's six million people are hungry for everything from roads and hospitals to phones and fashion. The country has no railway and no public bus service. UK Trade and Investment estimates Libya will eventually spend more than \u00a3125bn on reconstruction. \"Libya is virgin land: any business coming here will be a success,\" says Ehab Abdelo-Meged, manager of a branch of the US bakery chain Cinnabon \u2013 the sole foreign-owned fast food franchise to open in Tripoli in 12 months. \"Look at retail. All the guys here buy their clothes from aboard. Why would they go abroad if they could buy them here?\" If they could, no doubt they would. But sceptics wonder for how long fashion-conscious Libyans will have to \u2013 literally \u2013 embark on shopping trips, while others worry that the bloodshed may still have years to run. \"Nothing will happen [commercially] until things settle down, and that could take years,\" says one expert. \"The Libyans are settling old scores and will probably go through further tribal battles, and possibly civil war.\"",

Most of its homes lie empty, many ransacked by militias, and sand blown in from the seafront forms little dunes on its roads. It wasn't meant to be like this.</p> <p>It is now a year since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi's dictatorship, which triggered seemingly endless predictions by the likes of UK defence secretary Philip Hammond that British executives would be \"packing their suitcases\" to share in a reconstruction bonanza. Yet Regatta stubbornly refuses to become anything but a ghost town \u2013 if not a laboured symbol for the state of Libya's business life.</p> <p>\"Nobody is coming back here: it's not safe,\" admits one of the compound's few residents, a German engineer.

The trade body reported to members that he \"spoke vehemently of his surprise and disappointment at British firms' slow response to the business opportunities\".</p> <p>Then in May, UK-listed oil giant Shell added to the sense of disengagement when it said it was abandoning its wells and stopping exploration in Libya. Meanwhile, pumps supplier Weir Group has so far refused to return to Libya \u2013 it had been working on a multimillion-pound power plant refurbishment in Misrata. Oil services firm Wood Group, which last week revealed it had just received a payment of $5.8m (\u00a33.7m) from the new Libyan government for work performed for the previous regime, is also cautious: \"The pattern to look at [to predict how Libya will develop] is Iraq.

It is not just JLR that has modernised. Mark Fulthorpe, an analyst at IHS Automotive, says the presence of high-class manufacturers such as Toyota, Nissan, Volkswagen and BMW in the UK bodes well for the long term.

      "bodyText": "A decade ago Libya was at the centre of dramatic stories alleging cloak-and-dagger diplomacy between then-BP boss Lord Browne, Colonel Gaddafi and MI6 agents. And barely 12 months ago British warplanes were in action over Tripoli \u2013 this time fighting to topple the North African dictator former prime minister Tony Blair had previously decided to embrace. But if these two events were seen by critics as the UK manoeuvring for an \"oil boom\" that would benefit both countries and an energy-hungry Blighty economy, it must be deemed a bit of a failure. Libya is indeed once again pumping out 1.5m barrels a day of very high-quality crude, a small amount of which is no doubt coming to UK refineries, but neither BP nor Shell is playing any role in that output. In fact it is American, Italian and even German companies that have been brought in by the new government in Tripoli to help it get back to business in double-quick time. Libya has an estimated 47bn barrels of proven oil reserves and while that looks small compared with, say, Saudi Arabia's 265bn, it is a lot more than Britain can lay claim to (less than 3bn). The light \"sweet\" crude from Libya is not only very high quality, it can also easily be extracted from shallow wells in desert areas at a cost that some put as low as $2 a barrel \u2013 not bad if you can sell for $114 on the global market. Five years ago, BP finally signed a Libyan deal worth $900m \u2013 its first in the country since Gaddafi nationalised all petroleum operations and threw out western businesses in 1974. But the exploration explosion by BP, Shell and others who subsequently re-entered the country never properly got under way: the Arab spring brought operations in Libya to a chaotic standstill 18 months ago. BP had 40 expatriate staffers in Libya before the civil war and as yet none has returned full-time. The 100 staff that had been taken on pre-2011 were kept on the payroll, even when they were unable, due to the unrest, to enter their offices. Now the odd BP expat is back making visits to Libya and there are hopes that exploration efforts in the Libyan desert and offshore in the Sirte Basin can restart. While the company says it is optimistic about general prospects, its attitude towards Libya is much less urgent than to the Gulf of Mexico or even Egypt. Shell signed a similar exploration deal in 2008, with a commitment to upgrade and modernise the Marsa al-Brega liquefied natural gas terminal south of Benghazi. But last May it suspended drilling and abandoned exploration in two blocks, citing disappointing results. Shell insists it is keeping an office in Libya and will continue to consider other opportunities but its retreat went down badly with the country's National Oil Corporation. ConocoPhillips of the US, Eni of Italy and Wintershall of Germany are all still plugging away with Libyan oil producers, and energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie believes prospects are good \u2013 for oil, but also for much cleaner gas. The oil business is a fickle one, with Kurdistan and the Arctic current flavours of the month for the oil giants. Despite Libya's credentials as a proven petroleum \"province\" close to European markets, in the absence of a major new discovery this oil-rich desert country remains out in the cold.",

      "bodyText": "Even people with short memories can probably just recall the excited way in which certain commentators and politicians tried to draw hopeful lessons for the British economy from the unexpected (by the very same people) success of the London Olympics. Personally, I shall believe the application of those lessons when I see them. But it is a Bank Holiday weekend, and before we approach what promises to be a dire economic autumn, let us pause for reflection. From time to time over the years I have written about the adventures of the mythical Whitehall mandarin Sir Douglas Corridor in these columns. Sir Douglas had a loyal following, although there were the usual dissenters. Humour is a funny business. Alas, fewer and fewer people seem to connect with that old Whitehall world, and Sir Douglas no longer comes up to town so often. So I thought it was about time to come clean with readers and offer a brief word about his origin. It all began in the 1970s, when three of the most senior officials at the Treasury were called Douglas \u2013 all of them \"Sir\", of course. There was Sir Douglas Allen, Sir Douglas Henley and Sir Douglas Wass. Wass succeeded Allen as permanent secretary to the Treasury, and the two that I got to know particularly well were Sir Douglas Allen (later Lord Croham) and Sir Douglas Wass. There are those who say that the character of Sir Douglas Corridor was based on Sir Douglas Wass: they may think that, but I could not possibly comment. Now, I recently heard a good story about Croham and Wass which I believe is of some interest in demonstrating the importance of a Rolls-Royce civil service machine, run by supremely talented people with minds of their own \u2013 the sort that the present government would like to replace with party hacks. The scene was the early 1970s Conservative government, under prime minister Edward, later Sir Edward, Heath. He used to be known to one and all as Ted, and was sometimes confused with the British big band leader of that name. As readers will be aware, economic policy proceeds in phases in this country. Fashions come; fashions go; fashions return. As part of the perennial battle to control inflation, the Labour governments of Harold Wilson had tried to restrain the rate of growth of incomes; indeed, \"incomes policies\" were considered a weapon in the armoury of economic policymakers. When the Heath government was elected in 1970, with a form of what many observers subsequently thought was \"proto-Thatcherism\", the Conservatives were going through one of their \"market forces are always best\" phases and would have nothing to do with incomes policy. But, hey presto, a couple of years later, inflation was once again becoming a serious problem, unemployment was rising to uncomfortable and embarrassing levels, and things looked pretty grim. As became increasingly obvious in later years, prime minister Heath did not have his heart in the extreme free-market policies he initially espoused during his premiership (I have no record of the views of bandleader Heath in these matters, but my goodness, he led a very good band). It was under Heath's premiership that the metaphor \"U-turn\" was first used to describe a change of policy. Heath called a meeting of ministers and senior civil servants (I seem to recall it was at Chequers) and said he thought that it was time to introduce an incomes policy. He looked directly at Sir Douglas Allen and asked: could the Treasury work on it? Yes, came the answer. Next prime ministerial question: How long would it take? My understanding is that Sir Douglas's reply was something to the effect of \"a week or so\", and that even the notoriously grumpy and impatient Heath was impressed by this. At this stage, dear reader, you will, I am sure, have guessed why this redoubtable Treasury mandarin was able to be so confident in his reply. Long before Heath's U-turn, Allen had called together a few of his officials, led by another Douglas, told them that current policy was bound to end in tears, and asked them to prepare plans for an incomes policy. There was also the episode during Wilson's 1964-70 premiership when the prime minister ordered the destruction of all documents relating to devaluation. But when that eventuality was finally forced upon the government in November 1967, Wilson felt in need of such documents. Luckily, the Rolls-Royce Treasury machine had disobeyed orders and locked them away in a safe. Unluckily, the official who knew the combination code had by then left the Treasury and was working as economics editor for the Times. My old friend Peter Jay duly did the decent thing and gave the Treasury the code \u2013 which was, if I remember correctly, the date of the 1949 devaluation of the pound \u2013 backwards! Well, here we are again, with a government driving itself into a cul-de-sac and needing to conduct a U-turn. Is the civil service ready to oblige? I only ask\u2026",

Long before Heath's U-turn, Allen had called together a few of his officials, led by another Douglas, told them that current policy was bound to end in tears, and asked them to prepare plans for an incomes policy.</p> <p>There was also the episode during Wilson's 1964-70 premiership when the prime minister ordered the destruction of all documents relating to devaluation. But when that eventuality was finally forced upon the government in November 1967, Wilson felt in need of such documents.</p> <p>Luckily, the Rolls-Royce Treasury machine had disobeyed orders and locked them away in a safe. Unluckily, the official who knew the combination code had by then left the Treasury and was working as economics editor for the <em>Times</em>. My old friend Peter Jay duly did the decent thing and gave the Treasury the code \u2013 which was, if I remember correctly, the date of the 1949 devaluation of the pound \u2013 backwards!</p> <p>Well, here we are again, with a government driving itself into a cul-de-sac and needing to conduct a U-turn. Is the civil service ready to oblige? I only&#xa0;ask\u2026</p>",
