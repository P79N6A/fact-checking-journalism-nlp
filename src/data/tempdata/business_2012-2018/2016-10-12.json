      "bodyText": "The fact that the ingredients of Marmite, one of the products at the centre of a price row between Tesco and Unilever, are manufactured in the UK calls into question why the drop in the pound should cause a hike in its price, but its brand power gives the supplier strength in the argument. The global consumer goods company is said to have demanded steep price increases on its products, including Marmite, from the supermarket to offset the higher cost of imported commodities, which are priced in euros and dollars, following the drop in the pound. Tesco retaliated by removing products from its website and warning that if the dispute dragged on, items could disappear from supermarket shelves. However many of the products affected are manufactured in the UK. Marmite, which is one of the products that Tesco is said to be running low on, is exclusively produced in one factory in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire. Marmite, which was invented by German scientist Justus von Liebig in the late 19th century, has been produced in the town since 1902. Although the exact recipe of Marmite is a trade secret, the main ingredients of the spread are manufactured in the UK including yeast extract, vegetable and spices. Burton\u2019s brewing heritage is one of the reasons for the location of the factory, because yeast extract is a waste product in the process of making beer. There were once 30 breweries in the surrounding area but now the raw materials come from across the country. The pound has fallen 17% since Britain voted to leave the EU. Ahead of the referendum, experts warned that Brexit could cause food prices to rise, but this caution was dismissed by leave campaigners as \u201cscaremongering\u201d. On BBC Newsnight on Wednesday night, Christopher Haskins, former chair of Northern Foods \u2013 who supported the remain campaign \u2013 said the dispute was just the beginning of food price rises thanks to Brexit. \u201cWe can expect food inflation of around 5% in 12 months,\u201d he told presenter Emily Maitlis on the show. \u201cWe won\u2019t see Marmite disappear from the shelves and this is why Unilever will win.\u201d People will grumble at the price rise but will still buy it, he added, such is the strength of certain brands. Other popular British brands owned by Unilever \u2013 including Colman\u2019s, Elmlea and Pot Noodle \u2013 are also set to be in short supply at the supermarket chain. Colman\u2019s products, including its famous English mustard, are produced at a factory in Norwich, while Elmlea, the cream alternative made from buttermilk and vegetable oil, is produced at Unilever\u2019s food factory in Purfleet, Essex. Pot Noodles have been produced in Crumlin, south Wales since 1979.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Justifying poor policy often makes politicians say dumb things, and yesterday we saw a classic case by the minister for finance, Senator Mathias Cormann, as he attempted to argue that a tax cut for people earning over $80,000 was necessary to encourage part-time workers make the \u201cadditional effort\u201d to work full-time. The policy to increase the threshold of the 37% income tax bracket from $80,001 to $87,001 is notionally about reducing bracket creep. Bracket creep occurs when due to a wage rise you move into a higher tax bracket. In effect, it is a tax increase by stealth. For example, a person earning $79,000 who got a 2% wage rise to $80,580, goes from paying a marginal tax rate of 32.5% to 37%. But we need a bit of context. They would only be paying 37% tax for the $579 they earned above $80,001, the rest would be unchanged. The tax changes mean that now instead of going into a higher tax bracket, this person would remain with a tax rate of 32.5%. It makes a difference of $26 a year less in tax. The biggest tax cut anyone will get is those who earn over $87,001 \u2013 they will get a cut of $315 a year, or $6 a week. Some economists care about bracket creep because they believe it is a deterrent to work \u2013 in effect you will choose not to work extra hours or cut back on your hours to avoid the higher tax bracket. And as result, workforce participation is reduced. It\u2019s a nice argument, but it works better in theory than in practice. In reality, what studies have found is that people keep working the same amount, they just try to reduce their taxable income by either reducing non-wage income or using new ways to increase their income deductions. But most people don\u2019t earn over $80,000, let alone $87,000. As a result, this measure is greatly targeted to the wealthy. It was on this point that Cormann found himself selling economic snake oil. While debating the legislation yesterday in the Senate, the Greens Senator, Peter Whish-Wilson, asked Cormann who would receive the benefit of the tax. He replied that \u201cthe government is focusing on average full-time wage earners, and no average full-time wage earner will miss out on this tax cut.\u201d Now this is some pretty sneaky use of language. Cormann is right to suggest that \u201cno average full-time wage earner\u201d will miss out. The current average \u201cordinary\u201d full-time earnings is $78,832 \u2013 requiring just a 1.5% increase to get to $80,000 by the end of 2016-17. But the average wage is a very skewed way to look at income. If you have nine people earning $50,000 and one person earning $150,000 then the average earnings of that group is $60,000 even though only one person in the group earns at least that amount. And when talking about \u201caverage full-time workers\u201d things get even more skewed because 63% of all full-time workers are men, and their average wage is much higher than that of women. The current average total full-time earnings for men is $88,223, while for women it is just $71,245. So when Cormann talks of average full-time workers, he is really talking average male full-time workers. And while \u201caverage\u201d sounds like you are talking about someone on middle income, it is actually talking about the top third of wage earners. In 2013-14, when the average annual full-time earnings was $78,972, the median taxable income for men was $62,000, and for women it was just $47,284: In that year, just 35% of men had a taxable income above the average full-time amount, and just 17% of women: So in no way are those earning $80,000 on \u201cmiddle incomes\u201d. But rather than suggest the tax cut was designed to benefit such workers, Cormann yesterday tried to spin it as a marvel of incentives for part-time workers. He argued of the policy that \u201cthe whole purpose is to provide an incentive for part-time workers to work more hours without being penalised with a higher tax rate. That is the whole point\u201d. The whole point. Seriously. He continued by suggesting, \u201cwe want families to be encouraged to stretch themselves to put in an additional effort, but not to be penalised with a higher tax rate as a result\u201d. OK, let\u2019s work this through. Cormann is suggesting \u201cthe whole point\u201d of this tax cut, which is costing $4bn over four years, is to encourage people who are now working part-time to go full-time. He also believes they can do this just by \u201cstretching themselves\u201d. OK then, let us pretend we have a woman working part time and earning $48,000 \u2013 the current average earnings for all women (and thus a very well paid part-time position). If, by some dint of luck and hard work, she was able to get a full-time job that paid $87,000, her after tax income would go from $41,333 to $67,178 \u2013 a 63.3% increase. Cormann would have you believe that because in the past her after-tax income would have gone up by 62.3% to $66,863, that part-time worker would have been less willing to take on the job. Please. The only part-time workers who would in any way be affected by this tax cut are those earning $79,000, and who through working more hours would earn above $80,000. Not exactly a key group in need of assistance. Rather than affecting those already earning close to 40% more than what the median worker in Australia earns, bracket creep is much more of an issue for those on low incomes, who will lose welfare benefits and go above the tax-free threshold. The key issue of labour force participation is about getting people back into the workforce. Does Senator Cormann really believe we have such a problem with part-time workers not taking full-time jobs earning over $80,000 that we need to spend $4bn to solve it? When asked to provide evidence that the tax cut would actually create any incentive for part-time workers, Cormann merely drew attention to Treasury modelling, which provides no modelling whatsoever regarding increased labour participation, let alone a shift from part-time to full-time. But if that is what Cormann argues is the \u201cwhole point\u201d, then that is the basis by which the policy and the government should be judged.",

      "bodyText": "Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive and chairman, John Stumpf, is retiring effective immediately from both the bank and the board in the wake of the scandal over its sales practices. Stumpf \u201cwill not receive any severance payment\u201d, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman confirmed to the Guardian. The bank announced the news on Wednesday after a volatile month for the bank. Early in September, Wells Fargo announced that it had reached a $185m settlement with US regulators for its illegal sales practices. Since 2011 the bank fired more than 5,300 employees for opening more than 2m accounts without customers\u2019 permission. The former employees opened these unauthorized accounts to meet the sales quotas imposed by the company. Since then, Stumpf has testified before both House and Senate and said that the fired employees were not part of an \u201corchestrated effort\u201d. As of 1 October, Wells Fargo has terminated the practice of setting sales quotas in its retail banking. US lawmakers, including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, have called on Stumpf to resign, return his earnings and submit to a criminal investigation. \u201cYou should resign,\u201d Warren told Stumpf last month. \u201cYou should give back the money that you took while this scam was going on, and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\u201d By the end of September, the Wells Fargo board announced that it was launching a new investigation into its retail banking and sales practices. Stumpf was to forgo his salary while the investigation was ongoing; in 2015 he made about $19.3m. Stumpf also forfeited about $41m in unvested equity awards in the aftermath of the scandal. \u201cWhile I have been deeply committed and focused on managing the company through this period, I have decided it is best for the company that I step aside. I know no better individual to lead this company forward than Tim Sloan,\u201d Stumpf said in a statement. Stumpf has been with the company for 34 years and became CEO in June 2007 and chairman in 2010. Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo\u2019s president and chief operating officer, will take over as chief executive. Sloan, who has been with the bank for 29 years, will retain the title of the president. He was also elected to the bank\u2019s board. Stephen Sanger, the Wells Fargo board\u2019s lead director, was elected to serve as the board\u2019s non-executive chairman. When Stumpf testified before the US House of Representatives, lawmakers pressed him on whether he thought it was appropriate for one person to serve as both the chief executive and the chairman. \u201cFor our company, I believe we have the right structure. I serve at the will of the board and the board can make a decision about that,\u201d Stumpf said at the time. He told the lawmakers that he was dedicating all his energy to leading Wells Fargo and that he spent all of his waking hours thinking about it. Within an hour of the announcement, Wells Fargo shares went up up 1.6% in after-hours trading. Wells Fargo is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Friday. Stumpf chose to retire so as not to be a distraction, said Sloan, the new chief executive in an interview with CNBC. When asked if he felt that Stumpf\u2019s departure was a necessary condition in order for the bank to move forward, he said: \u201cJohn did.\u201d He went on to say that the bank will not allow the past five weeks to define it.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s decision not to increase rates in September was a close call, the minutes released on Wednesday show. When the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) met in September, three of the 12 members voted in favor of increasing interest rates as the US labor market continued to improve at a slower rate and the risks from Brexit, the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, eased. Some members indicated that a rate hike might be appropriate \u201crelatively soon\u201d. Up until September, Kansas City Fed president Esther George was the lone voice in favor of raising interest rates. Last month, she was joined by Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester and Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren in her call to increase the target range to 0.50%-0.75%. The current range is 0.25%-0.50%, after it was increased last December for the first time in nearly a decade. The FOMC \u2013 which is the policy setting arm of the US central bank \u2013 noted that the case for increasing interest rates has strengthened recently. After last year\u2019s increase, the Fed was initially expected to hike rates four more times in 2016. With six FOMC meetings having come and gone, that forecast has now been revised down to just one rate hike. The Fed next meets in November, days before the presidential election, and once more in December. Most economists expected the Fed to raise rates again in December, a year since its last hike. Among the reasons for the delay were the continued slack in the labor market and inflation, which continues to run below the FOMC\u2019s 2% objective. According to the FOMC minutes, the majority of its members wanted to wait and see evidence of continued progress before hiking rates. The majority of the members also agreed that the risks from Brexit \u201chad receded\u201d. \u201cHowever, a few still judged that overall risks were weighted to the downside, citing various factors that included the possibility of weaker-than-expected growth in foreign economies, continued uncertainty associated with Brexit, the proximity of policy interest rates to the effective lower bound, or persistent headwinds to economic growth,\u201d according to the minutes. The committee will continue to closely monitor global economic and financial developments. On Tuesday, almost three weeks since the committee\u2019s meeting, the pound recorded its worst four-day performance since the Brexit vote. Those in favor of raising interest rates pointed to continuing job creation. September was the 78th consecutive month of private-sector job growth \u2013 the longest streak of job creation on record. That month the US economy added 156,000 jobs even as the unemployment rate went up to 5%. The higher unemployment rate, however, was good news as it was a result of more people returning to the US labor market. \u201cAs the labor market has improved, people who were discouraged are coming back into the labor force,\u201d said William Dudley, president of New York Fed, on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s allowing us to grow payrolls at a pretty decent clip without pushing down the unemployment rate.\u201d The labor participation rate for September was 62.9%, up from 62.8% a month ago. In September 2008, when Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and the US economy shed 159,000 jobs, the labor participation rate was 66%. As the participation rate has remained near historic lows, the US Department of Labor has pointed out that a contributing factor are the many baby boomers who are leaving the labor market and retiring. The central bankers voting in favor of a rate hike believe that the US labor market is nearing full employment, a condition where those willing and able to work are able to find jobs. According to these bankers, \u201ca further delay in raising the target range would unduly increase the risk of the unemployment rate falling markedly below its longer-run normal level\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Pound falls back as Davis says government cannot outline Brexit aims in detail  \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After another volatile day, the pound now seems to have settled around the $1.22 mark. That\u2019s a cent higher than last night, but still close to the record low struck after Tuesday\u2019s rout. The City has a lot to digest -- from the government\u2019s refusal to hold a vote on triggering article 50 to warnings that City jobs could move to New York if the UK leaves the single market. So here\u2019s our latest news story on the financial implications of Brexit: A brief rally in the pound was quickly reversed on Wednesday after the government refused to make tariff-free access to the European Union\u2019s single market a red line in Brexit negotiations with Brussels. Investors sold the pound after Brexit minister David Davis told MPs it was \u201cnot black or white\u201d whether the UK would stay in the single market. Sterling fell two cents to $1.21 on the currency markets in afternoon trading, reversing a jump to $1.23 overnight that followed Theresa May\u2019s concession for parliament to hold a debate on the government\u2019s stance on talks with the EU. The U-turn in agreeing to a debate initially lifted markets, but the refusal of ministers to clarify the government\u2019s position provoked a swift reversal in sentiment and the pound ended the day at $1.22. The pound has tumbled since last week when in her party conference speech May appeared to put taking control over immigration above retaining access to the single market on the current tariff-free terms. According to Bank of England figures, which compare the pound to a basket of major currencies, the UK\u2019s currency has fallen to its lowest level since the 1970s, when records began. The figures show that the value of sterling has fallen to below the levels seen in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crisis and the slump in the pound in 1992 that followed \u201cBlack Wednesday\u201d and the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union exchange rate mechanism. Here\u2019s the full story: I\u2019ll be back tomorrow (unless sterling has a major wipeout tonight, in which case I\u2019ll fire this blog up again,..) GW The FT have an interesting Brexit story tonight. They\u2019re reporting that Brussels wants the UK to stump up \u20ac20bn in \u2018divorce payments\u2019, to cover commitments in the EU budget - from pension contributions to Britain\u2019s share of large projects. That could spark a major row that could make it harder to agree an amicable split..... The story is here (behind the FT paywall), and here\u2019s the top line: Unilever and Tesco aren\u2019t the only companies struggling to come to terms with the slump in sterling. Other businesses chiefs, including the boss of BT, have also warned that prices are going to rise as firms pass on higher import costs to consumers. The Press Association also noticed that the pound shed its early gains after David Davis began outlining the government\u2019s Brexit plans (in rather limited detail). My colleague John Harris can see the big picture: The clash between Tesco and Unilever over the weak pound is causing a stir on social media: And one for foreign exchange traders... The pound is clinging onto today\u2019s modest gains, after the minutes of the last meeting of America\u2019s central bank policymakers was released. The minutes show that \u201cseveral members\u201d of the Federal Reserve favour raising US interest rates \u201crelatively soon\u201d, if the economy keeps performing as expected. However, others favoured hanging fire a bit longer, to see how inflation and employment play out. So, nothing too sensational. The prospect of a rate hike in December is helping the dollar to strengthen, but the pound is still up around one cent at $1.2222. As if Britain didn\u2019t have enough to worry about, the slump in the pound means you may not be able to pick up a jar of Marmite from Tesco. A row had broken out between the supermarket chain and consumer goods giant Unilever, over who should shoulder the impact of the weaker sterling, which has pushed up the cost of raw materials. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: Tesco is running short of stocks of a range of household brands from Marmite to Comfort fabric conditioner after a row with its major supplier Unilever. It is understood that Unilever has halted deliveries to Tesco after a dispute over price. The food, toiletries and household goods supplier has been attempting to raise prices across a wide range of goods by about 10%, blaming the falling value of the pound against the euro and the dollar. Some products are now unavailable on Tesco\u2019s website, and in short supply in the aisles, as Sarah adds: In different areas of the country a number of Unilever brands have sold out. They include Persil, Surf, Dove, Comfort, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream, Elmlea, Colman\u2019s, Helmann\u2019s, Marmite, Knorr, Bertolli, Flora, Comfort and Pot Noodle. Here\u2019s the full story: Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs has created a stir, by predicting that sterling could shed another 7%. The pound has already dropped by around 17% since the EU referendum; Goldman points out that 25% slumps aren\u2019t terribly uncommon.... A reminder, the UK parliament debate on Brexit is being covered in our politics live blog here: Meanwhile the pound has edged up a little, and is now 0.9% better at $1.2228. Ahead of the minutes from the latest US Federal Reserve meeting, and as the pound recovers slightly but remains close to its record lows, European markets have ended the day lower. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: A small recovery in US markets at the beginning of the session is already beginning to fizzle out, while the US dollar is doing well ahead of Fed minutes, on the expectation that the account of the most recent meeting will show a committee still keen to raise rates. As has been the case for the week thus far, attention has focused mainly on sterling, thanks to the absence of heavy-hitting UK data. The pound continues to lose ground, testing the water below $1.22 again, although indications that the UK government may have to navigate Parliament before activating Article 50 have helped to stem downside in cable today. In a quiet session the main event, Fed minutes, is still to come, and could yet reverse the weakness in equities and the relatively sparky performance of the dollar. Of particular note this afternoon is a possible breakout in dollar/yen which is finally trying to move meaningfully above Y104. 2016 has been, by and large, a year of yen strength, but it will be music to Shinzo Abe\u2019s ears if the Japanese currency finally begins to fall. After all, if the UK can do it, why not Japan? On the European markets, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 46.87 points or 0.66% at 7024.01 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.51% to 10,523.07 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.44% at 4452.24 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.02% to 16,470.28 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.08% at 8686.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.16% to 586.24 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 31 points or l0.18%. Here\u2019s our story on the debate in parliament, with MPs warning the government that the current uncertainty is hitting businesses and markets. Rowena Mason reports: A string of Tory and Labour MPs have warned David Davis, the Brexit secretary, that businesses and financial markets are being spooked by his lack of a plan for leaving the EU. Claire Perry, a Conservative former minister, said on Wednesday she was extremely concerned about the state of the pound and accused him of putting \u201cnarrow ideology\u201d ahead of the national interest, while Ken Clarke, the former chancellor, said no foreign companies would invest until there was more clarity about the UK\u2019s future relationship with the outside world. Chris Philp, a Tory backbencher, urged the Brexit secretary to give away more details, saying there was a \u201cdanger some [businesses] may take decisions in the next two or three months\u201d to pre-emptively scale back investment and move jobs. Others to raise concerns included the serial rebel Anna Soubry, a former business minister who attended cabinet, who demanded a yes or no answer as to whether the UK would be in the single market. The Brexit secretary said it was \u201cnot black or white\u201d whether the UK would stay in the single market and parliament could not expect to be given every detail of the government\u2019s plans for leaving. Davis said the government had a mandate to get the best possible deal but insisted he could go no further than talking about overarching aims because revealing the UK\u2019s top priority would prove \u201cextremely expensive\u201d. The full story is here: The pound is back below $1.22 as the lift from the government\u2019s promise of a Brexit debate fades, and the US currency strengthens on the growing expectation of a rate rise from the Federal Reserve before the end of the year. Sterling is currently at $1.2193, up 0.6% on the day having earlier climbed as high as $1.2325. Against the euro the pound is up 1% at \u20ac1.1075. A Treasury official has sought to ease fears about the City\u2019s future in a post-Brexit world. Reuters reports: Britain\u2019s financial services sector will be a \u201chigh priority\u201d for the government when it negotiates the terms of Britain\u2019s new relationship with the European Union, the most senior official in the country\u2019s finance ministry said. \u201cThe UK economy and UK exports are quite services-heavy, and financial services are an important part of that. So I think we will be very keen indeed to make sure the final agreement gives the proper place to financial services within that,\u201d Tom Scholar, permanent secretary at the Treasury said. \u201cSo it will have a high priority in our discussions,\u201d he said in a hearing before the lower house of parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee on Wednesday. Top bankers warned on Tuesday they could start moving staff abroad as early as next year if there is no clarity on Britain\u2019s access to the European single market once it leaves the EU. On the pound\u2019s moves today, Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: Though not as perky as at lunch time the pound has nevertheless held onto its earlier gains this afternoon. In the face of US investors keen to buy the dollar as Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign disintegrates, and a speech from Brexit minister David Davis that erred on the \u2018hard\u2019 side of things, the pound managed to rise 0.7% against the greenback and 0.8% against the euro this Wednesday. A slight comedown from its morning highs, then, but nevertheless the kind of respite sterling was crying out for by the end of yesterday\u2019s trading. Of course Brexit is not the only thing influencing currencies at the moment, the dollar in particular. The greenback is strengthening on the prospect of a possible US interest rate rise this year, with Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead in the US presidential race deemed to be something which could allow the Fed to move. The minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting, which left rates unchanged, will therefore be scrutinised for clues as to what the Fed members are thinking. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The US dollar has continued to be the primary beneficiary of this uncertainty hitting its highest levels since March, as markets look to the potential for a rate rise in December ahead of the publication later today of the latest FOMC minutes, where we will get further insight into the level of the dissent about last month\u2019s decision to hold rates steady. We know the doves were able to win the argument this time, however we don\u2019t know how wide the divisions were and whether any other members felt compelled to go with the dissenters, but harboured enough doubts to hold back and wait a little bit longer. If the minutes point to any waverers on the dove front then the US dollar could well take another leg higher. Some choice words from ex-chancellor Kenneth Clarke: Time for some charts. This one shows how the pound has suffered a volatile few days \u2013 starting with Friday\u2019s flash crash, and continuing with last night\u2019s rout. And this one, from fastFT, shows how the pound hit an all-time low against a basket of currencies last night (the data only goes back to mid-1880s). The FT\u2019s Mehreen Khan says: According to a trade-weighted index measuring sterling against a basket of its trading peers, the pound has now slumped to its lowest on record, stretching beyond the introduction of free-floating exchange rates in the 1970s, back to the mid-1800s according to data compiled by the Bank of England. The pound\u2019s effective exchange rate, which is weighted to reflect the UK\u2019s trade flows, hit a low of 73.38 on Tuesday \u2013 weaker than the depths hit during the financial crisis, Britain\u2019s ejection from the European Rate Mechanism in 1992, and its decision to leave the Gold Standard in the 1930s. The pound lurched back below $1.22 as the government outlined its Brexit strategy -- although David Davis didn\u2019t shed much new light on the situation. Secretary of state Davis promised to get the best possible terms for the UK as it leaves the EU, but refused to say whether, for example, it had ruled out retaining membership of the single market. Instead, Davis said he could only outline the government\u2019s \u201coverarching aims\u201d, saying: \u201cWe have been pretty clear on the overarching aims. Not the detailed aims. We\u2019re not even at the point that that\u2019s possible. Davis insists this is sensible, as the government isn\u2019t planning to trigger article 50 for several months. But this lack of detail could disappoint the financial markets as they try to get a grip on Brexit. So, the pound is now only up 0.6% against the US today, meaning it\u2019s close to the all-time record low hit yesterday. Remember, the deputy governor of the Bank of England has already warned today that markets don\u2019t cope well with political uncertainty.... Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX.com reckons that investors are fretting about Brexit again, after a brief respite this morning... British government debt is also dropping in value, hitting its weakest level since the end of June. The yield (or interest rate) on 10-year gilts has risen to 1.06%, from 0.98% last night. Yields rise when prices fall, so this means investors are selling gilts, pushing up the cost of servicing Britain\u2019s national debt and financing the deficit. Another day, another bout of sterling volatility.... Eek, the pound is now shedding some of its earlier surge. It\u2019s now up just one cent, at $1.22, having hit $1.23 earlier. Investors may be watching parliament, where David Davis, secretary of state for exiting the EU, has insisted no party will get a veto on Brexit. A fascinating debate is underway in the House of Commons now, as MPs discuss how they will scrutinise Brexit. Keir Starmer, Labour\u2019s shadow secretary for exiting the EU, is arguing that parliament must get a vote on the terms of leaving the European Union. Other members are agreeing, including former attorney general (and Conservative MP) Dominic Grieve: Andrew Sparrow is live-blogging the whole thing: We know that the pound hit a record low last night, but which way might it move next? Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at German bank Berenberg, suggests sterling could suffer fresh losses if Brexit negotiations get off on the wrong foot. The latest leg down for sterling reflects the shift in market expectations towards a hard Brexit following recent comments from Prime Minister May and her cabinet. Has sterling found a bottom? That depends on how Brexit negotiations play out. If the UK and EU clash noisily in the forthcoming negotiations or if the UK goes for a \u2019hard Brexit\u2019, a risk we cannot rule out, sterling is likely to continue to sink further. But... If the UK and the EU agree to part ways in an amicable manner, and if the UK secures good terms for post-Brexit trade, sterling is likely to rebound along with the UK economic outlook Confidence among Britain\u2019s food industry has been rattled since the Brexit vote, a new survey has found. Although the weak pound should help exports (making Mr Kipling cakes, Marmite and Scottish shortbread more affordable abroad), manufacturers are worried that they could face new tariffs once Britain leaves the EU. The EU referendum vote has forced international investors to get up to speed on the intricacies of the UK parliament, the EU single market, the untested article 50, and scrutinise every Brexit-related headline out of London and Brussels. The Financial Times columnist Janan Ganesh suggests markets should calm down.... An important point: The pound has kicked on a little, back towards $1.23, after prime minister Theresa May told MPs she will aim for \u201cmaximum access\u201d to the EU single market. May says she is determined to achieve the \u201cright deal for the UK.....operating in and trading with\u201d the European market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, though, criticised the government for lacking a clear Brexit plan. Our Politics Live blog has full coverage of Prime Minister\u2019s Questions: This chart confirms that the pound plunged to a record low last night: Newsflash: Yesterday\u2019s brutal selloff drove the pound down to its lowest ever level against a basket of other currencies. New data from the Bank of England shows that trade-weighted sterling crashed through its previous seven-year low during last night\u2019s trading, to depths not seen before. This index values the pound against a group of other currencies including the US dollar, yen, and euro. And it hit 73.383, on the Bank\u2019s index, tipping through the 73.495 plumbed in December 2008 as Britain crashed into recession and several banks were bailed out. This morning\u2019s rally means the pound has now pulled back from this nadir, but it\u2019s still a serious warning about the impact that Brexit has had on the pound. It\u2019s still close to a near-31 year low against the US dollar, and close to a six-year low against the euro today. Mike Bird of the Wall Street Journal has a good take: The Bank of England\u2019s broad effective exchange rate index for the pound shows that the currency is now worth less than it was at the height of the 2008-09 financial crisis, or in the aftermath of Black Wednesday, when sterling left the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Given the pound has declined from its once strong position throughout the last century, the current level means it has never traded lower against its trading partners. Reuters has more details too: Trade-weighted sterling index hits record low on Tuesday- BoE While I was watching Jon Cunliffe, Lloyds Banking Group announced it is cutting more than 1,300 jobs. Sir Jon Cunliffe\u2019s session at the House of Lords has now ended. Here are the key points from the Bank of England deputy governor: Markets are struggling to handle the political uncertainty created by Brexit. This could trigger further volatility as Britain heads to the EU exit door. There would be worrying consequences if Britain lost its \u2018euro clearing\u2019 business to Europe, as some politicians demand. Costs of finance could go up, and financial instability could increase. City jobs are more likely to migrate to New York, rather than into the European Union, after Brexit. It won\u2019t be easy to replicate the passport system that allows UK firms to offer financial services across the EU. The current \u2018frictionless\u2019 system will be lost, which could hurt the UK and Europe. Financial services firms need clarity about Brexit, and time to adjust. If they don\u2019t get it, they may be forced to trigger contingency plans. Q: What are the prospects of the UK continuing to have influence over the regulation of financial services in the EU, and globally, after Brexit? Sir Jon Cunliffe says the UK won\u2019t have influence from inside on the making of EU regulation, once it has left. We will necessarily lose influence, if you\u2019re not an EU member you can\u2019t be inside the machinery making EU law. But he expects the EU to maintain its commitment to international standards. I hope, presume, and will devote considerable effort to ensure Britain still influence those global standards, Cunliffe adds. Q: Would the Bank of England ever \u2018mark the card\u2019 of ministers over Brexit? Cunliffe says the Bank doesn\u2019t have that power, but it has a responsibility to monitor the UK financial system and make its views known. Onto the Brexit buzzword - uncertainty. Q: How will the Bank respond if politicians make pronouncements in the run-up to Brexit? Cunliffe repeats that markets have a general problem with political uncertainty, and there will be a lot of political noise around Brexit. The Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee is assessing the financial stability implications of Brexit, and will report on them through its regular publications, in the usual way. Ditto for the Monetary Policy Committee. Q: Is there a contradiction that banks want certainty, but they also want Brexit resolved quickly? Cunliffe says that: No matter how it\u2019s arranged, we just need a smooth and orderly progression from where we are to where we\u2019re going, wherever that is, so firms can plan and execute those plans. There are lots of ways we could proceed, but they are political choices. Q: But take Nissan. They won\u2019t wait three years before taking an investment decision.... That\u2019s true of financial firms as well, Cunliffe says. They have have shareholders... and if there\u2019s not certainty they may need to execute plans and prepare for the future anyway. You could reach a tipping point, and go ahead before you know the full details of Brexit. Q: Is there a serious risk that the euro clearing market could move out of London? Sir Jon Cunliffe says he\u2019s spent most of his career on this subject, and apologies for giving a long answer (don\u2019t worry, Sir Jon, this stuff matters....) He says it\u2019s unusual to see heads of state talking about something as technical as \u2018euro clearing\u2019. So there\u2019s a political significance to this, which may determine the outcome. [Background: French president Francois Hollande said in June that the UK won\u2019t be able to keep its euro clearing business after Brexit]. But on the technical issue -- euro clearing relates to the process by which banks clear complex derivative contracts priced in euros. He explains that after the 2008 financial crisis, regulators insisted that derivatives contracts are cleared centrally, so that they could see the state of play, and if any firms are getting in trouble. You avoid what happened in the financial crisis, where as the prices of assets move quickly, counter-parties make margin calls on other counter-parties, and the situation deteriorates quickly. Cunliffe says he was at the G20 meeting in Pittsburg when regulators decided to do this, and it was the right thing. But it needs central clearing, so you can net the risks. In other words, financial firms can \u2018net\u2019 off their margin calls, balancing contracts where are up, or down, and only post the balance. That reduces the stress in the system, meaning firms won\u2019t have to post as much capital or buy as much insurance. Cunliffe then, politely, rubbishes the idea that derivative contracts need to be cleared in the jurisdiction of the currency that they are issued in. Currently, London clears contracts priced in euros, dollars, and yen (for example). It you make multi-currency infrastructure impossible, then the cost of clearing derivatives will go up. And fragmenting the system could create financial stability risks, if the current set-up in London is replaced by several smaller operations. He says: I can understand the politics around this, but we\u2019re taking technically about multi-currency infrastructure. If we\u2019re talking about going to a world where you have to clear in the jurisdiction of issue, then the costs are going to go up in a pretty big way. Q: So are you saying that it\u2019s unlikely that euro clearing will move out of London to the EU, if it was a rational decision? I think the system works well now, Cunliffe replies diplomatically. City jobs are more likely to move to New York than to Europe, if Britain loses access to the single market, Sir Jon Cunliffe argues. The Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor tells the House of Lords committee that it\u2019s not plausible that London banks would move their operations to other European capitals. The current system is simply too complex, and reliant on other industries, so can\u2019t simply be copied.: I can\u2019t see London\u2019s financial ecosystem being replicated elsewhere in the foreseeable future, in one place in the European Union. It takes an awful lot of time, human capital, it\u2019s based around the interaction of financial services and other services. The idea that this ecosystem can be transplanted to Europe in the foreseeable future is highly unlikely. Cunliffe then cites research showing that a quarter of the value of a \u2018transaction chain\u2019 comes from other financial firms who take part in the transaction, and another quarter comes from non-financial companies such as lawyer. You need those things to be able to work together seamlessly. And in New York, that already happens. So some services could shift over the Atlantic, Cunliffe suggests. Cunliffe warns that both sides could lose out if Britain\u2019s financial services sector loses the right to offer services across the EU, as it can today. He says: If barriers are put up between London and Europe, forcing banks to hold more capital...then that will put up the cost of finance, and financial services , on both sides of the Channel. Q: Is there scope for an early deal that would allow the City to keep these \u2018financial passports\u2019, or some similar service? Cunliffe says there are currently 350,000 passports in operation (I think he means in the City) and most are outbound from the UK (for example, a London firm could offer insurance across the EU). He cites a recent report that found \u00a350bn to \u00a360bn of UK revenue was related to EU services, some of which would be lost without passporting rights. So it\u2019s a significant issue. Cunliffe repeats that those passports can\u2019t continue if Britain isn\u2019t in the single market, but the system could potentially be replicated. The committee ask Cunliffe for his views on the terms of Brexit, and whether a \u2018bespoke\u2019 deal would help the financial services industry. Cunliffe says that the single market currently allows UK financial firms to offer services \u2018relatively frictionlessly\u2019 across the EU, by using the passport. That will be lost, if Britain isn\u2019t a member of the single market, and sharing laws with other EU countries. If we\u2019re not in the single market, that means the current way that that relatively frictionless interactions take place won\u2019t continue. That doesn\u2019t mean it cannot continue, but it will need arranging in a new way. Currently, retail banking services don\u2019t rely on the EU single market, but \u2018wholesale services\u2019 do. So any \u2018bespoke deal\u2019 to protect the City would have to understand how those passporting permissions are used, and by who. Q: What\u2019s the impact of the plunge in sterling? Cunliffe: There\u2019s no numerical relationship between the fall in a currency and a rise in inflation. The important issue is why the exchange rate is changing. If it\u2019s moving because of uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with Europe, that could suggest that economic demand could be weakening. But he won\u2019t give a more detailed answer... Q: Has sterling over-reacted, or is it the right response? Cunliffe won\u2019t give a view on whether the markets are right, or wrong. They are processing news about the outcome. Then, he warns that global investors are disconcerted by Brexit, because it is a political issue which can\u2019t be easily fitted into their economic models. Markets find political uncertainty very difficult....And the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union will be the product of political processes here and in other countries. Sir Jon Cunliffe says there is \u201cgreat uncertainty\u201d over the extent to which companies will leave the City, because of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. Recent economic data has been more encouraging than feared before the referendum. But uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future trade links will weigh on business investment, he cautions. Cunliffe says he\u2019s not a great fan of terms like \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018soft\u2019 Brexit - you need to dig down into the details to see exactly what it means for, say, financial service firms in London (who can offer services across the EU today). And it\u2019s important that Brexit doesn\u2019t distract company management from wider financial stability issues. Cunliffe also says it\u2019s important that companies have enough time to adjust to the UK\u2019s new relationship with the EU. Sir Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor of the Bank of England, is testifying to the House of Lords EU Financial Affairs Sub-Committee, about Brexit\u2019s impact to financial services. It\u2019s being streamed live here. Cunliffe is explaining about how the Brexit vote was a shock, but one which the financial markets absorbed without disaster. The financial system is more robust to the shocks from market news, and the like. But there is still great uncertainty over the timing of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, and the details, Cunliffe continues. And the deputy governor then warns that we could see more more \u2018market induced financial events\u2019 as Brexit negotiations get underway. And he cites last week\u2019s sterling \u2018Flash Crash\u2019 as an example, adding. I wouldn\u2019t rule out.... as more news comes in, that there is potentially stress in markets. Q: So are you making more preparations ready for article 50 to be triggered in March 2017? Cunliffe says the BoE did a lot of contingency work before the referendum, and that work is still being used. Of course, we\u2019re in dialogue with other central banks, he adds. Sterling just had a little wobble, after the newswires flashed up that Theresa May\u2019s spokeswoman has said MPs won\u2019t get a vote on whether to trigger article 50. That\u2019s not a surprise, of course. But it shows how edgy the markets are right now. The pound is now hovering around $1.227, up 1.5 cents today. City traders are hoping that today\u2019s Opposition Day debate about Brexit scrutiny will provide some colour about the government\u2019s strategy. Peter O\u2019Flanagan, head of trading at Clear Treasury, says the markets are currently pricing in the \u201cworst case scenario\u201d for Brexit. The pound is still the worst performing currency across the globe this year and liquidity in the pound remains weak, but any talk around Brexit that might be deemed slightly positive provides scope for a relief rally. Here\u2019s our latest news story, explaining how Theresa May has agreed to allow MPs \u201cfull and transparent\u201d scrutiny of the process to exit the European Union. It\u2019s by Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart, who explain why the PM changed course (sending the pound leaping overnight). May had been facing her first government defeat over the motion on Wednesday, as a number of Conservatives indicated they were prepared to vote with Labour to demand greater public debate over the Brexit negotiating strategy. The concession does not go as far as specifying that MPs should get a formal vote on article 50 or any Brexit deal and slightly amends Labour\u2019s version to say the government\u2019s negotiating position must not be undermined. However, it does mean there will have to be a substantive parliamentary debate on No 10\u2019s strategy at a later date before the UK embarks on Brexit. One Tory MP said this means the Commons will have to broadly approve the negotiating position before article 50 is invoked. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said it was a significant U-turn and Labour would force the government to be accountable over Brexit. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the opposition would not let ministers \u201cgo into a locked room and come out with some plan that they want to keep secret\u201d. Morgan Stanley\u2019s head of currency strategy, Hans Redeker, welcomes the news that Theresa May will allow a debate on Brexit strategy. He says: After weeks of tough rhetoric pushing sterling into a trading environment closer to an emerging market currency, the government may aim to stabilise markets, with its rhetoric and suggestions now possibly shifting in tone,\u201d However, Redeker also questions whether MPs will really be given proper scrutiny. There is a fine line to walk as May\u2019s Conservative Party wants a clean split from Europe. In addition, giving in too much, even before Article 50 negotiations have started,shifts the negotiation advantage towards the EU. Hence, the pound\u2019s rebound should be limited and followed by a decline.\u201d Despite jumping by almost two cents this morning, the pound is still worth less than first thing yesterday morning. That\u2019s because sterling was duffed up in the foreign exchange markets last night, plummeting through the $1.21 mark. The pound then soared back overnight, following reports that Theresa May would allow MPs more Brexit scrutiny. Mike Bird of the Wall Street Journal has the details: Despite today\u2019s rally, the pound is still around 5% weaker than before the Conservative Party conference, where Theresa May promised to trigger article 50 within six months. The recent slide in sterling, and the alarming \u2018flash crash\u2019 last Friday, must have caused some concern in Downing Street (even though a weaker pound should help the economy rebalance). The Financial Times reports today that some senior Tories have admitted privately that the weak pound could create serious political headaches. Mrs May said last week that the fundamentals in the British economy were strong and that the economy had grown more strongly than many had expected after the June 23 Brexit vote. \u201cWe see sterling moving in different ways at different times,\u201d she said. But some Tory MPs warn that \u201cimported\u201d inflation will erode living standards and undermine Mrs May\u2019s attempts to help the \u201cordinary working-class\u201d Britons who saw the Brexit vote as a cry for help. The rising cost of fuel, food and foreign holidays are already being felt by families described by Mrs May as those who are \u201cjust getting by\u201d. Labour has called for pro-Brexit ministers to apologise. This chart, from Capital Economics, suggests the pound has been \u2018oversold\u2019 recently, compared to what you\u2019d expect based on likely interest rate moves. Today\u2019s sterling rally may not last, according to Neil Wilson, analyst at City firm ETX Capital. He reckons the pound will suffer more volatility, as the political drama around Brexit continues to play out. Theresa May\u2019s decision last night to allow the House of Commons a debate on the government\u2019s Brexit plans before triggering Article 50 seems to have allayed some of the concerns about a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 that had dominated since her speech at the Conservative Party conference. Bank of England policymakers had also appeared to talk the currency lower. But if traders think the mood is turning bullish for the pound, they\u2019re mistaken. The bears are still very much in control and this relief rally looks like a dead cat bounce London\u2019s stock market has dipped in early trading, sending the FTSE 100 index down by 21 points (or -0.3%) to 7049. That\u2019s partly due to this morning\u2019s sterling rally. A stronger pound isn\u2019t great news for internationally-focused companies, who earn most of their earnings in foreign currencies. Oh in other words: The pound is also enjoying a good morning against the euro, up over 1% at \u20ac1.108. Asa Bennett of the Daily Telegraph has a good explanation of how MPs are being allowed more scrutiny of the government\u2019s Brexit plans. This is from his morning email: The Government may not want to give a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on its Brexit strategy, but MPs are very keen for Parliament to have its say. Some Tory MPs are among them, with Stephen Phillips warning ministers that they would be acting like a \u201ctyranny\u201d to negotiate Brexit without consulting Parliament. \u201cThat really is a democratic deficit,\u201d writes Philip Johnston in today\u2019s paper. \u201cActually, let\u2019s not mince words. That\u2019s dictatorship.\u201d Brexit means Brexit, James Kirkup adds, \u201cbut Parliament is Parliament\u201d. Labour is hoping to exploit this concern by pushing an Opposition Day motion today calling for Parliament to be able to scrutinise the government\u2019s Brexit plan before Article 50 is triggered, and offering 170 questions for ministers to answer. It looks like the Opposition has scored a direct hit, as the Government moved last night to table a surprise amendment offering MPs extra Parliamentary scrutiny of the Brexit process in order to prevent Tory MPs from rebelling, which Labour has trumpeted as \u201cone hell of a climbdown\u201d. Paul Donovan of Swiss bank UBS confirms that this \u2018surprise amendment\u2019 has help the pound to rally. He writes: The UK government indicated that Parliament may have a say on its negotiation stance ahead of the exit discussions with the EU. The change in the nuance of the government\u2019s position has halted the seemingly inexorable decline of sterling. Markets are once again the idle playthings of politicians\u2019 whims. The pound is rallying hard this morning, following signs that the government will allow MPs more scrutiny of its plans to leave the European Union. Sterling has gained more than 1.5 cents this morning, popping back over the $1.23 mark as traders give the pound new vote of confidence. Last night, it fell as low as $1.208, on fears that a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 would hurt the UK economy. So what\u2019s changed? Well, overnight, Theresa May\u2019s government has accepted that MPs should be allowed a \u201cfull and transparent debate on the government\u2019s plans to leave the EU\u201d. This proposals comes from the opposition Labour party, which is demanding \u201cproper scrutiny\u201d of May\u2019s plans in Parliament before Article 50 is triggered, in March 2017. Labour\u2019s proposal will be debated in parliament today, and May has already signalled that she will allow such a debate But she\u2019s also added an amendment, insisting that such scrutiny shouldn\u2019t \u201cundermine the negotiating position of the government\u201d. Effectively she doesn\u2019t want her hands tied during the Brexit negotiations by MPs back in London. She\u2019s also NOT allowing MPs a formal vote on whether to trigger article 50. But still....Labour MP Keir Starmer says this is a victory for MPs who have been demanding proper parliamentary scrutiny of the government\u2019s plans for Brexit. The prospect of MPs giving the Brexit plan more scrutiny has reassured investors, as it could limit the prospects of a damaging \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 which would see the UK banished from the single market. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says it\u2019s quite a turnaround for the pound, after four days of chunky losses: What a difference a day makes, the pound is the top performer in the G10 on Wednesday, rising by more than 1.3% versus the euro, and 1% versus the US dollar. The trigger was a surprise announcement from Prime Minister Theresa May that she will allow Parliament to vote on her plan to take the EU out of the European Union. This will allow the UK\u2019s elected representatives to scrutinize Theresa May\u2019s plans for Brexit. It has triggered a relief rally in the pound on Wednesday, as it could potentially limit the prospect of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d taking the UK out of the single market, which has been a major concern for some investors and the business community in recent days. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019ll be watching the pound closely again, after last night\u2019s heavy losses sent sterling down below the $1.21 mark last night. Overnight, a government advisor has warned that leaving the EU customs union would have a significant negative impact on the UK economy, in the long term. That\u2019s added to concerns that Britain\u2019s financial sector will suffer badly from Brexit, if banks start to shift jobs out of the City. Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe should give his views this morning; he\u2019s testifying to the House of Lords from 10am on Brexit\u2019s impact on the UK financial services business. And airline group Monarch is just announcing a new \u00a3165m funding deal that should keep it running. More on that shortly....",

Of particular note this afternoon is a possible breakout in dollar/yen which is finally trying to move meaningfully above Y104. 2016 has been, by and large, a year of yen strength, but it will be music to Shinzo Abe\u2019s ears if the Japanese currency finally begins to fall.

So there\u2019s a political significance to this, which may determine the outcome.</p> <p>[Background: <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-29/hollande-says-brexit-to-hurt-city-of-london-in-clearing-warning\">French president Francois Hollande said in June that the UK won\u2019t be able to keep its euro clearing business after Brexit</a>].</p> <p><strong>But on the technical issue -- euro clearing relates to the process by which banks clear complex derivative contracts priced in euros.</strong></p> <p>He explains that after the 2008 financial crisis, regulators insisted that derivatives contracts are cleared centrally, so that they could see the state of play, and if any firms are getting in trouble.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You avoid what happened in the financial crisis, where as the prices of assets move quickly, counter-parties make margin calls on other counter-parties, and the situation deteriorates quickly.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cunliffe says he was at the G20 meeting in Pittsburg when regulators decided to do this, and it was the right thing. </p> <p><strong>But it needs central clearing, so you can net the risks.</strong><br></p> <p>In other words, financial firms can \u2018net\u2019 off their margin calls, balancing contracts where are up, or down, and only post the balance. That reduces the stress in the system, meaning firms won\u2019t have to post as much capital or buy as much insurance.</p> <p>Cunliffe then, politely, rubbishes the idea that derivative contracts need to be cleared in the jurisdiction of the currency that they are issued in.</p> <p>Currently, London clears contracts priced in euros, dollars, and yen (for example).</p> <p>It you make multi-currency infrastructure impossible, then the cost of clearing derivatives will go up.</p> <p>And fragmenting the system could create financial stability risks, if the current set-up in London is replaced by several smaller operations.</p> <p>He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can understand the politics around this, but we\u2019re taking technically about multi-currency infrastructure.</p> <p>If we\u2019re talking about going to a world where you have to clear in the jurisdiction of issue, then the costs are going to go up in a pretty big way.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: So are you saying that it\u2019s unlikely that euro clearing will move out of London to the EU, if it was a rational decision?</em></p> <p>I think the system works well now, Cunliffe replies diplomatically.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T10:24:49.798Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57fe04bde4b01d9dd2c90200\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-10-12T09:50:41.496Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cunliffe: City jobs could move to New York after Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20682ee343a0b11cffe65f464b5e38a258851ed1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20682ee343a0b11cffe65f464b5e38a258851ed1/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wall Street, in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wall Street, in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>City jobs are more likely to move to New York than to Europe, if Britain loses access to the single market, Sir Jon Cunliffe argues.</strong><br></p> <p>The Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor tells the House of Lords committee that it\u2019s not plausible that London banks would move their operations to other European capitals.</p> <p>The current system is simply too complex, and reliant on other industries, so can\u2019t simply be copied.:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can\u2019t see London\u2019s financial ecosystem being replicated elsewhere in the foreseeable future, in one place in the European Union.</p> <p>It takes an awful lot of time, human capital, it\u2019s based around the interaction of financial services and other services.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The idea that this ecosystem can be transplanted to Europe in the foreseeable future is highly unlikely.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cunliffe then cites research showing that a quarter of the value of a \u2018transaction chain\u2019 comes from other financial firms who take part in the transaction, and another quarter comes from non-financial companies such as lawyer.</p> <p>You need those things to be able to work together seamlessly.</p> <p><strong>And in New York, that already happens.

      "bodyText": "It is the largest investment in our 48-year history, crowed Andrew Swaffield, chief executive of Monarch, after securing a \u00a3165m injection from owner Greybull Capital. He should contain his excitement. Asking your shareholder for a large handout is not usually seen as a mark of success. At easyJet and Ryanair, the cash flows to the owners in the form of strong dividends, which is how the game is supposed to work, though it rarely has at Monarch in recent years. Greybull deserves credit for answering the call. If its choice was simple, one assumes the private equity firm would have stepped up before the Civil Aviation Authority started prowling around. Last month\u2019s episode, in which the regulator arranged for planes to recover stranded passengers should Monarch be unable to renew its operating licence, was unhelpful for the brand. Greybull is not a charity and its decision will reflect hard-headed calculations. First, it committed \u00a375m in the last rescue and so would be reluctant to call time if the turnaround plan is viable. Second, the plan has one easy-to-identify saving in the form of lower fuel costs when more efficient Boeings arrive on improved sale-and-leaseback terms. Third, there is the hope that the industry cannot suffer another of disruption year like the one it just had. Monarch was reduced to break-even levels, from a pre-tax profit of \u00a319m a year ago. Note that the first of new planes will not land until 2018 and the new fleet will be phased in over the following three years. In the meantime, the European short-haul market will continue to be oversupplied and easyJet and Ryanair will make the running on ticket prices. Greybull may have a fourth factor in mind \u2013 that it is easier to secure a sale, or partial sale, now that the Atol operating licence is in place. The last rumour said the Chinese owner of Hainan Airlines was interested in buying a stake. In Greybull\u2019s shoes, you would surely be tempted to look for an exit, or at least a way to de-risk an investment that has suddenly become much larger than planned. Exceedingly panicky times ahead for Mr Kipling owner Mr Kipling, you might think, is a chap who would enjoy a late British summer and the chance to spend a lazy afternoon in the fresh air nibbling on a French fancy, or suchlike. It turns out he hated the hot September. Or, rather, parent company Premier Foods did. Its trading update was a long grumble about how warm it has been for the time of year. Cakes, it should be said, were innocent. Premier\u2019s culprits were gravy, puddings and custard. Group sales fell 5.4% in the second quarter of the financial year and trading profit for first half was \u201cslightly lower\u201d than a year ago. Don\u2019t worry, soothed chief executive Gavin Darby, full-year expectations for profit are unchanged due to \u201cthe careful management of costs\u201d. On translation, he means he has cut the advertising budget. A planned 10% increase has been reversed, which looks a panicky decision from a company that has spent the past couple of years telling its shareholders that advertising works wonders on a portfolio of brands than runs from Oxo to Ambrosia to Angel Delight. If Darby has been tempted by short-termist tactics, it would be understandable. He fought off a 65p-a-share takeover approach from US group McCormick, the Schwartz spice folk, -this year. That offer was at twice the share price at the time, which brings demands for quick improvements. A profits warning \u2013 as opposed to news of action to avert one \u2013 would have cranked the pressure up another notch. As it was, the shares fell 6% to 49p on Wednesday. The peak Christmas trading period will also be sweaty for Darby. Energy providers fired up by threat of government intervention \u201cIt\u2019s just not right that two-thirds of energy customers are stuck on the most expensive tariffs,\u201d said Theresa May, in the style of Ed Miliband, at the Tory party conference. Her phrasing was slightly inaccurate since most of those customers aren\u2019t stuck; it\u2019s just that they have never bothered to switch supplier, or are so baffled by the complexity of tariffs that they are deterred. But the prime minister\u2019s drift was clear: there will be a policy response. If so, the big six suppliers face assault on two fronts because the switching brigade is growing in number. Analysts at Jefferies noted another 21% year-on-year rise in September; so far this year, they calculate, switches have risen 25% and independent suppliers have gained a net 900,000 customers. Jefferies predicts that by 2019 the independents\u2019 share of the market will reach 26% and the big six\u2019s top-line profits will fall by 22%. That\u2019s a big shift \u2013 and it\u2019s happening before May gets to work. Expect a massive lobbying effort by the old order: government intervention represents a real danger that probably isn\u2019t reflected in share prices.",

      "body": "<p>It is the largest investment in our 48-year history, crowed Andrew Swaffield, chief executive of Monarch, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/monarch-airlines-gets-165m-lifeline-to-stay-afloat\">securing a \u00a3165m injection from owner Greybull Capital</a>. He should contain his excitement. Asking your shareholder for a large handout is not usually seen as a mark of success. At easyJet and Ryanair, the cash flows to the owners in the form of strong dividends, which is how the game is supposed to work, though it rarely has at Monarch in recent years.</p> <p>Greybull deserves credit for answering the call. If its choice was simple, one assumes the private equity firm would have stepped up before the Civil Aviation Authority started prowling around. Last month\u2019s episode, in which the regulator arranged for planes to recover stranded passengers should Monarch be unable to renew its operating licence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/26/monarch-airlines-denies-rumours-of-financial-trouble\">was unhelpful for the brand</a>.</p> <p>Greybull is not a charity and its decision will reflect hard-headed calculations. First, it committed \u00a375m in the last rescue and so would be reluctant to call time if the turnaround plan is viable. Second, the plan has one easy-to-identify saving in the form of lower fuel costs when more efficient Boeings arrive on improved sale-and-leaseback terms.</p> <p>Third, there is the hope that the industry cannot suffer another of disruption year like the one it just had. Monarch was reduced to break-even levels, from a pre-tax profit of \u00a319m a year ago.</p> <p>Note that the first of new planes will not land until 2018 and the new fleet will be phased in over the following three years. In the meantime, the European short-haul market will continue to be oversupplied and easyJet and Ryanair will make the running on ticket prices.</p> <p>Greybull may have a fourth factor in mind \u2013 that it is easier to secure a sale, or partial sale, now that the Atol operating licence is in place. The last rumour said the Chinese owner of Hainan Airlines was interested in buying a stake. In Greybull\u2019s shoes, you would surely be tempted to look for an exit, or at least a way to de-risk an investment that has suddenly become much larger than planned.</p> <h2>Exceedingly panicky times ahead for Mr Kipling owner</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6bec9d038531dd0f82f90efaf8632c201b14c19e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bec9d038531dd0f82f90efaf8632c201b14c19e/0_170_5117_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"French fancies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Premier Foods sales fell 5.4% in the second quarter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mr Kipling, you might think, is a chap who would enjoy a late British summer and the chance to spend a lazy afternoon in the fresh air nibbling on a French fancy, or suchlike. It turns out he hated the hot September. Or, rather, parent company Premier Foods did. Its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/premier-foods-profit-appetite-hit-by-hot-september\">trading update </a>was a long grumble about how warm it has been for the time of year.</p> <p>Cakes, it should be said, were innocent. Premier\u2019s culprits were gravy, puddings and custard. Group sales fell 5.4% in the second quarter of the financial year and trading profit for first half was \u201cslightly lower\u201d than a year ago. Don\u2019t worry, soothed chief executive Gavin Darby, full-year expectations for profit are unchanged due to \u201cthe careful management of costs\u201d.</p> <p>On translation, he means he has cut the advertising budget. A planned 10% increase has been reversed, which looks a panicky decision from a company that has spent the past couple of years telling its shareholders that advertising works wonders on a portfolio of brands than runs from Oxo to Ambrosia to Angel Delight.</p> <p>If Darby has been tempted by short-termist tactics, it would be understandable. He fought off a 65p-a-share takeover approach from US group McCormick, the Schwartz spice folk, -this year. That offer was at twice the share price at the time, which brings demands for quick improvements. A profits warning \u2013 as opposed to news of action to avert one \u2013 would have cranked the pressure up another notch. As it was, the shares fell 6% to 49p on Wednesday. The peak Christmas trading period will also be sweaty for Darby.</p> <h2>Energy providers fired up by threat of government intervention</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e627ff32a661ab70008525eed8dd3b6bfa394fd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e627ff32a661ab70008525eed8dd3b6bfa394fd0/0_0_4256_2828/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A kettle boils on a stove\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Energy supplier switches have risen by 25% this year, figures show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just not right that two-thirds of energy customers are stuck on the most expensive tariffs,\u201d said Theresa May, in the style of Ed Miliband, at the Tory party conference. Her phrasing was slightly inaccurate since most of those customers aren\u2019t stuck; it\u2019s just that they have never bothered to switch supplier, or are so baffled by the complexity of tariffs that they are deterred. But the prime minister\u2019s drift was clear: there will be a policy response.<br></p> <p>If so, the big six suppliers face assault on two fronts because the switching brigade is growing in number. Analysts at Jefferies noted another 21% year-on-year rise in September; so far this year, they calculate, switches have risen 25% and independent suppliers have gained a net 900,000 customers. Jefferies predicts that by 2019 the independents\u2019 share of the market will reach 26% and the big six\u2019s top-line profits will fall by 22%. That\u2019s a big shift \u2013 and it\u2019s happening before May gets to work.</p> <p>Expect a massive lobbying effort by the old order: government intervention represents a real danger that probably isn\u2019t reflected in share prices.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A brief rally in the pound was quickly reversed on Wednesday after the government refused to make tariff-free access to the European Union\u2019s single market a red line in Brexit negotiations with Brussels. Investors sold the pound after Brexit minister David Davis told MPs it was \u201cnot black or white\u201d whether the UK would stay in the single market. Sterling fell two cents to $1.21 on the currency markets in afternoon trading, reversing a jump to $1.23 overnight that followed Theresa May\u2019s concession for parliament to hold a debate on the government\u2019s stance on talks with the EU. The U-turn in agreeing to a debate initially lifted markets, but the refusal of ministers to clarify the government\u2019s position provoked a swift reversal in sentiment and the pound ended the day at $1.22. The pound has tumbled since last week when in her party conference speech May appeared to put taking control over immigration above retaining access to the single market on the current tariff-free terms. According to Bank of England figures, which compare the pound to a basket of major currencies, the UK\u2019s currency has fallen to its lowest level since the 1970s, when records began. The figures show that the value of sterling has fallen to below the levels seen in the aftermath of the 2008 banking crisis and the slump in the pound in 1992 that followed \u201cBlack Wednesday\u201d and the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union exchange rate mechanism. Business leaders warned that without a rapid recovery in the pound\u2019s value, the cost of imported goods in the shops would begin to rise, hitting household disposable incomes. Justin King said that supermarkets, already suffering from a prolonged price war, would be unable to absorb the recent rise in the cost of importing goods, forcing them to push up prices on the shelves. A row between Tesco and Unilever gave a foretaste of the likely disputes between suppliers and retailers after reports that the Dove soap manufacturer attempted to push through an across the board 10% rise in the price of its branded goods, which was resisted by the supermarket chain. Mike Rake, the chairman of BT, said imported mobile phones and broadband home hubs were already 10% more expensive and the cost would need to be passed on to consumers in the near future. Jordan Rochester, a Nomura analyst, said the pound was likely to continue its decline over the coming weeks. \u201cWhile Theresa May\u2019s acceptance that parliament should scrutinise her plan for Brexit in part provides for some form of a pre-article 50 \u2018checks and balances\u2019 procedure, it is unlikely to result in a detailed plan being revealed nor change the current government stance,\u201d he said. Kathleen Brooks, research director at the financial trading firm City Index, said: \u201cEvery time Davis opens his mouth the pound falls because he is such a hard Brexiteer. But ultimately it will be May and Philip Hammond that make the decisions and investors were trying to work out which way they are going to go.\u201d She said a rise in prices could spook backbench Tory MPs who want to break free from the EU to cut tariffs and lower prices in the shops. \u201cIt could be that the Bank of England starts to raise rates to calm inflation, making the situation for low income families even worse,\u201d she said. Analysts said the US election was also influencing the situation after polls showing Donald Trump slipping in the race strengthened the dollar. Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead in the US presidential race is also seen as a green light to the US central bank to raise interest rates in December or early next year.",

      "bodyText": "New York is better placed than major European financial centres to benefit from any loss of business in the City of London as a result of Brexit, a deputy governor of the Bank of England has said. Amid attempts by Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin to catch possible fallout from London, Sir Jon Cunliffe said it was highly unlikely that any EU centre could replicate the services offered by the UK\u2019s financial services industry. \u201cI can\u2019t see [what the City offers] being replicated in the foreseeable future in one place in the European Union,\u201d he said, pointing out that huge parts of the UK financial services industry are based outside London. \u201cIt takes an awful lot of time, human capital, it\u2019s based around the interaction of financial services. Theidea this ecosystem is transplanted somewhere else into Europe in the foreseeable future \u2026 I think to me is highly unlikely,\u201d he told peers on the EU financial affairs subcommittee. Asked whether business would move to the US, Cunliffe said: \u201cCould it be transported to New York? Well of course it already exists in New York.\u201d It is a view that has been voiced by Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, who had said European financial centres would not enjoy \u201ceasy pickings\u201d after Britain leaves the EU and that New York would be more likely to benefit. The debate about how much of its financial services industry the UK will lose as a result of Brexit is raging. The major players are keen to retain access to the remaining 27 members of the European single market and so-called passporting rights making it easy to conduct business across the EU. The government appears to be leaning towards a \u201chard Brexit\u201d under which such access to the single market is less certain. Another senior Bank of England figure, Anil Kashyap, a newly appointed independent policymaker, said this week that the UK would lose out from taxes paid by City workers if jobs moved out of London as a result of a hard Brexit. Cunliffe, who was careful not to drawn into the political debate, said it was important that the final outcome was reached \u201cin a smooth and orderly way\u201d. But he did say that the cost of raising loans would increase, not just for UK companies, if the current business conducted in London were to fragment. The deputy governor responsible for financial stability, Cunliffe also played down the suggestion that London would be forced to give up its role in clearing euro-denominated transactions. He said the result of the 23 June referendum had been surprise for the markets, and pointed to the impact of politics on the pound. \u201cI think the hardest news for markets to process is political news. I think markets find political uncertainty very difficult to estimate as opposed to economic uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cAs more news comes into the markets, markets will react.\u201d Last week, a strategist at HSBC, David Bloom, said: \u201cThe currency is now the de facto official opposition to the government\u2019s policies.\u201d Appearing before the peers, Cunliffe also referred to the sudden moves in the pound last week. The Bank of England and the Bank for International Settlements \u2013 known as the central bankers\u2019 bank \u2013 is scrutinising the events of last Friday when a so-called flash crash resulted in the pound falling 10% against the dollar in a matter of minutes before recovering some of its losses.",

The major players are keen to retain access to the remaining 27 members of the European single market and so-called passporting rights making it easy to conduct business across the EU. The government appears to be leaning towards a \u201chard Brexit\u201d under which such access to the single market is less certain.</p> <p>Another senior Bank of England figure, Anil Kashyap, a newly appointed independent policymaker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/11/bank-of-engalnd-brexit-city-force-jobs-london-eu-referendum\">said this week</a> that the UK would lose out from taxes paid by City workers if jobs moved out of London as a result of a hard Brexit.</p> <p>Cunliffe, who was careful not to drawn into the political debate, said it was important that the final outcome was reached \u201cin a smooth and orderly way\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Two coal power plants will be paid a combined \u00a377m to be on standby this winter as part of National Grid\u2019s plan to minimise the risk of electricity blackouts. The size of the UK\u2019s capacity margin \u2013 the buffer zone between available power supply and predicted peak demand \u2013 will be revealed on Friday when National Grid publishes its winter outlook. The margin is understood to be higher than the 5.5% predicted by National Grid earlier this year. That was itself an improvement on last year\u2019s \u201ctight but manageable\u201d 5.1%. The improved position has been achieved partly by paying around \u00a3144m for tools that can be used in case of unexpected events, such as a shutdown at a major power plant. The largest of these tools is the supplemental balancing reserve (SBR), under which power plants are paid to be on standby for four months, ready to start up if needed. Of the eight firms to win SBR contracts, the largest is the Eggborough coal power plant in North Yorkshire, which has agreed to provide up to 681MW of power. Calculations by the climate campaign group Sandbag, and confirmed by separate industry sources, suggest Eggborough will be paid \u00a360m to be on standby. The sum is the equivalent of more than 10% of the plant\u2019s revenue during its last 18-month reporting period. A coal plant owned by the power firm SSE at Fiddler\u2019s Ferry in Cheshire is understood to have been paid \u00a317m for the same service, making 422MW available. Both plants will earn more if they are told to move to \u201chot standby\u201d, an advanced state of readiness, and they will also be paid during startup and if they are asked to generate power. They will earn \u00a33,908 and \u00a33,000 an hour respectively to be on hot standby and \u00a311,513 and \u00a33,000 an hour while starting up. They will be paid for any energy they generate at guaranteed prices well above the average wholesale price. The Sandbag energy analyst Dave Jones pointed out that coal power plants also stand to make millions from other subsidies and price spikes when energy demand is high. \u201cMany coal power plants are on for a bumper 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cThe transition to phase out coal is happening quickly, but National Grid, Ofgem and the government must make sure the transition is not more expensive than it needs to be.\u201d National Grid is estimated to have spent \u00a3122m on SBR contracts this year, up from \u00a333.9m last winter, to ensure that 3.6GW of capacity can be activated if needed. Peak demand is forecast to be 52.7GW this winter, while 54.7GW of capacity is available to draw on. The extra spending is partly down to the closure of other coal plants as the UK aims to phase out the heavily polluting energy source by 2025. The SBR is among several measures designed to minimise the risk of blackouts. National Grid is also paying for demand-side response, under which businesses are paid to use less energy, or change the time that they use it, if there is high demand. The measures have cost \u00a3144m this year, or \u00a31.80 on the average household bill, according to an estimate by the Energy &amp; Climate Intelligence Unit. The measures are designed to avoid blackouts in the event of a perfect storm of problems, such as multiple power plant failures during the high-demand afternoon period on a cold, windless day. This winter is the last in which the emergency toolkit will be used. From next winter the new capacity market auction, one of several electricity market reforms and under which firms bid to provide power to National Grid, is expected to ease the constraint on capacity margins. But the government is facing calls to make it easier for demand-side response to be used, rather than simply ratcheting up the amount of energy being produced by power plants.",

      "bodyText": "The Post Office is facing further strike action after the trustees of its pension fund voted to approve a plan to cut benefits. After the trustees\u2019 vote, about half the Post Office\u2019s 7,000-member workforce will be forced to shift from a final-salary pension scheme to a defined contribution scheme, a move that unions say could cut retirement benefits by 30% or even more in some cases. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said it expected the pension scheme to close in April, despite the fact that it was in surplus by \u00a3143m, making it one of the best funded schemes in the UK. Dave Ward, general secretary of the CWU, said: \u201cThe Post Office\u2019s decision will cost our members thousands of pounds in their retirement. It\u2019s wholly unjustified and we\u2019re seeing a publicly owned company effectively stealing money from people who have diligently saved for their retirement. The government cannot wash its hands of this. \u201cIt\u2019s more cuts from this irresponsible management team who seem obsessed with managing decline instead of encouraging a thriving Post Office.\u201d Ward said the union, which represents postal workers, would announce its plans for strike action after a meeting of its executive next week. Unite, which represents 732 Post Office managers, said its members planned to take industrial action within the next month. More than 300 major Post Offices were affected when members of both unions went on strike last month in protest at the planned changes. The Post Office\u2019s final-salary scheme was closed to new members in 2008 but long-serving staff have continued to accrue benefits since then. The trustees have approved the closure of the scheme to new accruals and from April members will only be able to build benefits in a new defined contribution scheme. Unlike a final-salary scheme, which promises a specific income, the income from a defined contribution scheme is dependent on the amount paid in and the performance of the fund\u2019s investments. Unions are also angry about plans to put 20 more directly run Crown offices into private hands, taking the total this year to 85. Unions see the move as a form of backdoor privatisation of the service. Unite called on the government to step in to ensure that the Post Office had a \u201ccoherent strategy\u201d that would allow it to move forward sustainably. Brian Scott, Unite\u2019s officer for the Post Office, said: \u201cThe government has a responsibility for this and needs to accept responsibility as the shareholder.\u201d He said Margot James, the government minister responsible for the Post Office, should launch an investigation to \u201censure that this much-cherished organisation has a sustainable future, when currently its prospects are bleak for both its customers and workforce\u201d. Mark Davies, communications and corporate affairs director at Post Office, said: \u201cWe are disappointed that our unions are again talking about strikes when we continue to try to reach a constructive way forward through talks at Acas. We can reassure our customers that, if strikes go ahead, the vast majority of people working at Post Office branches would not be involved and almost all of our network will be open for business and operating normally. \u201cMore than 11,000 branches \u2013 97% of the Post Office network \u2013 are run by independent businesses and the 50,000 people who work in these branches are not involved in the strike action.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British shoppers should brace themselves for higher prices following the steep fall in the pound since the Brexit vote, the former boss of Sainsbury\u2019s has said. Justin King said supermarkets would be unable to absorb the recent rise in the cost of importing goods caused by the falling value of the pound against the dollar and euro. Instead, said King, they would soon pass on the costs to consumers in higher prices. Mike Rake, the chairman of BT, speaking at the same conference as King in London on Wednesday, said imported mobile phones and broadband home hubs were already 10% more expensive and the cost would have to be passed on to consumers in the near future. Sterling has come under intense pressure over the past week on signals from Theresa May\u2019s government that it will go for a hard Brexit deal that sacrifices single market access in favour of stricter immigration controls. Since the vote to leave the European Union the pound has fallen 20% against the dollar and 22% against the euro. It was trading at just under $1.22 on Wednesday afternoon, after a further plunge in value on Tuesday. Business lobby groups have previously said consumers will face a steep rise in import costs on a range of goods from cars to clothes as a result of the currency drop. But the UK\u2019s annual inflation rate stayed at 0.6% last month, confounding City forecasts of a small rise in the cost of living due to imports becoming more expensive. King, who is now a vice-chairman of private equity firm Terra Firma, said: \u201cRetailers\u2019 margins are already squeezed. So there is no room to absorb input price pressures and costs will need to be passed on. \u201cBut no one wants to be the first to break cover. No business wants to be the first to blame Brexit for a rise in prices. But once someone does, there will be a flood of companies because they will all be suffering.\u201d Rake, a former chairman of the accountancy firm KPMG, said: \u201cWe have already had a 10% increase in mobile phone handsets and home hubs, and that will need to be passed on at some point.\u201d It is believed that many high street retailers and consumer goods importers have hedged their currency risks for at least the rest of the year. But that only means increases in the cost of some imported goods being delayed until next year.",

      "bodyText": "After years of silence, monetary policy is once again a topic of political discussion. A week ago Theresa May\u2019s conference speech surprised many observers with a radical change of tune: \u201cWhile monetary policy with super-low rates and quantitative easing have provided emergency medicine, we have to acknowledge some of the bad side effects. People with assets have got richer, while people without have not \u2026 A change has got to come.\u201d The prime minister made similar comments during her first speech after taking office and the significance of these remarks should not be underestimated. Over the past couple of decades there has been a broad consensus that the Bank of England should be left to carry out monetary policy in total isolation from the government\u2019s fiscal policy. That consensus is beginning to break. May understands that monetary policy is not working for the majority of people. Quantitative easing (QE) is increasing inequality, and low interest rates aren\u2019t the solution for an economy that is still burdened with high levels of private debt. The tools are broken. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, responded to the prime minister\u2019s comments by admitting that some had benefited more than others from QE. However, he put the responsibility of addressing inequality squarely with the government, stating: \u201cEvery monetary policy action has distributional consequences. It is not for the central bank to address these consequences. It is for the government to offset them.\u201d But more economists are pointing out that monetary policy is in intellectual crisis. Central banks\u2019 tools of low interest rates and QE are clearly failing to boost the economy. Low interest rates have failed to stimulate the economy \u2013 we had one of the slowest recoveries from a recession in history \u2013 because people and businesses don\u2019t want to take on more debt. Low interest rates only work by encouraging more private sector borrowing. But levels of private debt are still very high so there isn\u2019t much room to take on even more. And of course, as the IMF recently noted, the best indicator that a financial crisis isn\u2019t far off is a buildup of private debt \u2013 so it\u2019s not something central banks should be encouraging lightly. QE is failing on its own terms and is having disastrous consequences. A growing number of economists are warning that QE is a key driver of inequality. This was confirmed by the Bank\u2019s research, which found that QE has made the top 5% of households richer by an average of \u00a3128,000 each. Then there\u2019s the question of corporate QE. The Bank revealed details of its plans for buying \u00a310bn of corporate bonds through its new QE programme. Carney explained that to qualify, the companies would have to make a \u201cmaterial contribution to the UK economy\u201d. So many were shocked when the list included foreign-owned corporations with limited UK operations, such as Apple and AT&amp;T. It strikes many people as extraordinary that the Bank should be picking and choosing companies like this at all. David Blanchflower, a former MPC member, who was heading up Labour\u2019s review of the Bank described the Bank\u2019s corporate bond purchases as \u201cunmandated fiscal policy\u201d. It\u2019s becoming clear that monetary policy has impacts that are of enormous political significance, and it isn\u2019t being closely scrutinised by parliament. At a parliamentary debate on the effectiveness of quantitative easing on 15 September only eight MPs spoke. But more economists and politicians are waking up to the fact that you can\u2019t carry out monetary and fiscal policy operating in total isolation, and if we want to rebalance our economy away from housing bubbles and an oversized financial sector, then monetary policy needs a serious rethink. An idea that is gaining traction is that monetary and fiscal policy could work together to deliver \u201cmonetary financing\u201d. Under this proposal, new money would be created by the Bank as with QE, but instead would be spent into the economy by the government to boost investment, employment and incomes. It\u2019s an idea known as people\u2019s QE. This might sound radical, but currently, it\u2019s considered good if banks create money, regardless of whether they use it to lend to businesses or to blow up property bubbles. However, it\u2019s considered taboo if the central bank creates money to finance government spending for the real economy. It\u2019s time to break that taboo.",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group has been accused of a strategy of \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d after announcing another 1,340 job losses. The redundancies, which will affect staff in branches, are part of an ongoing programme of reductions by the bailed out bank\u2019s chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio. \u201cWe know the outlook for banks is tough due to record low interest rates, falling revenues and the changes in technology and customer behaviours. This \u2018death by a thousand cuts\u2019 approach does nothing to give confidence to those who will be staying with the business, trying their best to meet customers\u2019 needs and help to sustain the group for the future,\u201d said Ged Nichols, general secretary of the union Accord. Officials at Unite branded the job losses \u201chorrific\u201d. The latest cuts are part of the 9,000 reduction programme announced by Horta-Os\u00f3rio in 2014, and will have an impact on staff who work in Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland. The toll on jobs has been heavy at Lloyds since the 2008 rescue of HBOS. That takeover led to 45,000 jobs cuts, which was followed by Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s 9,000 cost cutting programme. He announced another 3,000 job cuts in July, in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. Unions hope the cuts announced on Wednesday can be achieved voluntarily. Nichols, who will be meeting Horta-Os\u00f3rio next month, said his members needed a vision of their future inside the bank. \u201cWe\u2019re deeply concerned that both the scale and the pace of job reductions are increasing,\u201d said Nichols. Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer said: \u201cThese announcements to staff across Lloyds Banking Group are horrific news for staff. 1,340 job losses within this taxpayer-backed institution are wholly unacceptable.\u201d The latest cuts come as the chancellor, Philip Hammond, prepares to sell the remaining 9% stake in Lloyds at a price below the 73.6p per share paid by taxpayers, taking 43% stake at the height of the banking crisis. Lloyds said: \u201cThis process involves taking difficult decisions, and we are committed to working through these changes in a careful and sensitive way. All affected employees have been briefed by their line manager today.\u201d The bank said it would aim to avoid compulsory redundancies. It said it was creating 110 new roles and argued the number of roles being lost was 1,230. Last week Hammond said he was abandoning plans to offer shares to the public \u2013 the plan outlined by his predecessor, George Osborne \u2013 and pressing on with selling shares on the stock market to major City investors. The shares are trading at 53p although the Treasury has insisted that it will not make a loss on the latest sell off as it has raised about \u00a316.9bn from previous sales. Banks are finding it more difficult to make profits because of the low interest rate environment which narrows the gap between what they can charge borrowers and need to pay savers.",

      "body": "<p>Lloyds Banking Group has been accused of a strategy of \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d after announcing another 1,340 job losses.</p> <p>The redundancies, which will affect staff in branches, are part of an ongoing programme of reductions by the bailed out bank\u2019s chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio.</p> <p>\u201cWe know the outlook for banks is tough due to record low interest rates, falling revenues and the changes in technology and customer behaviours. This \u2018death by a thousand cuts\u2019 approach does nothing to give confidence to those who will be staying with the business, trying their best to meet customers\u2019 needs and help to sustain the group for the future,\u201d said Ged Nichols, general secretary of the union Accord.</p> <p>Officials at Unite branded the job losses \u201chorrific\u201d. The latest cuts are part of the 9,000 reduction programme <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/28/lloyds-banking-group-axe-9000-jobs-200-branches\">announced by Horta-Os\u00f3rio in 2014</a>, and will have an impact on staff who work in Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The toll on jobs has been heavy at Lloyds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/18/marketturmoil.hbosbusiness\">since the 2008 rescue of HBOS</a>. That takeover led to 45,000 jobs cuts, which was followed by Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s 9,000 cost cutting programme. He announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/28/lloyds-bank-to-axe-3000-jobs-and-close-200-branches\">another 3,000 job cuts in July</a>, in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Unions hope the cuts announced on Wednesday can be achieved voluntarily. Nichols, who will be meeting Horta-Os\u00f3rio next month, said his members needed a vision of their future inside the bank. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re deeply concerned that both the scale and the pace of job reductions are increasing,\u201d said Nichols.</p> <p>Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer said: <strong>\u201c</strong>These announcements to staff across Lloyds Banking Group are horrific news for staff. 1,340 job losses within this taxpayer-backed institution are wholly unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p> The latest cuts come as the chancellor, Philip Hammond, prepares to sell the remaining 9% stake in Lloyds at a price below the 73.6p per share paid by taxpayers, taking 43% stake at the height of the banking crisis.</p> <p> Lloyds said: \u201cThis process involves taking difficult decisions, and we are committed to working through these changes in a careful and sensitive way. All affected employees have been briefed by their line manager today.\u201d The bank said it would aim to avoid compulsory redundancies. It said it was creating 110 new roles and argued the number of roles being lost was 1,230.</p> <p>Last week Hammond said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/07/philip-hammond-drops-plan-to-sell-cut-price-lloyds-shares-to-public\">he was abandoning plans to offer shares to the public</a> \u2013 the plan outlined by his predecessor, George Osborne \u2013 and pressing on with selling shares on the stock market to major City investors. The shares are trading at 53p although the Treasury has insisted that it will not make a loss on the latest sell off as it has raised about \u00a316.9bn from previous sales.</p> <p>Banks are finding it more difficult to make profits because of the low interest rate environment which narrows the gap between what they can charge borrowers and need to pay savers. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Confidence in the food and drink industry is increasingly fragile since the upheaval caused by the Brexit vote, a survey reveals on Wednesday, as the UK\u2019s largest manufacturing sector grapples with increasingly tough trading conditions. Despite sales climbing to their highest levels since 2013, three-quarters of Food and Drink Federation (FDF) members have reported soaring ingredient prices, plummeting product margins and concerns for the future raised by their EU workforce. This trend is expected by most companies to continue over the next year. Food and drink is by far the largest manufacturing sector in the UK, accounting for 16% of total manufacturing by turnover (\u00a383.7bn a year) and directly employing about 400,000 people across 6,620 businesses. The industry also supports 3.9m jobs across the \u00a3108bn UK food chain and contributes \u00a321.5bn of gross value added (GVA) to the British economy each year \u2013 nearly as much as the automotive and aerospace sectors put together. The FDF\u2019s UK-based members range from giant brands such as Coca-Cola, Britvic, McVitie\u2019s and Mr Kipling to small-scale producers such as the oatcake maker Maclean\u2019s Highland Bakery. The survey findings reflected the sentiment of a third of its full membership including micro, small, medium and large food and drink manufacturers, it said. More than two-thirds (69.5%) said they were less confident about the UK business environment while just 11% were more confident. However the survey coincides with the latest quarterly figures from UK retailers showing food sales at their highest levels since 2013, \u201csuggesting a disparity between business and consumer confidence levels\u201d, the FDF says. It is calling for an \u201cindustrial strategy partnership\u201d with government and for urgent assurances for the industry\u2019s workforce from the EU that they will have the right to remain in the UK. In the survey, almost three-quarters (71%) of companies employing EU staff say these employees have expressed concerns about the referendum outcome, with about one in 12 (8.7%) businesses reporting that their EU employees intend to leave the UK. An estimated 130,000 of the industry\u2019s 400,000 workforce are non-UK nationals \u2013 many from eastern Europe, often doing valued seasonal work in agriculture and factories. \u201cWe share government\u2019s view that we need to make the best of Brexit,\u201d said the FDF\u2019s director general Ian Wright. \u201cFood and drink industry confidence is low. Slower revenue growth, coupled with prolonged business uncertainty, is affecting the industry\u2019s ability to invest.\u201d The FDF is also calling for urgent action from the government to ensure that essential imports of ingredients and raw materials from the EU and EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA) countries do not face tariffs or costly non-tariff barriers. Some British-based businesses have benefited from the weaker pound, which makes their exports more competitive \u2013 as long as they still have tariff-free access to the single European market. A government spokesman said: \u201cLeaving the EU offers us an opportunity to forge a new role for ourselves in the world and we are determined to make sure the UK remains the best place in Europe to run and grow a business. As a nation, we\u2019ve sold over \u00a310 billion worth of food and drink overseas in the first six months of this year, and exports are up almost six per cent compared to 2015. We are building on that success and, through our Great British Food Unit, are working with industry to establish new trading relationships across the globe to help boost the sector.\u201d John Stevenson MP, chair of the all-party parliamentary group for food and drink manufacturing, which meets on Wednesday to discuss what Brexit means for the industry, added: \u201cGovernment and industry partnership has never been more important to the future of this vital sector. Food and drink is a national success story, with massive untapped opportunity to boost exports and improve its already impressive productivity performance, delivering even more for the UK economy.\u201d",

Some British-based businesses have benefited from the weaker pound, which makes their exports more competitive \u2013 as long as they still have tariff-free access to the single European market.</p> <p>A government spokesman said: \u201cLeaving the EU offers us an opportunity to forge a new role for ourselves in the world and we are determined to make sure the UK remains the best place in Europe to run and grow a business. As a nation, we\u2019ve sold over \u00a310 billion worth of food and drink overseas in the first six months of this year, and exports are up almost six per cent compared to 2015. We are building on that success and, through our Great British Food Unit, are working with industry to establish new trading relationships across the globe to help boost the sector.\u201d</p> <p>John Stevenson MP, chair of the all-party parliamentary group for food and drink manufacturing, which meets on Wednesday to discuss what Brexit means for the industry, added: \u201cGovernment and industry partnership has never been more important to the future of this vital sector. Food and drink is a national success story, with massive untapped opportunity to boost exports and improve its already impressive productivity performance, delivering even more for the UK economy.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Travellers at Heathrow and Gatwick are being offered \u201cabominable\u201d exchange rates of less than \u20ac1 to the pound as the Bank of England warned that sterling could fall even further. As shops and importers grapple with the increased cost of buying goods in sterling, holidaymakers and business travellers are being hit with some of the worst exchange rates in recent history. The pound was trading at about \u20ac1.11 on Tuesday but MoneyCorp exchange bureau in Gatwick was offering just \u20ac0.96 while Travelex in Heathrow was offering \u20ac1 for \u00a31, but less once commission and fees were taken out. Moneycorp in Southampton airport was offering \u20ac0.88 to the pound. \u201cNobody in their right mind should buy foreign currency at a bureau in an airport. It\u2019s abominable. It\u2019s a monumental, horrendous rip-off,\u201d said Martin Lewis, the founder of the consumer advice site MoneySavingExpert.com. Tracy Bownes, retail director at Moneycorp, said the reason for the airport rates was \u201cthe significant cost associated with operating there \u2013 from ground rent and additional security to the cost of staffing the bureaux for customers on early and late flights\u201d. Foreign currency retailers are exploiting the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the referendum on 23 June when \u00a31 bought \u20ac1.30. It means travellers are paying 23% more for goods and services sold in euros and a similar percentage more for goods sold in dollars, which have also rocketed against the pound since the referendum. The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents most of the large retailers, said these prices had yet to be passed on to the consumer, but it expected they would start feeding through in the first half of next year. However larger shops will do everything to absorb the extra cost as retailers are operating price deflation for the third year running, said the BRC. The Bank noted in September that some retailers were \u201cre-engineering products to maintain existing prices\u201d, meaning smaller packets and less expensive ingredients were being introduced in an attempt to avoid passing the increased costs on to the consumer. Steve Smith, the director of a fruit and vegetable importer in New Spitalfields Market in London, said this was already happening with small independent shops and farmers\u2019 markets barely able to cope. \u201cWhat we find in this game is there is a ceiling price for lots of goods,\u201d he said, explaining that shops and farmers\u2019 markets would do anything to avoid upping the price to the consumer. What they will do instead is keep the price the same but reduce the size of the product they are selling. \u201cTake a box of 48 oranges. Say we sell them for \u00a315, by the time they go on the street they are 31p an orange and the retailer will sell them for 50p,\u201d said Smith. \u201cBut when we start paying 50p an orange, the retailer can\u2019t afford that, so they will still buy a box for \u00a315, but it will have 88 oranges in it, ie the oranges that you buy will be smaller.\u201d At the other end of the supply chain, retailers say the collapse of sterling has affected their business. \u201cBrexit has been bad news for us,\u201d said Patricia Michelson, a cheese and wine importer who runs La Fromagerie shops in London. \u201cFor example, things like wine \u2013 we decided three weeks ago what price we would pay and that is now selling at a loss,\u201d said Michelson. She buys cheese from France, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy and will face an even bigger squeeze if her suppliers do not agree to hold their prices if, as predicted, sterling falls further. The pound picked up slightly on Wednesday but Tuesday\u2019s fall was its fourth in a row and sixth in the past seven days. The Bank rate setter, Michael Saunders, said on Tuesday he would not be surprised if it kept going. \u201cI know we voted for Brexit, but I\u2019m just worried about how it\u2019s going to affect my business. I love Theresa May. I think\u2019s she\u2019s an amazing woman, but I wish she would listen more to small businesses,\u201d Michelson said. Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst, predicts a massive shakeup in the retail sector, with small and large shops that are unable to absorb the import inflation going to the wall. \u201cRetail is hugely oversupplied and I was predicting a shakeout before Brexit. Now the fall in sterling means the screw is tightening and increasing the pressure,\u201d he said. He said retailers who try to reduce the size of products to mask increased costs were doomed. \u201cIt would be a very big mistake to underestimate the intelligence of the public. If you think putting fewer biscuits in a packet will work, you are insulting the intelligence of shoppers who will simply just go elsewhere,\u201d said Hyman.",

Shares in the company plunged 9% following the gloomy trading update. The maker of Bisto gravy and Angel Delight said sales in the 13 weeks to 1 October were 5.4% lower than a year ago at \u00a3172.5m, and trading profit is expected to be lower than last year. Sales of gravy and stocks fell 13% and desserts 9%. Gavin Darby, the chief executive, said: \u201cWe are disappointed that our grocery business reported materially lower sales in the quarter due to warmer weather, particularly in September.\u201d The company said its sweet treats businesses performed well over the period, with new products and business wins helping to drive sales up 6.4%. Premier said its Cadbury cake Amaze Bites were selling well in the first year. Sales in its international business rose by more than 13% in the second quarter, and Cadbury cake ranges were launched in the United Arab Emirates towards the end of the quarter. In the first half overall, sales fell 1.8%. The company said group sales were expected to grow between 1% and 2% in the full year, but it maintained its medium term target of 2-4% annual sales growth. Sales rose 0.6% in the last financial year to 2 April 2016. Darby said profit expectations for the full year were unchanged because costs were being managed carefully. \u201cWe remain very confident in our strategic progress, our customer relationships are strong and we have an extensive new product innovation programme planned for the balance of the year,\u201d he said. The US company McCormick abandoned a proposed takeover of Premier, which also makes Mr Kipling cakes, in April, saying that after inspecting the books it could not offer a price acceptable to Premier. McCormick, which makes Schwartz dried spices and sauces, made three approaches to buy Premier but was turned down each time. Premier Foods has however strengthened its ties with Nissin, a Japanese instant noodles company that has built a stake in the UK company. Premier is hoping to benefit from Nissin\u2019s strength in key markets such as the US, China and Brazil through co-operation on branding and distribution. It also hopes to boost sales of existing products by using Nissin\u2019s portfolio of patents to improve them. Commenting on the fall in Premier Foods\u2019 share price on Wednesday, Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cThe harsh reaction in the market reflects a lingering dissatisfaction over the deal that never was with McCormick. Premier Foods\u2019 collaboration with Nissin Foods has not delivered the goods and pressure will begin to mount on chief executive Gavin Darby if that continues over the holiday season.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As sterling recovers some of its recent heavy losses, leading shares have taken their cue from falls in overseas markets. The prospect of a full debate on Brexit as now promised by prime minister Theresa May has awakened hopes that a hard line in negotiations with the EU may be moderated, lifting the pound by more than 1% to $1.2272. But a disappointing start to the US results season in the shape of Alcoa pushed US markets lower, and this fed through to Asia and now Europe. There is also some caution ahead of the release of the latest Federal Reserve minutes later, which could give more clues as to the likelihood of a US rate rise this year. So the FTSE 100 has fallen 31.31 points to 7039.57, continuing the slide from its record intraday high on Tuesday. But airline shares are in demand, helped by news that Monarch has received a \u00a3165m lifeline to keep flying as well as an announcement that the UK and Chinese governments had agreed to increase weekly flights between the two countries. Sentiment in the sector was also helped by an upgrade of Deutsche Lufthansa by analysts at Kepler Cheuvreux. So easyJet has climbed 20.5p to 921p, as Cantor Fitzgerald issued a buy note after the budget\u2019s airline\u2019s bond issue. Analyst Robin Byde said: EasyJet has issued a new 2023 bond at an attractive low coupon rate. To us this suggests market confidence in its budget airline business model and balance sheet. It follows a tough 2016, in which exceptional events (e.g. terrorist acts and air traffic control strikes) cost the airline over \u00a3200m. The stock has been weak, underperforming the European airlines sector in the past quarter and is good value, trading on a calendar 2017 estimated PE of 9 times. This is a 30% discount to its long-run average PE. The dividend yield is 5%. We note that consensus forecasts for this year (2017) have fallen sharply and now suggest no growth year-on-year. If 2017 proves to be less turbulent there could be good upside to consensus. We view the current price as an attractive entry level point and reiterate buy, with a target price of 1,300p. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: It\u2019s been a while since easyJet was top of the FTSE leader board. At least a week. Today\u2019s gains come thanks to a welcome hat-trick of; 1) the pound regaining some poise versus the euro; 2) another successful \u20ac500m 7 year bond sale, and; 3) bargain hunters jumping on-board the current 8% bounce from an 850p level last traded in Jan 2013. British Airways owner International Airlines Group is also better, up 3.2p at 379.3p. Meanwhile InterContinental Hotels has climbed 26p to \u00a332.70 despite JP Morgan issuing an underweight recommendation with a price target of \u00a329.25, up from \u00a327.23. Among the fallers, Fresnillo has fallen 35p to \u00a316.12 on profit taking after it reported a 6.7% rise in silver production in the third quarter. Numis said the report was disappointing: Fresnillo\u2019s third quarter production results were a miss in terms of silver production (10.6Moz) but in line in terms of gold 219.8koz. The miss was driven by lower grade at the Fresnillo mine with the remedial programme that the company has taken at the operation taking longer than expected. Management have also pushed out the commissioning of the second phase new 10Moz/year San Julian mine back to the second quarter 2017 from 2016. We view these results as incrementally negative but move from a sell to a reduce on unchanged multiples of 2 times net asset value and 15 times cash flow following the pullback in the share price. Sports Direct International, which warned on Friday about the negative effects on its business of the slump in sterling, is down another 12.5p to 281p following the most recent decline, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 250. Cantor Fitzgerald cut its price target from 320p to 260p, saying: The news is obviously disappointing as not many forecasters would have predicted such further falls in sterling against the dollar. However, the company is not \u2018out of the woods\u2019 yet and faces further possible downgrades to earnings. It is also radically changing its strategy, which is not without risk. It will lead to an increase in debt levels eliminating the chances of a dividend increase and buyback in the medium term. In the meantime, the company will have difficulty in shrugging off its discount heritage; the currency led downgrade, in our view, represents a step down in profitability while the stock is now not \u2018stand-out\u2019 value on the basis of our revised forecasts, 13.7 times 2017 earnings forecasts. We are retaining our hold recommendation but downgrading our target price to 260p from 320p.",

Ericsson said efforts to cut costs were not enough to offset falling sales and lower margins over the period, adding that the negative trends were likely to continue in the short term. The company said it had brought forward its preliminary results for the third quarter when it realised figures would fall short of expectations. The full report will be published on 21 October. Sales fell 14% over the quarter to 51.1bn Swedish krona (\u00a34.7bn), and operating income fell to 300m Swedish krona (\u00a328m) from 1.5bn Swedish krona a year ago. Analysts were expecting sales of 53.6bn Swedish krona and income of 4.3bn Swedish krona. Ericsson said the fall in sales had been driven mainly by markets where the economic backdrop was weak, including Brazil, Russia, and the Middle East. Sales in Europe were also affected following the completion of mobile broadband projects in 2015, the company said. Jan Frykhammar, the president and chief executive, said: \u201cOur result is significantly lower than we expected, with a particularly weak end of the quarter, and deviates from what we previously have communicated regarding market development. \u201cContinued progress in our cost reduction programmes did not offset the lower sales and gross margin. More in-depth analysis remains to be done but current trends are expected to continue short-term. We will continue to drive the ongoing cost programme and implement further reductions in cost of sales to meet the lower sales volumes.\u201d Ericsson ousted its chief executive officer Hans Vestberg in July following a weak performance and last week revealed plans to cut 3,000 jobs in Sweden, amounting to almost fifth of its workforce in its home market.

      "bodyText": "Monarch Airlines has been granted an eleventh-hour reprieve after a \u00a3165m investment from its majority shareholder secured its future. The company had a deadline of midnight on Wednesday to prove to the UK airline industry regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), that it had sufficient funds to stay afloat. Without the cash injection from Greybull Capital, Monarch would have lost its Air Travel Organiser\u2019s Licence (Atol), which allows it to fly package holidaymakers. Andrew Swaffield, chief executive, said: \u201cIt is testament to the extensive effort by all parties, over the past weeks and months, that we are able to announce the largest investment in our 48-year history, as well as the renewal of our Atol licences. He said the investment gave Monarch a long-term future at a difficult time for the airline industry. \u201cWe believe the market will remain fairly challenging over the next couple of years, particularly because of terrorism and the weak pound. This capital injection allows us to face these markets with confidence,\u201d Swaffield added. A weak pound is generally bad for UK airlines \u2013 which pay for their fuel in dollars, and much of their navigation costs and ground charges in euros. Monarch is expected to roughly break even in the current financial year after making a \u00a319.2m pre-tax profit in 2015. Swaffield said the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote on 23 June had not dampened consumers\u2019 willingness to book foreign holidays. He said many of Monarch\u2019s customers owned properties in Europe, while holidaymakers opting for all-inclusive or half-board stays were partly shielded from currency fluctuations. Swaffield said Monarch was working to a six-year business plan and the equity investment gave the company \u201cmore than enough headroom\u201d to satisfy the regulator, as well as its own board and investors. Uncertainty over Monarch\u2019s future had hit holiday bookings over the past two weeks, he said, but airline bookings were not affected. He added that there were signs things were returning to normal and customers had sent messages of support for the business. The CAA had given Monarch a 12-day extension from the original deadline of 30 September to show it had sufficient funding. It renewed the company\u2019s Atol licences until the end of September 2017 after confirmation that it had met all the necessary requirements. The regulator said: \u201cMonarch\u2019s licences permit them to sell Atol-protected holidays until 30 September 2017, after which they will be required to obtain a new licence. \u201cThe CAA advises consumers to book Atol-protected air holidays to ensure they are protected in the event that their travel company stops trading. In these instances, Atol-protected consumers will be brought home if they are already abroad or receive a refund if yet to travel.\u201d In 2014, Monarch placed an order for 30 Boeing 737 MAX-8 aircraft, with options for a further 15 planes. The first of these aircraft is scheduled for for delivery in 2018. The airline said the new planes would give customers a better inflight experience while allowing the company to make significant operational cost savings. Monarch is based at Luton airport and employs about 2,888 people.",
