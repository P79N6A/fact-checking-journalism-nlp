    "webTitle": "BP dividend increase cheered by investors", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BP has rewarded \"very patient\" shareholders and pension funds buffeted by the group's travails in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster with a double-digit increase in its dividend. A week after announcing the $27bn (\u00a317bn) sale of its 50% stake in Russian business TNK-BP to the Kremlin-controlled Rosneft, the British oil group said it would increase its third-quarter dividend to 9\u00a2 a share \u2013 a rise of 12.5% \u2013 in a move that goes some way to reasserting BP's status in pension fund portfolios. At its height, the BP investor payout accounted for \u00a31 in every \u00a36 of FTSE 100 dividend payments. But even at 9\u00a2 it remains below its pre-Deepwater level of 14\u00a2 in 2010, after which it was suspended for three successive quarters until its reinstatement in early 2011 at half its previous level. BP shares closed 4.2% higher at 442.85p. The stock remains about 30% below the 658p level that it was trading at shortly before the world's worst offshore spill, which saw 4.9m barrels of oil gush into the Gulf of Mexico. BP's chief executive, Bob Dudley, said the dividend move was a reaction to the Rosneft deal, the development of new oil and gas prospects, and a post-Deepwater disposal programme that has nearly reached its $38bn target. \"We recognise that we have had some very patient shareholders. It is a combination of divestments, projects coming on stream and some clarity in Russia, that gave the board the confidence to reward our shareholders this quarter,\" he said. At 14\u00a2 a quarter the BP dividend contributed around $10bn a year to pension funds, with the new 9\u00a2 representing an annualised payment of about $6.8bn. The National Association of Pension Funds, which represents 1,300 schemes with assets totalling \u00a3900bn, said it welcomed the move. \"BP is a big company and a key holding for investors, so this rise in their dividend will be welcomed by many pension funds. It is also an encouraging indicator of the long-term health of the company,\" said David Paterson, head of corporate governance at the NAPF. BP's third-quarter underlying replacement profit of $5.2bn \u2013 a figure that strips out fluctuations in oil prices \u2013 beat forecasts by more than $1bn, but represented a decline of 5% on the same period last year due to a number of divestments made by BP over the past 12 months. Dudley added that BP was undaunted by a succession of bruising encounters with Russian geopolitics, which include Dudley's experience as boss of TNK-BP in 2008, when he was forced to quit after an \"orchestrated campaign of harassment\". Dudley said: \"We have always had a good relationship with Rosneft \u2026 there is a very clear commitment to create and build a modern and efficient, world-class company.\" BP will emerge from the TNK-BP deal with an 18.5% stake in Rosneft. Acknowledging BP's fractious relationship with TNK-BP's co-owners, a group of oligarchs called AAR, he added: \"The relationship seems to have run its course and BP did not want to leave Russia.\" BP said its results were boosted by a strong performance in its downstream business, driven by improved profitability at its refining units, while its upstream business \u2013 oil and gas production \u2013 produced a similar performance to the previous quarter. BP's US refineries have struggled for profitability in recent years but problems at rival refiners, including Exxon's Beaumont facility, helped boost profits over the past three months. In the wake of the Gulf of Mexico spill, which has cost BP $38.1bn so far, the group has outlined a 10-point strategy that includes developing more profitable oil and gas fields. With that target in mind, the majority of BP's significant new projects that are due to come into production by 2014 are in four areas: the Gulf of Mexico, Angola, Azerbaijan and the North Sea. \"All of these projects are on track,\" said BP. As part of its post-spill strategy to slim down the group and raised compensation funds, BP has divested $35bn worth of businesses including $11bn in disposals since the second quarter, led by its Texas City and Carson refineries in the US. BP said it will make a \"final\" payment of $860m into a $20bn Gulf of Mexico compensation fund. Excluding that $20bn fund, the group has paid out $15bn in compensation and clean-up costs so far. However, it is still negotiating a settlement with the US department of justice over criminal and civil offences. BP said: \"Whilst [BP] is ready to settle on reasonable terms, a number of unresolved issues remain and there is significant uncertainty as to whether an agreement will ultimately be reached.\" According to reports, the DoJ could be seeking a settlement of at least $18bn, while BP is holding out for $15bn.",

The stock remains about 30% below the 658p level that it was trading at shortly before the world's worst offshore spill, which saw 4.9m barrels of oil gush into the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>BP's chief executive, Bob Dudley, said the dividend move was a reaction to the Rosneft deal, the development of new oil and gas prospects, and a post-Deepwater disposal programme that has nearly reached its $38bn target.</p> <p>\"We recognise that we have had some very patient shareholders. It is a combination of divestments, projects coming on stream and some clarity in Russia, that gave the board the confidence to reward our shareholders this quarter,\" he said. At 14\u00a2 a quarter the BP dividend contributed around $10bn a year to pension funds, with the new 9\u00a2 representing an annualised payment of about $6.8bn.</p> <p>The National Association of Pension Funds, which represents 1,300 schemes with assets totalling \u00a3900bn, said it welcomed the move. \"BP is a big company and a key holding for investors, so this rise in their dividend will be welcomed by many pension funds. It is also an encouraging indicator of the long-term health of the company,\" said David Paterson, head of corporate governance at the NAPF.</p> <p>BP's third-quarter underlying replacement profit of $5.2bn \u2013 a figure that strips out fluctuations in oil prices \u2013 beat forecasts by more than $1bn, but represented a decline of 5% on the same period last year due to a number of divestments made by BP over the past 12 months.</p> <p>Dudley added that BP was undaunted by a succession of bruising encounters with Russian geopolitics, which include Dudley's experience as boss of TNK-BP in 2008, when he was forced to quit after an \"orchestrated campaign of harassment\". Dudley said: \"We have always had a good relationship with Rosneft&#xa0;\u2026 there is a very clear commitment to create and build a modern and efficient, world-class company.\" BP will emerge from the TNK-BP deal with an 18.5% stake in Rosneft. Acknowledging BP's fractious relationship with TNK-BP's co-owners, a group of oligarchs called AAR, he added: \"The relationship seems to have run its course and BP did not want to leave Russia.\"</p> <p>BP said its results were boosted by a strong performance in its downstream business, driven by improved profitability at its refining units, while its upstream business \u2013 oil and gas production \u2013 produced a similar performance to the previous quarter. BP's US refineries have struggled for profitability in recent years but problems at rival refiners, including Exxon's Beaumont facility, helped boost profits over the past three months. In the wake of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\" title=\"\">Gulf of Mexico spill</a>, which has cost BP $38.1bn so far, the group has outlined a 10-point strategy that includes developing more profitable oil and gas fields. With that target in mind, the majority of BP's significant new projects that are due to come into production by 2014 are in four areas: the Gulf of Mexico, Angola, Azerbaijan and the North Sea. \"All of these projects are on track,\" said BP.</p> <p>As part of its post-spill strategy to slim down the group and raised compensation funds, BP has divested $35bn worth of businesses including $11bn in disposals since the second quarter, led by its Texas City and Carson refineries in the US. BP said it will make a \"final\" payment of $860m into a $20bn Gulf of Mexico compensation fund. Excluding that $20bn fund, the group has paid out $15bn in compensation and clean-up costs so far. However, it is still negotiating a settlement with the US department of justice over criminal and civil offences. BP said: \"Whilst [BP] is ready to settle on reasonable terms, a number of unresolved issues remain and there is significant uncertainty as to whether an agreement will ultimately be reached.\" According to reports, the DoJ could be seeking a settlement of at least $18bn, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/30/bp-oil-spill-settlement-talks-stall\" title=\"\">while BP is holding out for $15bn</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Branston Pickle is being sold to a 200-year-old Japanese vinegar manufacturer for \u00a392.5m, in the latest deal involving an Asian food business and a British household brand. Branston will join Sarson's and Weetabix in foreign ownership once the deal with Mizkan Group is completed. It will be the second transaction between Mizkan and Premier this year after the Japanese company bought the Sarson's, Haywards pickled onion and Dufrais vinegar brands in June \u2013 a month after a Chinese firm bought a majority stake in Weetabix. Kazuhide Matazaemon Nakano VIII, Mizkan's chief executive, indicated that Branston and Sarson's have not been bought as potential entrants into the Japanese food market. Japan's industrial base has been hit by the high price of the yen and domestic manufacturers have targeted foreign expansion in a bid to keep costs down, as well as using their strong currency to pursue takeovers abroad. \"Branston Sweet Pickle is an iconic brand that has established a market leading position,\" said the Mizkan boss. \"The Branston brand is also an excellent strategic fit with our global portfolio and adds to our solid foundation for growth in the UK.\" The deal includes the Branston sweet pickle, ketchup, salad cream and mayonnaise brands as well as the company's factory at Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, which employs 365 people. Premier said it expected \"all employees\" to transfer to Mizkan once the deal is completed in early 2013. The deal means that Premier has exceeded its 2014 target of \u00a3330m in disposal proceeds more than a year ahead of schedule and puts less pressure on the group to sell other brands such as Angel Delight and Bird's custard. Premier had agreed the sales target with banks as part of a refinancing of its debt burden, which stood at \u00a31.4bn earlier in the year and will now be reduced to less than \u00a31bn. Michael Clarke, Premier's chief executive, who joined the group last year from Kraft, is focusing the business on eight \"power brands\" including Oxo, Batchelor's, Bisto, Ambrosia and Mr Kipling. Clarke signalled that Premier will now tackle its bread business, whose brands include Hovis and Mother's Pride but is facing industry-wide problems such as high wheat prices, significant logistics costs and aggressive supermarket pricing.

      "bodyText": "OK, time to round up the day: \u2022 Greece's prime minister has announced that Athens has reached a deal with its international lenders over its austerity package, after four months of talks. Antonis Samaras said Greece had secured the best deal possible, and warned of 'chaos' if the \u20ac13.5bn programme of cuts and tax rises was not passed. (see 13.14) \u2022 But members of Samaras's coalition do not share his views. The Pasok party has claimed that talks are still continuing, and accused Samaras of undermining Greece (see 17.49) . Democratic Left, the other junior coalition partner, is refusing to support the labour reform section of the package (see 13.41). \u2022 Spain's economy has continued to shrink. Data released this morning showed that Spanish GDP fell by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2012 (see 8.06am) Economists fear that the current quarter will be even worse, and warn that the Spanish economy is in a precarious state (see 8.45am). \u2022 German unemployment rose last month. The jobless total rose by 20,000 - more than expected. (See 9.12am) \u2022 Italy held a successful bond auction, with borrowing costs at their lowest since May 2011. Expects said that Silvio Berlusconi's threat to trigger an early election was being ignored.... (see 10.48am) \u2022 Argentina was put on negative ratings watch by Fitch. Move comes after Argentina lost a court case over how it repays debts which it defaulted on in 2002 (see 15.13). \u2022 The heads of the IMF, OECD, ILO, WTO, the World Bank and the German government warned that the crisis wasn't over. In a joint statement, they said the recovery was fragile and debt levels too high (see 17.21) That's it from me -- I'll be back bright(?) and early in the morning for another day of rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis. Until then, thankyou and goodnight! While Greek politicians spat, current and retired bank workers have been holding a rally in Athens. They are protesting against cuts to their pensions , which are part of the \u20ac13.5bn austerity package which has apparently been agreed with the Troika (according to prime minister Samaras, anyway). Here are a couple of photos from the scene earlier this evening: The situation in Greece is looking pretty worrying tonight. Greek socialist leader Evangelos Venizelos has been making alarming statements describing Greek Prime minister's Antonis Samaras' post-deal speech today (see 13.14) as \"unfortunate.\" Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Venizelos is insisting that the \"negotiations are continuing\" and has told his own parliamentary group that Samaras has spoken out of hand \"and undermined\" Greece's negotiating stance. The conservative-led coalition is clearly under immense strain with its very cohesion now at risk.... Venizelos's Pasok party is a junior member of Samaras's coalition, but with more MPs than Democratic Left (which is vowing to oppose some of the austerity package - see 13.34) The FT's Peter Spiegel just uploaded a document showing that the European Commission is making another bid to claw back Britain's EU budget rebate. Spiegel writes: What is clea is that the European Commission is going for the jugular. In an 8-page paper circulated by the Cypriot presidency last week.....the European Commission makes a direct attack on Britain\u2019s sacrosanct rebate, saying Britain\u2019s \u201cunique treatment\u2026.seems no longer warranted\u201d. More here: EU to UK: budget rebate \u201cno longer warranted\u201d. It's a long-running issue - in 2005 the then foreign-secretary Jack Straw resisted efforts to abolish the rebate. But with Britain leading the fight to peg back the EU budget, the gloves are off.... Over in Berlin tonight, German chancellor Angela Merkel and five leading figures from across the world economy have warned that the economic recovery is fragile, debt levels too high and confidence too low. This realistic assessment of the situation was issued in a joint statement from Merkel, IMF chief Christine Lagarde, OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurr\u00eda, WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy, ILO Director-General Guy Ryder, and World Bank President Jim Yong Kim. Here's a photo of them in action: The sextet met in Berlin today to discuss the state of the world economy. The statement is online here (in German), and there's an English translation here (although it's not Google's best work). It includes a pointed hint to the US to get itself onto a sustainable debt path, and warns that the\"muted outlook for growth\" is hitting consumer and investor confidence. Greek bank shares have suffered again today, with the sector closing down 5.3% after we learned that the Athens coalition is still split over its austerity programme. The main Athens index closed 0.5% lower, missing out on a general bounceback -- with the other main European indices finishing 1% to 1.4% higher. The chairman of Greece's privatisation agency has confirmed this afternoon that Athens hopes to raise rather less revenue through asset sales than planned. Takis Athanasopoulos told the Greek parliament that the new target is \u20ac11bn of asset sales by 2016, not \u20ac19bn by 2015 as previously expected. Even the \u20ac19bn figure was sharply lower than the \u20ac50bn target set last August, before the deep recession and spiraling fears of a Grexit scared potential buyers away. Antonis Samaras's warning that Greece face chaos unless MPs approve the \u20ac13.5bn austerity package (see 13.14) has caught the attention of the Wall Street Journal. Here's the WSJ's take: Greek Leader Warns of Chaos If Austerity Is Blocked Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras sent a stark message to his government's two junior coalition partners Tuesday, calling on them to back a \u20ac13.5 billion ($17.42 billion) austerity and reforms package or otherwise see the country being led into \"chaos.\" In a bid to end uncertainty over the austerity measures being demanded by Greece's international creditors in exchange for further aid, Mr. Samaras said talks on the cuts and tax increases have ended and that his government did the best it could. Kostas Vaxevanis, the Greek investigative journalist who was arrested on Sunday after publishing a list of more than 2,000 suspected tax dodgers, has written about his case for the Guardian today: Greece gave birth to democracy. Now it has been cast out by a powerful elite. Here's a flavour: A study of the Lagarde list is highly revealing. Publishers, businessmen, shipowners, the entire system of power is shown to have transferred money abroad. And this is information from only one bank. Meanwhile in Greece, people are going through dumpsters for food. Vaxevanis's case isn't the only issue fuelling concerns over the state of Greece. There is also anger that two TV news anchors saw their show axed yesterday after they discussed how the public order minister has vowed to sue the Guardian over our story on police brutality, but not yet acted on the threat. Other journalists have now called strike action in support of Kostas Arvanitis and Marilena Kasimi. Yiannis Baboulias writes about the case in the New Statesman today, and argues it is a sign that Greek democracy is unraveling: It should be plain to see by now that there is nothing pro-European about this government that was heavily backed by Greece\u2019s lenders in the June elections. If anything, it appears that in order for the painful, harsh and ultimately ineffective measures included in the Third Memorandum of Understanding between Greece and the Troika to be passed, silencing dissident voices was a must Here's the full article: It won\u2019t just be Greek journalists who suffer from free speech crackdown. Argentina has just been put on rating watch negative by Fitch, as the repercussions of its debt default rumble on. Fitch took the move (statement) after Argentina lost a court case last week over how much it must repay to investors who hold bonds on which it defaulted in 2002, and who are holding out for a better deal than the Argentine government has been prepared to pay. AP had the full details of the court case. The ruling underlines that it is very hard for a country to return to the international markets once it has defaulted on its debts, as Buenos Aires did a decade ago when it abandoned an austerity package imposed by the International Monetary Fund. Insurance against an Argentinian default is more costly than for any other country (if you discount Greece): News that the Greek austerity talks are over helped to keep European stock markets higher today, even though the coalition government is split. Here's the latest: FTSE 100: up 48 points at 5843, +0.84% German DAX: up 64 points at 7267, +0.89% French CAC: up 44 points at 3453, + 1.31% Spanish IBEX: up 83 points at 7812, + 1.1% Italian FTSE MIB: up 130 points at 15479, + 0.85% Greek AEX: up 3.5 points at 331.9, + 0.78% Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, flags up that many Greek MPs are deeply concerned about voting through the austerity package agreed with the Troika \u2013 even members of Antonis Samaras's own party. Helena writes: After a full four months of handwringing negotiations Greece has finally agreed to the arduous terms it must meet over the course of the next two years if the country is to keep international rescue funds pouring in. From vehement anti-austerity advocate prime minister Antonis Samaras has been forced to take the middle ground - telling Greeks in no uncertain terms today that the negotiated belt-tightening measures are the only way of assuring Athens' membership of the Euro zone and keeping chaos at bay. But the friction is palpable not least among his own coalition partners.The Democratic Left (Dimar) is still digging in its heals, refusing to endorse labour reforms it says will take the country back to the Middle Ages. [see 13.51] The Pasok socialist party has agreed to the measures but only begrudgingly. And even members of Samaras' New Democracy party are far from happy about voting through policies that all know will worsen a recession already in its fifth year and at a level not seen since the second world war. Much will depend on tomorrow's parliamentary vote on privatisations - widely seen as a test run of the vote on the new round of \u20ac13.5bn austerity measures. Once again Dimar and Pasok MPs are deeply unhappy with endorsing legislation that many feel strips the country of yet another level of sovereignty. How many vote it down could be indicative of which way the austerity package vote will go in the coming weeks. Here's the official statement from Greece's Democratic Left party, confirming it will vote against the labour reforms which are contained within the country's \u20ac13.5bn cuts package : The Democratic Left has fought on the issue of labour relations, to protect workers' rights which have been already weakened It does not agree with the result of the negotiations. The Democratic Left sticks to its position. That's via Reuters. The labour reforms on the table included cuts to the compensation paid to private-sector workers if they were laid off, and the abolition of automatic pay increases after three years of employment, according to reports from Greece. Syriza, the main opposition party, has also announced that it will vote against the Greek austerity package when it comes before parliament. Kathimerini, the Greek English-language paper, has the quotes: Greek TV is now reporting that Democratic Left, the junior partner in Antonis Samaras's government, \"does not agree\" with the results of the austerity negotiations which finally concluded this afternoon. If that's the case, then we're heading for a major political battle to get the measures through parliament. Democratic Left has been implacably opposed to some of the labour market reforms which the Troika has insisted on, while indicating that it supported other elements of the package. But without those reforms, Greece can't hit its target of \u20ac13.5bn of cuts. Yiannis Mouzakis, who blogs at http://theprodigalgreek.wordpress.com/ question's Antonis Samaras's argument that Athens achieved significant improvements through its lengthy negotiations with the troika. He points out that the scale of the austerity that will be heaped on Greeks has increased by billions of euros since the measures were originally mapped out after Greece's second bailout back in March. Greece's prime minister has just announced that the negotiations with the Troika over its \u20ac13.5bn aid package are complete. in the last few minutes, Antonis Samaras said his government had done everything possible in the negotiations with international lenders. Samaras added that Athens had achieved \"significant improvement\" in the deal on offer, and warned of \"chaos\" if the measures were rejected by MPs. Samaras made a clear plea to Greek politicians to back the unpopular measures: What would happen if the deal isn't passed and the country is led to chaos? Such dangers must be avoided. That is the responsibility of each party and every lawmaker individually. Here's some instant reaction from Twitter: The next step is for legislation to be brought to the Athens parliament.A draft budget is due to be presented on Wednesday. Samaras's fragile government had been split over the package, with junior coalition partner Democratic Left refusing to accept parts of the deal. It's not clear whether either side has made concessions today. Over in Lisbon, the Portuguese prime minister has urged his political opponents to work with him and help the country survive the eurozone crisis. Pedro Passos Coelho told parliament that it was essential that Portugal avoids a second bailout, and argued that only a \"general reform\" of the state would help it return to the financial markets and to growth. That means politicians from across the spectrum working together, and with unions and employers, said Passos Coelho, who has been buffeted by public anger over his austerity plans. Here's the key quote: Our problem is not just budgetary. There is a consensus in the country that we need to have a general reform of the state if we want to solve the crisis Passos Coelho was speaking during the opening of the debate on the 2013 State budget, which includes a tough package of tax rises and spending cutbacks. There is concern that Cyprus could run out of money to pay public workers salaries in December if it cannot agree a bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund soon. Reuters has the details, in a story headlined: Dithering Cyprus may have problems meeting December payroll: paper Cyprus may have difficulty paying public sector salaries in December unless a bailout deal is clinched and cleared by mid-November, a newspaper reported on Tuesday. Citing confidential minutes of a meeting in parliament, the Politis daily quoted Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly telling politicians he was worried Cyprus would be \"butchered\" if international lenders treated it in isolation from other euro zone states in need of financing. Meeting December's payroll commitments was contingent on the goodwill of bankers, he was quoted as saying. Troika officials have been negotiating in Nicosea for several weeks, but there is strong opposition against some of the austerity measures and labour market reforms being proposed. Over in Ireland, government ministers are in cheerier mood than their Spanish counterparts after a visit from Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, yesterday From Dublin, Henry McDonald reports: Before he left the Republic on Monday night the second most powerful man in the German cabinet delighted his Irish hosts by predicting that unlike other EU nations Ireland will not need a second bail out to keep the country's public services and finances running. \u201cI have every confidence that Ireland is on track,\" Sch\u00e4uble remarked beside the Irish finance minister Michael Noonan and the minister in charge of public expenditure, Brendan Howlin. Henry continues: Sch\u00e4uble insisted, drawing on recent IMF and EU reports, that the Republic would not need another multi-billion euro bailout. He also again held out hope that the Europe might help ease the burden of Irish banking debts accepting that \"Ireland is a special case.\" The positive noises emitting from a German Finance Minister about Ireland's ability to get back into the international markets to borrow has not however lifted the doom and gloom particularly over domestic demand, which remains in the doldrums and may take yet another major hit with the imposition of cuts to social welfare and increased taxes in the forthcoming December budget. Sch\u00e4uble also gave a speech in Oxford last night on the EU, called \u2018Europe \u2013 still a common vision?\u2019 , before returning to Berlin for talks with Pierre Moscovici today. (sorry, that Oxford speech isn't tonight as we said initially) Confidence in the euro economy among eurozone companies has slipped to a 38-month low this month, data released this morning showed. Economic sentiment fell in most countries including Germany (where unemployment is rising - see 9.12am). It did, however, rise slightly in Italy and Spain. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight commented: Eurozone economic sentiment sank further to a 38-month in October as it continued to be hit by ongoing major concerns about the current Eurozone economic situation and outlook. The head of Italy's Debt Management Agency has welcomed the result of today's bond auction (see 10.32am), saying the sale went \"very well\". Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, believes the auction shows investors aren't worried by Silvio Berlusconi's threat to withdraw his party's support from Mario Monti's administration. Nick Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy agreed, saying the promise of unlimited bond purchases by the ECB was helping Italy: Markets are taking the heightened political risk in Italy in their stride. For the time being, Mr Berlusconi's tirades against the Monti government are seen as little more than background noise. Annalisa Piazza of Newedge said there had been \"good demand\" for the five-year and 10-year bonds on sale. And Elisabeth Afseth of Investec argued that Italian politicians will be forced to address the scale of the challenges facing the country: There is a realisation that the situation is fairly serious and might have to be dealt with rather than playing internal politics too much. Silvio Berlusconi's threat to bring down the Italian government did not deter investors from buying Italy's debt at its auction of five and ten-year bonds this morning. The Italian Treasury raised a total of \u20ac7bn, at its lowest borrowing costs since May 2011. It sold \u20ac4bn of five-year bonds at average yields of 3.8%, down from 4.09% last month.... and \u20ac3bn of 10-year bonds at average yields of 4.92%, down from 5.24% in September. Reaction to follow! In the world of banking, UBS announced this morning that it is cutting 10,000 jobs. The Swiss bank is aiming to save 3.4bn Swiss francs (\u00a32.66bn) though a wide-ranging restructuring that will see its investment banking division shaken up and its fixed-income operations wound down, as UBS focuses on wealth management. Reuters is calling the move \"one of the biggest bonfires of finance jobs since the implosion of Lehman Brothers in 2008\". City insiders report that UBS employees affected by the cull received the news in a pretty blunt fashion - their office passes were apparently deactivated.... The FT's Alice Ross confirms that the mood is bleak inside the UBS offices today: France's finance minister has called for the introduction of some kind of debt mutualisation in the eurozone, but also admitted that the idea of full-blown eurobonds is not acceptable to the German government today. Speaking in Berlin this morning, finance minister Pierre Moscovici said: We are not talking any more about Eurobonds. I know it is a red line here in Germany, for some, the present government among them. What I mean is that we need to address together the debt issue, and this must be backed by all 17 members of the euro zone, in order to pool some short-term sovereign funding instruments to build a first step towards some kind of mutualisation of the debt. Germany's position is that debt mutualisation is not acceptable until there is closer economic and fiscal union within the euro region (otherwise, how can taxpayers in one country be expected to guarantee the debts of another?). Moscovici also played down concerns over Britain's future in the European Union, saying that the UK has always been a 'special case'. Here's some other highlights, via Bloomberg's Linda Yueh: German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble also spoke alongside Moscovici, and said he did not want to lose Britain from the EU. Estefania Ponte, an economist at Madrid-based broker Cortal Consors, supports our theory that the Spanish GDP data paints too rosy a picture (see 8.32): Ponte said (via Reuters): [The 0.3% contraction] does not mean the economy is doing better, but only shows the families have brought forward purchases ahead of the VAT hike. The German unemployment total has risen, as the core of the eurozone feels the impact of the crisis. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the number of jobless people in Germany rose by 20,000 in October, to 2.937m. That takes the unemployment rate to 6.9% - matching September's rate (which was revised higher this morning). In a statement, the Labour ministry said that the German labour market was \"in good shape\", despite economic challenges. Certainly in better shape than Spain, where one in four people are out of work. Germany's jobless rate is also stronger than the US (7.8%) and the UK (7.9%). Today's Spanish GDP data marks the start of a busy day. Here's what's on the agenda: \u2022 ECB president Mario Draghi speaking in Frankfurt: this morning \u2022 German unemployment: from 8.55am GMT \u2022 Italian debt auction: from 9am GMT / 10am CET \u2022 Eurozone consumer confidence: 10am GMT \u2022 Mario Monti at World Economic Forum in Rome: all day \u2022 US consumer confidence: 2pm GMT / 8am EST Megan Greene, eurozone crisis expert at Roubini Global Economics, says Spain is in a very troubling position. She predicts that Mariano Rajoy, Spain's prime minister, will request financial help within weeks, and is not convinced by the new 'bad bank' set up to handle the toxic debts in the Spanish banking system. Here's her analysis of today's economic data (see 08.06 onwards) Spain's GDP in Q3 came out very mildly less negative than expected (0.3% contraction vs expected 0.4%), but this hardly offsets a slew of worrisome indicators coming out of Spain recently: unemployment recently exceeded 25%, the regional bailout fund has essentially run out of cash, the new bad bank looks very similar to NAMA in Ireland (which most would claim was a disaster) and the nexus between banks and the sovereign will not be broken until the ECB is in place as an effective SSM [banking regulator] (presumably sometime in late 2013, though it could be later). (We covered the details of the bad bank at the end of yesterday's blog.) Greene continues: Without economic growth Spain's external and public debt positions are completely unsustainable. I expect Spain will be pushed into requesting official support by the end of this year. The reason today's Spanish GDP fall was less bad than expected (-0.3% not -0.4%) may be that Spaniards brought forward some spending to avoid this autumn's tax rise (such as the VAT rise). From Madrid, my colleague Giles Tremlett explains: The 0.3% drop in GDP hides a surge in consumer spending provoked by a sales tax hike introduced in September. Consumers bought big ticket items, like cars, before prices went up. Analysts believe this means that some of the pain expected in the third quarter has simply been deferred until the last quarter. The latest IMF report on Spain forecast a 1.3% drop in GDP during 2013, so there is no suggestion that its recession is bottoming out. Spanish inflation data was also released at 8am GMT, and showed that the cost of living is rising in Spain. Despite the recession, the consumer prices index rose to 3.5% year-on-year in October, from 3.4% the previous month. The CPI rise includes the impact of a hike in VAT in September, from 18% to 21% as part of Madrid's austerity package. The only good thing we can say about this morning's Spanish economic data is that the 0.3% decline in GDP in the last three months is slightly better than the 0.4% decline penciled in by economists. But the data still shows an economy steadily shrinking. Q3 2012: -0.3% Q2 2012: -0.4% Q1 2012: -0.4% Q4 2011: -0.3% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone debt crisis, and other key events in the world economy. Just in: Spain's economic downturn has deepened further. The National Statistics Institute just reported that Spanish GDP fell by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2012. On a year-on-year basis, Spain's economy is now 1.6% smaller than at te end of the third quarter of 2011. It's the latest economic blow to hit Spain in recent days. Retail sales tumbled by a jaw-dropping 10.6% year-on-year in September (see yesterday's blog), while unemployment hit 25% in the third quarter of 2012 (see last Friday). Spain's economy has now been shrinking for 12 months, and the recession is likely to continue for many more months - as the government's \u20ac60bn austerity package takes its toll.

    "webTitle": "Royal Mail adds 1,000 jobs at Parcelforce in flotation move", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Royal Mail is creating 1,000 jobs over the next four years through expansion of its Parcelforce business, as the group prepares to strengthen its appeal to investors ahead of a possible flotation in 2014. Parcelforce, which delivered 66m parcels last year on behalf of customers including Amazon, is building new depots and processing centres to cope with growth in online retailing, which is expected to account for a quarter of all retail spending by 2016. The Royal Mail said the \"vast majority\" of jobs will be full-time, representing a near-20% increase in its 5,300-strong workforce, with most roles related to delivering and collecting packages. Moya Greene, chief executive of the government-owned group, said the \u00a375m investment would help the Royal Mail become a more customer-focused company run on \"commercial lines\". She added: \"Our strategy is to convert the rise in parcel volumes into profitable growth.\" Parcelforce is in the division that runs the Royal Mail letters service, with the latter accounting for the majority of the unit's \u00a37.2bn in annual revenues. Profits are marginal, however, and the unit posted a surplus of just \u00a323m last year. The Communication Workers Union, which represents 140,000 Royal Mail employees, claimed that 10 times more workers have left the Royal Mail over the past two years than will be taken on by Parcelforce. Nonetheless, the CWU said the announcement might help those whose jobs are under threat elsewhere in the company. Dave Ward, CWU deputy general secretary, said: \"These jobs will go some way to easing the impact of jobs lost elsewhere in the company as huge changes are brought in to address the altering profile of mail.\" The investment includes a new parcel processing centre in Chorley, Lancashire, and two new depots in Cornwall and Hampshire. Royal Mail users gave a further glimpse of the company's future this month when they suggested replacing first and second class post with a single-class service that delivers mail over 48 hours. According to a consumer survey carried out by Ofcom, the postal regulator, nearly six out of seven households would prefer to have a single tier offering that is \"less expensive than first class, but delivered in two days\". While Parcelforce is hoping to capitalise on growth in the express parcel market, Ofcom said its findings showed there is a \"lesser need for speed in general\". But parcels remain an important part of the Royal Mail business, accounting for nearly half of the group's \u00a39.5bn turnover last year. Alongside the Parcelforce announcement, the Royal Mail has also launched a short-term hiring spree, advertising for 18,000 part-time staff to handle the Christmas post. Last year 110,000 people applied for the same number of positions, underlining the pressure on the employment market. A Royal Mail spokesman said: \"The recruitment programme began in September and there has already been strong interest. The 18,000 temporary positions will be helping to sort the festive mailbag at the busiest time of year for the Royal Mail and its customers.\"",
