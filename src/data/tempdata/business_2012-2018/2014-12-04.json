      "body": "<p>Less than 24 hours after the announcement that a grand jury would not indict officer Darren Wilson for the shooting death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown, Queen Greene stood on the border of Ferguson, Missouri, watching a man board up the shattered window of her beauty salon. A handful of women sat around her \u2013 mostly family and friends \u2013 to show their support. </p> <p>Greene, 35, is pregnant with her fourth child and had seven employees at the salon, which was destroyed in a fire as rioters swept through the city streets. Two of her former employees have already taken jobs elsewhere. She can\u2019t re-launch her business until she hears back from her insurance company, and worries her other employees will soon join them. \u201cThen I\u2019ll really be starting again from scratch,\u201d she says. </p> <p>She and her husband are approaching the holidays with trepidation. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much of a holiday we are going to have,\u201d Greene says. \u201cThis takes half of our income.\u201d </p> <p>Stories like Greene\u2019s are scattered across the Ferguson city limits. Every single one of the six businesses on Greene\u2019s block has been destroyed by fire, closed down until further notice. The beauty supply at the other end of her block is unrecognisable after it burned to the ground.</p> <p>Business owners and their employees in and around Ferguson are facing life-altering financial losses as a result of property damage to their storefronts from looting and burning that followed the Michael Brown decision. Donations and support have flooded in, they say. But it may not be enough. There is unfinished business here: internal rifts, anger, and the question of what will happen when the dust settles.</p> <p>At least 25 structures and 27 businesses in Ferguson and the adjacent areas were damaged by fire in the days following the news Darren Wilson would not be indicted, the Ferguson fire department confirmed Monday. Official figures have yet to be released. These numbers do not include structures damaged by means other than fire.<br></p> <p>But even those businesses that have not been damaged are facing heavy financial losses. One block away from Greene, all businesses but for one barber shop, which suffered fire damage and has closed, were left intact by the unrest. Owners say business was down by as much as 50% \u2013 on a steady decline since August.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c4efa292a5929ae3703df1dfca86c4f37c3aab1\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/4/1417714763809/6fca83c2-8893-4d94-8bc6-c5f2a8f30edd-277x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Ferguson church\" width=\"277\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People look in a window of the fire-damaged Flood Christian Church in Ferguson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One bar, which could easily have fitted 150, was open, but only serving two customers late afternoon on Saturday \u2013 and preparing for an early close. </p> <p>Linh Nguyen, the 39-year-old owner of a nail salon, says business was uncommonly slow for a weekend. Customers have become scarcer since the August shooting and initial unrest, Nguyen says. Her three employees have had their hours cut as a result, and one recently quit.</p> <p>A few doors down, Tymica Jones, 40, says all of her four hair salon employees have had to resort to finding part-time jobs outside of the industry in order to compensate for their slashed hours in the last four months. The holiday season will not be the same for her and her family this year, she says, adding it would be a great opportunity for her two nine-year-olds to be taught the value of things and restraint.</p> <p>\u201cWe are going to cut back this year. Things have changed,\u201d Jones says.</p> <p>Mike Marley is a 29-year-old barber who is using Jones\u2019 salon space after the barber shop he worked in was burned down. Business for him has dropped 40% since Michael Brown\u2019s death in August. Many of his regulars do not have his number or know where to find him. </p> <p>His personal income has fallen sharply. The father of two has been making \u201cbig time sacrifices\u201d to make rent and pay household bills, forfeiting expenses such as maintenance and weatherproofing his car, and furniture he needed for the house. He has also been forced to give up his passion: new shoes. He says cutting back is something he\u2019s happy to do so that he can still afford to treat his sons \u2013 who are 5 and 8 \u2013 on Christmas.</p> <p>\u201cI am not going to be able to give them everything that I want, but I\u2019ll focus on the main things. My oldest son wants a laptop for school. That\u2019s going to be the main thing I give,\u201d Marley says.</p> <p>Less visible Ferguson residents running moneymaking enterprises from their homes have also faced severe financial hardship in the last few months.</p> <p>Gloria Taylor, a 33-year-old mother of four, who runs a daycare from her home, lost three of her clients in the months following Michael Brown\u2019s shooting. Parents were worried for their children\u2019s safety. </p> <p>Last week, during the protests that swept the city, police sectioned off swaths of Ferguson. Taylor felt it immediately: not a single one of the remaining five or six children who attend her daycare showed up. </p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of income for us,\u201d says Taylor, whose husband, a chef at Longhorn, also lost income when his restaurant in nearby Florissant was temporarily closed for a few days after the unrest.</p> <p>Suddenly, Taylor is counting every cent. \u201cThirty or forty cents spent or saved on grocery shopping makes a difference,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a065a82cd7e7d3e7b66c697c5f6411ee3ef31674\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/4/1417714936573/afc3d135-520c-465c-89db-b826be89f354-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"ferguson Businesses\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers in Ferguson paint plywood with colorful messages of hope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The two Fergusons</h2> <p>There are two Fergusons. The city is 67% black and 29% white. While Taylor and Greene work in the part of town where minority-owned businesses stand, there is another, upscale Ferguson across the tracks.<br></p> <p>The more upscale Ferguson is the business district where business owners are mostly white. It\u2019s the part of town where the police station stands. Holiday decorations line the streets and a large, lit sign mounted above the main road reads, \u201cSeason\u2019s Greetings\u201d.</p> <p>This Ferguson is surviving while the other one suffers. The business owners are almost aggressively promoting a positive message for the town. Yet there are worries here too. </p> <p>\u201cDiversity is why I came here and diversity is why I stay,\u201d says Beth Thompson, who has been the owner of Cose Dolci, a boutique bakery known for its biscotti, for the last eight years. Her shop has been left intact, but she worries. </p> <p>Thompson, who employs four people, says support has been overwhelming in the last few months. New customers have compensated for those customers who have been lost due to fear. </p> <p>As a reporter interviews Thompson on the day before Thanksgiving, a man comes in and tells her that at the end of the day, he will buy up everything she hasn\u2019t sold and take it down the road to first responders.</p> <p>\u201cSo that you can have a fresh start after Thanksgiving,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes being the race that\u2019s on top \u2013 the Caucasians \u2013 you don\u2019t see everything that\u2019s going on with everybody at the bottom,\u201d says Cathy Jenkins, who co-owns the restaurant Cathy\u2019s Kitchen in the business district, and says she has very friendly relationships with white and black neighbours alike.</p> <p>Together with her husband, Jenkins is one of the only black business owners in the upscale part of town. She has been welcoming protesters in her establishment since August and sending food down to them when they are not able to make it in.</p> <p>Jenkins, who also owns a craft industry chemicals company based in Ferguson, agrees with the calls for change screamed out during demonstrations.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived in Ferguson almost 23 years and I have been stopped by the police in my twenties, thirties and forties. And each time I have been asked where I\u2019ve been going. But I live in Ferguson. I\u2019m going where I want to go. I\u2019ve never gotten a ticket and I have white neighbours. It\u2019s the authorities that have to catch up.\u201d</p> <p>Jenkins\u2019s solidarity did not go forgotten. Protesters during last week\u2019s night of devastation successfully locked arms in front of her store to stop looters from destroying it. The memory of this brings proud tears to her eyes. </p> <h2>Donations flood in</h2> <p>Such displays of generosity have buoyed business owners. An \u201cI love Ferguson\u201d initiative \u2013 selling t-shirts, yard signs, and stickers \u2013 began in August to promote a better image of the town. Proceeds raised from the registered 501c3 nonprofit all go to help local small businesses affected by the unrest.</p> <p>The movement has now morphed into a physical shop, which raised $15,000 between August and last week. The money has been divided up between 20 businesses, says Sandy Sansevere, a 55-year-old Ferguson retiree who volunteers in the shop.</p> <p>Since the big night of looting and burning on November 24, generosity has gone through the roof: checks have started flowing in for $2,000 and $10,000 each, Sansevere said.</p> <h2>Online donations</h2> <p>Many individual stores have resorted to online funding campaigns on <a href=\"http://gofundme.com\">gofundme.com</a>. </p> <p>Queen Greene, the salon owner expecting her fourth child, has already raised $10,000 out of a total goal of $19,000.</p> <p>Another business, Natalie Cakes and More, which was vandalised last week, has already raised upward of $260,000 \u2013 well over owner Natalie DuBose\u2019s target of $20,000. Donors are scattered across the country and world.</p> <p>Missouri governor Jay Nixon announced last Friday that $625,000 in zero-interest loans would be made available to small businesses affected by unrest through a Small Business Relief Program.<br></p> <p>But, even with such generosity, regional mobilisation and hope, internal rifts and anger \u2013 placed on protesters, looters or police, depending on perspectives \u2013 remain present. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b3dce58ff97a6ec30abc0db00378483d0e47815\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/4/1417714841520/fa243a0b-d4bb-4e56-83dd-aa5e77f38d68-327x420.jpeg\" alt=\"natalie\" width=\"327\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natalie DuBose weeps outside her store in Ferguson after vandals broke one of two large windows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Cohen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Two views on the past, separated by race</h2> <p>Many business owners in Ferguson can\u2019t let go of the feeling that the destruction could have been avoided if federal authorities had done more to protect residents during the unrest, which had been widely expected. <br></p> <p>Greene is adamant \u2013 as were most of the black business owners and black Ferguson residents I spoke to \u2013 that the extensive destruction that happened in Ferguson following St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch\u2019s announcement Darren Wilson would not be indicted, was yet another example of the failure of the state to protect black people\u2019s interests.</p> <p>\u201cI think the National Guard should have been there,\u201d Greene says. \u201cWhy was it everywhere else, except for in the heart of the problem?

Inside the \u201cI love Ferguson\u201d shop, volunteer Sandy Sansevere has another take, which stresses a united community with no race issues.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all good. And then you have a select group of people who choose to be divided. That\u2019s not how we live,\u201d Sansevere explains, echoing many white people\u2019s portrayal of the town. \u201cIf only we could keep the riff-raff out,\u201d she continues, referring to the looters.</p> <p>While \u201cI love Ferguson\u201d yard signs decorate many front lawns on the white side of Ferguson, they are rare sights on the black side.</p> <p>Indeed, there is a broad understanding within the black community that although supporting local businesses is a great venture, the \u201cI love Ferguson\u201d movement is seeking to promote an unrealistic image of a perfectly harmonious community. </p> <p>This portrayal does nothing to help with underlying issues and complaints from black residents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"826dac4ad83c1fa82b526e9c4b5a0a3420d77d0b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/4/1417715189299/4e64a850-2db5-463b-b95c-7de101f6b42a-460x303.jpeg\" alt=\"ferguson memorial\" width=\"460\" height=\"303\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eugene Gillis plays a trumpet at the Michael Brown memorial on November 29 2014 in Ferguson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Next steps</h2> <p>Residents say Ferguson is trying to rebuild and look to the future.

Clive Adamson, head of supervision, is preparing to quit days before the regulator publishes a report into events in March which led to \u00a36bn being wiped off the stock market value of insurance companies. The FCA refused to comment . The dramatic plunge in the shares of leading insurance companies followed a report in the Daily Telegraph which quoted Adamson. The report said the FCA was planning to review 30m policies going back decades and was considering scrapping policy exit fees. Six hours later the FCA clarified the scope of the inquiry into the treatment of long-standing customers, saying it would not look at 30m individual policies or at removing exit fees. The events infuriated George Osborne who wrote to the FCA\u2019s chairman, John Griffith-Jones, to tell him the regulator should consider disciplinary action against staff. The FCA commissioned an inquiry from lawyers at Clifford Chance, the findings of which are due to be published next week. Osborne set out seven questions to be answered, including who had authorised the briefing and \u201cwhere senior accountability should lie and what disciplinary action should be taken\u201d. Adamson\u2019s impending departure is said to be unconnected to the report by Clifford Chance partner Simon Davis. Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the regulator, has described the events in March as \u201cnot the FCA\u2019s finest hour\u201d. The FCA was also under pressure last night over another issue \u2013 the way it is handling compensation payments to customers mis-sold interest rates swaps by the banking industry.

    "webTitle": "ECB cuts eurozone growth forecasts and fails to deliver QE for Christmas", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank has cut its growth forecasts for the eurozone, piling on the gloom even as it failed to deliver an early Christmas present in the form of more stimulus. The ECB\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, said the governing council would reassess in early 2015 the policy measures it had already taken before deciding whether to try and breathe some life into the region\u2019s stagnating economy. Some investors were left disappointed that he did not announce a programme of full-blown quantitative easing (QE), where the central bank would buy government bonds to stave off a deflationary spiral. However, Draghi suggested he would not allow opposition from Germany, which has been a staunch opponent of QE in the eurozone, to stop a programme if it was considered necessary. \u201cDo we need to have unanimity to proceed on QE or can we have a majority? I think we don\u2019t need unanimity,\u201d he said, in what was interpreted as a strong signal to Germany\u2019s Bundesbank policymakers. Timo del Carpio, European economist at RBC Capital Markets, said \u201cChristmas has been delayed\u201d after the ECB\u2019s failure to announce QE. \u201cIn its final meeting of the year, the governing council failed to bestow any new holiday gifts for the euro area economy,\u201d he said. \u201c[They] did, however, manage to keep the prospect of further support in the New Year very much alive.\u201d Draghi said policymakers would wait before potentially changing \u201cthe size, the pace and the composition of our measures\u201d. The ECB cut its 2014 growth forecast for the eurozone to 0.8% from the 0.9% it was predicting three months ago. The downgrades were sharper for 2015 and 2016. Growth next year is expected to be 1%, down from the earlier forecast of 1.6%, while the 2016 forecast was cut to 1.5% from 1.9%. Draghi warned risks remained that growth would come in even weaker. \u201cIn particular, the weak euro area growth momentum, along with high geopolitical risks, has the potential to dampen confidence and especially private investment,\u201d he said. The ECB also lowered its inflation target following steep falls in the oil price with the annual rate expected to be just 1.6% even in 2016, still below its target of close to but below 2%. Eurozone inflation is currently just 0.3%. The next meeting of the governing council, on 22 January, could be a crucial point for the ECB as it updates the market on its policy decisions. Europe\u2019s major markets closed down yesterday after the central bank\u2019s failure to announce QE, including the FTSE 100 which fell by 0.5%. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: \u201cShares in Europe plummeted today alongside expectations of further ECB intervention after the central bank revised down its economic forecasts but nevertheless left interest rates unchanged and announced no extraordinary further policy action. \u201c[Mario Draghi] has been walking a tightrope of keeping expectations of quantitative easing alive while acknowledging that the governing council has not reached consensus that this is the best course of action to fulfil its mandate of price stability.\u201d Draghi and his colleagues on the central bank\u2019s governing council have announced various policy measures over the past years, including in effect charging banks to park money at the ECB by imposing a negative interest rate on deposits, in an attempt to encourage them to lend more to businesses and consumers. However, so far it has stopped short of full-blown QE despite mounting concerns over the eurozone\u2019s ability to shake off the crisis and begin a sustainable recovery. The UK and the US central banks have engaged in wide-scale QE programmes to help drag their economies out of crisis, and Draghi saidon Thursday: \u201cQE has been shown to be effective in the United States and UK.\u201d Dropping more hints he was in favour of the eurozone\u2019s own form of the measure, Draghi said hitting the ECB\u2019s inflation target remained the priority. \u201cWe have to remember that we have a mandate, and as I said before, we don\u2019t tolerate prolonged deviations from our mandate.\u201d Bank of England policymakers will closely watch any movement from the ECB in the new year, having persistently warned that a sluggish economy in the eurozone \u2013 Britain\u2019s largest trading partner \u2013 is among the major threats to the UK recovery.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "So, no festive cheer from the ECB today. Simply a dose of downgraded economic forecasts, which might be even worse once the slide in the oil price feeds through to consumers. Although Mario Draghi was as commanding as ever at his press conference, he couldn\u2019t cover up the fact that the Governing Council is not united about the prospect of embarking on a full-blooded quantitative easing programme. He might be able to talk the Council round, or simply override then, but today was a reminder that the road to QE is paved with pitfalls. And that sent the main European markets into the red tonight. Here\u2019s the closing prices: And the euro remains higher tonight, up almost 1% at $1.2381. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, reckons the ECB is close to launching QE, though: \u201cThe most significant part of the press conference was the official statement that the Governing Council would reassess the asset purchasing situation early in 2015. Markets now have a fairly firm timetable for when the ECB will need to admit that inflation is showing no signs of improvement.\u201cUnless a monetary miracle occurs and inflation improves drastically, by the time of the first Governing Council meetings next year, the ECB will have little choice but to act.\u201d Reminder, my summary of the press conference is here: ECB press conference: What we learned. Highlights start here. And analyst reaction starts here. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Cheers ,and goodnight. GW JP Morgan is concerned by the splits in the ECB\u2019s governing council. The tumble in the oil price over the last week could drive the eurozone inflation rate slightly below zero in the coming months, says Credit Agricole analyst Frederik Dukrozet. As flagged up earlier, the latest ECB staff forecasts were conducted before Opec launched a price war a week ago by not cutting production. Credit Agricole\u2019s updated inflation projections include \u201ca high risk of slightly negative\u201d harmonised eurozone inflation rates at the turn of the year, Frederik writes in a note to clients (online here). And here\u2019s the chart: Frederik also suggests eurozone inflation could be forecast to return to target in 2017, which would remove pressure for QE. In the medium-term, however, a decline in oil prices that is likely to be largely supply-led is supposed to have a net positive impact on growth, a \u201cmini-stimulus\u201d as Weidmann called it. Taking all the above elements into account, we suspect that the 2017 HICP projection, which will be included in the staff forecasts in March 2015, will be at around 1.7% or so. If the ECB has not launched sovereign QE by then, this kind of number would hardly help the doves to push their argument. Look how the euro spiked after the ECB failed to deliver the QE that some had expected: Christopher Vecchio, currency analyst at DailyFX, points out that traders must wait around six weeks for the next meeting: We now enter a long interim period between meetings, as the next one doesn\u2019t arrive until late-January (the ECB is switching to an eight meeting schedule in 2015), allowing plenty of time for the ECB to assess whether or not it needs to engage in more aggressive easing policies in order to stoke growth and inflation. If prolonged lower inflation continues \u2013 a realistic possibility given the downside pressure in energy prices \u2013 it\u2019s just a matter of when the ECB will succumb to a QE program This handy graph shows how the ECB\u2019s balance sheet has contracted since early 2012 (which was the time it showered the banking sector with hundreds of billions of euros in cheap loans): The German DAX had hit a new record high today, puffed up by QE hopes, before deflating as Draghi spoke. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says: Mario Draghi appeared a little wearier in his December press conference, perhaps already looking towards his Christmas holiday. The ECB President has been walking a tightrope of keeping expectations of quantitative easing alive while acknowledging that the governing council has not reached consensus that this is the best course of action to fulfil its mandate of price stability. The ECB will probably launch a full QE programme early next year, despite the opposition of some in the governing council, says Carsten Brzeski of ING. He\u2019s struck by \u201cthe inflationary number\u201d of times Draghi uttered the word \u201cQE\u201d at today\u2019s press conference, compared to previous ones. The scene is clearly set for QE. Draghi\u2019s comments during the Q&amp;A could hardly leave any doubt: the ECB is determined to start some kind of QE in 2015. Brzeski points to the fact that the ECB will look at the impact of falling oil prices - clearly deflationary, and the hardening-up of Draghi\u2019s opening statement: The slight change in tone that the ECB now \u201cintended\u201d and no longer \u201cexpected\u201d the current measures to reach the size of the balance sheet from 2012 was the last evidence of the ECB\u2019s determination. The euro continues to push higher too, up almost 1% at $1.243. Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, says Draghi was \u201cless dovish\u201d than traders had expected. The central bank did not announce any further liquidity measures and certainly didn\u2019t indicate any immediate intentions to implement full blown QE. It\u2019s a bit at odds with the most recent rhetoric and provides a boost to the euro, if only a temporary one. However, Edwards reckons QE is \u201cstill on the cards\u201d: It wouldn\u2019t surprising to see the ECB push the idea early next year, putting more pressure on the single currency. European stock markets have all fallen sharply since it became clear that the ECB was divided over launching fresh stimulus measures. The French CAC has fallen 1.4%, Germany\u2019s DAX is down 1%, while the Spanish and Italian indices are both down around 2%. The selloff began as Draghi admitted the governing council was not unanimous about \u201cintending\u201d to swell its balance sheet by another trillion euros. Alastair Winter, chief economist at Daniel Stewart &amp; Co, says investors got carried away with the idea that the ECB was bound to launch QE soon. There has been no evidence that the Bundesbank had softened its opposition to sovereign QE, in fact the contrary judging by recent coded messages. The markets had simply got ahead of themselves. Mr Draghi revealed there was plenty of discussion but no agreement, even on dates. Winter is also struck by Mario Draghi\u2019s declaration that QE is legal, and wouldn\u2019t need unanimous support: Draghi might prefer consensus but if necessary he may be planning to outvote the Bundesbank and then argue that the politicians in Berlin and jurists in Karlsruhe need not get involved. That would really raises the stakes in the his poker game with the Germans and they will surely counter him. As president Draghi heads off to swap presents and cards with the rest of the governing council (a lump of coal for Jens Weidmann?), let\u2019s quickly recap. 1) Not tonight, Mario. The European Central Bank has resisted launching a quantitative easing programme today, despite the weak eurozone economy. Instead, the governing council has decided to reasses the impact of its existing monetary stimulus measures in early 2015. It could potentially change \u201cthe size, the pace and the composition of our measures.\u201d So, we\u2019re a step closer to QE in the eurozone - but not there yet. Draghi told reporters that the ECB needs time to assess the impact of the tumbling oil price: \u201cThe changes that have taken place in the price of oil are so meaningful -- just think that between June and today, the price of oil decreased by 30 percent in euro terms -- they need careful assessment ... We have to assess the direct effect, the indirect effect and whether there are going be second-round effects\u201d 2) Cracks are appearing in the governing council.... The ECB has hardened up its desire to expand its balance sheet back to 2012 levels - taking it from \u20ac2trillion today back to \u20ac3trillion. But that decision was not unanimous; even some members of the executive council refused to back Draghi, he revealed. \u201cYes indeed, \u2018intended\u2019 is different from \u2018expected\u2019. It\u2019s not simply an expectation, it\u2019s an intention, it\u2019s not yet a target, it\u2019s something in between. It was the vast majority of the members of the Governing Council, but obviously it was not unanimous.\u201d 3) ....But that might not stop QE. Draghi insisted that the ECB could launch a new stimulus package without unanimity: \u201cIt\u2019s an important monetary policy measure, it can be designed, I believe, to have consensus. But we have to remember that we have a mandate, and as I said before, we don\u2019t tolerate prolonged deviations from our mandate.\u201d Draghi also rejected the notion that European treaties barred the ECB from buying government debt. 4) Anything but gold. The governing council considered a wide range of quantitative easing options, Draghi said. The only asset they didn\u2019t talk about was gold. 5) Europe\u2019s economy needs help. The ECB has cut its growth and inflation forecasts again. It now expects inflation to be just 1.6% in 2016, below target -- and that was before the oil price slide. It also cut its growth forecast for 2014 to just 0.8%, rising slightly to 1% in 2015 and 1.5% in 2016. That\u2019s down from 0.9% in 2014, 1.6% in 2015 and 1.9% in 2016 in the previous forecasts, three months ago. Draghi said the risks to the economic outlook remain on the downside: \u201cIn particular, the weak euro area growth momentum, along with high geopolitical risks, has the potential to dampen confidence and especially private investment.\u201d The press conference ends with Draghi slapping down the idea that a sovereign QE programme would be illegal. Not to pursue our mandate would be illegal, he replies. Draghi is asked about the rise of popularity of Syriza in Greece, and Podemos in Spain. He says he\u2019s not sure exactly what these parties want from the ECB. Would Draghi launch a QE programme even if a large minority of governing council members opposed it? It\u2019s pointless to discuss what kind of majority would be needed until we know what kind of programme is being considered, he replies. Isn\u2019t QE illegal under European law, which rules out financing a member state\u2019s debt? Draghi says that the ECB considered several kinds of QE, including buying sovereign debt. But that would be to meet its mandate, not to deliver monetary financing. That would not be acceptable, he smiles. Could an ECB QE programme include other currencies? Draghi says the ECB doesn\u2019t want to do that, as the exchange rate isn\u2019t a target (that would take us into the realm of Currency Wars). And was there unanimity within the ECB\u2019s executive board? No. That board consists of Mario Draghi, V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, along with Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 (France), Sabine Lautenschl\u00e4ger (Germany), Yves Mersch (Luxembourg) and Peter Praet (Belgium). The news that the ECB considered buying a wide range through quantitative easing (apart from gold!) has pulled the euro down a bit. What kind of assets did you discuss buying? US Treasuries, gold? My recollection is that we considered all assets, apart from gold, Draghi shoots back. Is there time to persuade Germany of the merits of QE before the ECB\u2019s March meeting? QE has worked in other countries, Draghi says. There is evidence that it could be effective. But the initial conditions in the US and UK when they started QE are different than in the eurozone today - that\u2019s another reason we haven\u2019t taken a decision today. He repeats that the ECB has a mandate -- to deliver inflation close to, but below, 2%. We would never fail to stick to that mandate. Would the ECB need a unanimous decision to launch a QE programme? No, says Draghi. It would be an important move, but we have a mandate to fulfill. [So, Germany couldn\u2019t block a QE programme on its own.] Up goes the euro, on the news that the ECB hasn\u2019t taken any decisions on QE. Draghi\u2019s vice-president V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio take the microphone. He says he was only expressing a \u201cpersonal view\u201d last week, when he said the ECB could launch full-blown QE in early 2015. He adds that the ECB faces a different challenge than other central banks when looking at sovereign QE, as it could potentially buy a range of government bonds. Why isn\u2019t the ECB taking fresh action now, rather than faffing around until 2015? (I paraphrase): Draghi concedes it\u2019s a fair question. The changes in the oil price are so big that the ECB needs to take time to assess its impact, both positive and negative. That\u2019s a reason to think more. Secondly, we have taken many significant decisions between June and September, and they haven\u2019t all had their full effect. So the Council will take a bit more time to assess. Here\u2019s the key section of Mario Draghi\u2019s statement: ....early next year the Governing Council will reassess the monetary stimulus achieved, the expansion of the balance sheet and the outlook for price developments. We will also evaluate the broader impact of recent oil price developments on medium-term inflation trends in the euro area. Should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation, the Governing Council remains unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate. This would imply altering early next year the size, pace and composition of our measures. In response to the request of the Governing Council, ECB staff and the relevant Eurosystem committees have stepped up the technical preparations for further measures, which could, if needed, be implemented in a timely manner. All of our monetary policy measures are geared towards underpinning the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations, in line with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2%, and contribute to a return of inflation rates towards that level. Draghi is reiterating that the ECB will reassess the situation in early 2015, and examine the impact that the fall in the oil price has had on inflation, and inflation expectations. The euro has strengthened since the press conference began - that suggests disappointment that Draghi hasn\u2019t made a firmer commitment to QE (as monetary easing should weaken the currency). A question about the ECB\u2019s new offer of low-cost credit to banks (the TLTROs). It is very difficult to see what the full take-up of the TLTRO will be, Draghi replies; the conditions of the second wave of loans will be the same as the first. Next question: What does Draghi think about EC president Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s new \u20ac310bn investment fund for European growth? Draghi says he supports it. It\u2019s the only plan of its type we have right now, and we have great confidence in its success. Blackstone also asks whether the ECB has hardened up its plan to expand the balance sheet to 2012 levels. Yes, Draghi replies - we have changed the phrasing from an \u201cexpected\u201d expansion to an \u201cintended one\u201d. That\u2019s a harder commitment. And there was a very big majority in favour of this, but it wasn\u2019t unanimous, he adds. Brian Blackstone of the WSJ asks whether the ECB could decide whether to take the plunge into full-blown QE in seven weeks (it\u2019s next meeting is in late January): On the first point, Draghi declines to say when the next decision will be taken. But he agrees that the ECB will have a lot of data to digest in January, including the slump in oil prices in the last week. The net impact of the oil price fall is unambiguously positive for Europe, he says. But it will also have an effect on inflation; especially if expectations of lower prices become embedded. The ECB thinks the weaker oil price could knock 0.4% off the harmonised inflation rate in 2014. But there will also be an impact on core inflation. Onto questions.... Draghi ends with his usual plea to eurozone governments to implement structural reforms, and to use all available scope for \u2018growth friendly fiscal policies\u201d. The ECB now expects eurozone GDP to rise by just 0.8% this year, 1.0% in 2015 and 1.5% in 2016. That\u2019s weak And it has cut its inflation forecasts in 2014 to just 0.5%, from 0.6%. The figure for 2015 has been slashed to just 0.7%, from 1.1%. In 2016, it rises to 1.3%, down from 1.4% in the previous staff forecasts. Draghi says the ECB\u2019s growth and inflation forecasts have been revised down substantially; and he admits that these forecasts do not include the latest slump in oil prices. So, the ECB won\u2019t launch a government bond-buying programme today, but it might come before the spring... Onto the ECB\u2019s new forecasts, and Draghi says the eurozone faces lower inflation and weaker GDP growth. He points to the fall in oil prices. There\u2019s a danger that weaker growth, and heightened geopolitical risks could hurt consumer confidence and deter private investment, he adds. Draghi says the governing council remains unanimous that it will take further measures, if necessary. INTERESTING. Draghi says that early next year the ECB will reassess the success of its existing stimulus programmes, and the impact of weak oil prices on the eurozone economy. The governing council could potentially change the size, scale and composition of its existing programmes. That\u2019s a hint that further stimulus measures could be agreed in early 2015 -- potentially including sovereign QE? Onto the prepared statement. Draghi confirms that the ECB has left rates unchanged. The ECB has started purchasing covered bonds and asset-backed securities he says (yes we know that). The ECB will continue taking measures in the months ahead -- which will have a \u201csizeable impact on balance sheet\u201d, and move it back to its level in early 2012 (when it was \u20ac3 trillion). Draghi begins by welcoming the press to the new HQ, a project that dates back to the creation of the single currency union. Mario Draghi has strode into the room, a few minutes behind schedule (for the second month running). This is the first press conference in the ECB\u2019s new headquarters. Here\u2019s a live feed of the ECB press conference - which I\u2019ve also tried to add to the top of the blog. The ECB press conference is one of the last set-piece events in the European economic calendar this year, so lets hope Mario Draghi is on his customary good form. Back in August, Mario Draghi identified inflation expectations as a key measure which the ECB would watch. This chart shows how they have fallen over the last four years, particularly in recent months. ING economist Carsten Brzeski says president Draghi will probably reiterate the ECB\u2019s determination to expand its balance sheet to the levels in 2012. That\u2019s an extra trillion euros (from \u20ac2trn today). All eyes will soon be on Frankfurt, says Daniel Sugarman, market strategist at ETX Capital: The markets will be watching events in Frankfurt closely...to see whether Mario Draghi will reveal any further details regarding Q.E measures to prevent another recession. The European Central Bank has voted to leave interest rates at their current record lows across the eurozone. That means the headline rate is pegged at just 0.05%; while banks are charged a negative rate of -0.2% to leave money with the ECB overnight. In 40 minutes we get the press conference, where Mario Draghi will be quizzed on issues such as QE, the state of the eurozone economy, the geopolitical situation, and more! Next up, the European Central Bank\u2019s announcement at 12.45pm GMT (1.45pm Frankfurt time). Again, the markets aren\u2019t expecting any change in monetary policy at today\u2019s meeting (but they\u2019ve been proved wrong before). The news should come 45 minutes later at Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference \u2013 which is always good value. Mark Miller, UK analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts further inaction from the Bank of England: \u201cThe current period of subdued inflation pressures is dictating the path of UK monetary policy and low inflation seems likely to persist as we head into early 2015. We do not envisage an interest rate increase until well into the second half of next year\u201d We must wait almost two weeks for the minutes of today\u2019s Bank of England meeting, to find out if the decision was unanimous. It probably wasn\u2019t; in recent months, the MPC has split 7-2, and November\u2019s minutes showed a range of views among the seven dovish members of the committee, suggesting some were close to voting to hike borrowing costs. To no-one\u2019s surprise, the Bank of England has left UK interest rates at their current record low of 0.5% again. There\u2019s also no change to its QE programme, and no statement. Move along, folks, there\u2019s nothing to see. European consumers are among the most pessimistic about their financial security, in another nudge to the ECB to consider fresh stimulus today. Out Datablog editor, Alberto Nardelli, reports that European countries makes up six of the bottom eight countries in the latest Ipsos financial security monitor, a monthly survey carried out in 24 countries around the world. The data also shows that UK consumers have become more confident over the last couple of years, overtaking the global average. Brits are now more confident than Germans about making a major purchase, Alberto says. More here: Europeans still feel insecure when it comes to their personal finances I missed this earlier; France\u2019s unemployment rate has reached its joint-highest level on record. The jobless rate hit 10.4% in the third quarter of this year, up from 10.1% in Q2. There\u2019s a danger that Mario Draghi could disappoint the markets today. Bonds could fall if the ECB chief doesn\u2019t give a hint, at least, that sovereign bond-buying programme is possible (even though it might not do much good) Scott Thiel of investment giant BlackRock fears German, Italian and Spanish bond prices have been driven too high by the prospect of a QE scheme. Thiel says (via Reuters): \u201cI don\u2019t find it an attractive market at all because it is going to be entirely dominated in the near term by the implementation of a QE programme.\u201d \u201cIf it does nothing but foreshadows the implementation without giving more details I would suggest the market is priced for that already.\u201d The euro is bobbing around its lowest level since August 2012 today, at $1.2315. Today\u2019s ECB meeting follows a flurry of disappointing economic data this week, points out Nicholas Ebisch, currency analyst for Caxton FX: The Eurozone is struggling with low inflation at the moment, and it is often even failing to match the already low expectations that are forecast. Overall Eurozone Services PMI yesterday was at the lowest level since January, and retail sales figures undershot expectations. As further interest rate cuts aren\u2019t really possible, there is more pressure on Mario Draghi to \u201ccommit to a firmer timeline for the expansion of ECB asset purchases in the early part of next year\u201d, Ebisch adds. European bonds are pretty calm today, with prices down slightly. That doesn\u2019t suggest investors suddenly expect a new ECB programme today: Prices are already at record highs, though, on predictions that the ECB will launch sovereign QE eventually. But would it actually do any good? Vincent Juvyns, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, says not: With German and French yields at 0.8% and 1.2%, and Spanish and Italian yields at 2.1% and 2.3%, one could question whether there is any conceivable benefit from buying sovereign debt. The political obstacles would be high, and Draghi could expend energy for limited reward in trying to surmount them. Juvyns reckons the ECB\u2019s current offer of cheap credit to banks may well work, if it\u2019s given time. A housekeeping note: this will be the first monthly press conference since the ECB moved to its new headquarters -- and it looks terribly swanky. Back to the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting. Aengus Collins, lead analyst on the eurozone at Economist Intelligence Unit, says a sovereign QE programme would be \u201ca political bridge too far\u201d. He agrees that the ECB is more likely to start buying corporate bonds first, as a less contentious way of pumping more cash into banks (in the hope they pass it on). He adds that the focus on the ECB underlines how Europe\u2019s political leaders are failing. \u201cHowever, the fact that sovereign QE now dominates debate is an indicator of how damagingly dysfunctional economic policy-making is in the single currency area. Mario Draghi is doing his utmost to fulfil the bank\u2019s de facto role as policy-maker of last resort, but with interest rates at the zero lower bound it is unreasonable to expect the ECB to get the euro zone economy up to escape velocity. \u201cThe recent announcement of a \u20ac3tn balance-sheet target was another helpful intervention from Mr Draghi, but it needs to be part of a much more concerted attempt to deliver a mix of fiscal, monetary and reforming policies appropriate to the dismally weak state of the bloc\u2019s economy. That is something only political leaders are in a position to provide. Thus far, they are failing lamentably.\u201d The Russian rouble has been fluctuating after president Vladimir Putin addressed the nation a few minutes ago. The rouble fell as Putin blamed Western governments for the Ukraine crisis, but rallied after he promised a string of business reforms, including an amnesty on capital returned to Russia from overseas and a freeze on some taxes. Putin also blamed speculators for the recent plunge in the rouble (down almost 40% this year). Paul Sonne, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Moscow correspondent, has tweeted the key points: UK car sales jumped 8% year-on-year in November, in the 33rd consecutive month of rising sales. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders credited rising consumer confidence in the UK; cheap credit, and the rise of deals where you effectively rent your new vehicle, are also factors, I think. SMMT also shows how demand for small cars, and \u2018multi-purpose\u2019 vehicles (four-wheel drive models) has risen in the last 15 years. Shares in Unilever have hit their highest level in a year, up 3%, after the consumer goods giant told investors it will spin off (churn?) its spreads business into a standalone unit. That includes kitchen staples such as Flora, Stork and I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Butter; fastFT reckons private equity might be licking their lips. Investors will be watching to see how dovish Mario Draghi performs this afternoon, and whether he makes any promises about future QE. So says Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale: The main event of the day is the ECB meeting, almost universally expected to see no policy move. Mario Draghi\u2019s final press conference of the year does afford an opportunity for him to go off piste however, something he has done before. Britain\u2019s house price continues to cool, according to the latest figures from the Halifax building society. Prices were up 8.2% annually, in the three months to November, down from 8.8% a month ago, and the 10.2% recorded in the quarter to July. The more volatile monthly data showed a rise of 0.4% during October itself. Perhaps the stamp duty shake-up announced yesterday, which will cut the tax on less expensive homes, will give the market another boost.... Back in the markets, shares in Ryanair have jumped almost 10% after it raised its profit forecast. The budget airline, which recently adopted a revolutionary policy of being nicer to its customers, reported a 22% increase in traffic in November. It now expects to make between \u20ac810m and \u20ac830m, up from \u20ac750m to \u20ac770m. Jamie Dimon, the boss of JPMorgan, has predicted that Europe\u2019s economic weakness will drag on for years. Speaking in Washington last night, Dimon warned that \u201cEurope is going to be tough,\u201d as political deadlock will hamper efforts to reform its economies. \u201cThey have all the same structural issues that you read about of other countries, but it\u2019s 17 nations -- and some of those structural issues have to be agreed upon in 17 parliaments and then by Brussels.\u201d All fine, except - of course- there are actually 18 members of the eurozone. I guess Dimon forgot that Latvia joined in January (either that, or he thinks Greece left!). Heads-up: our politics liveblogger Andrew Sparrow is tracking all the reaction to yesterday\u2019s autumn statement here: Autumn statement 2014 - reaction: Politics Live blog He\u2019ll be covering George Osborne on the Today Programme (due any moment), and the growing concerns about the scale of cuts in the next parliament: Bill Blain, chief fixed income strategist at brokerage firm Mint Partners, reckons that the Governing Council won\u2019t agree any dramatic new policies. He told clients: \u201cExpectations are diminishing for anything spectacular at the this week\u2019s meeting \u2013 except kicking that can down the road,\u201d However, that doesn\u2019t rule out fireworks from Mario Draghi in the subsequent press conference (1.30pm GMT). The actual decision on interest rates comes at 12.45pm GMT, but no change is expected -- rates are already at rock-bottom levels, and banks are being charged 0.2% to leave cash with the ECB. European stock markets are inching a little higher at the start of trading, as investors await central bank action this lunchtime. Mario Draghi\u2019s room for maneuver today is limited by the hawkish members of the governing council, who will argue that the current stimulus measures should be given a fair trial. So even though the new ECB staff forecasts on growth and inflation are likely to be disappointing, full-scale QE will probably be resisted. Nick Matthews, an economist at Nomura International Plc in London, predicts: There should be some response to the weaker outlook, and the middle-ground solution might be adding corporate bonds to the asset purchases. That keeps the prospect of quantitative easing alive still. That\u2019s taken from Reuters\u2019 preview. There\u2019s only a 5% chance of the ECB unveiling a full-blown government bond-buying programme today, says Chris Weston of IG. He also suggests it might announce plans to buy corporate bonds. This would increase the scope of assets the central bank can buy and, in turn, help them achieve a bigger balance sheet. Credit Agricole reckons the European Central Bank might drop some hints about a future sovereign QE programme at today\u2019s meeting. A formal announcement isn\u2019t expected; instead the ECB might start buying corporate bonds, expanding its current policy of buying asset-backed securities (bundles of debt). They say: \u201cWe will be looking at the exact wording of the introductory statement,\u201d \u201cIf the reference to sovereign debt purchases appears in the statement, then it would be the clearest sign that the ECB is ready to deliver sooner rather than later, probably with a comfortable majority.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today... it\u2019s the European Central Bank\u2019s monthly meeting in Frankfurt today, followed by the usual press conference with president Mario Draghi. With the eurozone economy weak, and inflation at a five-year low of 0.3%, some members of the governing council will be pushing for radical action. They want a full-blown quantitative easing programme, in which the ECB would buy up eurozone government debt. Draghi raised expectations himself last month, saying the ECB would raise inflation and inflation expectations \u201cas fast as possible.\u201d A move to full-blown QE today feels rather unlikely; hawkish members of the Council want to give the latest stimulus moves more time. Draghi could hint at a sovereign bond-buying programme early next year, though, and there might be disappointment if he doesn\u2019t. The ECB will also release its latest staff forecasts for growth and inflation. Also coming up: In the UK, the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee is also meeting, but no change in interest rates is expected. Economists and politicians will also be digesting yesterday\u2019s Autumn Statement, and the prospect of swingeing cuts in the next parliament. My colleague Larry Elliott has peered into the crystal ball, and sees: It is late 2019 and an election is looming. The Conservatives scraped a majority at the last election thanks to a timely boost to the housing market provided by George Osborne, who was rewarded for snatching victory from the jaws of defeat by succeeding David Cameron as prime minister. Osborne sits impassively in the Commons as his chancellor of the exchequer uses the last autumn statement of the 2015-20 parliament to boast that the government has met its manifesto pledge of balancing the books. So what does Britain look like in these circumstances? In terms of the size of the state, it is like the Britain of the 1930s. Public spending has fallen to below 35%, lower than the postwar low under Macmillan in the late 1950s and back to the pre-welfare-state years when Neville Chamberlain was starting a rearmament programme. Osborne is offering a return to the world of Ukip\u2019s dreams without the need to vote for Nigel Farage.... Autumn statement 2014: Osborne moves to cut spending to 1930s levels I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events of the day....",

It could potentially change \u201cthe size, the pace and the composition of our measures.\u201d</p> <p><strong>So, we\u2019re a step closer to QE in the eurozone - but not there yet.</strong></p> <p>Draghi told reporters that the ECB needs time to assess the impact of the tumbling oil price:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe changes that have taken place in the price of oil are so meaningful -- just think that between June and today, the price of oil decreased by 30 percent in euro terms -- they need careful assessment ... </p> <p>We have to assess the direct effect, the indirect effect and whether there are going be second-round effects\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>2) <strong>Cracks are appearing in the governing council</strong>....</p> <p>The ECB has hardened up its desire to expand its balance sheet back to 2012 levels - taking it from \u20ac2trillion today back to \u20ac3trillion. But that decision was not unanimous; even some members of the executive council refused to back Draghi, he revealed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cYes indeed, \u2018intended\u2019 is different from \u2018expected\u2019. It\u2019s not simply an expectation, it\u2019s an intention, it\u2019s not yet a target, it\u2019s something in between. It was the vast majority of the members of the Governing Council, but obviously it was not unanimous.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>3) ....<strong>But that might not stop QE.</strong> Draghi insisted that the ECB could launch a new stimulus package without unanimity: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an important monetary policy measure, it can be designed, I believe, to have consensus. But we have to remember that we have a mandate, and as I said before, we don\u2019t tolerate prolonged deviations from our mandate.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Draghi also rejected the notion that European treaties barred the ECB from buying government debt.</p> <p>4)<strong> Anything but gold</strong>. The governing council considered a wide range of quantitative easing options, Draghi said. The only asset they didn\u2019t talk about was gold.</p> <p>5) <strong>Europe\u2019s economy needs help</strong>. The ECB has cut its growth and inflation forecasts again.

If homes are left empty for longer than three months owners will face high court injunctions which if breached, could bring fines, repossession and, in the worst cases, jail for owners, the council said. The drastic action has been proposed as the north London borough revealed that 30% of a representative sample of 2,000 homes built in the last six years have nobody on the electoral register and, even when students and foreign tenants are discounted, close to a quarter of homes in five of the newest residential developments appear to be empty. Owners will have to prove they are not \u201cbuy-to-leave\u201d investors by showing up-to-date utility and council tax bills, evidence of deliveries, registration documents for health services, schools and social services, and even prove the homes are fully furnished. \u201cOur new proposals would make sure that all new homes in Islington are occupied \u2013 we want to send a message that \u2018buy-to-leave\u2019 is unacceptable,\u201d said Cllr James Murray, the council\u2019s executive member for housing. The proposal was warmly welcomed by campaigners against empty homes but is likely to be fiercely opposed by property developers. John Silvester, a former president of the Planning Officers Society, said such a use of the planning system was unprecedented and it might be challenged on the grounds that it seeks to curb established rights among property owners. The boom in investment in homes is being felt across the capital. Research consultancy Molior has found that in developments of more than 20 units in London, over 70% of new-build sales in the \u00a31,000-\u00a31,500 per square foot range were to investors, and over 50% in the \u00a3700 to \u00a31,000 per square foot range. It said some are \u201cheld as permanently available hotel suites\u201d by the owners. The draft measures will go out to consultation on Monday and represent the first time a council has tried to tackle buy-to-leave using planning powers. Under section 106 planning agreements set before properties are built, new homes would not be left unoccupied or unused for longer than three months, and would have to be occupied for at least 14 days in any three-month period. Developers selling the new homes would have to make clear in marketing brochures and advertising that the obligation would fall to the buyer. Owners would have to \u201cuse and occupy the individual dwellings as a dwelling house or to ensure such use and occupation\u201d. Generation Rent, the campaign group for more affordable rented homes, welcomed the initiative as giving first-time buyers a better chance of bidding successfully for new homes. \u201cTo people used to property as a speculative asset, this might seem harsh, but if you look at housing as something for people to live in there is no reason not to treat buy-to-leave punitively,\u201d said Seb Klier, Generation Rent\u2019s policy and campaigns manager. \u201cIf we are really serious about helping first-time buyers we have to take punitive action against those who see housing as an investment asset only.\u201d Islington is the most densely populated local authority area in the UK, according to the 2011 census. Under the London plan, the borough is required to ensure 12,641 homes are built between 2015 and 2025, and with very little land available, the council wants to ensure all homes contribute to meeting housing need. According to council research, as many as a third or more of homes in some new developments are potentially vacant. Of almost 2,000 units built in blocks in the borough since 2008, 30% have no registered voters and the percentage rises considerably when social housing is filtered out and market housing analysed. Of the 58 private apartments in the 1 Lambs Passage development, 71% had no voter registered, while 65% of the 106 in Worcester Point had no one registered. Even taking into account apartments where students are registered for council tax exemption, or the leaseholder appears to have let the property to a tenant who may not be eligible to vote, and cases where the flat is being operated as a serviced apartment, there are still high levels of unexplained non-registration. Forty-five per cent of the 127 market units in the Bezier building in the borough fall into that category, as do 33% in the Worcester Point building. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 December 2014 to clarify a reference to 2,000 homes built in Islington in the past six years. That was a representative sample of a total figure of more than 10,000.",

      "body": "<p>Just a few years ago, the US dollar was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Dangerfield\">the Rodney Dangerfield of currencies</a>: it couldn\u2019t get any respect. <br></p> <p>How times have changed. Mark this moment: America has actually done something right financially. The US dollar is a star, and it\u2019s because of billions of dollars of some of the most controversial stimulus programs in history.<br></p> <p> The dollar is surging in value while most of the world\u2019s major currencies are struggling \u2013 other nations, facing slower global economic growth, have tripped, had missteps or hesitations. Through early December, the dollar gained 11% versus the euro, and 13.2% versus the Japanese yen. <br></p> <p>It\u2019s not just currencies. The dollar represents the health of the US economy, and there\u2019s a big gap between the US and other nations in economic growth. The US is trending upward, while other major economies are slowing. After a slow start to 2014, US gross domestic product, or GDP, boomed 4.6% in the second quarter and 3.9% in the third quarter. <br></p> <p>That compares to two quarters of negative growth in Japan, inviting a recession and slow growth. Meanwhile, the Eurozone saw only minor blips of growth at 0.1% and 0.2% in the second and third quarter, respectively.</p> <p>\u201cEssentially, the US economy is the best-looking house in an ugly neighbourhood,\u201d said Ryan Sweet, director of research at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cEurope is a mess, Japan is in a recession, China is weakening and emerging markets are slowing.\u201d </p> <p>Who gets the credit?</p> <p> It goes to the much-maligned Federal Reserve, say some experts. Critics have leveled harsh criticism on the Federal Reserve in recent years for its unorthodox, aggressive, and wide-reaching monetary policies \u2013 from bailouts to cheap loans to billions in stimulus. There has been a Tea Party-driven \u201cend the Fed\u201d movement championed by former presidential candidate Ron Paul, who also wants the US to return to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/26/ron-paul-switzerland-gold-standard\"> backing the US dollar with gold</a>. There\u2019s also the lesser known but no less vocal \u201caudit the Fed\u201d movement, which posits that the central bank has meddled with the economy to disastrous results.</p> <p>But, contrarians say, you can\u2019t argue with results. Some experts are holding up US economic growth now as proof that the Fed did the right thing during the crisis. </p> <p>\u201cThe US economy is the best game in town because of the success of the Fed,\u201d said David Jones, president of DMJ Advisors, a Denver-based consultancy firm. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99ca2345971063dbfd11dd88274da58e1cfa4005\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/4/1417697500943/61c448cd-5b1b-463d-98c4-f76cd89aa10c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ben\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke: central bank activist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jones, who praised the Fed\u2019s \u201ccentral bank activism,\u201d gave credit to former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, who studied depression economies and advocated for early and plentiful stimulus during the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008. <br></p> <p>\u201cCentral bankers can do one thing that no one else can do: they can create money out of thin air,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBernanke dealt successfully with the crisis, and he should be given credit for it. Now, the dollar is strengthening, while the yen and the euro get weaker because they were slow to react,\u201d concluded Jones. <br></p> <p>Europe and Japan were late to Bernanke\u2019s controversial stimulus measure, quantitative easing, in which the Federal Reserve bought billions of dollars\u2019 worth of mortgage bonds and Treasury bonds to keep interest rates low. Low interest rates, in turn, were designed to spur spending and economic growth. <br></p> <p> Theoretically, quantitative easing also helped jumpstart the US economy through low, long-term interest rates, which in turn spurred consumer spending. Also, it provided a pop to mortgage refinancing activity, and overall helped improve business confidence. Finally, of course there is the wealth affect, as low rates forced investors into equities, and the subsequent stock market gains also increased consumer confidence.</p> <p>Other central banks have followed Bernanke\u2019s example. <br></p> <p>\u201cJapan is now in the process of more aggressive QE. They are using monetary policy following the Fed\u2019s example to boost the economy. It has depressed the Japanese yen and boosted their stock market, just like in the US,\u201d Jones added. </p> <p>What did US policymakers do right? And, are there lessons other advanced economies may want to heed? <br></p> <p>One thing, say experts, was moving fast on various kinds of stimulus measures, without even knowing if they could work.

      "bodyText": "Just a few years ago, the US dollar was the Rodney Dangerfield of currencies: it couldn\u2019t get any respect. How times have changed. Mark this moment: America has actually done something right financially. The US dollar is a star, and it\u2019s because of billions of dollars of some of the most controversial stimulus programs in history. The dollar is surging in value while most of the world\u2019s major currencies are struggling \u2013 other nations, facing slower global economic growth, have tripped, had missteps or hesitations. Through early December, the dollar gained 11% versus the euro, and 13.2% versus the Japanese yen. It\u2019s not just currencies. The dollar represents the health of the US economy, and there\u2019s a big gap between the US and other nations in economic growth. The US is trending upward, while other major economies are slowing. After a slow start to 2014, US gross domestic product, or GDP, boomed 4.6% in the second quarter and 3.9% in the third quarter. That compares to two quarters of negative growth in Japan, inviting a recession and slow growth. Meanwhile, the Eurozone saw only minor blips of growth at 0.1% and 0.2% in the second and third quarter, respectively. \u201cEssentially, the US economy is the best-looking house in an ugly neighbourhood,\u201d said Ryan Sweet, director of research at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cEurope is a mess, Japan is in a recession, China is weakening and emerging markets are slowing.\u201d Who gets the credit? It goes to the much-maligned Federal Reserve, say some experts. Critics have leveled harsh criticism on the Federal Reserve in recent years for its unorthodox, aggressive, and wide-reaching monetary policies \u2013 from bailouts to cheap loans to billions in stimulus. There has been a Tea Party-driven \u201cend the Fed\u201d movement championed by former presidential candidate Ron Paul, who also wants the US to return to backing the US dollar with gold. There\u2019s also the lesser known but no less vocal \u201caudit the Fed\u201d movement, which posits that the central bank has meddled with the economy to disastrous results. But, contrarians say, you can\u2019t argue with results. Some experts are holding up US economic growth now as proof that the Fed did the right thing during the crisis. \u201cThe US economy is the best game in town because of the success of the Fed,\u201d said David Jones, president of DMJ Advisors, a Denver-based consultancy firm. Jones, who praised the Fed\u2019s \u201ccentral bank activism,\u201d gave credit to former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, who studied depression economies and advocated for early and plentiful stimulus during the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008. \u201cCentral bankers can do one thing that no one else can do: they can create money out of thin air,\u201d he said. \u201cBernanke dealt successfully with the crisis, and he should be given credit for it. Now, the dollar is strengthening, while the yen and the euro get weaker because they were slow to react,\u201d concluded Jones. Europe and Japan were late to Bernanke\u2019s controversial stimulus measure, quantitative easing, in which the Federal Reserve bought billions of dollars\u2019 worth of mortgage bonds and Treasury bonds to keep interest rates low. Low interest rates, in turn, were designed to spur spending and economic growth. Theoretically, quantitative easing also helped jumpstart the US economy through low, long-term interest rates, which in turn spurred consumer spending. Also, it provided a pop to mortgage refinancing activity, and overall helped improve business confidence. Finally, of course there is the wealth affect, as low rates forced investors into equities, and the subsequent stock market gains also increased consumer confidence. Other central banks have followed Bernanke\u2019s example. \u201cJapan is now in the process of more aggressive QE. They are using monetary policy following the Fed\u2019s example to boost the economy. It has depressed the Japanese yen and boosted their stock market, just like in the US,\u201d Jones added. What did US policymakers do right? And, are there lessons other advanced economies may want to heed? One thing, say experts, was moving fast on various kinds of stimulus measures, without even knowing if they could work. Action beats inaction, say economists. \u201cAmerica used massive firepower early. Not only was it big, it came fast. That is why the US is looking good. Early and fast is better than late and little. Europe is late and little,\u201d said Cary Leahey, senior advisor to Decision Economics. That\u2019s not to underplay to risks of the Fed\u2019s move.

Thomson is seeking authorisation from the City regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority, and the Financial Conduct Authority to set up Atom as a digital bank without branches. Woodford is among investors, including former Goldman Sachs banker Jim O\u2019Neill, putting \u00a325m into the nascent business, which aims to capitalise on the increasing use of digital banking services. When Thomson announced in April that he was creating Atom, he said he intended to launch in the first half of 2015, though that date has been revised to the second half of the year. He has hired 70 people including Ed Twiddy, former head of regeneration agency the North East Local Enterprise Partnership, and Mark Mullen, former boss of HSBC\u2019s telephone bank First Bank. Based in Durham, Atom aims to offer a full banking service to personal and business customers, with a facility for paying in cash through the Post Office. Thomson has not applied for any local development grants, although he could do so when the business becomes too large for its current office space. He intends to employ 170 people before the launch. \u201cThe north-east has a great pool of very talented people,\u201d he said. In 2010, Metro Bank became the first new bank in more than a century to open on Britain\u2019s high streets. But Thomson is less a reliant on branches after figures point to the increasing adoption of digital services. Barclays is launching video banking while; Lloyds Banking Group is closing 200 branches as it introduces more digital technology. He is also attempting to use a new route for setting up banks, introduced by the government to encourage competition. Banks can be set up with less capital and raise more funds at a later date, which Thomson intends to do once the authorisation process is complete. Also making investments alongside Woodford\u2019s equity income fund are the venture capitalist Jon Moulton and businessman Sir Peter Vardy. Woodford quit Invesco Perpetual a year ago to set up his new venture. The fund can invest up to 10% in unquoted stocks. Paul Lamacraft, fund manager at Woodford Investment Management, said Atom should offer higher returns to shareholders and suffer from none of the legacy of misconduct has led to existing banks being hit with hefty fines. \u201cA number of challenger banks have entered the market to compete against the high street players but also to focus on more niche markets where margins are higher. We believe this opens up an opportunity. With no branch network, an outsourced infrastructure and no legacy issues, Atom bank\u2019s running costs should be significantly lower than the competition and this, we believe, could deliver higher returns to shareholders,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair shares have soared after it reported booming business and bumped up its annual profit forecast for the second time within a month, as the budget airline reaps the benefit of its more customer-friendly approach. The Irish carrier credited a 22% rise in passenger numbers to 6.35m in November to its \u201calways getting better\u201d strategy \u2013 Ryanair\u2019s official marketing speak for what chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary terms \u201cbeing nice\u201d. The airline has also attracted more customers with earlier bookings and sales drives for specific destinations in the first month of its expanded winter schedule, traditionally a quieter period. In the 12 months to November, passenger numbers rose 5% to 85.4m. Ryanair now expects just over 90m customers to travel with it over the year. While the airline previously grounded many aircraft over the winter, this year it has managed to fill 88% of seats even with more planes flying. Ryanair shares jumped 9% to \u20ac9.52 on the news. O\u2019Leary declared last month that the new approach was \u201cworking like a dream\u201d, after the carrier decided in late 2013 to transform its customer service and stop \u201cunnecessarily pissing people off\u201d. Ryanair has scrapped a lot of unpopular policies, allowing more carry-on baggage, allocating seating and cutting punitive charges. Complaints to Ryanair were down 40% to 80,000 letters a year, O\u2019Leary said last month. Ryanair raised its forecast for profits after tax this year to between \u20ac810m and \u20ac830m (\u00a3636m-\u00a3655m), up from last month\u2019s already upgraded estimate of \u20ac750m-\u20ac770m. Last year\u2019s figure was \u20ac523m. In the first half of this year, it made \u20ac795m. The company said it had beaten its load factor targets across a number of destinations where it is offering new business-friendly flights in competition with longer established airlines. Ryanair has been wooing passengers travelling on business by listing new flexible fares on third-party booking sites and establishing busier schedules to more centrally located airports. It launched a number of paired-city routes to appeal to business customers, such as Warsaw to Gdansk in Poland, and its three-times-a-day services from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London Stansted. Ryanair\u2019s relentless ascent has seen the carrier order 200 more Boeing 737 Max aircraft with a long-term goal of boosting passenger numbers to 150m by the middle of the next decade. The airline is looking to expand its short-haul operations in south-east Europe and into the Middle East, and has become more optimistic about the potential goal of low-cost long-haul flights, with its cash reserves and the development of more fuel-efficient planes opening up transatlantic routes. While the airline\u2019s management has never been shy in its public promotion or strategic expansion, the City consensus is that Ryanair tends to err on the side of caution with its profit forecasts. Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said he would not rule out a further improvement. \u201cIt remains to be seen to what degree the stronger short-term performance represents faster progress towards the same long-term outcome, or an improved outlook across the board. Ryanair is rapidly closing in on easyJet\u2019s load factors (about 90%) and the rate of improvement is likely to moderate.\u201d",

Barratt and Taylor Wimpey are set to join the FTSE 100 later this month.</p> <p>The sector was also helped by some positive analyst notes. UBS said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We remain positive on the UK housebuilders with a potential total return potential on a 12 month view of around 20% on average. After a somewhat choppy second quarter, the sector has rebounded strongly in the second half as rate rise expectations have been pushed out, bringing total return outperformance versus the FTSE Allshare to 14% year to date.

      "bodyText": "As the Bank of England leaves interest rates unchanged once more, housebuilders continue to make good gains in the wake of the autumn statement. Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s move to cut stamp duty on properties below \u00a3937,000 will give another boost to house prices although top end buyers will have to pay more. So Persimmon has put on 50p to \u00a315.90, Crest Nicholson has climbed 12.8p to 372.5p, Redrow has risen 10.2p to 291.3p, Bellway has added 66p to \u00a319.26, Taylor Wimpey is up 4.7p at 137.2p and Barratt Developments is 14.8p better at 473.7p. Barratt and Taylor Wimpey are set to join the FTSE 100 later this month. The sector was also helped by some positive analyst notes. UBS said: We remain positive on the UK housebuilders with a potential total return potential on a 12 month view of around 20% on average. After a somewhat choppy second quarter, the sector has rebounded strongly in the second half as rate rise expectations have been pushed out, bringing total return outperformance versus the FTSE Allshare to 14% year to date. This should make 2014 the 4th consecutive year of significant outperformance of the sector. The key positive fundamentals for the sector remain unchanged: (1) limited competition for land resulting in attractive rates of return on new developments; (2) supportive policy environment with both political parties supporting housebuilding, including Help to Buy (Stamp Duty reform is another signal of this); (3) generally good levels of affordability (although deteriorating somewhat) given historical low interest rates.

Real growth is weak; nominal growth is pathetic</strong></h2> <p>In seasonally adjusted terms, the economy grew by just 0.3% in the September quarter, and by 2.7% in the past year.

Thus any growth we achieved this last quarter came about through population increase. </p> <p>For the budget numbers, the focus always goes onto nominal growth. Measured in current dollars, it gives a better link to taxation revenue than real GDP. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.budget.gov.au/2014-15/content/bp1/html/bp1_bst2-01.htm\">May budget</a> forecast nominal GDP in 2014-15 to grow by 3%.

So yeah, all gloom.</p> <h2><strong>2. Falling prices mean there is little benefit from rising exports </strong></h2> <p>The small growth had to come from somewhere and where it mostly came from was exports. After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/sep/05/australias-gdp-risen-six-things\">last quarter\u2019s</a> stumble, annual growth in exports recovered to 7.1% seasonally adjusted:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 2\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/1G3HG/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And because the rise in imports was muted (they even fell in seasonally adjusted terms), net exports grew strongly and contributed 0.8 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/0jhoW/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But while exports are doing well, the price of exports is falling. </p> <p>The terms of trade \u2013 which measures the price of our exports compared to our imports \u2013 fell 3% in trend terms in the past quarter alone and 9.1% in the past year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/AzVW9/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The fall in terms of trade means less income for our exports and flows through into less income for the nation as a whole.

This occurred again from 2010 to 2012.

Private investment is down; and public investment is not replacing it. </strong></h2> <p>In his press conference on Wednesday, Joe Hockey said that the figures confirmed \u201cthe necessity for the delivery of our plan to significantly increase infrastructure spending over the next few years\u201d.</p> <p>Certainly much has been made in the past two years how Tony Abbott was determined to be the \u201cinfrastructure prime minister\u201d.

During the GFC, when private investment fell to such an extent it was detracting 0.9% points from annual GDP growth, public investment spending filled the gap. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 8\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/pzGj9/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But in the past year, not only has private infrastructure investment detracted from GDP growth, so too has public infrastructure spending. </p> <p>This puts the Victorian election result into the economic mix.

Oh. Goody. </p> <h2><strong>5. NSW has the demand. WA has none. </strong></h2> <p>As noted last week when looking at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/nov/25/victorias-poor-economic-results-is-it-too-late-for-denis-napthine\">state accounts</a>, Western Australia\u2019s economic growth is coming pretty much all from exports. It means that while its economy is growing, demand (a measure of consumption and investment) is falling. In WA, household consumption grew by just 0.5% in the September quarter, but private capital expenditure fell by 4.7%. It led to annual state final demand in WA falling for the sixth quarter in a row:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 9\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/nZWkm/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>By contrast, state final demand in New South Wales increased by 4% over the past year, driven by a 3.9% increase in household consumption and a 16% increase in dwelling construction. The biggest driver of household consumption in NSW was money spent on hotels, cafes and restaurants \u2013 contributing 0.9 percentage points to that 3.9% growth. </p> <p>Queensland, like WA, continued to see its final demand fall with the small rise in household consumption unable to cover the large falls in capital expenditure.</p> <p>What it means is that while the state accounts showed that, although WA continues to power the Australian economy by including exports, when we just look at state final demand, NSW is the powerhouse and WA is actually detracting from GDP growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 10\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/E8nld/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>All of which highlights just how different the mining boom is now that it\u2019s all about exports and not investment \u2013 and alas with prices down the profits and thus tax revenue (for both the Australian and WA governments) isn\u2019t as much as hoped. </p> <p>So no, not much sunshine to be felt. </p> <h2><strong>6. Labour is still productive, but the gains are slowing just a tad. </strong></h2> <p>As noted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/dec/01/budget-deficit-to-be-blamed-on-terms-of-trade\">on Monday</a>, unless labour productivity grows by 1.5% each year, the budget is going to take a pretty big hit over the next 10 years \u2013 and so will our standard of living. </p> <p>In the past year the standard measure of labour productivity, GDP per hour worked, grew by 2.2% in trend terms \u2013 an increase from 1.9% growth in the June quarter. This suggests all is well. And while that is good, my preferred measure of gross value added per hour worked market sector, which focuses more on productivity in the private sector grew by just 1.9% in the past year \u2013 a very slight fall from the 2.0% in the 12 months to June:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 11\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/fM10w/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But when we look at annual average growth over the past five years, there does seem to be a bit of a drop off. This time last year, the five-year annual average growth was 2.45%, now it is 2.2%. Nothing to get too panicky about, but one to watch. </p> <p>Similarly, labour costs suggest a slight levelling off in our competitiveness.</p> <p>Labour costs in the non-farm parts of the economy rose 0.4% in the past quarter accounting for inflation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 12\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/SAd4r/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But while the slight rise in real-unit labour costs in the past nine months would suggest a decrease in Australia competitiveness, this is mostly due to the very low inflation measure used to calculate the real GDP figures. </p> <p>According to the GDP figures, in the September quarter prices actually fell 0.4% in the September quarter and didn\u2019t grow at all over the past 12 months. </p> <p>And when you have 0% inflation that means any rise in wages will see an increase in \u201creal labour costs\u201d but that doesn\u2019t meant they are spiralling out of control. Indeed, as we know from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/nov/18/slow-wage-rises-show-australias-industrial-relations-system-is-working\">wages price index</a> figures from two weeks ago that wage growth is the lowest its ever been. </p> <p>This is also reflected in the growth of nominal labour costs \u2013 which the RBA keeps an eye on to look at inflation concerns. They actually fell in the past year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 13\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/DkwAT/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So I guess if you\u2019re looking for a sunny note to end on let us just say the workers are still working pretty hard and well, but we\u2019re not getting any extra pay for doing so and our income feels like it has gone backwards. </p> <p>Yeah. Gloomy. </p>",

Let\u2019s break down the figures and to see if there is any sunshine amid the gloom. 1. Real growth is weak; nominal growth is pathetic In seasonally adjusted terms, the economy grew by just 0.3% in the September quarter, and by 2.7% in the past year.

Nominal GDP in the past quarter grew by just 0.2% in trend terms and actually fell by 0.1% in seasonally adjusted terms. All in all this suggests a fairly big hit to the budget bottom line. So yeah, all gloom. 2. Falling prices mean there is little benefit from rising exports The small growth had to come from somewhere and where it mostly came from was exports. After last quarter\u2019s stumble, annual growth in exports recovered to 7.1% seasonally adjusted: And because the rise in imports was muted (they even fell in seasonally adjusted terms), net exports grew strongly and contributed 0.8 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth. But while exports are doing well, the price of exports is falling. The terms of trade \u2013 which measures the price of our exports compared to our imports \u2013 fell 3% in trend terms in the past quarter alone and 9.1% in the past year: The fall in terms of trade means less income for our exports and flows through into less income for the nation as a whole. Thus, while GDP grew and GDP per capita grew in the past year, real net national disposable income per capita fell: It suggests that despite exports leading to a growing economy, we\u2019re not seeing any benefits in growing income. So, pretty gloomy still. 3. Investment might be down,. but mining remains strong The figures also once again highlight that the mining sector continues to be the strongest sector of the economy. But they also highlight how much differently the mining sector contributes to the growth of the economy.

Private investment is down; and public investment is not replacing it. In his press conference on Wednesday, Joe Hockey said that the figures confirmed \u201cthe necessity for the delivery of our plan to significantly increase infrastructure spending over the next few years\u201d. Certainly much has been made in the past two years how Tony Abbott was determined to be the \u201cinfrastructure prime minister\u201d. In the past year fixed capital expenditure by the national government (essentially infrastructure such as road, bridges, ports and rail but excluding defence) rose a strong 16%.

State and local governments account for a majority of infrastructure spending either directly, or as in the case of the Building the Education Revolution stimulus, from money provided by the federal government, and such spending is declining. As a general rule, while private investment is growing, public investment should play a minimal role. During the GFC, when private investment fell to such an extent it was detracting 0.9% points from annual GDP growth, public investment spending filled the gap. But in the past year, not only has private infrastructure investment detracted from GDP growth, so too has public infrastructure spending. This puts the Victorian election result into the economic mix. Joe Hockey suggests failure to build the East West Link in Melbourne will continue to hurt the economy. But, given it was a very big commitment of the ALP to dump it, it seems unlikely that the project will go ahead. The Andrews government suggests it has other infrastructure plans, but the Abbott government is threatening to withhold the $3bn it had allocated for the East West Link. So the gloom could get worse due to politics? Oh. Goody. 5. NSW has the demand. WA has none. As noted last week when looking at the state accounts, Western Australia\u2019s economic growth is coming pretty much all from exports. It means that while its economy is growing, demand (a measure of consumption and investment) is falling. In WA, household consumption grew by just 0.5% in the September quarter, but private capital expenditure fell by 4.7%. It led to annual state final demand in WA falling for the sixth quarter in a row: By contrast, state final demand in New South Wales increased by 4% over the past year, driven by a 3.9% increase in household consumption and a 16% increase in dwelling construction. The biggest driver of household consumption in NSW was money spent on hotels, cafes and restaurants \u2013 contributing 0.9 percentage points to that 3.9% growth. Queensland, like WA, continued to see its final demand fall with the small rise in household consumption unable to cover the large falls in capital expenditure. What it means is that while the state accounts showed that, although WA continues to power the Australian economy by including exports, when we just look at state final demand, NSW is the powerhouse and WA is actually detracting from GDP growth: All of which highlights just how different the mining boom is now that it\u2019s all about exports and not investment \u2013 and alas with prices down the profits and thus tax revenue (for both the Australian and WA governments) isn\u2019t as much as hoped. So no, not much sunshine to be felt. 6. Labour is still productive, but the gains are slowing just a tad. As noted on Monday, unless labour productivity grows by 1.5% each year, the budget is going to take a pretty big hit over the next 10 years \u2013 and so will our standard of living. In the past year the standard measure of labour productivity, GDP per hour worked, grew by 2.2% in trend terms \u2013 an increase from 1.9% growth in the June quarter. This suggests all is well. And while that is good, my preferred measure of gross value added per hour worked market sector, which focuses more on productivity in the private sector grew by just 1.9% in the past year \u2013 a very slight fall from the 2.0% in the 12 months to June: But when we look at annual average growth over the past five years, there does seem to be a bit of a drop off. This time last year, the five-year annual average growth was 2.45%, now it is 2.2%. Nothing to get too panicky about, but one to watch. Similarly, labour costs suggest a slight levelling off in our competitiveness. Labour costs in the non-farm parts of the economy rose 0.4% in the past quarter accounting for inflation. But while the slight rise in real-unit labour costs in the past nine months would suggest a decrease in Australia competitiveness, this is mostly due to the very low inflation measure used to calculate the real GDP figures. According to the GDP figures, in the September quarter prices actually fell 0.4% in the September quarter and didn\u2019t grow at all over the past 12 months. And when you have 0% inflation that means any rise in wages will see an increase in \u201creal labour costs\u201d but that doesn\u2019t meant they are spiralling out of control. Indeed, as we know from the wages price index figures from two weeks ago that wage growth is the lowest its ever been. This is also reflected in the growth of nominal labour costs \u2013 which the RBA keeps an eye on to look at inflation concerns. They actually fell in the past year: So I guess if you\u2019re looking for a sunny note to end on let us just say the workers are still working pretty hard and well, but we\u2019re not getting any extra pay for doing so and our income feels like it has gone backwards. Yeah. Gloomy.",
