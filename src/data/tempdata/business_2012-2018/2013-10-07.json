Those August numbers showed a drop in sales on the month, confounding economists who had expected a rise to echo the recent run of upbeat indicators on the UK. Releasing its latest economic forecasts on Tuesday, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warns that it is \"too early to declare that the recovery is now secure\" and highlights risks remaining at home and abroad. Overall, however, the business group's quarterly survey of more than 7,000 businesses is relatively upbeat and the BCC is now forecasting GDP growth of around 0.9-1.0% in the third quarter, compared with 0.7% recorded for the second quarter. The survey shows improvements in most areas for both manufacturing and services compared with the second quarter. The group's director general, John Longworth, warned last month that the recovery presented risks for Britain, given politicians could now shift their attention away from driving economic growth. He welcomed the report, suggesting more firms are optimisic about growing sales and hiring more staff. \"We need to ensure that this does not become an aberration, but rather the norm, particularly when the economic recovery is still facing external risks,\" he said. \"Investment is still a concern, and if we are to have a high-productivity, high-skill, high-wage economy then this needs to improve,\" he added, calling for more support for exporters and better access to finance. HSBC has echoed those calls for more help for exporters with a list of policy recommendations for the government. The bank says its global connections report shows UK business confidence is returning, with strong hopes for the the hi-tech manufacturing sector in particular. But it argues export growth has been stifled in recent years. \"We know from talking to our customers that many businesses with massive export potential are still holding back from looking overseas,\" said Alan Keir, one of HSBC's most senior executives in the UK.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government will bow to a mounting outcry and ensure the public do not lose out to banks, hedge funds and other financial speculators in the \u00a33bn selloff of Royal Mail shares. The Guardian understands that ministers are making plans to increase amount of Royal Mail shares available to the public at the expense of those set aside for banks, following overwhelming demand in the biggest privatisation since the sale of the railways in the 1990s. Michael Fallon, the business minister in charge of the flotation, said he would do all he could to ensure \"smaller investors get their fair share\", ahead of Tuesday's midnight deadline to buy stock. Fallon had promised that about 30% of the shares on offer would be reserved for the public but is now understood to be planning to increase this proportion available for small investors and cut back on the amount going to banks if public demand massively exceeds supply. He said: \"No decisions have been taken on allocation but I'm committed to making sure smaller investors get their fair share.\" The government has been under pressure to ensure the public do not lose out to banks and hedge funds, which are hoping to make instant profits from the sale of the 500-year-old postal service. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said: \"This is turning into a dream and a bonanza for City speculators and hedge funds, meanwhile the taxpayer \u2026 is getting massively shortchanged.\" Financial institutions have ordered several times the number of shares available to them, amid reports that the government hugely undervalued the company, and the shares could soar by more than 30% on their first day's trading on Friday. Stockbrokers have also reported unprecedented public demand for the shares, to be priced at between \u00a33-3.30 each, with some staying open all weekend and until midnight Tuesday when applications close. Alastair McCaig, market strategist at IG Index, said public demand for Royal Mail's shares has been \"even stronger than we saw in Facebook\". IG said excitement over the flotation had sparked a frenzy in the pre-trading \"grey market\", with investors betting the shares will rise to \u00a34 on Friday \u2013 70p more than the maximum the government has allowed itself to sell them for. If they do reach \u00a34, the government will have lost out on an extra \u00a3400m it could have made if it priced the shares at \u00a34, rather than \u00a33.30. Panmure Gordon analyst Gert Zonneveld \u2013 the only analyst to have published research on the shares \u2013 has said he is convinced the government undervalued Royal Mail by more than \u00a31bn. Zonneveld said the shares should have been sold between \u00a33.70 and \u00a34.50, considerably higher than the government's initial range. Vince Cable, the business secretary, on Monday hit back at Umunna for accusing the government of undervaluing the company and selling it on the cheap. \"It is irresponsible to imply that a share offering looks significantly undervalued,\" he wrote in a letter.. \"I think you should consider the risk that you may be influencing the decisions of retail investors. Equity investment always involves risk, particularly when the company in question is new to the market. In the light of this it is dangerous to imply that there is an easy bargain to be made. \"Panmure Gordon is only one voice and their report notes both near term risks and opportunities. We are alert to value for money criticism and have learnt from the mistakes of previous governments' asset sales. QinetiQ is one key example under the last government.\" In 2007, the National Audit Office criticised the float of defence company QinetiQ saying taxpayers lost out to the tune of tens of millions of pounds. The government's valuation of Royal Mail is based on advice from investment banks Goldman Sachs and UBS after \u00a321.7m in fees was paid to advisers. Applications for shares close at 11.59pm on Tuesday. The minimum public application is \u00a3750. If the public apply for more shares than those available they will \"scaled back\", meaning applicants will not be able to buy all the shares they have applied for. Big applications will be scaled back at a greater rate than small applications. Up to 62% of the company will be listed on the stock market on Friday. A further 10% will be given to Royal Mail's 150,000 employees. The final price the shares sell at will not be decided until the company floats on the stock market on Friday. Trading places One of the accusations levelled at the Thatcher and Major governments was that they sold off Britain's nationalised industries too cheaply. A look at how the shares fared on their first day of trading lends weight to this argument, although long-term returns give a clearer picture of a company's value. British Telecom was the Thatcher government's first big privatisation. Its shares jumped 35% on the first day of trading in 1984, but when two later tranches were offered the price rose only 5% each time. British Gas followed in 1986, helped by its \"Tell Sid\" campaign. Its shares rose 10% on the first day. Powergen and National Power both soared by about 22% on their first trading days but when further batches of shares were sold later the price rose less than 5% in both cases. In 1987, British Airways' shares leapt by two thirds on their first day of trading. But later that year BP's privatisation was launched at the time of Black Monday when shares plunged in New York and London on 19 October. Underwriters were left holding shares priced at 330p that were trading at 262p. Most infamously, Railtrack shares rose 21% in value when they were sold in 1994. But fatal rail accidents and spiralling costs forced it into administration in 2001. Sean Farrell",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The idea that Royal Mail's shares could trade above 400p on day one should be treated with care. A grey market operated by a City spread-betting firm is not the real thing: volumes can be light and sentiment can shift suddenly. Come Friday, the first day of real trading, the mood could be different, especially if Washington is still a political shambles. Nevertheless there is a real risk that the public purse could be royally short-changed in the Royal Mail privatisation, even if the shares are priced at the top of the advertised range of 260p-330p. A 400p share price would represent a jump of 21% from 330p. The new owners of Royal Mail's equity would celebrate. Everybody else would be furious \u2013 and rightly so. This privatisation is not some gentle game where the old-school City mantra to \"leave something on the table\" must be obeyed. The government is likely to sell about 60% of its shares in one slug and hold back only a 30% stake (the other 10% goes to staff for free) so the price achieved in this sale will determine the bulk of the proceeds from flogging Royal Mail. The government's approach on behalf of taxpayers (and non-taxpayers, for that matter) should be straightforward: be ruthless about getting the highest price possible, as anybody selling their house or other substantial asset would be. It is true, of course, that few thought Royal Mail would achieve 330p a share or \u00a33.3bn, on the day the range was announced at the end of last month. But so what? The book-build process, being conducted by Goldman Sachs and UBS, is designed to minimise the guessing and establish real demand at specified levels. If the evidence shows the order book could be filled above 330p and there's an army of investors searching for high dividend-yielding stock, the logical response should be to lift the price range and try to bag the extra dosh. Expressed as pennies on a share price, it is easy to make the mistake of treating the sums as trifles. But the sale of a 60% stake involves the disposal by the government of 600m shares in Royal Mail. If those shares are sold 40p below the price that could have been achieved easily, the giveaway would amount to \u00a3240m. That's not a trifle. It's quite possible that no pricing controversy will arise. The shares might be sold at 330p and drift gently upwards to, say, 345p. A rise of 4.5% would be unremarkable. But 330p to, say, 380p would be a straightforward mispricing. It would be an outcome that Lazards, adviser to HM Government on the IPO, is presumably being employed to warn against.",

      "body": "<p>The idea that Royal Mail's shares could trade above 400p on day one should be treated with care. A grey market operated by a City spread-betting firm is not the real thing: volumes can be light and sentiment can shift suddenly. Come Friday, the first day of real trading, the mood could be different, especially if Washington is still a political shambles.</p> <p>Nevertheless there is a real risk that the public purse could be royally short-changed in the Royal Mail privatisation, even if the shares are priced at the top of the advertised range of 260p-330p. A 400p share price would represent a jump of 21% from 330p. The new owners of Royal Mail's equity would celebrate. Everybody else would be furious \u2013 and rightly so.</p> <p>This privatisation is not some gentle game where the old-school City mantra to \"leave something on the table\" must be obeyed. The government is likely to sell about 60% of its shares in one slug and hold back only a 30% stake (the other 10% goes to staff for free) so the price achieved in this sale will determine the bulk of the proceeds from flogging Royal Mail. The government's approach on behalf of taxpayers (and non-taxpayers, for that matter) should be straightforward: be ruthless about getting the highest price possible, as anybody selling their house or other substantial asset would be.</p> <p>It is true, of course, that few thought Royal Mail would achieve 330p a share or \u00a33.3bn, on the day the range was announced at the end of last month. But so what? The book-build process, being conducted by Goldman Sachs and UBS, is designed to minimise the guessing and establish real demand at specified levels. If the evidence shows the order book could be filled above 330p and there's an army of investors searching for high dividend-yielding stock, the logical response should be to lift the price range and try to bag the extra dosh.</p> <p>Expressed as pennies on a share price, it is easy to make the mistake of treating the sums as trifles. But the sale of a 60% stake involves the disposal by the government of 600m shares in Royal Mail. If those shares are sold 40p below the price that could have been achieved easily, the giveaway would amount to \u00a3240m. That's not a trifle.</p> <p>It's quite possible that no pricing controversy will arise. The shares might be sold at 330p and drift gently upwards to, say, 345p. A rise of 4.5% would be unremarkable. But 330p to, say, 380p would be a straightforward mispricing. It would be an outcome that Lazards, adviser to HM Government on the IPO, is presumably being employed to warn against.</p>",

Helena Morrissey, boss of Newton fund managers and a leading member of the 30% club, which promotes woman in boardrooms, points out that there are often only two executive positions on a board - the chief executive and the finance director - compared with six or so non-executive positions. There is also the problem with the \"pipeline\" of women coming up through the ranks of major companies. To tackle this, Sir Roger Carr, boardroom veteran who was recently named BAE chairman, intended to use a speech on Monday night to suggest companies set goals for female members of the executive committees that are one rung below the boardroom.

Sadly thanks to the Federal Reserve\u2019s endless QE, that restraint and imposed market discipline is no longer in place. And that is dangerous. Without the market check, Washington is risking ruin.</p> <p>So how are these \u201cbond vigilantes\u201d and how do they impose discipline on the ruling classes? They are simply the mass of investors in government debt who by their actions force governments back to the financial straight and narrow. If they think a Nation is spending too much without enough taxation, resulting in excessive deficits and ballooning debt, they will demand a higher interest rate. That is basic finance; higher risk is compensated by a higher return. So as a Nation\u2019s debt rises rapidly, the nation has to pay higher interest rates. So bond yields - borrowing costs - rise. And that is the restraint imposed upon governments - borrowing becomes more expensive the more fiscally irresponsible the government becomes.</p> <p>That is the check to stop politicians getting their country overly indebted.</p> <p>And it is the same mechanism with irresponsible monetary policy too - a higher yield is required by investors to compensate for the loss in monetary value from inflation. So bond investors are really important for financially feckless nations, because they that drag the ruling classes back to sensible economic policies (by demanding higher interest rates).</p> <p>But the problem is that the Federal Reserve is currently buying $85bn of bonds a month, manipulating America\u2019s borrowing costs lower.</p> <p>The Fed is the biggest player in the markets and if it wants bond yields down then few will bet they will go up. Thus there is no corrective mechanism. Without the Fed\u2019s QE, the current Washington fiasco would have increased America\u2019s borrowing costs and that would have helped to force politicians back to the negotiating table. It now looks likely that the Fed didn\u2019t taper in September as it was concerned about the impact the shutdown would have on the economy. It is also likely that with no non farm payrolls figure being released on Friday, the Fed will not taper in October either.</p> <p>Implicitly the Federal Reserve is bailing out the incompetency of Washington. The stick has been removed allowing the political class to play wild and threaten default.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c82b6617-abdd-40e5-96aa-314d5f6c2e78\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/7/1381143769479/219da052-d3b2-468e-aedb-b2b8ce660f97-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, speaking at a news conference, is seen on a television screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on September 18, 2013 in New York City..\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wall Street eyes were glued on&nbsp;Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke last month, as he explained why the Fed was not slowing its stimulus programme.

A good question (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/thestalwart\">from&#xa0;Joe Weisenthal</a>) was what the Republicans would have used to justify the&#xa0;stalemate if Obamacare wasn't there to argue over.</p> <p>And while I am sure the&#xa0;GOP could have found a reason for disruptive politics, it also seems clear&#xa0;that Obamacare is too important to the President's 'legacy' for him to&#xa0;compromise on that, while the right wing of the GOP is opposed on principle&#xa0;as much as anything else. But it's also clear that the Republicans are<br>'losing' the public relations war. I don't think that merely reflects my&#xa0;Twitter stream or choice of on-line reading.</p> <p>The big winner of this mess&#xa0;will be Hilary Clinton. And that, in turn, means that a compromise, with tax&#xa0;cuts elsewhere, is likely to be found to get a deal through that allows the&#xa0;debt ceiling to be increased by 17 October.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Jane Foley of Rabobank</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rallying call of Republican House Speaker Boehner over the weekend that it is \u201ctime for us to stand up and fight\u201d looks set to commit the shutdown of the US government into a second week.&#xa0;</p> <p>The vote by Congress in favour of paying the government workers who has been sent home on leave will offset some concerns about the economic costs of the shutdown. Even so, with the October 17 deadline for a debt default looming, investors are likely to become increasingly nervous with every passing day.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Shutdown Day 7 is unfortunately the theme for the day, and quite possibly for the week...</p> <p>While mutterings ahead of the weekend suggested that Boehner said he would make sure that there was no default, and some hopeful whispers of a few Tea Party aligned members of the House softening their stance, positioning as the week starts appears to be even more entrenched.</p> <p>The backlog of official US economic data is building quite rapidly with little obvious prospect of anything being published this week. One assumes that the end of week G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank heads may have little else to discuss, though the protests about the US political impasse (assuming it has not been resolved) from other G7 and EM countries will be vociferous.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Elsa Lignos of RBC Europe:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The hard line on both sides has unsurprisingly been taken negatively by risky assets.&#xa0;The Yen and Swiss franc are outperforming, US equity futures are pushing down towards Thursday\u2019s lows, while US Treasuries are still trading sideways.</p> <p>It is still a case of waiting and watching on developments in Washington. Our US Strategists expect that the longer the government remains dark, the greater the likelihood that the shutdown and debt ceiling issues are resolved together, which would result in a better outcome</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Investec Corporate Treasury</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some analysts have estimated that default is likely by November 1st when the Treasury Department is scheduled to make nearly $60 billion in payments to Social Security recipients, Medicare providers, civil service retirees, and active duty military service members.</p> <p>With such a limited window of time available all eyes will be on the US this week to see if a resolution can be reached.

We estimate that the fiscal&#xa0;pullback would amount to as much as 4.2% of GDP (annualized). The&#xa0;effect on quarterly growth rates (rather than levels) could be even&#xa0;greater.

This uncertainty alone could weigh on growth.</p> <p>But a long delay\u2014for example, several weeks\u2014would likely result in a government&#xa0;shutdown much broader than the one that started October 1. In the current shutdown,&#xa0;there is ample cash available to pay for government activities, but the administration has&#xa0;lost its authority to conduct \"non-essential\" discretionary programs which make up about&#xa0;15% of the federal budget.</p> <p>By contrast, if the debt limit were not increased, after late&#xa0;October the administration would still have authority to make most of its scheduled&#xa0;payments, but would not have enough cash available to do so.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52527967e4b041f09f138ad5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T09:24:41.487Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US deadlock hits euro investors</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1b0128f8-a791-467e-8c2f-2c8feb559585\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/7/1381137864207/c92997d0-b72a-45e4-b1a7-acc6724d5a32-460x264.png\" alt=\"Eurozone investor confidence\" width=\"460\" height=\"264\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Sentix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The US government shutdown debacle has hit&#xa0;</strong><strong>investor confidence within the eurozone</strong>,&#xa0;according to the latest data from German research firm <strong>Sentix.</strong></p> <p>Sentix's monthly measure of investor sentiment dropped to 6.1, from 6.5 in September.

A quick reminder of the key points: \u2022 China has publicly urged America to get to grips with its political crisis over the debt ceiling, as the US government shutdown entered its seventh day. Vice finance minister Zhu Guangyao told reporters in Beijing that America needs to take decisive steps swiftly, to prevent hitting its debt limit and defaulting. South Africa's finance minister made a similar appeal in London this afternoon, showing that international concern over the standoff is growing. \u2022 The lack of progress in Washington hit stock markets again. Most European indices closed in the red, and the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen around 0.5% this morning. Some US government debt rose in value though. \u2022 Here's a round-up of analyst comments about the situation, which appeared to escalate yesterday after Treasury secretary Jack Lew warned Congress was playing with fire. \u2022 And here's Goldman Sachs predicting severe spending cuts, and a 4.2% hit to GDP. if the debt ceiling is breached. \u2022 In Europe, Greece's government predicted it would return to growth in 2014. It published its draft budget today, as investors digested the news that hedge fund star John Paulson is investing heavily in Greek banks. \u2022 A former Greek defence minister was convicted in a major money-laundering trial. Akis Tzohatzopoulos will be sentenced on Tuesday. \u2022 And the World Bank cut its growth forecasts for several East Asia countries, including China. I'll be back tomorrow. Goodnight! GW Europe's stock markets clawed back some of today's losses, but most have just closed in the red. FTSE 100: down 16 points at 6437, - 0.16% German DAX: down 31 points at 8591, -0.36% French CAC: flat Spanish IBEX: down 39 points at 9381, -0.4% Italian FTSE MIB, up 121 points at 18425, +0.66% (shares in Italy rose again due to ongoing relief that the government survived last week's confidence vote) The Dow Jones index is still down in New York, but it's still not anything approaching a rout. The lack of market panic means less pressure on politicians in Washington DC to agree a deal urgently, warns Michael Hewson of CMC Markets. He writes: The bulls continue to melt away with the FTSE hitting one week lows, as the political rhetoric coming out of Washington continues to get more belligerent, and not less. It almost feels like the Republicans are spoiling for a fight, as politicians play Russian roulette with the markets, and this appears to be finally filtering through into overall investor sentiment. If anything the positioning of the two parties appears to be becoming more polarised and not less and as a result it seems unlikely that we will see a swift conclusion to the current impasse, which is sure to stoke even more uncertainty, as we close in on the October 17th deadline. Having been critical for so long of European politician\u2019s response to the crisis in Europe over the years, it is now the turn of the US to be at the beck and call of dysfunctional politics and politicians. I wonder if any of these Democrat and Republican politicians currently bickering amongst themselves, with the fate of the world economy in their hands, can see the irony in how the worm has turned, and how their behaviour damages the credibility of the US in the eyes of the rest of the world. South Africa's finance minister has echoed the concerns of China's Zhu Guangyao, by urging America avoid a technical default. In London for a conference today, Pravin Gordhan told Reuters there was a \"heightened sense of anxiety\" among the world's investors and policymakers Here's the key quotes from Gordhan: This is clearly an issue that might go to the brink. All of us need nerves of steel at this point. We need to anticipate the worst and hope that we all have sufficient defences in place. An actual US default, though, could trigger a crisis that would sweep away the strongest defences. Bloomberg has explained how it would dwarf the Lehman crisis five years ago: A U.S. Default Seen as Catastrophe Dwarfing Lehman\u2019s Fall On Wall Street, shares have clawed their way back a bit, but the Dow Jones is still in the red - down 78 points or 0.5% at 14,993. There's only five risers on the Dow, while credit cards firms Visa and American Express lead the fallers (see above). So far, the US stock market has help up pretty well in the face of the deadlock in Washington (historically, a US government shutdown is good for shares). The Dow Jones has been volatile at times, but has only lost around 275 points since last Monday -- less than 2%. The oil price is down today, with a barrel of Brent crude dropping by over one dollar to $108.44. That doesn't look to be related to the US standoff, though. Instead, it reflects relief that Tropical Storm Karen weakened over the weekend. That means oil work in the Gulf of Mexico is resuming, having been suspended a few days ago as Karen approached. China's warning to America to raise its debt ceiling swiftly comes as the issue becomes intertwined with Congress's failure a week ago to agree a budget for the new fiscal year (triggering the partial government shutdown). Terry Morris, senior vice president of National Penn Investors Trust Company in Pennsylvania, says the deadlock is a growing worry, telling Reuters: Now you\u2019ve got not only the budget but the debt ceiling and time is running out and everybody knows it.. The longer this goes on, the more the uncertainty, the closer the deadline and the more nervous investors are going to be. Gold has risen to a one-week high, with the spot price gaining 1.3% to $1,327 a ounce. Although shares are down on Wall Street, there's no sign of panic in the US stock markets over the budget and debt ceiling deadlock. Todd Horwitz of Average Joe Options is telling Bloomberg TV that traders don't like the uncertainty caused by the 'blowhards in Washington', saying: It's not a panic selloff, it's very controlled. Horwitz added that trading volumes are light at the moment, but could pick up as the debt ceiling deadline approached The closer we get to the 17th [October], the more action we'll see. Shares are falling in New York as the echoes from the Wall Street opening bell fade away. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 140 points in the first few minutes to 14931, a drop of almost 1%. The other indices are also down, matching losses in Europe. \u2022 FTSE 100: down 51 points at 6403, - 0.8% \u2022 German DAX: down 73 points at 8549 ,- 0.85% \u2022 French CAC: down 28 points at 4136, -0.67% Reaction to follow Business is underway in Washington DC, with White Officials sticking to their position that President Barack Obama will not negotiate with congressional Republicans under the threat of a debt default. Via Reuters: \"There has never been a period where you have a serious faction or a serious strategy by one political party ... to use the threat of default as the main tactic in extracting policy,\" White House National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling said at a Politico breakfast on Monday. On asset class isn't suffering from the looming debt ceiling today -- US sovereign debt. The price of 10-year Treasury bonds has actually risen this morning, showing stronger demand for America's debt. One-month bills are slightly weaker today, but are still changing hands at a yield (or rate of return) or just 0.147%. That doesn't suggest bond traders are frantically dashing to sell them. US debt is still being treated as a a place of safety, even though it's at the centre of this particular storm. Nick Dale-Lace, senior sales trader at CMC Markets, comments: Ironically it seems one beneficiary of a risk off morning is US treasuries, with investors continuing to flock to the very bonds that are apparently at risk of default. The ramifications of a default on bond markets are not clear cut, with much confusion about what the fallout would be given the dependency of the financial world on US debt markets. What are the legal triggers of such a default and are they irreversible? With every minute passed we edge closer to the unknown, and that is rarely good for the markets US politicians get their chance to heed China's chiding over the debt ceiling, when Congress returns to work today. Both the House and the Senate will be in session, with votes scheduled for the afternoon. However, none of the legislation on the table amounts to the 'clean' budget bill (stripped of cuts to the Affordable Care act) which the Democrats are demanding. CBS's News Mark Knoller is tweeting the state of play: China has raised the pressure on the US today, warning that time is running out to raise its debt ceiling. Vice finance minister Zhu Guangyao told reporters in Beijing that America needs to take decisive steps to prevent hitting its debt limit in a fortnight's time. The intervention came as European stock markets remained lower, on the seventh day of the US shutdown. In the Chinese government's first public comments on the deadlock, Zhu also urged Washington politicians to \"learn lessons from history\". A reminder that the US AAA credit rating was downgraded by S&amp;P two years ago after the last debt ceiling standoff. Zhu said (quotes via Reuters): The United States is totally clear about China's concerns about the fiscal cliff. We ask that the United States earnestly takes steps to resolve in a timely way before October 17 the political [issues] around the debt ceiling and prevent a U.S. debt default to ensure safety of Chinese investments in the United States and the global economic recovery This is the United States' responsibility. As the biggest single holder of US debt, China would be in the front line to suffer if Treasury prices fell - and would obviously be hit if the US were to stumble into a technical default. Beijing must have watched the deadlock in Washington with growing alarm (yesterday, Republicans continued to demand healthcare cuts as the Treasury Secretary warning Congress was playing with fire). Analysts were already concerned about the lack of progress (round-up here). with Goldman Sachs warning of drastic cutbacks if America breaches the debt ceiling (details here). Zhu's warning added to the jitteriness in the City. Shares remain down across Europe's trading floors, with the FTSE 100 down 50 points at 6402, a fall of 0.8%. The German and French stock markets are both down around 1%. Here's a round-up: Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, says there is an increasing 'fear factor' in the City as America moves closer to its debt ceiling: The news that US politicians have again put self-interest ahead of the greater good of the country by failing to make any progress in sorting out the budget or tackling the debt ceiling will have surprised few. As yet the US debt markets have remained calm but the closer we get to the mid-October deadline the less likely that is to remain the case. And as mentioned earlier, the US dollar is still down against most major currencies. The pound has gained almost 0.5% to $1.608 so far today. Here's a round-up of what City experts are saying about the deadlock in America over its budget talks, and the debt ceiling -- which the US will hit on 17 October. Louise Cooper of Cooper City: As the disaster that is Washington continues, the world needs bond vigilantes to bring the political class to its senses. Sadly thanks to the Federal Reserve\u2019s endless QE, that restraint and imposed market discipline is no longer in place. And that is dangerous. Without the market check, Washington is risking ruin. So how are these \u201cbond vigilantes\u201d and how do they impose discipline on the ruling classes? They are simply the mass of investors in government debt who by their actions force governments back to the financial straight and narrow. If they think a Nation is spending too much without enough taxation, resulting in excessive deficits and ballooning debt, they will demand a higher interest rate. That is basic finance; higher risk is compensated by a higher return. So as a Nation\u2019s debt rises rapidly, the nation has to pay higher interest rates. So bond yields - borrowing costs - rise. And that is the restraint imposed upon governments - borrowing becomes more expensive the more fiscally irresponsible the government becomes. That is the check to stop politicians getting their country overly indebted. And it is the same mechanism with irresponsible monetary policy too - a higher yield is required by investors to compensate for the loss in monetary value from inflation. So bond investors are really important for financially feckless nations, because they that drag the ruling classes back to sensible economic policies (by demanding higher interest rates). But the problem is that the Federal Reserve is currently buying $85bn of bonds a month, manipulating America\u2019s borrowing costs lower. The Fed is the biggest player in the markets and if it wants bond yields down then few will bet they will go up. Thus there is no corrective mechanism. Without the Fed\u2019s QE, the current Washington fiasco would have increased America\u2019s borrowing costs and that would have helped to force politicians back to the negotiating table. It now looks likely that the Fed didn\u2019t taper in September as it was concerned about the impact the shutdown would have on the economy. It is also likely that with no non farm payrolls figure being released on Friday, the Fed will not taper in October either. Implicitly the Federal Reserve is bailing out the incompetency of Washington. The stick has been removed allowing the political class to play wild and threaten default. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale I have no vote and hope I am non-partisan in this debate but I think that this is a row about principles as much as about power, which argues for a drawn-out impasse, though the odds still favour last-minute resolution. A good question (from Joe Weisenthal) was what the Republicans would have used to justify the stalemate if Obamacare wasn't there to argue over. And while I am sure the GOP could have found a reason for disruptive politics, it also seems clear that Obamacare is too important to the President's 'legacy' for him to compromise on that, while the right wing of the GOP is opposed on principle as much as anything else. But it's also clear that the Republicans are 'losing' the public relations war. I don't think that merely reflects my Twitter stream or choice of on-line reading. The big winner of this mess will be Hilary Clinton. And that, in turn, means that a compromise, with tax cuts elsewhere, is likely to be found to get a deal through that allows the debt ceiling to be increased by 17 October. Jane Foley of Rabobank The rallying call of Republican House Speaker Boehner over the weekend that it is \u201ctime for us to stand up and fight\u201d looks set to commit the shutdown of the US government into a second week. The vote by Congress in favour of paying the government workers who has been sent home on leave will offset some concerns about the economic costs of the shutdown. Even so, with the October 17 deadline for a debt default looming, investors are likely to become increasingly nervous with every passing day. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities: Shutdown Day 7 is unfortunately the theme for the day, and quite possibly for the week... While mutterings ahead of the weekend suggested that Boehner said he would make sure that there was no default, and some hopeful whispers of a few Tea Party aligned members of the House softening their stance, positioning as the week starts appears to be even more entrenched. The backlog of official US economic data is building quite rapidly with little obvious prospect of anything being published this week. One assumes that the end of week G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank heads may have little else to discuss, though the protests about the US political impasse (assuming it has not been resolved) from other G7 and EM countries will be vociferous. Elsa Lignos of RBC Europe: The hard line on both sides has unsurprisingly been taken negatively by risky assets. The Yen and Swiss franc are outperforming, US equity futures are pushing down towards Thursday\u2019s lows, while US Treasuries are still trading sideways. It is still a case of waiting and watching on developments in Washington. Our US Strategists expect that the longer the government remains dark, the greater the likelihood that the shutdown and debt ceiling issues are resolved together, which would result in a better outcome Investec Corporate Treasury Some analysts have estimated that default is likely by November 1st when the Treasury Department is scheduled to make nearly $60 billion in payments to Social Security recipients, Medicare providers, civil service retirees, and active duty military service members. With such a limited window of time available all eyes will be on the US this week to see if a resolution can be reached. In the meantime expect the US shutdown to dominate currency markets and be prepared for some volatility if a default starts to look more likely. Back to Greece, where the government has predicted a return to growth next year after a six-year slump. The draft 2014 budget, announced this morning by deputy finance minister Christos Staikouras, also forecasts a surplus excluding debt financing costs. This is a crucial target for Athens as it aims to agree further assistance from its international partners. Reuters has the details: Greece will emerge from six years of recession next year, its draft 2014 budget projected on Monday, in one of the strongest signs yet that the country has left the worst of its crippling debt crisis behind. The economy, which has shrunk about a quarter since its peak in 2007, will grow by 0.6% next year thanks to a rebound in investment and exports including tourism, the budget predicted. The economy is set to contract by 4 percent this year. Athens is also targeting a primary budget surplus of 1.6% of national output next year and is on track to post a small surplus this year. Attaining a primary surplus - excluding debt servicing costs - is key to helping Athens secure debt relief from its international lenders. \"In the last three years Greece found itself in a painful recession with an unprecedented level of unemployment,\" Deputy Finance Minister Christos Staikouras said as he unveiled the 2014 budget. \"Since this year the sacrifices have begun to yield fruit, giving the first signs of an exit from the crisis.\" These signs of recovery are encouraging hedge funds to buy stakes in Greek banks (see 9.12am) and fuelling rumours that Greece could swap some debt for new 50-year bond (see opening post). The budget also shows that Greece will run a deficit of 2.4% (including debt costs). This will push its public debt to 174.5% of GDP, despite investors taking a haircut early last year. How much damage would be caused if American politicians doesn't raise the debt ceiling before the October 17 deadline? Goldman Sachs has crunched the numbers, and told clients over the weekend that the Treasury would be forced into a drastic cutback in spending from the end of October which would wipe 4.2% off annualised GDP. The research note (from Saturday, but still well worth flagging) showed how the Treasury is on track to hit its borrowing limit in two weeks. After that point, the amount of money coming into the Treasury will equal only about 65% of spending going out, Goldman said. There are various ways that the US could play for time -- such as prioritising some payments over others, or delaying payments altogether. But officials would soon be forced to implement measures that would hurt growth badly, in a bid to avoid missing a debt repayment and triggering a downgrade to Selective Default status. Here's a flavour of the note: If the debt limit is not raised before the Treasury depletes its cash balance, it could force the Treasury to rapidly eliminate the budget deficit to stay under the debt ceiling. We estimate that the fiscal pullback would amount to as much as 4.2% of GDP (annualized). The effect on quarterly growth rates (rather than levels) could be even greater. If this were allowed to occur, it could lead to a rapid downturn in economic activity if not reversed very quickly. And more detail.... A very short delay past the October deadline\u2014for instance, a few days\u2014could delay the payment of some obligations already incurred and would create instability in the financial markets. This uncertainty alone could weigh on growth. But a long delay\u2014for example, several weeks\u2014would likely result in a government shutdown much broader than the one that started October 1. In the current shutdown, there is ample cash available to pay for government activities, but the administration has lost its authority to conduct \"non-essential\" discretionary programs which make up about 15% of the federal budget. By contrast, if the debt limit were not increased, after late October the administration would still have authority to make most of its scheduled payments, but would not have enough cash available to do so. The US government shutdown debacle has hit investor confidence within the eurozone, according to the latest data from German research firm Sentix. Sentix's monthly measure of investor sentiment dropped to 6.1, from 6.5 in September. Analyst had expected the index to jump to 8.0, but it appears morale has suffered from the deadlock in Washington. Sentix reported that investors' current assessment of the United States, and the assessment of prospects in six-months time, has been noticeably damaged by the budget row and the debt ceiling fears. Its headline index for the US dropped to 16.8, from 24.8 last month. Overall indices for the emerging markets regions rose, while those surveyed remain optimism for Japan's prospects. Over in Italy, Silvio Berlusconi is preparing to request a community service sentence, following his tax fraud conviction in August. Berlusconi, whose efforts to bring down the Italian government (and reignite the eurozone crisis) failed last week, has now turned his attention to his legal troubles. From Rome, Lizzy Davies has the story: \"Silent and humble manual tasks\" are not something to which Silvio Berlusconi has ever felt naturally drawn. Before big business and politics he sold vacuum cleaners and sang on cruise ships. Now, however, thanks to the Italian legal system, a very different kind of activity awaits him. His lawyer has said he intends to ask to serve his sentence for tax fraud in a community service placement. Franco Coppi said that barring any last-minute changes, the former prime minister's legal team would submit the request to the Milan courts by the end of this week. It would be then up to the judges to decide how to proceed. More here: Silvio Berlusconi to request community service for tax fraud sentence Court drama in Athens this morning, where a former defence minister has been found guilty of money-laundering. Akis Tzohatzopoulos was one of 17 defendants convicted after a five-month trial. Associated Press reports that Tzohatzopoulos's wife, ex-wife and daughter were also found guilty. Tzohatzopoulos was charged with accepting bribes in exchange for agreeing military hardware contracts, in the 1990s and the early 2000s. The court heard that these kickbacks were laundered through a network of offshore companies and property purchases. Sentences will be handed down tomorrow. Greek journalist Nick Malkoutzis reckons this is the most serious conviction of a Greek politician in around 20 years. In March, Tzohatzopoulos was convicted of corruption charges, after lying on his income statements and hiding luxurious spending. He was jailed for eight years following that case. Some interesting stories about Greece this morning. First up: John Paulson, the hedge fund boss who made billions of dollars betting against America's mortgage market before the crisis began, is a big fan of Greek banks. Paulson is making a serious move into the Greek financial sector, as investors gamble that the worst of its woes are over. The FT has the details: Mr Paulson, best known for his successful wager against the US subprime mortgage market in 2007, praised Greece\u2019s \u201cvery favourable pro-business government\u201d. \u201cThe Greek economy is improving, which should benefit the banking sector,\u201d Mr Paulson told the Financial Times. He confirmed his fund, Paulson &amp; Co, had substantial stakes in Piraeus and Alpha, the two banks that have emerged in best shape from the crisis. \u201c[Both] are now very well capitalised and poised to recover [with] good management,\u201d he said in rare public comments. More here: Paulson leads charge into Greek banks The US dollar has also dropped this morning against most major currencies. This pushed the yen up around 0.5%, to \u00a5 96.9 to the dollar. That won't please Japanese exporters, who'd rather see the yen over the \u00a5100 mark. America's stock indices are also expected to drop around 0.8% when trading begins in about 6 hours, Marketwatch flags up. The head of ratings agency Moody's reckons America won't default, even if it ploughs into the debt ceiling this month. Raymond McDaniel told CNBC overnight: Hopefully it is unlikely that we go past October 17 and fail to raise the debt ceiling, but even if that does happen, then we think that the U.S. Treasury is still going to pay on those Treasury securities. Europe's stock markets have followed Asia by falling in early trading, as investors fret over the lack of progress over America's government shutdown. In London the FTSE 100 swiftly shed 46 points, or 0.7%, with 95 of the companies on the index . It's a similar tale across Europe's markets, with Germany's DAX down 0.85% and the French CAC shedding 0.75% Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets sums up the mood in the City: Sentiment is still dampened by USuncertainty as the partial shutdown moves into its second week and the more troubling debt ceiling of 17 October nears. How long will this drag on for? Only the politicians know. The congressional stalemate shows no signs of progress with House Speaker Boehner adamant that a clean spending bill will not be approved while Treasury Secretary Lew says congress is playing with fire putting the nation\u2019s sovereign reputation at risk, on top of President Obama\u2019s highlighting of the potential impact on Q4 GDP. It all adds up to another sea of red on the European markets: America's deadlock isn't the only issue worrying the City today. The World Bank has warned that East Asia's economic growth is slowing as it cut its GDP forecasts several nations, including China. In a new report, the Bank said weaker commodity prices means weaker growth in the region. It also urged Chinese policymakers to tackle the consequences of recent loose policy and tighten financial supervision. Here's a flavour: Developing East Asia is expanding at a slower pace as China shifts from an export-oriented economy and focuses on domestic demand,\" the World Bank said in its latest East Asia Pacific Economic Update report. \"Growth in larger middle-income countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand is also softening in light of lower investment, lower global commodity prices and lower-than-expected growth of exports,\" it added. It now expects the Chinese economy to expand by 7.5% this year, down from its April forecast of 8.3%. For 2014, the forecast is cut from 8% to 7.7%. Full story here: World Bank cuts China growth forecasts Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. It's the seventh day of the US government shutdown, and the lack of progress in Washington continues to cast a shadow over the financial world. Shares have slipped in Asia overnight; in Japan, the Nikkei shed another 1.2%. European markets are expected to fall again. America seems no closer to a solution to the deadlock, nearly a week after the Federal government began shutting services and sending workers home. It is, though, closer to its debt ceiling -- the US is still on track to hit its maximum borrowing limit of $16.7bn on 17 October. Yesterday, Treasury secretary Jack Lew warned that America would default if the ceiling isn't raised. Congress, he said, was \"playing with fire\". Lew said: I'm telling you that on the 17th, we run out of the ability to borrow, and Congress is playing with fire. But the Republican-controlled House of Representatives hasn't blinked -- continuing to demand concessions from President Obama. House speaker John Boehner was defiant last night, saying his side would \"stand and fight\" for concessions on issues like healthcare reforms. Boehner told ABC television: You\u2019ve never seen a more dedicated group of people who are thoroughly concerned about the future of our country. The nation\u2019s credit is at risk because of the administration\u2019s refusal to sit down and have a conversation. So the deadlock continues, with investors pondering whether this impasse really could turn into a catastrophic debt default. Stan Shamu of IG explains that traders are more nervous than late last week: While Friday\u2019s modest gains in US equities were driven by a glimmer of hope that leaders are getting closer, this seems to have waned over the weekend. House speaker John Boehner was quoted as saying he wouldn\u2019t pass a bill to increase the US debt ceiling without addressing longer-term spending and budget challenges. This has really rattled markets and is likely to result in further near-term weakness for global equities. Not much on the economic calendar today, although we do get the latest eurozone reading of investor confidence at 9.30am BST. In the UK, the row over the Royal Mail privatisation continues, with critics warning that it's being sold off too cheaply. While in Greece, there were reports on Saturday that Athens is considering swapping some bailout loans for new 50-year bonds, as part of a third aid package. Reuters had the story: Greece mulls swapping bailout loans with 50-year bond issue: source I'll be tracking all the action through the day....",

      "body": "<p>Winning the Champions League is the dream of the world's top football clubs.</p> <p>It is also the goal of top flight broadcasters, and a successful campaign is as crucial to TV companies like <strong>BSkyB</strong> as it would be to a Premier League manager, according to analysts at Nomura.</p> <p>BSkyB has faced an upstart arrival in BT Sport as far as coverage of UK football is concerned, but the European competition is set to be the next battleground. Nomura said:</p> <blockquote> With Sky stock close to a 10-year high, we see the rights to the Champions League as critical, more important than the actual price paid. If Sky retains the rights, even at a high cost, that will signal a robust defence of its business model and it could cut cost elsewhere (eg, movies). If BT captures the rights, investors will assume it intends to be even more aggressive on Premier League next time around, and that could signal a seminal change in market dynamics. </blockquote> <p>As far as the effect on BSkyB of BT's entry into sport so far, Nomura said:</p> <blockquote> We estimate the impact will turn out to be in line with our initial expectations. We continue to assume net adds of around 75,000 versus around 100,000 last year. For 2014 our 5.2m broadband forecast assumes a similar run-rate of 75,000 versus an average of around 125,000 last year. Promotional activity has been very high from most operators.

      "bodyText": "Winning the Champions League is the dream of the world's top football clubs. It is also the goal of top flight broadcasters, and a successful campaign is as crucial to TV companies like BSkyB as it would be to a Premier League manager, according to analysts at Nomura. BSkyB has faced an upstart arrival in BT Sport as far as coverage of UK football is concerned, but the European competition is set to be the next battleground. Nomura said: With Sky stock close to a 10-year high, we see the rights to the Champions League as critical, more important than the actual price paid. If Sky retains the rights, even at a high cost, that will signal a robust defence of its business model and it could cut cost elsewhere (eg, movies). If BT captures the rights, investors will assume it intends to be even more aggressive on Premier League next time around, and that could signal a seminal change in market dynamics. As far as the effect on BSkyB of BT's entry into sport so far, Nomura said: We estimate the impact will turn out to be in line with our initial expectations. We continue to assume net adds of around 75,000 versus around 100,000 last year. For 2014 our 5.2m broadband forecast assumes a similar run-rate of 75,000 versus an average of around 125,000 last year. Promotional activity has been very high from most operators. Core pricing has remained roughly intact. In fact, BT has raised line rental by 3.5%, calls by 6.4% and broadband access (for packages before August 2013) by 6.5%.

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Is Mark Carney's forward guidance plan a step backwards?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "If Mark Carney was going to live up to his billing as a \"rock star central banker\" \u2013 and his \u00a3874,000 a year pay package \u2013 he had to arrive in Threadneedle Street on a crashing crescendo. His first 100 days as Bank of England governor have been a noisy medley of speeches, impeccably tailored photo-calls and pzazz. From the need for more women on banknotes to his love of Everton football club, Carney has had plenty to say on a range of subjects since his appointment on 1 July this year. However, it's the Bank's new policy tool of forward guidance that has provoked the most interest, and a good measure of scepticism, among seasoned Bank-watchers. Honed by Carney in Canada and adopted by the US Federal Reserve and the ECB in different forms, forward guidance is a way of signalling to the public and financial markets how the Bank will respond to shifts in the economy. In this case, the monetary policy committee has pledged to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5% at least until the unemployment rate falls to 7%. \"Forward guidance is an attempt to persuade the markets that interest rates are not immediately going to go up,\" says John Van Reenen, director of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. \"It's one more tool in the toolbox.\" However, as implemented by Carney and his colleagues in the UK, guidance is hedged about with three separate \"knockouts\" \u2013 rates would rise if inflation, financial stability or the public's inflation expectations got out of control. Moreover, the governor has stressed that the 7% unemployment rate is not a trigger for a rate rise, but a \"staging post\", which will not necessarily prompt tighter policy. During a somewhat fraught hearing with MPs on the cross-party Treasury select committee last month, in which Carney sought to clarify the policy, chairman Andrew Tyrie expostulated that it would be a hard one to explain \"down the Dog and Duck\". Financial markets have also been less than convinced. The yield, or effective interest rate, on British government bonds \u2013 partly a measure of investors' expectations of future interest rates \u2013 has risen rather than fallen since the Bank's announcement. That is partly because the latest data suggests the economic outlook is improving, but rapidly rising bond yields can be worrying because they tend to push up borrowing costs right across the economy. Carney, though, has insisted he is not concerned. Meanwhile the pound has risen almost 4% against the dollar since Carney took the helm \u2013 again signalling markets expect rates to rise sooner than the Bank is indicating. Last week sterling hit a nine-month high, although it came off that peak as investors began to question if the UK's recovery could continue at its current pace. \"I don't think in practice forward guidance is very successful,\" says Jamie Dannhauser of Lombard Street Research. He believes Carney has failed to convince the City he means business, because he has failed to back up forward guidance with action, such as the promise of a fresh round of quantitative easing \u2013 the Bank scheme that has pumped \u00a3375bn of freshly minted money into the economy. \"[Forward guidance] doesn't work if you're not willing to take on the markets if you don't get your way,\" says Dannhauser. David Blanchflower, a former member of the MPC, is more blunt: \"He looks already, within a hundred days, to have lost control. Bond yields are rising, the pound is rising like mad, and they've got no response.\" He argues that the hedged nature of the new policy is likely to reflect \"horse-trading\" between Carney and his fellow MPC members. Unlike in Canada, where what the central bank governor says goes, decision-making on the MPC is by vote. With a recovery now under way, its various members are known to have differing views on what are the most pressing risks to the economy. Another former MPC member said: \"Had I been on the MPC I would have let him do it [forward guidance], because I don't think it does any particular harm; but I don't think it does much good either.\" It's not just the Bank's approach to monetary policy that has changed on Carney's watch. When outgoing deputy governor Paul Tucker, who missed out on the top job, leaves for the US later this month, it will mark the latest in a number of personnel changes that are starting to make Carney's Bank look quite different from Lord (Mervyn) King's. Blue-blooded banker Charlotte Hogg joined as the Bank's new chief operating officer, a post that didn't exist under the old regime, on the same day as Carney. Meanwhile Tucker will be replaced by former Treasury and Foreign Office apparatchik Sir Jon Cunliffe. With long-serving deputy governor Charlie Bean due to leave early in 2014, Carney will be given another opportunity to bring in a new broom. Insiders say the atmosphere in the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters has already changed. Carney is often seen eating lunch in the canteen or showing visitors around. His approach is less hierarchical than that of King, who was derided as the \"Sun King\", by former chancellor Alistair Darling \u2013 though Carney is said to be no keener on intellectual dissent than his predecessor. He will need all the allies he can get both inside and outside the Bank, if he is to deal successfully with what many analysts see as the greatest threat facing the economy: the risk that an unsustainable bubble is starting to inflate in Britain's boom-bust housing market. Carney and his colleagues on the Bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC), the group tasked with preventing future crashes which partly overlaps with the MPC, have new powers to rein in mortgage lending if they believe a bubble is emerging, and the governor has said he won't hesitate to use them. But the FPC is untested and largely unknown to the public, and bubbles are notoriously hard to spot. Using the FPC's influence to choke off the supply of high loan-to-value mortgages, for example, would be hugely controversial at a time when large numbers of would-be buyers have been frozen out of the market. Meanwhile, the government's extension of the Help to Buy scheme, with details to be laid out on Tuesday, is likely to increase the demand for property, potentially pushing up prices. Van Reenen warns that if property prices do take off, Carney could find himself in an unenviable position. \"We have this terrible problem in this country that house prices have got completely out of kilter with incomes. I would be very reluctant to see interest rates start pushing up. Using other methods, such as being tougher on Help to Buy, and trying to do things through prudential regulation is better \u2013 but the fundamental thing is lack of houses, and Carney can't do anything about that.\"",

      "body": "<p>If Mark Carney was going to live up to his billing as a \"rock star central banker\" \u2013 and his \u00a3874,000 a year pay package \u2013 he had to arrive in Threadneedle Street on a crashing crescendo. His first 100 days as Bank of England governor have been a noisy medley of speeches, impeccably tailored photo-calls and pzazz.</p> <p>From the need for more women on banknotes to his love of Everton football club, Carney has had plenty to say on a range of subjects since his appointment on 1 July this year. However, it's the Bank's new policy tool of forward guidance that has provoked the most interest, and a good measure of scepticism, among seasoned Bank-watchers.</p> <p>Honed by Carney in Canada and adopted by the US Federal Reserve and the ECB in different forms, forward guidance is a way of signalling to the public and financial markets how the Bank will respond to shifts in the economy. In this case, the monetary policy committee has pledged to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5% at least until the unemployment rate falls to 7%.</p> <p>\"Forward guidance is an attempt to persuade the markets that interest rates are not immediately going to go up,\" says John Van Reenen, director of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. \"It's one more tool in the toolbox.\"</p> <p>However, as implemented by Carney and his colleagues in the UK, guidance is hedged about with three separate \"knockouts\" \u2013 rates would rise if inflation, financial stability or the public's inflation expectations got out of control. Moreover, the governor has stressed that the 7% unemployment rate is not a trigger for a rate rise, but a \"staging post\", which will not necessarily prompt tighter policy.</p> <p>During a somewhat fraught hearing with MPs on the cross-party Treasury select committee last month, in which Carney sought to clarify the policy, chairman Andrew Tyrie expostulated that it would be a hard one to explain \"down the Dog and Duck\".</p> <p>Financial markets have also been less than convinced. The yield, or effective interest rate, on British government bonds \u2013 partly a measure of investors' expectations of future interest rates \u2013 has risen rather than fallen since the Bank's announcement. That is partly because the latest data suggests the economic outlook is improving, but rapidly rising bond yields can be worrying because they tend to push up borrowing costs right across the economy. Carney, though, has insisted he is not concerned.</p> <p>Meanwhile the pound has risen almost 4% against the dollar since Carney took the helm \u2013 again signalling markets expect rates to rise sooner than the Bank is indicating. Last week sterling hit a nine-month high, although it came off that peak as investors began to question if the UK's recovery could continue at its current pace.</p> <p>\"I don't think in practice forward guidance is very successful,\" says Jamie Dannhauser of Lombard Street Research. He believes Carney has failed to convince the City he means business, because he has failed to back up forward guidance with action, such as the promise of a fresh round of quantitative easing \u2013 the Bank scheme that has pumped \u00a3375bn of freshly minted money into the economy.</p> <p>\"[Forward guidance] doesn't work if you're not willing to take on the markets if you don't get your way,\" says Dannhauser.</p> <p>David Blanchflower, a former member of the MPC, is more blunt: \"He looks already, within a hundred days, to have lost control. Bond yields are rising, the pound is rising like mad, and they've got no response.\"</p> <p>He argues that the hedged nature of the new policy is likely to reflect \"horse-trading\" between Carney and his fellow MPC members. Unlike in Canada, where what the central bank governor says goes, decision-making on the MPC is by vote. With a recovery now under way, its various members are known to have differing views on what are the most pressing risks to the economy.</p> <p>Another former MPC member said: \"Had I been on the MPC I would have let him do it [forward guidance], because I don't think it does any particular harm; but I don't think it does much good either.\"</p> <p>It's not just the Bank's approach to monetary policy that has changed on Carney's watch. When outgoing deputy governor Paul Tucker, who missed out on the top job, leaves for the US later this month, it will mark the latest in a number of personnel changes that are starting to make Carney's Bank look quite different from Lord (Mervyn) King's.</p> <p>Blue-blooded banker Charlotte Hogg joined as the Bank's new chief operating officer, a post that didn't exist under the old regime, on the same day as Carney. Meanwhile Tucker will be replaced by former Treasury and Foreign Office apparatchik Sir Jon Cunliffe. With long-serving deputy governor Charlie Bean due to leave early in 2014, Carney will be given another opportunity to bring in a new broom.</p> <p>Insiders say the atmosphere in the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters has already changed.

It is a significant win for Airbus and the A350, which is designed to be more fuel efficient. The aircraft is a direct competitor of Boeing's Dreamliner, which has been bit by safety and technical issues this year. Yoshiharu Ueki, president of Japan Airlines (JAL), said the A350 fleet would allow the company to take advantage of \"new business opportunities after slots at airports in Tokyo are increased\". The new JAL Airbus fleet is scheduled to be operational from 2019, gradually replacing its ageing fleet over a six-year period. Of the 31 aircraft ordered, 18 will be A350-900s, which typically offer three classes of seating and carry more than 300 passengers. The remaining 13 will be A350-1000s, which seat 350 passengers on longer flights. Fabrice Bregier, the Airbus president and chief executive, said the order marked a \"new chapter\" for the aircraft maker in Japan. Airbus has now received orders for more than 750 A350s from 38 customers worldwide and it is hoped that the first of the new aircraft will be ready for commercial service in the second half of 2014. News of the order was also welcomed by the British company Rolls-Royce, which will supply its Trent engine for all 31 aircraft. In a separate announcement Rolls said it had won two contracts, with a combined value of up to $496m, to support T56 engines on US government aircraft. Under the six-year contract the FTSE 100 company will supply parts and field and engineering support for thousands of T56 engines, which have been in production since the 1950s. The contract, awarded by the Defence Logistics Agency, will support around 1,000 C-130, P-3 and C-2 aircraft in service with the US Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard and Customs and Border Control as well as international fleets.

Rating agency Moody's says US default is extremely unlikely with debt payments being made even after the deadline. With the Fed/markets using data to decide/price in policy changes and tapering, the waters may still remain muddied even after a budget/debt ceiling solution. Fed speakers still making noise (stimulus for longer, can't counter fiscal uncertainty).As we said on Friday, sovereign uncertainty no good, but no tapering until 2014 is risk positive. Royal Bank of Scotland is down 7.1p at 366.1p following reports the UK government had sought EU approval if it decides to split RBS into a good and bad bank. Lloyds Banking Group is also lower, down 1.42p at 73.49p. Among the risers Mexican miner Fresnillo has added 10p to 923.5p after UBS raised its recommendation from neutral to buy, saying recent share price weakness made the company attractive.",
