So far this year the firm, known for its cheaper casual footwear which has been dubbed \u201cathleisure\u201d, has sold $1.57bn worth of shoes and overtaken Adidas to become the nation\u2019s second-biggest sports shoe brand after Nike. Shares in the company, which jumped 9.72% to $141 in after-hours trading on Wednesday, have risen by 133% so far this year. \u201cSkechers is clearly in the midst of the most exciting time in the company\u2019s 23-year history,\u201d the chief executive, Robert Greenberg, said. \u201cThe present has never looked as colorful, comfortable and successful thanks to our product and marketing, and resulting record sales, shipments and earnings.\u201d The company, which recently signed All About That Bass singer Meghan Trainor as the face of Skechers, plans to open 125-135 new shops this year to add to its global footprint of 1,126 stores. While the brand is proving popular with teens, some previous Skechers customers are still smarting from it falsely claiming that its Shape Up shoes helped wearers lose weight and even combat heart disease.

      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday continued to pave the way for an increase in interest rates as early as September. The US central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at near zero \u2013 where it has been since the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 but once again signalled that rates will rise later this year. While the Fed chair, Janet Yellen, has left little doubt that rates will rise this year, the Fed left itself wiggle room as it has set no timetable and said rates would only be raised if the economy continues to improve and unemployment continues to fall. Many market watchers expect rates to be raised at the Fed\u2019s next policy meeting on 16-17 September, when Yellen will hold a press conference. The central bank has another meeting scheduled for December. Earlier this month, Yellen told Congress: \u201cOur economy is in a much better state. Low interest rates have facilitated it, and a decision on our part to raise rates will say, \u2018No, the economy doesn\u2019t stink.\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019re close to where we want to be, and we now think the economy can not only tolerate but needs higher rates. So there have been headwinds, and we\u2019ve tried to use monetary policy to overcome them.\u201d Tom di Galoma, head of rates trading at ED&amp;F Man Capital, said: \u201cThe economy is improving, but they are not really saying that the economy is taking off here. If the Fed doesn\u2019t raise rates in September, I think we\u2019re looking at some time mid-next year.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s statement pointed to improvements in the unemployment rate, consumer spending and housing. The language of the statement was little changed, but for the first time it pointed to \u201csolid\u201d job gains. The unemployment rate has fallen to a seven-year low of 5.3%. It continued to describe economic activity as expanding \u201cmoderately\u201d. The Fed said it still expects inflation to rise gradually toward its 2% target. It left unchanged its phrasing on raising rates \u201cwhen it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2% objective over the medium term\u201d. The committee has kept the benchmark overnight federal funds rate at a record low of 0-0.25% since December 2008 as the global economy struggled with the worst recession since the Great Depression. Yellen has repeatedly stressed that when the Fed does raise rates it will do so only gradually. She has suggested that raising rates in small increments, followed by pauses, will let the Fed assess the effects of slightly higher borrowing costs. US stocks spiked slightly after the Fed\u2019s statement.",

So there have been headwinds, and we\u2019ve tried to use monetary policy to overcome them.\u201d</p> <p> Tom di Galoma, head of rates trading at ED&amp;F Man Capital, said: \u201cThe economy is improving, but they are not really saying that the economy is taking off here. If the Fed doesn\u2019t raise rates in September, I think we\u2019re looking at some time mid-next year.\u201d</p> <p>Wednesday\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150729a.htm\">statement</a> pointed to improvements in the unemployment rate, consumer spending and housing. The language of the statement was little changed, but for the first time it pointed to \u201csolid\u201d job gains. The unemployment rate has fallen to a seven-year low of 5.3%. It continued to describe economic activity as expanding \u201cmoderately\u201d. </p> <p>The Fed said it still expects inflation to rise gradually toward its 2% target. It left unchanged its phrasing on raising rates \u201cwhen it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2% objective over the medium term\u201d.</p> <p>The committee has kept the benchmark overnight federal funds rate at a record low of 0-0.25% since December 2008 as the global economy struggled with the worst recession since the Great Depression.</p> <p>Yellen has repeatedly stressed that when the Fed does raise rates it will do so only gradually. She has suggested that raising rates in small increments, followed by pauses, will let the Fed assess the effects of slightly higher borrowing costs.</p> <p>US stocks spiked slightly after the Fed\u2019s statement.</p>",

      "bodyText": "And that, I think, is all for another day. G\u2019night all! GW You can read the Fed\u2019s statement here, by the way. A September interest rate hike is still on the cards, says Steve Murphy of Capital Economics. Here\u2019s his take on the Federal Reserve\u2019s statement: In its latest FOMC policy statement, the Fed did not provide any clear hints that a September rate hike is coming. Nevertheless, this doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t happen, especially since the statement sounded a bit more upbeat on the economy. The policy statement was largely unchanged, with only some minor tweaks to acknowledge the improvement in the economic data. The housing sector is described as showing \u201cadditional\u201d rather than \u201csome\u201d improvement, jobs gains are now thought to be \u201csolid\u201d and the unemployment rate is \u201cdeclining\u201d rather than \u201cremained steady\u201d as before. These tweaks fall well short of a clear hint that a rate hike is coming at the next meeting in September. Note the Fed flagged up a hike at the meeting before the first rise in the tightening cycle in 2004. Nonetheless, Yellen has recently stressed that each meeting is \u201clive\u201d and \u201cdata dependent\u201d so this was always unlikely. The more positive tone of the statement is a sign that the first rate hike is coming closer. Given that in June 15 of 17 officials expected rates to rise this year and 10 of 17 anticipated two 25 basis-point increases, there\u2019s a good change that rates will rise at two of the three meetings left this year. September is very much in play, especially if international risks continue to recede and core inflation continues to strengthen. Our view is that the Fed will raise rates at the September meeting and to 0.50-0.75% at year-end. Perhaps more importantly, stronger wage growth and core inflation will prompt rates to rise by more than currently anticipated by the markets, taking them to 2.25-2.50% by end-2016. Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, says the Fed will want to ensure that the two employment reports between the July and September meetings aren\u2019t \u201cduds\u201d before signalling that they\u2019re ready to raise borrowing costs. Janet Yellen and colleagues will also be watching for any global risks flaring up, which could knock a rate rise off course. That\u2019s via Marketwatch: Analysts at BNP Paribas, the French bank, say the Fed has left its options open with today\u2019s little-changed statement on monetary policy: Here\u2019s a flavour of BNP\u2019s new note to clients: Before lift-off the Fed also wants to be reasonably confident in its forecast for inflation to return to target over the medium-term; crude oil prices falling 17% and the dollar appreciating further probably did not increase their confidence, but there was no explicit sign in the statement that the Fed is losing confidence on its inflation outlook \u2013 we will get more intel on this when the June meeting minutes are released. We think the Fed will continue to assess rate hikes on a meeting-by-meeting basis. In Yellen\u2019s testimony before Congress two weeks ago, we heard that the Fed wants to see a bit more labor market improvement before lift-off \u2013 this is exactly what the statement said. With two payrolls reports before the September FOMC, the Fed does not know when it will have that improvement in the bag and wants to keep its options open. The majority of market forecasters think we could be there before September. We think December. The Fed is confident we\u2019ll get there before year-end. Here\u2019s all you really need to know about the Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement: The US stock market had a brief fluctuation at Fed o\u2019clock, but it didn\u2019t last long. The immediate reaction is that today\u2019s Fed statement makes a September rate hike a little less likely. But there\u2019s not much in it, given there\u2019s no radical change between the new statement and the last one. Basically, Janet Yellen and colleagues aren\u2019t quite ready to pull the lever to raise borrowing costs - and want to see more data from the US jobs market over the summer. The markets aren\u2019t quite sure what to make of the Fed statement. The dollar plunged when the first newsflashes came up, but has now bounced back. There are two significant changes in today\u2019s statement from the Federal Reserve. 1) It has added a reference to the labor market \u2018continuing to improve\u2019, and slightly hardened its language about the underutilisation of resources diminishing (ie, fewer people working less than they want) 2) It has removed a reference to energy prices stabilising: CNBC has helpfully highlighted the statement: Today\u2019s decision was unanimous, the Fed adds. Here we go! The Federal Reserve has resisted raising interest rates from their current record low, of 0% to 0.25%. The US central bank says that it will raise interest rates when it has seen \u201csome further improvement\u201d in the labour market (or the labor market, I guess). Is that a hint of a rise in September? The Fed also repeats that the risks to the economy and the jobs market are \u201cnearly balanced\u201d, showing that it hasn\u2019t - yet - been pushed into a rate hike. OK, nearly time for the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision.... Time for a recap: The issue of Greece\u2019s unsustainable debt burden has moved back up the agenda, as top officials from the country\u2019s creditors prepare to begin talks on a third bailout. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has reiterated the Fund\u2019s position, that \u201csignificant\u201d debt relief is needed, as part of a new aid deal. Lagarde also wants to see \u201csensible fiscal targets\u201d (which must take account of the recent economic turmoil), \u201cstructural measures\u201d to reform the Greek economy, and enough funding to cover Athens\u2019 medium-term financing needs. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has also put debt relief front-and-centre, telling a radio interview that Greece should get help in November. Tsipras also warned that Greece\u2019s eurozone membership is still up in the air until the third bailout is agreed. And he threw down the gauntlet to rebels in his party, saying they must either support the government or resign. Ratcheting up the pressure, Tsipras also suggested that he could be forced to call early elections if he doesn\u2019t have Syriza\u2019s support. Tsipras warned: \u201cI\u2019m the last person who would want elections....If I don\u2019t have a parliamentary majority, though, we will be forced to head to a snap vote.\u201d Speculation is growing that former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis could ultimately face charges over his plan to develop a parallel payment system. The country\u2019s top prosecutor has asked parliament to examine complaints over the issue. Greece is preparing for tough negotiations with its creditors over a third bailout - with IMF negotiator Delia Velculescu arriving tomorrow. While European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici insists that Grexit is off the table, the prime minister of Bavaria is less sure - he fears \u2018utter chaos\u2019 if Greece fails to reform and leaves the eurozone. And the financial markets remain calm, as investors await the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on interest rates at 7pm BST (or 2pm East Coast time) Asked about the prospect of a US rate rise, Christine Lagarde predicts \u201ca variation of monetary policy in the not-too-distant future\u201d. And she ends her first online press conference by telling reporters that she hopes they\u2019re comfy, with their feet on the desk and a cup of coffee (or watching the Ashes, perhaps....) Four legs good..... Christine Lagarde has warned that Greece needs \u201csignificant\u201d debt relief - laying down the conditions for the IMF to take part in the third bailout. She told today\u2019s virtual press conference that any rescue plan for Greece will be unworkable without some form of debt relief. \u201cFor any programme to fly, a significant debt restructuring should take place.\u201d Lagarde added that a rescue plan would have to involve \u201cfour legs\u201d: sensible fiscal targets, that are delivered structural measures to open up the Greek economy sufficient financing to make the programme workable debt restructuring Lagarde added that the IMF would be looking at what the Greek government does, not what it says, promising to disregard what she called political \u201cnoise\u201d, and focus on \u201cdeeds, not creeds\u201d. IMF chief Christine Lagarde is holding her first ever virtual press conference with reporters. Top spokesman Gerry Rice is putting the questions (don\u2019t go easy on the boss, Gerry!) The event started with Lagarde joking that she was trying to imagine us all behind the little computer screen *waves*. And then to business, with a warning that the global recovery is \u201ca little bit too tepid\u201d and fragile for her liking. On the eurozone, Lagarde says it appears to be \u2018turning the corner\u2019. And on China, she\u2019s believes that the current stock market volatility isn\u2019t a reason to panic. The ECB has maintained its current support for the Greek banking sector today, at almost \u20ac91bn. Why no increase? Apparently the Bank of Greece didn\u2019t ask for one - suggesting that the outflow of deposits has stabilised (and with capital controls in force, that\u2019s understandable). In a drama fast unraveling in Athens the scene has been set for possible criminal charges to be brought against former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis following revelations of his secret plan to establish an alternative currency in the event of Greece\u2019s euro ejection. Helena Smith reports: Amid cries of high treason, the country\u2019s most senior state prosecutor, Efterpi Koutzamani, ordered the Greek parliament to examine an array of complaints brought by private citizens against Varoufakis. The Supreme Court prosecutor, who played a leading role in putting the far right Golden Dawn on trial, also asked a magistrate to investigate whether criminal charges should be brought against non-political figures, following Varoufakis\u2019s admission of a plan to hack Greece\u2019s tax service to set up the parallel payment system. \u201cI would not want to be in Varoufakis\u2019 shoes,\u201d the conservative MP and shadow finance minister Anna Asimakopoulou told the Guardian. \u201cI think that it is highly likely he will end up in a courtroom.\u201d As a sitting MP, the maverick economist enjoys immunity from prosecution. But the prosecutor\u2019s move now opens the way to criminal charges being bought against him if parliament determines there are grounds to establish a special congressional committee to probe the allegations. Judicial sources said the charges could range from dereliction of duty to overseeing the formation of a criminal gang \u2013 the central accusation brought against Golden Dawn whose leaders are currently on trial. The five-member team tasked with organizing the alternative currency \u2013 described by the former finance minister as a form of parallel liquidity - could also face accusations of participating in a criminal organization. The working group was headed by the well-known US economist, James K Galbraith, who was seconded to help Varoufakis until the politician\u2019s resignation earlier this month. In five separate suits brought against him, the academic-turned-MP has also been accused him of high treason although legal experts said the charge would be very hard to prove. His perceived mishandling of highly fraught negotiations with the EU and International Monetary Fund \u2013 the bodies keeping debt-stricken Greece afloat \u2013 has been blamed for the tough measures imposed on Athens in exchange for a third bailout of emergency loans from international creditors. By failing to agree on a cash-for-reform programme earlier, the crisis-plagued country was forced to sign up to a deal outlining \u20ac12bn of savings rather than \u20ac8bn as originally thought. The closure of banks and imposition of capital controls \u2013 implemented under Varoufakis\u2019 stewardship \u2013 are said to have wrought at least \u20ac3bn worth of damage on the economy with prolonged recession now predicted for a country that has experienced record levels of unemployment and poverty since the eruption of the debt crisis five years ago. In recent days even senior members of prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 radical left Syriza party have joined in the criticism, attributing the tough stance of lenders to the outspoken politician\u2019s handling of the talks. Syriza MP and vice president of the 300-seat House Alexis Mitropoulos told Mega TV that: \u201cWith his loquaciousness, with his naivety, with his zeal to prove his ideas more than anything else, it seems that he hurt the Greek issue.\u201d Varoufakis, who has retreated to his island home, has openly admitted resorting to \u201cunconventional methods\u201d to come up with a contingency plan that would have paved the way to the re-embrace of the drachma if Greece was forced out of the euro zone. But he also argued yesterday that it would have been \u201cremiss\u201d of him if his ministry had not also devised a Plan B. On Tuesday the European Union waded in slamming Varoufakis for suggesting that he was forced to hack his ministry\u2019s computer systems because the nation\u2019s \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors had exclusive control of the country\u2019s tax agency. A commission spokeswoman described the claims as \u201cfalse and unfounded.\u201d But the self-styled \u201cerratic Marxist\u201d also has friends in high places with many saying he has been turned into a scapegoat. Writing in the New York Times this week, the Nobel prize winning US economics professor Paul Krugman argued that it would have been highly irresponsible of Varoufakis had he not had a plan. \u201cThe issue now becomes whether Tsipras was right to decide not to invoke this plan in the face of what amounted to extortion from the creditors,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI think he called it wrong, but God knows it was an awesome responsibility \u2014 and we may never know who was right.\u201d Varoufakis responded with his usual aplomb today tweeting: Tsipras has also warned that Greece could face fresh snap elections, if he cannot maintain the support of his party: Tsipras appears to be challenging the 30-or so rebellious government MPs to either shuffle back into line, or shuffle off: That sets the tone for a meeting of Syriza\u2019s central committee on Thursday. That committee could decide to call a new party congress \u2013 either in September or straight away. Let\u2019s get back to Alexis Tsipras\u2019s radio interview, where the Greek PM has warned rebels in his Syriza party to support him or clear off: Some analysts suspect that Syriza will soon split, with the rebellious Left Platform breaking away from the rest of the party. That would allow Tsipras to take a more centrist approach. However, he\u2019s also just ruled out turning Syriza into a social democratic party. Breaking away from Greece, and the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor for financial stability has revealed his worries about the consequences of a US interest rate rise. Speaking to the Guardian, Sir Jon Cunliffe warned that markets are still \u2018quite fragile\u2019. So we can\u2019t assume that a Fed rate hike won\u2019t cause problems. As Cunliffe put it: \u201cIf and when US interest rates go up ... there are concerns about how the market will adjust. This must be the most advertised, well signalled change in monetary policy in the history of man. Nonetheless you don\u2019t know. These are different sorts of markets to the ones we had before.\u201d Cunliffe also warned that new rules to regulate banks should not be watered down, despite pressure from the industry.... Alexis Tsipras has warned radio listeners that Greece could still be forced out of the eurozone. The risk of Grexit won\u2019t be removed until a third bailout deal, and debt relief, is secured, he says. As reported earlier, Bavaria\u2019s prime minister has warned that Grexit is still a risk. Horst Seehofer said: On top of that there would be utter chaos. If Greece were not prepared to reform, a path like that would have to be accepted but one shouldn\u2019t strive for it oneself or organise it.\u201d What defeat?! In defeat, unbeatable? Tsipras has returned to defending the deal he signed up to at the all-night negotiations in Brussels: But what about your referendum, Alexis? Another nugget from Alexis Tsipras\u2019s interview with Sto Konnino 105,5 - he says Greece\u2019s creditors will tackle its debt sustainability in November: For that to happen, Greece would need to agree a third bailout, and then show its lenders that it is sticking to the plan. Alexis Tsipras is denying that Greece could have breezed out of its bailouts if Syriza hadn\u2019t won January\u2019s election: Chris Loukas of radio station Sto Kokkino 105,5 is tweeting the key points from their interview with the PM: Kathimerini are also translating Alexis Tsipras\u2019s radio interview (thanks guys!). The Greek PM is (once again) defending the bailout deal he agreed to this month: Here are some early highlights from Alexis Tsipras\u2019s radio interview, via Enikos. The institutions were not independent or neutral. We should be proud of the battle we have given. The last 6 months has been a period of great conflict. Greek PM Alexis Tsipras is giving a radio interview now. It\u2019s live here (in Greek, obviously) Britain\u2019s City watchdog has fired a warning shot at the banking sector, warning that some firms haven\u2019t done enough to prevent financial benchmarks being manipulated. Following a series of scandals, the FCA is pushing banks to ensure that they are properly overseeing their staff. However: ....the application of the lessons learned from the LIBOR, Forex and Gold cases to other benchmarks had been uneven across the industry and often lacked the urgency required given the severity of recent failings. After getting off to a bumpy start yesterday, negotiations with mission chiefs representing Greece\u2019s creditor institutions will begin today minus one, we have just been told. From Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports The hotly-anticipated arrival of all four mission chiefs representing the EU, ESM, ECB and IMF will have to wait until tomorrow, the Guardian has just been told. After much confusion, a finance ministry official has confirmed that the Rumanian economist Delia Velculescu, who will be heading the IMF team to Greece, will not be flying in until tomorrow. The well-placed source told me \u201cThere\u2019s no particular reason for the delay. But I can confirm she won\u2019t be coming in today, she\u2019ll be arriving tomorrow.\u201d The official rejected suggestions that the delay was directly linked to difficulties with the IMF, which of all the creditor bodies has taken the toughest stand with Greece. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no mystery to it,\u201d said the official adding that it remained unclear how long the inspection tour would last. Velculescu comes with a reputation. The Rumanian economist who will be reporting to former mission chief Poul Thomsen (now head of the IMF\u2019s European department) was previously appointed mission chief for Cyprus where her demanding stance earned her the nickname Dracula. US-trained, she will be tough with Athens applying prior actions in the coming weeks. Already the talks are mired in dispute amid speculation that the Greek government will have to pass more restrictive measures through parliament to qualify for bailout funds. Rumour has been rife that creditors will demand further prior actions not least pension cuts and tax hikes on profits made by farmers \u2013 neuralgic issues bound to trigger further anger in Syriza. In a statement the Greek finance minister rejected any suggestion that the government might be forced to impose further prior actions. \u201cAs far as reports of prior actions are concerned it should be noted that neither in the agreement of the European summit on the 12 of July nor in the two letters that the Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos sent to the ESM was there the slightest hint of a third package of prior actions.\u201d The latest talks, the ministry said, would focus on changes to the Greek pension system labour reform, fiscal policy and market regulation. Here\u2019s a few gems from the deluge of corporate news this morning: And if you want more, check out FastFT\u2019s full summary of this morning\u2019s results: UK stocks: the morning\u2019s movers and shakers Greek stock market investors need to stay patient. The Athens exchange won\u2019t open today, because the government hasn\u2019t issued a ministerial decree to allow trading to resume. It could open on Thursday, more than a month after capital controls were introduced. You need nerves of steel to play the Chinese stock market right now. The Shanghai composite index ended the day up 3.5%, after a late surge of buying drove many shares up 10% - the maximum allowed in one day. Earlier, the market had been heading for another fall, before a rush of optimism swept brokerages. Beijing\u2019s latest steps to stabilise the markets by buying shares and injecting liquidity may be paying off. That still leaves traders nursing big losses after Monday\u2019s 8.5% plunge\u201d For all the talk of clean-ups and fresh starts, Britain\u2019s banks are still paying for the mistakes of the past. This morning, Barclays has set aside \u00a31.8bn to cover the cost of compensating customers caught up in a string of scandals. It took the shine off a 25% jump in profits. Our City editor Jill Treanor reports: The figure was revealed as John McFarlane, the chairman who is standing in as chief executive following the ousting of Antony Jenkins earlier this month, pledged to accelerate the disposal of risky businesses, cut costs at the scandal-hit bank and change the dividend policy. Included in the provision is a further \u00a3600m for the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal and \u00a3250m to compensate customers with packaged bank accounts that had other products, such as insurance, attached to them. Shareholders seem happy, though - Barclays shares are up 2.6% in early trading. There\u2019s not much sign of Greek angst in the European stock markets this morning. Shares are higher across the board, helped by the news that China\u2019s stock market surged by over 3% in late trading: Investors are poised to hear the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on interest rates tonight, and to digest the accompanying statement. FXTM Chief Market Analyst Jameel Ahmad explains: What everyone wants to know from tonight\u2019s FOMC announcement is clear guidance on the likely time frame to expect an US interest rate increase. We have repeatedly been told that US interest rates will rise at some point later this year, but the timing on when this will occur still remains largely unclear. The prime minister of Bavaria, one of Angela Merkel\u2019s allies, has warned that there would be \u2018utter chaos\u2019 if Greece were to leave the eurozone. However, it might also be inevitable, if Athens can\u2019t implement the reforms that creditor demand, Horst Seehofer added. Seehofer made the comments in an interview with German newspaper Die Welt, published in today\u2019s edition. Reuters has the key quotes: \u201cNo one can predict the consequences of a Grexit other than that a lot of Greece\u2019s debts would have to be written off and at the same time monetary help would be necessary.\u201d \u201cOn top of that there would be utter chaos. If Greece were not prepared to reform, a path like that would have to be accepted but one shouldn\u2019t strive for it oneself or organise it.\u201d Negotiations over the third Greek bailout deal are going well, European commissioner Pierre Moscovici told French radio listeners this morning. Interviewed on Europe 1 radio, Moscovici said talks were taking place in \u201cgood conditions\u201d, declaring that: \u201cGrexit is behind us.\u201d The priority now, he added, is to create closer integration in the eurozone and drive through economic reforms to lower unemployment. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up..... Technical talks between the Greek government and its creditors will continue today, as Athens tries to secure a third bailout by mid-August. Top officials from the European Commission, European Central Bank and European Stability Mechanism should all in the capital by the end of the day, ready to take over negotiations by Friday. Delia Velculescu, the IMF\u2019s lead negotiator, arrives tomorrow. Technical teams have been assessing the state of the Greek economy so they can draw up plausible new fiscal targets. Greek media report that they now expect a deep recession in 2015, given the severe damage caused by a month of capital controls: Also coming up.... Tonight, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision on interest rates. They\u2019re very likely to hold them at 0.25% - but for how much longer? Speculation of a September rate hike have already helped to drive emerging market currencies down to a 15-year low. And there\u2019s also a flurry of corporate news, as companies clear the decks before the August break - including Barclays, Sky, Antofagasta and Foxtons.",

Nevertheless, this doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t happen, especially since the statement sounded a bit more upbeat on the economy.</p> <p>The policy statement was largely unchanged, with only some minor tweaks to acknowledge the improvement in the economic data. The housing sector is described as showing \u201cadditional\u201d rather than \u201csome\u201d improvement, jobs gains are now thought to be \u201csolid\u201d and the unemployment rate is \u201cdeclining\u201d rather than \u201cremained steady\u201d as before.</p> <p>These tweaks fall well short of a clear hint that a rate hike is coming at the next meeting in September. Note the Fed flagged up a hike at the meeting before the first rise in the tightening cycle in 2004. Nonetheless, Yellen has recently stressed that each meeting is \u201clive\u201d and \u201cdata dependent\u201d so this was always unlikely. The more positive tone of the statement is a sign that the first rate hike is coming closer.</p> <p>Given that in June 15 of 17 officials expected rates to rise this year and 10 of 17 anticipated two 25 basis-point increases, there\u2019s a good change that rates will rise at two of the three meetings left this year. September is very much in play, especially if international risks continue to recede and core inflation continues to strengthen.</p> <p>Our view is that the Fed will raise rates at the September meeting and to 0.50-0.75% at year-end. Perhaps more importantly, stronger wage growth and core inflation will prompt rates to rise by more than currently anticipated by the markets, taking them to 2.25-2.50% by end-2016.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55b92311e4b04b785e6ef636\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-29T19:04:29.121Z\">8.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tom Porcelli</strong>, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, says the Fed will want to ensure that the two employment reports between the July and September meetings aren\u2019t \u201cduds\u201d before signalling that they\u2019re ready to raise borrowing costs.</p> <p>Janet Yellen and colleagues will also be watching for any global risks flaring up, which could knock a rate rise off course.

      "bodyText": "It remains a mystery why Antony Jenkins received a \u201cunanimous\u201d vote of no confidence from Barclays\u2019 non-executive directors. There were no nasties lurking in Wednesday\u2019s interim figures beyond the usual parade of provisions, including another \u00a3600m for mis-selling payment protection insurance (PPI). This was Barclays\u2019 best half-year for a while. Targets for capital and leverage ratios in 2016 have been reached already. The former chief executive will collect a payoff of at least \u00a32.5m to ease the bruising to his ego but, by the standard of these things, he\u2019s entitled to feel miffed. A need for greater dynamism was the semi-official explanation for his exit. But, if that\u2019s the path Barclays wants to tread, John McFarlane, newly installed as executive chairman, needs to improve his own game. He came bearing two ambitions, neither of which could be described as game-changing. The first is to reduce Barclays\u2019 cost-to-income ratio from 70% to the mid-50s. Nice if it happens, but McFarlane offered few details. He expects the number of staff to fall but dodged the questions of where, when and how many. If, instead, higher revenues are supposed to do the hard work, the wait may be long. McFarlane sees some opportunities for \u201cabove market\u201d growth but stated plainly: \u201cWe are not going to be a growth stock.\u201d The second ambition is to \u201caccelerate\u201d (a favourite word) the sell-off of non-core assets. These stand at \u00a357bn and the plan is to reduce the figure to \u00a320bn in 2017. Again, that\u2019s fine as far as it goes, but the prices at which the assets depart also matter. A seller in a hurry usually forfeits some negotiating clout. Meanwhile, the future size of Barclays\u2019 investment bank remains in the air. McFarlane is \u201cvery pleased\u201d with its recent progress. On the other hand, he says \u201cit\u2019s not our obligation\u201d to build a European investment banking champion and he agreed that the American titans are eating the Europeans\u2019 lunch. A slimmer Barclays can live on a lower-calorie diet but there\u2019s a danger that, once you\u2019ve retreated from your global ambitions, you end up chasing morsels. To be fair to McFarlane, he\u2019s been in the executive hot seat for only three weeks, so it would be wrong to expect a fully formed plan to improve shareholders\u2019 lot. Yet the share price has improved 10% since Jenkins\u2019s downfall. Why? Maybe McFarlane\u2019s Scots growl just conveys greater determination than Jenkins\u2019s soporific slogans. Other than that, though, what\u2019s changed? GSK\u2019s medicine takes effect In the first five years of Sir Andrew Witty\u2019s reign, GlaxoSmithKline came fourth in a 10-strong Big Pharma club in terms of total returns to shareholders. Over the past 18 months, the company has been bottom of the class. Last year\u2019s profit warning, which followed a bribery scandal in China, triggered a wider loss of confidence in Witty\u2019s remodelling of GSK. Investors could see, up close, the damaging impact on sales from the arrival of generic competition to its key asthma drug, Advair. But it was harder to believe that a three-part asset shuffle with Novartis could provide compensating growth. Many wondered whether the dividend, the stock\u2019s main appeal, would survive another setback. Such worries won\u2019t disappear overnight but they look smaller after Wednesday\u2019s first-half numbers. Sales and profits were slightly ahead of City forecasts and Witty can now make the important boast that growth from new pharmaceuticals, meaning those launched in the past three years, are more than offsetting the declines from Advair. There is also a hint that the product pipeline, containing 40 potential drugs and vaccines in later-stage development, could do better. Witty has announced a research and development event in November, GSK\u2019s first in a decade. One assumes he thinks he\u2019ll have something interesting to say. If so, 2015 ought to mark a turning point. Earnings per share will be whacked at a \u201chigh-teen percentage rate\u201d this year but then it\u2019s supposed to be double-digit increases all the way until 2020. It should be possible: vaccines and consumer products, both boosted by the deals with Novartis, are fundamentally stable. For believers in the dividend, the yield is 5.8%. Not bad. Chinese insecurities Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is a politician at heart and may hope to be again. But isn\u2019t the IMF supposed to be a body that believes in market forces? Instead, Lagarde offered an extraordinarily generous view of the Chinese authorities\u2019 efforts to prop up local share prices on Wednesday. Observers should not be surprised that China wants to prevent \u201cdisorderly functioning\u201d of its markets, she said. This, apparently, is \u201cthe duty of central authorities\u201d. Really? China is shovelling state funds into a market where prices are still up 70% year-on-year and the state-owned media is desperately trying to encourage citizens into these dangerous waters. The job of the IMF, surely, is to point out that such measures will only damage outsiders\u2019 long-term confidence in China.",

The FCA has levied fines of \u00a3700m on a number of firms for rigging Libor, while global penalties for rigging forex markets have topped \u00a36bn. Experts warned more firms could be fined in the future. Simon Morris, a financial services partner at the law firm CMS said: \u201cBenchmark manipulation came close to shattering the City\u2019s reputation for good, so it\u2019s surprising that the FCA has found a lax approach in some firms to putting things right. This report is a clear wake-up call, and if things haven\u2019t speeded up by the autumn we can expect the next round of multimillion-pound fines to commence.\u201d The regulator is writing to all 12 of the firms it visited and has published its findings to ensure that all City firms are able to respond its concerns. Tracey McDermott, director of supervision at the FCA, said: \u201cWe have seen widespread historical misconduct in relation to benchmarks. It is now critical that firms act to restore trust and confidence in the system. Firms should have in place systems to manage the risks posed by benchmark activities and to address the weaknesses that have previously been identified.\u201d The FCA is asking firms to comply with new standards set out by the global body IOSCO (International Organisation of Securities Commissions), which has set out definitions of benchmarks and how they should operate. The City regulator also said firms needed to think about the consequences of any decisions to stop participating in setting benchmarks as pulling out could have an impact on clients and the integrity of the market. \u201cThe scope and pace of change was uneven across different benchmark and benchmark activities. It was disappointing that most firms had not yet taken all the appropriate steps to identify and then manage fairly and effectively relevant conflicts of interest. Some firms were still not able to identify all the benchmarks they administered, submitted data to or published,\u201d the FCA\u2019s on-site visits found.",

      "bodyText": "Chinese share prices have bounced back after the latest emergency measures by policymakers to underpin the country\u2019s fragile stock markets appeared to have increased confidence. Investors in China\u2019s markets have endured a white knuckle ride in recent weeks, with prices on the Shanghai Composite index plunging by 8.5% on Monday alone \u2013 the sharpest sell-off in eight years \u2013 as trading in many stocks was suspended. But following a second day of declines the index closed up 3.5% on Wednesday. Beijing has again signalled its determination to restore calm to rattled markets, including providing loans to buy shares and put a floor under falling prices. The latest measures followed a series of moves in recent weeks, including banning short-selling. The more stable mood in Shanghai was echoed in the US, where the Dow Jones industrial average was trading up 101 points, or 0.6%, at 17,731, at lunchtime. In London, the FTSE 100 index also closed up 1.2% at 6,631. However, some analysts also fear the bursting of the Chinese stock market bubble in recent weeks may augur a downturn in the wider economy. Chinese GDP growth has slowed from the double-digit annual rates seen in the runup to the global financial crisis. This follows a deliberate shift by the authorities from export-dependent growth to stronger domestic consumption. The latest official figures showed annual growth of 7% \u2013 in line with Beijing\u2019s target \u2013 but analysts at City consultancy Fathom say their calculations, based on measures including electricity use and bank lending, suggest the true rate is less than half that. Fathom\u2019s Laura Eaton said Beijing may eventually be forced to engineer a sharp depreciation in the yuan in order to restore competitiveness and increase growth. \u201cAs China tries out the full range of its policy levers, we believe that eventually it will resort to exchange-rate depreciation,\u201d she said. Salman Ahmed, of asset manager Lombard Odier, said China\u2019s vast $4tn (\u00a32.6tn) foreign currency reserves meant it had considerable capacity to continue underpinning financial markets, but that the volatility of recent weeks would still hit economic growth. \u201cGrowth is likely to take a further blow as both wealth effects and sentiment, hit as a result of equity market volatility, pass through the system,\u201d he said. \u201cAlready the heavy falls in commodities show that this dynamic has accelerated and, more importantly, is likely to remain with us going forward.\u201d There have also been growing questions about whether such direct intervention in financial markets undermines China\u2019s attempt to prove its credentials as a fully fledged, free market economy. \u201cSome of the things they\u2019ve done have been, to a degree, irrational,\u201d said Sat Duhra, fund manager at Henderson Global Investors. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that if China does want to be seen as a credible destination for foreign capital, then some of these things have to be more measured and thought out.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has sparked uproar in local communities by confirming it will close nine shops across the UK, putting hundreds of jobs at risk. The closures include stores in Birmingham, London and Wales and are a result of M&amp;S attempting to modernise its store estate as shoppers switch their spending online. On Wednesday, the retailer said 430 workers would be affected, but that they would be offered jobs at nearby M&amp;S stores. The closures are the latest in a collection announced by high-profile British retailers. Tesco said in January it would be closing 43 stores, while Morrisons is shutting 23 stores and one in four Homebase shops are closing too. M&amp;S will close three traditional food and clothing shops, one Simply Food store, and five Outlet stores that sell end-of-season clothing. The Outlet stores are in Walsall, Aldershot, Pontypridd in Wales, Hounslow in west London, and Royal Quays in North Shields. The three full-line stores are in Stevenage, Wood Green in north London, and The Fort shopping park in Castle Bromwich near Birmingham, while the Simply Food shop is in Shirley, also near Birmingham. Jack Dromey, Labour MP for Erdington, said the closures near Birmingham were \u201ca blow to the local economy and its employees\u201d. More than 11,000 people have signed a petition in Aldershot since M&amp;S revealed in June that it was considering closing the store in the Hampshire town. The company also faced questions about the store at its annual meeting last month and \u201cSave our M&amp;S\u201d banners appeared across the area. M&amp;S has been in Aldershot since 1922 and at its present location since 1927. The closure will leave Athe town without an M&amp;S. The local council said the decision was a \u201cbolt from the blue\u201d. The retailer has 852 shops in the UK, including 302 traditional clothing and food stores, 46 Outlet stores, and 504 Simply Foods. This is far more than its rivals. John Lewis, for example, has 44 stores in Britain. M&amp;S is attempting to adapt its collection of stores to cope with the rise in online sales and a slowdown in clothing sales. Marc Bolland, its chief executive, has warned that M&amp;S would not open any extra space to sell clothing in the UK, meaning that new openings in Longbridge in the West Midlands and Charlton in south London are being offset by closures. However, the growth of M&amp;S\u2019s food sales means it has committed to opening 250 new Simply Food stores by 2017. M&amp;S said the closure of the Outlet stores was linked to the company managing its stock levels more efficiently. This meant those stores had less to sell. Hugo Adams, director of property at M&amp;S, said: \u201cWe are managing our store estate to ensure it is fit for the future of M&amp;S and will continue to ensure we are in the best locations to serve our customers. We have a clear property strategy, which involves opening 250 new Simply Food stores and further improving the quality of our general merchandise space.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer has sparked uproar in local communities by confirming it will close nine shops across the UK, putting hundreds of jobs at risk.</p> <p>The closures include stores in Birmingham, London and Wales and are a result of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marksspencer\">M&amp;S</a> attempting to modernise its store estate as shoppers switch their spending online.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the retailer said 430 workers would be affected, but that they would be offered jobs at nearby M&amp;S stores.</p> <p>The closures are the latest in a collection announced by high-profile British retailers. Tesco said in January it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/28/tesco-names-43-stores-to-close\">would be closing 43 stores</a>, while Morrisons is shutting 23 stores and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/22/homebase-to-close-quarter-stores-diy\">one in four Homebase shops are closing</a> too.</p> <p>M&amp;S will close three traditional food and clothing shops, one Simply Food store, and five Outlet stores that sell end-of-season clothing.</p> <p>The Outlet stores are in Walsall, Aldershot, Pontypridd in Wales, Hounslow in west London, and Royal Quays in North Shields. The three full-line stores are in Stevenage, Wood Green in north London, and The Fort shopping park in Castle Bromwich near Birmingham, while the Simply Food shop is in Shirley, also near Birmingham.</p> <p>Jack Dromey, Labour MP for Erdington, said the closures near Birmingham were \u201ca blow to the local economy and its employees\u201d.</p> <p>More than 11,000 people have signed a petition in Aldershot since M&amp;S revealed in June that it was considering closing the store in the Hampshire town. The company also faced questions about the store at its annual meeting last month and \u201cSave our M&amp;S\u201d banners appeared across the area.</p> <p>M&amp;S has been in Aldershot since 1922 and at its present location since 1927. The closure will leave Athe town without an M&amp;S. The local council said the decision was a \u201cbolt from the blue\u201d.</p> <p>The retailer has 852 shops in the UK, including 302 traditional clothing and food stores, 46 Outlet stores, and 504 Simply Foods. This is far more than its rivals. John Lewis, for example, has 44 stores in Britain.</p> <p>M&amp;S is attempting to adapt its collection of stores to cope with the rise in online sales and a slowdown in clothing sales.</p> <p>Marc Bolland, its chief executive, has warned that M&amp;S would not open any extra space to sell clothing in the UK, meaning that new openings in Longbridge in the West Midlands and Charlton in south London are being offset by closures.</p> <p>However, the growth of M&amp;S\u2019s food sales means it has committed to opening 250 new Simply Food stores by 2017.</p> <p>M&amp;S said the closure of the Outlet stores was linked to the company managing its stock levels more efficiently. This meant those stores had less to sell.</p> <p>Hugo Adams, director of property at M&amp;S, said: \u201cWe are managing our store estate to ensure it is fit for the future of M&amp;S and will continue to ensure we are in the best locations to serve our customers. We have a clear property strategy, which involves opening 250 new Simply Food stores and further improving the quality of our general merchandise space.\u201d</p>",

    "webTitle": "GlaxoSmithKline CEO: business stabilising despite China slowdown", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The GlaxoSmithKline CEO, Sir Andrew Witty, said the Chinese drug market has slowed down dramatically over the past year but insisted that the drugmaker\u2019s own business there is stabilising, as it unveiled second-quarter results that beat City expectations thanks to strong sales of new HIV drugs. Witty also flagged up 40 new drugs and vaccines that are in mid- to late-stage development, half of which are expected to be on the market or filed for regulatory approval by 2020. He highlighted a new shingles vaccine, as well as treatments for chronic lung disease, severe asthma, anaemia and heart disease. He said the company\u2019s research and development day in November \u2013 the first since 2003 \u2013 will be a \u201ckey moment\u201d, when it will update investors about its new medicines. The turmoil in China\u2019s stock markets in recent weeks has raised concerns over the state of the world\u2019s second-largest economy, which has been slowing. Witty said: \u201cThere is no doubt that we are seeing that the overall market place in China slowed quite dramatically over the last year or so. For our own business, we have seen some pretty good signs of stabilisation.\u201d GSK\u2019s sales in China fell 14% in the latest quarter, but he said this reflected price reductions, which should boost sales volumes in coming months, as well as disposals of some products. He added: \u201cOverall, we are feeling pretty good about where we are in China. We are obviously glad to have put behind us the events of the last year or so and we feel that we have a very robust approach to how we now go forward in China, which is very much in step with what the authorities of China want to see.\u201d GSK has come through a damaging corruption scandal in China, for which it paid a \u00a3300m fine to the government in Beijing. It is still being investigated by the UK Serious Fraud Office and the US Department of Justice, which are both looking into allegations of bribery in China and other countries. Witty said GSK had cleaned up its act, becoming the \u201cfirst and only company\u201d to commit to stopping payments to doctors to speak on its behalf. This has been implemented in China and the UK and is being rolled out globally. GSK is also the first company to stop bonus payments tied to prescriptions to sales representatives around the world. Other drugmakers are expected to follow suit. Britain\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical company reported sales of \u00a35.9bn in the second quarter, up 7% at constant exchange rates. Core operating profit fell 3% to \u00a31.35bn. The group said the \u201cstandout performance\u201d came from its new HIV drugs, Tivicay and Triumeq, which vindicated its decision in May to hold on to its HIV venture, after plans to spin it off. It is the first full quarter since GSK sold its cancer business to Novartis and bought the Swiss group\u2019s vaccines division, while also boosting its consumer health business through a joint venture. But it will take time for the business revamp to pay off, with another fall in core earnings per share expected this year, before a return to double-digit growth next year. GSK is battling sales declines for its ageing blockbuster lung treatment Advair/Seretide. The drugmaker\u2019s malaria vaccine is the world\u2019s first and took 30 years to develop. It received the green light from European regulators last week. Witty said it could take between 12-18 months before it is rolled out in sub-Saharan Africa, as it still needs approval from the World Health Organisation and national governments. The shot will be sold on a not-for-profit basis, at a few dollars per dose. Ketan Patel, a senior investment analyst at EdenTree Investment Management, said: \u201cInvestors in GlaxoSmithKline will have been buoyed by the recent pipeline success, with the approval of malarial vaccine Mosquirix. However, the company has tested the patience of long-term investors over the past few years. \u201cThe bribery scandal in China led to a large fine, declining returns on capital and faltering sales in its respiratory franchise in the US, and the impact on share price performance has been marked.\u201d Patel added, however, that the company has the healthiest pipeline in the global pharmaceutical sector with more than 250 products. Citi analyst Andrew Baum said: \u201cThe weak performance of China, US Breo and Anoro and EU Advair [all lung drugs] suggested respite is not imminent. GSK\u2019s pipeline is undervalued but the most interesting compounds remain in the early stages of development.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Barclays makes further provision for scandals and cuts costs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The temporary head of Barclays has warned that jobs are on the line as the bank embarks on a plan to cut costs and accelerate the disposal of risky operations. John McFarlane attempted to stamp his authority on the bank just weeks after stepping up to executive chairman after the axing of chief executive Antony Jenkins. Speaking as Barclays set aside \u00a31.8bn in the first half of the year to compensate customers for a string of mis-selling scandals and fines, McFarlane said he was pleased with the performance of the troublesome investment banking arm but conceded the unit could not compete with Wall Street rivals as a global player. He also appeared to question the current structure of the bank, which unites high street banking, credit cards and investment banking, as he discussed the bank\u2019s languishing share price. \u201cIs there a conglomerate discount? The answer frankly is that we cannot validate this because our businesses are not all performing,\u201d he said. McFarlane, promoted to stand-in boss only two months after becoming non-executive chairman, congratulated Jenkins after the bank reported first-half profits up 25% to \u00a33.1bn. Jenkins was ousted this month after losing the confidence of the board. The \u00a31.8bn provision includes a further \u00a3600m for the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal and \u00a3250m to compensate customers with packaged bank accounts that had other products, such as insurance, attached to them. Fines for rigging foreign exchange markets also dented the results. McFarlane, who is keen to bolster returns for shareholders, surprised analysts by saying he would \u201cnot be as ambitious with dividends\u201d for this year as his predecessor. The payout to shareholders will be held steady at 6.5p but McFarlane said: \u201cAccelerating the dividend is probably the single biggest priority we\u2019ve got.\u201d The shares, up 10% since McFarlane stepped in three weeks ago, closed up 1.5% at 284p. The executive chairman is speeding up other plans put in place by Jenkins, cutting the non-core division to \u00a320bn by 2017, faster than the target of \u00a350bn by 2016.. The cost-income ratio \u2013 a measure of efficiency \u2013 is to fall to the \u201cmid-50s\u201d from 70% now \u2013 sparking questions about further job cuts on top of the 19,000 announced year ago. McFarlane said no decision had been made but, added: \u201cThe company will get smaller in terms of headcount.\u201d The bank employs 132,000 people worldwide. There was better news for users of high street branches after 100 were closed last year, taking the UK network to 1,448. McFarlane said he intended to slow closures. \u201cI am particularly hostile to closing the last bank in town,\u201d he said. McFarlane said there would be \u201cincreased focus on our core franchises: what we are good at, where we are good at it and what is financially compelling to us.\u201d \u201cThat means aligning our effort and investment behind our key franchises of UK personal and commercial banking, investment banking in Europe and the US, our cards business, and on Africa. We will also act quickly to curtail activity which is marginal or which will not deliver the return on equity we require,\u201d he said. Much of the focus was on his views about the investment bank \u2013 the powerhouse of the business until the 2012 Libor rigging scandal forced a rethink of the operation . Its profit rose 36%, to \u00a31.4bn, faster than any other division. \u201cThere is an issue about Europe needing an investment banking champion, we don\u2019t really see that as our obligation. If we were able to do that, that would be really nice to do,\u201d he said, although added that the US was more important for Barclays investment banking ambitions. He also said Barclays intended to comply with the UK requirement to erect a ringfence between its high street and investment banking operations by applying for a new banking licence from the Bank of England. McFarlane has a reputation in the City for bolstering share prices after he temporarily took the helm of Aviva in 2012 when Andrew Moss was ousted as chief executive. A Scot who has also had a lengthy career in Australia, McFarlane described Barclays as \u201ccumbersome\u201d. \u201cWe could sharpen up the growth ... we need to sharpen up the productivity of the company, we need to sharpen up the decision making,\u201d he said. He said the bank had \u201cbroken the back\u201d of the cultural changes that it has committed to implementing since the \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor in 2012. However, the results contained pages of legal warnings about potential penalties related to interest rate rigging and other benchmarks. It also repeated that it was fighting a \u00a350m fine from City regulators related to fundraising from Middle Eastern investors in 2008, as well as facing an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and possible civil action over the same matter. The Barclaycard business reported record profits of \u00a3795m and was being primed for growth in the US. The high street operations reported a 4% rise in profits to \u00a31.5bn. The successor for Jenkins looks likely to be external after McFarlane said there was \u201cprobably more fertile ground internationally rather than domestically\u201d. The bank\u2019s finance director, Tushar Morzaria, refused to comment on whether he was a candidate to replace Jenkins.",

      "body": "<p>The temporary head of Barclays has warned that jobs are on the line as the bank embarks on a plan to cut costs and accelerate the disposal of risky operations.</p> <p>John McFarlane attempted to stamp his authority on the bank just weeks after stepping up to executive chairman after the axing of chief executive Antony Jenkins.</p> <p>Speaking as Barclays set aside \u00a31.8bn in the first half of the year to compensate customers for a string of mis-selling scandals and fines, McFarlane said he was pleased with the performance of the troublesome investment banking arm but conceded the unit could not compete with Wall Street rivals as a global player. </p> <p>He also appeared to question the current structure of the bank, which unites high street banking, credit cards and investment banking, as he discussed the bank\u2019s languishing share price. \u201cIs there a conglomerate discount? The answer frankly is that we cannot validate this because our businesses are not all performing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McFarlane, promoted to stand-in boss only two months after becoming non-executive chairman, congratulated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/barclays-fires-chief-executive-antony-jenkins\">Jenkins</a> after the bank reported first-half profits <a href=\"http://www.home.barclays/content/dam/barclayspublic/docs/InvestorRelations/ResultAnnouncements/2015HYResults/Barclays_2015_Interim_Results_Announcement.pdf\">up 25% to \u00a33.1bn</a>. Jenkins was ousted this month after losing the confidence of the board. The \u00a31.8bn provision includes a further \u00a3600m for the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal and \u00a3250m to compensate customers with packaged bank accounts that had other products, such as insurance, attached to them. Fines for rigging foreign exchange markets also dented the results.</p> <p>McFarlane, who is keen to bolster returns for shareholders, surprised analysts by saying he would \u201cnot be as ambitious with dividends\u201d for this year as his predecessor. </p> <p>The payout to shareholders will be held steady at 6.5p but McFarlane said: \u201cAccelerating the dividend is probably the single biggest priority we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p> <p>The shares, up 10% since McFarlane stepped in three weeks ago, closed up 1.5% at 284p.</p> <p>The executive chairman is speeding up other plans put in place by Jenkins, cutting the non-core division to \u00a320bn by 2017, faster than the target of \u00a350bn by 2016.. The cost-income ratio \u2013 a measure of efficiency \u2013 is to fall to the \u201cmid-50s\u201d from 70% now \u2013 sparking questions about further job cuts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/08/barclays-to-cut-19000-jobs-scale-back-investment-bank-antony-jenkins\">on top of the 19,000 announced year ago</a>. McFarlane said no decision had been made but, added: \u201cThe company will get smaller in terms of headcount.\u201d The bank employs 132,000 people worldwide. </p> <p>There was better news for users of high street branches after 100 were closed last year, taking the UK network to 1,448. McFarlane said he intended to slow closures. \u201cI am particularly hostile to closing the last bank in town,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McFarlane said there would be \u201cincreased focus on our core franchises: what we are good at, where we are good at it and what is financially compelling to us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat means aligning our effort and investment behind our key franchises of UK personal and commercial banking, investment banking in Europe and the US, our cards business, and on Africa. We will also act quickly to curtail activity which is marginal or which will not deliver the return on equity we require,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Much of the focus was on his views about the investment bank \u2013 the powerhouse of the business until <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine\">the 2012 Libor rigging scandal forced a rethink of the operation</a> . Its profit rose 36%, to \u00a31.4bn, faster than any other division. </p> <p>\u201cThere is an issue about Europe needing an investment banking champion, we don\u2019t really see that as our obligation. If we were able to do that, that would be really nice to do,\u201d he said, although added that the US was more important for Barclays investment banking ambitions.</p> <p> He also said Barclays intended to comply with the UK requirement to erect a ringfence between its high street and investment banking operations by applying for a new banking licence from the Bank of England.</p> <p>McFarlane has a reputation in the City for bolstering share prices after he temporarily <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/08/aviva-chief-executive-steps-down\">took the helm of Aviva in 2012 when Andrew Moss was ousted as chief executive</a>. A Sco<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/john-mcfarlane-barclays-reputation-antony-jenkins\">t who has also had a lengthy career in Australia</a>, McFarlane described Barclays as \u201ccumbersome\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWe could sharpen up the growth ... we need to sharpen up the productivity of the company, we need to sharpen up the decision making,\u201d he said. </p> <p>He said the bank had \u201cbroken the back\u201d of the cultural changes that it has committed to implementing since the \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor in 2012. However, the results contained pages of legal warnings about potential penalties related to interest rate rigging and other benchmarks. It also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/21/sfo-mulls-barclays-deal-over-banking-crisis-funding\">repeated that it was fighting a \u00a350m fine from City regulators related to fundraising from Middle Eastern investors</a> in 2008, as well as facing an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and possible civil action over the same matter. </p> <p> The Barclaycard business reported record profits of \u00a3795m and was being primed for growth in the US. The high street operations reported a 4% rise in profits to \u00a31.5bn.</p> <p>The successor for Jenkins looks likely to be external after McFarlane said there was \u201cprobably more fertile ground internationally rather than domestically\u201d. The bank\u2019s finance director, Tushar Morzaria, refused to comment on whether he was a candidate to replace Jenkins.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A leading Bank of England policymaker has expressed concerns about the \u201cfragility\u201d of the global financial markets as he warned against any watering down of regulatory reforms eight years on from the financial crisis. \u201cI do think financial markets at the moment are quite fragile,\u201d said Sir Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor for financial stability. Cunliffe said he was not too concerned about the recent sharp falls in China feeding through to other stock markets but highlighted a lack of liquidity in global markets. This, he said, could make it more difficult to sell some investments in strained circumstances. The Bank of England warned earlier this month of six potential risks to financial stability - the global environment, the reduction of market liquidity in some markets, Britain\u2019s current account deficit, the UK\u2019s housing market, the \u00a330bn of fines paid by banks since the 2008 financial crisis and the risk of cyber attacks. At the time focus was on the ongoing crisis in Greece and its position in the eurozone. Cunliffe said his concern is not about potential losses for investors but more about the impact it could have on financial stability. \u201cPeople seem to be underpricing liquidity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how they [the markets] will behave under stress and we are watching that very carefully.\u201d \u201cIf and when US interest rates go up ... there are concerns about how the market will adjust. This must be the most advertised, well signalled change in monetary policy in the history of man. Nonetheless you don\u2019t know. These are different sorts of markets to the ones we had before,\u201d he said. Cunliffe was speaking as he prepared to deliver a speech to a City audience in which he warned against rowing back against regulatory reforms put in place since the 2008 crisis in any attempt to fuel growth. He said that Britain\u2019s biggest banks are still too big fail and needed to justify their investment banking operations to investors. While policymakers had new powers since the 2008 crisis, allowing banks to collapse without taxpayer bailouts had still not been resolved. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve solved or resolved too big too fail,\u201d said Cunliffe, who was involved in the bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland, in which taxpayers still have a 79% stake. \u201cWhether we could deal with an RBS now or not I don\u2019t know. My own view is there are still some key piece of the puzzle to put in place,\u201d he said, referring to ways to convert bank debt into equity to absorb losses. \u201cWe\u2019re closer but we\u2019re not completely there yet,\u201d said Cunliffe. He also said investors were questioning the structure of big banks which combine high street banks and investment banks - the so-called universal banking model - by reducing their stock market value through an \u201cagglomeration discount\u201d. \u201cBanks have to look at what they do and there has to be a good market reason for what they do,\u201d said Cunliffe. \u201cShareholders are saying if you want to be really big what is your commercial justification for being really big\u201d, he said. Saying he was not against universal banking, Cunliffe said: \u201cMy impression is that lending to the real economy in the UK is reasonably profitable, where banks are really having to think quite hard is what parts of the investment banking world do I want to be be in\u201d. He is warning against attempts to reduce regulation in an attempt to facilitate economic growth, while acknowledging some changes will need to be made. \u201cYou need a stable financial system in order to allow growth,\u201d said Cunliffe. The rules requiring a ringfence to be erected between high street and investment banks were still relevant, he said. These reforms, recommended by Sir John Vickers, remain the subject of debate after HSBC said it was creating a new headquarters in Birmingham for its ringfenced bank and indicated it could revive the Midland bank name. \u201cWe have to carry more insurance\u201d than other countries because of the relative size of the UK economy to the banking sector. \u201cThat need is still there,\u201d said Cunliffe when asked about the need for the Vickers reforms. \u201cYou hear people in the industry say we can\u2019t grow now because regulation has got too tight. A better way of looking at is show us where the problem is ... We put (regulation) in place to avoid the sort of crisis we just have had. It may have been a once in 70 year event but we are eight years into the recovery. It\u2019s not a small thing when it happens and you have to look at growth over the whole period.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The high street baker Greggs has posted a 51% rise in profits for the first half of the year thanks to strong demand for its breakfast range and healthier sandwiches and flatbreads. The company raised its full-year guidance for the second time in three months as a result of favourable market conditions and well received improvements to its products and shops. Greggs, which is based in Newcastle and operates 1,664 retail outlets, reported profit before tax of \u00a325.6m in the six months to 4 July, up from \u00a316.9m in the same period last year. Sales increased 6.4% to \u00a3398m. \u201cWe are confident of delivering a year of good growth slightly ahead of our previous expectations,\u201d said Roger Whiteside, chief executive of Greggs. In April, the company said shareholders would share a \u00a320m special dividend after the baker beat its expectations, again on the back of a growing customer appetite for products with fewer than 400 calories. Whiteside said there was a significant growth in breakfast sales as well as from the extension of the range of lower-calorie sandwiches and flatbreads. He said there had been a good reaction from customers to shop refurbishments that saw 118 refits and 12 cafe conversions. Shares in the group, which have more than doubled over the last year, rose almost 3% to \u00a312.17, valuing the business at \u00a31.2bn. Under Whiteside, the company has pushed coffee sales, introduced free-range omelettes and porridge for breakfast and added extra seating to branches, diversifying from its traditional image as a purveyor of sausage rolls, pies and pasties. Greggs was in the doldrums two years ago, forced to publish two profit warnings in 2013. But Whiteside\u2019s overhaul helped push profits up 41% last year. The Hollywood actor Jake Gyllenhaal recently revealed himself to be a fan. \u201cI eat Greggs, Greggs baguettes \u2013 that\u2019s what I eat when I\u2019m in London,\u201d he said in an interview with Magic FM. Whiteside said it was \u201cnever harmful\u201d to have a celebrity endorsement but that there had been no contact with the actor. \u201cThere is a long list of celebrities who have been caught [on camera] one way or another coming out of a Greggs. So Jake is the latest convert. More of him please and all of his social media friends,\u201d he said. The healthy eating segment of the business \u2013 such as the low-calorie sandwiches and porridge \u2013 is the fastest growing section of the company, said Whiteside, with sales of more than \u00a31m a week, albeit from a low base. Overall revenues amount to about \u00a315m per week. Sales of its sausage rolls, an item most closely associated with Greggs, are also increasing, he said. Three quarters of the company\u2019s stores now open by 7am to attract the breakfast market. The company aims to open 20 to 30 new stores this year and between 30 and 50 from next year, said Whiteside.",

      "bodyText": "The latest cost of living figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that across all household types, the rise in the cost of living remains desperately weak. While this by itself is good news, it underscores the complete lack of demand in the economy at the moment, which is in turn producing weak growth in household income. Cost of living is a rather interesting economic bit of data which rarely agrees with people\u2019s perceptions. For example, there is little doubt that electricity prices did fall when the carbon price was removed, and yet, as Lenore Taylor reports, 60% of people believe it had no impact on their electricity bills. Across Australia, when the carbon price was removed, electricity prices fell by about 8%. But in the past nine months prices have started to rise again \u2013 they\u2019re up 4.5%: So even while the ACCC may have calculated \u201cdirect cost savings, ranging from $153 to $269, that have been passed through to customers by electricity and natural gas retailers\u201d, people are not likely to perceive any great savings. Prices have risen in the past nine months and a big bill remains a big bill. That\u2019s why politicians will never belittle talk of cost of living rises. However, the reality right now is that cost of living is rising about as slowly as we have ever experienced. In the past 12 months employee households saw their cost of living rise by just 0.9%, the same for age pensioner households. For self-funded retiree households, the cost of living rose by 1.2%, and for households on non-age pension government benefits it rose by 1.1%: The reason for the differences in cost of living is because the ABS calculates different spending habits for households according to the main source of their income. While the CPI figures attempt to establish an average for all households, the cost of living figures recognise that, for example, employee households have different spending habits from that of age pensioners. Thus, the main reason self-funded retirees saw a bigger cost-of-living increase than employees was that, as they are more likely to have paid off their home, they get less benefit from a cut in interest rates. Similarly, as they spend more on transport than age-pensioner households they were hit more by increases in petrol prices. The big difference between inflation and cost of living figures is the treatment of housing. In the CPI the price of owner-occupied housing is counted (worth 8.7% of the total basket of goods and services included in the CPI figures) but it doesn\u2019t consider the cost of mortgage repayments. In the cost of living figures, house prices are excluded (because most people don\u2019t buy a house each year, and whether or not the value of your house goes up really doesn\u2019t affect your cost of living in a direct sense), but it does include interest charges \u2013 including mortgage repayments. Thus, during the period where the RBA was slashing rates, the cost of living for employee households (which are the most likely to have a mortgage to pay off) fell faster than other households despite house prices and rents also rising: And because housing price rises were a major contributor to the increase in the CPI, it\u2019s not surprising that for the first time since 2013, all households saw their cost of living rise by less than the official inflation figure: But while low cost of living rises is good, it doesn\u2019t immediately translate into good times because it only looks at one side of the ledger. Costs might be rising slowly, but what about income? As we know, wages have been rising by less than ever before: The balance of rising income and cost of living determines whether or not our living standards have risen or fallen. And in the past year our incomes have risen weakly, but because of the near-record low growth in the cost of living our overall standard of living has risen. But only just. The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (Natsem) earlier this week released its latest quarterly household budget report. It found that income growth in the past year was lower than average but was offset by lower cost of living increases (Natsem uses a different measure from the ABS, but they yield generally similar results). Thus, living standards in Australia did rise in the past 12 months, but by just 1.1% or \u201clittle more than half the long-term trend of around 2%\u201d. Standard of living increases are always welcome, but much like increases in cost of living, they often don\u2019t gel with people\u2019s intuition. Weak income growth but even weaker of cost of living, might lead to a technical increase in standard of living, but it is such a low level as to be barely noticeable unless you were paying very close attention. And that pretty much is the story of Australia\u2019s economy at the moment \u2013 yes, going by the data it is growing, but you\u2019d hardly know it when you look around in your day to day life.",
