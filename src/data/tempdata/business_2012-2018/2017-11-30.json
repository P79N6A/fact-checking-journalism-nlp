      "bodyText": "The great mystery of why the board of the London Stock Exchange wanted to drop Xavier Rolet as its chief executive is finally revealed. Sort of. He\u2019d had a long innings but \u201caspects of Xavier Rolet\u2019s operating style were also important factors\u201d, says the LSE\u2019s circular to shareholders. What does that mean? It means lawyers have been working overtime, which has been the case at the LSE since October, when Rolet\u2019s departure was agreed and announced as part of a \u201csuccession plan\u201d. The circular \u2013 the LSE\u2019s defence of its chairman, Donald Brydon \u2013 describes how a \u201cnegotiated document\u201d was drawn up to deflect media inquiries. Nobody was allowed to say that Rolet had, in fact, been told he had to go by the end of 2018. The LSE calls its approach to communications \u201ctypical\u201d but its constipated strategy invited trouble. It arrived when Sir Christopher Hohn, from the activist TCI hedge fund, stated that Rolet had been pushed out against his will and demanded his reinstatement. The farce continued, culminating in Rolet\u2019s immediate departure on Wednesday. Note this detail in the circular: in the final stages of the affair, relations between Rolet and \u201ccertain members of the senior management team\u201d deteriorated. Rolet and the non-executives brought this mess on themselves in roughly equal measure. Brydon should have known that, when a long-serving and successful boss leaves, you can\u2019t give shareholders the brush-off: you have to explain why. Rolet, having agreed to go and having secured a \u00a313m payoff, should have killed TCI\u2019s talk of a comeback at the outset. The show now rolls on to 19 December to consider TCI\u2019s other proposal that Brydon be sacked. It is safe to predict that the chairman will survive. Most fund managers, like the governor of the Bank of England, know that boards have a duty to change the chief executive if they spot warning signs. \u201cAspects of Xavier Rolet\u2019s operating style\u201d \u2013 with no elaboration \u2013 is a comically clumsy construction, but the board made a unanimous judgment that was backed by regulators. That\u2019s life \u2013 and any personal animosity between Rolet and Brydon is now beside the point. TCI is wasting its time. Justice served \u2013 better late than never The joint statement ran to only two sentences but the financial settlement between Lloyds and Paul and Nikki Turner is a significant moment in the great HBOS Reading debacle. Lloyds, which bought HBOS in 2009, is finally recognising the heroic efforts of two victims who helped to expose a huge fraud for which six people were imprisoned after a trial earlier this year. \u201cLloyds Banking Group is sorry for the significant personal distress the Turners have suffered and acknowledges their vital role, over more than a decade, campaigning tirelessly for justice for all the victims of the criminal conduct at HBOS Reading Impaired Assets Office,\u201d said the statement. The wording could have been better. It is not clear what, precisely, Lloyds is admitting it did wrong. That, presumably, is because allegations that the bank tried to cover up the fraud are still being investigated. But, just in case anybody has forgotten what the Turners went through, consider this detail: HBOS and Lloyds, between them, made 22 legal attempts to repossess the couple\u2019s house. The terms of the financial settlement were not disclosed but one hopes Lloyds was taken to the cleaners. Auditing the auditor Still on HBOS-related matters, the Financial Reporting Council, the audit regulator, also offered a mea culpa of sorts, even if its chief executive, Stephen Haddrill, preferred the ugly phrase \u201ca learning point\u201d. \u201cWe should have adopted a more proactive approach to our early inquiries in relation to HBOS,\u201d he said. You bet. HBOS, the second-biggest failing in British banking history, collapsed in October 2008, seven months after it had reported a profit of \u00a35.5bn. The position was crying out for a fast but thorough probe of KPMG\u2019s audit of the bank\u2019s 2007 accounts. The result of that inquiry, however, came only in September this year, when the council concluded there was no prospect of a finding of misconduct against KPMG. The process was disgracefully slow. In future, the council will also explain the reasons for its decisions, which it has finally now done in the KPMG case. Hurrah for progress \u2013 but it should not have taken persistent pressure by the Treasury select committee to get to this point.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s major oil producers have extended production cuts through to the end of 2018, in a bid to tackle a global glut of crude and keep prices buoyant. Members of Opec, the oil cartel, and other major producers including Russia agreed that the curbs, which started in January and have lifted a barrel of Brent crude from $40 to $50 last year to more than $60 now, will continue for a further nine-months. Khalid al-Falih, the Saudi energy minister, said the extension of the current cuts \u2013 which expire at the end of March 2018 \u2013 was necessary because \u201cmore work needed to be done\u201d. Following the deal at a meeting in Vienna which ministers hailed as historic and unprecedented, the price of Brent stood at $63.28 a barrel, up 0.27% on the day. Alexander Novak, the Russian energy minister, said: \u201cTo reach our goals, to rebalance the market, we must continue to act in a coordinated fashion, to act jointly, which would take us further in 2018 [with cuts].\u201d Despite suggestions ahead of the meeting that the Saudis and Russians were at odds over the extension, Falih said of his Russian counterpart: \u201cYou cannot find light between us. We have been united shoulder to shoulder ... We are completely aligned.\u201d As the biggest producer in Opec and the country bearing the brunt of the cuts of 1.8m barrels a day, Saudi Arabia is the key player at the talks. The kingdom needs a strong oil price to support the planned $2tn listing of its national oil company in the second half of 2018, which would be the world\u2019s biggest stock market flotation. Russia, by contrast, was seen as wary of ceding too much market share to rivals and helping US crude producers with a higher oil price. In what is seen as a sop to Moscow, the extension will be reviewed in June to assess whether the glut of oil on world markets is on track to come back down to a five-year average. Falih said a decision in May by Opec and its allies to extend the curbs to March 2018 had already driven global oil supply and demand much closer into balance. \u201cMarket stability has improved and the sentiment is generally upbeat. The rebalancing trend has accelerated and inventories are on a generally declining trend,\u201d he said. Falih said the action taken by the cartel, which along with geopolitical uncertainty has pushed the oil prices to two-year highs, had demonstrated the club\u2019s power. \u201cOpec\u2019s credibility has also been enhanced, although a couple of members have lagged behind and we hope they will pick up their conformity [to the targets] in months to come,\u201d Falih said, in an apparent reference to Iraq and the UAE. Falih said the cartel was aware of the risk of a resurgent US shale oil industry, and the group would be \u201cagile\u201d in responding. However, he downplayed shale\u2019s impact, saying US oil production this year had been moderate. \u201cThere was a lot of fear mongering about shale in 2017,\u201d he said. The number of US oil rigs has leapt by more than a third since a year ago, when Opec and Russia first agreed to curtail production. Oil analysts Wood Mackenzie said stakes had been high for Opec and Russia, but Thursday\u2019s decision meant global oil supply and demand would come closer into balance in the second half of 2018, and prices would go higher at the same time. Olivier Jakob, analyst at Petromatrix, said that while the outcome was largely as expected, the meeting showed that countries were beginning to look at an exit strategy from the production cuts. \u201cI think the June review is really part of the exit strategy that the Russians desire,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is some good cooperation [in Vienna], but there is increasing talk about the exit strategy.\u201d The Bank of England is expecting recent higher oil prices to drive inflation up from its current level of 3%. The cost of oil accounts for a third of the price of fuel that motorists buy, so any further rises spurred by the Opec deal are likely to quickly feed through to UK households already hit by the rising cost of living. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The London Stock Exchange has been forced to set out the rationale for the departure of chief executive, Xavier Rolet, citing his \u201coperating style\u201d and questions from shareholders about how long he intended to stay. The exchange provided the explanation in a 20-page circular setting the date for the shareholders\u2019 meeting demanded by an activist investor which wants to oust the company\u2019s chairmanover his handling of Rolet\u2019s departure. In one of the highest-profile boardroom battles in recent years, Sir Chris Hohn\u2019s TCI fund management group has demanded the shareholder vote \u2013 which will take place on 19 December \u2013 to remove Donald Brydon, the City veteran who has chaired the exchange since 2015. TCI, the Children\u2019s Investment Fund Management, had been fighting against Rolet\u2019s departure but on Thursday dropped this following the LSE\u2019s announcement that the chief executive would leave immediately \u2013 a year earlier than planned. The LSE circular urges shareholders to support Brydon and says the non-executive directors unanimously agreed in October that an \u201camicable and smooth\u201d succession plan for Rolet be put in place. It said shareholders had been asking how long Rolet intended to stay \u2013 he would been chief executive for 10 years by the end of 2018 \u2013 after he offered to step aside if the merger of the LSE with its German rival, Deutsche B\u00f6rse, had taken place. That alliance was blocked by the European commission in March. The exchange added that \u201caspects of Xavier Rolet\u2019s operating style were also important factors\u201d considered by the board when putting in place a succession plan. It did not elaborate. TCI had originally called for Rolet to stay until 2021 although the circular reveals that there was uncertainty about whether he was willing to, which had \u201cnegatively impacted\u201d the relationship between him and the board. The LSE had been urging TCI to rethink its call for a shareholder meeting after bringing forward Rolet\u2019s departure date and announcing that Brydon would not stand for re-election at the 2019 AGM. The row prompted the intervention of Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, whose remarks appear to have accelerated Rolet\u2019s departure. Rolet could not be reached for comment.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of Goldman Sachs became the latest high-profile critic of bitcoin, claiming it was a vehicle to commit fraud as the value of the cryptocurrency plunged 20% in less than 24 hours. Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of the US investment bank, said: \u201cSomething that moves 20% [overnight] does not feel like a currency. It is a vehicle to perpetrate fraud.\u201d His comments came during another wildly volatile trading session for the digital currency, which plunged by over $2,000 in a 24-hour period. Having topped $11,000 to reach a new record high of $11,395 on Wednesday, it fell to a low of $9,000 on Thursday, before picking up slightly later in the day. Blankfein said Goldman did not need to have a bitcoin strategy, adding the digital currency would need to be a lot less volatile and a lot more liquid to justify closer attention. \u201cWhen do I have to have a bitcoin strategy? Not today. Life must be really rosy if that is what we are talking about,\u201d he said. \u201cBitcoin is not for me. A lot of things that have not been for me in the past 20 years have worked out, but I am not guessing that this will work out.\u201d Blankfein is the latest boss of a major bank to voice scepticism about bitcoin, after JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, described it as fraud that would ultimately blow up and said it was only fit for use by drug dealers, murderers and people living in places such as North Korea. On Wednesday, Sir Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, said the digital currency was too small to pose a systemic threat to the global economy. He also cautioned that bitcoin investors needed \u201cto do their homework\u201d. Despite the fall in bitcoin\u2019s value on Thursday, it remained far higher than it was at the start of 2017, when it was trading at $998. It is the biggest gainer of all asset classes this year, prompting sceptics to declare it a classic speculative bubble that could burst. Banks and other financial institutions remain concerned about bitcoin\u2019s early associations with money laundering and online crime. Unlike traditional currencies, bitcoin is not issued or regulated by a central bank or government. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at online trading company Interactive Investor, said the volatility in bitcoin trading was \u201cwild west stuff\u201d. \u201cCryptocurrency land\u2019s extreme volatility is like catnip to high-risk traders, and even traditional investors are dipping their toe. Given there\u2019s no logical way to value them with any accuracy, this remains wild west stuff.\u201d Analysts at the spread betting firm, City Index, said: \u201cWhile traditional assets are experiencing historically low levels of volatility, the whipsaw action of the bitcoin is drawing the attention of traditional traders. Meanwhile existing traders and newcomers are increasingly interested in fear of missing out.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Breaking news: Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih has confirmed that the agreement on curbing output will be extended. He said, the decision has been unanimous, a solid decision to extend deal through December 2018. It is basically a one year agreement, he said, tweaking the language to strengthen agreement. He said inventories were expected to decline to the desired targets in the second half of 2018. We don\u2019t expect supply surprises in 2018 as we saw in 2017, he says. But supply from other regions remains unknown, he says, especially shale producers from the US. We will be agile and respond as events unfold. The issue of Libya and Nigeria surprised market in 2017. There was constructive consultation with their leaders, they have an interest in market stability. We wish them the best. Both countries have told us their 2018 levels will not exceed what they achieved in 2017. So to the market we say there are no surprises expected from them. The six observing countries have also endorsed the agreement. We are very conscious the state of the global economy is impacted by volatility in oil prices. I feel extremely optimistic about short and long term outlook for oil. If I have a concern, it is that investment should flow back into the industry sooner rather than later. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Brent crude is currently up 0.4% at $63.37 a barrel, as Opec and non-Opec producers (Russia being the key member of the latter) agreed to extend their output curbs until the end of 2018. But West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has slipped 0.5% to $57 a barrel. Reuters is also reporting that a delegate has said that Opec and non-Opec members have agreed the extension at the afternoon meeting. Contrasting fortunes for US and European markets. Hopes that the Republican tax plan will be passed, along with a rebound in technology shares, has helped lift Wall Street to new peaks. But European shares slipped back as the euro held up, and the FTSE 100 similarly fell back on sterling strength against the dollar. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 0.9% or 66.89 at 7326.67 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.29% to 13,023.98 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.47% at 5372.79 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.55% at 10,211.0 But Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edged up 0.19% 22,368.29 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.26% to 740.20 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 208 points or 0.88%. Meanwhile bitcoin, having hit 11,395 late on Wednesday, is now down 5.75% at 9259. Now there will be a group photo and then the meeting will continue in private. The positive trend in the market is driven by good fundamental metrics, says Novak. We are continuing to see inventory draws, a significant decline in volatily and investment returning. We are also seeing....good demand growth. However, to reach our goals, to rebalance the market, we must continue to act jointly and take us further into 2018 and have a co-ordinated approach to that. Both consumers and producers are waiting to see what we will announce today. I am hopeful we will arrive at a joint conclusion. The key player among the non-Opec countries is of course Russia. Its energy minister Alexander Novak says the joint efforts are benefiting the whole global economy. We deliberated on the extension of the agreement at the Opec meeting this morning, and this will now be deliberated with our non-Opec colleagues, he says. We must continue to work in unison and stay the course. (Opec members have reportedly agreed to extend the output curbs from March 2018 to the end of the year, but this needs now to be agreed by non-Opec participants.) Demand is on firm ground, he says, and there has been 100% compliance to the target by Opec and non-Opec members. We are heading in the right direction but we are not where we want to be, we must remain focused, he says. The meeting\u2019s chair, Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih is making his opening statements, saying the declaration a year ago was a landmark achievement and has helped the oil industry recover. He says many thought it would might not affect market conditions, but the effects are self evident. The Opec and non-Opec meeting is about to start shortly and can be seen live here. The press conference will apparently follow afterwards. The pound has continued its gains against the dollar and is now up 0.8% at $1.3515. This is the first time sterling has been higher than $1.35 since the end of September. The currency is benefitting from growing hopes that some key Brexit agreements will be made, but there are also some US developments which are denting the dollar. Connor Campbell, market analyst at Spreadex, says: The dollar lost a step this afternoon as news broke that Donald Trump is looking to get rid of Rex Tillerson as State Secretary and replace him with CIA chief Mike Pompeo. In the aftermath of the reports cable saw its gains widen to 0.8%, lifting the pound above $1.35 for the first time since the end of September, while the euro rose half a percent and the yen erased its early losses. All this is presumably because investors aren\u2019t too happy to see further signs of discord in the Trump government just as progress is being made on the tax bill. The Dow Jones, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t too fussed by the news, rising half a percent after the bell to a brand spanking new all-time high of 24070. That marks around a 500 point surge since the start of Tuesday\u2019s trading, and a 21% climb since the year began. Meanwhile on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed above 24,000 for the first time. A rebound in technology stocks and continuing hopes of progress with the Republican tax cut plan have combined to send US markets higher. The Dow is currently up 132 points at 24,073 while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.36% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.4%. The pound has just hit a new nine-week high against the US dollar, at $1.3494. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says optimism over Brexit is helping sterling: The pound is continuing to dine out on the signs of Brexit progress, with yesterday\u2019s reports of a divorce bill agreement joined by a rumours that the UK and EU are \u2018close to a breakthrough\u2019 on the Irish border issue. Over at Opec\u2019s luxury hotel, energy reporters are tucking into a range of delicious nibbles: That platter does have a certain 1970s feel about it. Perhaps Opec is harking back to its glory days, when it could impose an oil embargo on America and send gasoline prices soaring. Guardian Business has launched a daily email.

Some photos from the Opec meeting have landed: Cailin Birch, Commodities Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, warns that oil producers are losing their enthusiasm for output cuts. She says: \u201cPolitical will to maintain the quota system is beginning to wane among some OPEC countries and some non-OPEC partners, including Russia. Global oil prices have held over US$60/b for over a month now, a level that was unimaginable earlier this year. Global oil stocks are beginning to decline, closer to the five-year average range. As a result, some key producers appear to be interested in ending the production-cut deal sooner rather than later, in an effort to preserve market share. But despite those concerns, she still expects a deal today: The EIU considers it to be more likely that the cuts will be extended through to end-2018, with an option to review this agreement at mid-year -- a nod to some partners less willing to stay on board. Although the global market is beginning to tighten, oil supplies remain comfortable and US output continues to rise; this means that continued restraint by OPEC will be necessary to erode global stockpiles further. Bloomberg are reporting that a deal to extend Opec\u2019s production cuts by nine months is in the bag. Ministers are now discussing how to review the situation next June. The oil price is rallying, following this morning\u2019s loud hints from Opec that production cuts will be extended at today\u2019s meeting in Vienna. Brent crude has jumped by a whole dollar per barrel, or 1.6%, to $64.11. Traders are anticipating that the oil cartel will extend its current output curbs for an extra nine months, to the end of 2018 -- following the Opec call for everyone to stick together. But the oil market can be a volatile beast (although rarely in the bitcoin league!). So if Opec disappoints, we could see prices fall sharply. Craig Erlam of trading firm Oanda reckons a nine-month extension is largely priced in: Only a more aggressive cut is likely to provide any substantial upside, although I\u2019m not sure there\u2019ll be much appetite for such action given the progress that\u2019s already been made and the market share that is being conceded to US shale as a result. Financial traders are fascinated by Bitcoin\u2019s wild gyrations, says City Index. Given the current price action of the cryptocurrency, headlines are easy to come by, and yesterday was no different. The virtual currency gained over 15% in the early part of the day, charging through $10,000 to a fresh all time high of over $11,000, before plummeting as much as 21%, with incredible speed to $9009. Whilst traditional assets are experiencing historically low levels of volatility, the whipsaw action of the bitcoin is drawing the attention of traditional traders. Meanwhile existing traders and new comers are increasingly interested in fear of missing out. Bubble or no bubble, there is nothing to say the price can\u2019t go up further. With more interest from professionals, from the mainstream, and Nasdaq also announcing plans to launch bitcoin futures, the virtual currency\u2019s legitimacy has grown exponentially which is reflected in its price increase. Bitcoin has rallied over 1100% since the start of the year and 100% in the last two weeks. But with these size of price increases, a hefty downside should also be expected. Bitcoin is falling out of bed again. The cryptocurrency has now tumbled $9,500, a loss of $1,000 compared to this morning\u2019s height. It looks like a repeat of yesterday\u2019s selloff, when the cryptocurrency plummeted shortly after crashing through the $11,000 milestone. Even so, Bitcoin\u2019s gains this year are extraordinary; it\u2019s quadrupled since the summer. But still, these wild fluctuations do suggest that bitcoin has bubbly tendancies. Speaking of bubbly... apparently you can buy a second-hand gold Rolls-Royce (complete with a rear refrigerator and champagne flutes) using bitcoin: Robert Chote, who runs the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, says there are several reasons why migration into the UK has slowed, including the slump in the pound. But... the push factors have also weakened. Economist Douglas McWilliams points out that Europe\u2019s economy has been creating more jobs recently, giving people less reason to look abroad. Stephen Clarke of Resolution Foundation says the drop in potential workers will hurt some UK companies: But Home Office minister Brandon Lewis argues that the system is working: Migration into the UK from Europe has slowed sharply since the Brexit vote last year, as fewer people come to Britain looking for a job. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show that net migration into the UK fell to 230,000 in the year ending June 2017. That\u2019s the largest annual decrease ever recorded, down from +336,000 in the previous 12 months (running up to the EU vote). Over three-quarters of the decrease in net migration can be accounted for by EU citizens. The number moving to the UK fell by 82,000 to +107,000, which the ONS calls \u201ca statistically significant decrease\u201d. Those immigrating with a \u201cdefinite job\u201d remained stable (187,000); while the number of people coming to the UK \u201clooking for work\u201d fell by 56,000 to 74,000. Again, much of the decline (47,000) was due to EU citizens. Reaction to follow.... Newsflash: Unemployment in the eurozone has hit its lowest level in almost nine years. The euro area jobless rate has dropped to 8.8%, the best reading since January 2009, as the region\u2019s recovery continues. Germany still has one of the best unemployment rates, while France, Italy and Spain are all lagging. Al-Falih also touches (briefly) on environmental issues. He says Opec should give climate change \u201cdue attention\u201d and \u201ccontinually engage on environmental issues\u201d (while still pumping millions of barrels of oil out of the ground each day to be burned or turned into plastic, presumably). The press pack have now been shooed away from the oil ministers, and the Opec meeting is formally under way. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Khalid Al-Falih is chairing the meeting, as he\u2019s Opec\u2019s president. He says that Opec has \u201ccome a long way\u201d in the last year towards rebalancing the oil market, but \u201ca lot more needs to be done\u201d. Al-Falih cautions that the energy market is entering the \u201clow-demand\u201d period. But, the medium to long-term outlook looks healthy as the global economy strengthens. Al-Falih urges members to stick together, rather than bowing to the temptation to pump more oil than is permitted under the output cuts deal. History says that as you get closer to the goal, commitment wavers. I call on you all to stay the course, rather than relying on others. In the long term, Al-Falih says that oil producers must invest in new infrastructure to ensure oil production in the future. Ot oh..Bitcoin is losing some of its earlier gains, and is now back at $10,075. That\u2019s a gain of 2.5% so far today. A scrum of TV cameras have swarmed around Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister. Khalid Al-Falih says that he believes Opec should continue its current policy of curbing oil output, to get the market back into balance. We should \u201ccontinue the process that has worked so well in 2017\u201d, Al-Falih declares. He adds: We are not complacent. We are going into 2018 half done. We need all of 2018 to get the job done. Al-Falih also says it is \u201cpremature\u201d to talk about Opec exiting its production cuts. But he does suggests that the cartel could reassess the situation next summer: Iran\u2019s oil minister says that $60 per barrel is a \u2018good price\u2019 - a sign that the Iranian government is happy with the production cuts deal. Across the room, Kuwaiti\u2019s oil minister has told reporters that he supports a nine-month extension to the cuts deal. NEWSFLASH: Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil minister has dropped a strong hint that Opec will agree to extend production cuts by nine months today. Khalid A. Al-Falih has told reporters in Vienna that the existing deal is working well, and there is \u201cperfect alignment\u201d between Opec members. Al-Falih adds oil producers shouldn\u2019t ease off until the market is healthier. He personally favours a nine-month extension - and hopes that other members will back this idea too. The Financial Times\u2019s Anjli Raval has the details: The Opec meeting is open, and journalists are racing into the room to quiz energy ministers.... Newsflash: Iraqi officials have said they support extending Opec\u2019s output curbs deal until the end of next year. Russia isn\u2019t an Opec member, but it can still play a key role at today\u2019s meeting. A year ago, Russia threw its weight behind the oil output curbs drawn up by Opex. That deal took 1.8 million barrels per day out of the market, helping to push crude prices up this year. For today\u2019s deal to be a success, Opec needs Russia to stay on board. Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, says Moscow has reservations over the deal - but will probably back an extension today. Kapadia says: Russian Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin recently indicated that their economic growth in October was negatively affected by their deal with OPEC. The Economy Minister\u2019s comments are the first by a senior Russian official giving a negative assessment on the deal where Russia agreed to cut output by 300,000 bpd compared with its level in October 2016. These comments are understandable given Russia\u2019s heavy oil dependence. However, they should arguably be willing to take some short-term pain to gain the benefit of medium term price gains. The country lost out heavily during the oil price collapse in 2008-09 and mid-2014. We expect the country to accept and cooperate over the cutback extension at the OPEC meeting in Vienna The Opec meeting is being streamed live, here. The reporters covering Opec are keeping warm by huddling together in a stairwell, waiting to be allowed into the meeting. Brent crude has risen by 0.5% this morning, to $63.45 per barrel. Several delegates are hinting that Opec will indeed extend its output curbs by another nine months today. Hopefully the Opec delegates remembered their hats and gloves. The chatter in Vienna is that Opec will agree to cut oil output for an extra nine months. The current production deal expires in March - but ministers are now considering extending it until the end of 2018. If so, that could nudge the oil prices higher (with the caveat that other producers can simply pump more) Reuters explains: While there has not been an official statement, OPEC and Russia seem ready to prolong their oil supply cuts until the end of 2018. The cuts were put in place last January and are set to expire next March. However, an extension may include a review in June should healthy demand amid ongoing supply restraint overheat the market. \u201cOPEC loves leaving an ace card up their sleeve, they will never give everything away (in advance),\u201d said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Investor Services in Dubai. ANZ bank said \u201canything less than a nine-month extension to the current production agreement could see the recent sell-off accelerate.\u201d Sterling has hit a new nine-week high this morning, driven by hopes that the UK and Europe will hammer out a Brexit deal. The pound is trading at $1.34, the highest since 26 September. Investors are hopeful that the two sides will reach agreement on Britain\u2019s \u2018exit bill\u2019 next month, and move onto trade talks. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, says sterling is getting a Brexit boost: Optimism that our Brexit negotiators can do a deal at December\u2019s summit and move onto crucial post-Brexit trade talks, is greater now than it has been. Wild also advises bitcoin traders to tread cautiously, after this week\u2019s volatility. Believe in it or not, bitcoin is worth over $10,000 again. Cryptocurrency land\u2019s extreme volatility is like catnip to high-risk traders, and even traditional investors are dipping their toe. Given there\u2019s no logical way to value them with any accuracy, this remains Wild West stuff. Bitcoin\u2019s wild swings have left some experienced City figures a little baffled. Martin Gilbert, co-CEO of Standard Life Aberdeen, was on Bloomberg TV this morning, and asked if he\u2019s been buying crypto-currencies. Gilbert denied it, saying: I wouldn\u2019t even know how to buy it. Even by bitcoin\u2019s usual standards, this is turning into quite a dizzying week. Last night, the crypto currency plunged by 20% (!) after hitting a fresh record high over $11,300 yesterday. Bitcoin is still looking skittish this morning, surging back up to $10,618 before subsiding. All terribly exciting, but not perhaps what you\u2019re looking for in a currency. As an asset class, you need strong nerves to trade it. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a big day for the energy market. Over in a chilly Vienna, oil ministers from the Opec group of energy producers are gathering for a crucial meeting. Opec must decide whether to extend their existing production cuts agreement, and for how long, in an attempt to remove excess capacity and support oil prices. The existing deal, agreed a year ago, seems to have succeeded. Brent crude has risen from $56 per barrel to around $63 in the last 12 months. But with competitors such as shale and renewables lurking, Opec will probably decide to extend the production curbs. But for how long? Six months? A year? Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the meeting could move the markets. Today\u2019s main event is expected to be the OPEC meeting in Vienna where it is expected that oil ministers will extend the output freeze by another 9 months, until the end of 2018. That is certainly what a ministerial committee of oil producers recommended yesterday, however that didn\u2019t stop oil prices continuing their recent slide lower ahead of today\u2019s announcement. There appear to be some concerns that Russia might well throw a ratchet into the gears, particularly in the context of the length of the output extension. There has been some concern that an extended freeze could well leave the field open to US shale producers who are already pumping at record levels. Therefore the biggest question isn\u2019t around an extension, it\u2019s about how long the extension lasts for. We should know later today. European stock markets are expected to be calm, as traders await developments in Vienna. We\u2019ll also be watching bitcoin, after it surged through $11,000 yesterday only to fall back sharply. Plus, we get new eurozone inflation and unemployment data this morning. Here\u2019s the agenda: 9am GMT: Opening session at the Opec meeting in Vienna 10am GMT: Eurozone inflation data for October 10am GMT: Eurozone unemployment data for October 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless figures 4pm GMT (approx): Opec decision",

He said, the decision has been unanimous, a solid decision to extend deal through December 2018. It is basically a one year agreement, he said, tweaking the language to strengthen agreement.</p> <p>He said inventories were expected to decline to the desired targets in the second half of 2018.</p> <p>We don\u2019t expect supply surprises in 2018 as we saw in 2017, he says. But supply from other regions remains unknown, he says, especially shale producers from the US. We will be agile and respond as events unfold.</p> <p>The issue of Libya and Nigeria surprised market in 2017. There was constructive consultation with their leaders, they have an interest in market stability. We wish them the best. Both countries have told us their 2018 levels will not exceed what they achieved in 2017.

But for how long? Six months? A year?</p> <p><strong>Michael Hewson</strong> of <strong>CMC Markets</strong> says the meeting could move the markets.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s main event is expected to be the OPEC meeting in Vienna where it is expected that oil ministers will extend the output freeze by another 9 months, until the end of 2018. That is certainly what a ministerial committee of oil producers recommended yesterday, however that didn\u2019t stop oil prices continuing their recent slide lower ahead of today\u2019s announcement. </p> <p>There appear to be some concerns that Russia might well throw a ratchet into the gears, particularly in the context of the length of the output extension. There has been some concern that an extended freeze could well leave the field open to US shale producers who are already pumping at record levels. Therefore the biggest question isn\u2019t around an extension, it\u2019s about how long the extension lasts for. We should know later today.</p> </blockquote> <p>European stock markets are expected to be calm, as traders await developments in Vienna.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IpekOzkardeskay/status/936132752868458496\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">European markets opening call <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LCGTrading?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@LCGTrading</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTSE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$FTSE</a> -13 points at 7380<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DAX&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$DAX</a> +12 points at 13073<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CAC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$CAC</a> +9 points at 5407<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBEX&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$IBEX</a> +3 points at 10270</p>&mdash; Ipek Ozkardeskaya (@IpekOzkardeskay) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IpekOzkardeskay/status/936132752868458496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 30, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>We\u2019ll also be watching bitcoin, after it surged through $11,000 yesterday only to fall back sharply.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/29/bitcoin-world-economy-bank-of-england-jon-cunliffe-price\">Bitcoin price soars above $11,000 as central bankers seek to calm fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Plus, we get new eurozone inflation and unemployment data this morning.</p> <h2>Here\u2019s the agenda:</h2> <ul> <li>9am GMT: Opening session at the Opec meeting in Vienna<br></li> <li>10am GMT: Eurozone inflation data for October<br></li> <li>10am GMT: Eurozone unemployment data for October<br></li> <li>1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless figures<br></li> <li>4pm GMT (approx): Opec decision<br></li> </ul> </div>   </div>",

Ofwat criticised the utility alongside three other companies for \u201cshortcomings in the data handling\u201d that mean customers and the watchdog \u201ccannot be sure the information presented is complete and accurate\u201d. Aileen Armstrong, Ofwat\u2019s senior director of finance and governance, said: \u201cAs customers, we want to be able to trust what we get from our water company, be that the water out of the tap or what they tell us. Unfortunately, on the second of those, our checks suggest we might not be able to take everything at face value.\u201d The other water companies criticised by Ofwat were Bristol Water, Dee Valley Water and Southern Water. Ofwat\u2019s report comes days after Thames Water admitted letting down customers by failing to meet its leakage targets and said it would halve planned price increases next year. This means the average annual bill will be about \u00a38 less than it would otherwise have been for 5 million households. Ofwat said there were \u201cserious concerns\u201d over Thames Water when it came to two categories: following the regulator\u2019s financial monitoring framework and a broad assessment of \u201coutcomes\u201d \u2013 meant to measure whether consumers, politicians and regulators can understand what companies are doing to meet customer expectations. \u201cWe concluded that the significance of our concerns in two assessments meant that the company did not instil sufficient confidence about its ability to deliver, monitor and report performance,\u201d it said. Thames Water said it was disappointed by the regulator\u2019s decision to classify the company in its lowest assessment category, arguing that it had made \u201cextensive efforts \u2026 to be open and transparent about the performance of our business\u201d. \u201cWe will be working hard to rebuild trust and achieve self-assured status as quickly as possible,\u201d the company said. Ofwat recommended that Thames Water develop better assurance plans, which are designed to give customers confidence in the accuracy of company data. It expects Thames Water to release the results ahead of a consultation by the end of January, and publish an action plan online by the end of March. Armstrong said: \u201cThese businesses provide essential public services and they need to assure customers they are doing the right things in the right way. If they are to gain and keep the trust of customers, they need to have high-quality checks on their information and present it fairly, clearly and completely.\u201d Thames Water has faced a series of negative headlines this year. In March, it was fined a record \u00a320m for allowing 1.4bn litres of raw sewage into the Thames between 2012 to 2014. The company has also come under pressure over excessive executive pay. The group is bringing in Ian Marchant, the former chief executive of the big six energy company SSE, as chairman to clean up its corporate governance failings. He will replace the long-serving Sir Peter Mason in January. The company also announced that it would close its Cayman Islands subsidiaries. Thames Water, which has not paid corporation tax in the UK for the past 10 years, said there was no tax advantage from the two Cayman subsidiaries, but management is understood to accept \u201cit just looks wrong\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A couple who spent 10 years investigating a multimillion-pound fraud at HBOS have settled their claim for compensation with Lloyds Banking Group, which took over the bank at the height of the financial crisis. Lloyds apologised for the \u201csignificant personal distress\u201d faced by Paul and Nikki Turner, the small business owners who raised the alarm about the fraud inside the Reading branch of HBOS, for which six people were jailed earlier this year. Among them were the former HBOS senior manager Lynden Scourfield, who pleaded guilty to the fraud that involved introducing his small business clients to David Mills, whose consultancy Quayside Corporate Services (QCS) profited from high consultancy fees. Sentencing Scourfield, the judge, Martin Beddoe, told him he sold his \u201csoul for sex, for luxury trips with and without your wife, for bling and for swag\u201d. He was described by the judge as an \u201cutterly corrupt bank manager\u201d. The Turners have previously said they took a \u00a3160,000 loan for their publishing company Zenith from HBOS Reading in 2003, and were introduced to QCS the following year when Scourfield started managing their account. They were required to pay fees, which they said eventually amounted to thousands of pounds, to QCS on a monthly basis. In a joint statement announcing the undisclosed settlement, the bank acknowledged the \u201cvital role over more than a decade\u201d played by the pair and their efforts in \u201ccampaigning tirelessly for justice for all the victims of the criminal conduct at HBOS Reading\u201d. The statement said the bank and the Turners were \u201cpleased that the dispute between them has been fully resolved and a settlement has been reached\u201d. Nikki and Paul Turner said they were \u201crelieved and delighted\u201d they had agreed a settlement with the bank. \u201cLloyds has recognised not only our role in campaigning for the victims of the HBOS Reading scandal, but also that we will be continuing our work on behalf of other victims in order to help them secure a similar element of closure,\u201d they said. The fraudulent activities at HBOS Reading took place between 2003 and 2007 and Lloyds has set aside \u00a3100m to compensate businesses affected. The claims are being assessed by Prof Russel Griggs, but about a dozen of the 63 business that are part of his review are yet to provide him with information about their cases. Lloyds has offered \u00a329m to 42 businesses, about 80% of which have accepted their deals. The Turners\u2019 company, along with two other businesses including one owned by Noel Edmonds, are not part of the formal review. The bank had originally pledged to make offers by the end of June to all the businesses affected. The events at HBOS have also been a focus for the audit profession. On Thursday, the industry regulator admitted it should been faster to look at the audit of the bank\u2019s 2007 accounts. These were signed off by accountants KPMG just months before the bank was taken over by Lloyds and the enlarged company bailed out by the taxpayer. \u201cWe should have adopted a more proactive approach to our early enquiries in relation to HBOS rather than a heavy reliance on other regulators,\u201d said Stephen Haddrill, head of the Financial Reporting Council, in a letter to Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee. The council announced in September that it had closed its investigation into KPMG after finding that the audit \u201cdid not fall significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 December 2017. An earlier version quoted remarks from the judge when sentencing Lynden Scourfield as being about David Mills.",

      "body": "<p>A couple who spent 10 years investigating a multimillion-pound fraud at HBOS have settled their claim for compensation with Lloyds Banking Group, which took over the bank at the height of the financial crisis.</p> <p>Lloyds apologised for the \u201csignificant personal distress\u201d faced by Paul and Nikki Turner, the small business owners who raised the alarm about the fraud inside the Reading branch of HBOS, for which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/07/lloyds-hbos-loan-scam-lynden-scourfield-compensation\">six people were jailed</a> earlier this year.</p> <p>Among them were the former HBOS senior manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/30/cash-cruises-sex-parties-hbos-manager-lynden-scourfield\">Lynden Scourfield</a>, who pleaded guilty to the fraud that involved introducing his small business clients to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/30/financiers-ex-hbos-manager-scam\">David Mills</a>, whose consultancy Quayside Corporate Services (QCS) profited from high consultancy fees.</p> <p>Sentencing Scourfield, the judge, Martin Beddoe, told him he sold his \u201csoul for sex, for luxury trips with and without your wife, for bling and for swag\u201d. He was described by the judge as an \u201cutterly corrupt bank manager\u201d.</p> <p>The Turners have previously said they took a \u00a3160,000 loan for their publishing company Zenith from HBOS Reading in 2003, and were introduced to QCS the following year when Scourfield started managing their account. They were required to pay fees, which they said eventually amounted to thousands of pounds, to QCS on a monthly basis.</p> <p>In a joint statement announcing the undisclosed settlement, the bank acknowledged the \u201cvital role over more than a decade\u201d played by the pair and their efforts in \u201ccampaigning tirelessly for justice for all the victims of the criminal conduct at HBOS Reading\u201d. </p> <p>The statement said the bank and the Turners were \u201cpleased that the dispute between them has been fully resolved and a settlement has been reached\u201d.</p> <p>Nikki and Paul Turner said they were \u201crelieved and delighted\u201d they had agreed a settlement with the bank.</p> <p>\u201cLloyds has recognised not only our role in campaigning for the victims of the HBOS Reading scandal, but also that we will be continuing our work on behalf of other victims in order to help them secure a similar element of closure,\u201d they said.</p> <p>The fraudulent activities at HBOS Reading took place between 2003 and 2007 and Lloyds has set aside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/07/lloyds-compensation-payouts-hbos-loans-scam\">\u00a3100m to compensate businesses</a> affected. The claims are being assessed by Prof Russel Griggs, but about a dozen of the 63 business that are part of his review are yet to provide him with information about their cases.</p> <p>Lloyds has offered \u00a329m to 42 businesses, about 80% of which have accepted their deals. The Turners\u2019 company, along with two other businesses including one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/26/hbos-fraud-lloyds-noel-edmonds-compensation\">owned by Noel Edmonds</a>, are not part of the formal review.</p> <p>The bank had originally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/18/lloyds-likley-to-extend-deadline-for-hbos-compensation-offers-noel-edmonds\">pledged to make offers</a> by the end of June to all the businesses affected.</p> <p>The events at HBOS have also been a focus for the audit profession. On Thursday, the industry regulator admitted it should been faster to look at the audit of the bank\u2019s 2007 accounts. These were signed off by accountants KPMG just months before the bank was taken over by Lloyds and the enlarged company bailed out by the taxpayer.</p> <p>\u201cWe should have adopted a more proactive approach to our early enquiries in relation to HBOS rather than a heavy reliance on other regulators,\u201d said Stephen Haddrill, head of the Financial Reporting Council, in a letter to Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee.</p> <p>The council announced in September that it had closed its investigation into KPMG after finding that the audit \u201cdid not fall significantly short of the standards reasonably to be expected\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 December 2017. An earlier version quoted remarks from the judge when sentencing Lynden Scourfield as being about David Mills.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The head of UberEats in Europe has become the latest senior executive to leave the company, as the ride-hailing arm of the business faces further pressure over its working practices in the UK. Jambu Palaniappan quit to join a European venture capital company in London, said Uber, which recently lost its licence to operate in the capital. The news came on Thursday as Uber faced questions from the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee over the hours worked by its cab drivers. The committee has demanded more information after the company failed to disclose how many drivers were working more than 70-80 hours a week. Rachel Reeves, the committee chair, said: \u201cPassengers booking journeys through Uber will want to know they are safe and secure. Uber needs to provide reassurance on these issues by setting out when it will introduce driver hour limits for its workforce and spell out what these limits will be. \u201cDrivers working long hours risk compromising the safety of both themselves and their passengers. It is strange that a data-driven business like Uber appears unable to answer our question on how many of its drivers are working more than 70 and 80 hours a week. We expect them to now respond with the missing figures.\u201d Uber said: \u201cDrivers spend an average of 30 hours a week logged into our app. However, this is not the same as the number of hours spent driving since drivers can log in while on a break or doing other things. We take the issue of tired driving seriously, which is why we regularly remind drivers to take rest breaks and will shortly be introducing hours limits in our app.\u201d Uber\u2019s head of public policy, Andrew Byrne, and one of the company\u2019s drivers were questioned by the committee last month. On Wednesday, it emerged that 2.7 million people in the UK were affected by a 2016 security breach that compromised customers\u2019 data, including names, email addresses and mobile phone numbers. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is investigating the breach and could fine Uber. Palaniappan joined Uber five years ago and became head of UberEats for Europe, Middle East and Africa in August 2016, as the company was rolling out the food delivery service in the UK, going head to head with Deliveroo. He will depart at the end of January. In a memo circulated to UberEats staff on Thursday morning, Palaniappan said leaving Uber was an \u201cextremely difficult decision\u201d. \u201cWhen I joined this company in 2012, Uber was just a small startup with 75 employees focused primarily on the US,\u201d he said. Uber \u200eis appealing against Transport for London\u2019s decision in September to withdraw its private-hire licence, when the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, accused the company of failing to \u201cplay by the rules\u201d. It has recruited the former Bank of England adviser Laurel Powers-Freeling as chair of UK operations. Uber says it has 5m customers in the UK, served by 50,000 drivers. The GMB union has instructed the law firm Leigh Day to apply to intervene, or be listed as an interested party, in the appeal being brought by Uber London against the TfL decision. In the application to Westminster magistrates court, GMB said it would like to participate in the appeal proceedings as it is concerned that Uber\u2019s business model puts public safety at serious risk. GMB claims that Uber encourages and incentivises drivers to work excessive hours. London Uber driver Syed Khalil, told the the Commons work and pensions committee in February that it was usual practice for drivers to work as much as 100 hours a week and claimed the company did not prevent drivers from logging on to do so. To retain their account status, Uber drivers also have to accept at least 80% of trip requests, according to the union. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in the owner of the Daily Mail and Mail Online have slumped by more than 20% after it reported a sharp drop in annual profits and warned of a tough year ahead. Daily Mail &amp; General Trust (DMGT), which also owns the Mail on Sunday and Metro newspapers and is the largest shareholder in business-to-business publisher Euromoney, said its business would be \u201cadversely affected by recent disposals and challenging conditions in some of our sectors\u201d. The shares hit a five-year low of 500p in early trading on Thursday, falling 28% at one point before closing 23.8% lower at 534.5p. DMGT is also the largest shareholder in ZPG, the company behind the property website Zoopla and the price comparison site uSwitch. It has reduced its stake in Euromoney to 49% from 67%. DMGT posted a 13% fall in adjusted profits before tax to \u00a3226m for the year to the end of September. Revenues were also down 13%,to \u00a31.66bn. The company made a statutory loss before tax of \u00a3112m, as it took a hit from writedowns totalling \u00a3206m. It wrote down the value of three investments: energy information business Genscape; and property information firms Xceligent and SiteCompli. DMGT\u2019s chief executive, Paul Zwillenberg, highlighted Mail Online\u2019s move into profit in the final quarter and the launch of new initiatives such as DailyMailTV in the US. Mail Online is also expected to make an operating profit over the coming year. Zwillenberg also pointed to cost savings in the newspaper businesses, including the closure of the Didcot printing site. He said the company had \u201cdelayered management\u201d and \u201creduced overheads\u201d following asset disposals, and described the coming year as a \u201cyear of transition\u201d. DMGT hinted at further asset sales, saying: \u201cWhere DMGT is not the best owner, further divestments will be made.\u201d Revenues for the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and Mail Online combined were \u00a3574m last year, boosted by increases in print cover prices. The website contributed \u00a3119m. The Mail businesses made an operating profit of \u00a371m. The company said that while print advertising revenues fell by 5%, digital advertising grew by 18%. It expects further growth in digital advertising revenues, helping offset declines in newspaper circulation and print advertising, but warned that \u201cadvertising market conditions [were] likely to remain volatile\u201d \u2013 mirroring the experience of rivals. The underlying rate of decline in revenues at its media business is expected to be in the mid-single digits. Steve Liechti, analyst at banking group Investec, said the outlook for the media business was worse than expected. Analysts at stockbroker Liberum downgraded their rating on DMGT shares from \u201cbuy\u201d to \u201chold\u201d, arguing that the outlook for 2018 \u201cdoes not look great on the consumer media side\u201d. Liberum\u2019s Ian Whittaker and Annick Maas said: \u201cWhat is clear is that DMGT faces another year of \u2018transformation\u2019 but it is not entirely clear when we will get the acceleration of top-line growth. \u201cThe question we would have is, if Mail Online is becoming a greater part of the group (17% of revenues in 2017) and is moving into profits and is faster growth, why is the like-for-like revenues trend going backwards as well as the margin?\u201d They also expressed concern about the writedowns. \u201cThat points to the risk of what has been DMGT\u2019s change into an almost-VC style structure where it takes multiple investments.\u201d",

Mail Online is also expected to make an operating profit over the coming year.</p> <p>Zwillenberg also pointed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/29/daily-mail-cost-cuts-dmgt\">cost savings in the newspaper businesses</a>, including the closure of the Didcot printing site. He said the company had \u201cdelayered management\u201d and \u201creduced overheads\u201d following asset disposals, and described the coming year as a \u201cyear of transition\u201d. </p> <p>DMGT hinted at further asset sales, saying: \u201cWhere DMGT is not the best owner, further divestments will be made.\u201d</p> <p>Revenues for the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and Mail Online combined were \u00a3574m last year, boosted by increases in print cover prices. The website contributed \u00a3119m. The Mail businesses made an operating profit of \u00a371m.</p> <p>The company said that while print advertising revenues fell by 5%, digital advertising grew by 18%.</p> <p>It expects further growth in digital advertising revenues, helping offset declines in newspaper circulation and print advertising, but warned that \u201cadvertising market conditions [were] likely to remain volatile\u201d \u2013 mirroring the experience of rivals. The underlying rate of decline in revenues at its media business is expected to be in the mid-single digits. </p> <p>Steve Liechti, analyst at banking group Investec, said the outlook for the media business was worse than expected.</p> <p>Analysts at stockbroker Liberum downgraded their rating on DMGT shares from \u201cbuy\u201d to \u201chold\u201d, arguing that the outlook for 2018 \u201cdoes not look great on the consumer media side\u201d.</p> <p>Liberum\u2019s Ian Whittaker and Annick Maas said: \u201cWhat is clear is that DMGT faces another year of \u2018transformation\u2019 but it is not entirely clear when we will get the acceleration of top-line growth.</p> <p>\u201cThe question we would have is, if Mail Online is becoming a greater part of the group (17% of revenues in 2017) and is moving into profits and is faster growth, why is the like-for-like revenues trend going backwards as well as the margin?\u201d</p> <p>They also expressed concern about the writedowns. \u201cThat points to the risk of what has been DMGT\u2019s change into an almost-VC style structure where it takes multiple investments.\u201d</p>",

But the mutual said it was only tiptoeing into property development and had no plans to become a volume housebuilder. The \u00a350m investment in a five-hectare (12-acre) site not far from its corporate headquarters in the town comes after customers asked Nationwide to do more to support practical new approaches to housing. Traditionally, building societies have offered mortgages but not directly developed homes. Nationwide said it would work with the local community on the design of the not-for-profit project, with building expected to start in 2019. The scheme is designed to break even through sales and rentals, and any profit will be reinvested in other Nationwide projects. The building society did not give projections about what prices or rents would be. Joe Garner, its chief executive, said: \u201cWe aim to show that it\u2019s possible to develop quality homes at fair prices. By challenging existing practice in just a small way here in Swindon and ensuring the views of locals shape our development, we hope to make an innovative contribution to the national housing debate.\u201d Nationwide\u2019s move is the latest corporate entry into the residential housing market. After the budget last week, Legal &amp; General said it would accelerate the roll-out of prefab houses made at its Leeds factory, with plans to build 1,500 homes from the end of next year and as many as 70,000 over the next decade. The build-to-rent sector is also booming, with City investors and pension funds banking on secure, long-term rental incomes to beat interest rates and inflation. The estate agent Knight Frank predicts that \u00a350bn will be invested in the sector by 2020.",
