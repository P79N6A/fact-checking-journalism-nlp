      "bodyText": "\u201cA tentative and apologetic approach that does not cut the mustard\u201d: Frank Field\u2019s description of the performance of the Pensions Regulator (TPR) at Carillion is merited. This line alone from the regulator\u2019s response to MPs\u2019 inquiries tells you why: \u201cTPR has launched an investigation to determine if there is information that suggests we should use our anti-avoidance powers.\u201d It is laughably late in the day to contemplate an anti-avoidance inquiry. Even if a successful case could be mounted, it\u2019s hard to see how significant sums could be recovered. The asset-light construction giant is bust and is being liquidated. And, even if directors\u2019 bonuses could be retrieved, the numbers will still be tiny given that the pension schemes\u2019 deficit is likely to be almost \u00a31bn. Instead, the regulator must explain why it didn\u2019t close the stable door before the horse bolted. The explosive allegation from Robin Ellison, chairman of the Carillion pension schemes, is that his trustees sought higher contributions from the company after valuations in 2008, 2011, and 2013. When the company resisted, the regulator got involved, but Ellison\u2019s letter goes on: \u201cUltimately, for all three valuations, TPR decided not to exercise its powers.\u201d That revelation does not clear Ellison entirely; he will still have to explain to MPs why he didn\u2019t resign in protest. But the regulator\u2019s inaction is more glaring \u2013 and its early explanation is not persuasive. The key passage from TPR is this: \u201cThe content of Carillion\u2019s recovery plans, and its payment of dividends, did not highlight sufficient concern to justify the use of our powers based on the group\u2019s trading strength as presented at the time in their audited accounts.\u201d Blame the auditors, then? Well, yes, the role of KPMG in the Carillion calamity is plainly significant, and the Financial Reporting Council\u2019s investigation will be the most important it has undertaken in years (especially for KPMG, since the book is still open on its role at Co-op Bank and Rolls-Royce). But TPR cannot be a prisoner to signed-off accounts. If the Carillion trustees were unhappy for a decade, why didn\u2019t the regulator take up cudgels on their behalf? Shouldn\u2019t trustees\u2019 voices count as much as KPMG\u2019s? Instead, TPR tolerated a situation in which Carillion paid more to its shareholders in dividends than it contributed to the pension schemes. Over the last two years, the score was \u00a3163m in dividends and \u00a394m in deficit recovery payments. A standard reply in these situations is that TPR is obliged to perform a balancing act. It has to protect the interests of pensioners while being mindful of a company\u2019s need to grow and invest. But come on, such trade-offs cannot be a blanket excuse for regulatory inaction. The charge against TPR is that it too readily swallows corporate pleas of poverty even as dividends are increased. At Carillion, we\u2019re told, trustees were frustrated for a decade, but the company\u2019s self-interested view of how to close the deficit, and at what pace, prevailed. Field\u2019s usual conclusion is to demand more powers for TPR. But the first question to ask is whether the body is any good at using the powers it already possesses. If the answer is no, half the problem is regulatory timidity. Melrose must show its maths Calculating pension deficits is tricky, of course. Automotive and aerospace group GKN, as it seeks to defend itself against the \u00a37bn hostile bid from Melrose, produced a menu of sorts on Monday. Pick a deficit \u2013 \u00a3400m, \u00a3700m or \u00a31.4bn, depending on your preferred basis of calculation. GKN argues that the numbers could move higher if Melrose\u2019s offer succeeds, which seems a fair point. The bidder wants to carry substantially more debt, as a percentage of earnings, so the corporate covenant could weaken and thus contributions might have to increase. For its part, Melrose points to its own \u201cimpeccable track record\u201d in improving pensioners\u2019 rights and says it has already offered to pay \u201cup to\u201d \u00a3150m into the GKN schemes if it wins. This tit-for-tat is generating more heat than light. Would an extra \u00a3150m up front satisfy the trustees? What level of regular contributions would be demanded under Melrose\u2019s ownership? Would regulatory blessing be required? Shareholders deserve firm answers before they vote on the actual takeover proposal \u2013 and Melrose, as the bidder, must show its workings. Honest Johan! EasyJet CEO\u2019s shrinking pay EasyJet is suitably embarrassed about its huge gender pay gap \u2013 a function, in large part, of the fact that 94% of its high-earning pilots are men \u2013 so one shouldn\u2019t grumble that new chief executive Johan Lundgren is volunteering to cut his salary from \u00a3740,000 to the \u00a3706,000 earned by his predecessor, Dame Carolyn McCall, in her final year. These gestures matter. But surely there\u2019s another conclusion to be drawn: easyJet\u2019s board, when offering the job to Lundgren, could have negotiated harder. That\u2019s embarrassing too.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Last week the IMF upgraded its projections for global economic growth based mostly on estimated impacts of Donald Trump\u2019s tax plan. But the growth is set to be short lived and is more about policies that increase growth now at the cost of growth later, rather than better ongoing economic performance. In its October world economic outlook, the IMF projected world GDP this year would grow by 3.7%; last week however it revised up this forecast to 3.9%. It was a significant increase and came mostly from the improved performance of advanced economies \u2013 especially the USA. The upgrades also carried over into 2019, with the prediction for USA\u2019s GDP growth up from 1.9% to 2.5%. The rather siezeable boost in the USA economy comes due to the expected impact of the Trump tax cuts, \u201cin particular the reduction in corporate tax rates and the temporary allowance for full expensing of investment\u201d. Not surprisingly, Australia\u2019s treasurer, Scott Morrison, quickly used the upgrades to talk up the need for our own company tax cuts. However within the upgrades comes little sense that the company tax cuts are a sensible way to improve growth, nor a particularly solid one. As a general rule, a stronger US economy is something Australians should welcome. Regardless of our increased dependence upon China, the reality is when the US economy is doing well, the world economy is usually doing well, and given our small open economy, that usually means Australia is doing well: Since the early 1980s, the only time Australia\u2019s GDP growth has not closely followed the USA\u2019s was during the GFC \u2013 a performance that truly does not get the credit it deserves. And given the budget-projected US GDP growth for this year and the next at 2.25% rather than 2.7% and 2.5%, it means that our economy should perform better over that time than anticipated. But we should not be too quick in lauding Trump\u2019s company tax cuts and equally desiring our own. For a start, the IMF is not really crediting the company tax cut for the upgrades. Yes, it notes \u201cin particular the reduction in the company tax rate\u201d, but it also notes that the \u201cassociated fiscal stimulus\u201d is \u201cexpected to temporarily raise US growth.\u201d And yet the tax cuts are permanent. So why is the stimulus only temporary? It\u2019s because the big driver of growth according to the IMF is the \u201cthe temporary allowance for full expensing of investment\u201d. This is where businesses are allowed to deduct the cost of depreciable assets over one year rather than amortise it over a number of years. But this only applies for purchases made before the middle of 2022. In effect, the policy is trying to get companies to invest in things now rather than later. And it thus often doesn\u2019t create new investment; rather it creates earlier investment. And as a result, the IMF notes that \u201cdue to the temporary nature of some of its provisions, the tax policy package is projected to lower growth for a few years from 2022 onwards\u201d. This is not much of a tick for the benefits of a company tax cut, if they are so feeble that the improvement in growth is swamped by the removal of another temporary measure. It aligns with the analysis from credit agency, Moody\u2019s, last week, which noted of the company tax cuts, that \u201cwith the US economy close to full employment\u201d (its unemployment rate is currently 4.1%), \u201cthe extent to which any fiscal stimulus can substantially increase growth is limited\u201d. It also noted that \u201cwe do not expect corporate tax cuts to lead to a meaningful boost in business investment.\u201d Not exactly a ringing endorsement. The reason the tax cut from 35% to 21% is not expected to drive investment is that many US firms are taking advantage of the lower tax rate to buy back shares rather than invest in new equipment or buildings. This fact is so clear that the rightwing Cato Institute, rather than suggest it is not happening, is now instead trying to suggest that it is no big deal and probably a good thing. Within the IMF\u2019s analysis is also some warnings of the impact of the tax cuts. First, it notes that the improvements in growth come because overall the tax cuts and others measures are unfunded \u2013 ie they are basically pumping money into the economy. The IMF assumes the drop in tax revenue \u201cwill not be offset by spending cuts in the near term.\u201d And that is a big assumption given the speaker of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, has already begun talking about cutting social security and Medicare funding in order to \u201ctackle the debt and the deficit\u201d. Doing so would only serve to exacerbate America\u2019s inequality problem \u2013 a problem already worsened by the tax cuts themselves, which the IMF notes, will \u201creduce the average tax rate on upper income US households relative to those in the middle and lower segment.\u201d And it sounds a warning that growth founded on policies that increase inequality \u201cincrease pressures for inward-looking policies\u201d (ie nationalistic, protectionist policies). And Trump is already moving towards higher tariffs and greater protectionist policies \u2013 all of which will reduce economic growth in the long term. As the IMF noted in a note to the G20 meeting last year, \u201chigh and persistent inequality can undermine the sustainability of growth itself\u201d \u2013 a position the Trump policies seem determined to achieve. The IMF\u2019s upgrade of the US\u2019s economic growth is in no way a cause for those in favour of company tax cuts to declare victory. If anything, it reinforces how little tax cuts improve the economy and increase the risk of higher inequality \u2013 thus reducing economic growth in the long run.

It was a significant increase and came mostly from the improved performance of advanced economies \u2013 especially the USA.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"IMF projections for 2018 GDP growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GzRmZ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The upgrades also carried over into 2019, with the prediction for USA\u2019s GDP growth up from 1.9% to 2.5%.</p> <p>The rather siezeable boost in the USA economy comes due to the expected impact of the Trump tax cuts, \u201cin particular the reduction in corporate tax rates and the temporary allowance for full expensing of investment\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/29/coalition-warned-tax-cut-promise-risks-undermining-budget\">Coalition warned tax cut promise risks undermining budget</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not surprisingly, Australia\u2019s treasurer, Scott Morrison, quickly used the upgrades to talk up the need for our own company tax cuts. However within the upgrades comes little sense that the company tax cuts are a sensible way to improve growth, nor a particularly solid one.</p> <p>As a general rule, a stronger US economy is something Australians should welcome. Regardless of our increased dependence upon China, the reality is when the US economy is doing well, the world economy is usually doing well, and given our small open economy, that usually means Australia is doing well:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Australia and USA annual GDP growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xFBgA/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Since the early 1980s, the only time Australia\u2019s GDP growth has not closely followed the USA\u2019s was during the GFC \u2013 a performance that truly does not get the credit it deserves.</p> <p>And given the budget-projected US GDP growth for this year and the next at 2.25% rather than 2.7% and 2.5%, it means that our economy should perform better over that time than anticipated.</p> <p>But we should not be too quick in lauding Trump\u2019s company tax cuts and equally desiring our own.</p> <p>For a start, the IMF is not really crediting the company tax cut for the upgrades. Yes, it notes \u201cin particular the reduction in the company tax rate\u201d, but it also notes that the \u201cassociated fiscal stimulus\u201d is \u201cexpected to temporarily raise US growth.\u201d</p> <p>And yet the tax cuts are permanent. So why is the stimulus only temporary?</p> <p>It\u2019s because the big driver of growth according to the IMF is the \u201cthe temporary allowance for full expensing of investment\u201d. This is where businesses are allowed to deduct the cost of depreciable assets over one year rather than amortise it over a number of years. But this only applies for purchases made before the middle of 2022.</p> <p>In effect, the policy is trying to get companies to invest in things now rather than later. And it thus often doesn\u2019t create new investment; rather it creates earlier investment.</p> <p>And as a result, the IMF notes that \u201cdue to the temporary nature of some of its provisions, the tax policy package is projected to lower growth for a few years from 2022 onwards\u201d.</p> <p>This is not much of a tick for the benefits of a company tax cut, if they are so feeble that the improvement in growth is swamped by the removal of another temporary measure.</p> <p>It aligns with the analysis from credit agency, Moody\u2019s, last week, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tax-cuts-limited-impact-economy-223228860.html\">which noted</a> of the company tax cuts, that \u201cwith the US economy close to full employment\u201d (its unemployment rate is currently 4.1%), \u201cthe extent to which any fiscal stimulus can substantially increase growth is limited\u201d.</p> <p>It also noted that \u201cwe do not expect corporate tax cuts to lead to a meaningful boost in business investment.\u201d</p> <p>Not exactly a ringing endorsement.</p> <p>The reason the tax cut from 35% to 21% is not expected to drive investment is that many US firms are taking advantage of the lower tax rate to buy back shares rather than invest in new equipment or buildings. This fact is so clear that the rightwing Cato Institute, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/opinion/finance/362947-share-buybacks-dont-undermine-case-for-corporate-tax-cuts\">rather than suggest it is not happening</a>, is now instead trying to suggest that it is no big deal and probably a good thing.</p> <p>Within the IMF\u2019s analysis is also some warnings of the impact of the tax cuts.</p> <p>First, it notes that the improvements in growth come because overall the tax cuts and others measures are unfunded \u2013 ie they are basically pumping money into the economy. The IMF assumes the drop in tax revenue \u201cwill not be offset by spending cuts in the near term.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2017/oct/19/cutting-company-tax-costs-money-and-middle-income-earners-will-pay\">Cutting company tax costs money and middle income earners will pay | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And that is a big assumption given the speaker of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/18/16741730/gop-agenda-medicare-social-security\">already begun talking</a> about cutting social security and Medicare funding in order to \u201ctackle the debt and the deficit\u201d. Doing so would only serve to exacerbate America\u2019s inequality problem \u2013 a problem already worsened by the tax cuts themselves, which the IMF notes, will \u201creduce the average tax rate on upper income US households relative to those in the middle and lower segment.\u201d</p> <p>And it sounds a warning that growth founded on policies that increase inequality \u201cincrease pressures for inward-looking policies\u201d (ie nationalistic, protectionist policies). And Trump is already moving towards higher tariffs and greater protectionist policies \u2013 all of which will reduce economic growth in the long term. As the IMF noted in a note to <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/np/g20/pdf/2017/062617.pdf\">the G20 meeting</a> last year, \u201chigh and persistent inequality can undermine the sustainability of growth itself\u201d \u2013 a position the Trump policies seem determined to achieve.</p> <p>The IMF\u2019s upgrade of the US\u2019s economic growth is in no way a cause for those in favour of company tax cuts to declare victory. If anything, it reinforces how little tax cuts improve the economy and increase the risk of higher inequality \u2013 thus reducing economic growth in the long run. </p> <ul> <li>Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist</li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen, the world\u2019s biggest carmaker, is under fire globally from politicians and environmentalists following revelations it helped to fund experiments in which monkeys and humans breathed in car fumes for hours at a time. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said there was an urgent need for the company to reveal the true extent of the experiments, which were commissioned by the European Research Group of Environment and Health in the Transport Sector (EUGT), a body funded by Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW. \u201cThese tests on monkeys or even on humans are not ethically justifiable in any shape or form,\u201d her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Monday. \u201cThe indignation of many people is absolutely understandable.\u201d VW is already under heavy scrutiny over its role in the \u201cdieselgate\u201d scandal, in which the carmaker manipulated tests on about 11m cars worldwide to make it appear they met air emissions tests, when in reality they exceeded them many times over when used on the road. The company said on Monday a small internal group had mistakenly pushed for the tests to be carried out and that they did not reflect VW\u2019s ethos. But industry observers said VW\u2019s excuses held little water, as the experiments had been well-documented and the results presented to managers at BMW, Daimler and VW, all of whom belonged to the EUGT, a car lobby group, which has since been disbanded. VW\u2019s supervisory board representative and chief controller, Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, said on Monday he was struggling to understand how the tests had been allowed to be carried out, calling them \u201cin no way understandable\u201d. Daimler and BMW tried to distance themselves from the tests, stressing that none of their cars had been used in the experiments. Initially reported in the New York Times, the tests, carried out in May 2015 by the New Mexico-based Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute (LRRI), involved locking 10 Java monkeys in small airtight chambers for four hours at a time. The animals were left to watch cartoons as they breathed in diesel fumes from a VW Beetle. The ultimate aim of the tests was to prove that the pollutant load of nitrogen oxide car emissions from diesel motors had measurably decreased, thanks to modern cleaning technology. In a second round of tests, the animals were forced to breathe in the fumes of a Ford F-250 used for the purposes of comparison, because the car was an older model with apparently less sophisticated filter technology. According to some reports in the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and the broadcaster NDR, the monkeys were subsequently anaesthetised and intubated, so their blood could be examined for inflammatory markers. Their lungs were then washed out and their bronchial tubes examined. According to the LRRI, the Java monkey species was chosen by the EUGT itself. The S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung reported the experiments were also carried out on 25 young and healthy human beings. According to the Stuttgarter Zeitung, the experiments were carried out at an institute of the University Clinic Aachen and involved the group having to breathe in varying different concentrations of nitric oxide after which they were physically examined for any side-effects. Revelations about the tests have only served to deepen suspicions that the industry is looking to increase the acceptance of diesel as a clean source of energy even as increasing numbers of scientific studies show the opposite to be the case. LRRI said it decided to withdraw from the EUGT-commissioned study in the autumn of 2015 following the emergence of the dieselgate scandal. \u201cAfter we learned about this fraud, we decided that the study was flawed,\u201d the LRRI\u2019s president Robert Rubin told a German newspaper. Barbara Hendricks, the German environment minister, said what was known about the tests so far was \u201cvile\u201d. \u201cThat a whole branch of industry has apparently tried to discard scientific facts with such brazen and dubious methods makes the entire thing even more horrific,\u201d she said. Those responsible, she added \u201chave not understood what is on the agenda here \u2013 to finally accept full responsibility in the diesel scandal\u201d. She said she was \u201cappalled\u201d that scientists had \u201cmade themselves available as willing supporters of such despicable experiments\u201d.",

This is because the vast majority \u2013 94% \u2013 of its pilots, who earn far more than cabin crew and other employees, are male. Only 4% of commercial pilots in the industry worldwide are female. EasyJet has set itself a target that a fifth of all new pilots recruited should be female by 2020, up from 6% in 2015 and 13% now. Last year it recruited 49 female pilots. Lundgren said: \u201cI also want to affirm my own commitment to address the gender imbalance in our pilot community which drives our overall gender pay gap. I want us not just to hit our target that 20% of our new pilots should be female by 2020 but to go further than this in the future.\u201d McCall started her new job at ITV this month. She is one of only eight female chief executives of a FTSE 100 company, a number that increased with the appointment of Anne Stevens at engineering firm GKN earlier this month. The broadcaster is paying McCall a base salary of \u00a3900,000, \u00a341,000 less than her predecessor Adam Crozier, and her pension allowance has been reduced to 15% of her salary compared with his 25%.

    "webTitle": "Pound slips amid renewed Brexit fears and dollar recovery - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With the dollar recovering from its recent weakness, and continuing uncertainty over Brexit, the pound has come under pressure today and is currently 0.63% lower at $1.4080. Meanwhile bonds prices are falling and yields rising, as central banks increasingly look to move away from their low interest rate and QE programmes which have supported markets for several years now. German and US yields in particular have move sharply higher. In the US, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation - the PCE index - was in line with expections, up from 0.1% in November to 0.2% last month. But the savings rate fell to a more than 12 year low. Elsewhere the European Union has warned Donald Trump it is ready to retaliate on trade if the US tries to crack down on imports. And cryptocurrencies were back in the spotlight on concerns about a crackdown in Japan after hackers stole $400m from the Coincheck exchange. Finally, accountancy firm KPMG is to be investigated by the UK\u2019s Financial Reporting Council over its role in the collapse of construction group Carillion. On that note, it is time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. With the recovery in the dollar, a decline in bond prices and a busy week ahead, US markets have slipped back from their record levels. As well as the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest interest rate setting meeting, there is the State of the Union address and a host of results from the likes of Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. Apple is already weighing on the markets, following reports it would make half the number of planned iPhone Xs this quarter. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped 37 points or 0.15%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.26% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.32%. Here\u2019s our full report on the EU\u2019s warning to Donald Trump over trade. Daniel Boffey writes: Brussels has warned that it stands ready to retaliate and potentially open up a transatlantic trade war if the US delivers on apparent threats to restrict European imports. The US president, Donald Trump, claimed in an interview with ITV broadcast on Sunday that the EU had been \u201cvery unfair\u201d on American exporters, and that it would \u201cmorph into something very big\u201d that would \u201cturn out to be very much to [the EU\u2019s] detriment\u201d. Washington is currently examining the case for protecting US economic interests on national security grounds, including the imposition of import tariffs on aluminium and steel. Responding to Trump\u2019s comments, a spokesman for the European commission told reporters in Brussels that the EU was ready to hit back if its importers were made to suffer. The spokesman said: \u201cFor us trade policy is not a zero sum game. It is not about winners and losers. We here in the European Union believe that trade can and should be win-win. The full report is here: The latest set of US inflation figures have risen in December in line with forecasts. The personal consumption expenditures price index - it may be a mouthful but it is the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation - climbed from 0.1% in November to 0.2% last month. On an annual basis it rose 1.5%, the same as in November. It is still below the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Meanwhile consumer spending increased by 0.4% last month, again in line with expectations. The November figure was revised upwards from an initial reading of 0.6% to 0.8%. Personal income rose 0.4%, up from 0.3% in November, while wages increased by 0.5%. The savings rate fell to 2.4% from 2.5% in November, the lowest level since September 2005. Stock markets are pretty steady at the moment, but will that last if bond yields continue to climb? On the weak pound, financial analyst Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: With little else to focus on investors turned their attention to Theresa May\u2019s most recent bout of Tory turbulence, much to the pound\u2019s displeasure. The Prime Minister is dealing with the umpteenth swell of dissent over the state of her leadership, while at the same time having to try and quash the latest beef between her warring ministers, this round sparked by leaked Whatsapp messages from climate change minister Claire Perry calling Brexit voters \u2018swivel-eyed\u2019. Add onto that the Lords constitution committee labelling the EU withdrawal bill as \u2018fundamentally flawed\u2019 just one day before the legislation is set to be debated, alongside a warning from EU leaders that the UK is \u2018not ready\u2019 to secure a divorce deal, and there was plenty for the previously soaring pound to fret about. The pound continues to slip back against the dollar, and is now down 0.66% at $1.4074. Against the euro, sterling is down 0.32% at \u20ac1.1352. As well as the dollar\u2019s recovery, the pound is being hit by renewed Brexit uncertainty, after the continuing splits in the Conservative party and the prime minister\u2019s perceived weakness. President Trump said at Davos on Friday that he wanted free and fair trade, comments which did little to assuage fears of a possible trade war. Especially since they followed the imposition of tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from China and South Korea. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: President Trump\u2019s speech on Friday did nothing to increase [concerns about a trade war], but neither did they assuage them. His comments that the US wanted free but \u201cfair\u201d trade suggested that he would not be shy in confronting what he considered unfair trade practices, potentially putting him on a collision course with China, as well as the European Union. And here\u2019s a response from Europe: On a lighter note: Is this the end of the battle for the sunbed? Thomas Cook is offering holidaymakers the chance to pre-book sun loungers, eliminating the need for the dawn dash to the pool to bag one with a towel. For \u20ac25, customers will be able to book a specific sun lounger for their entire holiday. The Anglo-German company says it is the UK\u2019s first package holiday firm to offer this service, which it is trialling at three hotels in Lanzarote, Gran Canaria and Fuerteventura from the end of February. Customers will receive an email six days before departure asking if they would like to choose their sunbed in advance. They will be able to choose their preferred spot on a pool plan featuring a compass to help them work out what time of the day areas will be in the sun or shade. Read more here: The FTSE 100 is currently managing to stay in positive territory, just. But European markets have slipped back after a bright early start. The UK\u2019s leading index is up 0.13% while Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped 0.23% and France\u2019s Cac is down 0.07%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open some 37 points lower, but Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, reckons US markets could generally be a better bet than European bourses. He said: The FTSE 100 [is] gaining ground thanks to a weaker pound and a strengthening price of copper. Rising copper prices have helped boost the commodity-heavy FTSE 100, with Anglo American, Glencore, Rio Tinto, and Antofagasta helping drive the index into the green. After last week\u2019s losses, UK traders will hope that this will represent the beginning of a resurgence for the FTSE, yet with the dollar devaluation likely to drive the pound higher yet, it makes more sense to be long US markets over their European counterparts. Today sees a somewhat serene start to what is likely to be a fairly frantic week, with the second half providing a whole host of top tier economic data points to drive market sentiment. Donald Trump\u2019s state of the union address tomorrow sees the market focus shift back to US economic prospects, and with the potential for a raft of infrastructure projects around the corner, there is another good reason to be long US stocks. Here\u2019s the Reuters report on the earlier Chinese central bank comments: China will consider including shadow banking, property financing and internet financing in its macro-prudential assessment (MPA), central bank vice governor Yi Gang wrote on Monday, according to China Finance, a publication under the People\u2019s Bank of China. The world\u2019s second-biggest economy still has problems and hidden dangers as the country\u2019s debt levels are still high while asset bubble risks have not yet been fully contained, Yi wrote. The central bank will maintain prudent and neutral monetary policy while seeking to increase flexibility and effectiveness of liquidity management, Yi said. China has conditions to keep the yuan basically stable, Yi said, adding that the regulator will look to increase the yuan\u2019s exchange rate flexibility. Back in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is down 3.5% at $11,284 on fears of a further crackdown by regulators, this time in Japan. This follows news that one exchange, Coincheck, would refund around $400m to customers after hackers stole holdings in NEM, the world\u2019s tenth biggest cryptocurrency. NEM is currently down around 8%. Fiona Cincotta at City Index said: This incident highlights one of the biggest concerns towards crypto currencies, namely security. The Japanese government have ordered Coincheck to beef up its security to prevent a repeat incident, as more authorities are clamping down on the virtual currency. Given the headline grabbing numbers, this hack is unlikely to disappear into headline history fast. Japan is one of the largest markets for cryptocurrency trading, accounting for around 30% -40% of global traded volume last month. Should this hack seriously dent confidence in virtual currencies, Bitcoin could see the selloff extended. Bond prices are coming under pressure on the growing signs that central banks are moving away from their low interest rate and QE programmes. With the US economy growing at 2.6% in the final quarter and the Bank of Japan governor saying inflation was close to reaching its target, US Treasury bonds fell and the yield [or interest rate] rose. In Europe comments over the weekend from Klass Knot, head of the Dutch central bank, that the ECB should clarify how it will end its asset purchases have also hit the bond market. Germany\u2019s yield on its five year bonds has risen to 0.004%, the first time it has been in positive territory for more than three years. French and Dutch bond yields have climbed to their highest levels since July. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: US 10s [ten year bond yields] just hit 2.71%, while German bund yields are also on the march higher with the 5-year turning positive for the first time since 2015. It does look like this is capitulation time for bond bulls as yields are entering breakout mode, which will have important consequences for equity valuations. At this stage in the cycle it makes sense for yields to be climbing but breakout beyond the 30-year trend line does signal the bond bears are here at last. A spike to 3% in the 10-year now looks very possible and a bond market rout could spook the market. China\u2019s central bank says it will keep a prudent and neutral monetary policy, but admits the country\u2019s economy still has problems, including high debt levels and the risks of an asset bubble. It added in its latest bulletin that it had the right conditions to keep the renminbi basically stable, and said a two way fluctuation in yuan rates would become the norm. Julian Dunkerton, the co-founder of Superdry, is nearly \u00a318m richer after selling part of his stake in the fashion retailer. Dunkerton, which is now the company\u2019s product and brand director, sold one million shares at the end of last week at \u00a317.80 each. That amounts to 1.23% of the company and still leaves him with more than 25%, making him its largest shareholder. Superdry shares have surged 20% over the past year but an update earlier this month saw them slip back after it revealed a 28% fall in half year profits. More on the collapse of construction group Carillion. Julia Kollewe reports: Accountancy firm KPMG is to be investigated by the UK\u2019s Financial Reporting Council over its role in the collapse of Carillion. The business secretary, Greg Clark, welcomed the investigation, which the accounting watchdog said followed inquiries made since Carillion\u2019s shock profit warning in July. The FRC said it would conduct the investigation, which will cover 2014 to 2016, and additional audit work carried out during 2017, \u201c as quickly and thoroughly as possible\u201d. Carillion went into compulsory liquidation two weeks ago with debts of \u00a31.3bn, a pension deficit of nearly \u00a31bn and a host of unfinished public contracts. The full story is here: The move comes ahead of a select committee hearing tomorrow with the FRC, the Insolvency Service and Carillion pension trustees. MPs have already accused the Pensions Regulator of failing to act while Carillion racked up debts to pay dividends and executive bonuses, as the business built up a pension deficit that reached nearly \u00a31bn by the time it collapsed this month. As expected, most European markets have opened in positive territory - just about - helped by the weakness of the pound and euro against the dollar. A weaker currency gives a boost to exporters, with the FTSE 100 in particular packed with overseas earners. The UK\u2019s leading index is up 0.14%, also benefiting from positive performances by mining groups after a 1% rise in the copper price. But drinks group Diageo, one of those which might be expected to benefit from a weaker pound, is down nearly 1% after a downgrade by analysts at RBC. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac have climbed 0.1%, Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is up 0.17% but Spain\u2019s Ibex has dipped 0.2%. Despite the prospect of further US interest rate rises this year, ING Bank believes the dollar weakness is likely to continue (notwithstanding today\u2019s move higher.) Apart from the US inflation data later and the two day Federal Reserve meeting which starts tomorrow, there is another big event which could have a major impact on the curreny. ING foreign exchange strategist Viraj Patel says: In an action-packed week for global markets, the main event will be President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address (Tueday 2100 ET) \u2013 which is set to outline the administration\u2019s 2018 policy agenda ahead of the pivotal November midterms. With US trade policy in particular focus, the burning question for investors is which type of Donald Trump will turn up: Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde? While the former manifestation may have appealed to the international elite at Davos, we would not be entirely surprised to see the more fiery characteristics of the President surface back on home soil in Washington. Indeed, with President Trump fighting low approval ratings, fresh allegations that he wanted to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller last year and with little policy progress to show (beyond the Tax Bill) \u2013 there\u2019s every chance that the \u2018America First\u2019 policy talk has a protectionist sting in the tail this week. As such, we expect global risk sentiment to remain on red alert ahead of the speech \u2013 with outside risks that USD/JPY could fall to the 107.00 level on a more contentious Trump State of the Union address. As for the dollar\u2019s broader trajectory, it will now be very difficult for Washington to put the \u2018weak dollar\u2019 genie back in the bottle. The damage is already done \u2013 and with structural factors \u2013 such as a late US economic cycle, relative US asset valuations and the twin current account and fiscal deficits \u2013 all supporting a weaker dollar trend, the naturally tendency will be for the greenback to fall over the course of 2018. Add a US political and policy uncertainty premium into the mix \u2013 and the dollar\u2019s decline could transpire quicker than what we had initially expected. The weaker pound and euro are expected to give some support to stock markets when they open.: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The dollar has been under pressure for some time now, and is set for its worst start to a year for around 30 years. Conversely US stock markets are making their best start for the same period, partly due to that very dollar weakness. Concerns that President Trump\u2019s tax reforms will add to the already hefty US deficit have undermined sentiment for the US currency, as has the prospect of a trade war which picked up pace last week as the US slapped tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from China and South Korea. Contrasting comments at Davos did not help. Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said he didn\u2019t mind a weak dollar, then Trump said virtually the opposite a day or so later. But the weakness in the dollar looks like it might be starting to attract some bargain hunters, with the currency regaining a little ground in Asia and edging higher in Europe. And although the Federal Reserve is expected to make no move on interest rates at this week\u2019s meeting - the swansong for Janet Yellen as Fed chair - further rises are expected this year. Later today come some US inflation figures which are likely to influence whether the dollar can hold onto its gains. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said: Investors will now look ahead to the release of US PCE [personal consumption expenditure] figures, the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation. Month on month inflation is expected to have increased 0.2% in December, from 0.1%. Meanwhile, on a annualised basis a constant reading of 1.5% is forecast. Given the ongoing concerns at the Fed over the sluggish inflation in the US, a higher reading this afternoon, could help cement the dollar\u2019s bounce. At the moment the dollar\u2019s recovery has left the pound 0.28% lower at $1.4128 while against the euro sterling has dipped 0.1% to \u20ac1.1376. As well as being affected by the dollar\u2019s recovery, the pound is being undermined by renewed Brexit concerns, with peers saying the EU withdrawal bill needs to be withdrawn and the prime minister under growing pressure amid calls for the chancellor to be sacked. The US PCE figures are due at 1.30pm GMT, which is the main item on the economic agenda.",

ING foreign exchange strategist Viraj Patel says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In an action-packed week for global markets, the main event will be President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address (Tueday 2100 ET) \u2013 which is set to outline the administration\u2019s 2018 policy agenda ahead of the pivotal November midterms. With US trade policy in particular focus, the burning question for investors is which type of Donald Trump will turn up: Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde?</p> <p>While the former manifestation may have appealed to the international elite at Davos, we would not be entirely surprised to see the more fiery characteristics of the President surface back on home soil in Washington. Indeed, with President Trump fighting low approval ratings, fresh allegations that he wanted to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller last year and with little policy progress to show (beyond the Tax Bill) \u2013 there\u2019s every chance that the \u2018America First\u2019 policy talk has a protectionist sting in the tail this week. As such, we expect global risk sentiment to remain on red alert ahead of the speech \u2013 with outside risks that USD/JPY could fall to the 107.00 level on a more contentious Trump State of the Union address.</p> <p>As for the dollar\u2019s broader trajectory, it will now be very difficult for Washington to put the \u2018weak dollar\u2019 genie back in the bottle. The damage is already done \u2013 and with structural factors \u2013 such as a late US economic cycle, relative US asset valuations and the twin current account and fiscal deficits \u2013 all supporting a weaker dollar trend, the naturally tendency will be for the greenback to fall over the course of 2018. Add a US political and policy uncertainty premium into the mix \u2013 and the dollar\u2019s decline could transpire quicker than what we had initially expected.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a6ecfdfe4b0d3de59ee3f4f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T07:40:57.568Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The weaker pound and euro are expected to give some support to stock markets when they open.:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/957863725611929600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">European Opening Calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FTSE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FTSE</a> 7678 +0.16%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DAX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DAX</a> 13378 +0.28%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CAC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CAC</a> 5546 +0.31%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MIB</a> 23899 +0.17%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IBEX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#IBEX</a> 10631 +0.34%</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/957863725611929600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 29, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a6ec8bbe4b03d22f608b5cd\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T07:38:51.845Z\">7.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Agenda: Currencies in focus as dollar strengthens</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>The dollar has been under pressure for some time now, and is set for its worst start to a year for around 30 years. Conversely US stock markets are making their best start for the same period, partly due to that very dollar weakness.</p> <p>Concerns that President Trump\u2019s tax reforms will add to the already hefty US deficit have undermined sentiment for the US currency, as has the prospect of a trade war which picked up pace last week as the US slapped tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from China and South Korea.</p> <p>Contrasting comments at Davos did not help. Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said he didn\u2019t mind a weak dollar, then Trump said virtually the opposite a day or so later.</p> <p>But the weakness in the dollar looks like it might be starting to attract some bargain hunters, with the currency regaining a little ground in Asia and edging higher in Europe.</p> <p>And although the Federal Reserve is expected to make no move on interest rates at this week\u2019s meeting - the swansong for Janet Yellen as Fed chair - further rises are expected this year. </p> <p>Later today come some US inflation figures which are likely to influence whether the dollar can hold onto its gains. Jasper Lawler at London Capital Group said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Investors will now look ahead to the release of US PCE [personal consumption expenditure] figures, the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation. Month on month inflation is expected to have increased 0.2% in December, from 0.1%. Meanwhile, on a annualised basis a constant reading of 1.5% is forecast. Given the ongoing concerns at the Fed over the sluggish inflation in the US, a higher reading this afternoon, could help cement the dollar\u2019s bounce.</p> </blockquote> <p>At the moment the dollar\u2019s recovery has left the pound 0.28% lower at $1.4128 while against the euro sterling has dipped 0.1% to \u20ac1.1376.</p> <p>As well as being affected by the dollar\u2019s recovery, the pound is being undermined by renewed Brexit concerns, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/29/eu-withdrawal-bill-major-rewrites-house-of-lords-committee-brexit\">peers saying the EU withdrawal bill needs to be withdrawn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/28/may-urged-clarify-brexit-position-face-no-confidence-vote\">the prime minister under growing pressure amid calls for the chancellor to be sacked.</a></p> <p>The US PCE figures are due at 1.30pm GMT, which is the main item on the economic agenda.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-01-29T12:11:42.625Z\">at 12.11pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Three decades after Ikea first arrived in the UK, urging its population to chuck out their chintz, there are now few homes left without a birch veneered side table, a blue plastic laundry bag, or a shaky shelving system. Ingvar Kamprad, the Swedish company\u2019s founder who has died at the age of 91, leaves behind not only a planet covered in blonde-wood bookcases and allen key-assembled chairs, but also one with a completely different attitude to furniture and shopping. When the first customers were welcomed into a sprawling blue warehouse in Warrington in 1987, handed a stubby pencil and left to roam its assembled worlds, it was a retail experience like no other. Ikea\u2019s winning formula was to lead you through curated rooms \u2013 thereby suggesting other things you might not have realised you wanted (and probably didn\u2019t) \u2013 before allowing you into a \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d warehouse of cardboard boxes piled high. This cleverly fused domestic stagecraft with the feel of a discount, no-frills cash-and-carry, leaving shoppers in no doubt that they were getting a bargain. Overnight, furniture was transformed from being a thing of weighty heirlooms to be passed on to grandchildren, to something more fleeting and disposable. The decision to buy a new sofa was no longer momentous, but something that you might change in a few years, or update with a different coloured cover. In terms of design, it\u2019s generally simple, functional, cheery stuff \u2013 a winning combination that, as the interior of practically every UK home attests, is hard to resist. The Ikea model also reflects the society it serves: a house is now rarely a home for life, but a temporary base, until a rent increase or shift in circumstances forces you to move on without hauling all your furniture with you. Not that you would necessarily want to, given the inevitable creaks and dents some of Ikea\u2019s products develop after a few years of use. Like a high-street fashion store, Ikea has been able to change with the seasons and evolve its lines according to tastes. Warrington\u2019s opening display from 1987 had many favourites (a pair of Klippan sofas frame a couple of Lack coffee tables on a white tufted rug) but they are sporting dazzling 80s styles: the sofas are decked out in a jazzy costume that combines tribal patterns with a raver\u2019s rainbow palette of pink, orange, purple and lime green. The 1990s saw the collection whitewashed with a wave of blonde wood and neutral tones, while in the 2000s Ikea branched out, featuring more collaborations with named designers, in a bid to appeal to an increasingly savvy audience. Last year\u2019s PS collection \u2013 \u201cfor the fiercely independent\u201d \u2013 contained a folding sofa that can hang on a wall, a pillow that becomes a quilt, and a self-watering pot that helps keep unattended plants alive for two weeks. Recycled materials also loomed large \u2013 a crucial aspect for a company that already consumes 1% of all timber on the planet and has been accused of fuelling our throwaway culture. Ikea\u2019s motto \u2013 \u201cTo create a better everyday life for the many people\u201d \u2013 is inscribed on the wall of its home in \u00c4lmhult, Sm\u00e5land, and Kamprad is one of the few who can claim to have democratised design. Many before him pledged to bring high design to the masses, but few managed it. The doyen of mid-century modernism, Charles Eames, declared his job was to get \u201cthe best to the greatest number of people for the least\u201d, yet his simple plastic dining chair sells today for \u00a3350. Restaurateur and lifestyle tycoon Terence Conran wanted to place contemporary design within the reach of everyone, but his eponymous shops now represent the pinnacle of overpriced luxury homewares. Ikea tells the opposite story, with its cheap and cheerful products gaining such an iconic aura that others have flocked to copy them. When a high-end Spanish fashion house designs a homage to your 40p plastic shopping bag and tries to flog it for \u00a31,600, and your DIY self-assembly principles inspire an whole genre of \u201cIkea hackers\u201d, you\u2019ve probably done something right. Pass the F\u00e4rgrik: our Ikea top 10 Lack coffee table It\u2019s hard to argue with a \u00a37 table, but I\u2019ve never been fond of the appropriately named Lack. Perhaps it\u2019s the chubby proportions, with its legs the same width as the top, which give it an awkward, lumbering appearance. Or maybe its the glossy veneered surface that\u2019s always chipped or dented at the corners. Or the way the legs manage to work their way loose. If you have to get one, it\u2019s best disguised with a tangle of trailing pot plants or hidden under piles of books. Malm bed It is estimated that 10% of Europe\u2019s population was conceived in an Ikea bed, and the chances is are it was in a Malm, the company\u2019s best-selling bed frame. A few sheets of birch veneered particle board is a pretty depressing form for the cradle of civilisation to take, and nothing screams My First Bed more than that big pointless headboard. Allemansr\u00e4tten meatballs One of the main reasons to go to Ikea, the company\u2019s iconic meatballs make every relationship-testing trip to the furniture warehouse worth it in the end. With a momentous name that means \u201cevery man\u2019s right\u201d in Swedish, and a list of ingredients on the packet that includes unspecified \u201cmeat (84%)\u201d, they are hard to beat with mashed potatoes and a dollop of lingonberry jam. (Those on a budget can enjoy even cheaper unspecified meat in the form of the 60p hotdog.) Klippan sofa The staple of every student house, the Klippan sofa was first designed in 1979 and has changed little since \u2013 but it is kept up to date with a range of \u201cexclusive\u201d fabric covers each year (often found in the sales bin at the end of the warehouse). Rarely to be seen without wrinkled upholstery, or one of its annoying plastic tubes popping out of the gap between the seat and the arm, it\u2019s the bottom of the bargain basement of seating, short of curling up on the floor. Ribba frame When the kind of art you buy costs less than having it framed, there\u2019s nothing more handy than one of the off-the-peg Ribba frames. It was one of Ikea\u2019s best basics until recently, when the company decided to stop using glass, putting cheap sheets of bowed acrylic in its place. F\u00e4rgrik mug The everyday workhorse of coffee mugs, there is nary an office kitchen in the land without a few chipped F\u00e4rgriks lurking in the cupboard. Its little one-finger handle is a bit annoying, but at least the tapering form and smaller base means it doesn\u2019t take up so much room on your cluttered desk. Po\u00e4ng chair A design that bears a substantial debt to Finnish designer Alvar Aalto, the Po\u00e4ng celebrated its 40th birthday last year and has sold over 30 million units worldwide. Its laminated plywood frame and cantilevered form gives it a comfortable bounce, but it has always had an orthopaedic air, looking like the kind of thing found arranged in a circle in a retirement home. Frosta stool One of Ikea\u2019s simplest and best designs, embodying Scandi simplicity \u2013 perhaps because it\u2019s copied straight from another of Aalto\u2019s design classics. He designed a remarkably similar plywood stool with bent legs in 1933, which continues to be manufactured by Artek \u2013 and retails for more than 10 times the price of the Ikea knock-off. Billy bookcase Churned out of the Gyllensvaans Mobler factory in Kattilstorp, a tiny village in southern Sweden, at a rate of one every three seconds, the Billy bookcase has become the most ubiquitous Ikea product in the world, counting over 60 million \u2013 nearly one for every 100 people. As a straightforward rack of adjustable shelves, its main virtue is anonymity, dissolving into the background behind your books. Frakta bag Dubbed \u201cthe most hardworking bag in the world,\u201d the woven plastic Frakta is the the king of carrier bags, whether you\u2019re using it to haul your flat-pack furniture home, or throwing it over your head as a hasty cagoule. Such is the blue bag\u2019s iconic status, it has spawned a \u00a31,600 version by Balenciaga, made in \u201cwrinkled, glazed leather\u201d, and an enthusiastic following of \u201chackers\u201d who have used the bags to make everything from baseball caps to flip-flops.",

This cleverly fused domestic stagecraft with the feel of a discount, no-frills cash-and-carry, leaving shoppers in no doubt that they were getting a bargain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d250e01a88e14c480db7c5b36f7ce00204574e09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d250e01a88e14c480db7c5b36f7ce00204574e09/0_143_4548_5684/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ikea\u2019s founder Ingvar Kamprad in 1965.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ikea\u2019s founder Ingvar Kamprad in 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Inter Ikea Systems BV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Overnight, furniture was transformed from being a thing of weighty heirlooms to be passed on to grandchildren, to something more fleeting and disposable. The decision to buy a new sofa was no longer momentous, but something that you might change in a few years, or update with a different coloured cover.<br></p> <p>In terms of design, it\u2019s generally simple, functional, cheery stuff \u2013 a winning combination that, as the interior of practically every UK home attests, is hard to resist. The Ikea model also reflects the society it serves: a house is now rarely a home for life, but a temporary base, until a rent increase or shift in circumstances forces you to move on without hauling all your furniture with you. Not that you would necessarily want to, given the inevitable creaks and dents some of Ikea\u2019s products develop after a few years of use.</p> <p>Like a high-street fashion store, Ikea has been able to change with the seasons and evolve its lines according to tastes. Warrington\u2019s opening display from 1987 had many favourites (a pair of Klippan sofas frame a couple of Lack coffee tables on a white tufted rug) but they are sporting dazzling 80s styles: the sofas are decked out in a jazzy costume that combines tribal patterns with a raver\u2019s rainbow palette of pink, orange, purple and lime green.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0bcb14de7a5d3837b27906a7f6c2f8c806971633\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bcb14de7a5d3837b27906a7f6c2f8c806971633/0_0_3008_1805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rainbow palette \u2026 the 1980s room at the Ikea museum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rainbow palette \u2026 the 1980s room at the Ikea museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 1990s saw the collection whitewashed with a wave of blonde wood and neutral tones, while in the 2000s Ikea branched out, featuring more collaborations with named designers, in a bid to appeal to an increasingly savvy audience. <a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/us/en/ikea-collections/ikea_ps_2017/index.html\">Last year\u2019s PS collection</a> \u2013 \u201cfor the fiercely independent\u201d \u2013 contained a folding sofa that can hang on a wall, a pillow that becomes a quilt, and a self-watering pot that helps keep unattended plants alive for two weeks. </p> <p>Recycled materials also loomed large \u2013 a crucial aspect for a company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/ikea-sustainability-forest-positive-karelia\">that already consumes 1% of all timber on the planet</a> and has been accused of fuelling our throwaway culture.

      "bodyText": "Brussels has warned that it stands ready to retaliate and potentially open up a transatlantic trade war if the US delivers on apparent threats to restrict European imports. The US president, Donald Trump, claimed in an interview with ITV broadcast on Sunday that the EU had been \u201cvery unfair\u201d on American exporters, and that it would \u201cmorph into something very big\u201d that would \u201cturn out to be very much to [the EU\u2019s] detriment\u201d. Washington is currently examining the case for protecting US economic interests on national security grounds, including the imposition of import tariffs on aluminium and steel. Responding to Trump\u2019s comments, a spokesman for the European commission told reporters in Brussels that the EU was ready to hit back if its importers were made to suffer. The spokesman said: \u201cFor us trade policy is not a zero sum game. It is not about winners and losers. We here in the European Union believe that trade can and should be win-win. \u201cWe also believe that while trade has to be open and fair it also has to be rules-based. The European Union stands ready to react swiftly and appropriately in case our exports are affected by any restrictive trade measures by the United States.\u201d Asked what measures could be taken by Brussels, the spokesman said he would be \u201cbetter understood if I don\u2019t elaborate any further\u201d. In his interview with Piers Morgan, Trump had spoken of his own experience dealing with the EU. He has previously complained to its leaders that, as a businessman, the bloc had made it difficult for him to set up golf courses. Trump, who has described Brexit as a great thing, told Morgan: \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of problems with European Union, and it may morph into something very big from that standpoint, from a trade standpoint. \u201cWe cannot get our product in. It\u2019s very, very tough. And yet they send their product to us \u2013 no taxes, very little taxes. It\u2019s very unfair. \u201cThey\u2019re not the only one, by the way. I could name many countries and places that do. But the European Union has been very, very unfair to the United States. And I think it will turn out to be very much to their detriment.\u201d The comments appeared to bring closer the possibility of a clash over trade between the EU and the US. Last summer, the EU commissioner for trade, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, warned that, should such a \u201ctrade war\u201d between the US and the EU be waged, it would be \u201cextremely unfortunate\u201d for the whole world. In a formal submission last month to the US steel investigation, the European commission had said any \u201csweeping measure targeting many steel products and all countries for national security reasons is not justified\u201d. On Saturday, there was great relief in Belfast after a surprise ruling preventing the US from imposing a 292% import tariffs on planes partly made by British workers. The US commerce department said in December that the UK and Canada had given aerospace firm Bombardier, which employs over a thousand people in Northern Ireland, unfair subsidies. However, the case, which centred on a complaint by US rival Boeing, was dismissed by the US International Trade Commission (ITC), in a move which was also warmly welcomed in Downing Street.",

      "bodyText": "The accountancy firm KPMG is to be investigated by the UK\u2019s Financial Reporting Council over its role in the collapse of constrution firm Carillion. The business secretary, Greg Clark, welcomed the investigation, which the accounting watchdog said followed inquiries made since Carillion\u2019s shock profit warning in July. The FRC said it would conduct the investigation, which will cover 2014 to 2016 and additional audit work carried out during 2017, \u201cas quickly and thoroughly as possible\u201d. Carillion, which was involved in the HS2 rail link and the revamp of Battersea Power station, as well as providing services such as cleaning prisons, went into compulsory liquidation two weeks ago with debts of \u00a31.3bn, a pension deficit of nearly \u00a31bn and a host of unfinished public contracts. John Laing Infrastructure Fund, one of Europe\u2019s biggest investors in public infrastructure projects, said on Monday it was working to find new facilities management companies for nine public-private partnership (PPP) contracts \u2013 four schools, four relating to emergency services and one road project. This will cost John Laing \u00a33m. The FRC investigation will consider whether KPMG breached any rules, in particular the ethical and technical standards for auditors. Several areas of KPMG\u2019s work will be examined including estimates and recognition of revenue on significant contracts and accounting for pensions. KPMG said it would cooperate fully with the FRC\u2019s investigation and it believed it had conducted its role as Carillion\u2019s auditor \u201cappropriately and responsibly\u201d. The FRC is working closely with the official receiver, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Insolvency Service and the Pensions Regulator. Carillion is under investigation by the FCA, which is scrutinising its announcements between 7 December 2016 and 10 July 2017. The shadow pensions minister, Jack Dromey, said the system of oversight at Carillion had clearly failed. He added that 28,000 workers were now paying the price with their jobs and pensions. \u201cThe responsibility falls upon the government, the regulators, the board, the trustees and the asset managers,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cIt was a bonanza for the board and for the shareholders and that cannot be right. There needs to be fundamental reform to pension oversight, but in the here and now the trustees need to be called to account,\u201d Dromey said. The GMB union was equally scathing about the \u201cbroken system\u201d that allowed the corporate failure to happen and \u201cmust change\u201d. Its national secretary, Rehana Azam, said: \u201cThe more we see, the more it appears that the workers are paying the price for the failures of corporate bosses and government ministers.\u201d News of the FRC investigation came as Frank Field, the chair of the Commons work and pensions committee, accused Carillion of trying to \u201cwriggle out of its obligations to its pensioners for the last 10 years\u201d. Instead of tackling its growing pension deficit, he said, the company paid out hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends to shareholders and \u201chandsome\u201d pay packets to bosses. Field added that the Pensions Regulator\u2019s investigation was \u201cmuch too late for the pensioners, who will inevitably now receive reduced benefits through the Pension Protection Fund, and too late for the PPF levy payers, who will pick up the tab. The Pensions Regulator has been aware of problems in Carillion since at least 2008, but there is little evidence of any hard action.\u201d Carilllion has 13 UK defined benefit pension schemes with 27,000 members. Robert Branagh, president of the Pensions Management Institute, said: \u201cToo many Carillion workers heading for the PPF would originally have had public sector arrangements working for the NHS, Prison Service and other government departments before transferring over to the Carillion scheme when their contracts passed over.\u201d The work and pensions and business committees have started a joint inquiry into the collapse of Carillion. On Tuesday, MPs will quiz Robin Ellison, chair of trustees of Carillion\u2019s defined benefit pension scheme, as well as the heads of the FRC and the Insolvency Service.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Gas power plant operators will scoop millions of pounds in state subsidies in coming days to go on standby next winter, but the owner of the UK\u2019s largest gas fleet has warned the fossil fuel faces an uncertain future as a cornerstone of UK energy. Auctions starting on Tuesday for contracts in the capacity market, the government\u2019s insurance policy for ensuring reliable electricity supplies, are crucial to the survival of gas plants. But nuclear, renewables and energy imported from European markets could change British energy provision within two decades, according to Tom Glover, the UK chair of German energy group RWE. Glover said the outlook for new gas plants \u2013 quicker and cheaper to build than atomic sites or offshore windfarms \u2013 remained unclear. \u201cIt\u2019s uncertain, when you look across 15 years. You\u2019ve got to look at how interconnectors [power cables to other countries], how new nuclear, renewables will develop. It\u2019s very uncertain,\u201d he said. Glover\u2019s caution comes despite the government confirming the phase-out of coal. Gas has cemented itself as the top source of electricity over the past two years as coal declined dramatically in the face of a carbon tax. The North Sea\u2019s gas, together with pipelines from Europe and ships from Qatar, regularly supplies more than 40% of the UK\u2019s power, and on cold, still days earlier in the month has at times been providing nearly 60%. This month the government spelled out how it would force the last of Britain\u2019s eight coal plants to close in October 2025 to meet climate change goals, and how that would help gas. Officials said they expected the plan would lower the cost of funding gas plants, and lead to higher revenues because the power stations would be used more often. But a look at the official estimates of how much new gas capacity will be built in coming years helps explain Glover\u2019s concern, despite the current dominance of gas. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) this month revised the amount of new gas plants it expects to be built by 2035 to 6GW, down from the 14GW it predicted last year. In comparison, its forecast for new renewables, which it expects to generate more power than gas by 2020, remained largely the same. The economics of gas-fired power stations today largely hinge on the capacity market. Peter Atherton, energy analyst at Cornwall Insight, said: \u201c[Large gas plants] are entirely dependent on the capacity market really, it needs to cover something like 60-80% of the economics of those plants. That leaves maybe only 20% of the economics to the wholesale market,.\u201d The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) calculates that \u00a33.4bn worth of capacity market subsidies have already been promised to power station operators, many of them gas-fired operations. Yet so far the scheme has failed to bring forward any new plants on the scale of the large ones built during the \u201cdash for gas\u201d of the 1990s. Gas plant owners complain that, despite reforms over the past year that should diminish the role of small local power stations and battery storage plants, the capacity market is still not a level playing field. They are concerned by competition in auctions for capacity market contracts next month from new interconnectors \u2013 long-distance power cables \u2013 being planned for the early 2020s to Belgium and France. Gas supporters argue those interconnectors can compete for a lower price because they do not have to pay the same costs as gas operators in the UK, such as the carbon tax. Experts think the price of the contracts awarded in the auctions will be the same or lower as previous years, because of how many firms are bidding for them. Bernstein bank expects prices for the four-year ahead auction to clear at \u00a318-19 per kilowatt, compared with \u00a322.50/kW last year. There is little comfort in wholesale gas prices either, which are historically relatively low, even after a brief surge in December during disruptions to European gas supplies. Some companies have begun to transform their portfolios. British Gas owner Centrica sold off the last of its large-scale gas power stations in 2018, to focus on smaller plants. Mark Futyan, Centrica\u2019s merchant power director, said: \u201cThe rapid expansion of renewable energy has created a growing need for flexible power that has in turn triggered a shift in focus from large centralised power plants towards smaller units that can respond quickly to changes in demand.\u201d Despite this seemingly gloomy picture for big gas plants, companies are either keeping them running or exploring building new ones. SSE looks likely to keep Scotland\u2019s last fossil fuel power station open at Peterhead in Aberdeenshire, after it generated fears from unions by announcing a review of the plant a year ago. It also hopes to build a new plant in North Lincolnshire if it can secure a contract in the capacity market. Drax Group is looking to convert its coal power units in North Yorkshire to a huge 3.5GW gas plant. RWE is consulting this year on plans for a major new 2.5GW gas power plant at its former biomass power station at Tilbury, Essex. Glover said that despite uncertainty, gas will remain a key component of power supplies, especially if electric cars reverse years of falling demand.",

That leaves maybe only 20% of the economics to the wholesale market,.\u201d</p> <p>The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) calculates that \u00a33.4bn worth of capacity market subsidies have already been promised to power station operators, many of them gas-fired operations.</p> <p>Yet so far the scheme has failed to bring forward any new plants on the scale of the large ones built during the \u201cdash for gas\u201d of the 1990s.</p> <p>Gas plant owners complain that, despite reforms over the past year that should diminish the role of <a href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/embedded-benefits-consultation-cmp264-and-cmp265-minded-decision-and-draft-impact-assessment\">small local power stations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/contracts-for-difference-and-capacity-market-scheme-update-2017\">battery storage plants</a>, the capacity market is still not a level playing field.</p> <p>They are concerned by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.emrdeliverybody.com/Capacity%20Markets%20Document%20Library/Capacity%20Market%20Register%202021-22%20(T-4).xlsx\">competition in auctions for capacity market contracts next month from new interconnectors</a> \u2013 long-distance power cables \u2013 being planned for the early 2020s to Belgium and France. </p> <p>Gas supporters argue those interconnectors can compete for a lower price because they do not have to pay the same costs as gas operators in the UK, such as the carbon tax. </p> <p>Experts think the price of the contracts awarded in the auctions will be the same or lower as previous years, because of how many firms are bidding for them. Bernstein bank expects prices for the four-year ahead auction to clear at \u00a318-19 per kilowatt, compared with \u00a322.50/kW last year.</p> <p>There is little comfort in wholesale gas prices either, which are historically relatively low, even after a brief surge in December <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/12/oil-price-hits-30-month-high-north-sea-ineos-pipeline-closure\">during disruptions to European gas supplies</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/02/interconnectors-zip/giv-3902OJwUTTQPuHzf\" data-alt=\"interconnectors\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/02/interconnectors-zip/giv-3902OJwUTTQPuHzf\">interconnectors</a> </figure>  <p>Some companies have begun to transform their portfolios. British Gas owner Centrica <a href=\"https://www.centrica.com/news/centrica-sell-langage-and-south-humber-bank-gas-fired-power-stations\">sold off the last of its large-scale gas power stations in 2018</a>, to focus on smaller plants. </p> <p>Mark Futyan, Centrica\u2019s merchant power director, said: \u201cThe rapid expansion of renewable energy has created a growing need for flexible power that has in turn triggered a shift in focus from large centralised power plants towards smaller units that can respond quickly to changes in demand.\u201d </p> <p>Despite this seemingly gloomy picture for big gas plants, companies are either keeping them running or exploring building new ones.<br></p> <p>SSE looks likely to keep Scotland\u2019s last fossil fuel power station open at Peterhead in Aberdeenshire, after it generated fears from unions by <a href=\"http://sse.com/newsandviews/allarticles/2017/02/2017-capacity-market-year-ahead-auction/\">announcing a review of the plant a year ago</a>. It also <a href=\"http://sse.com/whatwedo/ourprojectsandassets/thermal/keadby2/\">hopes</a> to build a new plant in North Lincolnshire if it can secure a contract in the capacity market.</p> <p>Drax Group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/19/drax-coal-free-future-pre-tax-loss-power-station\">is looking to convert its coal power units in North Yorkshire to a huge 3.5GW gas plant</a>. RWE is consulting this year on plans for a major new 2.5GW gas power plant at its former biomass power station at Tilbury, Essex.</p> <p>Glover said that despite uncertainty, gas will remain a key component of power supplies, especially if electric cars reverse years of falling demand.</p>",

Julian Dunkerton sold 1m shares \u2013 1.23% of the company, which was recently renamed from SuperGroup \u2013 at \u00a317.80 a share, according to a stock exchange announcement. Dunkerton, who founded the firm in 1985 with James Holder out of their Cult Clothing business and retains a hands-on role as Superdry\u2019s product and brand director, remains the biggest shareholder, with a 25.36% stake. Nearly two years ago, he cashed in shares worth more than \u00a353m to fund his divorce settlement. The fall in sterling since the Brexit vote proved a boon for Superdry, boosting the fashion brand\u2019s performance overseas, although sales growth has slowed recently. The brand has also benefited from its high-profile collaboration with the actor Idris Elba. Superdry opened 50 new stores across 23 countries in the six months to the end of October, taking the total to more than 600. However, sales growth at its existing stores halved to 6.3%, with sales slowing in the run-up to Christmas. Last September, Dunkerton and Holder launched a bonus scheme to share a fifth of their share price gains with the fashion brand\u2019s 4,500 employees if the stock price hit an \u00a318-per-share target. It went through that level in October and hit an all-time high of \u00a320.76 in early January. The shares, which floated on the stock market at \u00a35 in 2010, were changing hands at \u00a318.03 on Monday. They have gained 16% over the past 12 months. If the shares rose by \u00a35 above the \u00a318 target, staff would share a \u00a330m bonus. This would mean a \u00a32,000 bonus for the company\u2019s 2,600 full-time shop staff and junior head office employees. Store managers would collect between \u00a328,000 and \u00a375,000, while executive team members would get at least \u00a3300,000. Part-time employees will benefit, on a pro-rata basis.

The House of Commons work and pensions committee, which is investigating Carillion\u2019s collapse into compulsory liquidation two weeks ago, criticised the Pensions Regulator for allowing Carillion\u2019s pension trustee to defer pension deficit contributions in September in a bid to keep it afloat by enabling more borrowing. The committee\u2019s comments came as it published a letter from Robin Ellison, chairman of Carillion (DB) Pension Trustee Limited, the trustee of six of the company\u2019s defined-benefit pension schemes. Ellison disclosed that Carillion had regular meetings with the Pensions Regulator from 2008 onwards. Carillion collapsed with debts of \u00a31.3bn and a host of unfinished public contracts. There are varying estimates of Carillion\u2019s pension deficit. Ellison\u2019s letter says the trustee valued it at \u00a3990m at the end of 2016, while the Pension Protection Fund\u2019s valuation is \u00a3800m and the pension liability on a buy-out basis \u2013 the estimated cost for an insurance company to buy out the accrued benefits \u2013 is \u201cnearer \u00a32bn\u201d. However, the regulator will focus on a figure between \u00a3800m and \u00a3990m, because no insurer is expected to take on the pension scheme liabilities. Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Carillion has been trying to wriggle out of its obligations to its pensioners for the last 10 years. The purported cashflow problems did of course not prevent them shelling out dividends and handsome pay packets for those at the top. \u201cThis culminated in negotiating deficit contributions away entirely last autumn to enable more borrowing. Remarkably, this was endorsed by the trustees and the Pensions Regulator.\u201d Field said the Pensions Regulator had questions to answer. \u201cThey have been sniffing around Carillion \u2013 at the trustees\u2019 behest \u2013 since at least 2008, though it is not apparent to what effect. When 10 years later the company collapses with \u00a329m in the bank and \u00a32bn in pension liabilities it doesn\u2019t look good for them.\u201d The Pensions Regulator confirmed it had been working with Carillion and the pension scheme trustees for a number of years. \u201cThe current regulatory framework attempts to balance the needs of a scheme and its members with the needs of an employer to invest in their ongoing business \u2013 this should be reflected in the length and structure of the recovery plan. \u201cThe content of Carillion\u2019s recovery plans, and its payment of dividends, did not highlight sufficient concern to justify the use of our powers based on the group\u2019s trading strength as presented at the time in their audited accounts. However, it is clear from the company\u2019s announcements since July that their underlying profitability was significantly weaker than market understanding or the position set out in prior year accounts.\u201d The Pensions Regulator\u2019s powers include enforcing a schedule of pension contributions, appointing independent trustees, banning trustees who are deemed substandard, and issuing improvement notices directing employers or pension schemes to tackle any problems. After analysing Ellisons\u2019s letter, the work and pensions committee said Carillion had been \u201cfalling short\u201d of what the trustee expected it to contribute to pension schemes since 2008. The company pointed to cashflow problems in 2011 and 2013 \u2013 but paid more than \u00a370m in dividends in both those years. Ellison will be quizzed by MPs from the work and pensions committee and the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee as part of their joint inquiry into Carillion\u2019s collapse on Tuesday. Carillion ran up debts and sold assets so it could continue to pay dividends to shareholders between 2012 and 2016, according to a parliamentary paper published last week. It paid out \u00a3217m more in dividends than it generated in cash. Its debts surged from \u00a3242m to an estimated \u00a31.3bn in the eight years to January 2018. Carillion has 13 UK defined benefit pension schemes with 27,000 members. Its pension deficit is one of the largest among FTSE 350 companies.",

      "bodyText": "Economic growth in the UK is expected to slow in the first few months of 2018 as high inflation, weak consumer confidence and uncertainty surrounding Brexit discourage high street spending and investment. A series of business and consumer surveys pointed to lower growth, ending a strong run that culminated in a rise in GDP growth to 0.5% in the last quarter of 2017. Lloyds Bank said a survey of customers showed households were struggling to cope with rising prices that forced them to spend more on food, petrol and heating bills. In a monthly survey of over 2,000 bank account holders, 55% of people said they spent more on household groceries compared to this time last year, a rise of 17 percentage points on December 2016. A year ago half of respondents felt comfortable with the level of inflation. By December 2017 70% were feeling negative about it, the bank said. The survey chimed with a separate survey on consumer confidence by Ipsos Mori that found respondents pessimistic about the outlook for the next year. The polling firm said its confidence index remained at -32 compared to more than +30 in 2014. The weakening outlook is expected to motivate the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate setters to keep the central bank\u2019s base rate at 0.5% when it meets in a fortnight\u2019s time. Some economists have speculated that the strength of the manufacturing sector and record levels of employment would trigger a series of rate rises this year. But the downbeat surveys, combined with figures showing the housing market slowing and the construction industry in recession, will play a significant role in any assessment of the economy by the nine-strong monetary policy committee. Robin Bulloch, managing director of Lloyds Bank, said household budgets were under pressure, with a significant decrease in the proportion of consumers planning to save more in six months\u2019 time. \u201cFamilies with kids are feeling the pressure more than most. Not only has there been a fall in those who plan to save more, but also 45% expect to have to spend more in six months\u2019 time, an increase of 11 percentage points since November,\u201d he said. The CBI said at the weekend that private sector firms reported a slowdown in orders and sales growth in the three months to January. A survey of 629 businesses across the distribution, manufacturing and service sectors showed the balance of firms reporting a rise in output at +9%, compared with +19% in the three months to December 2017. Growth slowed across the board, although it remained above the long-run average in most sectors. Retail volumes declined in the quarter to January, continuing the trend of flat or falling volumes since October 2017. Anna Leach, the CBI\u2019s head of economic intelligence, said there was a slight pick-up in activity forecast by firms for the next three months, but struggling retailers dragged down the recovery. \u201cOur surveys suggest that growth has slowed across the board,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s retailers that are once again bearing the brunt as inflationary pressures continue to squeeze consumer-facing businesses.\u201d The accountancy group Deloitte said its consumer confidence survey was more upbeat, despite remaining at the same level in the three months to December as the three months to the end of September. People were more confident about hanging on to their jobs, but less confident about finding new ones. Ian Stewart, the firm\u2019s chief economist, said that despite a fierce squeeze in spending power last year, consumers went into 2018 \u201cin pretty good spirits\u201d. He said: \u201cWith record levels of job vacancies and an economy that continues to grow we would expect wage growth to edge higher this year as inflation eases. The worst of the squeeze on incomes is probably behind us.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Brexit could leave the UK more vulnerable to energy supply shortages and drive up electricity and gas bills by making energy trading less efficient, a House of Lords committee has warned. Leaving the EU will diminish Britain\u2019s influence on energy rules and cast uncertainty over future European investment in UK energy infrastructure, the peers said in a report. Lord Teverson, the chair of the EU, energy and environment subcommittee, said the impact on energy prices could be significant. \u201cThere will be a divergence and we will not be integrated. What that means is energy trading becomes less efficient and retail prices will go up,\u201d he told the Guardian. Britain and the EU are increasingly interconnected on energy, with the four power cables to the continent expected to be joined by eight more in the coming years. About 12% of the UK\u2019s gas and 5% of its electricity comes from the EU. Despite this, the report said the UK is almost certain to leave the EU\u2019s internal energy market, which is designed to remove trade barriers and harmonise energy trading between member states. Energy companies told the committee they would like to stay in the market. The committee said ministers had failed to spell out the impact of quitting the scheme, and urged them to publish an assessment of the consequences for energy prices. Being outside the EU would also mean the UK \u201cmay be more vulnerable to supply shortages in the event of extreme weather or unplanned generation outages\u201d. Post-Brexit Britain, like Norway and Switzerland, will find its influence on energy rules \u201cseverely constrained\u201d, the peers said. Asked why that mattered, Teverson said: \u201cIt matters because we are part of the EU energy system whether we like it or not.\u201d The report also warned of the unlikely but highly damaging consequences of the UK failing to put in place a new regime to replace Euratom, the EU nuclear cooperation treaty, which the government has decided to leave. \u201cThat could be a real, real problem,\u201d said Teverson.",

Scientists have warned that British power stations may not be able to source nuclear fuel if it cannot be legally transported across borders. The shipment of medical isotopes used in scans and cancer treatment is also said to be jeopardised. European workers on shared research projects, such as experimental fusion reactors, face an equally uncertain future without Euratom\u2019s separate guarantees of freedom of movement. Some critics have claimed that abrupt exit means that by 2025 \u201cyou could be doing your writing by candlelight on a typewriter\u201d as the future of Britain\u2019s nuclear industry hangs in the balance. Calmer voices argue that arranging new rules to ensure safety and govern shipments should not be that hard; just that it is likely to take much longer than the 20 months remaining. But the cost of any short-term chaos is hard to justify given that nobody ever complained about the minor compromises imposed by Euratom on British sovereignty in the first place. Instead, it provides an embarrassing example of the unintended consequences of the prime minister\u2019s hard red line on dealing with the ECJ \u2013 something even a former special adviser to the Brexit secretary has described as dangerously \u201cabsolutist\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",
