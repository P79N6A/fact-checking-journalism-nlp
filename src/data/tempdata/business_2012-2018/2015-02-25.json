      "bodyText": "Andrew Tyrie has been a superb chairman of the Treasury select committee. His waspish interrogation style also set the tone for the parliamentary commission on banking standards, which he also chaired and which delivered strong recommendations on how to inject some much-needed personal accountability into the industry. Not all parliamentary committees have displayed similar financial fluency. In 2007, well before Tyrie\u2019s time, the Treasury committee embarrassed itself with some disgracefully under-informed questioning of a crew of private equity bosses. Tyrie\u2019s committees, by contrast, have been skilful in getting to the bottom of various catastrophes and scandals, from RBS to HBOS to Barclays to the Co-op Bank. But before May\u2019s general election, which may spell the end of Tyrie\u2019s tenure as chairman, he has one last job: call Stephen Green to give evidence on HSBC\u2019s Swiss shambles. There is no need to wait to see if the public accounts committee summons him. Lord Green, chief executive and then chairman of HSBC from 2003 to 2010, was the sorely missed presence at yesterday\u2019s session. Stuart Gulliver, chief executive since 2011, squirmed as he explained why he used to channel his bonus through Panama to prevent his Hong Kong colleagues seeing his bank account. But Gulliver wasn\u2019t a main board director of HSBC between 2005 and 2007, which is the relevant period for the allegations that the Swiss private bank enabled its clients\u2019 tax evasion. Gulliver joined the board of the Swiss subsidiary in late 2007 but the clean-up operation, he assured the MPs, started soon afterwards. Current HSBC chairman Douglas Flint, the other witness, was on HSBC\u2019s board as finance director and duly delivered predictable lines about sharing \u201ccollective responsibility\u201d. But when asked about who was directly responsible for what appears to have been shocking lack of oversight of the Swiss operations, Flint was vague. Chris Mears and Clive Bannister, the heads of the private bank at the time of the scandal, should bear some responsibility, Flint said, but relationship managers in Switzerland should be held most accountable. These were classic \u201cblame the deputies\u201d and plead \u201ccollective responsibilty\u201d lines that have infuriated Tyrie in the past \u2013 and rightly so. His banking standards commission designed rules, subsequently adopted, to make senior bankers responsible for specific functions. The reforms were intended to demolish what Tyrie has called the \u201caccountability firewall\u201d. But, if Tyrie wants to get beyond the firewall in the HSBC Swiss case, the committee will have to hear from the man at the top at the time \u2013 Green. Flint explained that proper due diligence was conducted on Republic and Safra, the two banks that were bought in 1999 to become the core of HSBC\u2019s private banking operation. Control and compliance systems were put in place, he said. But what was not explained was why and how local Swiss managers were then able to depart from HSBC\u2019s \u201cbase line\u201d of good banking and do their own thing. Flint\u2019s inability to give a full account is, perhaps, understandable. As finance director, he was not \u201capproximate\u201d, as he put it, to the Swiss bank; nor, in those days, did he have a role in compliance. But Green, as ultimate group boss and a director of the Swiss bank, was definitely in pole position. Calling Green to give evidence would not be an idle exercise. Tyrie should be intrigued to know if Green would have been more vigorous in demanding good behaviour in Switzerland if he had been operating under the new regime on senior accountability. In other words, would Tyrie\u2019s invention have made a difference? It\u2019s an important question. If Green is to appear, Tyrie needs to move quickly before parliament rises. Get on with it \u2013 and display traditional independence by ignoring the fact that Lord Green is a Tory peer and a general election approaches. AO World cools optimism after last year\u2019s mighty error We believed our own hype. That seems to be gist of AO World\u2019s confession that the \u201cextra publicity\u201d associated with its flotation a year ago generated a boost in sales that turned out to be fleeting.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s all for tonight: Thanks for reading, and commenting, as ever. Goodnight. GW Our politics editor Patrick Wintour sums up HSBC\u2019s appearance before the Treasury committee: HSBC is suffering \u201chorrible reputational damage\u201d as a result of the exposure of the systematic aiding of tax avoidance in its Swiss subsidiary, the bank\u2019s chairman has conceded before MPs. Douglas Flint told the Treasury select committee on Wednesday that he blamed the failings at the Swiss unit on its management, and said secrecy surrounding banking in the country made it difficult for him to have a direct line of sight of what has happening at the bank. Chairman of the bank since the end of 2010, Flint was finance director at the time the Swiss subsidiary was purchased by HSBC. He also insisted he took personal responsibility for decisions for which he had direct accountability.... Full story: HSBC scandal caused horrible damage to bank\u2019s reputation, says chairman Political pressure from the Treasury committee, and beyond, could force HMRC into prosecuting more wealthy people suspected of breaking tax law. That\u2019s according to Fiona Fernie, partner at Pinsent Masons, who says: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to imagine that HMRC can simply shrug off the immense political pressure that they are coming under at the moment to put more high-profile, high net worth cases forward for prosecution.\u201d \u201cThe result of this is that we see a lot more complex, and costly tax cases coming forward for prosecution.\u201d That would surely delight campaigners, and critics who say HMRC are too soft on the rich. But Fernir argues that it could potentially backfire: \u201cThere is a legitimate debate to be had over whether this is the best use of HMRC\u2019s scarce resources. HMRC and the CPS have a good track record of securing convictions for fairly run-of-the mill tax evasion cases, but for complicated cases, even high profile ones like the Harry Rednapp trial, the results seem to be more mixed. HMRC faces Hobson\u2019s choice \u2013 take a pragmatic approach and focus on successfully litigating the lower value cases, or take a moral stance and target higher value cases even where the odds of securing a return for the exchequer are longer.\u201d \u201cIf the defendant makes a sympathetic witness and their financial arrangements are reasonably complex, then prosecutors will have a tough time convincing the jury that deliberate evasion \u2013 which necessarily involves proving dishonesty on the part of the defendant - took place.\u201d Campaigners congregated outside parliament today to call for a fair and effective tax system, as MPs quizzed HSBC\u2019s top bosses. So, what did we learn from that two-hour grilling of Britain\u2019s top tax chiefs? The only big news is that the UK, at long last, has the right to share the data on Swiss bank accounts with other law enforcement agencies. A case of \u2018better late than never\u2019, after five years. HMRC CEO Lin Homer has already dampened expectations, saying she doesn\u2019t think this will lead to a waterfall of new prosecutions, though. The fact it took France so long to waive the restrictions on the data is also a concern, given the importance of tax. Britain needs to avoid a repeat, so HMRC must release the letters it exchanged with French counterparts. MPs also expressed concern that the list leaked by whistleblower Herve Falciani has only led to one successful UK prosecution, out of more than 6,000 names. Perhaps the most important point was made by Jesse Norman MP: how many of the people on this list are non-domiciled for tax purposes? HMRC wasn\u2019t prepared to say -- despite, as Norman said, this might show whether the non-dom rules are being abused. Homer also admitted that she\u2019s concerned by the perception that HMRC is soft on the rich and tough on the poor. Some MPs on the committee, such as Rushanara Ali MP, argued that the public have a point. Last question goes to John Mann -- What would you do if you discovered any parliamentarians were dodging tax? Lin Homer replies that she\u2019d have to check \u201cwhether I had an obligation, or an ability, to refer\u201d them to the parliamentary authorities. But you have my assurance that where there are people in positions of responsibility, we do act, she insists. We have taken a senior barrister to court -- i think he was jailed -- and a magistrate, she adds. John Mann has crunched the numbers, and suggests that the Brits who\u2019ve been using Swiss bank accounts to evade tax have actually made a loss. Either that, or HMRC have failed to get the right amount of tax back. That\u2019s based on the fact that HMRC has recovered around \u00a367,000 each from the 2,000 people who didn\u2019t have a legitimate reason for a Swiss bank account (the \u00a3135m in recovered tax and penalties, divided by 2,000). It actually costs \u00a3100k to set up a secret Swiss account, Mann reckons. Homer replies that she\u2019s very comfortable if people have repaid too much tax -- but Mann\u2019s point is that the amounts recovered could be too low. Can we see the letters from you and the French during the five years while they wouldn\u2019t let you share the Swiss data with other law enforcement agencies and regulators, asks John Mann? Lin Homer says she\u2019ll consider it, and might need to check with the French.... Mann is also unimpressed that HMRC didn\u2019t get a minister involved to break the deadlock. You are hiding behind the fact that the French wouldn\u2019t let you share the data, so there couldn\u2019t be prosecutions, he declared. Not true, Homer insists. We have done a lot with this data. Homer repeats that HMRC doesn\u2019t expect a \u2018waterfall\u2019 of new prosecutions, even though it can now share the date with other agencies. John Mann MP why Dave Hartnett, HMRC\u2019s former head of tax, was allowed to work for HSBC shortly after stepping down from the Revenue? Lin Homer denies that Hartnett has any inside information on HSBC\u2019s Swiss bank, or HMRC\u2019s systems. But surely he knew all about problems with the Swiss bank that have only recently come to light? Homer says not. This is what MPs mean when they talk about HMRC giving the richest an easy ride: The International Consortium of Investigative Journalism is tweeting the key points from this hearing: Rushanara Ali MP is taking HMRC to task about public concerns that the taxman gives preferential treatment to the rich and big businesses. Lin Homer replies that she\u2019s concerned that this is a perception, but it\u2019s totally not true. Really? Ali reminds the committee of an ex-serviceman who was almost made homeless after he got a part-time job, and informed HMRC about the change. So....what proportion of your staff allocation is chasing high net worth individuals who are avoiding or evading, or accused of it? Homer agrees to provide the data, but argues that it\u2019s not just rich people who try to avoid and evade tax. Jesse Norman and Lin Homer then clash, after the HMRC boss declines to say how many of the thousands of UK names on the Swiss tax accounts list are non-doms. It\u2019s not relevant to whether they have paid the right amount of tax, Homer argues, and it might also breach laws on confidentiality. Norman is seriously unimpressed. Leaning forwards to get his point home, the Conservative MP points out that this information could be highly relevant to whether the non-domicile tax system is being abused. But HMRC aren\u2019t keen to release the data (it would be hard to get hold of, apparently), so Andrew Tyrie suggests that they \u201cdrop the committee a line\u201d with more info. Jesse Norman then turns to HSBC\u2019s boss, Stuart Gulliver, who appears to be \u201coperating at the outer limits of aggressive tax avoidance\u201d. He\u2019s been able to enjoy the benefits of living in the this country, his kids go to [private] school here, but he\u2019s still...non-dommed in Hong Kong for potentially 40 years, Norman says. How was this allowed to happen? Lin Homer replies that the rules have been applied accurately. Her job is to get the tax that is due, not what people think is due. Jesse Norman MP returns to the precise status of the Swiss banking data obtained by Herve Falciani. Why is the HMRC copying HSBC and calling it \u201cstolen\u201d? \u201cIt definitely was stolen\u201d, HMRC chief executive Lin Homer replies...... \u201cbut we will use data from whatever source\u201d. We did not pay someone to steal the data, she adds. But you aren\u2019t prepared to be more pro-active, Norman asks? Homer: We would prefer big organisations to give us better data. Norman doesn\u2019t look too impressed [and rightly not \u2013 banks hardly have a good record on this] And why didn\u2019t you tell us that this Swiss data was so gappy and incomplete when you got it, rather than letting expectations build? HMRC argues that it was clear about the state of the data when it came to light. Here\u2019s a video clip of Stuart Gulliver apologising to MPs today, at the start of the hearing: But isn\u2019t the HMRC disappointed by this lack of prosecutions against people who may have used Swiss bank accounts to dodge UK tax? Lin Homer replies that, as a lawyer, she is happy that there is a high bar to getting a successful prosecution. And the HMRC does have stronger civil penalties too, don\u2019t forget. Some twitter reaction: Homer says that much of the evidence leaked from Switzerland is too weak to support successful prosecutions. Onto prosecutions. Or the lack of prosecutions. Andy Love MP presses Lin Homer on why more people with Swiss bank accounts haven\u2019t appeared in the dock. Homer explains that HMRC identified around 150 accounts that could have criminal intent, but only one successful prosecution has followed out of 20 cases. And that might be all we get. Homer tells the committee that she doesn\u2019t think there will be many more successful prosecutions. Why on earth not, Love asks? Even a one-in-20 success rate means that the remaining investigations might yield success? Homes reckons probably not. A total of 1,200 cases were reviewed by our criminal investigations arm, she says, but \u201cthe evidence for prosecution is very high\u201d. MPs are pushing for details for what HMRC did with the Swiss tax account data it was handed. Lin Homer explains that \u00a3120m of unpaid tax and interest was recovered, plus \u00a315m in penalties. And \u201cbroadly speaking\u201d, HMRC has recovered almost all the money, although there are still around 100 cases to go. HMRC say that they made 1000 requests for data on UK taxpayers from the Swiss authorities in the 2014 calendar year, the maximum possible under Britain\u2019s deal with Switzerland (the deal allows 500 per financial year) We\u2019re getting some long answers from HMRC, but not many knock-out blows yet. Lin Homer, HMRC CEO, is explaining that the Swiss data has been tricky to use: Hopefully, the long-awaited breakthrough with the French this week should help..... [or \u201cour friends, the intransigent French\u201d as David Ruffley dubbed them] HMRC has confirmed, with a tweet, that it now has permission to share the Swiss banking data leaked by Herve Falciani with other law enforcement bodies (as covered earlier) The HMRC\u2019s Jennie Granger denies that the UK\u2019s deal with Switzerland would prevent it taking data from a whistleblower, but that people shouldn\u2019t be encouraged to steal data wherever they are. (a reference to the whistleblower-or-thief argument between John Mann MP and HSBC chairman Douglas Flint earlier) Would a simpler tax code lower the amount of tax avoidance and tax evasion, Steve Baker asks? HMRC\u2019s CEO, Lin Homer, replies that for \u201chard-edged\u201d tax evasion, the complexity of the tax system isn\u2019t a major factor. But on the avoidance side, there was \u201cdefinitely a culture in the mid-2000s when banks and other institutions were aggressively creating tax avoidance schemes, and created an environment we weren\u2019t happy with\u201d. Back in Parliament, Steve Baker MP asks HMRC officials about the \u201cnonsense\u201d that parliament is still incentivising people to lower their tax bills through film sponsorship schemes. Edward Troup, tax assurance commissioner at HMRC, says there was a \u201chuge amount of tax avoidance through film tax relief\u201d in the last decade. But the system was reformed in 2007 and 2008, so it\u2019s working as parliament intended. My colleague Juliette Garside, one of the team behind the HSBC investigation, explains what we learned about Stuart Gulliver\u2019s tax affairs today. The key details of Stuart Gulliver\u2019s affairs are beginning to emerge. He claims the full advantages of nondom status. He pays an annual charge - Gulliver says it is \u00a330,000 - in order to keep his offshore assets out of reach of the UK tax office. The remittance charge was introduced by a Labour government in 2008. Those who do not pay but are tax and are resident in the UK must disclose their worldwide assets, like any other British taxpayer. But Gulliver is exempt from this. He pays tax on all his HSBC earnings, but his offshore assets will be taxed in Hong Kong or not at all. Gulliver has succeeded in persuading the revenue that his domicile is Hong Kong, now under Chinese control. This is because he intends to retire there, and has a home there. MPs on the committee expressed surprise that he was able to be granted such a tax perk. Conservative MP Jesse Norman said: \u201cThe anomaly is you could have worked for a UK bank for 40 years, you could have lived in this country for 20 years and you could still be non domicile for tax purposes.\u201d Gulliver was born in Derby, educated at a grammar school in Plymouth and Oxford University, runs Britain\u2019s biggest bank from a UK office, has lived in the UK since 2003, and sent his children to boarding school in the UK. And Gulliver\u2019s own verdict: \u201cThe amount of tax I have paid is the fair and appropriate amount of tax. The absolute lions share of my earnings have been taxed at UK tax rate.\u201d The committee are now hearing from top officials at HMRC. Lin Homer, HMRC\u2019s chief executive, says there is \u201cgood news\u201d to report. On 23rd February, the French authorities have formally confirmed that HMRC can use the leaked HSBC Swiss data with other law enforcement officials and regulators to pursue wider offences those on the list. Tax officials will hold their first meeting next week to plot their next move, Homer says. Until now, the UK were restricted to only using the data for tax purposes only. That has meant that Britain has potentially missed out on wider offences (as they couldn\u2019t \u2018interrogate the information against other data sources) Andrew Tyrie points out that this has taken five whole years. What would have happened if the shoe was on the other foot, and the French wanted our data? We have shared it within weeks, or even days, Homer replies. So, a very quick summary: HSBC has apologised for the \u201cunacceptable\u201d activities of its Swiss banking arm, and admitted that recent revelations have hurt the bank\u2019s reputation. CEO Stuart Gulliver told parliament\u2019s Treasury committee that: \u201cI would like to put on the record an apology from both myself and Douglas for the unacceptable events that took place at our private bank in Switzerland in the mid-2000s. It is an apology we would like to make to you, our customers, our shareholders and the public at large. \u201cIt clearly was unacceptable. We very much regret this, and it has damaged HSBC\u2019s reputation.\u201d Gulliver also defended his non-domicile tax status, insisting that he has not avoided paying any tax in the UK. He conceded that using a Swiss bank account, via a Panamanian company, would look unusual to the public, but vowed that it was to ensure privacy. \u201cIt was purely about privacy from colleagues in Hong Kong and Switzerland. We had a computer system back in the day that allowed everybody to inquire into staff accounts ... I was amongst the highest paid people and I wished to preserve my privacy from colleagues. Nothing more than that.\u201d Gulliver also denied engaging in \u201caggressive\u201d tax avoidance. MPs repeatedly asked Chairman Douglas Flint (a former finance director) who should take the blame for the wrongdoing at its Swiss arm. Flint argued that he, and other board members, shared \u201ccollective responsibility\u201d for the mistakes of the past. But he would not agree to hand back his own bonuses, despite David Ruffley MP calling for \u201catonement\u201d over the Swiss scandal. Flint also revealed that 70% of staff who worked at its Swiss bank at the time of the revelations have left. The rest have been retrained. Gulliver told MPs that he has made sweeping changes to HSBC, and that the bank no longer offer \u201chold-mail\u201d accounts where details were never sent to a customer\u2019s home. Gulliver also denied trying to influence the UK media, and defended putting advertising with the Daily Telegraph \u2018on hold\u2019 after it published negative stories about the bank. We believe in a \u201cfree and vibrant\u201d press, he pledged. And Gulliver, who was paid \u00a37.6m last year, declined to say whether he was a fat cat. But overall, the Treasury committee looked somewhat unimpressed by the performance. Labour\u2019s John Mann, for example, was horrified that Flint described the leak of Swiss data as \u201ctheft\u201d, while other MPs tried repeatedly to get more personal accountability from the pair. And that\u2019s the end of the session. Andrew Tyrie sums up that fixing HSBC appears to be a \u201cwork in progress\u201d. Steve Baker MP asks about the \u00a3250m loan which HSBC gave to the owners of the Telegraph in 2012, as the Guardian reported last week. Gulliver replies that, while he\u2019s restrained about releasing customer details, \u201cwe do not lend any money to the Telegraph at all\u201d. Gulliver denies ever trying to use commercial threats to influence the media - a free press is that very body that makes our ads valuable, he says What about the revelations that you threatened to pull advertising to avoid negative publicity? Gulliver says there was one occasion, after the Telegraph wrote about HSBC\u2019s Jersey bank, that it \u201cpostponed\u201d advertising. He says the ads ran later, and no money was lost. We felt that \u201cNo-one in their right mind\u201d was going to take out a HSBC mortgate or credit card while these stories were running. Steve Baker MP moves onto the issue of the media, and accusations that HSBC used its muscle to influence the Daily Telegraph. How much money does HSBC spend with the Telegraph? Gulliver explains that HSBC spends \u00a331m on advertising, including \u00a34.6m on print adverts. The top five newspapers are (in order) Metro, the Evening Standard, The Telegraph, The Times, and the Daily Mail. Update: he also revealed that in digital advertising, it spends the most with the Guardian, followed by the Independent. Mann asks why Flint hasn\u2019t fired Gulliver. Because he\u2019s doing a very good job. So in that case, why haven\u2019t you resigned yourself? Flint insists that he and Gulliver are fixing the problems at HSBC. John Mann MP asks Flint how he dares to use the term \u201ctheft\u201d to describe the leaked details of its Swiss bank accounts [see earlier post]. Because the data was stolen, Flint replies. But isn\u2019t that a good thing? Flint feels it is not. But it means that we, the public, regulators get to see what you\u2019re not able to see or fix, Mann hits back. Why did HSBC fire a compliance officer, Sue Shelley, after she tried to flag up the problems at the Swiss bank? HSBC denies that Shelley was fired for whistle-blowing, and will write to the committee with further details. Now it\u2019s Alok Sharma MP\u2019s turn to try to get Flint and Gulliver to take full responsibility for its Swiss banking arm. Flint says they take collective responsibility, which includes personal responsibility. But you can\u2019t expect him to take personal responsibility for a large operation that he\u2019s not personally running. Stuart Gulliver is asked if he\u2019s a fat cat. You\u2019d have to define fat cat for me before I can give a \u2018meaningful response\u2019, he replies. Have you ever met anyone who has had their benefits sanctioned? No, he replies. Douglas Flint is asked if he might hand back your own bonus because of the scandal. I\u2019ve not had a bonus since 2010, he replies, and I\u2019ve waived three during my career when I felt I should take personal responsibility. Can bonuses be clawed back? Apparently not. Flint says that the remuneration has \u201clong gone\u201d, and clawback rules didn\u2019t exist at the time. He then reveals that 70% of staff involved with the Swiss private banking arm have now left the company. Shouldn\u2019t we see some \u201catonement\u201d from HSBC over this scandal, asks David Ruffley MP? Douglas Flint says he \u201ctotally\u201d agrees. So who\u2019s going to take personal responsibility? Chris Meares and Clive Bannister, who ran the private banking arm? Flint agrees with the principle that people should take personal responsibility, where appropriate. Meares and Bannister \u201cbear pretty direct responsibility\u201d, he concedes. But the local Swiss management were \u201cmost accountable\u201d. What action did you take as CFO, Mr Flint, when you learned that whistleblower Herv\u00e9 Falciani had been arrested in 2008? What conversions did you have as head of risk? I was given board level responsibility for risk in 2010, Douglas Flint replies. The private bank got more attention during the 2000s, from the audit committee and the management committee. So Chris Meares and Clive Bannister, who ran HSBC\u2019s Private Bank , appeared before us and given targets. Might their bonuses have encourage them to take risks or not operate best practice? Flint argues not -- bonuses were \u2018discretionary\u2019 Flint then repeats that a lot of changes have been made to avoid a repeat of the Swiss scandal.... How could HSBC have been operating proper scrutiny if it allowed cocaine smugglers to launder money through its Swiss bank? (a reference to this, I think) Flint embarks on a long explanation about how leaked account details was stolen during a system upgrade (ironically, to improve controls), so the records aren\u2019t complete or totally accurate (he says). Will Douglas Flint take responsibility for the acquisition of the Swiss bank subsidiary, asks Andy Love. You were the finance director at the time. Flint plays the collective responsibility card, saying that he certainly shares responsibility, as part of the team. I signed off\u2026everyone on this management team signed it off, he replies. Now it\u2019s Andy Love\u2019s MP turn - he grills Douglas Flint about the aggressive tax avoidance schemes which HSBC has been involved with. Two, Eclipse 35 and Goldcrest, have cost UK taxpayers tens of millions of pounds. Would you do them again? Flint admits that \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t do them today\u201d, and indeed stopped such schemes in 2009. Do you understand the deep frustration that customers in this country feel in this country, asks John Thurso. Good citizens in this country who pay tax get hammered by HMRC, but large firms get around it. So, what are you going to do to ensure that the right amount of tax is paid by companies, in the right jurisdiction? One of the fundamental parts of banking is \u201crule of law\u201d, Douglas Flint replies, and that is based on equality before the law. He then adds: I pay all my tax and find it abhorrent that others do not. So are there any other offences you\u2019d like to admit now? The board ask me that regularly, Flint replies. He doesn\u2019t name any other looming problems that aren\u2019t in the public eye. Some early reaction to the hearing (reminder, there\u2019s a live feed here) Onto the revelation in the Guardian that some clients turned up in Switzerland to take large amounts of cash. Wasn\u2019t that a little bit suspicious? Flint struggles for a moment, before arguing that there are \u201clegitimate\u201d reasons for this. Today it\u2019s a \u201cred flag\u201d, though. And why did HSBC operate hold mail accounts? For people who didn\u2019t their bank details to arrive where they live, Gulliver says. HSBC don\u2019t offer them any more. Are they hiding from their spouse, or the taxman? Gulliver replies that such hold-mail accounts weren\u2019t suspicious in Switzerland at the time. Teresa Pearce MP asks Gulliver couldn\u2019t trust HSBC staff not to check his own account fi he banked in Hong Kong. I\u2019m a high-profile employee, he replies. Other clients would be completely secure, of course. My financial affairs are very public now, he adds wryly. But why didn\u2019t HSBC operate proper controls, Tyrie asks. Flint says that the system \u201cworked very well until it didn\u2019t work\u201d, and it\u2019s now being fixed. So are we fixed yet? It\u2019s an ongoing process..... Tyrie takes a broader view now, running through the list of investigations or fines which HSBC faces. Interest rate derivative mis-selling, Libor manipulation, Eurobor manipulation, misselling mortgage-backed securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Forex rigging, Weakness in money laundering controls, credit default swaps, US investigation for rigging precious metals, Various class action lawsuits over the Bernie Madoff fraud..... (I think I missed one). Not a very good list, is it? It\u2019s a terrible list, chairman Flint replies. Although he says HSBC wasn\u2019t fined for Libor rigging. Andrew Tyrie wants to know who is responsible for HSBC buying these overseas operations where banking standards were too low. Who should carry the can? Chairman Douglas Flint argues that you can\u2019t pin the blame for a major acquision on a single person. It\u2019s a joint decision. Tyrie\u2019s not impressed -- how will bankers ever be held to account if no-one takes the blame? Gulliver says that he never discussed the Swiss case with Treasury officials at any of the 56 meeting he had with officials. It may have been raised at \u201ctwo or three\u201d HMRC meetings. But your Swiss bank has bent over backwards to allow tax avoidance and evasion, says Rushanara Ali, so how can you be trusted?. These were Different Times, Gulliver replies. How can the public be expected to trust HSBC, asks Rushanara Ali? Gulliver says HSBC is confident that we have made significant changes to its Swiss private bank. We have cut the number of clients from 30k to 10k. The total assets have been cut by 42%. We\u2019re aiming to only take clients from 38 countries, from 150 before. We want certification from lawyers before taking money from UK non-doms. Douglas Flint say he echoes Gulliver\u2019s apology. Gulliver runs through the changes he\u2019s made as CEO. We used to be run as 88 separate operations before I changed the set up. I have sold 77 businesses, and cut headcount. I hope the British public see that the action steps I gave taken leave HSBC in a better state... Labour MP Rushanara Ali asks Gulliver about his comment this week that large corporations are being held to \u201chigher standards than the military, the church or civil service.\u201d He concedes that this comparison was unfortunate. What about the statement he couldn\u2019t guarantee that the Swiss tax affair would happen again? We have put in place systems, process, controls, to reduce the chance of this happening again to a very low level, he insists. Jesse Norman asks Stuart Gulliver about his non-dom status. Gulliver insists that he has \u201cI have absolutely followed the letter of the domicile law\u201d, including paying that remittance charge. Norman points out that Gulliver has worked in the UK since 2003. How long do you expect to be here? Until I retire from this job, Gulliver replies. So you could work here for 20 years, as a non-domiciled individual? Gulliver says he could: But the important point is that I have paid UK tax on my worldwide HSBC income I have paid the fair and appropriate amount of tax. Onto chairman Douglas Flint, who is asked about reputational damage from these allegations. He insists that HSBC\u2019s pay is among the most transparent in the industry. Important point -- Gulliver says he pays tax on the \u2018remittance\u2019 basis: Gulliver concedes that his arrangements may look unusual and \u201cpuzzling\u201d, but insists that he has paid all the tax he owed in the UK. I have been registered for UK tax since 2003. I have paid UK tax on my HSBC dividends, and capital gains on all shares I have sold, he says. Why Panama? That was simply the nominee entity that our Swiss bank advised, Gulliver says. Explaining his own tax affairs, Gulliver says that he comes from an ordinary background, a state school in Plymouth. But then he joined HSBC, and began working overseas - based in HSBC. He insists there was no tax benefit to the Panamanian company he used for his salary So why do it, asks Tyrie? Simply to give me privacy, Gulliver insists. The system in Hong Kong meant that every employee could see my renumeration. But transparency is a key part of banking - your salary is now disclosed in the company report, Tyrie points out. This is before I joined the board, Gulliver replies. Stuart Gulliver starts by putting on record an apology for the \u201cunacceptable events at our Swiss bank\u201d in the 2000s. He is making it to MPs, customers, shareholders and the public at large. So who is apologising, asks Tyrie? I am personally, Gulliver says. I am responsible for cleaning this up, he adds. Although I wasn\u2019t running the Swiss bank, I was an HSBC employee during this time. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie says there are some quite remarkable revelations to discuss. Starting with Stuart Gulliver - why did he used a company based in Panama, as well as a Swiss bank account, to handle his money? HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver and chairman Douglas Flint have just arrived in Committee Room 8, where the Treasury Committee are assembled for today\u2019s session. MPs in the main chamber of parliament are debating bankers bonuses. My colleague Aisha Gani is covering it in our Politics Live blog: Banking Bonus debate: Politics Live blog The Treasury committee hearing with HSBC, and HMRC, will be broadcast live on the web, here. (right-click to open in a new page) Greg Wise, the actor married to Oscar winner Emma Thompson, has announced that the couple will refuse to pay tax until those who evaded tax through HSBC\u2019s Swiss arm are jailed. Wise told the Evening Standard that: \u201cI want to stop paying tax, until everyone pays tax,\u201d \u201cI have actively loved paying tax, because I am a profound fucking socialist and I believe we are all in it together. But I am disgusted with HMRC. I am disgusted with HSBC. And I\u2019m not paying a penny more until those evil bastards go to prison.\u201d Here\u2019s the story: Emma Thompson and Greg Wise in tax boycott over HSBC scandal The revelations about HSBC\u2019s Swiss banking operations broke on the evening of Sunday, February 8th, and dominated the media for days. The Guardian\u2019s full coverage of the story is online here: HSBC Files This article is a great summary of what\u2019s been uncovered: The HSBC files: what we know so far I\u2019m switching my attention to parliament now, where the two top executives at banking giant HSBC are appearing before the Treasury committee soon. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver and chairman Douglas Flint will be grilled about the revelations that HSBC\u2019s Swiss arm helped wealthy customers avoid taxes and conceal millions of dollars of assets. They\u2019ll also face questions on how the division was able to advise clients on how to circumvent domestic tax authorities, as exposed by leaked files from 2005 to 2007. The committee extended the session from 45 minutes to 2 hours last night, and announced that Gulliver would be attending; originally Flint was due to be alone. Both men can expect tough scrutiny over Swiss tax revelations, and the wider culture at one of the world\u2019s largest banks. Gulliver, who said on Monday that the revelations were a \u201csource of shame and reputational damage\u201d, will probably also be asked why he used a Swiss bank account himself. MPs will also hear from HMRC staff, including CEO Lin Homer. The hearing begins at 2.15pm GMT, so in around half an hour. As City editor Jill Treanor wrote last night: MPs have turned up the heat on HSBC by summoning its boss, Stuart Gulliver, at the last minute to give evidence alongside the group\u2019s chairman. Revelations that Gulliver, brought in as a reforming chief executive of Britain\u2019s biggest bank, had a bank account in Switzerland that was routed through Panama prompted the Treasury select committee to call him in to give evidence. Leaked files covering 2005-2007 show bank chief executive sheltered \u00a35m of his own money at Panamanian company with Swiss HSBC accountRead more Two hours are now scheduled on Wednesday for the MPs to put their questions to the banking bosses, rather than the 45 minutes that had initially been timetabled for the bank\u2019s chairman, Douglas Flint. The two HSBC executives will give evidence to the committee prior to Lin Homer, chief executive of HM Revenue &amp; Customs. She faces questions about why only one person has been prosecuted for avoiding taxes. On Monday while presenting HSBC\u2019s latest results, Gulliver and Flint said they were humbled and shamed by the tax revelations. The Treasury select committee called the hearing after the Guardian and other publications published leaked details of 100,000 bank accounts held by HSBC\u2019s Swiss operation that showed how the bank had helped clients avoid tax and move bricks of cash out of the country. Here\u2019s Jill\u2019s preview: HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver called to answer MPs\u2019 questions on Wednesday Time to recap, before I move away from Greek matters for a few hours. Greece\u2019s prime minister has urged MPs to support the country\u2019s bailout agreement. Alexis Tsipras said the deal was a step forwards, and insisted that the new government must prove it can govern. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has warned that racists and nationalists will triumph if Europe \u2018shoots down\u2019 the new Greek government. He told the Charlie Hebdo magazine that: \u201cThis is what I tell my counterparts: if you think it is in your interest to shoot down progressive governments like ours, just a few days after our election, then you should fear the worst\u201d But concerns are growing in Germany, where finance minister Wolfgang Schauble questioned whether Greece can be trusted. Two senior Berlin lawmakers have warned that Germany must not \u2018throw good money after bad\u2019 at Greece. And in a Greek courtroom, former finance minister George Papaconstantinou faces criminal charges that he removed names from the Lagarde List of suspected tax evaders. Chart time! The Bank of England has unlocked a treasure trove of historic data, as it holds a research conference in London today. Economists have been truffling for tasty highlights: So if economic data is your thing, you\u2019ll love this page: Three centuries of macroeconomic data Over in Dublin, a banking inquiry has heard that Ireland\u2019s Central Bank took more risks with the Republic\u2019s high street banks than its state counterparts in southern European countries like Spain before the financial crash. A reminder that Greece wasn\u2019t the only country to blunder in the good times. Henry McDonald has the story: Professor Gregory O\u2019Connor said that the Irish Central Bank was \u201creally excessively too risky\u201d during the credit boom before the banking system almost totally collapsed in Ireland. The Maynooth University Economist compared the Central Bank in Dublin unfavourably to the likes those in trouble in Southern Europe which were \u201cmore modestly too risky\u201d at the time. He was speaking to the ongoing parliamentary inquiry into how Ireland\u2019s banks had to be rescued by Irish and EU taxpayers with hundreds of billions of euros - a near collapse brought about by excessive lending to fuel a building boom and property buying spree not only in the Republic but across the world. Professor O\u2019Connor said even the Central Bank got caught up in the banking frenzy: \u201cIt took the spirit of the times and really ran with it.\u201d He added that two of Ireland\u2019s insolvent banks should have been left out of the bank guarantee that cost the Republic so much financially, and led to the country\u2019s bailout. Securing the two most insolvent banks with taxpayer\u2019s money was an obvious error and, at a cost of \u20ac35bn, \u201cthey should have been left out\u201d. \u201cThe economy was going into a slump but it could have saved a big chunk of that money.\u201d Alexis Tsipras has told his MPs that Greece took a step forwards at this month\u2019s bailout negotiations, Enikos reports. While things remain tough, his government will be judged by its ability to negotiate and govern, he added, at today\u2019s meeting. A signal to concerned Syriza members not to break ranks. More here Syriza MPs have been gathered in the Athens parliament for over two hours listening to prime minister Alexis Tsipras dissect the deal his government signed last week. Media reports are describing the climate \u201cas anything but jubilant\u201d noting that today marks the 28 the day since Greece (and Europe) got its first far left government (h/t Helena) With dissent within the ruling Syriza party on the rise as the magnitude of the government\u2019s climb-down sinks in, the Euro MP Dimitris Papadimoulis has also waded in, says Helena Smith. Papadimoulis told SKAI TV this morning that the government is going to ride out the storm. The veteran leftist declared: \u201cNone of the government\u2019s senior members are going to pull the rug from under [prime minister Alexis] Tsipras at a time when we have only just begun and the difficulties lie before us.\u201d \u201cThe discussion about the future has already started\u201d, he said, adding that it was \u201conly logical\u201d that when a compromise occurs there are differences of opinion. Papadimoulis, one of Syriza\u2019s big guns, said the government had scored a major coup in opening up a discussion over \u201cthe preposterous\u201d primary surpluses that the previous administration had agreed to with the country\u2019s creditors (3 % in 2015 and 4.5 % in 2016). And he added confidently: \u201cAnd when we succeed, it will be a breath of air [with which] to confront the humanitarian crisis\u201d. If a picture can speak a thousand words it did this morning in the Ta Nea newspaper. Page 12 carried a picture of the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis conferring with Energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis \u201clate at night\u201d in parliament\u2019s cafe. Lafazanis, who heads Syriza\u2019s hard left faction, has openly voiced his displeasure over the government\u2019s plans to press ahead with privatisations [as covered this morning]. Quartz have helpfully deconstructed the letter which Greece\u2019s creditors sent to Athens yesterday: More here. Over in Athens Greece\u2019s labour minister, Panos Skourletis has pledged that the next four months will be a period of \u201cdaily negotiation,\u201d as debt repayment demands loom. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: \u201cWe know that until August we have huge financial requirements,\u201d said Skourletis, referring to the maturing debt that Greece will have to cover by the summer. The labour minister, formerly spokesman of the ruling radical-left Syriza party, told Mega TV that: \u201cThe next four months will be four months of daily negotiation.\u201d Greece has to pay back IMF loans of just under \u20ac2bn by April when it also has to redeem short-term debt of \u20ac4.4bn and \u20ac2.4bn in March and April respectively. Under the aid extension agreement reached on Friday, Athens will receive the last \u20ac7.2bn aid instalment it has yet to draw down from its previous bailout once it has successfully completed a review of that programme (which won\u2019t be until the end of April). \u201cIf the \u20ac7.2bn disbursement is delayed the public sector will have a very serious and possibly unprecedented cash problem,\u201d the leading commentator Ioannis Pretenderis wrote in today\u2019s Ta Nea - with the cynical aside that the disbursement was the one \u201cwe didn\u2019t want because we didn\u2019t need it.\u201d Skourletis also said the left-dominated coalition would confer with the Swiss-based International Labour Organization (ILO) on its plan to re-instate the minimum wage to \u20ac751 (although as part of last week\u2019s deal it pledged to do that \u201cgradually\u201d over the course of the next two years). World stock markets hit a record high this morning, the FT reports, as relief over the Greek bailout talks helped to push shares higher. A solid day\u2019s trading in Asia pushed the FTSE All-World index up to a new high, after the UK FTSE 100, German DAX and US Dow Jones indices all posted record closing highs on Tuesday. However, most European markets are now dipping: The City is also digesting one shocker this morning. Shares in AO World, which sells kitchen appliances over the internet, have plunged by 30% after it issued a profits warning. Full story: AO World shares plummet as appliance retailer issues profits warning Not the best way to mark the first anniversary of AO\u2019s stock market float, and vindication for those who wondered whether a firm flogging fridges over the web could really be worth more than \u00a31.5bn. Investors have paid Germany for the chance to lend it money for five years, for the first time ever. Germany auctioned \u20ac3.3bn of five-year debt at an average yield, or interest rate, of -0.08% this morning, meaning traders paid more than the face value of the debt. Other eurozone bond yields have been hitting record lows again today, continuing a long-running trend. Weak growth prospects, deflation fears, and the imminent launch of the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programme are all driving money into eurozone debt. Europe will hand racists and nationalists a victory if it does not support the new Greek government, finance chief Yanis Varoufakis has warned. Varoufakis made the claim in a new interview with French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. And here it is, headlined \u201cEurope prescribes austerity, as doctors prescribe bleeding.\u201d The article isn\u2019t online, alas. But Reuters has the details: In an interview published on Wednesday - the second edition since the satirical weekly was attacked by Islamist gunmen - the leftist academic says European government\u2019s will suffer if governments like his are \u201casphyxiated.\u201d \u201cThis is what I tell my counterparts: if you think it is in your interest to shoot down progressive governments like ours, just a few days after our election, then you should fear the worst,\u201d he said. Our Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis has written about the new issue, and the magazine\u2019s struggle to recover from last month\u2019s attack: Charlie Hebdo staff ponder bittersweet new success after jihadi terror attack Greece\u2019s finance minister has now weighed in on the privatisation issue, saying that sales that haven\u2019t been completed might be changed. Yanis Varoufakis told the Real FM radio station that: \u201cWe will not change the privatisations that have already been done.\u201d \u201cWith the privatisations that are ongoing, the Greek government can implement the law and change some terms, and also examine the legality.\u201d That follows the energy minister\u2019s claim today that two key ongoing sales will be abandoned.... Alexis Tsipras will soon face his first protest rally since becoming prime minister. Greece\u2019s communist party has called a demonstration on Friday night, against the bailout agreement hammered out late last week. The KKE party accused Tsipras of caving in to the eurozone and trying to deceive the public about the result, declaring: \u201cThe agreement and the list of reforms contain all the anti-popular policies of New Democracy and Pasok parties [the previous government]\u201d. KKE said that citizens who feel disappointed by recent events should assemble in Syntagma Square at 7pm on Friday night (5pm GMT). It also called for the minimum wage to be raised immediately, labour market reforms to be reversed, and more spending on health, education, and other public services. Here\u2019s the statement. Germany\u2019s Rheinische Post newspaper is reporting today that Berlin politicians expect Greece will receive a third bailout this summer, of at least \u20ac20bn. It also predicts that up to 60 government MPs could rebel on Friday, when the Bundestag votes on Greece\u2019s four-month bailout extension. Here\u2019s the full story. Over in Germany, finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has done his bit for international goodwill by questioning whether Greece\u2019s government can be trusted. Discussing the Greek bailout extension on SWR2 radio, Sch\u00e4uble said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy an easy decision for us but neither was it easy for the Greek government because (they) had told the people something completely different in the campaign and afterwards,\u201d \u201cThe question now is whether one can believe the Greek government\u2019s assurances or not. There\u2019s a lot of doubt in Germany, that has to be understood.\u201d (quotes via Reuters) Greece\u2019s energy minister has declared that the privatisation of the country\u2019s largest electricity provider, PPC, and power grid operator ADMIE will not proceed, despite the reforms pledged yesterday. Panagiotis Lafazanis told the Ethnos newspaper that: \u201cThe tender for ADMIE will not go ahead. The companies have not submitted binding bids so it will not be completed. That is also the case with PPC.\u201d Those privatisations were demanded by Greece\u2019s creditors as part of the bailout, and several foreign companies has expressed interest. Yesterday, the Greek government appeared to climb down yesterday over its vow to stop the privatisations. It promised that: \u201cWhere the tender process has been launched the government will respect the process, according to the law.\u201d If binding bids haven\u2019t been filed, maybe Lafazanis is right that Greece can wriggle out. But, these sales were a key source of revenue, so cancelling them creates new budget problems, as well as irking Greece\u2019s creditors..... No fresh record highs in the stock markets this morning, yet anyway. The FTSE 100 is down 2 points, after scaling new heights yesterday, while the German and French indices are flat. More photos from the George Papaconstantinou trial this morning: Greece\u2019s former finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, has gone on trial this morning over charges that he removed the names of three relatives from a list of suspected tax evaders. In the last few minutes, Papaconstantinou has pleaded Not Guilty to charges that he doctored the so-called \u201cLagarde List\u201d. This list, handed to Athens by Christine Lagarde in 2010, contained the names of thousands of Greeks with Swiss bank accounts. Papaconstantinou is charged with criminal counts of doctoring a document and of attempted breach of faith. Papaconstantinou has consistently denied any wrongdoing, saying he is the victim of an attempt to incriminate him. The Lagarde List was obtained by whistleblower Herv\u00e9 Falciani, who took details of thousands of accounts from a Swiss subsidiary of HSBC in 2006-07. The Greek government has been criticised for not promptly investigating the list for potential tax evaders. Instead, it brought charges against the Greek journalist who subsequently published the list in 2013. A group of conservative government MPs have urged Angela Merkel to take a hard line with Athens over its bailout, in another sign of trouble ahead. According to the FAZ newspaper, two senior members of Merkel\u2019s CDU party fear Greece is being treated too leniently. CDU committee head Kurt Lauk, and its secretary general, Wolfgang Steiger, wrote that: \u201cA simple extension of the aid programme without effective terms would mean that we are knowingly throwing further good money after bad.\u201d Reuters has more details. Most of that \u201cgood money\u201d, of course, didn\u2019t hang around in Greece for long before being sent back to the country\u2019s creditors -- such as German banks.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of Greek\u2019s bailout, the world economy, the financial markets and business. The eurozone achieved a breakthrough yesterday, but the hard work is really just beginning. While Greece\u2019s creditors have, somewhat grudgingly, accepted Athens reform plan, prime minister Alexis Tsipras must now handle critics inside his own party who are unhappy that he compromised to get a four-month extension deal. There were murmurings last night that some of Tsipras\u2019s cabinet have concerns about the deal; energy minister Panayiotis Lafazanis isn\u2019t happy that privatisations aren\u2019t being rolled back. And Tsipras\u2019s political opponents are queuing up to put the boot in. PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos, the former deputy PM, railed against the new government last night. He claimed Tsipras is dragging Greece into an avoidable third bailout: \u201cJust as we were poised to exit the memorandum and take up a precautionary credit line with much more comfortable terms, we are stuck with the old memorandum for month and are preparing for a third memorandum from July,\u201d And in Germany too, some MPs are worried that Greece getting more leeway - and fret about what happens in four months time. German MPs vote on Friday. Financial investors remain pleased. Asian stocks markets were pretty calm overnight, after another day of records on Wall Street -- and, finally, in London too yesterday: FTSE 100 hits record high of 6959 after Greece\u2019s reform plan is approved But analysts are worried that both the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank warned yesterday that Greece\u2019s reform plans are too vague. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets puts it this morning: While the agreement is welcome it doesn\u2019t change the fact that Greece still has limited access to funds, and also doesn\u2019t hide the fact that both the IMF and ECB expressed concerns about the level of detail, and indicated that they would insist that Greece would need to do more if it wanted the release of additional bailout monies. So, this crisis ain\u2019t over. But it could be a little calmer, for a while anyway.... I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.",

In 1999, the telecoms and first internet boom was in full swing and phone companies and technology companies made up more than 20% of the index, according to figures from stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown. Now they account for about 7% of the list. BT and Vodafone made up almost 14% of the FTSE between them and were the second and third biggest companies in the country. Both are still in the index but companies that fell out after the dotcom collapse of 2000 included Marconi, which went bust, Colt Telecom and Cable &amp; Wireless. Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe standout difference is the prevalence of telecoms back then. That was shortly before the tech crash that wiped out the likes of Marconi, which was the 10th biggest company in the index in 1999.\u201d The dotcom crash was followed by the financial crisis that started in 2007 and radically reshaped the FTSE 100 again. There were 11 banks in the index in 1999. Now there are five and the sector\u2019s share has shrunk from just over 16% of the list to 13%. The decline represents mergers, some of them to prevent bank collapses, and the damage done to lenders\u2019 share prices during the crisis. The space has been filled by miners, whose presence in the index more than doubled since 1999 when overseas mining companies such as Antofagasta, Fresnillo and Randgold listed their shares in London. When the FTSE hit its last high, miners made up 3% of the FTSE but now the figure has more than doubled, despite the battering mining shares have taken as commodity prices have fallen. While overseas companies have floated in London, UK-based companies have expanded overseas into emerging markets. Affluent Asians used to buy Burberry products when they visited London; now the clothing brand, demerged from another departed name, GUS, makes about 40% of its revenue in Asia. The result is that the FTSE 100 has gone global and become increasingly detached from the UK economy, whose fortunes it was once assumed to reflect. Khalaf said: \u201cThat is increasingly not the case. It\u2019s not a criticism of the FTSE. The marketplace for goods is increasingly global and the place where a company is listed doesn\u2019t necessarily tell you where it does most of its business.\u201d The top echelons of the index have remained more stable as companies such as HSBC and BP have used their financial strength to weather crises including the credit crunch and the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The biggest five companies in 1999 were led by BP, followed by BT, Vodafone, HSBC and Glaxo Wellcome. Now they are led by HSBC and then Royal Dutch Shell, BP, GlaxoSmithKline and British American Tobacco.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Three former top Tesco executives are now running Morrisons after the struggling supermarket business named David Potts as its new boss with a mandate to focus on its core supermarket business. Potts - who spent 38 years at Tesco before quitting in 2011 - will join two former colleagues at the top of the Bradford-based grocer: chairman Andy Higginson and finance director Trevor Strain. The three are not regarded as being tarnished by the current crisis at Tesco and now lead the charge to turn around a business that has been battered by cheaper rivals such as Aldi and Lidl but also failed to take on those at the top end of the market such as Marks &amp; Spencer. His appointment was welcomed by analysts. \u201cWe believe that Potts will bring focus and pace to Morrisons, a business where in tandem with Messrs Higginson and Strain we view the current strategy as being correct but the execution in particular needs correction,\u201d said Clive Black at Shore Capital. Respected in the industry as an experienced nuts-and-bolts retailer, Potts, 57, began his career with Tesco in 1973 and will join his former employer\u2019s arch rival next month. Having started off stacking shelves in his local store, he had various roles at Tesco but left in 2011 when the now discredited regime change took place to replace Sir Terry Leahy. Sir Ken Morrison, who oversaw the transformation of the business from family grocer to national chain, welcomed Potts\u2019 arrival. \u201cI think his appointment is a good thing. Morrisons needs some direction at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my opinion we need to go back to the old standards that have been lost in the last few years. We need leadership. Morrisons has changed for the worse.\u201d Last summer the octogenarian turned up at the grocer\u2019s annual shareholder meeting and publicly attacked Dalton Phillips\u2019 strategy as \u201cbullshit\u201d. Higginson, who has been chairman for barely a month, said: \u201cDavid is the best retailer I have worked with in 25 years in the industry. He will bring to Morrisons a focus on the customer, a track record of delivery, flair, talent, and immense energy to his new role.\u201d He told Retail Week that Potts would have a focus on the core supermarket business to \u201cget some trading momentum back.\u201d Potts will receive \u00a3850,000 in salary and replaces Dalton Philips, who quit last month after a poor Christmas performance. While Potts will join the UK\u2019s fourth largest supermarket chain against the backdrop of a modest improvement in performance, analysts have cautioned the performance was flattered by soft comparisons. His appointment also fuelled speculation of further change at the top of Morrisons, particularly at board level. \u201cWe will naturally ... expect some adjustment to operations, which may involve further evolution of the senior executive team. In this respect we believe that there could be wholesale evolution of the non-executive team that, to our minds, has overseen some dreadful decision-making in time too,\u201d said Black. But there was little expectation of sweeping change to the strategy. At the time of Philips\u2019 resignation, Morrisons announced 10 loss-making stores would close, affecting 409 jobs, but did not step back from Philips\u2019 strategy of making deep cuts in prices and behind-the-scenes efficiency drives. \u201cWe believe this is a good appointment of a strong UK retailer with a proven record,\u201d said analysts at Jefferies. \u201cIt remains to be seen how Mr Potts may reinterpret the group\u2019s strategy. We would speculate at this juncture that revolutionary changes to the current strategic framework are unlikely\u201d. Potts may face questions about the 25-year distribution deal that his predecessor signed with Ocado in 2013 to deliver Morrisons\u2019 goods from the online grocer\u2019s warehouses. The agreement gave Morrisons an internet service for the first time but Philips faced criticism that he had tied Morrisons\u2019 hands with such a long agreement. Analysts have said Potts may look for a way to extricate Morrisons from the arrangement although Ocado has said the contract is watertight. \u201cTo our minds we would be surprised if this model was deemed to be the way forward,\u201d Black said. Analysts are also watching the dividend, amid expectations it could be cut in the wake of Tesco\u2019s move to cancel its final payout to shareholders. Headhunters said Potts had the skill to motivate the 100,000 employees. \u201cAt a time when Morrisons\u2019 employees may be feeling a little unsure, David will motivate and galvanise a large group of people and in turn earn their trust,\u201d said Kate Latham, managing director at headhunters Norman Broadbent.",

      "bodyText": "TSB gained half a million new banking customers in 2014 and said it was in the market for acquisitions as it steps up its challenge to Britain\u2019s big four lenders. The business, a spin-off from bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group, won one in 12 of all new and switching bank accounts over the last year, equating to almost 500,000 new TSB accounts. It is hoping to increase its share of all bank accounts to 6% from 4.3%. Paul Pester, chief executive, would not be drawn on recent speculation that TSB was in talks with Aldermore about a potential takeover of the specialist lender, but confirmed TSB was open to deals. \u201cOur strategy is one of growth. We\u2019re in the market, it\u2019s just a matter of finding the right opportunity. We will look at a raft of things and see what makes sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they are the right assets at the right price and they make sense for our shareholders, then we will look at them.\u201d TSB was spun off from Lloyds last June, and sees itself as a challenger bank to the four biggest players: Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC. The bank has received over \u00a3300m of applications for its mortgage range, which was opened to brokers in January. TSB mortgages had previously not been available through brokers, which account for about 60% of UK mortgage deals. The lender said it expected to provide around \u00a34bn of mortgages through brokers in 2017. Mortgage rates have hit record lows in recent months as banks and building societies compete for market share and the Bank of England holds interest rates at a record low of 0.5%. Pester said the market was competitive: \u201cThere are definitely some great rates out there in the market. This is a great time for customers to be thinking about fixing in for the medium term, and if interest rates rise they\u2019ll be in a great position.\u201d TSB\u2019s pre-tax profits doubled to \u00a3170m in the year to 31 December, boosted by a mortgage book transferred to the lender by Lloyds Banking Group as a part of the spin off, and a favourable pensions settlement with the bank. Lloyds still has a 50% stake in TSB, which it must sell by the end of 2015. Shares in TSB have fallen 10% since their listing on the London Stock Exchange in June and slipped 0.6% to 259.6p on Wednesday. Ian Gordon, banking analysts at Investec, said: \u201cWe continue to believe that TSB offers a \u2018legacy free\u2019 growth opportunity which is likely to prove more resilient than peers in the face of political change ... We regard TSB as a \u2018defensive\u2019, and the time to own such a defensive has, we think, arrived.\u201d TSB said it expected to spend to \u00a3720m in 2015, \u00a330m less than it was previously guiding.",

      "bodyText": "Greg Wise, the actor married to Oscar winner Emma Thompson, has said he and his wife will refuse to pay tax until those involved in the HSBC scandal go to prison. Wise spoke of his disgust with HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) and the bank after the Guardian and other news organisations published leaked details of 100,000 accounts held by HSBC\u2019s Swiss arm which showed how the bank had helped clients to move cash out of the country. \u201cI want to stop paying tax, until everyone pays tax,\u201d Wise told the Evening Standard. \u201cI have actively loved paying tax, because I am a profound fucking socialist and I believe we are all in it together. But I am disgusted with HMRC. I am disgusted with HSBC. And I\u2019m not paying a penny more until those evil bastards go to prison.\u201d Wise, who is rehearsing for Kill Me Now, his first play in 17 years, said Thompson was willing to go along with his act of civil disobedience. \u201cEm\u2019s on board. She agrees. We\u2019re going to get a load of us together. A movement. They can\u2019t send everyone to prison. But we\u2019ll go to prison if necessary. I mean it. It\u2019s going to be like 1848 all over again.\u201d HMRC has come under fire in the HSBC scandal because of a failure to carry out a criminal investigation against the bank, which has its headquarters in the UK. While the agency found more than 1,000 tax evaders among the almost 7,000 UK clients of HSBC Suisse, only one individual has been prosecuted. About \u00a3135m has been recovered in tax, a lower figure than in other European countries. Stuart Gulliver, the head of HSBC, has apologised in writing and again on Monday, when he said the bank\u2019s bosses were shamed and humbled by the scandal. He has been summoned to appear before a Treasury select committee on Wednesday afternoon with the group\u2019s chairman after revelations that he had a bank account in Switzerland that was routed through Panama. Lin Homer, the HMRC chief executive, will also be questioned. Wise, a Labour supporter, expressed disappointment at the party as the country heads for a general election in May. \u201cI\u2019m in absolute despair at all of them,\u201d he said. \u201cI liked Tony before he made his mistakes. I cannot forgive him and the party, and the country. I was one of the 2 million out there, marching. Made fuck-all difference. There is no such thing as democracy.\u201d Wise said injustice made him more angry than anything. \u201cWhether it\u2019s someone being hassled in the street to HSBC getting away with this. I\u2019m the least violent man you\u2019ve ever met, but I will plough into fights in the street to stop someone being set upon. Days afterwards I\u2019m a mess because I hate violence. But I cannot see injustice.\u201d He added: \u201cYes, I\u2019ve got my basic north London leftwing woolly ideas about what\u2019s going on. [Companies like] HSBC haven\u2019t even been slapped on the wrist [because of this] beautiful grey area between avoidance and evasion. It\u2019s iniquitous. We need to do something \u2013 come on!\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The federal court has dismissed a case against Pfizer Australia which claimed the pharmaceutical giant misused its market power and engaged in anti-competitive conduct in the way it supplied one of its blockbuster drugs to pharmacists. In January 2012 Pfizer began offering heavy discounts and rebates to pharmacists for its brand-name statin, Lipitor, on the condition the pharmacy also buy a minimum 12 months\u2019 supply of Pfizer\u2019s cheaper generic version of the same drug. Pfizer was set to lose its patent protection for Lipitor in May 2012, which meant from that date other companies would be allowed to produce and sell their own cheaper versions of the cholesterol-lowering drug. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) alleged that in offering heavy discounts just before losing its patent over Lipitor, Pfizer had aimed to deter or prevent competitors entering the market. The commission also alleged Pfizer had engaged in anti-competitive conduct. But on Wednesday Justice Geoffrey Flick dismissed the case, saying there was not enough evidence to prove the claims. He found while Pfizer had taken advantage of its market power by engaging in the alleged conduct, this power was no longer substantial at the time the offers to pharmacists were made. The commission was now carefully considering the judgment, its chairman, Rod Sims said. \u201cThe ACCC brought this case because it raised important public interest issues regarding the conduct of a patent holder nearing the expiry of that patent and what constitutes permissible competitive conduct,\u201d he said. A Pfizer Australia spokeswoman said the company had always maintained its behaviour was appropriate and met high ethical standards. \u201cDuring the court\u2019s considerations we have continued our work with clinicians and pharmacists, who prescribe and dispense Pfizer medicines to patients every day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will maintain this strong focus, in the interests of improved patient health outcomes.\u201d For the decade to 2013, Lipitor was the highest-selling prescription drug under the government\u2019s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, costing taxpayers $7bn. Statins are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world. A spokesman for the Consumers Health Forum, Mark Metherell, said while he was not in a position to challenge the court finding, the organisation was concerned arrangements between drug companies and pharmacists were affecting the prices consumers paid for medicines. \u201cThe extraordinary complexity of the pharmaceutical pricing system means that nobody really knows what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is very little public knowledge of pricing of these drugs, and many of these drugs are much cheaper globally than what Australians are paying.\u201d A leaked draft of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement this week contained provisions proposed by the US that would further protect the monopoly pharmaceutical companies hold over drugs, and delay cheaper versions from entering the market, the Medical Journal of Australia reported.
