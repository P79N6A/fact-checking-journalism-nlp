Earlier this year the G20 group of nations began a radical programme to reform the tax treatment of multinational corporations in order to curb what world leaders unanimously agreed was a problem threatening both developed and developing economies around the world. Among the areas where tax experts from the OECD have promised action is in relation to companies that borrow aggressively, depressing their tax bills. Tasked by the G20 to come up with new rules by 2015, the OECD experts have also pledged to look at multinational groups artificially shifting business costs \u2014 including interest costs \u2014 across borders so as to play off one tax regime against the other.

    "webTitle": "New Bank of England deputy warns banks over Help to Buy scheme", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The incoming deputy governor of the Bank of England has warned banks the way they grant mortgages to customers with small deposits would be closely monitored but insisted the UK was not in the grip of a housing bubble. Sir Jon Cunliffe, who replaces Paul Tucker next month, told the Treasury select committeeon Monday that \"a very firm eye\" would be kept on lenders using the Help to Buy scheme, which is intended to make it easier for customers with only a 5% deposit to get a mortgage. Amid signs of rising house prices, he said the increase was taking place from a low base and a variation in prices around the UK. \"That doesn't to me look as if there is a bubble,\" he said. He added: \"Is it something that needs to be watched very carefully? Yes. And does the UK have a history of housing booms? Most certainly. Is it something which would need to be dealt with if it posed a risk to financial stability? Yes. But I think it is too early to say we are entering into a bubble.\" Data from the Office for National Statistics shows London house prices rose 9.7% year-on-year in July while in England as a whole they increased by 5.4%. Cunliffe appeared before MPs amid the on-going debate about the impact of the \u00a312bn government guaranteed lending scheme. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the chief executive of bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group, which was one the first banks to sign up to Help to Buy (HTB), said broader reforms to the market were needed. \"It is important that planning permits, building authorisations and social housing projects are [liberalised] so that the increase in [mortgage] transactions does not lead to a substantial increase in house prices,\" he told the Financial Times. The scheme could be focused outside London and the south-east where house prices are rising quickly. In the rest of the UK, Horta-Os\u00f3rio added, \"you have nothing close to a housing bubble\". Ratings agency Moody's shared that view, saying: \"Without a commensurate increase in the housing supply, HTB risks contributing to the creation of a housing bubble, particularly in areas with limited housing stock and high demand, such as Greater London.\" Moody'sexpects banks to be able to charge higher rates on mortgages where customers had deposits of 20% or less, although part of this would be negated by the fee the banks must pay for the guarantees. But ministers have lined up to defend this second stage of Help to Buy \u2013 the first was aimed at new-build homes \u2013 and the EY Item Club of forecasters dismissed fears of a housing bubble as \"hysteria\". The Treasury has used data from the Council for Mortgage Lenders to justify the scheme. CML data shows the median loan-to-value ratio for first time buyers was 95% for most of the 1980s and 1990s. The boss of another bailed-out bank \u2013 UK Asset Resolution which runs the mortgages of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley \u2013 also discussed the possibility of rising house prices in an interview with the Times. Richard Banks said a rise in house prices could help customers with loans larger than the value of their of their homes. \"If house prices go up outside London, it is a good thing for us as quite a few of our customers are trapped by their high loan-to-values,\" said Banks. UKAR has a \u00a342bn loan from the government which it repays when mortgages are paid back or customers move their mortgages to another provider. Banks said this taxpayer loan might be paid back faster if house prices rise. \"If higher house prices mean sufficient customers are able to and choose to remortgage with another mortgage provider, it may facilitate UKAR being able to pay off the government loan more quickly,\" Banks added.",

      "body": "<p>The incoming deputy governor of the Bank of England has warned banks the way they grant mortgages to customers with small deposits would be closely monitored but insisted the UK was not in the grip of a housing bubble.</p> <p>Sir Jon Cunliffe, who replaces Paul Tucker next month, told the Treasury select committeeon Monday that \"a very firm eye\" would be kept on lenders using the Help to Buy scheme, which is intended to make it easier for customers with only a 5% deposit to get a mortgage.</p> <p>Amid signs of rising house prices, he said the increase was taking place from a low base and a variation in prices around the UK. \"That doesn't to me look as if there is a bubble,\" he said.</p> <p>He added: \"Is it something that needs to be watched very carefully? Yes. And does the UK have a history of housing booms? Most certainly. Is it something which would need to be dealt with if it posed a risk to financial stability? Yes. But I think it is too early to say we are entering into a bubble.\"</p> <p>Data from the Office for National Statistics shows London house prices rose 9.7% year-on-year in July while in England as a whole they increased by 5.4%.</p> <p>Cunliffe appeared before MPs amid the on-going debate about the impact of the \u00a312bn government guaranteed lending scheme. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, the chief executive of bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group, which was one the first banks to sign up to Help to Buy (HTB), said broader reforms to the market were needed.</p> <p>\"It is important that planning permits, building authorisations and social housing projects are [liberalised] so that the increase in [mortgage] transactions does not lead to a substantial increase in house prices,\" he <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c4fcd202-327a-11e3-91d2-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=intl\" title=\"\">told the Financial Times</a>. The scheme could be focused outside London and the south-east where house prices are rising quickly. In the rest of the UK, Horta-Os\u00f3rio added, \"you have nothing close to a housing bubble\".</p> <p>Ratings agency Moody's shared that view, saying: \"Without a commensurate increase in the housing supply, HTB risks contributing to the creation of a housing bubble, particularly in areas with limited housing stock and high demand, such as Greater London.\"</p> <p>Moody'sexpects banks to be able to charge higher rates on mortgages where customers had deposits of 20% or less, although part of this would be negated by the fee the banks must pay for the guarantees.</p> <p>But ministers have lined up to defend this second stage of Help to Buy \u2013 the first was aimed at new-build homes \u2013 and the EY Item Club of forecasters dismissed fears of a housing bubble as \"hysteria\".</p> <p>The Treasury has used data from the Council for Mortgage Lenders to justify the scheme. CML data shows the median loan-to-value ratio for first time buyers was 95% for most of the 1980s and 1990s.</p> <p>The boss of another bailed-out bank \u2013 UK Asset Resolution which runs the mortgages of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley \u2013 also discussed the possibility of rising house prices in an interview with the Times. Richard Banks said a rise in house prices could help customers with loans larger than the value of their of their homes. \"If house prices go up outside London, it is a good thing for us as quite a few of our customers are trapped by their high loan-to-values,\" said Banks.</p> <p>UKAR has a \u00a342bn loan from the government which it repays when mortgages are paid back or customers move their mortgages to another provider.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of thousands of small investors could make a profit of more than \u00a3300 on Royal Mail stock on Tuesday morning following a further surge in the company's shares on their second day of trading. Around 350,000 shareholders who bought their stakes through a government website \u2013 out of a total of 690,000 retail investors \u2013 receive their share certificates on Tuesday, allowing them to cash in on the float's instant success. The shares, which the government sold for 330p on Friday morning, closed at 475p on Monday night \u2013 20p higher than at the end of trading on Friday. The 44% jump in the launch share price means that 227 shares bought from the government for \u00a3749.10 \u2013 the allocation for every retail investor \u2013 are now worth \u00a31,078. Danny Cox, of stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said he expected Tuesday's trading activity to be as busy as Friday, when more than 100m shares were traded in the first hour. David Jones, chief market strategist at spread betting firm IG Index, said: \"We're expecting a similar level of excitement as in the first hour on Friday.\" Those who bought shares directly from the government will have to pay \u00a317.50 to sell their shares online. People who bought through a broker could sell the shares for a fee as low as \u00a312. Jones said many of the buyers are wealthy individuals who failed to buy any Royal Mail shares after the government decided to block applications from anyone who ordered more than \u00a310,000 worth of shares. \"The most active [buyers] are high net worth clients who missed out on the allocations they wanted,\" he said. Until now the shares could only be bought and sold via stockbrokers. The company will be fully listed on the London Stock Exchange at 8am on Tuesday triggering \"unconditional dealing\" \u2013 allowing anyone to buy and sell. About 40 people applied for shares worth \u00a31m or more. City investors, including pension funds and hedge funds, have also been big buyers of the stock after 500 of the 800 institutions that applied for shares failed to get any following overwhelming demand. The proportion available to institutions was reduced from 70% to 67% to make slightly more stock available to the public. The government said 90% of the shares sold to the City have gone to \"responsible institutional investors\" such as pension funds. Investors include Threadneedle, Fidelity, Blackrock and Standard Life. The remaining 10% went to hedge funds, including Lansdowne Partners. The Guardian understands that 13.5% of the company was bought by foreign investors, including the sovereign wealth funds of Kuwait, Singapore and Norway. Private investors may be extra keen to sell their shares before the result of a strike ballot of postal workers due on Wednesday afternoon. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said it is \"almost certain\" that its 115,000 members will vote for industrial action. A nationwide strike, the first since 2009, could be held as soon as 23 October. It comes despite 150,000 postal workers making paper profits of more than \u00a3900 from the \u00a32,200 of shares they were granted for free as part of the privatisation. Billy Hayes, general secretary of the CWU, said: \"Shares will make no scintilla of difference to postal workers who are far more concerned about their jobs. We expect our members will vote to protect their terms and conditions. It's more important than ever to get protections for job security and terms and conditions under privatisation. CWU won't stand idly by; whoever owns the company will have to deal with us and the workforce.\" The union will hold a mass meeting outside Royal Mail's Mount Pleasant sorting office in central London on Tuesday morning to coincide with the start of full trading in the company's shares on the Stock Exchange. Brokers said the threatened strike action \u2013 which could lead to days of disruption in the run up to Christmas \u2013 has already been factored into Royal Mail's share price. The attraction of a 6% dividend yield could also persuade retail investors to hold on to their shares rather than sell them, despite a note from analysts at Canaccord Genuity arguing that the shares should be priced at 599p. The soaring share price, which values Royal Mail at \u00a34.7bn compared with the government's maximum \u00a33.3bn valuation, has fuelled accusations that the government sold off the 500-year-old company too cheaply. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said it showed the privatisation was a \"fire sale of a great British institution\". Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said the government had \"massively shortchanged\" taxpayers by significantly undervaluing the institution. If the government had sold the shares at 450p, rather than 330p, it would have made an extra \u00a3600m for the taxpayer on top of the \u00a31.7bn it made from the 52% stake in Royal Mail. The government's pricing of Royal Mail will be investigated by both the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, and the public accounts committee.",

    "webTitle": "Nobel prize in economics won by Fama, Hansen and Shiller - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And as Eugene Fama, Robert Shiller and Lars Peter Hansen get used to their new-found status as Nobel laureates, I'm going to wrap up here. A reminder that highlights of today's award of the Sveriges Riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel starts here. Here is the official statement of why it was awarded to Fama, Hansen and Shiller for their work on asset price theory. An explainer, with key charts is here. Reaction to this year' s prize starts here, including some expert comments on how Fama's work on efficient markets ties in with Shiller's work on irrational exuberance. There's a radio interview with Shiller here, in which he warns of the dangers of market bubbles..... ....and a video interview with Hansen here. And finally, highlights of this afternoon's news conference at Chicago University to recognise Fama and Hansen begin here. And that's all from me. My US colleagues will be tracking the latest twists and turns in America in this liveblog: Obama and Biden to meet leaders of Congress at White House \u2013 live updates Eurozone crisis-watchers should keep an eye on Luxembourg tonight, where eurogroup finance ministers should hold a press conference tonight. It's rumoured to start soon, which suggests they've rattled through the agenda. I'll be back tomorrow. Cheers all. GW Meanwhile back in the UK, Sir Jon Cunliffe, who starts next month as deputy governor of the Bank of England has been answering questions about the rising chorus of house price bubble commentary: My colleague Katie Allen reports: Asked by the cross-party Treasury Committee if he agreed with commentators talking about a housing bubble, Cunliffe told his appointment hearing: \u201cI am not sure I\u2019d agree that we are entering into a housing bubble. I\u2019d agree that house prices have risen pretty quickly this year and also that expectations of future house prices have risen but it is coming from a relatively low base and compared to some historic measures housing activity is still not back to levels we saw before the crisis. House prices to income ratios are probably where they were about ten years ago. So the picture emerging is of prices starting to rise, some sense that people are expecting prices to rise but we are still coming back from a relatively low base and of course a very patchy picture... because there is quite a dispersion across the country.\u201d Worth remembering that the newly Nobel'd Robert Shiller warned this afternoon that housing markets are naturally bubbly (see here). And with a nod of appreciation to their graduate students, and a final question which the microphones didn't catch, that's the end of Fama and Hansen's news conference. Another question, asking about how asset price volatility fits into the efficient markets theory. Does it disprove it? Fama replies that it was natural that there was high volatility during the financial crisis. There's always high volatility in bad times, that's exactly what you'd expect in an efficient market. I though that was a great experiment in validating the efficient markets theory, says Fama, with tongue slightly in cheek, adding: I was the only one in the world who saw it that way, though. This gets Hansen chuckling.... Fama jokes that he can give some strong views on the US shutdown in private, though. Fama and Hansen deftly avoid being lured into answering what they might say to their graduate students about issues such as the US shutdown, as it's not on their course. Next question, did you think about winning the Nobel economics prize when you were starting your career? Eugene Fama replies that \"as a young economist I thought about however am I going to feed my family, because we had a very large family\". Lars Peter Hansen adds that he was more worried about whether he'd get academic tenure. What are your plans for the rest of the day? Fama and Hansen joke that they'd been planning to attend an economics seminar shortly, but that plan may have had been derailed by the win. The problem is you can't make plans any more, jokes Fama. \"Your life is gone\". Both men were already awake when the news came through from Stockholm. Fama explained he was up early to prepare to teach a regular class, while Hansen was up to walk the family dog and meet his personal trainer. Fama and Hansen are taking questions now Hanson, who also gets a rousing round of applause, pays tribute to senior colleagues who helped him develop his theories. They taught him that \"economics is meant to be serious, and meant to be critical...If there's a Chicago School today, that's a big part of it\". Another Chicago senior academic is introducing Lars Peter Hansen, saying his work has bridged the gap between economic models and economic data. Hansen's also been a role model to many others in Chicago, he explains. Very warm applause for Eugene Fama as he takes the stand. He's crediting the collaboration and camaraderie at the Chicago University for helping him develop his theories such as the efficient market hypotheses. It's a great place to work with fine colleagues, he says. Fama adds that he's spent a grant total of 55 years at Chicago. This wins even more enthusiastic applause. Oh hang on, Fama says, it's only 54 Cue slightly more subdued applause.... Appparently Eugene Fama taught a class as usual this morning, hours after being awarded the Sveriges Riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel. Fama and Hansen join 87 other Nobel Prize winners to be affiliated with Chicago University. Their success today means eight Nobel winners will be working at the faculty, including six in economics. Heads-up. A press conference is underway in Chicago to recognise Eugene Fama and Lars Peter Hansen's achievement in winning the economics prize today. It's being streamed here. And there are development in Washington. News is breaking that president Obama will meet with leaders from the Senate and the House at 3pm Eastern time, or 8pm BST. Another opportunity to talk about raising the debt ceiling and passing a budget for 2014..... In a display of efficiency, or irrationality,(or neither), Europe's stock markets managed to shrug off their fears over the US government shutdown. The FTSE 100 closed 20 points higher, up 0.3%, followed by Spain's IBEX (+0.28), Italy's FTSE MIB (+0.19%), France's CAC (very slightly up) and Germany's DAX (very slightly down). Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said investors are still hoping to see progress in Washington soon: The City's traders have become increasingly accustomed to delayed trains, slow running undergrounds and increasingly miserable weather, and judging by the market\u2019s reaction this morning we can also add US political indecision to the list. Plucky lot, our City types... Lars Peter Hansen has spoken about how \"very fortunate, very lucky\" to have won a share of the Nobel prize, paying tribute to his family, mentors, students and colleagues. In an video interview released by the University of Chicago, he speaks about the models he develops to understand the financial markets and the importance of economics in understanding how the world works: Robert Shiller gave an interesting interview to the BBC this afternoon, in which he explained why he examined irrational behaviour in the markets: When I was younger, the whole idea of a bubble was considered nonsense among academics. People had the idea that they didn't exist. Shiller added that there are still \"bubbly markets\" today, citing the stock market and property markets as key areas of concern. And on the US debt ceiling deadlock, he blamed the strong conflict between Liberal and Conservative factions in Congress. Here's the interview. Economics professor Brad DeLong, of University of California, Berkeley, makes an important point regarding the Nobel economics award -- there's a big difference between an efficient market and a good one. Or, as DeLong more elegantly puts it on his blog: There are two big questions: Suppose you had some kind of societal calculating mechanism to produce co-state variables for assets, enterprises, and extra resources in various states of the world in order to aid in decentralized social planning, and you fed that calculating mechanism up-to-date information on tastes, technologies, the distribution of wealth, and the social welfare function consistent with that distribution of wealth. Would the values such a societal calculating mechanism would come up with if it were efficient be close to the values produced by our financial markets? Answer: NO! If the market efficient in the sense that it is very hard to beat? Answer: YES! You can beat the market--consistently attain surplus over-and-above what you would get from a simple buy-and-hold portfolio calibrated to your risk tolerance--only to the extent that you (a) have different liquidity needs than the market, (b) have a different time preference slope than the market, or (c ) know more than the market in the sense of having better information either about fundamentals or about future market psychology than the investment-weighted average of others' opinions that are the market's prices. Of the three prize recipients, Shiller understands both (1) and (2). It's not clear to me Fama and Hansen do\u2026 A reminder for new readers that the Nobel committee produced a handy six-page guide to today's Economics Sciences prize. It begins: There is no way to predict whether the price of stocks and bonds will go up or down over the next few days or weeks. But it is quite possible to foresee the broad course of the prices of these assets over longer time periods, such as, the next three to five years. These findings, which may seem both surprising and contradictory, were made and analyzed by this year\u2019s Laureates, Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller Trendspotting in asset markets Looking back at the Nobel economics Prize: A former winner \u2013 Robert Solow of MIT \u2013 is also touched that the award is shared between the pioneer of efficient markets, Eugene Fama, and the standard bearer of irrational exuberance theories, Robert Shiller. But like Tim Harford earlier this afternoon, Solow can see how the Sveriges Riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel deserved to be split between Fama, Shiller and Hansen. Solow told Bloomberg that this year's winners are a \"very interesting collection\", and reflects the importance of work into how markets operate : Fama is the founder of the efficient market theory and Shiller at least is one of the critics of it. It\u2019s like giving a prize to the Yankees and the Red Sox It was just an indication that what they were interested in was all those that had contributed to the modern theory of finance at both ends of the spectrum. The US dollar is also sliding in value, as traders reduce their exposure ahed of the debt ceiling of 17 October The dollar has lost half a cent against sterling, pushing the pound over $1.60, and also half a cent against the euro, which has risen to $1.359. There's a slight irony in three Americans being recognised for their prowess in economic science, given the events of the last fortnight. It's now almost two weeks since the country's federal government partially shut down because Congress couldn't pass a budget for the new fiscal year. And the US is still on track to hit its debt ceiling limit of $16.7trn in three days time. With neither issue resolved, shares fell on Wall Street in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped 73 points, or 0.5%, to 15163. Most investors still believe a deal will be reached in time -- because the alternative, a US default, is too alarming to really contemplate. But the US economy is already suffering from the shutdown, and the long-term trust in its debt can hardly be improved: Mike Ingram of BGC Partners explains: Firstly there can be little doubt that the ceiling-related government shutdown is inflicting real damage on the US economy. The US public sector accounts for almost 20% of GDP and the current shuttering is estimated to reduce US growth by 0.25% per week. The pain is cumulative and is already showing signs of spilling into the private sector. The forecasts for Q4 growth in the US \u2013 always looking a might too punchy in my view \u2013 will have a big fat red pen through them. Company earnings are immediately vulnerable. Secondly the current debt impasse undoubtedly has longer-term implications for the US economy and beyond. Even when \u2013 presumably within the next three days \u2013 a deal is struck to avoid a technical US default, there is nothing even remotely resembling a long-term settlement on the US budget on the table. Reminder: I rounded up some of the latest analyst comments earlier today. Incidentally, there's no trade in US government debt today, because it's Columbus Day, so we can't see how short-term Treasury bills are reacting to the failure to agree a deal over the weekend. Over on Slate, Matthew Yglesias also points to the novelty of Fama and Shiller being recognised in the same year: The Nobel(ish) Prize in economics was awarded today jointly to three well-known economists\u2014Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen, and Robert Shiller\u2014all of whom have been widely discussed as potential Nobelists but who I think few of us would have imagined sharing the prize. Still, Yglesias also sees the logic in recognising these pioneers of financial market pricing, even if Fama's work showed there was no pattern to short-term price moves and Shiller examined the trends and influences behind long-term moves. The lines of research from Fama, Hansen, and Shiller are all rather different but they're all groundbreaking empirical investigations of the same basic issue\u2014what happens with financial market prices and why. One curious aspect of today's decision is that Eugene Fama and Robert Shiller haven't always seen eye to eye over markets' ability to value assets correctly. While Fama pioneered the notion of efficient markets, Shiller was in the frontline of economists warning about irrational investor behaviour (famously in the run-up to the dot-com crash, and before the sub-prime crisis), As undercover economist Tim Harford puts it rather deliciously this afternoon: Prof Fama showed that markets were efficient; Prof Shiller showed that they were not. But while the efficient markets theory has taken some hefty kickings over the year, it's still one of the most influencial economics theories of recent decades. And Fama's detailed work also undermined the notion that investors should pay top dollar for stockpicking wizardry. As Harford puts it: In the light of the financial crisis, the contribution of Prof Shiller to economic thought is obvious. Prof Fama\u2019s is more subtle: if more investors had taken efficient market theory seriously, they would have been highly suspicious of subprime assets that were somehow rated as very safe yet yielded high returns. Any follower of Eugene Fama would have smelled a rat. Why the efficient markets hypothesis merited a Nobel Here's Associated Press's take: Americans Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller won the Nobel prize for economics on Monday for developing methods to study trends in stock, bond and housing markets. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that through their separate research, the three had laid the foundation of the current understanding of asset prices and changed the way people invest. While it's hard to predict whether stock or bond prices will go up or down in the short term, it's possible to foresee movements over periods of three years or longer, the academy said. \"These findings, which might seem surprising and contradictory, were made and analyzed by this year's laureates,\" the academy said. Fama, 74, and Hansen, 60, are associated with the University of Chicago. Shiller, 67, is a professor at Yale University. Shiller, an economist famous for having warned against bubbles in technology stocks and housing, said he reacted with disbelief when he got the call from the academy early Monday. \"People told me they thought I might win. I discounted it. Probably hundreds have been told that,\" he said to The Associated Press. Shiller is known for developing the Case-Shiller index, a leading measure of U.S. residential real estate prices, with Karl Case, a Wellesley College economist. He said he believes finance is a structure for society, which if regulated properly is \"at the core of our civilization.\" \"It seems to some people it's selfish and money-grubbing. It doesn't really have to be that way. The financial crisis we've been through is traumatic, but we're learning from it,\" Shiller said. For example, he said many students from other countries are able to study in the United States because of financial aid made possible by financial investments. He also said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau established as a result of the recession is holding finance to higher standards. Starting in the 1960s, Fama and others showed how difficult it is to predict individual stock prices in the short run. His findings revolutionized the practice of investing, leading to the emergence of index funds. Two decades later, Shiller showed that there is more predictability in the long run in stock and bond markets, while Hansen developed a statistical method to test theories of asset pricing. \"These are three very different kinds of people and the thing that unites them all is asset pricing,\" says David Warsh, who tracks academic economists on his Economic Principals blog. The news that Eugene Fama, Robert Shiller and Lars Peter Hansen have scooped the 2013 Economics Sciences award has caused a predictable buzz on Twitter - particularly as it broke at 7am Eastern Time, before many Americans were awake. And last month, Robert Shiller pondered the question of whether finance swallows up too many of our brighter minds: We surely need some people in trading and speculation. But how do we know whether we have too many? To some people, the question is a moral one. Trading against others is regarded as an inherently selfish pursuit, even if it might have indirect societal benefits. But, as economists like to point out, traders and speculators provide a useful service. They sort through information about businesses and (at least some of the time) try to judge their real worth. They are thus helping to allocate society's resources to the best uses \u2013 that is, to the most promising businesses. But these people's activities also impose costs on the rest of us. A 2011 paper by Patrick Bolton, Tano Santos, and Jos\u00e9 Scheinkman [online here] argues that a significant amount of speculation and deal-making is pure rent-seeking. In other words, it is wasteful activity that achieves nothing more than enabling the collection of rents on items that might otherwise be free. More here: Should we worry about 'unproductive' financial sector gobbling up our best? This video interview, conducted last year, shows Robert Shiller explaining his views about improving the world of finance. In it, the Yale professor outlines how finance's true role is in financing useful, valuable projects - be that through public finance or private finance. The most important issue today, Shiller argues, is making sure we have the financial system we need. This will require \"a better financial capitalism, a more advanced financial capitalism\". Finance is just too important to do without, because: Financing any important activity means protecting it for the distant future. This isn't what Shiller has been directly recognised for today, of course. But sharing the Economics Sciences prize should give him a broader platform to push this issue in future. Here's Reuters' factbox on today's Economics sciences prize: Fama, Hansen, and Shiller developed new methods for studying asset prices and used them in their investigations of detailed data on the prices of stocks, bonds and other assets. Their methods have become standard tools in academic research, and their insights provide guidance for the development of theory as well as for professional investment practice In 1968, the Sveriges Riksbank - Sweden's central bank - established the prize in memory of Alfred Nobel. It is not one of the five awards set out in the dynamite tycoon's will. The prize is worth 8 million crowns ($1.25 million). Since 1969, 45 prizes have been awarded to 74 laureates; Ragnar Frisch from Norway and Dutchman Jan Tinbergen were the first. Of the 44 prizes, 22 were given to one laureate only. The oldest laureate in Economic Sciences to date is Leonid Hurwicz, who was 90 when he won the 2007 prize. He is also the oldest Laureate to be awarded a prize in any of the categories. Elinor Ostrom is the only female winner of the Economics prize so far, in 2009. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has published a handy explainer to Fama, Shiller and Hansen's work: It includes a couple of charts to illustrate the theories developed and interpreted by the three men (yup, Elinor Ostrom remains the only female economist to be recognised) First, this chart shows Fama's work establishing that past prices are of very little use in predicting returns over the immediate future. It shows how a typical share prices will fluctuate in a narrow range ahead of an important announcement of a dividend increase, and then rapidly adjust. This second chart is based on Robert Shiller's work, on excessive movements in stock prices. If a asset class shows a high ratio of price relative to dividends in one year, this tends to be followed by a fall in prices relative to dividends over subsequent years: That work shows how returns can follow a predictable pattern in the longer run. Shiller and fellow researchers also showed that this 'predictabilility exists in equities and bond markets. Here's the full piece (pdf): Trendspotting in asset markets Trendspotting in asset markets There is no way to predict the price of stocks and bonds over the next few days or weeks. But it is quite possible to foresee the broad course of these prices over longer periods, such as the next three to five years. These findings, which might seem both surprising and contradictory, were made and analyzed by this year\u2019s Laureates, Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller. Beginning in the 1960s, Eugene Fama and several collaborators demonstrated that stock prices are extremely difficult to predict in the short run, and that new information is very quickly incorporated into prices. These findings not only had a profound impact on subsequent research but also changed market practice. The emergence of so-called index funds in stock markets all over the world is a prominent example. If prices are nearly impossible to predict over days or weeks, then shouldn\u2019t they be even harder to predict over several years? The answer is no, as Robert Shiller discovered in the early 1980s. He found that stock prices fluctuate much more than corporate dividends, and that the ratio of prices to dividends tends to fall when it is high, and to increase when it is low. This pattern holds not only for stocks, but also for bonds and other assets. One approach interprets these findings in terms of the response by rational investors to uncertainty in prices. High future returns are then viewed as compensation for holding risky assets during unusually risky times. Lars Peter Hansen developed a statistical method that is particularly well suited to testing rational theories of asset pricing. Using this method, Hansen and other researchers have found that modifications of these theories go a long way toward explaining asset prices. Another approach focuses on departures from rational investor behavior. So-called behavioral finance takes into account institutional restrictions, such as borrowing limits, which prevent smart investors from trading against any mispricing in the market. The Laureates have laid the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices. It relies in part on fluctuations in risk and risk attitudes, and in part on behavioral biases and market frictions. The Nobel Committee say that all three winners were surprised and pleased to learn they'd picked up this year's award, and particularly happy that they were sharing it with the other two. So to quickly recap, this year's Sveriges Riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel has been handed to three American academics who have all conducted influential work into how assets are valued. Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller were all recognised for improving the forecasting of asset prices. Fama was hailed for his pioneering work into the field, beginning with his work on short-term asset price changes. It showed that there was little predictability in asset price changes in the short-term, suggesting it could be impossible to 'beat the market' in the short term. He also established that new information, such as an increase in a stock's dividend, was quickly absorbed into the asset price. Shiller was recognised for his work on longer-term asset prices, establishing that stock prices fluctuated much more than corporate dividends. That showed how the broad course of asset prices could be predicted over a longer time-frame, and also give insights into how financial markets could 'misprice risk' over the long term. Hansen's contribution was in developing statistical models to show how investors priced risk, in particular a new statistical method created in the early 1980s called the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). And that's the end of the press conference from Stockholm..... Robert Shiller is then asked for his views on the state of the financial world following the 2008 crisis. How can we recover? Shiller politely points out that he's written some books on the subject*, before arguing that we must make the finance world work better: Finance drives modern civilisation...our best activities have to be financed. I want to see finance developed further to help humankind. * -there's a list on the Yale website What does the prize mean to you, professor Shiller? Shiller replies that finance is not just a theory, it has practical impact on everyone's lives, and he's pleased that the asset valuation work has been recognised. Robert Shiller is on the line from the US -- saying that he has \"disbelief\" at the news. Did you think you were in the running? Shiller replies that people had suggested it might happen, but \"there are so many worthy people that no, I didn't expect it\" The trio's work has implications far beyond the academic world, the committee adds. It influenced how financial markets work, leading to investment models such as index-tracking funds. Lars Peter Hansen's breakthrough was to develop \"very powerful statistics models\" to test the models developed by the likes of Shiller and Fama. This helped show how asset price movements can be driven by willingness to take risks. The committee explains how Shiller then developed asset price valuation by looking at predictability over longer horizons. While Fama found that it was very hard to workout how a stock would perform in the short term, Shiller looked at the long-term. Among other breakthroughs, he proved that stock prices moved much more than dividend changes - which is unusual because if markets work well you'd might expect less movement. Shiller's work greatly improved our understanding how investors value assets over a long term (and how they can get carried away with exuberance) Eugene Fama is the \"founding father\" of trend-spotting in markets, the Nobel committee explains, recognising his early work in interpreting short-term moves. Fama also conducted early work in how stock prices adjust to dividend changes -- he showed how markets moved swiftly to recognise the promise of higher payments. The committee are explaining how Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller have all made important work in how assets are priced. Their work has: not only radically changed the views among researchers, and also influenced market practice in many ways. THREE WINNERS: professor Eugene Fama of Chicago, Lars Peter Hansen of Chicago, and Robert Shiller of Yale. This year's prize is about \"predictions\", the committee explains. As usual, the announcement is being given in Swedish first, followed by an English translation.... The live feed's up and running.... The announcement is being streamed live, just click this video stream to see it: As I mentioned earlier in this liveblog, there's the usual speculation about possible winners -- from Yale's Robert Shiller to a couple of Britons known for their work on inequality and poverty -- Sir Tony Atkinson of Nuffield College, Oxford, and Angus Deaton. Here's our full preview: Nobel prize in economics: will financial crisis adjustment theory win the day? It's nearly time for the final award in this season's Nobel Prize announcements -- the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Although not on of the official prizes endowed by Nobel, it's still a major honour, and a chance to recognise important work in the so-called Dismal Science. The announcement should come very soon-- just after 1pm CET, or noon BST. UK chancellor George Osborne leading a ministerial delegation to China this week, pushing for closer business ties with Beijing. Osborne's already announced a new \"super priority\" visa service for top businesspeople, and railed against those who assume that the Chinese economy is some kind of low-tech 'sweat shop' operation, saying: There is a bit of a British attitude which treats China as a sort of sweat shop on the Pearl river. One of the things I am trying to do this week in China is to change British attitudes to China. This is a country that is right at the forefront of medicine and hi-tech and computing and hi-tech engineering. Osborne also revealed that his 10-year old daughter is studying Mandarin, helping the chancellor to pick up a basic grasp of Chinese. The chancellor's also taken London Mayor Boris Johnson with him. The pair also paid a visit to Beijing University's campus to mingle with students, as this video clip shows... One other point on that industrial production data (10.24am) -- the final table from Eurostat also shows Portuguese industrial production actually fell by about a fifth in August (rather than leaping 8.2%) if you do adjust for working day changes and don't adjust for seasonal factors. So perhaps not quite such as knockout performance.... Shares on Wall Street are expected to fall when trading begins in around four hours. The Dow Jones is currently being called down almost 100 points, as New York traders respond to Washington's failure to reach a debt ceiling deal. The analyst team at Monex Capital Markets writes: Financial markets across the globe are watching Washington in the hope that lawmakers can find a way out of the current impasse regarding the debt ceiling. For once, the hyperbole we're seeing used to describe the gravity of failure here does actually stack up and if the US government cannot borrow effectively in the open market then a repeat of the fall-out seen in 2008 does seem inevitable. Wall Street is looking at a bruising start to the week with DOW futures coming close to a triple digit loss from the start. Ahead of the open we're calling the DOW down 96 at 15141, the S&amp;P down 11 at 1692 and in after hours trade the Nikkei is down 60 at 14345. Howard Archer of IHS says the 1.0% rise in eurozone industrial production in August suggests the euro economy continues to grow, modestly: August\u2019s rebound in production following on from news that July\u2019s decline was less than first reported (-1.0%, revised up from -1.5%) supports belief that a modest upturn remains intact in the Eurozone manufacturing sector although it is not finding it easy to develop momentum. This was also evident in the September manufacturing purchasing managers survey which showed overall activity expanding modestly for a third successive month but at a slightly reduced rate compared to August. It looks most likely that industrial production edged up overall across the Eurozone in the third quarter. If industrial production was flat in September, it would result in an essentially flat performance quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter. We suspect that it is most likely that Eurozone industrial production rose modestly in September, and edged up by around 0.1-0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, thereby making a small contribution to likely similar overall Eurozone GDP growth of 0.1-0.2% quarter-on-quarter. A surprisingly decent performance by Portugal helped to push Eurozone industrial production up by 1.0% in August, beating analyst forecasts. The Portuguese economy posted the biggest rise in month-on-month industrial production, up by 8.2% on a seasonally adjusted basis. It was followed by Malta (7.2%) and the Czech Republic (+4.7%). The largest decreases were seen in in Estonia (-3.5%), Sweden (-2.8%) and Latvia (-2.0%). In the wider EU, production rose 0.5% month-on-month, Eurostat also reported. Economists, such as Frederik Ducrozet of Credit Agricole, were particularly impressed by Portugal's performance: Eurostat reported that production of capital goods (heavy-duty equipment and machinery) led the way with a 2.4% increase in August, followed by a 0.9% rise in intermediate goods and 0.8% for durable consumer goods But 14 countries also reported lower industrial production than a year ago, while nine reported an increase. Eurostat said the largest decreases were registered in Sweden (-7.9%), Greece (-7.5%), Ireland (-5.9%) and Italy (-4.6%), and the highest increases in Romania (+6.0%), Slovakia (+4.3%) and the Czech Republic (+4.2%) As a result, industrial production across the eurozone was 2.1% lower than in August 2012, and 1.6% lower in the EU as a whole. This underlines the impact of the eurozone recession (which ended in the second quarter of this year). More details here (pdf) Reuters has more details of Greece's plan to address its funding shortfall by rolling over \u20ac4.5bn of bonds that mature next year (as mentioned at 8.01am): Greece plans to partly plug a funding gap next year by rolling over about \u20ac4.5bn ($6.10 billion) of bonds due next March which the government issued to support banks, its finance minister told a newspaper on Monday. Cut off from bond markets since 2010 after its debt crisis exploded,Greece has been kept afloat by 240 billion euros in loans from the European Union and International Monetary Fund. Athens will be financed until the second half of 2014 when it hopes to tap bond markets again. The IMF and authorities in Athens estimate the country faces a funding gap of nearly \u20ac11bn for 2014-15. The European Commission puts the gap at \u20ac3.8bn for 2014 alone, while the IMF estimates it will be \u20ac4.4bn euros. \"We are thinking of rolling over the bonds issued by the finance ministry ... about \u20ac4.5bn. This means covering a big part of the funding gap,\" Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras told Naftemporiki financial daily in an interview. Athens issued the bonds in 2009 to provide liquidity support for its banks during the global credit crisis. In exchange, the banks issued preferred shares to the government. Asked whether Greek bonds held by euro zone central banks could also be rolled over to help cover the funding gap, Stournaras told the paper this was part of a November 2012 agreement. The European Central Bank and other euro zone central banks hold a nominal \u20ac19bn of Greek bonds, of which 10 billion euros matures in 2014. \"There are Greek bonds held by central banks, which had said they would roll them over but up to now have not done so. If they do not want to implement this because they consider it monetary financing, they must find equivalent measures,\" Stournaras was quoted as saying. Asked whether Greece planned to swap a big chunk of its bailout loans with a 50-year bond to provide additional debt relief, the minister said Athens is working on solutions. International lenders have already agreed they could give Athens further debt relief, likely in the form of lower financing costs or extended repayment of its loans, if it meets fiscal targets this year. \"Greece will ask for debt relief based on the decision by the eurogroup (in November) and there are many ways this can be done,\" Stournaras said. \"There are scenarios on extending these loans to 50 years, we are also working on similar scenarios.\" The clock is ticking (literally) towards noon BST and the announcement of the winner of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. There's the usual mix of obscure and less-obscure names in the mix -- could Yale's Robert Shiller finally win the prize, for his work into financial markets and irrational booms? We'll find out in just over two hours time, on the Nobel Prize website. Observer economics editor, Heather Stewart, reckons that while Shiller is a front runner (again), there are plenty of other candidates: Sir Tony Atkinson, of Nuffield College, Oxford, who has long worked on inequality and income distribution \u2013 seen as increasingly relevant in recent years \u2013 is also frequently mentioned. Inequality has also been a consistent concern of another much-mentioned Brit, Angus Deaton. A more mainstream choice for the judges might be Robert Barro, of Harvard, who is in the mould of classic, free market, anti-big stateeconomics. But those who have been fighting for a revolution in the way economics is taught in schools and universities would like to see the Nobel committee make a choice that reflects the seismic changes of the past five years.... More here: Nobel prize in economics: will financial crisis adjustment theory win the day? The New York Times has alsorounded up some runners and riders: Still, some of the names I\u2019m hearing floated as contenders this year include: Jean Tirole, Bengt Holmstrom, Oliver Hart, Robert Barro, Paul Romer,Avinash Dixit, Angus Deaton, Lars Peter Hansen, William Baumol, Robert Shiller, Richard Thaler, Andrei Shleifer, William Nordhaus, Douglas Diamond, Alan Krueger, David Card, Joshua Angrist, Jerry Hausman and Eugene Fama. Royal Mail shares are hitting new highs this morning, despite the threat of industrial action. Shares in the freshly privatised postal operator hit 475p on the second day of 'conditional trading', and have now settling around 469p - up 3% on Friday's close. That's a 42% increase on the 330p float price, and won't do much to ease fears that it was sold too cheaply (although it's still early days - full trading starts on Tuesday....). Royal Mail also faces the prospect of strikes in the run-up to Christmas, as my colleague Rupert Neate reports: \"It is likely to be an all-out strike first, then rolling strikes in the run up to Christmas,\" a union source told the Guardian. Postal workers push ahead with strike plans over pay and conditions Shares in Peugeot-Citroen have tumbled almost 8% this morning, on a report that that the French carmaker is preparing to raise \u20ac3bn in fresh capital. According to the Wall Street Journal, Chinese partner Dongfeng Motor Corp could take a large stake in the company. The French government could also provide funds, further diluting existing investors - who have rushed to sell this morning: It's now 13 days since the US Federal government began its partial shutdown. Thirteen days in which Capitol Hill has been gridlocked over agreeing a budget for 2014 or an increase to America's debt ceiling. City experts are looking at the situation with barely concealed impatience, given the risk that the US simply run out of borrowing room on Thursday. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities points out that it's Columbus Day in America.... One does have to wonder what Christopher Columbus would have done if he had stumbled upon the shambles on Capitol Hill. Turned his ship around post haste and rushed back to the 'Old World'? This week also brings the holiday of Eid Al-Adha, also known as the Fete de Mouton (Feast of the Sacrifice) across the Moslem world, which seems apt if those fools on the Hill opt to lead us like muttonheads to the slaughter, or will be 'giving thanks', as they are in Canada today, that common sense and responsibility have prevailed over boorish, fanatical and infantile intransigence? Kit Juckes of Societe Generale was also vexed (writing last night): A week ago I wrote that the markets were being complacent in their assumption that a debt ceiling increase would be reached in time. By mid-week nerves were frayed. By Thursday the equity market was in full rally as the two sides appeared on the verge of agreeing a temporary debt ceiling increase. And this evening, negotiations are stalled. We have been led a very un-merry dance and I for one am thoroughly dizzy. We are back to a dearth of US economic data and as the shutdown and standoff persist, the drag on the US economy will increase. Ah well. I want to be long sterling; short gilts vs Europe, and I don't' even begin to know how we are supposed to trade 'risk'. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research reminds us that America has solved bigger challenges in the past: Not a lot to report on the US debt ceiling soap opera. Not surprisingly the President turned down the opportunity to kick the can down the road for 6 weeks as no doubt he feels empowered to hold out for a longer term extension. For some reason this reminded me of the film Apollo 13 \u2013 the crew are having a row when Lovell says \u2018\u2026we are not doing this gentlemen\u2026we are not going to go bouncing off the walls for ten minutes, \u2018cause we\u2019re just going to end up back here with the same problems! Try to figure out how to stay alive!\u2019 Anyhow the debt ceiling will remain the focus for the markets as American politicians try and agree a compromise which would allow them to avoid the most pointless default in the history of borrowing. Jenkins also speculates about the long-term impact of the debacle: The market normally likes to focus on the short term, for obvious reasons, but I thought it might be interesting to consider the potential long term impact of the US debt ceiling soap opera. Whilst a default will probably be avoided, the fact that it has been talked about at all might have introduced a concern in the minds of large holders of Treasuries that previously did not exist. Thus the longer term damage to the US could already have been done. There are many reasons why investors hold Treasuries but undermining them all is the belief that they will be repaid fully and on time. Now because of an arbitrary figure the US politicians may have caused the main holders of Treasuries to rethink this basic belief. After all if you are the Chinese government you may now be asking yourself exactly what options you would have in the event of the US not paying you back in full. Indeed I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if the long term unexpected consequence of the debt ceiling debate is that the Chinese government (and maybe others) conclude that they are overly reliant upon the asset class and thus must wean themselves off Treasuries slowly, over a decent period of time. Thus not harming their holdings overnight but ensuring that Treasuries face competition as the safe haven asset class of choice. Such a move would result in less demand for Treasuries which considering the probability of the US getting a handle on their finances would not be good news for US borrowing costs. All a long way off but it is fun sometimes to step away from the immediate market reaction to wonder what the more long term consequences of actions may be. And Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, points out that the US Treasury might be able to muddle through if a deal isn't reached by Thursday. Amid the absence of US progress and nearing of the debt ceiling date, the IMF/G20 is urging the US to take urgent action highlighting risks to the global recovery. Note, the debt ceiling is the date after which the US likely cannot borrow more, however, it\u2019s not necessarily the date it would default with likely an ability to juggle things for a few days longer. Europe's stock markets are open, and the main indices have all dropped around 0.3%. The FTSE 100 is down 16 points at 6471, led by packaging firm Bunzl (-1.7%, after being downgraded by JP Morgan this morning). A nervous start, but nothing too dramatic as traders ponder the stalemate in Washington... Greece's finance minister has confirmed this morning that his government is pushing to 'roll over' around \u20ac4.5bn of bonds that mature in 2014, in an effort to close its funding gap. These bonds were issued in 2009, to raise capital for Greece's banks. They are due to be repaid in March 2014, but Athens is now keen to postpone repayment, to help address a funding shortfall that could reach \u20ac11bn. Finance minister Yannis Stournaras told the Naftemporiki newspaper that: We are thinking of rolling over the bonds issued by the finance ministry in exchange for preferred shares from banks, about \u20ac4.5bn. This means covering a big part of the funding gap. The plan would help avoid the need for further austerity measures. However, it would also mean Greece's debt pile would be larger than planned, so its international lenders may not be keen. The Kathimerini newspaper says its sources predict the European Commission and European Central Bank will raise 'objections'. Incidentally, Stournaras will brief his fellow finance ministers at today's Eurogroup meeting, but we're not expecting any major decisions to be taken: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. It could be an edgy day in Europe's stock markets, after US politicians again failed to reach a deal to extend America's debt ceiling and reopen the Federal government. There are now just three days to go until October 17, when America is expected to hit its debt limit, and still no deal to increase it. Over the weekend, Barack Obama rejected Republican proposals for a short-term debt limit extension, and on Sunday Senate leaders held meetings in an effort to hammer out a compromise. World finance ministers and governors of central banks piled on the pressure yesterday, warning that the global economic recovery could be stopped in its tracks. As ECB president Mario Draghi put it: If this situation were to last a long time this would be negative, very negative for the US economy and the world economy and could certainly harm the recovery. US shutdown threatens global recovery, bankers warn However, an agreement still hasn't been reached - meaning European stock markets are expected to drop when trading begins. Here's IG forecasts: Ahead of the European open we are calling the FTSE at 6467 -20, DAX 8697 -27, CAC 4213 -6, IBEX 9626 -42 and MIB 18860 -22 Also coming up today, eurozone finance ministers will be gathering for this month's Eurogroup meeting. They'll be discussing progress in Greece, Ireland and Portugal, amid reports that Athens is proposing rolling over some maturing debt to fix its borrowing shortfall in 2014 (more on this shortly). There's not much economic news due today, but we do get eurozone industrial production for August at 10am BST. Also, the winner of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel will be announced today. Not officially a Nobel Prize, of course, but still very prestigious. Perhaps we could give it to whoever manages to raise the US debt ceiling?....",

The pain is cumulative and is already showing signs of spilling into the private sector. The forecasts for Q4 growth in the US \u2013 always looking a might too punchy in my view \u2013 will have a big fat red pen through them. Company earnings are immediately vulnerable.</p> <p>Secondly the current debt impasse undoubtedly has longer-term implications for the US economy and beyond.

He also said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau established as a result of the recession is holding finance to higher standards.</p> <p>Starting in the 1960s, Fama and others showed how difficult it is to predict individual stock prices in the short run.

In other words, it is wasteful activity that achieves nothing more than enabling the collection of rents on items that might otherwise be free.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here:&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/sep/23/brain-drain-unproductive-financial-sector?CMP=twt_gu\">Should we worry about 'unproductive' financial sector gobbling up our best?</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-525be439e4b0daf4692ecf78\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T12:43:50.215Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Video: Robert Shiller on improving the world of finance (from 2012)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2012/may/07/robert-shiller-finance-good-society-video\"                                data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"1740303\"            data-video-name=\"Nobel prizewinner Robert Shiller: 'Finance needs to serve the people' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-389617194\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/poster/2012/5/3/120507robertshiller_6135780.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/5/3/120507robertshiller-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/5/3/120507robertshiller_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120507robertshiller/120507robertshiller.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/5/3/120507robertshiller-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/5/3/120507robertshiller_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>   <p><strong>This video interview, conducted last year, shows&#xa0;Robert Shiller explaining his views about improving the world of finance.</strong></p> <p>In it, the Yale professor outlines how finance's true role is in financing useful, valuable projects - be that through public finance or private finance.</p> <p>The most important issue today, Shiller argues, is making sure we have the financial system we need.

But it is quite possible to foresee the broad course of these prices over longer periods, such as the next three to five years. These findings, which might seem both surprising and contradictory, were made and analyzed by this year\u2019s Laureates, Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller.</p> <p>Beginning in the 1960s,&#xa0;<strong>Eugene Fama</strong>&#xa0;and several collaborators demonstrated that stock prices are extremely difficult to predict in the short run, and that new information is very quickly incorporated into prices. These findings not only had a profound impact on subsequent research but also changed market practice. The emergence of so-called index funds in stock markets all over the world is a prominent example.</p> <p>If prices are nearly impossible to predict over days or weeks, then shouldn\u2019t they be even harder to predict over several years? The answer is no, as&#xa0;<strong>Robert Shiller&#xa0;</strong>discovered in the early 1980s. He found that stock prices fluctuate much more than corporate dividends, and that the ratio of prices to dividends tends to fall when it is high, and to increase when it is low. This pattern holds not only for stocks, but also for bonds and other assets.</p> <p>One approach interprets these findings in terms of the response by rational investors to uncertainty in prices. High future returns are then viewed as compensation for holding risky assets during unusually risky times.<strong>&#xa0;Lars Peter Hansen</strong>&#xa0;developed a statistical method that is particularly well suited to testing rational theories of asset pricing. Using this method, Hansen and other researchers have found that modifications of these theories go a long way toward explaining asset prices.</p> <p>Another approach focuses on departures from rational investor behavior. So-called behavioral finance takes into account institutional restrictions, such as borrowing limits, which prevent smart investors from trading against any mispricing in the market.</p> <p>The Laureates have laid the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices. It relies in part on fluctuations in risk and risk attitudes, and in part on behavioral biases and market frictions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9ee76490-9235-46b5-9e48-ce0e81ce28a6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/14/1381751589793/198df5b6-fdd6-4568-aa4b-c3f41d4fddd5-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"The pictures on screen show from (L-R) the Laureates in Economic Sciences 2013, US trio Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: CLAUDIO BRESCIANI/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-525bd9f0e4b0daf4692ecf71\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T11:49:47.256Z\">12.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Nobel Committee say that all three winners were surprised and pleased to learn they'd picked up this year's award, and particularly happy that they were sharing it with the other two.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-525bd637e4b0931fa88f551a\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T11:47:45.306Z\">12.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Success for Fama, Hansen and Shiller</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>So to quickly recap, this year's&#xa0;Sveriges Riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel has been handed to three American academics who have all conducted influential work into how assets are valued.</strong></p> <p><strong>Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller</strong> were all recognised for improving the forecasting of asset prices.</p> <p>Fama was hailed for his pioneering work into the field, beginning with his work on&#xa0;short-term asset price changes.

Whilst a default will probably be avoided, the fact that it has been talked about at all might have introduced a concern in the minds of large holders of Treasuries that previously did not exist. Thus the longer term damage to the US could already have been done. There are many reasons why investors hold Treasuries but undermining them all is the belief that they will be repaid fully and on time. Now because of an arbitrary figure the US politicians may have caused the main holders of Treasuries to rethink this basic belief. After all if you are the Chinese government you may now be asking yourself exactly what options you would have in the event of the US not paying you back in full. Indeed I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if the long term unexpected consequence of the debt ceiling debate is that the Chinese government (and maybe others) conclude that they are overly reliant upon the asset class and thus must wean themselves off Treasuries slowly, over a decent period of time. Thus not harming their holdings overnight but ensuring that Treasuries face competition as the safe haven asset class of choice. Such a move would result in less demand for Treasuries which considering the probability of the US getting a handle on their finances would not be good news for US borrowing costs.</p> <p>All a long way off but it is fun sometimes to step away from the immediate market reaction to wonder what the more long term consequences of actions may be.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>And Mike&#xa0;</strong><strong>van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets,</strong>&#xa0;points out that the US Treasury might be able to muddle through if a deal isn't reached by Thursday.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Amid the&#xa0;absence of US progress&#xa0;and nearing of the&#xa0;debt ceiling date, the&#xa0;IMF/G20&#xa0;is urging the US to&#xa0;take urgent action&#xa0;highlighting&#xa0;risks to the global recovery.&#xa0;</p> <p>Note, the debt ceiling is the date after which the US likely&#xa0;cannot borrow more, however, it\u2019s not necessarily the date it would default with likely an&#xa0;ability to juggle&#xa0;things for a few days longer.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T08:21:51.869Z\">at 9.21am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-525b98e8e4b036d35b97e40c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T07:10:39.264Z\">8.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Pawelmorski/statuses/389648695278702592\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Bloomberg quote of the day welcome break from usual inspirational stuff &quot;Start the day with a smile and get it over with.&quot; WC Fields</p>&mdash; Pawe\u0142 Morski (@Pawelmorski) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pawelmorski/statuses/389648695278702592\">October 14, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-525b973ce4b0d2382acc069f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T07:08:45.576Z\">8.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Europe's stock markets are open, and the main indices have all dropped around 0.3%</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The FTSE 100 is down 16 points at 6471, led by packaging firm <strong>Bunzl</strong> (-1.7%, after being downgraded by JP Morgan this morning).</p> <p>A nervous start, but nothing too dramatic as traders ponder the stalemate in Washington...</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-525b93a6e4b0d9d00a7cb7f6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-14T07:01:48.259Z\">8.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Greek finance minister explains bond rollover plan</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Greece's finance minister has confirmed this morning that his government is pushing to 'roll over' around \u20ac4.5bn of bonds that mature in 2014, in an effort to close its funding gap</strong>.</p> <p>These bonds were issued in 2009, to raise capital for Greece's banks.

      "bodyText": "The widespread criticism of economists' failure to predict the banking crash was addressed on Monday by the Nobel committee when it awarded the much coveted prize for economics to three academics who try to show how financial markets work. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the prize to Eugene Fama and Lars Peter Hansen of the ultra-conservative Chicago school alongside Robert Shiller, the liberal Yale economist famous for warning of the US sub-prime housing bubble in 2005. Fama and Hansen, two followers of Milton Friedman's free-market theories, said they were surprised to win the annual prize which they agreed would turn their lives upside down. The academy said it was honouring the three prizewinners for their work examining the way markets work. They will share the prize of Skr8m (\u00a3781,782) equally. The academy said the three economists were at the top of their field \"for their empirical analysis of asset prices that greatly improved our understanding of how financial markets work, when they seem to work well and when they seem to work otherwise\". Fama, 74, is notorious in leftwing circles for denying financial bubbles exist and asserting recessions are a largely unexplainable fixture of capitalism that should be allowed to take their course. His research has examined how external factors such as insider trading and government regulation can distort the workings of financial markets. In the years before the crash he joined other disciples of Friedman, including former Federal Reserve boss Alan Greenspan, in defending the efficient-markets hypothesis that underpinned the deregulation of the banking system. In the aftermath of the banking crash, Fama blamed the US government, arguing its policy of loosening laws restricting access to credit was at the heart of the crisis. He said the banking industry acted rationally in response to distorting incentives put in place by an interfering government. The American mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were encouraged to lower the bar to lending, fuelling the sub-prime boom. \"The financial markets were a casualty of the recession, not a cause of it,\" he told the New Yorker in 2010. Fama has recently specialised in producing models that show the way stock markets and other asset markets work. Hansen, 60, is best known for his work modelling how economic actors cope with risk and changing environments. Fama and Hansen join 87 other Nobel Prize winners affiliated with Chicago University. Their success means eight Nobel winners will be working at the faculty, including six in economics. Shiller, 67, has risen to prominence following a career that has seen him adapt free-market theories to take on board concepts of exuberance and irrationality. Unlike Fama, who denies it is possible to measure whether assets are overpriced, Shiller has documented how markets can fall victim to bubbles that become unsustainable. In a video interview with the Guardian last year he said finance was not about making money but making money work for the good of communities. His book Irrational Exuberance, published in 2000, debunked the idea that markets always price assets efficiently, without triggering bubbles. David Blanchflower, an economics professor at the Ivy League university Dartmouth College and a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting committee, said Fama's research was a flawed attempt to show that unencumbered markets worked efficiently. \"At some point the Nobel prize economics committee will start to award economics prizes to people who have actually discovered stuff about the real world rather than a made-up dream world,\" he said. \"A good test in medicine is whether the recipient's research has saved a million lives. In economics it's about writing down clever squiggles on diddles that mostly gets rewarded. Shiller is one of a few exceptions.\" Ray Barrell, an economics professor at Brunel university and a former director at the National Institute of Economic &amp; Social Research, said Fama's research \"has helped us understand financial markets\" and he was less dogmatic in support of free-market theories than many other Chicago University academics. The academy said: \"While it is hard to predict whether stock or bond prices will go up or down in the short term, it is possible to foresee movements over periods of three years or longer. These findings, which might seem surprising and contradictory, were made and analysed by this year's laureates.\" Americans have dominated the economics awards in recent years; the last time there were no US economists among the winners was in 1999. The Nobel committees have now announced all six of the annual awards for 2013. The economics award is not a Nobel prize in the same sense as the medicine, chemistry, physics, literature and peace prizes, which were created by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1895. Sweden's central bank added the economics prize in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel. Lars Peter Hansen In another triumph for Chicago University, Hansen, 60, has been rewarded for his work developing a statistical method to test theories of asset pricing. In 1982 Hansen presented a statistical theory \u2013 called the Generalized Method of Moments \u2013 then used it to test whether historical share prices were consistent with the best known asset-pricing model at the time. He found the methods being used must be rejected because they failed to explain share movements. As a result, Hansen's work helped confirm Shiller's preliminary findings on bubbles and inspired new research. It was described as the \"perfect balance\" between Shiller's inefficient market theory on one side, and Fama's espousal of efficient markets on the other. Eugene Fama Chicago University states that Fama, 74, \"is widely recognized as the father of modern finance\", although that boast is clearly double-edged given the markets' recent performance. His views are considered to be the direct opposite of Shiller's, as they are based on the \"efficient markets hypothesis\". This is the idea that markets incorporate all known information about an asset's value, making it pointless trying to predict which way they will move. On Monday, Fama was preparing to teach his first class as a Nobel laureate. Asked if his students would receive special treatment, he told the Associated Press: \"We'll see, but they're going to get an exam tomorrow anyway. They paid their money; they're going to get the full pill.\" Robert Shiller Shiller, 67, is one of the few economists who can claim to have foreseen both the bursting of the dotcom bubble and the US housing crash.

      "body": "<p>The widespread criticism of economists' failure to predict the banking crash was addressed on Monday by the Nobel committee when it awarded the much coveted prize for economics to three academics who try to show how financial markets work.</p> <p>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the prize to Eugene Fama and Lars Peter Hansen of the ultra-conservative Chicago school alongside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2012/may/07/robert-shiller-finance-good-society-video\" title=\"\">Robert Shiller</a>, the liberal Yale economist famous for warning of the US sub-prime housing bubble in 2005.</p> <p>Fama and Hansen,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/14/looming-us-debt-ceiling-deadline-leaves-markets-edgy\" title=\"\"> two followers of Milton Friedman's free-market theories, said they were surprised to win the annual prize</a> which they agreed would turn their lives upside down.</p> <p>The academy said it was honouring the three prizewinners for their work examining the way markets work. They will share the prize of Skr8m (\u00a3781,782) equally.</p> <p>The academy said the three economists were at the top of their field \"for their empirical analysis of asset prices that greatly improved our understanding of how financial markets work, when they seem to work well and when they seem to work otherwise\".</p> <p>Fama, 74, is notorious in leftwing circles for denying financial bubbles exist and asserting recessions are a largely unexplainable fixture of capitalism that should be allowed to take their course. His research has examined how external factors such as insider trading and government regulation can distort the workings of financial markets.</p> <p>In the years before the crash he joined other disciples of Friedman, including former Federal Reserve boss Alan Greenspan, in defending the efficient-markets hypothesis that underpinned the deregulation of the banking system.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the banking crash, Fama blamed the US government, arguing its policy of loosening laws restricting access to credit was at the heart of the crisis. He said the banking industry acted rationally in response to distorting incentives put in place by an interfering government. The American mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were encouraged to lower the bar to lending, fuelling the sub-prime boom.</p> <p>\"The financial markets were a casualty of the recession, not a cause of it,\" he told the New Yorker in 2010.</p> <p>Fama has recently specialised in producing models that show the way stock markets and other asset markets work.</p> <p>Hansen, 60, is best known for his work modelling how economic actors cope with risk and changing environments.</p> <p>Fama and Hansen join 87 other Nobel Prize winners affiliated with Chicago University. Their success means eight Nobel winners will be working at the faculty, including six in economics.</p> <p>Shiller, 67, has risen to prominence following a career that has seen him adapt free-market theories to take on board concepts of exuberance and irrationality. Unlike Fama, who denies it is possible to measure whether assets are overpriced, Shiller has documented how markets can fall victim to bubbles that become unsustainable.</p> <p>In a video interview with the Guardian last year he said finance was not about making money but making money work for the good of communities. His book Irrational Exuberance, published in 2000, debunked the idea that markets always price assets efficiently, without triggering bubbles.</p> <p>David Blanchflower, an economics professor at the Ivy League university Dartmouth College and a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting committee, said Fama's research was a flawed attempt to show that unencumbered markets worked efficiently.</p> <p>\"At some point the Nobel prize economics committee will start to award economics prizes to people who have actually discovered stuff about the real world rather than a made-up dream world,\" he said.</p> <p>\"A good test in medicine is whether the recipient's research has saved a million lives. In economics it's about writing down clever squiggles on diddles that mostly gets rewarded. Shiller is one of a few exceptions.\"</p> <p>Ray Barrell, an economics professor at Brunel university and a former director at the National Institute of Economic &amp; Social Research, said Fama's research \"has helped us understand financial markets\" and he was less dogmatic in support of free-market theories than many other Chicago University academics.</p> <p>The academy said: \"While it is hard to predict whether stock or bond prices will go up or down in the short term, it is possible to foresee movements over periods of three years or longer. These findings, which might seem surprising and contradictory, were made and analysed by this year's laureates.\"</p> <p>Americans have dominated the economics awards in recent years; the last time there were no US economists among the winners was in 1999.</p> <p>The Nobel committees have now announced all six of the annual awards for 2013.</p> <p>The economics award is not a Nobel prize in the same sense as the medicine, chemistry, physics, literature and peace prizes, which were created by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1895. Sweden's central bank added the economics prize in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel.</p> <h2>Lars Peter Hansen<br></h2> <p>In another triumph for Chicago University, Hansen, 60, has been rewarded for his work developing a statistical method to test theories of asset pricing.</p> <p>In 1982 Hansen presented a statistical theory \u2013 called the Generalized Method of Moments \u2013 then used it to test whether historical share prices were consistent with the best known asset-pricing model at the time. He found the methods being used must be rejected because they failed to explain share movements. As a result, Hansen's work helped confirm Shiller's preliminary findings on bubbles and inspired new research.</p> <p>It was described as the \"perfect balance\" between Shiller's inefficient market theory on one side, and Fama's espousal of efficient markets on the other.</p> <h2>Eugene Fama<br></h2> <p>Chicago University states that Fama, 74, \"is widely recognized as the father of modern finance\", although that boast is clearly double-edged given the markets' recent performance.</p> <p>His views are considered to be the direct opposite of Shiller's, as they are based on the \"efficient markets hypothesis\". This is the idea that markets incorporate all known information about an asset's value, making it pointless trying to predict which way they will move.</p> <p>On Monday, Fama was preparing to teach his first class as a Nobel laureate. Asked if his students would receive special treatment, he told the Associated Press: \"We'll see, but they're going to get an exam tomorrow anyway. They paid their money; they're going to get the full pill.\"</p> <h2>Robert Shiller<br></h2> <p>Shiller, 67, is one of the few economists who can claim to have foreseen both the bursting of the dotcom bubble and the US housing crash.</p> <p>His prescient book Irrational Exuberance was first published in 2000, and he followed it up with a second edition in 2005, which took the then unfashionable view that US housing looked dangerously overvalued.</p> <p>A professor of economics at Yale University, Shiller received his first degree from the Michigan University and his economics PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p> <p>He has given his name \u2013 along with colleague Karl Case \u2013 to the most closely watched housing market indicator in the US, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index.

      "bodyText": "Blame Venetia (or, depending which side of the deal you're on, thank her.) Seven years ago, a farsighted former City worker called Venetia Strangways-Booth decided a rundown street in Clapton, east London, needed a proper cafe, one that served decent pastries and excellent espresso. Back then, Chatsworth Road had a bookie or two, a couple of newsagents, a massage parlour, a grocers and a fried-chicken joint. It took Venetia six months to find a landlord who thought her idea stood the slightest chance of working, and almost as long to find a bank willing to lend her the money. These days, the road boasts a whole bunch of coffee-shops in the stripped wood and upcycled furniture vein, a thriving juice bar, a creperie, a chic deli with a French name, a just-like-mama-makes-'em pizzeria, a bicycle repair shop and a Sunday farmers' market. Oh, and some very attractive side roads in which, according to a Nationwide survey last week, house prices have soared by a record 16% in the past year alone, and doubled over the past decade. So much for the crash: along with Lambeth, Hackney is in the vanguard of London's latest housing boom. This isn't, obviously, all \u2013 or even partly \u2013 down to Venetia, who whether by luck or good judgment simply found herself in the right place at the right time: a symptom, not a cause, of what was always going to happen in Hackney once it had finished happening, a few years earlier, in Islington. But the borough's rocketing property prices seem to have taken even the professionals by surprise. \"And they're showing no signs of stopping,\" says Mahe Georgio, manager of local estate agent Castles, established for 30-odd years on nearby Lower Clapton Road (itself long known, at least in the media, as \"Murder Mile\"). \"I grew up in Hackney and I can tell you it wasn't the place to be then. Not at all. But it really is now.\" People, Georgio says, \"are buying anything that's for sale. A couple of years ago, buyers would turn their noses up at ex-local authority stock \u2013 they wanted period Victorian, or trendy warehouse conversions. Now ex-local sells in days, and for more than the asking price. It's positively sought-after.\" Demand has become so frenzied that, with 400 to 500 clients actively looking for homes in the area and hundreds more having registered an interest, the agency has turned to open days, sealed bids and \"best and final\" offers. \"It's fairer and it avoids bidding wars,\" says Georgio. \"But even as things are, there's no room now for offers below the asking price. And you've got no chance of buying in Hackney unless your finances are already fully sorted, your property is sold and you're ready to go.\" Prices are rising so fast, adds sales negotiator George Athanasi, showing me a smart, newly converted three-bed ground- and lower-ground floor garden flat that Castles has just sold for (wait for it) \u00a3535,000, that \"even the surveyors are getting confused. We get calls: they want to know the recent comparables, whether these prices are real.\" Buyers are now looking, says Georgio, at \"\u00a3200,000 for a one-bed, ex-council flat, and \u00a3300,000 for a one-bed period conversion. Upwards of \u00a3700,000 for a three-bed Victorian terraced; that would have been \u00a3600,000 a year ago, and \u00a3300,000 before Venetia's. And this is Hackney. It's quite shocking, even for us.\" Hackney estate agents are not the only ones in shock. According to that Nationwide survey, the average UK home is currently increasing in value by more than \u00a350 a day; the annual rate of growth is now running at 5% nationally, and 10% in London. The upturn is, it seems, affecting all of the UK's 13 regions, although prices in the south of England are rising faster than elsewhere. In London as a whole, surprising as it may seem, typical property values have now reached 8% above their 2007 peak. Astonishingly, even \"mid-ranking bankers\" \u2013 earning less than \u00a3500,000 \u2013 are now complaining that central London house prices are prohibitive. That's not big news, though, to Rupert des Forges, head of elite agency Knight Frank's Knightsbridge office. He can pinpoint precisely when things started picking up again in the prime parts of central London that he specialises in \u2013 and it was more than four years ago. \"Easter weekend, 2009,\" des Forges says. \"That was the moment. We'd had a fairly torrid seven or eight months after September 2008, when the City went into freefall, but we came back that Easter and the market was flying, and it's been flying ever since. Not 30%-a-year growth like 2006 and 2007. But good, firm, month-on-month growth. \" The mood of the market has changed, des Forges notes, which is probably a good thing: \"Back then, we had houses selling for a million pounds more than they had 12 months earlier. The froth's gone out of it. Volumes are really down; you need much more equity than you did. But people have it. People have the money.\" Prime central London is, plainly, not Hackney: des Forges is showing me a sumptuous residence he modestly describes as a \"best-in-class garden square apartment\" on a classic Knightsbridge square. \"It's a 3,000 sq ft lateral conversion across two 1860s townhouses,\" he says, as we take off our shoes in the hallway. \"Six windows overlooking the square. Building just refurbished to the highest standards; apartment immaculate. You're 400 yards from Harrods, and the same distance from Hyde Park.\" The price is \u00a311.5m. Who has that kind of money? Plenty of people, apparently: this kind of property typically sells in days. And not all foreigners: des Forges reckons a good 50% of his clients are British, a mix of old London money and more recent fortunes. For the rest, Greeks are sharply up (their numbers have tripled since the eurozone crisis began), but Knight Frank has sold central London properties to buyers from 70 different countries over the past 12 months \u2013 about double the pre-crash number. That's part of the explanation why, when it comes to property, prime central London is so different from the rest of country: supply, particularly in the most sought-after areas including Knightsbridge, Belgravia, Mayfair and St James's is, as des Forges puts it, \"pretty much a finite resource\", yet more and more people want to live there. If anything, says Knight Frank's head of residential research, Liam Bailey, the crash has actually strengthened the capital's position as a property exception: after plummeting by as much as 25%, he reckons central London prices have soared by some 60% since March 2009, and are now a good 20% higher than they were before the crash. What the crash has effectively done, in other words, is widen the gap between London and the rest of the country even further. \"The big question in 2009,\" Bailey says, \"was whether London's role as a major global centre had been undermined. The answer is now pretty much established, and it's no. London was always a big business and financial centre, a place where wealthy people want to live and buy property. But the arguments for relocating here are now stronger than ever. It's just in the right place, it has the right assets, it ticks the right boxes. The market here now is incredibly diverse, both in nationalities and business sectors \u2013 it's no longer just financial services driving it. But key to it all is London's connectivity as a global business centre. And as more and more people join the global economy, it doesn't take many of them to want to come here ... \" Most analysts see central London's already sky-high prices moving inexorably higher. \"If London is going to continue to grow as a global city and supply is not increased, then prices will go up,\" Bailey says. \"More demand will mean higher prices.\" So since the estate agents' traditional adage is that whatever direction prices head in prime central London, they will eventually follow \u2013 with varying degrees of lag \u2013 in outer London too, then in the home counties, and finally in the rest of the country, are we heading for yet another bubble? A lot of people seem to think so. The Nationwide figures are, certainly, the latest in a steady stream of news and data showing that the housing market \u2013 our abiding national obsession \u2013 is on the move again. In August, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said prices were rising at their fastest rate since the market peak of November 2006. This month, we learned that more than 560,000 people are now working in estate agencies, the highest number since records began in 1978 (the sector is apparently the fastest-growing part of the national workforce). This week, the Bank of England declared that the number of mortgages approved for homebuyers was at its highest since early 2008; the 62,200-odd house purchase loans given the go ahead in August represented a 30% increase over the same month last year (although still well below the 2007 peak). As the prime minister announces plans to bring forward the start date for the government's controversial \u00a312bn Help to Buy scheme, designed to increase the availability of 95% mortgages, lenders are gearing up for a new goldrush: both NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland have said they will open their branches late to cope with the anticipated extra demand. And according to a report this week by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, the average price of a home in Britain will jump by a quarter in the next five years, hitting a record figure of nearly \u00a3280,000, with average London prices set to surge from from \u00a3395,000 today to \u00a3566,000 in 2018. Bailey is cautious. He is forecasting \"quite slow growth\" in the longer term outside central London, where he says prices have only really been rising since the budget in March. For most people, he notes, \"how much I can pay for a house is a factor of how much I earn, how much can I borrow, what's my deposit. Prices rose before the crash because of access to credit and the availability of debt. They've struggled since, because credit has not been so available.\" But many fear that with mortgage approvals already rising and interest rates set to stay low for some time, Help to Buy \u2013 which enables people to buy a home for up to \u00a3600,000 on a deposit of only 5%, with the government providing a guarantee to the lender of up to 15% of the loan \u2013 could be the spark that ignites another full-blown British housing bubble. David Cameron insists the scheme is necessary to help young people who can afford \"sensible\" mortgages but not 25% deposits get onto the property ladder. But it has been criticised as \"reckless\", \"mad\" and even \"dangerous\" by economists and bodies as varied as the International Monetary Fund, the Institute of Directors, the Adam Smith Institute, the Office for Budget Responsibility and the Treasury select committee. In an apparent attempt to appease the scheme's critics, the chancellor, George Osborne, recently gave the Bank of England a bigger role in ensuring it doesn't drive up prices. Here's the problem, though: after more or less continual annual increases for the past half century or so \u2013 they trebled between 1995 and 2007, and have increased 50-fold since 1970, with the estate agents Savills this year putting the combined value of Britain's housing stock at a staggering \u00a35tn \u2013 house prices in Britain are already far, far too high. According to organisations as reputable as the IMF, the Economist and, most recently, the OECD, even post-crash UK house prices are still more than 30% too high compared with rents, and more than 20% overvalued compared with incomes. There are many reasons for this, a big one being chronic underbuilding. In the 1970s, Britain regularly built 300,000 new homes a year \u2013 over that decade, housebuilding outpaced population growth sixfold, the Economist notes. In the past decade, however, \"only half as many homes have been built as people added\". Right now, we should be building a quarter of a million new homes every year; in 2011 we managed 145,000. That's not all, though. Low interest rates; reckless lending and borrowing that allowed self-certified, 110% and interest-free mortgages; the emergence of what Faisal Islam, in his book The Default Line, terms an infernal \"bubble machine\" in which everyone \u2013 from estate agents to lenders to solicitors to home-owners \u2013 had an interest in prices continuing to rise, have all contributed. However it happened, home ownership in the UK has steadily become confused with wealth acquisition; the roof over our heads is now seen as a kind of \"multifaceted financial instrument\", Islam argues: an investment, a cash-machine, a livelihood for buy-to-let landlords, a supplementary pension (one report suggests the number of over-50s planning to use the equity in the homes to help fund their retirement has doubled to 52% in a year). One of the many effects of this overvaluation, as most 20-somethings and many 30-somethings know, has been to put home ownership \u2013 certainly in southern England \u2013 a long way beyond their reach, unless they band together or rely on an increasingly substantial leg-up from their parents. Which, increasingly, they do: according to Georgio in Hackney, around half the first-time buyers on Castles books will be backed by the bank of mum and dad. Many of the remainder will be relatively high-earning sharers buying jointly. Some will be helped by Help to Buy. But fundamentally, in great swaths of the country, house prices will remain out of all proportion to anything as mundane as salaries. This has happened in my working life: in 1985, fresh out of university, my then partner and I bought a newly converted one-bed flat in Acton for \u00a332,000. We were each earning around \u00a38,000 a year at the time, so needed to borrow twice our combined annual income to do so. Today, similar flats are changing hands at nearer \u00a3300,000 and two would-be buyers of the same age and in the same the jobs we were then would need more like seven times their joint salaries. The crash, in effect, has had zero impact on London property prices, which in relation to earnings are as as high for first-time buyers as they were in 2007. In that context, surely, any kind of house-price inflation \u2013 even the risk of it \u2013 is undesirable. Even the agents see that. \"We never had a US, Spanish or Irish-style crash,\" says Bailey. \"House prices haven't really corrected significantly. Housing in the UK is still overpriced, compared to the fundamentals. What we want is even a little bit of price erosion, taking inflation into account.\" But there are an awful lot of people who would rather that never happens.",

According to that Nationwide survey, the average UK home is currently increasing in value by more than \u00a350 a day; the annual rate of growth is now running at 5% nationally, and 10% in London. The upturn is, it seems, affecting all of the UK's 13 regions, although prices in the south of England are rising faster than elsewhere.</p> <p>In London as a whole, surprising as it may seem, typical property values have now reached 8% above their 2007 peak. Astonishingly, even \"mid-ranking bankers\" \u2013 earning less than \u00a3500,000 \u2013 are now complaining that <a href=\"http://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/152654/mid-ranking-young-bankers-now-priced-out-of-the-property-market/\" title=\"\">central London house prices are prohibitive</a>.</p> <p>That's not big news, though, to Rupert des Forges, head of elite agency <a href=\"http://www.knightfrank.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Knight Frank's</a> Knightsbridge office. He can pinpoint precisely when things started picking up again in the prime parts of central London that he specialises in \u2013 and it was more than four years ago.</p> <p>\"Easter weekend, 2009,\" des Forges says. \"That was the moment. We'd had a fairly torrid seven or eight months after September 2008, when the City went into freefall, but we came back that Easter and the market was flying, and it's been flying ever since. Not 30%-a-year growth like 2006 and 2007. But good, firm, month-on-month growth. \"</p> <p>The mood of the market has changed, des Forges notes, which is probably a good thing: \"Back then, we had houses selling for a million pounds more than they had 12 months earlier. The froth's gone out of it. Volumes are really down; you need much more equity than you did. But people have it. People have the money.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-419936778\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/14/1381763687722/Knightsbridge-London-010.jpg\" alt=\"Knightsbridge, London\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A street in Knightsbridge, London: prime central London property sells in days. Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prime central London is, plainly, not Hackney: des Forges is showing me a sumptuous residence he modestly describes as a \"best-in-class garden square apartment\" on a classic Knightsbridge square. \"It's a 3,000 sq ft lateral conversion across two 1860s townhouses,\" he says, as we take off our shoes in the hallway. \"Six windows overlooking the square. Building just refurbished to the highest standards; apartment immaculate. You're 400 yards from Harrods, and the same distance from Hyde Park.\" The price is \u00a311.5m.</p> <p>Who has that kind of money? Plenty of people, apparently: this kind of property typically sells in days. And not all foreigners: des Forges reckons a good 50% of his clients are British, a mix of old London money and more recent fortunes. For the rest, Greeks are sharply up (their numbers have tripled since the eurozone crisis began), but Knight Frank has sold central London properties to buyers from 70 different countries over the past 12 months \u2013 about double the pre-crash number.</p> <p>That's part of the explanation why, when it comes to property, prime central London is so different from the rest of country: supply, particularly in the most sought-after areas including Knightsbridge, Belgravia, Mayfair and St James's is, as des Forges puts it, \"pretty much a finite resource\", yet more and more people want to live there.</p> <p>If anything, says Knight Frank's head of residential research, Liam Bailey, the crash has actually strengthened the capital's position as a property exception: after plummeting by as much as 25%, he reckons central London prices have soared by some 60% since March 2009, and are now a good 20% higher than they were before the crash. What the crash has effectively done, in other words, is widen the gap between London and the rest of the country even further.</p> <p>\"The big question in 2009,\" Bailey says, \"was whether London's role as a major global centre had been undermined. The answer is now pretty much established, and it's no. London was always a big business and financial centre, a place where wealthy people want to live and buy property. But the arguments for relocating here are now stronger than ever. It's just in the right place, it has the right assets, it ticks the right boxes. The market here now is incredibly diverse, both in nationalities and business sectors \u2013 it's no longer just financial services driving it. But key to it all is London's connectivity as a global business centre. And as more and more people join the global economy, it doesn't take many of them to want to come here ... \"</p> <p>Most analysts see central London's already sky-high prices moving inexorably higher. \"If London is going to continue to grow as a global city and supply is not increased, then prices will go up,\" Bailey says. \"More demand will mean higher prices.\" So since the estate agents' traditional adage is that whatever direction prices head in prime central London, they will eventually follow \u2013 with varying degrees of lag \u2013 in outer London too, then in the home counties, and finally in the rest of the country, are we heading for yet another bubble?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-419936779\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/14/1381763383560/A-quiet-suburban-street-n-010.jpg\" alt=\"A quiet suburban street near Manchester, UK\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A suburban street near Manchester: outside the south east, prices are also predicted to rise.

The Nationwide figures are, certainly, the latest in a steady stream of news and data showing that the housing market \u2013 our abiding national obsession \u2013 is on the move again. In August, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said prices were rising at their fastest rate since the market peak of November 2006.</p> <p>This month, we learned that more than 560,000 people <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/11/record-number-estate-agents-housing-bubble\" title=\"\">are now working in estate agencies</a>, the highest number since records began in 1978 (the sector is apparently the fastest-growing part of the national workforce). This week, the Bank of England declared that the number of mortgages approved for homebuyers was at <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24330611\" title=\"\">its highest since early 2008</a>; the 62,200-odd house purchase loans given the go ahead in August represented a 30% increase over the same month last year (although still well below the 2007 peak).</p> <p>As the prime minister announces plans <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24319583\" title=\"\">to bring forward the start date</a> for the government's controversial <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jul/22/credit-history-help-to-buy-property-buyers\" title=\"\">\u00a312bn Help to Buy scheme</a>, designed to increase the availability of 95% mortgages, lenders are gearing up for a new goldrush: both NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland have said they will open their branches late to cope with the anticipated extra demand.</p> <p>And according to a <a href=\"http://www.cebr.com/reports/house-prices-reach-a-record-high/\" title=\"\">report this week</a> by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, the average price of a home in Britain will jump by a quarter in the next five years, hitting a record figure of nearly \u00a3280,000, with average London prices set to surge from from \u00a3395,000 today to \u00a3566,000 in 2018.</p> <p>Bailey is cautious. He is forecasting \"quite slow growth\" in the longer term outside central London, where he says prices have only really been rising since the budget in March. For most people, he notes, \"how much I can pay for a house is a factor of how much I earn, how much can I borrow, what's my deposit. Prices rose before the crash because of access to credit and the availability of debt. They've struggled since, because credit has not been so available.\"</p> <p>But many fear that with mortgage approvals already rising and interest rates set to stay low for some time, Help to Buy \u2013 which enables people to buy a home for up to \u00a3600,000 on a deposit of only 5%, with the government providing a guarantee to the lender of up to 15% of the loan \u2013 could be the spark that ignites another full-blown British housing bubble.</p> <p>David Cameron insists the scheme is necessary to help young people who can afford \"sensible\" mortgages but not 25% deposits get onto the property ladder. But it has been criticised as \"reckless\", \"mad\" and even \"dangerous\" by <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chancellor-george-osborne-warned-that-mad-help-to-buy-scheme-could-drive-up-house-prices-8728895.html\" title=\"\">economists and bodies as varied as</a> the International Monetary Fund, the Institute of Directors, the Adam Smith Institute, the Office for Budget Responsibility and the Treasury select committee. In an apparent attempt to appease the scheme's critics, the chancellor, George Osborne, recently gave the Bank of England a bigger role in ensuring it doesn't drive up prices.</p> <p>Here's the problem, though: after more or less continual annual increases for the past half century or so \u2013 they trebled between 1995 and 2007, and have increased 50-fold since 1970, with the estate agents Savills this year <a href=\"http://www.savills.co.uk/_news/newsitem.aspx?intSitePageId=0&amp;intNewsSitePageId=144360-0&amp;intNewsMonth=2&amp;intNewsYear=2013\" title=\"\">putting the combined value of Britain's housing stock</a> at a staggering \u00a35tn \u2013 house prices in Britain are already far, far too high.</p> <p>According to organisations as reputable as the IMF, the Economist and, most recently, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/houseprices/10088467/OECD-British-house-prices-are-31-too-high.html\" title=\"\">the OECD</a>, even post-crash UK house prices are still more than 30% too high compared with rents, and more than 20% overvalued compared with incomes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-419936777\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/14/1381761798467/New-detached-house-Rendle-010.jpg\" alt=\"New detached house Rendlesham, Suffolk\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New-build housing: 145,000 new houses were built in 2011, compared with approximately 3000,000 per year in the 1970s. Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are many reasons for this, a big one being chronic underbuilding. In the 1970s, Britain regularly built 300,000 new homes a year \u2013 over that decade, housebuilding outpaced population growth sixfold, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2013/09/house-prices?__utma=157191919.931106877.1381401961.1381401961.1381401961.1&amp;__utmb=157191919.2.10.1381401961&amp;__utmc=157191919&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=157191919.1381401961.1.1.utmcsr=facebook.com|utmccn=%28referral%29|utmcmd=referral|utmcct=/l.php&amp;__utmv=-&amp;__utmk=147560311\" title=\"\">the Economist notes</a>. In the past decade, however, \"only half as many homes have been built as people added\". Right now, we <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2013/sep/18/census-study-depth-housing-crisis\" title=\"\">should be building a quarter of a million new homes every year</a>; in 2011 we managed 145,000.</p> <p>That's not all, though. Low interest rates; reckless lending and borrowing that allowed self-certified, 110% and interest-free mortgages; the emergence of what Faisal Islam, in his book The Default Line, terms an infernal \"bubble machine\" in which everyone \u2013 from estate agents to lenders to solicitors to home-owners \u2013 had an interest in prices continuing to rise, have all contributed.</p> <p>However it happened, home ownership in the UK has steadily become confused with wealth acquisition; the roof over our heads is now seen as a kind of \"multifaceted financial instrument\", Islam argues: an investment, a cash-machine, a livelihood for buy-to-let landlords, a supplementary pension (<a href=\"http://www.ageuk.org.uk/latest-news/half-of-people-over-50-to-sell-homes-for-retirement/\" title=\"\">one report</a> suggests the number of over-50s planning to use the equity in the homes to help fund their retirement has doubled to 52% in a year).</p> <p>One of the many effects of this overvaluation, as most 20-somethings and many 30-somethings know, has been to put home ownership \u2013 certainly in southern England \u2013 a long way beyond their reach, unless they band together or rely on an increasingly substantial leg-up from their parents. Which, increasingly, they do: according to Georgio in Hackney, around half the first-time buyers on Castles books will be backed by the bank of mum and dad. Many of the remainder will be relatively high-earning sharers buying jointly.</p> <p>Some will be helped by Help to Buy. But fundamentally, in great swaths of the country, house prices will remain out of all proportion to anything as mundane as salaries. This has happened in my working life: in 1985, fresh out of university, my then partner and I bought a newly converted one-bed flat in Acton for \u00a332,000. We were each earning around \u00a38,000 a year at the time, so needed to borrow twice our combined annual income to do so. Today, similar flats are changing hands at nearer \u00a3300,000 and two would-be buyers of the same age and in the same the jobs we were then would need more like seven times their joint salaries.</p> <p>The crash, in effect, has had zero impact on London property prices, which in relation to earnings are as as high for first-time buyers as they were in 2007. In that context, surely, any kind of house-price inflation \u2013 even the risk of it \u2013 is undesirable. Even the agents see that. \"We never had a US, Spanish or Irish-style crash,\" says Bailey. \"House prices haven't really corrected significantly. Housing in the UK is still overpriced, compared to the fundamentals. What we want is even a little bit of price erosion, taking inflation into account.\"</p> <p>But there are an awful lot of people who would rather that never happens.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The US Federal Reserve sparked a global \u2013 and now month-long \u2013 guessing game with its decision on 18 September not to \"taper\" its monthly purchases of long-term securities. The Fed does not surprise markets often, and this has been especially true of the Ben Bernanke-led Fed, which has devoted enormous time and effort to better communication, greater transparency, and timely management of expectations. Now that President Barack Obama has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/09/obama-janet-yellen-us-federal-reserve\" title=\"\">nominated Fed vice-chair Janet Yellen to succeed Bernanke in January</a>, there is even greater interest in what lies ahead for the world's most important central bank.</p> <p>Fed officials did not do a great job of managing expectations in the weeks preceding their September policy meeting. Having also struggled to reclaim the narrative thereafter, there is great interest in understanding what led the Fed to act in such an uncharacteristic manner. Nonetheless, the real issue is that the Fed's last-minute change of heart does not significantly alter the main challenge that the highly qualified Yellen will face: persistently weak economic fundamentals and doubts about the continued effectiveness of the Fed's policy tools.</p> <p>Five main arguments for the Fed's decision to postpone the taper have frequently been proposed.

      "bodyText": "The US Federal Reserve sparked a global \u2013 and now month-long \u2013 guessing game with its decision on 18 September not to \"taper\" its monthly purchases of long-term securities. The Fed does not surprise markets often, and this has been especially true of the Ben Bernanke-led Fed, which has devoted enormous time and effort to better communication, greater transparency, and timely management of expectations. Now that President Barack Obama has nominated Fed vice-chair Janet Yellen to succeed Bernanke in January, there is even greater interest in what lies ahead for the world's most important central bank. Fed officials did not do a great job of managing expectations in the weeks preceding their September policy meeting. Having also struggled to reclaim the narrative thereafter, there is great interest in understanding what led the Fed to act in such an uncharacteristic manner. Nonetheless, the real issue is that the Fed's last-minute change of heart does not significantly alter the main challenge that the highly qualified Yellen will face: persistently weak economic fundamentals and doubts about the continued effectiveness of the Fed's policy tools. Five main arguments for the Fed's decision to postpone the taper have frequently been proposed. One view is that the Fed recognised that its specification of policy thresholds (based on the unemployment rate) understated the vulnerability of the US labour market. Another is that officials worried about excessive financial tightening after Bernanke's mention in May of a possible taper, jeopardising the economy's gradual recovery. Moreover, some believe that the Fed considered the possibility of adverse feedback loops associated with the financial dislocations in emerging economies. Others see in the decision to postpone the taper an effort to pre-empt the negative effects on the economy of a possible congressional debacle over government funding and the debt limit. Indeed, the final argument \u2013 in a sense underpinning the others \u2013 is that the Fed became less worried about the potential for collateral economic damage from prolonged reliance on unconventional monetary policy. The first three arguments speak to the Fed's heightened concerns about the economy in general, and about the labour and housing markets in particular. The fourth reflects a desire to insure the economy against congressional dysfunction. And if the Fed feels that the costs and risks of hyper-activism have indeed diminished (the fifth argument), it becomes more comfortable maintaining intense policy experimentation. Most of these arguments \u2013 though not all of them \u2013 have merit. That is the good news. The bad news is that the decision not to taper is unlikely to put either the Fed or the economy in a better place, confronting Yellen with a difficult task when she begins her historic tenure. True, the Fed's use of the classic measure of the unemployment rate as a key policy threshold underestimates the US economy's fragility. Rather than reflecting buoyant job creation, too much of the recent decline in the unemployment rate has been associated with a fall in labour force participation to a level last seen 35 years ago. Long-term joblessness and youth unemployment remain far too high, with skills erosion, reduced mobility, and a growing opportunity gap relative to formal educational attainment risking lasting damage in the aftermath of the Great Recession. The debate about financial conditions is both more heated and more nuanced. While equity and credit markets did rebound from their May-June dislocation, higher interest rates have hit the housing market quite hard, reflected in a sharp fall in the mortgage-refinance index, lower home affordability, and declining purchases. This attests to the extent to which parts of the financial intermediation process remain over-reliant on Fed experimentation, even as small- and medium-size companies still find it difficult to obtain adequate credit at reasonable cost. The less confident the Fed is about the robustness of economic recovery at home, the greater is its interest in minimising external headwinds. Thus, it would be natural for the Fed to worry about slowing economic growth in emerging countries (accentuated in countries such as Brazil and India by the financial volatility that followed the Fed's taper talk in May). Moreover, with extreme political partisanship causing a government shutdown and threatening a debt-ceiling debacle, it would be understandable for the Fed to try to limit the impact of a dysfunctional Congress on consumer demand and business confidence. So what does all this say about the future, including the key issues facing Yellen? In assessing how far it is from meeting its mandate, the Fed may be better served by shifting from unemployment to employment thresholds (for example, the employment/population ratio). It could even start moving to a more holistic operational measure (say, nominal GDP), together with indicators of the economy's structural fragility. The Fed would have an opportunity to discuss this in its upcoming policy meetings in the context of evolutionary steps to strengthen its forward policy guidance, an initiative that Yellen has spearheaded. It may also need to think more about support for small and medium-size firms that continue to face structurally clogged credit pipes. Unfortunately, with what is happening in Washington, none of this would significantly heighten the durable impact of Fed policy on economic growth and employment. Other policymaking entities \u2013 particularly those with potentially more effective tools to help the economy reach escape velocity \u2013 need to act but are hampered by legislative impasse. Meanwhile, continued and prolonged reliance on unconventional policies does involve unusual uncertainty and potential costs. With Yellen's nomination to succeed Bernanke, one Fed guessing game has ended.

      "bodyText": "The latest Credit Suisse world wealth report released last week showed that, like last year, Australians are the richest people in the world. With a median wealth of US$219,500 per adult, we sit comfortably ahead of Luxembourg on $182,768. The US, with a median adult wealth of only $44,911, doesn't even make the top 25. When counting by average wealth per adult, we drop to second behind Switzerland. Significantly, however, Australia is more equitable than most wealthy nations. Of the top 50 biggest economies, only Belgium, Italy and Finland have less of a difference between median and average wealth. The greater the difference, the more wealth is in the hands of the richest. Australia's average wealth is just 1.8 times our median wealth; by contrast the UK's is 2.2 times greater, while the US is second worst out of the top 50, at 6.7 times. Russia is the most inequitable, with its average wealth 12.6 times that of the median wealth. So shall we break out the champers and order some extra large lobsters for Christmas lunch this year? Well maybe ... but maybe not. The Credit Suisse report is always a nice one for Australia. We certainly punch above our weight when it comes to wealth. But a closer inspection reveals that part of our high national wealth is due to the very measure used \u2013 US dollars. The large appreciation in the value of Australia's currency in the past three years has meant that converting Australian dollars into US currency sees Australia rather wealthier than we once were in US dollars. The average wealth of Australian adults is just over US$402,000, but if we measure it using a constant exchange rate that negates the improvement in our currency in the past three years, the average is only $328,900. That we are this wealthy should not come as too much of a surprise. We have long been near the top of charts when comparing GDP per capita using US dollars.

If we account for inflation and look at the growth in real terms \u2013 the measure often used to define increase in standard of living \u2013 Australia has only increased by 5% since 2007. So does this mean all this wealth is a fib? Well, not really. While a 5% increase in the standard of living since 2007 sounds pretty poor, in the context of the world economy during that time Australia is well above average. Of the 34 advanced economies, Australia has the 8th best growth. And when compared to the 6% decline in the UK's living standard since 2007, 5% looks fairly impressive. Moreover, even when accounting for a constant exchange rate, Australia has the third highest average wealth in the world, behind Switzerland and Norway. So it is not all about the exchange rate; the reality is, Australians are, in a global context, stinking rich. How rich? Well, we are a mere 0.36% of the world's adult population but we account for 3.78% of the world's top 1% wealthiest.
