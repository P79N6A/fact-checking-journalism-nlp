      "bodyText": "The outgoing deputy governor of the Bank of England has warned that the UK faces a bumpy recovery with rising interest rates likely to trigger shocks along the way. Charlie Bean, who retires next month after 14 years at the Bank, said current low levels of volatility were \"eerily reminiscent\" of the run-up to the financial crisis, but argued that banks were now better able to withstand shocks. But he warned that with rising interest rates the value of some financial markets could plummet as investors shift away from risky assets. He also voiced concern that the Bank's as-yet-untested watchdog role may not prove effective especially given some banks may look for ways to get around restrictions on risky but highly profitable activities. Bean said: \"Compared to the impact of changes in interest rates, we have relatively little experience of deploying macroprudential instruments... So, there may well be times when monetary policy is the only game in town to guard against incipient financial stability risks.\" But he played down the potential for a re-run of the banking collapse, arguing that banks had built up large reserves to protect themselves. He said: \"It is inevitable that at some stage market perceptions of uncertainty will revert to more normal levels. That is likely to be associated with falls in risky asset prices\". But because \"banks are better capitalised, leverage is lower and we are better placed to deal with financial institutions that get into trouble, the risk of major financial problems crystallising in the advanced countries should be much lower\". Speaking at the London School of Economics, Bean conceded that he had been complacent leading up to the financial crisis, believing that the past seven years \"marked by financial instability and a deep recession\" was a \"salutary lesson for those, like me, who thought we had successfully cracked the problem of steering the economy\". Last week Bank governor Mark Carney said Bean was renowned as one of the world's most respected economists and a great loss to the Bank. An academic who moved into policymaking, Bean is one of the UK's most published economists and ranks as one of the most in demand at conferences around the world. He last hit the headlines in 2010 when he urged Britons to go out and spend to help invigorate the economic recovery. In unusually unguarded comment for a banker, Bean told Channel 4 News that people should stop themselves from building up cash savings that generate little income in a period of historically low interest rates. Bean, who sits on the Bank's monetary policy committee that sets the base interest rate, found himself defending headlines such as \"Bank deputy says spend, spend to save economy\" only months after the coalition came to power urging households and businesses to save to reduce their debts. His stance, which spelled out the benefits of consumers using the gains from low interest to spend on the high street, was respected in Keynesian economic circles but caused consternation in the Treasury. Bean told students at the LSE: \"The bottom line is that we may yet encounter a few potholes on the way to the exit. But the good thing is that banks are better capitalised now than in the run-in to the crisis, leverage is lower, there is better visibility of counterparty exposures, and we are better placed to deal with financial institutions that get into trouble.\" He referred to the exodus of funds suffered by Turkey, Brazil and other emerging nations after the US Federal Reserve threatened to taper its programme of quantitative easing last year and argued that there could be worse to come. \"So the risk of major financial problems crystallising in the advanced economies should be much lower.

When Bolland took over from Sir Stuart Rose in 2010 he set out an ambitious plan to add more than \u00a32.5bn of new sales with the target broken down across the UK, overseas and online. But by 2012 the company was already adrift and Bolland scaled back the sales boost he intended to achieve, to between \u00a31.1bn and \u00a31.7bn.

In 2008 M&amp;S made \u00a31bn in profits, but it has now been overtaken by the Next chain, which in March reported annual profits of \u00a3695m. Bolland's plan to increase sales was set against a backdrop of heavy investment in IT systems and of overhauling an outdated supply chain that still had more than 100 warehouses dotted around the country. \"Over the last three years we have transformed many parts of our business, investing to strengthen our foundations and improve our customer offer,\" he said. \"We are now focused on delivery.\" The clothing profit margins of M&amp;S were squeezed during the year as it was forced to discount unsold clothing, but Stewart promised the picture would improve this year as the company increased the amount of clothing bought directly from suppliers, which would be more profitable. The company will also save \u00a3130m after abandoning plans to open a distribution centre in London Gateway, he super-port on the Thames Estuary.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vodafone lost \u00a33bn of stockmarket value in its biggest one-day share price fall for more than five years after warning its 2015 earnings would be lower than the City expected. The world's second-largest mobile operator is using cash from last year's sale of its US subsidiary Verizon Wireless to invest \u00a319bn to upgrade networks and high street stores over the next two years. It plans to bring superfast 4G services to 91% of the European population by 2016, and more 3G mobile internet to emerging markets. Vodafone announced full-year results in line with City forecasts but its shares closed down 5.5% at 205p, the biggest one day drop since November 2008, according to spread betting firm City Index. Shareholders took fright as Vodafone said underlying Ebitda earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) would fall to between \u00a311.4bn and \u00a311.9bn by next March, down from \u00a312.8bn this year. The new estimate was worse than the fall to \u00a312.1bn City analysts had been forecasting. \"Vodafone continues to spin the plates with mixed success,\" said Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers. \"The writedowns across several European regions are further proof of the challenges the company is facing, with underlying profit continuing to move in the wrong direction.\" Citing \"significant ongoing pressures\" in Europe, the company revealed it had written down by \u00a36.6bn the value of its operating companies in Germany, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic and Romania, taking the amount wiped off the book value of its European operations in the past three years to \u00a318bn. Moody's warned Vodafone's credit rating could be downgraded over the next 12 months unless the company strengthens its financial profile. \"Vodafone has exhausted the financial flexibility within the A3 [rating band],\" said Moody's analyst Ivan Palacios. Revenues continued to fall, down nearly 2% across the group to \u00a343.4bn, but the rate of decline has slowed from over 4% last year, and finance director Nick Read said revenues could begin to recover from the second half of this financial year. Vodafone now has 637,000 4G subscribers in Britain, up from 500,000 at Christmas, and plans to get superfast mobile internet to 99% of the UK population within two years. Chief executive Vittorio Colao said it was time to \"muscle up\" the UK business, but said he was still not happy with the quality of indoor reception over his network in London. Vodafone's network improvements will increase its capital expenditure from an average of \u00a36bn to nearly \u00a310bn a year over the next two years, but the company warned the returns would not come for another seven years. Colao said: \"While cash flow will be depressed during this investment phase, our intention to continue to grow dividends per share annually demonstrates our confidence in strong future cash flow generation.\" He declared a final dividend of 7.47p per share, giving total dividends up 8% in the year to 11p. Dario Talmesio, telecoms analyst at research firm Ovum, said: \"Unfortunately, the uptake of data fails to deliver in financial terms. Revenues continue to fall for Vodafone Group, meanwhile margins have severely deteriorated. There is a certain paradox here: Vodafone is putting most of its commercial and investment efforts in something that is not turning revenues.\"Service revenues \u2013 which exclude handset sales but include calls, texts and data charges \u2013 declined 17% in Italy,13% in Spain and 6% in Germany. They improved by 13% in India, which is overtaking Turkey (up 8%) as the group's fastest growing market.",

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca told its shareholders to stop trying to pressure it into reconsidering its decision to reject Pfizer's \u00a369bn takeover. Leif Johansson, chairman of the British-Swedish drugs company, said he wanted to make it \"absolutely clear\" that it was legally impossible for Pfizer to increase its \u00a355-a-share offer and there could be no further negotiation on the value of a takeover. \"We have decided that it is necessary to issue a statement to make absolutely clear that Pfizer's final proposal, which the board rejected, is not capable under Takeover Panel rules of being increased or even suggested at being increased, privately or publicly, with or without the board's approval or recommendation,\" he said in a late night stock exchange announcement on Tuesday. Johansson's statement came after Pfizer tried to rally disgruntled AstraZeneca shareholders into forcing the company's board to reconsider the US drug firm's offer. AstraZeneca said it \"strongly advised shareholders to take no action\". Schroders, AstraZeneca's 12th biggest investor, had earlier on Tuesday accused the company of prematurely rejecting Pfizer's offer and called on bosses to \"recommence their engagement with Pfizer\". \"Schroders notes with disappointment the quick rejection by the AstraZeneca board of the latest offer from Pfizer and the decision of the Pfizer board to draw a premature end to these negotiations by calling their latest proposal final,\" Sue Noffke, manager of Schroders Prime UK equity fund, said. \"As long-term shareholders, we are strong believers in AstraZeneca and the potential for its innovative growth pipeline, however, given the increase in the offer we would encourage the AstraZeneca management to recommence their engagement with Pfizer, and subsequently their shareholders.\" Other big shareholders AXA Investments and Jupiter Fund Management publicly criticised AstraZeneca's management, and others were lobbying hard behind the scenes. Sources close to the deal had earlier suggested there was a chance that Pfizer could come back with a higher bid if AstraZeneca's board recommended the \u00a355-a-share offer to shareholders and then restarted negotiations with Pfizer to lift the price. However, AstraZeneca categorically ruled this out. It said Pfizer \"cannot even with the consent of recommendation of the board of AstraZeneca, commit to an increase in price (or suggest that it may do so publicly or privately).\" But other AstraZeneca shareholders spoke out in defence of the company's rejection of a takeover that would have created the world's largest drug's company. Fidelity Worldwide Investment, which owns 1.2% of the company, said the board had \"done the right thing\" to reject Pfizer's offer, which represented a 45% premium to AstraZeneca's share price the day before news of the bid was first reported last month. Dominic Rossi, Fidelity's global chief investment officer for equities, said: \"I don't think that Pfizer was a suitable partner. It was motivated by tax and financial considerations\". \"The Astra board has taken a very difficult decision. They understood in rejecting the offer they would be criticised by some shareholders. We will now have to wait two or three years to see whether they were right. With a little luck they could well be.\" Neil Woodford, the influential fund manager who controls a \u00a3350m stake in AstraZeneca, applauded the board for its \"resolute resistance\" to Pfizer's overtures. \"I remain convinced that an independent AstraZeneca will achieve far better returns for its shareholders than the combination of cash and Pfizer paper would have delivered. The long term future for AstraZeneca looks very bright indeed.\" He warned that a takeover by Pfizer, which has a track record of aggressive cost-cutting, would have raised \"very legitimate concerns that the UK's critical infrastructure in this industry would be harmed\". Aberdeen Asset Management, M&amp;G Investments and Investor of Sweden have also supported AstraZeneca's decision to reject the bid. The proposed takeover is due to officially die on 26 May, when Takeover Panel rules state Pfizer must \"put up or shut up\" \u2013 make a formal bid or walk away for at least six months. AstraZeneca's shares, which fell 11% \u2013 the biggest one-day drop in its history \u2013 following the rejection of the bid on Monday, dropped a further 1.3% to \u00a342.32 on Tuesday. Meanwhile in the US powerful senators attempted to harness anger at Pfizer's plan to avoid a multimillion-dollar tax bill by buying AstraZeneca with the introduction of legislation to ban the controversial practice of \"tax inversion\". Senator Carl Levin, chair of the permanent subcommittee on investigations, was joined by 13 other senators in introducing the Stop Corporate Inversions Act. However the legislation is likely to prove controversial and would take at least a year to pass. Pfizer had said moving to the UK for tax purposes after it bought AstraZeneca would help it avoid paying US taxes on \u00a337bn of cash earned overseas. The combined company would also be taxed at the UK's 20% corporate tax rate rather than 40% in the US. The UK also offers a special 10% \"patent box\" tax on profits derived from UK inventions and discoveries. Read has said Pfizer would reduce the amount it was prepared to pay for AstraZeneca \"if we didn't have the advantage of the tax\". Sue Noffke, manager of Schroders Prime UK equity fund, said. \"As long-term shareholders, we are strong believers in AstraZeneca and the potential for its innovative growth pipeline, however, given the increase in the offer we would encourage the AstraZeneca management to recommence their engagement with Pfizer, and subsequently their shareholders.\"",

      "bodyText": "That's all for tonight. A quick closing summary: Lloyds Banking Group has responded to concerns over the London housing market by introducing a new cap on lending. It will now only lend up to four times income on loans of \u00a3500,000 or more. Sephen Noakes, group director of mortgages, said it was a \"targeted\" response to the capital's housing market, where prices have risen 17% this year. This prudent update to our lending policies is intended to manage risks to our business and for our customers.\u201d \u201cThe Group continues to support the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme as it has raised confidence in the housing market particularly outside of London. Help to Buy is not one of the factors driving London house prices. Just 2% of purchases in London in 2014 have been through the scheme with the significant majority of applications coming from the rest of the UK.\" The move got a mixed reaction - with mortgage broker Charcol questioning if it would work. AstraZeneca has insisted tonight that Pfizer's \u00a355 per share offer, rejected yesterday, cannot be raised under any circumstances. GM is recalling another 2.4m cars to fix a series of safety problems. The latest recalls cover problems with seat belts, airbags and automatic transmission systems. The UK inflation rate has risen to 1.8% for April, up from 1.6% in March, meaning prices are increasing faster than wages. The news has reignited concerns that Britain is still gripped by a cost of living crisis. Here's what economists are saying about inflation Business secretary Vince Cable has criticised Glencore after the mining group said it could take until the end of the year to hire its first female director. Marks &amp; Spencer has reported its third consecutive fall in annual profits, putting more pressure on CEO Marc Bolland. Vodafone has seen its shares slide 5.5% after warning that profits will be hit by the cost of improving its network. It looks like the worst day's trading in years. HSBC, JPMorgan and Credit Agricole have been accused of fixing derivatives linked to interest rate contracts in euros, by European Commission inspectors. Goodnight! GW To reiterate, AstraZeneca's statement tonight means there's no way that Pfizer's offer of \u00a355 per share can be raised. Some late news - AstraZeneca has just insisted that there is no chance that Pfizer could raise its \u00a369bn takeover offer, which was rebuffed yesterday morning. The UK drugs company has issued a statement to the City tonight to \"clarify\" the situation with Pfizer. It rebuffs the idea that Pfizer's \"final\" \u00a355 per share offer could somehow be improved (as some shareholders hope). AstraZeneca is adamant that Pfizer cannot raise its bid again. Here's the full statement: CLARIFICATION REGARDING PFIZER STATEMENT In it Leif Johansson, chairman of AstraZeneca , blamed Pfizer for the situation: \"We have decided that it is necessary to issue a statement to make absolutely clear that Pfizer's final proposal, which the Board rejected, is not capable under the Takeover Panel rules of being increased or even suggested at being increased, privately or publicly, with or without the Board's approval or recommendation. This restriction that prevents further negotiation on value is a consequence of Pfizer's actions. The Board has made clear in its statement of 19 May 2014 that it is not in the interests of AstraZeneca shareholders to recommend an offer unless the value of the company and its protected delivery to shareholders is properly represented by the amount and terms of the offer.\" The BBC's business editor, Kamal Ahmed, reckons this means the deal is definitely over. Dharshini David of Sky News points out that the new mortgage affordability tests are already restricting lending, even before Lloyds income cap comes into play. Here's the Press Association's take on Lloyds' new tougher mortgage rules (announced at 5pm tonight): LLOYDS SETS UP LOAN-TO-INCOME CAP Britain's biggest mortgage lender is imposing a new loan-to-income cap on people looking to borrow more than half a million pounds in a bid to tackle the pressure of housing inflation in the London market. Lloyds Banking Group said that from today, people applying to take out a mortgage worth more than \u00a3500,000 will see the amount they are allowed to borrow limited to four times their income. The new policy will apply across the UK but Lloyds said it is primarily designed to address specific inflationary pressures in the London market. The policy will take place in addition to Lloyds' usual affordability checks and it will apply to mortgage lending through the group's brands of Halifax, Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland and Scottish Widows Bank. The group expects the change to impact around 8% of its lending in London and around 2.5% of lending across the country. It is understood there have been concerns that some people who are wanting to snap up high-value properties are also looking to borrow high amounts in relation to their income. Stephen Noakes, group director of mortgages said: \"Whilst the housing market outside of London is starting to improve, the recovery is fragile and prices largely remain below their peak. It is important we don't disrupt this recovery. \"But in London, house prices are almost now 30% above the 2007 peak. This is largely driven by issues of supply which are particularly acute in London and this is having an impact on income multiples which are failing to keep pace with asset growth. \"We're not seeing such issues across the rest of the UK and therefore this is a targeted response to an issue largely in the upper tiers of the London housing market. This prudent update to our lending policies is intended to manage risks to our business and for our customers.\" The announcement came as Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed that in London, property values have leapt more than twice as fast as the national average over the last year, with a 17.0% annual lift in the capital pushing average prices there to \u00a3459,000. Prime Minister David Cameron also said today he would consider making changes to the Government's flagship Help to Buy mortgage scheme, if the Bank of England suggests that they are needed. The London market continues to be a strong pull for wealthy cash buyers from overseas who are looking for good returns for their money. Mr Noakes continued: \"The group continues to support the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme as it has raised confidence in the housing market particularly outside of London. \"Help to Buy is not one of the factors driving London house prices. Just 2% of purchases in London in 2014 have been through the scheme, with the significant majority of applications coming from the rest of the UK.\" Toughened industry-wide mortgage lending rules came into force last month, which mean that lenders now have to probe mortgage applicants more deeply about their spending habits to check they can afford their mortgage repayments, both now and when interest rates eventually rise. Ray Boulger of mortgage brokers John Charcol has questioned the logic behind Lloyds decision to limit mortgages over \u00a3500,000 to a maximum of four times income. Boulger argued that those borrowing the largest amounts could typically afford to take the largest income multiples, as they have proportionately more disposable cash to make repayments. Boulger said: \"From a lending point of view restricting income multiples on larger loans doesn't make sense. \"Either Lloyds thinks the London property market is a bit toppy and it is taking on too much risk with these large mortgages, or it is doing the job of the Bank of England and the government and deciding that from an economic view they are not good for the country.\" Boulger said the key would be whether other lenders followed suit - otherwise the 8% of loans affected by Lloyds' move would simply end up with another lender. (via Hilary Osborne) Will other banks follow Lloyds' lead, wonders Bloomberg's Europe economy editor, Fergal O'Brien. Lloyds' clampdown on high-end mortgages come just a few weeks after new affordability tests were brought in, designed to prevent reckless lending. So where does tonight's clampdown on high mortgages leave the Mortgage Market Review, asks my colleague Hilary Osborne: While the FT's James Mackintosh is concerned that Lloyds appears to be trying to affect the London housing market. Is that its job, he wonders? Here's more reaction: BIG NEWS IN THE UK HOUSING MARKET: Lloyds Banking Group has announced that it is tightening the rules surrounding mortgages on high value properties, to address \"inflationary pressures\" in London housing market. The new rules means mortgage applications will be limited to a maximum of four times income on lending over \u00a3500,000. They cover any mortgages issued by Halifax, Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland and Scottish Widows Bank. Lloyds says it is acting because London house prices are now 30% higher than their pre-crisis peak -- primarily due to a lack of supply. Here is the full statement, just released: LLOYDS BANKING GROUP ANNOUNCES TARGETED POLICY CHANGES TO ADDRESS INFLATIONARY PRESSURES IN LONDON HOUSING MARKET Lloyds Banking Group today announces an update to its policy for new high value mortgage lending. From today, where the mortgage lending on a property in the UK is over \u00a3500,000, the Group will assess the mortgage application by applying an income multiple limit of four. This is a targeted policy change primarily designed to address specific inflationary pressures in the London housing market. The new policy will be applied in addition to our usual affordability assessment. Stephen Noakes, Group Director of Mortgages said: \u201cWhilst the housing market outside of London is starting to improve, the recovery is fragile and prices largely remain below their peak. It is important we don\u2019t disrupt this recovery. \u201cBut in London, house prices are almost now 30% above the 2007 peak. This is largely driven by issues of supply which are particularly acute in London and this is having an impact on income multiples which are failing to keep pace with asset growth.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing such issues across the rest of the UK and therefore this is a targeted response to an issue largely in the upper tiers of the London housing market. This prudent update to our lending policies is intended to manage risks to our business and for our customers.\u201d \u201cThe Group continues to support the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme as it has raised confidence in the housing market particularly outside of London. Help to Buy is not one of the factors driving London house prices. Just 2% of purchases in London in 2014 have been through the scheme with the significant majority of applications coming from the rest of the UK.\u201d The Group expects this policy change to impact around 8% of our lending in London. This policy change will take effect immediately and applies to mortgage lending through Halifax, Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland and Scottish Widows Bank. General Motors safety problems have deepened, again - the US car giant has just announced that it is recalling another 2.4 million vehicles, to fix four different problems. This time, GM is recalling cars to fix problems with seat belts, automatic transmission systems, air bags, and the 'generator fuse box'. The recall will cost it $200m, doubling its charge for recall-related repairs this quarter to $400m. Today's four recalls means GM has now announced 29 separate safety and non-compliance recalls in the US so far this year. Here's the details of the latest recalls: 1,339,355 Buick Enclave, Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia full-size crossovers from the 2009-2014 model years and Saturn Outlooks from 2009-2010 because front safety lap belt cables can fatigue and separate over time. In a crash, a separated cable could increase the risk of injury to front seat passengers. 1,075,102 of the previous generation 4-speed automatic transmission Chevrolet Malibu and from the 2004-2008 model years and Pontiac G6 from the 2005-2008 model years because of a shift cable that could wear out over time, resulting in mismatches of the gear position indicated by the shift lever. 1,402 Cadillac Escalades and Escalade ESVs from the 2015 model year because an insufficiently heated plastic weld that attaches the passenger side air bag to the instrument panel assembly could result in a partial deployment of the air bag in the event of a crash. 58 Chevrolet Silverado HD and GMC Sierra HD full-size pickups from the 2015 model year because retention clips attaching the generator fuse block to the vehicle body can become loose and lead to a potential fire. GM says it is aware of \"18 crashes and one injury among the 4-speed Malibu and G6 population\" (related to the transmission problems). It says there are \"no fatalities associated with these recalls\". Full statement here. The recall comes just days after GM was fined $35m over the problems with its faulty ignition switch, linked to 13 deaths. Ivan Palacios, Moody\u2019s analyst for Vodafone, warns that the mobile operator's credit rating could be cut if its finances don't improve. He writes: \u201cMoody\u2019s negative outlook for Vodafone reflects the weakness of the company's credit metrics for the A3 rating category, with no headroom for deviation in terms of operating performance or for further debt-financed acquisitions. Vodafone has exhausted the financial flexibility within the A3 rating that it had created following the sale of its 45% equity stake in Verizon Wireless. The rating could be downgraded over the next 12 months if the company does not strengthen its financial profile.\u201d A3 is the seventh-highest notch on Moody's scale, four places above 'junk'. While today's tumble in Vodafone's share price is bad for investors, we shouldn't forget that the billions it is spending on new infrastructure should deliver better services in future. And the competition and regulatory pressures Vodafone is suffering in Europe means better prices for consumers. The Vodafone selloff is picking up pace - share are now down 5.3% after it warned earnings in 2015 will be lower as it pays the cost of it major network revamp. Joshua Raymond of City Index reckons it could be the worst day for the stock in years. This morning's surprise rise in UK inflation, to 1.8% in April, given the pound a lift in the foreign exchange markets today. Sterling equalled a five-and-a-half-year high against a basket of currencies, and hit a 16-month high of \u20ac1.231 against the euro (as this chart shows): Traders are calculating that the pick-up in inflation puts more pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, said: It fuels expectations for an early rate hike from the Bank of England, this despite the dovish tone of the Inflation Report last week. Worth remembering, though, that there's an Easter 'blip' in the inflation data, as transport costs typically go up over the holidays. A postscript to the protest vote against Tony Hayward in Zug today, which (we assume) is flattered by the fact that 33% of Glencore is owned by, er, Glencore employees -- my colleague Simon Goodley points out. If you exclude these loyal souls from the ballot, 12% of voting shareholders directly opposed Hayward at today's AGM, while if you include abstentions (and exclude Glencore staff) then 18% failed to support his appointment. It's another muted day in the stock markets, with investors struggling to find reasons to push shares higher. Wall Street just opened, and the Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 30 points, or 0.2%, to 16476. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are all slightly lower. The main European markets are also in the red. The FTSE 100 is down 40 points at 6804, a drop of 0.6%, being dragged down by Vodafone (-4.5%). The French CAC and German DAX are both down around 0.2%, while the Italian FTSE MIB is flat. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says there's been little economic news (apart from UK inflation) to interest the City: With a lack of macro data to scare or please, the FTSE 100 has continued to give up ground from recent highs. Here's City editor Jill Treanor's take on Glencore's failure to end its all-male board. Speaking of Glencore... advisory firm PIRC has echoed Vince Cable's concerns over the company's failure to add a female director to its board, and told the mining giant to hurry up. A PIRC spokesman said Tony Hayward's goal of finding one woman director by the end of the year wasn't good enough. \"If Glencore were to appoint a single woman on the board by the end of the year, that would still leave them as the laggard of the FTSE 100. The question of diversity has gone past one representative on the board,. Glencore should foreshadow to the market now what the 2015 targets are for board diversity, and they need to get a bit of a hurry up.\" PIRC, or the Pensions Investment Research Consultants, is one of the City's leading lobby groups. Glencore Xstrata chairman Tony Hayward has suffered a small protest vote, at the company's AGM in Zug today. More than 10% of shareholders either voted against Tony Hayward being re-elected to the board, or withheld their vote. All the other resolutions were passed with majorities in the high 90%. Glencore reported that investors holding over 504 million shares voted against Hayward's reappointment, while those holding 421.9 million shares withheld their vote (the traditional way of flagging up concerns without actually opposing the board) More than 8 billion shares were case in favour of Hayward, the former CEO of BP. So that's 94% of votes in favour of Hayward- falling to below 90% when you include the withheld votes: Full results here. As mentioned earlier, Glencore faced criticism today for its activities in the developing world -- as well as being blasted by Vince Cable for not moving faster to appoint a female director. Vodafone's shares continue to be pummelled after the mobile giant admitted this morning that profits in 2015 will be hit by the cost of improving its network. They're currently leading the FTSE fallers, down over 4.5%. Dario Talmesio, principal analyst of Ovum\u2019s Service Provider &amp; Markets, says Vodafone is succeeding in moving customers onto faster mobile devices, but struggling to make more money out of them. Talmesio explains: \u201cFortunately, video consumption is driving customer demand and upgrades from 3G phones to more advanced ones. Unfortunately, the uptake of data fails to deliver in financial terms: revenues continue to fall for VodafoneGroup, meanwhile margins have severely deteriorated. There is a certain paradox here: Vodafone is putting most of its commercial and investment efforts in something that is not turning revenues and that is mainly because of regulation* and competitive pressure \u2013 Europe is clearly the issue that needs to be addressed.\" * - such as the clampdown on roaming charges. Sources close to Pfizer reckon there is very little chance that unhappy AstraZeneca investors will create enough noise to force the two companies to the negotiating table. The comments came after Schroders urged Astra to resume talks this morning, as my colleague Rupert Neate reports: A source close to Pfizer said the company would be amazed if AstraZeneca's shareholders put enough pressure on the board to force it to reconsider the \u00a355-a-share offer before a Takeover Panel deadline on 26 May. \"They would have to make an excruciatingly loud noise,\" the source said. Full story: AstraZeneca shareholder calls on board to reverse Pfizer takeover bid rejection M&amp;S chief Marc Bolland has confirmed that no bonuses will be paid to executives or staff this year, after it reported its third consecutive fall in annual profits today. Business Secretary Vince Cable has laid into Glencore Xstrata for its failure to appoint a single woman to its board. In a hard-hitting statement, Cable said the mining giant had \"consistently failed to act\", and vowed to take up the issue with chairman Tony Hayward urgently. Today's pledge (see last post) to appoint a female director by the end of the year simply isn't good enough, Cable says. Responding to Hayward's promise to appoint woman by the end of 2014, Cable said: \"These changes are long overdue. The company has had over three years to address this issue. It has been saying for over a year that they were in the process of appointing a woman to the board, and I specifically met the chief executive to discuss its performance on this issue. It has consistently failed to act. The vast majority of Britain's top companies have got the message that a diverse top management team is good for business - it is simply not credible that one company cannot find any suitable women. I will be speaking with their incoming chairman Tony Hayward and will raise this as a matter of priority.\" After sustained criticism, mining giant Glencore Xstrata has promised to appoint a woman director to its current all-male board. However, it might take until the end of the year for Glencore Xstrata to catch up with the rest of the City -- hardly a signal that it is desperate to rectify the situation. At its AGM today, chairman Tony Hayward said Glencore Xstrata would appoint a female director to its board by the end of 2014. \"Glencore values and promotes diversity across the company,\" Hayward said, as he opened Glencore's AGM. Despite those \"values\", Glencore Xstrata is the only FTSE 100 company to not include a single woman on its board --three years after a landmark report called for women to occupy 25% of all board positions by 2015. During the AGM, Glencore Xstrata was also criticised for its conduct in the developing world. Jim Armitage of the Evening Standard reports: A private shareholder said his son had questioned him about the morality of owning Glencore Xstrata shares in the light of the huge amount of negative publicity: \u201cDaddy, I keep reading about this company in the news, what does it do when it goes to the developing countries it operates in?\u201d Hayward, whose permanent appointment to the chairmanship was announced recently, said GlencoreXstrata invests heavily where it operates: \u201cWhen we invest we create many very well paid jobs, and each of those supports families of seven or eight people.\u201d Back to April's inflation data, and Alan Clarke of Scotiabank agrees that living standards are still being squeezed - echoing Unite's concerns this morning. Clarke says: While it is encouraging that inflation is falling for goods that people \u2018have to\u2019 buy \u2013 i.e. food and energy, today\u2019s data continue to show a squeeze on living standards. The average worker that doesn\u2019t get a bonus is seeing wage increases of just 1.3% y/y versus CPI price increases of 1.8% y/y. Clearly both measures are volatile, but the fact remains that household budgets continue to be squeezed. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, says domestic labour costs -- largely made up of wages -- are unlikely to rise strongly this year: We expect world commodity prices to remain subdued and domestic labour costs will probably only rise slightly over the coming months. This suggests that inflation will remain around or just below the 2% mark. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, points out that we don't actually know how wage packets fared in April, but March's payroll data does suggest real wages are falling: \u201cAfter six consecutive monthly falls, April broke inflation\u2019s downward trend with the CPI measure rising from 1.6% to 1.8%. As a result, if headline wages growth holds steady at its March level, the squeeze on real wages will be back on. \u201cWe do not think this rise is the precursor to a sustained uptick. The timing of the Easter break boosted various prices, such as the cost of flights compared with April 2013, while the fall in petrol prices that we saw last April didn\u2019t reoccur this time round. Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, warns that global factors could push UK inflation higher: The real focus was the jump in core inflation to 2%, reversing all the declines seen since September 2013. \"The divergence between core and headline price growth shows that the UK has benefitted from lower global food and energy prices and a stronger sterling in reining in inflation. These prices are set on global financial markets and can reverse declines just as quickly as they fell. City investors remain unimpressed with Marks &amp; Spencer, whose shares are down almost 3% after posting its third annual decline in profits (as covered in the opening posts). CEO Marc Bolland is meeting City reporters now, and insisting that the task of transforming M&amp;S's IT and logistics chain is \"almost complete\" - even if you can't see the benefits yet. Another development in the interest rate benchmark fixing scandal -- antitrust regulators in Brussels have just brought preliminary charges against HSBC, JP Morgan and Credit Agricole. The three banks are accused of colluding to rig financial benchmarks linked to the euro. In a statement, the EU competition authority said: The European Commission has informed Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan of its preliminary view that they may have breached EU antitrust rules by colluding to influence the pricing of interest rate derivatives denominated in the euro currency. HSBC, JP Morgan and Credit Agricole had all resisted settling with the EU last year over the issue. Four other banks did admit their involvement in a cartel relating to euro interest rate derivatives, and were fined more than \u20ac1bn. Schroders, the asset management company, has made a late bid to reignite Pfizer's pursuit of AstraZeneca by urging the UK firm to engage with its US rival. Fund manager Sue Noffke went public with Schroders' concerns this morning, saying it was disappointed with both companies. She wants AstraZeneca to resume talks with Pfizer over its \u00a355 per share \"final offer\", before the deadline of 26 May, saying: \u201cSchroders notes with disappointment the quick rejection by the AstraZeneca Board of the latest offer from Pfizer and the decision of the Pfizer Board to draw a premature end to these negotiations by calling their latest proposal Final. As long term shareholders, we are strong believers in AstraZeneca and the potential for its innovative growth pipeline, however, given the increase in the offer we would encourage the AstraZeneca management to recommence their engagement with Pfizer, and subsequently their shareholders.\u201d AstraZeneca shares are still down this morning, though, having lost around 1% to \u00a342.48. Unite chief Len McCluskey is also disappointed that real wages are lagging inflation again -- it's proof that the cost of living crisis continues, he says. McCluskey added: \"People are living on a knife edge, there is no room for manoeuvre in family budgets and if interest rates rise they will be tipped over the edge. Cameron and Osborne have shown they are blind to the everyday struggles of people trying to make ends meet. We need an economy that works for ordinary working people, a boost to the minimum wage of \u00a31.50 an hour and end to the pernicious rise of the insecurity of zero hours contracts.\u201d (correction, McCluskey runs Unite, of course, not the TUC as I initially wrote.) The Labour party have accused the government of complacency, after today's inflation figures showed prices rising faster than wages. Here's Catherine McKinnell MP, Shadow Treasury Minister: \u201cThese figures underline why this Tory-led government is wrong to be so complacent about the cost-of-living crisis. \u201cWages after inflation have fallen by an average of \u00a31,600 a year since 2010 and the link between the wealth of the nation and family finances is broken. A huge turnaround is needed to ensure working people aren\u2019t worse off than when David Cameron came to office. \u201cWhile the Tories try to deny it even exists, Labour has a clear plan to deal with the cost-of-living crisis and earn our way to higher living standards for all, not just a few at the top.\" The government has welcomed the fact that the UK inflation rate is below the 2% target. Here's the official line from the Treasury: \u201cThe latest figures show that inflation remains below the target rate and well below half of the peak in September 2011. Lower inflation and rising job numbers show that the government\u2019s long term plan is working and Britain is coming back. The biggest risk to economic security would be abandoning the plan that is creating a brighter economic future.\" Rob Wood of Berenberg bank has found reasons to be optimistic about the latest inflation data: There was good news on the price of essentials, which has been heavily squeezing households. Petrol prices were still down 5.0% year-on-year. Food price inflation slipped to +0.5% year-on-year. Utilities price increases eased to 4.8% yoy. Indeed, on a monthly basis, food prices actually fell by 0.5% in April compared to March. Wood also points out that the late arrival of Easter (unlike in 2013 when it was early) has made the inflation data harder to interpret. We will not get a clean read on inflation until the May figures. An average of the past two months is a reasonable way of filtering out the Easter noise, which puts core inflation at 1.8% and headline inflation at 1.7%, close to the BoE\u2019s target. Having fallen again last month, real wages are unlikely to grow significantly for many months, warns Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. Archer reckons inflation will remain below the Bank of England's 2% targetfor the rest of 2014, but fears that many employers will still be reluctant to raise wages substantially. He says: We doubt that earnings growth will race ahead. Companies are still keen to contain their costs in an ongoing competitive environment while still appreciable labour market slack limits workers\u2019 ability to push for higher pay. Limited productivity growth may also limit wage growth. So, despite the strong-looking economic recovery in recent months, inflation is still rising faster than wages. Jeremy Cook, chief economist of World First, warns that wages growth won't pick up until the spare capacity in the labour market has been absorbed: \u201cInflation remains below target as it stands at the moment, but April\u2019s increase has seen inflation back to outstripping wages. Mark Carney, said at the weekend that the Bank of England hopes that wages will accelerate soon, as productivity increases, and we will see a near-term lull in inflation. \u201cLabour market slack still exists and we will not see wages increase meaningfully until the labour market tightens further. This chart shows how real wages are still falling in the UK. It subtracts average wage growth excluding bonuses from the CPI inflation rate -- if the result is negative (below the blue line), then incomes are failing to keep pace with rising prices. (via Jamie McGeever of Reuters.) Back to inflation, and this chart confirms how transport prices rose faster than other costs last month - driving the Consumer Prices Index up to 1.8%. In a flurry of data, the ONS also reported that UK house prices rose by 8.0% year-on-year in March; a rapid pace, but actually slower than February's reading of 9.2%. London house prices have surged by 17% in the last year, it added. April's jump in CPI inflation was partly due to rising transport costs, with airlines putting up prices to coincide with the Easter rush. Food price inflation eased, though, according to the Office for National Statistics: Increases in transport costs, notably air fares, sea fares and motor fuels, provided the largest contribution to the rise in the rate. An overall fall in the price of food was the largest offsetting factor. The timing of Easter is likely to have had an impact on the index \u2013 most notably for air fares and sea fares. The Retail Prices Index, the wider measure of inflation, was unchanged at 2.5%. The UK inflation rate has risen to 1.8% in the 12 months to April, up from 1.6% in March. That means prices are rising faster than wage growth -- as average earnings rose by 1.7% in the three months to February, and by only 1.4% if bonuses are stripped out. Detail and reaction to follow... Coming up next (at 9.30am), new inflation data that will show if Britain's cost of living squeeze improved, or got worse, last month. Economists predict that the Consumer Prices Index inched up to 1.7% in the 12 months to April, from 1.6% in March. If so, that would mean prices are rising in line with earnings (which grew at 1.7% in the three months to February, according to last week's data). If CPI rises to 1.8%, as some economists suspect, that would mean real wages are falling again... Britain's booming house market appears to have boosted flooring firm Topps Tiles which posted an 11.7% jump in sales in the last six months. Pre-tax earnings leapt from \u00a34.7m to \u00a38m, suggesting it is profiting as consumer confidence improves and more people move house. David Cameron has said the government would listen if the Bank of England urged changes to the \"Help to Buy\" mortgage subsidy scheme. After being pressed about Britain's buoyant housing market, the prime minister said it was \"absolutely right\" that the government is alert to dangers in the sector. When asked if the government would consider changing the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme to reduce its upper borrowing limit [currently \u00a3600,000], Cameron said: \"Of course. We will consider any changes that are proposed by Mark Carney.\" On Sunday, governor Mark Carney said the housing market was the 'biggest threat' to the UK economy, having seen prices rise over 10% in the last year. Marc Bolland can insisting that he's doing the right things, and enjoying his job, but the reality is that M&amp;S has missed the sales target he set back in 2010. As our story on M&amp;S's results explains: Bolland, who joined from Morrisons four years ago, has been under pressure from shareholder concerns that the billions of pounds he was spending were not paying off. Two years ago Bolland set out a revised plan to increase group sales from \u00a39.7bn in 2011 to between \u00a310.8bn and \u00a311.4bn. M&amp;S today reported group sales of \u00a310.3bn for last year. His original plan, set out in 2010, was even more ambitious with a top-end target of \u00a312.5bn although that was scaled back in 2012 with Bolland citing tough market conditions. M&amp;S profits dip for third year as retailer fails to reach sales target Here are the highlights from Marks &amp; Spencer's conference call with City hacks, via my colleague Sean Farrell: And as flagged up at 8.20am, M&amp;S's CFO also denied that its website was having problems, despite needing a four to six-month settling in period. M&amp;S's financial results haven't impressed analyst Freddie George of Cantor, who is sticking with his recommendation to sell M&amp;S shares, George reckons M&amp;S is a long way from cracking its womenswear offering (as the photo at 7.56am rather indicates): We continue to believe it will take a number of seasons before the existing team is able to manifest a marked improvement in performance in womenswear. There has, we believe, been an improvement in the showcase autumn/winter ranges but the branding and the demographic and age profile of its target customer remains unclear. George also fears that M&amp;S's efforts to improve its creaking IT and supply chain won't actually boost profits. AstraZeneca shares have also fallen this morning, down another 2.2% to \u00a341.95. Overnight, Pfizer clarified that there is no way it can raise its 'final' offer of \u00a355 per share without a recommendation from Astra, dampening any remaining hopes that the deal could be revived. M&amp;S is speaking to City reporters now, and denying that its website is suffering a dose of the gremlins: MARKS &amp; SPENCER CFO SAYS \"NOTHING WRONG WITH NEW WEBSITE\", NOT EXPERIENCING LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS Vodafone shares are leading the fallers in London, dropping 3% in early trading. It warned this morning that profits will be lower than forecast in 2015, partly due to the cost of improving its infrastructure (dubbed Project Spring) But it also wiped \u00a36.6bn off the value of its European networks, blaming fierce competition, a tough economic climate, and regulatory changes. Vodafone warned that: We experienced revenue declines in all of our major European markets, and related pressure on margins, despite continuing measures to control costs. Marks &amp; Spencer shares have dropped 1.5% in early trading in London to 444.6p, as investors react to this morning's financial results (online here), and the warning that creating the new M&amp;S web site needs a six-month 'settling in' period. Marc Bolland has defended his track record at M&amp;S, which he joined four years ago this month, telling Radio 4's Today Programme that \"I really enjoy my role.\" Press Association has the details: He pointed to the \"heavy lifting\" that had needed to be done with investments in IT and logistics which \"the company didn't do for the last 15 to 20 years\". \"So, over the last three years, we've done lots of investments that have made the company at the moment fit for purpose. Over the next three years there is more delivery to come and we'll certainly concentrate on that.\" M&amp;S insists that it is improving its clothing range, creating more \"quality and style\", after suffering a -1.4% drop in general merchandise sales last year. It told investors: Over the course of last year, we upgraded 70% of our fabrics, added more luxurious finishes and improved our 'better and best' offer with more leather, silk and cashmere. We delivered more clarity and distinction to our sub-brands to make them more compelling and easier to shop. We launched M&amp;S Collection, and by streamlining the brands reduced product overlap by 10%. But has M&amp;S cracked it? ITN business editor Jess Brammar isn't convinced: Marks &amp; Spencer has suffered a drop in profits for the third year running, as the company struggle to bring some magic back to its clothing division. M&amp;S told the City that underlying pre-tax profits fell by 3.9% in the last year, to \u00a3623m. It's an unwelcome hat-trick for boss Marc Bolland, who has seen earnings drop steadily since taking over in 2010. And a cursory look at the numbers shows that the company's food branches are propping the rest of the business up. M&amp;S reported that, in the 12 months to 29 March: \u2022 Total UK sales +2.3%: Food +4.2%; General Merchandise (including clothing) 0.0% \u2022 Like-for-like UK sales +0.2%: Food +1.7%; General Merchandise -1.4% Bolland insists that the company is making progress with clothing sales improving in recent weeks. We are focused on improving our performance in General Merchandise and were pleased to see early signs of improvement. Our Food business had a very strong year, consistently outperforming the market. M&amp;S has now \"refreshed\" its Womenswear departments in its top 70 stores, in a bid to boost turnover. But M&amp;S also cautioned that it faces some disruption as it tries to get its new web site up to speed. Our new M&amp;S.com site will take four to six months to settle in and, as a consequence, will have some impact on General Merchandise performance in the first quarter. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Coming up today..... new UK inflation figures will show whether the income squeeze in Britain eased or tightened last month. The Office for National Statistics releases its data at 9.30am - and economists fear that consumer prices index may have inched back up again, to 1.7%. That would put it in line with earnings growth in the last quarter -- meaning real wages would have stalled. In the City, two heavyweight companies - Marks &amp; Spencer and Vodafone - are reporting their full-year results. We'll be watching the fallout after AstraZeneca rejected Pfizer's \u00a369bn takeover bid yesterday morning. Many investors still aren't happy, but the battle appears to be over... And in Europe, there's still tension ahead of this week's elections to the European Parliament, with analysts wondering just how badly the established parties will do; and what impact that has on the eurozone... I'll be tracking the key events through the day",

      "bodyText": "What do these \"disappointed\" fund managers calling for more \"engagement\" between AstraZeneca and Pfizer actually want? If Schroders, the latest to join the chorus, stated out loud that AstraZeneca's board was silly to reject \u00a355-a-share one would understand. It would be expressing a clear and straightforward opinion. But that's not what Schroders is saying. It merely thinks Pfizer drew a \"premature end\" to negotiations by declaring \u00a355 to be a final proposal and it wants to \"encourage the AstraZeneca management to recommence their engagement with Pfizer.\" But there was plenty of engagement with Pfizer \u2013 that's what the talks at the weekend were all about. For better or worse, no deal was possible. AstraZeneca wanted at least \u00a358.85 and Pfizer wouldn't go that high. But, comes the reply, the price gap is only 7% and there is other stuff to talk about, like how a combined company would operate. And maybe a technical interpretation of the Takeover Panel's ruling on what constitutes a \"final\" offer has left the door ajar. Forget it. AstraZeneca's board took a view on what the company was worth and stuck to it. That is a role directors are appointed to perform. Equally, Pfizer's board set out what it was willing to pay, honouring its commitment to its own shareholders to be \"disciplined\" on price. If the two figures don't meet, there's no deal \u2013 and thus no need to discuss other material issues like the solidity of Pfizer's tax inversion plan and how to ringfence AstraZeneca research projects. For a clear statement on how the land lies, listen to Fidelity's Dominic Rossi, who happens to thinks AstraZeneca did the right thing. \"The Astra board has taken a very difficult decision. They understood in rejecting the offer they would be criticised by some shareholders. We will now have to wait two to three years to see whether they were right. With a little luck they could well be.\" Yes, that's a clear assessment.",

It would be expressing a clear and straightforward opinion.</p> <p>But that's not what Schroders is saying. It merely thinks Pfizer drew a \"premature end\" to negotiations by declaring \u00a355 to be a final proposal and it wants to \"encourage the AstraZeneca management to recommence their engagement with Pfizer.\"</p> <p>But there was plenty of engagement with Pfizer \u2013 that's what the talks at the weekend were all about. For better or worse, no deal was possible. AstraZeneca wanted at least \u00a358.85 and Pfizer wouldn't go that high.</p> <p>But, comes the reply, the price gap is only 7% and there is other stuff to talk about, like how a combined company would operate. And maybe a technical interpretation of the Takeover Panel's ruling on what constitutes a \"final\" offer has left the door ajar.</p> <p>Forget it. AstraZeneca's board took a view on what the company was worth and stuck to it. That is a role directors are appointed to perform. Equally, Pfizer's board set out what it was willing to pay, honouring its commitment to its own shareholders to be \"disciplined\" on price. If the two figures don't meet, there's no deal \u2013 and thus no need to discuss other material issues like the solidity of Pfizer's tax inversion plan and how to ringfence AstraZeneca research projects.</p> <p>For a clear statement on how the land lies, listen to Fidelity's Dominic Rossi, who happens to thinks AstraZeneca did the right thing. \"The Astra board has taken a very difficult decision. They understood in rejecting the offer they would be criticised by some shareholders. We will now have to wait two to three years to see whether they were right. With a little luck they could well be.\" Yes, that's a clear assessment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares recorded their largest daily fall for more than five weeks after disappointing results from Vodafone and Marks &amp; Spencer. Also on the way down was Tesco, 5.95p lower at 306.05p after analysts at Jefferies moved from buy to hold with a 310p target. They said: With pricing visibly tightening in the UK in the past weeks, we recognise the growing challenges preventing Tesco from turning itself into a mildly growing, strongly cash generative vehicle, as its relative price deficit has recently widened. The rebound in the shares is at odds with accelerating UK margin headwinds, hence our downgrade. Our proprietary pricing confirms an aggressive tightening by Morrisons in recent weeks. On our basket Morrisons is now fully matching Asda, leaving Tesco and Sainsbury some 6% and 7% more expensive respectively. Both will have to work harder to maintain value relevance, justifying our below consensus estimates (4% for the former and 9% for the latter). The implications for our previous bull case are severe enough to warrant a change of heart, in our view. The impact of UK margin pressures on cashflow are meaningful. The triannual pension review may add further to this (we estimate a \u00a3260m top-up in 2015/2016), underlining the need for more aggressive action. A Turkish solution could be forthcoming (injecting assets into Migros in exchange for equity?), but with limited benefit to the balance sheet. Realising value from Tesco's more strongly positioned markets remains the obvious option in tackling leverage. Opening new fronts for growth (eg India) or investing where discounter encroachment is absent (UK food online delivery fees) are unwelcome distractions. Meanwhile Morrisons fell 4.5p to 209.5p. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 42.55 points lower at 6802.00, its biggest fall since 11 April, not helped by renewed worries about Ukraine as well as disappointing earnings from US retailers including Home Depot. Of the FTSE 100's fall, just over 12 points came from Vodafone's decline. The mobile phone group slumped 11.85p or 5.4% to 205.3p after the company said its core earnings would fall in 2015 given the need for investment in its business. It took an impairment charge of \u00a36.6bn to cover asset write-downs due to intense competition and regulatory changes in Europe. Its 2014 results showed a 7.4% fall in profits to \u00a312.8bn. Marks &amp; Spencer slipped 5p to 446p as it reported a 3.9% drop in full year profits, the third annual decline in a row. But AstraZeneca recovered from early falls after its rejection of the bid from Pfizer, and closed up 21p at 4308.5p. Carnival cruised the top of the leaderboard, up 78p to \u00a323.80 after Morgan Stanley moved its recommendation from underweight to equalweight, while ITV added 3.8p to 176.6p as Berenberg upgraded from sell to hold with a 180p price target. There was also talk of ITV holding discussions to take a strategic shareholding in Australia's Channel Ten. Elsewhere BT climbed 8.2p to 379.3p after an update from Ofcom, which said it would not set the level of wholesale prices for the company's Openreach fibre service. More signs of the booming housing market - if more signs were needed - came as buy-to-let mortgage lender Paragon reported a 21% rise in underlying pretax profit and made positive noises about the outlook. Its shares closed 33.5p better at 383.6p, the biggest riser in the FTSE 250. But Afren, the oil explorer whose main assets are in Nigeria, ended 8.8p lower at 145.3p after first quarter production of 35,465 barrels a day came in below its forecasts of 40,000 this year. Dragan Trajkov at Oriel Securities said: We see the results on the negative side. Production (although in line with management expectations) is behind 2014 guidance of 40,000 barrels a day. Operating cash flow of around $150m (before working capital, after tax and interest) is fairly low in our view, especially given that includes only $3m of tax and $17m of interest, both of which are set to be significantly more on annualised basis. Finally engineering services group Renew, whose rail division repaired the storm damage to the Great Western Mainline tracks at Dawlish, saw first half revenues jump 48% to \u00a3225.8m and profits climb 65% to \u00a37.6m. Its shares fell 4p to 243.5p but Numis raised its target price from 260p to 280p, saying: Good interim results from Renew reflect very strong organic revenue and margin growth across all Engineering Services operations in the first half plus the positive impact of bad weather on Network Rail in the first half (demonstrating the importance of Amco in emergency repair situations). Couple this with benefits from recent acquisitions and the strong cash profile, and we maintain our view that Renew's growth profile remains one of the best in our universe and we accordingly raise our target price to reflect this and maintain a positive recommendation.",

At that time, 21 FTSE 100 companies had all-male boards. Cable made his criticism of Glencore as Hayward chaired the annual meeting of the company in Zug, Switzerland. It was the second time he had chaired the AGM after being forced to abruptly step up to the task a year ago when the previous chairman Sir John Bond had to step aside after being voted off the board by investors who were furious about the way that the merger with Xstrata had been handled. Despite speculation that Hayward was on the verge of announcing the appointment of a female director to its board, the new chairman merely said it was \"an important ambition to appoint a female director before the end of this year\".

Hayward had faced questions about his appointment, with some investors hoping an external director would be named for the role amid concerns that Hayward would have little influence over Glasenberg; the chief executive and his four senior lieutenants own around about 20% of the company. The outcome of the AGM vote showed that 10% of investors failed to back Hayward's reappointment to the board. However, the figure appeared to be kept low by the fact that 33% of Glencore is owned by its own employees.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ahead of its first full year results as a listed company, due on Thursday, there seems to be a divergence of opinion on the Royal Mail. On the positive side of the fence is Berenberg's Matthew O'Keeffe, who has just issued a buy note with a price target of 700p. As a reminder the company controversially floated at 330p a share and currently stands at 568p, up 2.5p. Even the most negative commentators have price targets well above October's flotation price. But first the positive. Berenberg said: We forecast 2014 revenue growth of 2.4% to \u00a39.50bn (consensus \u00a39.45bn). Our revenue estimate is based on a 4% year on year decline in UK letter and market mail revenues to \u00a34.60bn, which should be more than offset by a 10.8% year on year increase in parcel revenues to \u00a33.30bn. We forecast that General Logistics Services will increase revenues by 7%, contributing \u00a31.60bn to Royal Mail's top line. Consequently, 2014 will be the first year in which the revenue contribution from parcels will be more significant than revenues from letters. We forecast earnings before interest and tax and before transformation costs of \u00a3615m in 2014, some 3% ahead of consensus, which currently stands at \u00a3597m. A purely relative valuation supports 700p per share. We have looked at a range of postal peers, including Austrian Post, bpost (Belgium), CTT (Portugal), DP, PostNL (Netherlands), Singapore Post and UK Mail. The most highly-rated stock within this peer group is also the smallest (UK Mail), and the lowest-rated stock is not much bigger (PostNL). We have therefore weighted our postal peer group by market cap... Whether we look at PE, enterprise value/EBITDA or enterprise value/sales, Royal Mail is trading at a relative discount to its peer group, and if we look at dividend yield it is trading at a premium. At 700p, Royal Mail would be trading more like parity. Over at Espirito Santo, Alex Paterson is less keen: Since we initiated coverage on the 5 December, Royal Mail has achieved a positive settlement with the CWU, continued its efficiency programme and reported trading in line with guidance. However, the competitive landscape has intensified significantly, with TNT Post UK rolling out [end-to-end delivery] competition and significant capacity growth, enhanced service and Sunday and evening delivery from other parcel operators. Whilst we think Royal Mail does have scope to raise efficiency and improve its technology, we are increasingly concerned that the rate of decline in letter volumes will become unmanageable, it will be unable to evolve its parcel service offering quickly enough to maintain market share and the market itself will struggle to absorb the level of new capacity. Additionally, we expect the government will try to sell at least some of its 30% stake post results and anticipate this will overhang the stock. We therefore cut our recommendation from buy to neutral, decrease our fair value from 635p to 560p and lower our earnings per share forecasts by 25% and 9% for 2014 and 2015 respectively. And Robin Byde at Cantor Fitzgerald issued a sell note with a 500p target price: We forecast full year revenue of \u00a39.4bn with an operating profit before transformation costs of \u00a3680m. The market consensus range for full year operating profit is \u00a3617m to \u00a3698m, with an average of \u00a3668m. This broad range reflects the high operational gearing of the business and uncertainty over core addressed letter volumes, parcel volumes and prices. In late March 2014, Royal Mail announced a further round of job cuts, with a further 1,300 to depart. Total transformation costs for the full year were lifted by \u00a370m to \u00a3230m. We expect an update on cost cutting and negotiations with the unions. The dividend payment is a key issue for many investors. Royal Mail has guided to \u00a3133m (or 13.3p per share, yield 2.3%) as a final dividend for 2013, payable in July 2014. Market consensus is for a dividend [in 2014] of 21.8p share, a 3.8% yield. We note that historically European parcel companies have offered a 4%-5% yield, in part, to offset the risks to earnings growth from a decline in the core letters business. On the 2014 outlook, we assume Royal Mail will not provide \"hard\" profit guidance at this stage of the year. We believe that Royal Mail's earnings are likely to come under pressure due to its uncompetitive cost base, declining core letter activity and pricing pressure in parcels.",

The figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that inflation is once again outpacing wage growth, with the latest available data showing average pay rises of 1.7% in the three months to March. The month-on-month figure between February and March showed an increase in earnings of just 1%. Pay had finally caught up with inflation in recent months, following a prolonged period of real wage falls since 2008. The April inflation figure threatens to reignite fears that a cost-of-living crisis is not yet over. The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: \"Last month we were told the living standards crisis was over. Yet one month later real wages are falling again. Even on a measure that excludes the cost of housing, prices are rising faster than wage packets. \"It will be years before workers even recover the earnings they have lost since 2008, let alone start to feel any better off.\" However, Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics described April's rise in inflation as a \"blip\". He said: \"The rise in UK consumer price inflation in April should not be seen as a sign that the economic recovery is causing underlying price pressures to build. \"Instead, the increase in CPI inflation from 1.6% to 1.8% in April almost entirely reflects the impact of the later timing of Easter, which fell in April this year but in March last year.\" The biggest driver of the rise in inflation was higher transport costs as air fares and sea fares increased as people travelled over Easter. Air fares jumped 18% while sea travel costs increased by 22%. Petrol prices also contributed to the higher inflation rate, as unchanged prices in April compared with a fall in the same month last year. The rises were enough to offset a 0.5% fall in food prices. Despite the increase in inflation in April it was the fourth month that the annual rate was below the Bank of England's 2% target. The last period of below target inflation was more than four years ago. \"The outlook for inflation over the coming months is benign, with CPI set to stay below the 2% target over the next year,\" said Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Capital Markets. The Bank of England's latest forecasts published last week suggested inflation will remain close to the 2% target over the next few years. With a lack of inflationary pressure, the bank's governor, Mark Carney, reiterated that the bank would be in no rush to raise interest rates \u2013 on hold at 0.5% since March 2009 \u2013 with the first rise most likely around the time of the general election in the second quarter of 2015. The Treasury said: \"The latest figures show that inflation remains below the target rate and well below half of the peak in September 2011. Lower inflation and rising job numbers show that the government's long-term plan is working and Britain is coming back. The biggest risk to economic security would be abandoning the plan that is creating a brighter economic future.\"",

      "bodyText": "25 November 2013 Pfizer chief Ian Read tells AstraZeneca chairman Leif Johansson he would like to discuss a merger. The companies agree to meet early in the new year. 5 January 2014 Pfizer bosses meet AstraZeneca's leadership in New York for \"high level\" talks. Pfizer proposes paying \u00a358bn, or \u00a346.61 a share, for AstraZeneca. The UK company declines to enter talks and contact ends on 14 January. 26 April 2014 Read contacts Johansson again, asking to restart talks. With no concrete, attractive bid proposal, AstraZeneca's board refuses to discuss a merger. 28 April 2014 Pfizer goes public about its interest in AstraZeneca. The US firm says it is considering an offer in cash and shares at a \"significant premium\" to AstraZeneca's share price before speculation started. Pfizer says it will move its domicile to the UK to shield its non-US earnings from US taxes. 2 May 2014 Pfizer makes an increased indicative offer of \u00a363bn, or \u00a350 a share. Pfizer writes to David Cameron pledging to base its European operations in the UK and to have 20% of the merged company's research workforce in Cambridge for at least five years. AstraZeneca rejects the increased proposed offer. 4 May Labour leader Ed Miliband increases political pressure on the bid by accusing the government of \"cheerleading\" for Pfizer and calling for an independent assessment of whether the proposed takeover is in the national interest. 6 May 2014 AstraZeneca publishes a strategy update highlighting its drugs in development and setting a revenue target of more than $45bn by 2023. Johansson says: \"These are benefits that should fully accrue to AstraZeneca's shareholders.\" Business secretary Vince Cable calls for stronger assurances from Pfizer as part of its bid and says he is prepared to invoke a public interest test. 7 May With political pressure unrest over potential job losses and cuts to UK science research, Cameron tells MPs he also wants stronger assurances from Pfizer. 8 May Former science minister Lord Sainsbury calls for Pfizer's approach to be blocked and accuses the US firm of being an asset stripper that wants to \"dismember\" an important British company. 10 May 2014 In video statements on Pfizer's website, Read says a deal would be a \"win-win\" for all concerned and praises AstraZeneca's Cambridge research hub along with UK science in general. 13 May 2014 Read and AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot appear separately at the business, innovation and skills committee. Soriot says a merger could endanger lives by delaying the development of important drugs. Read dismisses the warning as a \"red herring\" but admits the merger would lead to job cuts and reduced research spending. 14 May 2014 Read and Soriot appear in parliament again, this time before the science and technology committee.

      "bodyText": "Vince Cable has warned booming house prices are destabilising the economy and any sane person should worry about what is going to happen when interest rates rise as the economy returns to normal. The business secretary also warned that household debt in relation to income is set to become significantly higher in the UK than almost anywhere else, and contains serious dangers that represent \"a real, real, real worry\" for policymakers and homeowners. He said levels of household debt were forecast to surpass those reached before the financial crash in 2008. His comments have emerged as a study predicted that one in 10 mortgage payers risk becoming trapped on unaffordable deals as interest rates rise over the next four years. The research by the Resolution Foundation thinktank found one in four would face financial difficulties after even a modest rate rise, but it particularly highlighted the 770,000 households that were likely to find monthly repayments eating up at least one-third of their disposable income by 2018 at the same time as being unable to switch to better deals to insulate themselves. In previously unreported remarks at a meeting of the Foundation last week, Cable said the supplementary Help to Buy scheme \u2013 designed to help people purchase existing homes as opposed to new-build properties \u2013 was simply feeding demand in London and the south-east.
