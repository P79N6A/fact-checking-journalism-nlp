      "bodyText": "Britain's economic prospects are the brightest they have been in more than a decade and optimism among consumers has surged to its best level in nine years, according to separate reports published on Friday. Business lobby group the CBI said its May survey of manufacturers, retailers and firms across the service sector showed the economy growing at its fastest pace since its records began in 2003. \"The UK economy is performing strongly thanks to rising business and consumer confidence, better credit conditions at home and improving global economic conditions,\" said Katja Hall, the CBI's deputy director-general. \"What's encouraging is that growth is becoming more broad-based, with solid increases in business investment over the past year. This bodes well for the year ahead.\" The rosy outlook painted by the UK business community coincided with a surge in optimism among consumers, as the resounding message about the positive economic backdrop fed through to British households. GfK's consumer confidence index rose three points in May to 0 - it is rare for it to consistently register a positive figure and May's reading was the first time out of negative territory since 2005. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) has now raised its forecast for economic growth this year to 3.1%, from its earlier prediction of 2.8%, as Britain leads other economies in short-term growth. If the forecast proves correct, it would be the strongest rate of growth since 2007. But the BCC dampened some of the feelgood factor with a warning that 2014 could mark the high point for the economy as households come under renewed financial strain next year once interest rates start to rise. George Osborne will be hoping to fight the general election on the basis that he is the only safe pair of hands to steer the economy in the years ahead. A spokesman for the Treasury said: \"Today's reports from the British Chamber of Commerce, Confederation of British Industry, and GfK provide further evidence that the government's long term economic plan is working, delivering economic security for hardworking people. Coming alongside last week's strong growth and investment numbers, today's figures show that the foundations for a broad based recovery are in now place. But we cannot take the recovery for granted and the biggest risk now to economic security would be abandoning the plan that's laying the foundations for a brighter economic future.\" John Longworth, director general of the BCC, said: \"The task at hand is to ensure that 2014 is not 'as good as it gets' for the UK economy. Everything possible must be done to avoid slower growth in future. We urge the Bank of England to keep official interest rates low for as long as possible, and ensure that future rate rises are gradual and modest. \"We have made far too much progress in recent years to simply accept that growth rates are permanently lower than they were before the financial crisis.\" The BCC now expects rates to rise from their historic low of 0.5% in the first three months of 2015, around six months earlier than previously expected. It said the additional burden on indebted households with mortgages would weigh on consumer spending next year and in 2016, holding back growth. The group expects growth to slow to 2.7% in 2015, and further to 2.5% in 2016. Charlie Bean, a Bank of England deputy governor, said the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee would move gradually to increase the cost of borrowing. He told the Western Mail: \"There is an argument for trying to move cautiously in baby steps, if you take large steps there is a greater likelihood of getting it wrong. \"So the committee has been clear in the guidance we issued back in February that when the bank rate does rise, and we don't think there is a case for an immediate rise, we expect it to do so gradually and to a level in the medium term which is likely to be materially below its pre-crisis average of around 5%.\"",

Managers at the National Grid are trying to assess what extra power might be needed to cope with a surge in electricity demand as kettles are brewed and lights turned on during England's opening and late-night game against Italy. These \"TV pick-ups\" can be highly significant: the Grid estimated an extra 2,800 megawatts of power \u2013 the equivalent of more than 1m kettles \u2013 were needed during the England v West Germany World Cup semi-final in July 1990. \"We are expecting lots of people to watch on television and we have a forecasting team of four or five working on this now. On the day there will be system managers in the room with them constantly watching and assessing demand. But ahead of that we will be forecasting the weather and trying to work out whether people will watch in the pub or at home so we can be ready to deal with the likely extra demand,\" said a Grid spokesman. The company's forecasters have already pulled out data from previous big games such as the England quarter-final against Brazil in June 2002 when 2,570MW of power was needed at halftime \u2013 even though it was 9.15 in the morning. Even during the group stages of the same World Cup when England laboured to a goalless draw against Nigeria in Osaka, Japan, the equivalent of 940,000 extra kettles were boiled at half time, according to the Grid. Britain is in the middle of a wider energy crunch because not enough power stations have been constructed in recent years at a time when many old nuclear and other plants have been retired or taken offline. But the Grid is convinced that there will be no televisions drained of power or kettles failing during the big games. \"In theory if we got it terrifically wrong we have the STOR [short term operating reserve] of back-up to rely on,\" said the Grid spokesman. A diversified network of diesel, hydro and biomass plants around the country amounting to about 3,000MW of extra power has been paid to be on permanent standby and always available to kick in to action at short notice.",

      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group will put reforms of its governance to a vote in September after consulting with its regional boards and independent societies. The troubled mutual's 17 directors met on Thursday to draw up a timetable for overhauling its organisation. The board intends to publish draft new rules in mid-August and put them to a vote in early September. The reforms are based on proposals by City veteran Lord Myners for a slimmed-down board made up of business people and two group executives. Myners faced opposition from area and regional boards and the five affiliated retail societies that have traditionally wielded power at the group. Four broad proposals leaving leeway for negotiation were passed at the group's annual meeting this month. The principles allow for greater representation for the Co-op's eight million customer owners but also leaves the independent societies with a voice. The rest of the current board, which Myners blamed for wasting billions of pounds and driving the group close to destruction, is set to stay in place until detailed proposals are passed.

    "webTitle": "Cartier and Montblanc owner in court action to stop online sale of counterfeits", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The luxury conglomerate behind Cartier jewellery and Montblanc watches is taking high court action to stop British citizens from seeing websites selling counterfeit goods, in a landmark case that broadband providers fear could change the content of the internet. Richemont, which also owns the fashion label Chloe and the Shanghai Tang department stores, has ordered the big five home broadband companies \u2013 BT, Virgin Media, Sky, TalkTalk and EE \u2013 to block access to seven sites selling fake versions of its watches and jewellery. The Geneva-based Richemont is asking the industry to police the sale of its goods using a similar system of injunctions to the one that blocks websites offering pirated music and films. Operators argue there could be implications for online marketplaces such as eBay and Gumtree, where genuine branded goods are traded alongside some counterfeits, or for the purchase of patented medicines online. \"If websites are to be blocked like this, then parliament ought to debate it first,\" said the internet campaigner Jim Killock, the executive director of the Open Rights Group. \"This law isn't designed for trademark infringement, which is an entirely different activity to copyright infringement.\" One of the seven websites Richemont wants taken down is CartierLoveOnline.com, which sells reproductions of its bestselling Love bracelet. The names of the others have not been disclosed to the Guardian. Since 2012, legal pressure has forced British broadband providers to routinely take down links to websites offering illegal downloads of games, books, music, films and television series. Once judges have been persuaded that an organisation such as The Pirate Bay is breaching copyright, any future internet addresses associated with it are simply added to the banned list and can be blocked without a new court ruling. Richemont is understood to be arguing that under section 37(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981, broadband companies should be subject to piracy-style injunctions when trademarks are breached. Gareth Mead, a spokesperson for Virgin Media said: \"This claim raises untested legal issues and we believe it should be carefully scrutinised by the courts.\" A spokesman for BT said: \"We're fully supportive of trademark and copyright protection, however we believe a thorough review should be given to any such requests that could affect online content. We're reviewing the claim and will respond in due course.\" The case follows the settlement in February of a seven-year battle by the French cosmetics company L'Or\u00e9al, which sought to have counterfeits of its brands removed from eBay. The European court of justice said in 2011 that eBay was not exempt from liability if it had knowledge and control over information about infringing items on its sites. Toby Headdon, an intellectual property expert at Berwin Leighton Paisner, said: \"This is all about a big tussle that is taking place between rights owners and internet service providers about who has to bear responsibility for tackling all this activity online. The pendulum is swinging in favour of the rights owners now.\" On a site such as eBay, where some counterfeit goods appear alongside of millions of legitimate items, injunctions will be difficult to impose. Experts say the case could also have implications for websites selling medicines across borders that may be protected by patent in one country, but generic in another. Killock said: \"It's better to simply prosecute the company involved and understand what they are doing. Injunctions of this sort are half measures because they don't stop the company involved from existing and operating, and the people potentially being criminalised aren't necessarily being heard.\"",

      "body": "<p>The luxury conglomerate behind Cartier jewellery and Montblanc watches is taking high court action to stop British citizens from seeing websites selling counterfeit goods, in a landmark case that broadband providers fear could change the content of the internet.</p> <p>Richemont, which also owns the fashion label Chloe and the Shanghai Tang department stores, has ordered the big five home broadband companies \u2013 BT, Virgin Media, Sky, TalkTalk and EE \u2013 to block access to seven sites selling fake versions of its watches and jewellery.</p> <p>The Geneva-based Richemont is asking the industry to police the sale of its goods using a similar system of injunctions to the one that blocks websites offering pirated music and films. Operators argue there could be implications for online marketplaces such as eBay and Gumtree, where genuine branded goods are traded alongside some counterfeits, or for the purchase of patented medicines online.</p> <p>\"If websites are to be blocked like this, then parliament ought to debate it first,\" said the internet campaigner Jim Killock, the executive director of the Open Rights Group. \"This law isn't designed for trademark infringement, which is an entirely different activity to copyright infringement.\"</p> <p>One of the seven websites Richemont wants taken down is CartierLoveOnline.com, which sells reproductions of its bestselling Love bracelet. The names of the others have not been disclosed to the Guardian.</p> <p>Since 2012, legal pressure has forced British broadband providers to routinely take down links to websites offering illegal downloads of games, books, music, films and television series.</p> <p>Once judges have been persuaded that an organisation such as The Pirate Bay is breaching copyright, any future internet addresses associated with it are simply added to the banned list and can be blocked without a new court ruling.</p> <p>Richemont is understood to be arguing that under section 37(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981, broadband companies should be subject to piracy-style injunctions when trademarks are breached.</p> <p>Gareth Mead, a spokesperson for Virgin Media said: \"This claim raises untested legal issues and we believe it should be carefully scrutinised by the courts.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for BT said: \"We're fully supportive of trademark and copyright protection, however we believe a thorough review should be given to any such requests that could affect online content. We're reviewing the claim and will respond in due course.\"</p> <p>The case follows the settlement in February of a seven-year battle by the French cosmetics company L'Or\u00e9al, which sought to have counterfeits of its brands removed from eBay. The European court of justice said in 2011 that eBay was not exempt from liability if it had knowledge and control over information about infringing items on its sites.</p> <p>Toby Headdon, an intellectual property expert at Berwin Leighton Paisner, said: \"This is all about a big tussle that is taking place between rights owners and internet service providers about who has to bear responsibility for tackling all this activity online. The pendulum is swinging in favour of the rights owners now.\"</p> <p>On a site such as eBay, where some counterfeit goods appear alongside of millions of legitimate items, injunctions will be difficult to impose. Experts say the case could also have implications for websites selling medicines across borders that may be protected by patent in one country, but generic in another.</p> <p>Killock said: \"It's better to simply prosecute the company involved and understand what they are doing. Injunctions of this sort are half measures because they don't stop the company involved from existing and operating, and the people potentially being criminalised aren't necessarily being heard.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last year's hot summer helped Severn Trent lift annual earnings and dividends, according to the water supplier, whose new boss Liv Garfield is preparing to agree a five-year plan with regulators amid pressure to keep bills down. The group said underlying profit before tax rose 7.1% to \u00a3269.1m for the year to 31 March. It increased its shareholder pay-out with a pledge of another hike next year \u2013 despite bill rises being kept at or below inflation. But Garfield \u2013 the FTSE 100's youngest chief executive \u2013 said future pay-out policy could not be determined until Ofwat's final decision at the end of this year on its business plan for 2015-2020. The 38-year-old former BT high-flyer said Severn Trent would submit a revised plan for the period to the regulator next month. Ofwat wants firms to accept lower returns to help ease the strain on hard-pressed family finances. Garfield also spelled out where the company needed to do better - with sewer blockages, water quality at treatment works and lengthy supply interruptions \"below the standards we set ourselves\". Severn Trent Water, the main division of the group that supplies 4.3m households and businesses across the Midlands and parts of Wales, saw turnover increase 2% to \u00a31.54bn. The company said: \"The 2013 dry summer led to higher consumption from metered customers which increased turnover by \u00a37.1m year on year.\" But Garfield, who started as chief executive eight weeks ago, indicated she was preparing to make her mark on the business after \"exploring the organisation from top to toe\". She said: \"We know there is much more we need to do to improve our processes, speed up decision making and raise our standards.\" Garfield faces a challenge in agreeing Severn Trent's future plans with Ofwat. The regulator has already sent back an initial submission despite the group setting out plans to lift investment by \u00a3600m to \u00a33.2 billion and keep price rises at an average of 1.2% below inflation. Analysts fear the final regulatory blueprint could cut the healthy dividends handed out to investors. Severn Trent said it will submit a revised plan to Ofwat on 27 June, and expects a final settlement in December. The utility said it would lift its total dividend for the year by 6% and next year this will grow again by 5.6%.

The truth is that much of the damage done to customer trust at Centrica's subsidiary British Gas and the other big six energy companies, has been self inflicted, and politicians such as Ed Milliband have just picked up on understandable anger. It is true that energy companies have been overly blamed by some politicians for wider issues, such as rising wholesale prices coupled with the price of countering climate change. But the industry's ability to put its arguments across has been undermined by high executive pay, doorstep mis-selling and a series of other licence transgressions and service failures that ended in fines and public opprobrium. In the middle of this upheaval has been Centrica, Britain's biggest and best known energy brand, which has made matters worse with its repeated warnings about \"lights going out\" whenever it did not like what it saw. The company should have positioned itself as the country's consumer-friendly national and natural power provider, but instead found itself appealing for help from an audience that switched off from its special pleadings years ago.

      "bodyText": "The row over Thomas Piketty's bestselling book Capital in the 21st Century has taken a new twist after the journalist who said he had uncovered mistakes in the French economist's work was accused of making \"serious errors\" of his own. Analysis by the economic consultant Howard Reed published on the Guardian's datablog supported Piketty's view that inequality of wealth has been rising in recent years and dismissed the attack on some of the book's findings by the Financial Times journalist Chris Giles. Rightwing opponents of Piketty seized on the FT critique after Giles accused the Paris-based economist of cherry-picking data and pointed to unexplained entries on spreadsheets and big discrepancies between Piketty's estimates of wealth trends in Britain and the picture portrayed by official figures. Reed said the discrepancies were caused by Piketty making allowances for the different estimates of wealth in six data sources used to calculate the trend since the early 19th century. Giles, he added, had failed to adjust for these \"discontinuities\" in the data. \"Taken as a whole, these discontinuities imply that the estimate of the top 10% share of wealth is 22.5 percentage points lower by 2010 than it would have been if the wealth statistics had been collected on a consistent basis after 1974, as they were before 1974. As I show, the main difference between the Piketty time series for UK inequality and the Giles time series for UK inequality is that Piketty corrects his data series to allow for this 23 percentage point drop (caused by changes in the methodology used to measure the wealth distribution) whereas Giles does not.\" Reed said in his blog: \"To believe that the Giles series represents an accurate picture of the evolution of wealth inequality in the UK over the last 50 years, one would have to believe that the wealth share of the top 10% really did fall by 12 percentage points during the 1970s, and by another 11 percentage points between 2005 and 2006. Does anyone really believe this? Of course not.\" The FT has been surprised by the furore caused by its attack on Piketty and is now keen to take the heat out of the row. Giles declined to respond to Reed's analysis. Reed, however, acknowledged that Giles had \"uncovered some errors and inconsistencies which Piketty will hopefully address in future work\". This showed the importance of checking results, he said, especially when they involved spreadsheets, where it was easy to make errors. \"However, Giles then goes on to make a very serious error of his own in handling the UK data: he treats changes in the way wealth inequality is measured over the decades as if they were real changes in the underlying distribution of wealth. This error leads him to the misleading conclusion that wealth inequality fell in the UK between 1980 and 2010, whereas in fact it has increased (although not by quite as much as Piketty's published results would suggest).\" Interest in both Piketty and inequality shows little sign of waning. Both Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, and Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, cited the need to narrow the gap between rich and poor in speeches this week. Andy Haldane, the Bank's executive director for financial stability, cited Capital in the 21st Century directly in a speech released on Thursday. The bank official said: \"Enough has already been said and written about a book bought by many, read by few and understood by even fewer (Piketty (2014). I am guilty on all three charges. \"I suspect never, in the field of human endeavour, has so simple a line chart done so much to fuel the debate among so many, not just in the salons of Paris but in the Starbucks of London and New York. \"Suffice to say, the inequality issue seems unlikely to be a French fashion. It is a global public policy trend and a rising one.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economy contracted for the first time in three years in early 2014 after a much worse performance than originally feared. Washington's commerce department said the world's biggest economy shrank at an annual rate of 1% during the first quarter \u2013 a period marked by an unusually harsh winter in some of the more populous states. Wall Street had been braced for the revised data to come in below the first estimate of 0.1% annualised growth between January and March but was surprised by the extent of the decline. Analysts are confident that growth will bounce back in the second quarter and pointed to the underlying strength of consumer spending during the period when the economy was contracting. ING's James Knightley said most of the downward revision to growth had been caused by companies running down their stocks and said the contraction was not as bad as it looked. Noting that many companies were likely to have run down inventories due to transport problems caused by the bad weather, Knightley added: \"With demand indicators looking pretty good for the second quarter of 2014 we are expecting a much stronger outcome for GDP growth in the current quarter (4.5% annualised) with inventory rebuilding likely to play its part.\" Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said the run-down in inventories in the first quarter would lead to the bounce-back in the second quarter being even bigger because companies would be rebuilding their stocks of goods. The official data leaves the US one quarter away from the technical definition of a recession \u2013 two consecutive quarters of falling output \u2013 but Ashworth said this was not going to happen. \"For those worried about a recession, it's worth remembering that employment increased by nearly 300,000 in April and jobless claims dropped to 300,000 last week. Those numbers point to a recovery gathering some real momentum at last. We still expect second-quarter GDP growth to come in close to 3.5%.\" Republicans seized on the news as evidence that President Barack Obama's economic policies were failing. \"The president promised the American people an economy 'built to last,' but instead he's got us caught in a game of Chutes and Ladders: one step forward, two steps back. Americans asking 'where are the jobs?' deserve better than this new normal of fits and starts,\" House speaker John Boehner said in a statement. The GDP report comes a week ahead of the US's latest monthly jobs report. In April the economy added 288,000 new jobs with gains across the board driving down the unemployment rate to 6.3%, its lowest level in six years. PNC Bank chief economist Stuart Hoffman said he expected the Commerce Department would announce another 200,000 gain in its May nonfarm payroll report. \"The trend in the unemployment rate remains down and we expect it to reach 6.1% by the end of this year,\" he said. \"I believe this real GDP decline, mostly due to the polar vortex, coiled the 'economic spring' even tighter for a sharp snap- back this quarter where I have an above-consensus forecast for a 4.0% annualized rise in real GDP. I expect real GDP growth to settle back down to near a 2.8% annual rate in the second half of this year,\" he said. US stock markets shrugged off the news, rising marginally in morning trading.",

He expects to see growth roaring back in the current quarter:.</p> <p>Here's his note to clients:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For a start, the downward revision is almost entirely because inventories were a much bigger drag on growth than previously thought. Inventories subtracted 1.6% from overall GDP growth in the second estimate, compared with a more modest 0.6% in the first estimate. But that bigger first-quarter drag means that we are likely to see a bigger bounce back in the second quarter.</p> <p>More generally, the first-quarter contraction was quite obviously due to the unusually severe winter. It hit durable goods consumption, residential investment, business investment in non-residential structures and exports. But the incoming monthly data already point to a marked turnaround in the second quarter. For those worried about a recession, it's worth remembering that employment increased by nearly 300,000 in April and jobless claims dropped to 300,000 last week [<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/29/japanese-retail-sales-kingfisher-france-us-gdp-live?view=desktop#block-538732b8e4b0a1efcbc04a23\">as flagged at 2.20pm</a>]. Those numbers point to a recovery gathering some real momentum at last. We still expect second-quarter GDP growth to come in close to 3.5%.</p> <p>Finally, the contraction in real GDP resulted in a 9.8% quarterly decline in corporate profits. The weather certainly explains some of the 8.1% decline in non-financial domestic profits. But falling trading revenue and the drop off in mortgage originations caused a 15.0% decline in financial profits. There was also a 9.1% decline in profits from the rest of the world. So while we would also expect a rebound in second-quarter profits, as the weather distortion is unwound, it may not be quite as dramatic as the turnaround in real GDP.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-05-29T13:22:42.990Z\">at 2.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-538732b8e4b0a1efcbc04a23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-29T13:20:24.654Z\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><b>There is good news for the US economy too </b>-- the number of people filing new jobless claims fell to just 300,000 last week, down from 327,000.</p> <p>And the continued claims figure (those who had been claiming for more than a week) slid to 2.631m, the lowest level since November 2007.</p> <p><i>A sign the economy is reviving from its winter chill?</i></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53872f82e4b05a3fd1ec1ae0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-29T13:04:50.617Z\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The fall in America's GDP is mainly due to companies <b>cutting back on investment</b>, particularly in new buildings, and holding back from <b>restocking their warehouses, </b>tweets Deutsche Bank's <b>Joseph LaVorgna</b>:<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lavorgnanomics/statuses/471997006656049153\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Q1 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GDP&amp;src=hash\">#GDP</a> was revised down to -1.0% from +0.1% previously, close to our expectations, because of weaker inventories and construction.</p>&mdash; Joseph A.

Inequality remains high. And some countries, still facing recurring internal conflict, are struggling to exit from fragility.</p> <p>Africa\u2019s success journey has been truly remarkable.

      "bodyText": "And that's all for today. Rolling coverage of the US GDP data starts at 1.30pm BST, with analysis and reaction to the news that America's economy has shrunk for only the second time since 2009. Our news story is here: US economy shrinks 1% over harsh winter And the earlier lunchtime summary has the other key points, including Christine Lagarde's speech on African poverty and Andy Haldane's speech on inequality. Back tomorrow. GW. A handy bar chart: Back in Greece, there is another protest underway. This time in the city of Thessaloniki. School caretakers, teachers and staff from state broadcaster ERT (closed down last summer) have joined with cleaning staff who are demanding their jobs back. I flagged up this morning that cleaning staff had been demonstrating in Athens. Back on Wall Street, the interest rate (yield) on 10-year US Treasury bills (US debt) has fallen to the lowest level in almost a year. Investors continue to push up the price of Treasuries (yields fall when the value of the bonds goes up), defying expectations that they would rise as the US Federal Reserve wound in its bond-buying programme. Better late than never (sorry!) - here's a link to the news release from the BEA, explaining that US GDP shank by an annual rate of 1.0% last quarter. In it, the BEA says: The downturn in the percent change in real GDP primarily reflected a downturn in exports, a larger decrease in private inventory investment, and downturns in nonresidential fixed investment and in state and local government spending that were partly offset by an upturn in federal government spending. This is only the second time since 2009 that the US economy has contracted, as this chart shows: Alasdair Cavalla, economist at the CEBR, says today's data will worry some people, but he believes the US labour market is still recovering: On two occasions during 2012 and 2013, US GDP looked likely to see a return to sustained growth, before slumping again. The Federal Reserve will be hoping that we are not seeing a repeat of that. Its Chair Janet Yellen blamed the latest slowdown on transitory factors, especially the weather; however, her tendency to manage expectations through speeches is in this case intended to reassure markets that the fundamentals of US growth are sound. This is warranted: job creation as measured by non-farm payrolls posted its best result of the year so far in April, with 288,000 jobs created. I mentioned earlier that recent US data has been quite positive. Well, Chris Williamson of Markit has tweeted a graph showing that Markit's PMI surveys (which interview firms across America) suggest growth will rebound strongly in the April-June quarter: Another photo from the archives, reminding us that America took a serious hit from the weather over the winter: On Wall Street, traders have reacted to the unexpectedly large fall in US GDP by, er, driving shares up to new record levels. The S&amp;P 500 has hit yet another record intraday high in the opening action in New York. DOW JONES UP 24.85 POINTS, OR 0.15 PERCENT, AT 16,658.03 AFTER MARKET OPEN NASDAQ UP 12.71 POINTS, OR 0.30 PERCENT, AT 4,237.79 AFTER MARKET OPEN S&amp;P 500 UP 5.62 POINTS, OR 0.38 PERCENT, AT 1,915.4 IN EARLY TRADING Here's economics editor Larry Elliott's early take: The US economy contracted for the first time in three years in early 2014 after a much worse performance than originally feared. Washington's commerce department said the world's biggest economy shrank at an annual rate of 1% during the first quarter \u2013 a period marked by an unusually harsh winter in some of the more populous states. Wall Street had been braced for the revised data to come in below the first estimate of 0.1% annualised growth between January and March but was surprised by the extent of the decline. Analysts are confident that growth will bounce back in the second quarter and pointed to the underlying strength of consumer spending during the period when the economy was contracting. ING's James Knightley said most of the downward revision to growth had been caused by companies running down their stocks and said the contraction was not as bad as it looked. Noting that many companies were likely to have run down inventories due to transport problems caused by the bad weather, Knightley added: \"With demand indicators looking pretty good for the second quarter of 2014 we are expecting a much stronger outcome for GDP growth in the current quarter (4.5% annualised) with inventory rebuilding likely to play its part.\" More here: US economy shrinks 1% over harsh winter Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG, agrees that the contraction in US economic activity in the last quarter is a one-off. He told clients: \"The second estimate of GDP is backward looking, We knew that weather dramatically impacted growth in the first quarter, and we fully expect a bounce back in the second quarter.\" A reminder of how bad last winter was in North America -- Niagara Falls froze.... Don't panic, says Capital Economics. Their chief US economist, Paul Ashworth, reckons the surprisingly large fall in US GDP is just a blip. He expects to see growth roaring back in the current quarter:. Here's his note to clients: For a start, the downward revision is almost entirely because inventories were a much bigger drag on growth than previously thought. Inventories subtracted 1.6% from overall GDP growth in the second estimate, compared with a more modest 0.6% in the first estimate. But that bigger first-quarter drag means that we are likely to see a bigger bounce back in the second quarter. More generally, the first-quarter contraction was quite obviously due to the unusually severe winter. It hit durable goods consumption, residential investment, business investment in non-residential structures and exports. But the incoming monthly data already point to a marked turnaround in the second quarter. For those worried about a recession, it's worth remembering that employment increased by nearly 300,000 in April and jobless claims dropped to 300,000 last week [as flagged at 2.20pm]. Those numbers point to a recovery gathering some real momentum at last. We still expect second-quarter GDP growth to come in close to 3.5%. Finally, the contraction in real GDP resulted in a 9.8% quarterly decline in corporate profits. The weather certainly explains some of the 8.1% decline in non-financial domestic profits. But falling trading revenue and the drop off in mortgage originations caused a 15.0% decline in financial profits. There was also a 9.1% decline in profits from the rest of the world. So while we would also expect a rebound in second-quarter profits, as the weather distortion is unwound, it may not be quite as dramatic as the turnaround in real GDP. There is good news for the US economy too -- the number of people filing new jobless claims fell to just 300,000 last week, down from 327,000. And the continued claims figure (those who had been claiming for more than a week) slid to 2.631m, the lowest level since November 2007. A sign the economy is reviving from its winter chill? The fall in America's GDP is mainly due to companies cutting back on investment, particularly in new buildings, and holding back from restocking their warehouses, tweets Deutsche Bank's Joseph LaVorgna: It's worth remembering that recent economic data from the US has been quite encouraging -- meaning economists are confident that the contraction in January-March was temporary. Here's Associated Press's early take: The Commerce Department says that the economy contracted at an annual rate of 1% in the first quarter, worse than the government's initial estimate a month ago that the economy grew by a barely discernible 0.1% in the first quarter. It was the economy's first quarterly decline since a 1.3% drop in the first three months of 2011. This year's dip reflected slower stockpiling by businesses, a cutback in business investment and a wider trade deficit. Economists are looking for a strong rebound in the April-June quarter as the country shakes off the effects of a severe winter. So why did the US economy contract so sharply in the first three months of this year? Today's data suggests that American firms were hit even harder by the awful wintery weather than first thought, as storms and icy blizzards ate into economic activity across the world's largest economy. The BEA reports that companies held off from restocking their inventories, and cut back on new investment. Spending on new structures was down 7.5% during the quarter. Exports also slipped by 6%, making another dent in economic output. And worryingly, corporate profits sank by 9.8% in the first quarter, the biggest decline in almost six years. Bloomberg's senior economist, Joseph Brusuelas, reckons the problems go deeper than just bad weather. Economists had predicted that the US economy would have contracted in the first quarter (as recent economic data has been weak). But no-one expected a full 1.0% drop in annualised GDP: Breaking: The US economy shrank at an annual rate of 1.0% in the first three months of 2014, the first drop in economic output in three years. That's according to revised data from America's Bureau of Economic Analysis. It is a sharp downward revision from the initial estimate of 0.1% growth (annualised). It's the first time that US GDP has fallen since the first quarter of 2011. In quarter-on-quarter terms, it equates to a drop in GDP of around 0.25% -- in comparison, the UK GREW by 0.8% during the quarter. More to follow.... A very quick round-up before the latest US growth data is released. Christine Lagarde has warned that poverty in Africa is unacceptable high. She's called on leaders to build infrastructure, build institutions, and build people.\" The IMF chief also warned that Africa's failure to educate its girls is costing it tens of billions of dollars in lost productivity In a speech on inequality, the Bank of England's Andy Haldane has suggested the current shareholder model should be revised to prevent firms being too short-termist. New data on the UK's Help To Buy mortgage support scheme has shown that it has mainly helped first-time buyers outside London. But analysts are split over whether HTB is helping, or should be reined in. European retailer Kingfisher has reported weak sales growth in France. While Japan's new sales tax hike has sent retail sales tumbling. Earlier today Argentina took a landmark step towards unlocking international finance, by agreeing a deal with the \"Paris Club\" of creditors over a $9.7bn unpaid debt dating back to its default in 2001. The deal, which ends Buenos Aires's long battle against the creditors, will see Argentina repay $1.15bn by May 2015, with further payments over the next five years. In a statement, the Club said: Paris Club creditors welcomed progress made by the Argentine Republic towards the normalisation of its relations with creditors, the international financial community and institutions. Realisation of initial payment under a formal commitment of Argentina to fully clear its arrears is a necessary and important step for (this)...normalisation. But as Reuters points out, Argentina is still battling a group of \"holdout\" sovereign bondholders who have declined to participate in a debt restructuring. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide in coming weeks whether to take on the case. If it does not, Argentine officials have said the country may be forced into a technical default, Reuters explains. More here. Philanthropist and currency speculator George Soros has urged the European Union to help calm the Ukraine crisis and stimulate its economy, by giving firms \"political risk\" insurance. Soros writes that the move would encourage businesses to invest in Ukraine despite the uncertainty created since relations with Russia collapsed. Faced with high premiums, most businesses would simply opt to wait on the sidelines until the storm passed. That is why the governments concerned must take over the reinsurance function and use their agencies only to administer the insurance policies. They could guarantee the losses in the same way as they underwrite the World Bank: each government would provide a modest pro-rata capital infusion and commit the rest in the form of callable capital that would be available if and when losses are actually paid out. How the EU can save Ukraine \u2013 and itself | George Soros US fund management firm Marcato Capital Management has put out a statement urging InterContinental Hotels to engage with the mystery US rival that is reportedly keen on taking it over. Marcato's Mick McGuire says: Regardless of the veracity of these reports, we believe that a combination with a larger hotel operator would have compelling strategic and financial merit and represents a unique opportunity to reshape the global hospitality industry. Here's the statement from Marcato. It says it owns securities equivalent to a 3.8% stake in Intercontinental -- which runs Holiday Inns and Crowne Plaza. As reported on Monday, InterContinental is understood to have rejected a \u00a36bn bid. A protest is underway outside the Greek finance ministry in Athens today, led by the cleaning staff who lost their jobs in last year's austerity cuts. They are demanding that the government complies with a court order and restores their jobs. Their banner reads: \"Reinstatement of Cleaners Now!\" Andy Haldane, the Bank of England's executive director for Financial Stability, has warned that the current shareholder model - where companies put the interests of their investors over other considerations - may be driving inequality, by encouraging firms to be too short-term. In an speech in Bristol now, Haldane suggests impatient individuals are failing to invest sufficiently in skills, and impatient companies are failing to invest sufficiently in capital, leading to weak productivity and growth. To some extent, this matches the stylised facts on rising inequality \u2013 rising executive and shareholder compensation and faltering real wage growth. The shareholder model may, ironically, have contributed to unfair shares. Corporate governance reform may be needed to make firms prioritise long-term planning and investment, he says. Here's Haldane' reasoning: Company Law in a number of countries, such as the UK, gives primacy to the interests of shareholders when defining the objectives of a company and its decision-making. The objectives and rights of a broader set of stakeholders, including workers, suppliers and wider society, tend to be secondary.... A set of corporate incentives which had as its fulcrum long-term company value and which more fully reflected the interests of a wider set of stakeholders might help rebalance the scales \u2013 for example, towards investing rather than distributing. The full speech is online here (pdf) It's a good read, as ever with Haldane (the brightest spark in the Bank of England?) discussing the impact of the financial crisis, and the Bank's actions since, on the economy. He touches on the Occupy Movement, saying: They took up the baton for the 99% in 2011. At least at first, Occupy were treated with all of the seriousness of a local student protest. But rather remarkably Occupy became a global outfit, albeit a rather loosely-fitting one. Occupy touched a moral nerve among the many. The 1%ers in Davos had inequality as their main theme this year. And he also refers to Thomas Piketty's research on capitalism: Enough has already been said and written about a book bought by many, read by few and understood by even fewer. I am guilty on all three charges. I suspect never, in the field of human endeavour, has so simple a line chart done so much to fuel the debate among so many, not just in the salons of Paris but in the Starbucks of London and New York. There's a mix of reaction to today's data on the Help to Buy scheme (see here) - some analysts reckon the data shows the mortgage guarantee scheme is having little impact; others argue the opposite. Rob Wood of Berenberg argues that HTB should be reined in soon: On the face of it, Help to Buy (HTB) is doing very little. 7,313 mortgages were completed in the first six months of the government\u2019s mortgage guarantee scheme, equivalent to 1.3% of all mortgage completions. The scheme was introduced in October and provides a government guarantee of 15% of the property value, making it easier for a mortgagor with just a 5% deposit to get a mortgage. Despite the apparently low take-up, this scheme is far from trivial. The indirect effects are much more important. Like an iceberg, the part visible above water grossly understates its true size. We expect the BoE to recommend watering down the scheme in its annual review in September. The Council for Mortgage Lending says today's Help to Buy data (see here) is reassuring - showing the scheme is helping the housing market in weaker parts of Britain: CML director general Paul Smee explains: The policy appears to be reaching the geographical parts of the market where recovery has been weakest, while accounting for only a small proportion of business in those areas where the market is more active. On the basis of these figures, the scheme appears to be successfully reaching its target group of creditworthy borrowers who would otherwise be unable to buy until they had accumulated a more significant deposit. Lenders are always mindful of what their customers can afford. Newsnight's economics correspondent, Duncan Weldon, argues that the HTB hasn't made much impact: But the prime minister insists that both phases of HTB have been a success: While the Economist's Daniel Knowles reckons HTB hasn't really created much new demand: Back in the UK, the government has released details of how its Help To Buy mortgage subsidy scheme has been used. It shows that a total of 7,313 mortgages have been supported by the second stage of Help to Buy during the first six months of its existence, with 80% going to first-time buyers. The stats also show that HTB has been most popular with households earning between \u00a330,000 and \u00a340,000, and to buy properties worth \u00a3125,000 or less. The data backs up the argument that HTB is not fuelling the boom in top-end properties; rather, it's helping people scrabble onto the bottom of an increasingly steep property ladder. Here's more key points: The total value of mortgages supported by the scheme is \u00a31 billion. Compared to total mortgage completions in each region, the scheme is supporting a higher proportion of mortgages in the North West and the East, and a lower proportion in London and the South East. The mean value of a property purchased or remortgaged through the scheme is \u00a3151, 597, compared to a national average house price of \u00a3252,000. And here are the key charts: The full report is here. Christine Lagarde also used her speech in Mozambique to urge politicians to boost female education and close the gap between boys and girls - saying it could be costing the region $90bn per year in lost activity. The IMF chief said: I know that most of the women in Africa cannot afford not to work. But when they do, they are mostly employed in informal activities. We all know what this means: low productivity, low incomes, low prospects. We also know the constraints: access to education, credit, and markets. The gains to be made by overcoming these constraints are immense\u2014particularly through girls\u2019 education. By some estimates, the economic loss in developing countries from the education gap between girls and boys could be as high as $90 billion a year\u2014almost as much as the infrastructure gap for the whole of Sub-Saharan Africa! As the old African adage goes: \u201cIf you educate a boy, you train a man. If you educate a girl, you train a village.\u201d My bottom line: invest in women. It has a great rate of return\u2014economically and socially for the future. International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde has warned that poverty in Africa is still \"unacceptably high\", despite almost two decades of growing \"growing strongly and steadily\". She's in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, at a conference called \"Africa Rising\u2014Building to the Future\". And her message is that much more needs to be done to raise income levels across the continent. Economic stability has paid off. More than two-thirds of the countries in the region have enjoyed ten or more years of uninterrupted growth. This growth has delivered a more educated population, with significant declines in infant mortality. In Benin and Madagascar, for example, primary school enrolment has increased by more than 50 percentage points. This may be from low levels, but it is still a huge improvement. And for good reasons, Africa is now a growing investment destination for both advanced and emerging economies\u2014with a record $80 billion inflow expected this year. Indeed, it is no surprise that \u2018frontier economies\u2019 such as Kenya, Uganda, and Botswana are challenging old stereotypes and roaring loud as Africa\u2019s lions. And yet, the tide of growth has not lifted all boats. Poverty remains stuck at unacceptably high levels\u2014still afflicting about 45 percent of the region\u2019s households. Inequality remains high. And some countries, still facing recurring internal conflict, are struggling to exit from fragility. Africa\u2019s success journey has been truly remarkable. But if the global crisis has taught us anything, it is the importance of making the benefits of growth more broadly shared. When everyone benefits, growth is more durable. What's the solution? Christine Lagarde says Africa's leaders must \"build infrastructure, build institutions, and build people.\" So: better roads and technology grids to encourage economic growth. Trustworthy and transparent institutions to take advantage of Africa's natural resources - such as 30% of the world\u2019s mineral reserves. And higher quality education, healthcare and infrastructure services The full speech is here. Kingfisher is looking beyond Europe for future growth opportunities, flags up Retail Week's Nicola Harrison. Analysts at ING say today's updated US GDP data (due at 1.30pm BST) could show that America's economy contracted in the January-March period. They're not too worried, though, as it's largely due to last winter's bad weather: There is a clear risk of a downward revision to today's figure, which could result in the first negative reading for 3 years. However, this was heavily weather related and activity for the second quarter so far is pointing to a robust rebound. Kingfisher's warning that France remains a tough business environment has caught the City's eye. Retail analyst Nick Bubb says: France also saw some weather benefit and reported like-for-like sales up 1.6%, with improved gross margins, but investors may be disappointed to hear that the underlying French DIY market was still weak, Richard Hunter, Head of Equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, adds: The company is aware of a restrained economic backdrop in France, whilst gross margins suffered in the UK given the rise in demand for cheaper products and a number of sales in the period. Last night, we learned that French unemployment rose by another 0.4% last month to a new record high, underlying the problems facing Francois Hollande. In other corporate news, British Gas boss Chris Weston is off to run temporary power firm Aggreko. An escape from fielding flack about rising energy bills in the UK? It leaves British Gas's parent company with three top jobs to fill, my colleague Julia Kollewe flags up: Centrica\u2019s chief executive Sam Laidlaw, who has run the company since 2006, is expected to leave before the end of the year and in January the group lost its finance chief Nick Luff, who has yet to be replaced. Weston, who will not join Aggreko until next year, was reportedly interviewed to replace Laidlaw but missed out on the top job. Weston isn't expected to start at Aggreko until next year. British food ingredients firm Tate &amp; Lyle has warned that America's cold spring, and \"prolonged and severe winter\" hit demand, as it reports a 3% drop in sales last year. It is also suffering from tough competition in the sucralose sweetener market -- eating into profits on its Splenda sweetener. Spain's statistics office has confirmed that its economy grew by 0.4% in the last quarter - in line with the initial estimate. Update: this graph shows how Spain has now been growing for nine months: April was a strong month for British automobile manufacturing, with the number of cars made in the UK up by a fifth. France isn't the only country where Kingfisher found it hard to grow sales. It also reports that it racked up a loss in China in the last quarter, and blamed the slowdown in the property market: B&amp;Q China sales were down 5.0% to \u00a368 million (-4.4% LFL) impacted by a slowing Chinese property market. Retail losses of \u00a37 million, in what is traditionally the weakest trading quarter of the year (impacted by Chinese New Year), were broadly flat year on year, including costs developing the new format trial of around \u00a31 million. The weakness of the French economy has hit Kingfisher, the firm behind B&amp;Q, and taken the shine off some otherwise impressive results. While like-for-like sales in the UK surged by over 10% in the last quarter, French sales only crept up by 1.6% despite retailers benefitting from much better weather this year. Kingfisher told shareholders that: Encouraging underlying signs in the UK &amp; Poland offset by ongoing weak consumer confidence in France It added that \"underlying markets remained soft\" in France, despite the small rise in comparable sales. There, Kingfisher operates as Castorama and Brico Depot. While in the UK and Ireland, there was \"much better weather compared to Q1 last year and some encouraging signs in both the underlying retail and smaller tradesman market.\" Retail profits across the group jumped 20% in the quarter -- slightly below expectations. But the warning about France may have alarmed investors -- shares have tumbled by 5% in early trading. The big news overnight is that Japanese retail sales took a real tumble last month, as the country's sales tax hit consumers. Japanese retail sales fell by 4.4% on an annual basis in April, the biggest fall in three years (since the Fukushima disaster), as people cut back on purchases of cars and electronics. On a month-on-month basis, retail sales slumped by 13.7% - Bloomberg says that's the biggest fall in at least 14 years. Hiking the sales tax from 5% to 8% last month has clearly hit households in the pocket, potentially undermining prime minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to drive up inflation and stimulate the economy. Economists are hoping, though, that retail sales will rebound in the months ahead, as Reuters explains: In one encouraging sign, declines in sales of apparel and toiletries were limited, which suggests consumer spending will pick up in May in line with the Bank of Japan's scenario, but there are worries that a recovery in durable goods could take more time. \"There are signs that declines in spending on daily necessities is already bottoming out, which supports a gradual recovery in spending,\" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior fixed income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. \"The one area of concern is durable goods. Sales of these more expensive items may take more time to recover.\" Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial market, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Lots of corporate news knocking around this morning -- with results from retail chain Kingfisher, sugar-maker Tate &amp; Lyle and water firm Severn Trent. Not much economic news in Europe... ....but we get updated growth figures from America this afternoon. It could show that the US economy contracted in the first three months of this year (the first estimate showed minimal growth). In the UK, Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale warned last night that interest rates need to rise \"sooner rather than later\" in baby steps, to avoid a crisis. Here's Sarah O'Connor's story in the FT: And we'll also be watching the government bond markets -- yesterday, debt prices rallied strongly, driving down borrowing costs across the globe. CMC's Michael Hewson sums it up: Bond prices continued to rise yesterday, but this time it wasn\u2019t just US, UK and German bonds that were in demand but peripheral bonds as well. US treasuries hit their lowest yield since July last year while both German bunds and UK gilts headed back towards their 10 month lows set earlier this month. They weren\u2019t alone either, unlike earlier this month when Italian and Spanish yields soared after the poor Q1 GDP data from across the euro area. This time Spanish borrowing costs hit new record lows on expectations that we could well get some form of monetary stimulus from the ECB at next week\u2019s rate meeting after comments from ECB member Yves Mersch that next week\u2019s meeting could contain measures to combat low credit growth. Given that bank lending has been contracting for 24 months straight, one could argue that such measures are long overdue; while yesterday\u2019s M3 data didn\u2019t encourage either. The risk remains that markets are overestimating the ECB\u2019s ability to deliver any punch next week, particularly in light of last weekend\u2019s EU election results the likelihood of any form of effective stimulus can be ranked from anywhere to between slim and none. I\"ll be tracking the key events through the day as usual....",
