      "bodyText": "He works all hours, first up and last to bed. He makes money and he spends it. He will take a bet on anything. A description of a foreign exchange dealer taking big punts in the City? No, think again for this is Hilary Mantel\u2019s description of Thomas Cromwell. The TV adaptation of Wolf Hall ends this week with the fall of Anne Boleyn. Throughout the six episodes, the focus has been on the political themes addressed in the book: Henry VIII\u2019s determination to have a male heir, who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down at court, the break with the Pope over the king\u2019s divorce from Catherine of Aragon. What the small screen adaptation can\u2019t really capture from Wolf Hall and the follow-up volume, Bring Up The Bodies, is the book\u2019s broader themes. Mantel\u2019s Cromwell tells us a lot about power and intrigue at the Tudor court. But he also tells us about class, the rise of capitalism and an economy in flux. The period of transition from feudalism to modern capitalism was long. Economic growth in the 16th century barely kept pace with the growing population. The economy had its ups and down but broadly flatlined between 1500 and 1600. More than two centuries would pass before the advent of the wave of technological progress associated with the start of the industrial revolution. Even so, the economy was gradually being transformed. Cromwell was not a member of the old aristocratic families: a Suffolk or a Norfolk. He was a blacksmith\u2019s son from Putney made good. Like his patron, Cardinal Wolsey, he did not have a privileged upbringing but had talent and ambition. Karl Marx would have seen Cromwell as a classic example of the new bourgeoisie. Mantel draws a contrast between the fanatically devout Thomas More and the worldly wise Cromwell: the one settling in for a day\u2019s scourging, the other off to get the day\u2019s exchange rate in the City\u2019s Lombard Street, where all the big banking houses had their home. The inference is clear. Men like More are the past. A new breed of men, pragmatic and servants of the state not the church, are on the rise. \u201cHe can converse with you about the Caesars or get you Venetian glassware at a very reasonable rate. Nobody can better keep their head, when markets are falling and weeping men are standing on the street tearing up letters of credit.\u201d This, of course, is fiction not fact. But the challenge to the status quo from men like Cromwell was real enough. In his book, the Wealth and Poverty of Nations, David Landes argues that the challenge to the Vatican from the new religion was a major influence. It was the dawning of a more secular age. \u201cThe Protestant Reformation changed the rules. It gave a big boost to literacy, spawned dissents and heresies, and promoted the scepticism and refusal of authority that is at the heart of scientific endeavour. The Catholic countries, instead of meeting the challenge, responded by closure and censure.\u201d Northern and southern Europe started to go their own ways in the 16th century. They had different beliefs, different ways of doing things, different cultures. Half a millennium later this gulf has yet to be bridged: witness the strong sense of protestantism that informs Germany\u2019s attitude towards Greece. Landes says there were two special characteristics of Protestantism that support the claim that it was crucial in the rise of capitalism. One was the emphasis on the need to read, for girls as well as boys. He says that while good protestants were expected to know how to read the holy scriptures for themselves, catholics were explicitly discouraged from reading the bible. Modern economics stresses the importance of literacy as a building block of development. In England, male literacy more than doubled to 25% in the 16th century; female literacy rose from under 1% to 10%. Mantel shows Cromwell, an early adopter of protestantism, educating his daughters. The second trait of protestantism identified by Landes was the importance accorded to time. Protestants were the makers and buyers of clocks and watches. \u201cNothing testifies so much as time sensibility to the \u2018urbanisation\u2019 of rural society, with all that implies for rapid diffusion of values and tastes,\u201d he says. But these were not the only changes happening. The voyages of discovery by Columbus and Magellan meant the known world was expanding. It was an era of globalisation, with new products available for import and fresh markets opening up. Cromwell is part of this world. He has travelled widely in Europe. He has contacts in Antwerp, then a more important port than London. He is a man of the world with cosmopolitan views. He speaks foreign languages and is keen to add Polish to the list. He would not be a Ukip supporter. The problems of the wool trader Wykys in Wolf Hall look suspiciously like a metaphor for the weaknesses of the UK economy in 2015. Presiding over a failing business, Wykys has got the wrong products, the wrong people working for him and is selling his goods in the wrong markets. \u201cLatterly, Wykys had grown tired, let the business slide. He was still sending broadcloth to the north German market, when \u2013 in his opinion, with wool so long in the fleece these days, and good broadcloth hard to weave \u2013 he ought to be getting into kerseys, lighter cloth like that, exporting through Antwerp to Italy.\u201d In good company doctor fashion, Cromwell decides he can turn the business around. He takes a look at the stock, casts his eyes over the account, then fires the chief clerk and trains up a junior to take his place. \u201cPeople are always the key, and if you look them in the face you can be pretty sure if they\u2019re honest and up to the job.\u201d Today we would say that he understood the importance of human capital. Once he had made Henry supreme over the Church of England and disposed of Anne Boleyn, he set to work on the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Rather like the privatisation programme of the 1980s, the main reason for the assault on the monasteries was financial: Henry was short of money and wanted the funds to fight his expensive wars. Cromwell could justify what was effectively the enforced nationalisation of church lands by pointing to the corruption of the monastic ideal, but this was of secondary importance. Nothing really changes. Governments always seem to be short of money. A modern Cromwell charged with sorting out the public finances might conclude that the financial sector \u2013 rich, arrogant and with a lamentable record of corruption \u2013 was ripe for the picking. No question: if Cromwell was alive today, the former chief executive of HSBC, Stephen Green, would be in chains in the Tower and the Dissolution of the Banks would be in full swing.",

      "bodyText": "More than a better camera, a slimmer handset or a larger screen, smartphone users know what they want most from their device, according to a recent survey: longer battery life. Doron Myersdorf\u2019s solution takes only a minute. His Israeli company, StoreDot, has developed a battery that can be charged in 60 seconds which he says can end dead-phone dread because no handset will be lifeless for long. \u201cThe whole anxiety of your phone [going] dead goes away because if [recharging] happens in one minute, there is not an issue,\u201d Myersdorf says. Although the StoreDot battery does not last as long as conventional phone batteries, its makers argue that the short charging time more than compensates. Myersdorf adds that handsets will become more innovative as a consequence. \u201cOnce you have an unlimited battery \u2013 because this is what we are offering \u2026 your whole applications and your whole usage model of the phone changes so you have better devices which are more energy-hungry, you have more applications which do amazing things.\u201d The StoreDot battery system emerged from the nanotechnology department of Tel Aviv University, a by-product of research being carried out into Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Researchers found interesting properties in a certain peptide molecule \u2013 a chain of amino acids \u2013 that affects neurons in the brain and causes Alzheimer\u2019s. It turned out that these molecules had high capacitance, the ability to hold an electrical charge. When two of these molecules are combined, they make a crystal which is two nanometers in size \u2013 two billionths of a metre. These \u201cnanodots\u201d form the basis of the StoreDot technology. Because of their increased capacitance, they can make batteries which rapidly absorb and hold a charge. That has led to a three-tier system from StoreDot for charging a mobile phone: the battery within the phone; a special charger which can pump a strong electrical current into the phone; and the system within the phone which manages power use efficiently . \u201cThe charger itself is not a normal charger. We need to pump 40/50 and up to 80 amps of current into this battery in order to charge in one minute. No normal charger can do that. So we had to develop a very strong charger that is, first of all, cost effective but also small enough to be carried in your pocket,\u201d Myersdorf said. Early examples of the battery, which weighs the same as current smartphone batteries, show a graphic dial on a phone lighting up as the seconds go past before finally reaching full capacity. As the electronics industry is heavily focused on battery charge length \u2013 in everything from tablets to the new generation of wearable tech such as the imminent iWatch \u2013 the advent of any new form of battery attracts major interest. Any debate about the features of a particular smartphone turns inevitably to the longevity of the battery. As phones have expanded from the basic task of making calls and sending texts to filming and screening video clips, the demands on batteries have increased. Users have been advised to turn the screen brightness down, switch to airplane mode and turn off Wi-Fi to save the battery during the day, as well as shutting down apps running in the background However, the new battery itself will not have a prolonged lifespan. The current generation of StoreDot batteries will last about one-third less of the time than those in standard smartphones at the moment. This means that heavy users with a StoreDot battery will probably recharge their phone about once during the day. However, Myersdorf says their research shows that 60% of heavy mobile phone users leave the house with a charger at present anyway. By 2018, StoreDot says that its battery will also outlast current smartphone batteries, which typically last a day, depending on how heavily they are used. If a manufacturer adopts StoreDot technology, it will add just over \u00a330 to the bill for a handset. Talks are taking place with 15 smartphone manufacturers with StoreDot wanting to sign launch agreements with \u201cone or two\u201d by the end of this year. It hopes to have a phone with the battery system in the hands of consumers by Christmas 2016. The system cannot be retrofitted to an existing phone. \u201cThe problem is that there needs to be a sequence of developments which needs to take place in parallel to what StoreDot has done and these are a specially designed smartphone, a specially designed charger which is based on our charger, and a certification of the battery in terms of safety,\u201d says Myersdorf. \u201cFrom our analysis we believe that 30% of the people will pay a little bit more \u2013 roughly $50 (\u00a332) more \u2013 on the phone model if it charges faster. \u201cIf one of the big guys [phone manufacturers] feels that this is a game-changer like we do, they put it on their roadmap. They can make it happen. StoreDot alone cannot make it happen.\u201d The main problem for users adapting to the new system would be to get people used to the idea of charging once during the day, he says. So far, the company has received $48m in funding from a number of investors including Samsung and Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich. The same technology can be used, according to StoreDot, to power up electric vehicles within five minutes. A further investment would allow StoreDot to show they can power a car which would then be able to drive for 150 miles on that five-minute charge, says Myersdorf. Again, compared with rival products the StoreDot car battery would be more expensive although the price will inevitably come down as its popularity increases, he says. The technology can also be used to power brighter computer and smartphone screens. StoreDot aims to penetrate 2% of the smartphone market in the first year after launch and 6% in the second, says Myersdorf. It is a market where well in excess of 1 billion units are sold each and every year, so a solution to dead phone anxiety could prove lucrative.",

They can make it happen. StoreDot alone cannot make it happen.\u201d</p> <p>The main problem for users adapting to the new system would be to get people used to the idea of charging once during the day, he says. So far, the company has received $48m in funding from a number of investors including Samsung and Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich.</p> <p>The same technology can be used, according to StoreDot, to power up electric vehicles within five minutes. <br></p> <p>A further investment would allow StoreDot to show they can power a car which would then be able to drive for 150 miles on that five-minute charge, says Myersdorf. Again, compared with rival products the StoreDot car battery would be more expensive although the price will inevitably come down as its popularity increases, he says.</p> <p>The technology can also be used to power brighter computer and smartphone screens. </p> <p>StoreDot aims to penetrate 2% of the smartphone market in the first year after launch and 6% in the second, says Myersdorf. It is a market where well in excess of 1 billion units are sold each and every year, so a solution to dead phone anxiety could prove lucrative. <br><br></p>",

After the financial crisis struck in 2007-09, they opposed the Keynesian measures necessary to avert a 1930s-style great depression; and when they assumed the reins of office in 2010 they made misleading comparisons between the state of the British economy and that of Greece and introduced wholly unnecessary \u201causterity\u201d measures. These latter not only stopped the burgeoning economic recovery in its tracks: they sapped the animal spirits of entrepreneurs and wrecked any hope of the boost to confidence they were supposed to encourage. There followed several years of \u201cflatlining\u201d and missed investment opportunities in the public and private sectors. In his forensic analysis of \u201cThe Macroeconomic Record of the Coalition Government\u201d (National Institute Economic Review, February 2015) the economist Simon Wren-Lewis compares the total growth of output per capita in the UK from 2010 to 2013 with experience under two previous recoveries from recession, both of which were under Conservative governments. After the collapse of output of some 6-7% engendered by the financial crisis, output per capita grew by \u201cjust under 2%\u201d from 2010 to 2013, whereas in 1981-84 and 1992-95 growth was over 8%. Wren-Lewis comments: \u201cIn short, the performance of the coalition government has been a disaster.\u201d \u201cDisaster\u201d is a strong word from such a rigorous academic as Wren-Lewis, but I fully agree with him and have tried to explain the reasons in my new book, Mr Osborne\u2019s Economic Experiment, which compares austerity during the postwar years 1945-51 with 2010 to \u2026 well, to the end of the decade if the Tories are re-elected and adhere to their plans for a lot more austerity. The key difference between those two periods was that after the second world war there was a chronic shortage of supply of goods in the economy, so taxation and ration books were necessary to keep a lid on demand, whereas following the financial crisis there was plenty of idle supply capacity but a serious shortage of demand. Instead of counteracting the weakness in demand, the coalition took measures to aggravate it. I am not making this up. Which brings us back to the holders of those two great offices of state and the luck of the devil. An unbelievably convenient boost to demand in this country \u2013 and indeed to all economies that are major importers of oil \u2013 has come in the nick of electoral time from the halving of the world price of crude. This, as economists are pointing out, is the equivalent of a major tax cut, neatly timed for the runup to the election, but a tax cut that has nothing whatever to do with policy initiatives on the part of Cameron and Osborne. This does not stop the shameless duo from taking full credit for the manna from heaven, and doing their best to present the resulting boost to the economy as all part of their long-term plan. The truth is that the only long-term plan they have had is to seize the excuse of the putative need for \u201causterity\u201d to shrink the size of the state, in the process imparting serious social damage to the poor. The victims of these policies do not have the kind of voice available to most participants in the economic and social debate; but they do turn up on the doorsteps of the churches. The government, as in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher, has been quick to condemn the Church of England for its criticism, but it is not alone, and Cardinal Vincent Nichols has spoken out on the same issue from time to time. To my mind, ministers protest too much against the publication of the empirical observations of the clergy. There are times when you need turbulent priests. One of the curiosities of the coalition\u2019s approach was the way that, so far from taking advantage of negligible real interest rates to borrow heavily for a once-in-a-lifetime boost to infrastructure spending, they actually cut back on such investment. Suddenly, rather late in the day, they have discovered the need to do something about our northern cities. My old friend, that veteran infrastructure devotee Lord Heseltine, is convinced that the chancellor is serious about this. But when I read about Osborne\u2019s plans to balance the entire budget, including capital expenditure, if the Tories are still calling the shots for the rest of the decade, I cannot reconcile the rhetoric about investment with his increasingly laughable \u201clong-term plan\u201d. By contrast, the opposition proposes, sensibly, to borrow to finance capital expenditure, thereby aiming at a more expansionary policy than intended by Osborne. In which context I was struck recently by a remark made to me by an old Treasury friend, now retired, whom I had always regarded as the fount of orthodoxy and the \u201cTreasury View\u201d (that is, an ultra-cautious approach to spending and borrowing, and the introduction of restrictive measures at the slightest opportunity). \u201cThe government should be taking every opportunity to borrow at zero real interest rates,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cYou should say so.\u201d Well, I think I have from time to time. Meanwhile, no one can really know whether the fortuitous boost from lower oil prices can outweigh in electoral terms the general impression that so many people in this country feel they are just scraping a living, and that the coalition has a lot to answer for.",

The Bank of England has gone into convulsions over the move, as has (rather predictably) the Treasury, while the negative view is also assumed to apply to all City workers \u2013 who tend to believe that as there\u2019s no end to their talents, their pay should be similarly unrestrained. Still, there are more thoughtful bankers who rather welcome the cap, as it has provided the cover of some sort of action on banking pay, while allowing the City an incredibly easy way of ignoring the new rules. All of which might be topical this week, as the banks report results and bonus-pot sizes, just as the EBA gathers to discuss actually making the policy work. The problem has been that, when faced with the new rules stating banks could only pay bonuses of two times salary, the financiers came up with the cunning move of simply, er, rebranding the bonus as an \u201callowance\u201d. This utterly predictable ruse easily outmanoeuvred the EBA, so this week it will attempt to translate into law a legal opinion that \u201callowances\u201d are really bonuses. This time, what could possibly go wrong? Where Lionheart failed, housebuilders succeed It was Richard I who once quipped that he would have sold London if only he could have found a buyer \u2013 but it took eight centuries for that germ of an idea to become government policy. Now, of course, the Lionheart\u2019s project is almost complete, with a sizable chunk of the capital in the hands of shady tycoons who share our heroic monarch\u2019s sketchy knowledge of the English language, as well as his love of spending as much time as possible overseas. But what have they bought? Some housebuilders have started releasing American Psycho-style adverts to flog high-rise flats to City workers, which has only helped fuel fears that the London market is a tad toppy. Still, as we enter a week in which Persimmon, Bovis and Barratt all report numbers, investors are starting to do the unthinkable \u2013 and focus on house prices outside London. When they make contact with the regions, they are finding scores of builders who reckon you\u2019d have to be a complete idiot not to make money in the current environment, thanks to initiatives like Help to Buy \u2013 another age-old property policy that\u2019s handy when you\u2019re out on an election crusade. When the bookie isn\u2019t always the winner For those who like a punt, there\u2019s a full card this week in the world of gambling.

They will be riding horses on ground that is less than good, following the introduction of the new point of consumption tax, which charges bookies for profits made from UK punters, even though their websites have long moved offshore.
