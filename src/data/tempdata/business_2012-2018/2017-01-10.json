      "bodyText": "A tentative pickup in the global economy this year is at risk from the political uncertainty unleashed by Brexit and the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House, the World Bank has said. The Washington-based organisation said 2016 had been the weakest year for the global economy since the deep recession of 2008-09 and expressed concern that protectionist pressures would continue to increase unless the pace of activity picked up. Announcing the findings of its annual Global Economic Prospects (GEP), the bank said global growth had failed to meet its forecast every year since 2011. A sluggish performance by the US and recessions in large commodity-dependent economies kept expansion in the world economy to 2.3%, down from 2.7% in 2015. The Bank said it expected a return to that level in 2017, adding that the tax cuts and public investment Trump has promised might result in faster growth. It stressed, however, that the impact of the president-elect\u2019s fiscal boost could be offset by the aggressive trade policies he pledged during his election campaign. \u201cThe heightened level of policy uncertainty, especially regarding trade, has been exacerbated by recent political developments \u2013 most notably in the United States and the United Kingdom\u201d, the GEP said. \u201cThis and other risks \u2013 particularly financial market disruptions amid tighter global financing conditions \u2013 may be amplified over time by mounting protectionist tendencies, slower potential growth and elevated vulnerabilities in some emerging markets and developing countries.\u201d The World Bank said it had revised its growth forecasts for the UK in both 2017 and 2018 sharply down, despite the stronger than expected performance of the economy since the Brexit vote last June. It left its 2016 UK growth forecast unchanged at 2%, but said it now expected the economy to expand by 1.2% this year and 1.3% in 2018, comparedwith the 2.1% predicted for both years before the referendum. The Bank believes the uncertainty caused when the UK starts the two-year process of leaving the EU will increasingly weigh on both business and consumer confidence, with investment and spending decisions put off. It said, however, that events in the US would have a much bigger impact on the global economy. \u201cBecause of the outsized role the United States plays in the world economy, changes in policy direction may have global ripple effects. More expansionary US fiscal policies could lead to stronger growth in the United States and abroad over the near-term, but changes to trade or other policies could offset those gains,\u201d said the World Bank\u2019s director for development prospects, Ayhan Kose. Rising oil prices are expected to help lift three leading commodity exporters \u2013 Brazil, Russia and Nigeria \u2013 from recession in 2017. Growth in advanced countries is predicted to rise from 1.6% to 1.8% as a result of a stronger US performance. \u201cAfter years of disappointing global growth, we are encouraged to see stronger economic prospects on the horizon,\u201d the bank\u2019s president, Jim Yong Kim, said. \u201cNow is the time to take advantage of this momentum and increase investments in infrastructure and people. This is vital to accelerating the sustainable and inclusive economic growth required to end extreme poverty.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s idea for a maximum wage cap has been branded unworkable, but the Labour leader\u2019s focus on tackling the pay gap between bosses and workers was given a warmer reception by campaigners against inequality. Major companies are on alert to attacks on boardroom pay after Theresa May put the issue on the agenda during her campaign to become Conservative party leader and prime minister in the wake of the vote for Brexit. A consultation paper published in November, however, was criticised for not taking bold enough action to clamp down on boardroom excess. The intervention by the Labour leader is an indication that the issue remains on the agenda, experts said. Oliver Parry, head of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cBoards must see today\u2019s suggestion as a warning of things to come if they do not show they can moderate directors\u2019 remuneration.\u201d But, he said, Corbyn\u2019s suggestion for a maximum pay cap was a \u201cnon-starter\u201d. \u201cPoliticians simply do not know the right level of pay for the heads of multinational companies, and no successful economy operates with this level of intervention by government,\u201d he added. David Blanchflower, who used to advise Labour and is a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, said the idea was \u201ctotally unworkable\u201d and a \u201clunatic idea\u201d. After raising the idea of a \u201cmaximum wage cap\u201d in an interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Corbyn later turned his focus to other ideas to tackling pay inequality. Corbyn said company bosses wanting to be eligible to bid for government contracts should have their pay limited to less than 20 times that of their lowest-paid worker. This would put a cap on the pay of the chief executives of such companies at \u00a3262,000 if measured against the \u00a313,104 national living wage. Stefan Stern, head of the High Pay Centre, said a general focus on pay ratios helped tackle the issue of inequality. Data from the High Pay Centre shows that leading bosses now typically earn 129 times more than their employees. Stern has tried to work towards a \u201c40 times club\u201d of FTSE 100 companies, in which executives earned no more than 40 times the average salary of their employees. But Stern said finding companies where the pay ratio was this low, closer to where it was in the 1990s, was difficult. Vast numbers of companies bid for government contracts from consultancies \u2013 such as Deliotte which was embroiledin a row over its warning over Brexit last November \u2013 and major outsourcing companies such as G4S and Capita. G4S, whose chief executive received more \u00a32m last year, pointed out that contracts from central government contributed to only around 5% of its overall sales. \u201cOur pay rates reflect the global nature of our business, with over 85% of revenue generated outside the UK,\u201d said G4S, which runs prisons and runs services to house asylum seekers in the UK. The fund management industry \u2013 which gets a vote on executive pay \u2013 has also been considering ways to tackle ballooning boardroom remuneration. Leon Kamhi, head of responsibility at fund managers Hermes, said remuneration committees at individual companies should set out a maximum possible pay for their chief executives. Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs, a free market thinktank, said Corbyn\u2019s ideas had moved from \u201cmisguided to simply muddled\u201d and branded the idea for a maximum wage cap to tackle inequality as \u201cdangerous and, for all intents and purposes, a 100% income tax rate\u201d. \u201cPay ratios are sector discriminatory. A 20:1 ratio would have much less of an effect at a hedge fund than it would on a regular company, which is doubtful the intended consequence. Controlling wealth accumulation is a race to the bottom \u2013 the Labour leader would do better to focus on poverty alleviation rather than pay intervention.\u201d The Adam Smith Institute, which also promotes unfettered markets, was also dismissive. Sam Bowman, executive director, said: \u201cA maximum salary cap would hurt British firms and ultimately ordinary British workers. If you\u2019re a worker for a FTSE 100 firm, this is bad news: your job security and wages will suffer if your company isn\u2019t led by the best people in the world. \u201cIf you\u2019re saving for a pension, this is bad news: the value of your savings will suffer as British firms become less productive, starved of global top talent. If you rely on the NHS or other public services, this is bad news: tax revenues will fall as these highly-paid executives move abroad.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "While the FTSE 100 was breaking new records, European markets were more subdued but still managed to end the day in positive territory, for the most part. The final scores showed: Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.17% to 11,583.30 France\u2019s Cac closed up just 0.01% at 4888.23 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.33% to 19,424.19 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.43% at 9452.0 In the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 42 points or 0.2% at 19,929, heading back towards the 20,000 barrier. Meanwhile after its recent falls, the pound is currently flat against the dollar at $1.2160 and up 0.1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1511. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The FTSE 100 has closed at a record high for the ninth day running, breaking a record which has stood for nearly 20 years. The index finished up 0.53% at a new peak of 7275.47, bettering the eight day winning streak recorded in May 1997 as Tony Blair\u2019s Labour won the general election. The FTSE 250 has closed at 18,413, also a record high. As markets continue to climb - the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now in positive territory and just under 60 points away from the 20,000 level - Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: The FTSE 100 has again had an outstanding day, with the index gaining from the first minute to the last as it reached new all-time highs once more. The fact that we are seeing the index hit these new highs in such a fearless manner says a lot about the potential for further gains. Interestingly we have seen both [President elect] Trump and [UK prime minister} May providing positive news for the respective US and UK indices, yet for very different reasons. While Trump has boosted US stocks by setting out a positive outlook for the future, the strength of the FTSE has been largely down to the pound devaluation associated with fears over a hard Brexit outcome. Back with the markets, and the FTSE 100 is well on course to break two records - a new closing peak and the longest run of closing highs. With a winning streak of nine consecutive end-of-day peaks, this would beat the previous record set in May 1997. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With the pound still at 2 month to 10 week lows (even if it did manage to shrink much of today\u2019s losses), the miners boosted by data from China [factory gate inflation] and the supermarkets led higher by Morrisons impressive Christmas performance the FTSE has plenty of support this Tuesday..[This] sees the index set to break the record for most consecutive days of new all-time closing highs, a record that has lasted for just shy of 20 years. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is giving a speech on Brexit and my colleague Andrew Sparrow is covering it in the politics live blog: As investors await the US reporting season to see if company results justify the heady heights the stock market has reached, leading shares have edged lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which came perilously close to the elusive 20,000 barrier on Friday, has shied further away from that level. It is currently down 27 points or 0.13% at 19,860. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both slipped marginally at the open. Back in the markets, the pound has pulled out of today\u2019s slide and is now flat against the US dollar at $1.217. It\u2019s still down slightly against the euro though, at \u20ac1.149. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the recovery could be temporary... Monday was a bit like Deja-Vu for currency traders, and a keen reminder of how politics can play havoc with a currency. Sterling declined to its lowest level since October as political fears and the Brexit premium started to bite. The pound has managed to claw back some losses on Tuesday, but it remains at risk from a further decline in sentiment. This year\u2019s Davos will certainly be different, thanks to the Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. Attendees will be pondering whether populist forces will triumph in elections in Germany, France and the Netherlands this year, and president Trump\u2019s views on climate change, financial regulation and global inequality. So it\u2019s no surprise that Klaus Schwab, who created WEF decades ago, is no fan of populism. But, of course, those \u2018populist\u2019 forces are no fans of Davos either! CNBC\u2019s Matt Clinch has a good take: In a nod to this current mood, this year\u2019s World Economic Forum (WEF) is titled \u201cResponsive and Responsible Leadership\u201d and its official agenda describes a \u201cweakening of multiple systems\u201d that has eroded confidence and speaks of a possible \u201cdownward spiral\u201d fuelled by protectionism, populism and nativism. Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration as U.S. president on January 20 will overshadow the event but it\u2019s hard to see how every conference, bilateral meeting or roundtable in Davos won\u2019t include some reference to this political upheaval, which the conservative news aggregation site The Drudge Report calls the \u201cnew, new world order\u201d. Indeed, some critics have attacked the event itself as being a reason why U.S. citizens started to question globalization and contemplate the negative impacts it\u2019s had on some parts of Western nations. CNBC: The \u2018party of Davos\u2019 wakes up to the new, new world order Bloomberg\u2019s Matthew Campbell and Albertina Torsoli agree that China will be one of the big issues at WEF next week. They explain: The most high-profile guest by far will be Chinese president Xi Jinping, the first sitting Chinese leader to attend the event. He\u2019s heading a larger-than-ever delegation of business executives from the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, underscoring China\u2019s determination to assume a global leadership role as other major powers are hobbled by domestic infighting. China\u2019s two richest citizens, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. founder Jack Ma and Dalian Wanda Group Co. Ltd CEO Wang Jianlin, will join him and appear in solo on-stage interviews. China\u2019s deepening engagement with the world will, meanwhile, be the subject of a discussion on \u201cChina\u2019s Role for Global Prosperity,\u201d in which stock-market regulator Fang Xinghai and state-assets chief Xiao Yaqing will appear alongside Lloyds of London Chief Executive Officer Inga Beale. More here: Chinese president Xi\u2019s first visit to Davos, next week, is an important opportunity to strengthen relations between China and the rest of the world, says argues WEF founder Klaus Schwab. Schwab tells the WEF press conference that Xi Jinping will attend with a set of top officials and businesspeople, at a time when its economic power is as important as ever. Since I first visited China in 1979, we have developed a very close relationship, close presence in China. We are all aware that we are now in transition to a multi-polar geo-political and geo-economic structure. China will equal the United States soon for economic power. And I foresee that President Xi will show how China will assume a responsive and responsible leadership role in global affairs. Schwab also reiterates that populism won\u2019t make the world a better place. We are living in a very complex world. All the issues are interrelated.... There are no simple answers to the challenges that we have. So what we have to do in Davos is show how complicated the situation is. Over in Davos, the World Economic Forum are getting ready for their 47th annual meeting, which begins next Monday. A lot has happened around the world since the 46th get-together, and much will have shocked the CEOs, government leaders and other heavy-hitters who trek to the ski resort each year. WEF founder Klaus Schwab and colleagues are holding a pre-meeting press conference now (it\u2019s online here). Schwab says this year\u2019s meeting must make progress towards tackling the world\u2019s problems - and argued that the rising tide of populism isn\u2019t the answer. Every simplified approach to deal with the global complex agenda is condemned to fail. We cannot just have populist solutions. The problems we face technologically, economically, socially and politically are so tremendous, such that sustainable solutions requite a systemic, holistic approach....and particularly the collaboration of all global stakeholders, united in one mission - improving the state of the world. Schwab also singled out the challenge created by the Fourth Industrial Revolution (the new wave of automation and robotics), and pointed out that Chinese premier President Xi Jinping will address Davos for the first time. Over in Italy, two people have been arrested for allegedly hacking into the email accounts of European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, former prime ministers Matteo Renzi and Mario Monti, and thousands of others. We don\u2019t know what information was obtained, or what it was used for, but it will only intensify the focus on cybersecurity. Reuters has the details: \u201cThere were tens of thousands of email accounts hacked, and among them were accounts belonging to bankers, businessmen and even several cardinals in the Vatican,\u201d Roberto Di Legami, director of the specialised cyber police unit that conducted the investigation, told Reuters. Police have sequestered a server in Rome containing thousands of files, but 99 percent of the data was stored in the United States, Di Legami said. The information will be shipped back in coming days but it will take some time before it can be analysed. While the FTSE 100 hits fresh highs, the pound is on track for its worst three-day run sin October. Sterling is now down 0.2% at $1.214, adding to Monday\u2019s 1% slide, and keeping it at a 10-week low against the US dollar. It\u2019s also at two-month lows against the euro, down 0.25% at \u20ac1.147. These aren\u2019t big moves, of course, but it does bring the pound rather close to its weakest level against the dollar since the alarming \u2018flash crash\u2019 of early October, which is $1.2080. This chart from City expert David Jones shows how the pound\u2019s rally in November has now unravelled: Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, says the uncertainty around Brexit is overshadowing the fact that UK economic data has been better than expected. He writes: \u201cThe pound\u2019s lowly performance this week took a sharper hit, reaching fresh 10-week-lows, owing largely to dimming hopes for a \u2018soft\u2019 Brexit. The key issue being the taut stance of EU over free-movement and its effect on the prospects of a single market access deal for the U.K. Selling pressure on the pound is expected to stay until further details are revealed in the coming weeks. On the bright side, the economy is still defying expectations as it continues to persist on the momentum from 2016 and a lower pound has positively affected exports. Modest economic growth figures ideally mean that the BoE cannot afford to increase interest rates anytime in the near future \u2013 such indicators normally strengthen the pound, however, the Brexit clamour seems to be the sole driver of the current narrative.\u201d Incidentally, the FTSE 100 could also set its longest run of daily gains since 2009 today -- as well as the lengthiest stretch of record highs ever. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is on track to post its longest run of record highs since it was created in 1984. After another morning of gains, the blue-chip index is up 30 points at 7268, an new intraday high. Partly thanks to the weak pound, the FTSE has closed at a record high for the last eight days running. It\u2019s gained 8% since the start of December: So if the rally holds, the FTSE 100 will close at a record high for the ninth day running. This would smash the previous record set in 1997 after Tony Blair won a landslide general election victory. Mining companies are now leading the rally, helped by optimism about economic growth next year. The strong Christmas trading figures from Morrison\u2019s are pushing supermarkets shares higher too. Here\u2019s some more snippets from the parliamentary hearing on Brexit and the City, via Financial News\u2019s Lucy McNulty: Over in parliament, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange has warned that thousands of City jobs could be lost if the uncertainty around Brexit doesn\u2019t ease. Xavier Rolet told the Treasury committee that LSE clients wouldn\u2019t wait for clarity about Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. He said: \u201cI\u2019m not just talking about the clearing jobs themselves which number into the few thousands. But the very large array of ancillary functions, whether it\u2019s syndication, trading, treasury management, middle office, back office, risk management, software, which range into far more than just a few thousand or tens of thousands of jobs. They would then start migrating.\u201d (thanks to Ben Woods of the Press Association for the quotes). HSBC chairman Douglas Flint is also talking about clients\u2019 concerns about Brexit. We\u2019ll have more on this shortly... Food inflation is returning to the UK, and the weak pound is partly to blame. Research group Kantar Worldpanel has reported that grocery prices rose by 0.2% in the 12 weeks to 1 January, the first time in just over two years that food prices have gone up. The cost of importing foodstuffs like sugar and chocolate into the UK has risen since sterling slumped against other currencies. And one of the country\u2019s largest food producers, Premier Foods, is now in talks to hike prices. It\u2019s bad news for fans of Mr Kipling cakes, Ambrosia custard and Loyd Grossman\u2019s sauces. City AM reported overnight that Premier was talking to Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda due to \u201cgrowing cost pressures from the weaker pound in the wake of the EU referendum\u201d. A spokeswoman has now confirmed that negotations are underway, saying: \u201cThe situation on pricing differs between our different categories and brands and is currently under discussion with our individual retail customer. On average we are considering rises around the midsingle digit mark.\u201d The swingometer has been a staple of British current affair since the 1950s. And analysts at HSBC have created their own version, the \u2018Brexometer\u2019 to show whether the City is expecting a hard or soft Brexit. Today\u2019s weakening pound suggests we\u2019re heading towards a rather solid exit (losing full access to the single market, and no longer subject to the free movement of people, capital, goods and services). Connor Campbell of SpreadEx predicts more sterling volatility today: The prospect of Jeremy Corbyn set to deliver a speech claiming the UK can be better off out of the EU meaning it might be another rough day for the pound. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to give a major speech on Europe today that will outline his vision for Britain after Brexit. Our political editor Anushka Asthana explains: Jeremy Corbyn will use his first speech of 2017 to claim that Britain can be better off outside the EU and insist that the Labour party has no principled objection to ending the free movement of European workers in the UK. Setting out his party\u2019s pitch on Brexit in the year that Theresa May will trigger article 50, the Labour leader will also reach for the language of leave campaigners by promising to deliver on a pledge to spend millions of pounds extra on the NHS every week. He will say Labour\u2019s priority in EU negotiations will remain full access to the European single market, but that his party wants \u201cmanaged migration\u201d and to repatriate powers from Brussels that would allow governments to intervene in struggling industries such as steel. Sources suggested that the economic demands were about tariff-free access to the single market, rather than membership that they argued did not exist. Karl Whelan, Professor of Economics at University College Dublin, tweets that this call for immigration control but full access to the single market seems familiar.... The Financial Times argues today that \u201cexasperation\u201d over Theresa May\u2019s lack of clarity about Brexit are doing the real damage to sterling. Traders aren\u2019t surprised that Britain is likely to leave the single market, to allow new controls on immigration, but they are uncomfortable in the dark waiting for more details. Here\u2019s a flavour: With less than three months to go before the government plans to invoke Article 50 and begin the Brexit process, there is nervousness that the government has yet to reveal a plan. \u201cThere is no clear path and a lack of substance,\u201d said Andrew Soper, head of FX options at Nomura. More here: Traders fret over Theresa May\u2019s Brexit vagueness The pound is continuing to drop. It just hit a new 10-week low of $1.2118 against the US dollar, down another half a cent this morning. Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit a new all-time high at the start of trading. The index of the largest companies listed in London gained 23 points, or 0.3%, to hit 7261 points. That\u2019s partly due to the pound\u2019s weakness, which boosts the value of international companies and should help exporters. A strong performance by the supermarket sector is also helping, after Morrisons posted its best sales results in seven years. Morrison\u2019s share are up 4%, with rivals Sainsbury and Tesco close behind. On Monday night the FTSE 100 hit a record closing high for the 8th day in a row. That last happened in 1997 -- a ninth consecutive closing high today would break that record. Despite Theresa May\u2019s best efforts, the pound is under renewed pressure this morning as investors fret about Brexit. Sterling has fallen by 0.3% against the euro to \u20ac1.1466 in early trading, its lowest level since the 10th November. The pound is also a little weaker against the US dollar at $1.2137, adding to Monday\u2019s losses (when it hit a three-month low against the greenback). The PM claimed on Monday that Britain will get the best possible deal from the EU. However, her insistence that the UK can\u2019t keep \u2018bits of membership\u2019 have fuelled worries about a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit (not a term Mrs May approves of), and exit from the single market. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the pound was \u2018battered\u2019 on Monday. She predicts that investors will keep betting against sterling until they know the details of Brexit. We expect the pound to remain the most volatile of the G10 currencies in the coming months while we wait for the triggering of Article 50. Essentially the market is likely to re-establish shorts in GBP, after a brief respite at the end of last year, until it is quite confident that Brexit won\u2019t be \u2018hard\u2019 or disastrous for the UK economy. While Theresa May says that we can\u2019t keep \u2018bits of the EU\u2019, sterling isn\u2019t safe from the bears until we know what will replace the single market. Any potential recovery in the pound be scuppered by \u201cheightened levels of political risk\u201d, she adds. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re getting a new healthcheck on Britain\u2019s economy this morning, with results from supermarket chain Wm Morrison and retailer Majestic Wine. The early signs are encouraging, with Morrison\u2019s posting its best sales growth since 2009 - up 2.9% over the crucial Christmas period. That suggests UK consumer confidence is holding up, although Morrison\u2019s new management team should take the credit too. Majestic says its retail outlets had their biggest ever Christmas too, with like-for-like sales up 7.5%. So, Britain hasn\u2019t lost its appetite for wine - and after 2016, who can blame us? More on all that shortly.... Also coming up today Three City chiefs will be grilled by MPs about Brexit this morning. Douglas Flint of HSBC, Elizabeth Corley of Allianz Global Investors and Xavier Rolet of the London Stock Exchange are due before the Treasury committee at 10am. And City traders will be watching to see Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 can maintain its run of record highs.",

      "bodyText": "Brexit poses a risk to the global financial system and could spark more than 230,000 job losses, senior City figures have told MPs as they called for clarity on the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU. Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, said Brexit could have an impact on \u201cunimaginably large\u201d contracts which are cleared through the City and which might need to be transferred to the 27 remaining EU member states or other financial centres. As Rolet called for a five-year transition period for the UK to exit the EU, MPs on the Treasury select committee were told the triggering of article 50 \u2013 the formal process initiating departure from the EU \u2013 in March could prompt banks to implement contingency plans to shift business out of London. \u201cThe ecosystem in London is a bit like a Jenga tower: you don\u2019t know if you pull one small piece out whether nothing happens or whether it has a more dramatic impact,\u201d said Douglas Flint, chairman of Britain\u2019s biggest bank, HSBC. Ahead of the 23 June referendum HSBC said it could move 1,000 roles to Paris and Flint told MPs the bank was ready to take \u201cpre-emptive action\u201d before Brexit was completed. He pointed out that HSBC also had operations in Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The outcome of the referendum has prompted European centres to make a pitch for the daily \u00a3440bn of business that is cleared through the City, largely through the London Clearing House, which is operated by the LSE. Rolet said the business was more likely to shift to New York than other European centres and called for a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with the incoming Donald Trump administration to resolve the matter. If the City did lose its ability to clear transactions denominated in euros \u2013 which was a contentious issue even before the Brexit vote \u2013 Rolet said 232,000 roles could be lost, citing research by consultants Ernst &amp; Young for the LSE. That report has also been referred to by peers who said last month that thousands of jobs could be lost unless a transition deal could be secured for the UK. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers\u2019 Association, said last year that banks were \u201cquivering over the relocate button\u201d. When asked about this, Flint said: \u201cNobody wants to push the button. The best outcome for everybody is the preservation of the status quo insofar as possible.\u201d He said it depended on the bank\u2019s business model. Banks like HSBC which had operations in Europe \u201ccan take even longer to push the button,\u201d Flint said, Citibank, he said, had a licence in Ireland but other banks operated in the EU through their London licence and might need to act sooner. Flint said that some US banks in London were able to transact with big European companies because they used a \u201cpassport\u201d from their operations in the UK and were devising contingency plans. Those which did not have access to Europe would start to implement those \u201cpretty much immediately on the triggering of article 50,\u201d said Flint. Rolet said he was concerned about the \u201csystemic impact\u201d of moving contracts that are guaranteed by the London Clearing House if it was handled too quickly. The City has been calling for a longer period of transition to prepare for exit from the EU. Asked about this, Rolet said: \u201cTwo years is just too short.\u201dA further three years after the two years of negotiation is needed, he added. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said: \u201cThe unanimity among these leading City figures \u2013 about the need for a three-year \u2018standstill\u2019 at the end of the article 50 process \u2013 is significant. They argued that without such an arrangement, major banks and other financial services firms will take pre-emptive action at a cost, perhaps large, to the sector and the wider economy.\u201d The vote for Brexit has sparked a debate about special deals for certain parts of the economy after carmaker Nissan announced it would develop its Sunderland plant. But Flint disagreed with the assertion by Labour MP Wes Streeting that this would be a bankers\u2019 Brexit. Along with Rolet, and Allianz vice-chair Elizabeth Corley, he called for clarity on the UK\u2019s hopes for Brexit in the eight to 12 weeks remaining before article 50 is set to be triggered.",

      "body": "<p>Brexit poses a risk to the global financial system and could spark more than 230,000 job losses, senior City figures have told MPs as they called for clarity on the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU. <br></p> <p>Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, said Brexit could have an impact on \u201cunimaginably large\u201d contracts which are cleared through the City and which might need to be transferred to the 27 remaining EU member states or other financial centres.</p> <p>As Rolet called for a five-year transition period for the UK to exit the EU, MPs on the Treasury select committee were told the triggering of article 50 \u2013 the formal process initiating departure from the EU \u2013 in March could prompt banks to implement contingency plans to shift business out of London.</p> <p>\u201cThe ecosystem in London is a bit like a Jenga tower: you don\u2019t know if you pull one small piece out whether nothing happens or whether it has a more dramatic impact,\u201d said Douglas Flint, chairman of Britain\u2019s biggest bank, HSBC. </p> <p>Ahead of the 23 June referendum HSBC said it could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/15/uk-better-in-reformed-europe-says-hsbc-chair\">move 1,000 roles to Paris</a> and Flint told MPs the bank was ready to take \u201cpre-emptive action\u201d before Brexit was completed. He pointed out that HSBC also had operations in Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.</p> <p>The outcome of the referendum has prompted European centres to make a pitch for the daily \u00a3440bn of business that is cleared through the City, largely through the London Clearing House, which is operated by the LSE. Rolet said the business was more likely to shift to New York than other European centres and called for a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with the incoming Donald Trump administration to resolve the matter.</p> <p>If the City did lose its ability to clear transactions denominated in euros \u2013 which was a contentious issue even before the Brexit vote \u2013 Rolet said 232,000 roles could be lost, citing research by consultants Ernst &amp; Young for the LSE. That report has also been referred to by peers who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/13/urgent-brexit-deal-needed-to-avert-banking-job-losses-peers-to-warn\">said last month</a> that thousands of jobs could be lost unless a transition deal could be secured for the UK. </p> <p>Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers\u2019 Association, said last year that banks were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/22/leading-banks-set-to-pull-out-of-brexit-uk\">quivering over the relocate button</a>\u201d. When asked about this, Flint said: \u201cNobody wants to push the button. The best outcome for everybody is the preservation of the status quo insofar as possible.\u201d</p> <p>He said it depended on the bank\u2019s business model. Banks like HSBC which had operations in Europe \u201ccan take even longer to push the button,\u201d Flint said, Citibank, he said, had a licence in Ireland but other banks operated in the EU through their London licence and might need to act sooner.</p> <p>Flint said that some US banks in London were able to transact with big European companies because they used a \u201cpassport\u201d from their operations in the UK and were devising contingency plans. Those which did not have access to Europe would start to implement those \u201cpretty much immediately on the triggering of article 50,\u201d said Flint.</p> <p>Rolet said he was concerned about the \u201csystemic impact\u201d of moving contracts that are guaranteed by the London Clearing House if it was handled too quickly. </p> <p>The City has been calling for a longer period of transition to prepare for exit from the EU. Asked about this, Rolet said: \u201cTwo years is just too short.\u201dA further three years after the two years of negotiation is needed, he added. </p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said: \u201cThe unanimity among these leading City figures \u2013 about the need for a three-year \u2018standstill\u2019 at the end of the article 50 process \u2013 is significant. They argued that without such an arrangement, major banks and other financial services firms will take pre-emptive action at a cost, perhaps large, to the sector and the wider economy.\u201d</p> <p><em> </em>The vote for Brexit has sparked a debate about special deals for certain parts of the economy after carmaker Nissan announced it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/new-nissan-super-plant-hopes-for-tariff-free-eu-access\">develop its Sunderland plant</a>. But Flint disagreed with the assertion by Labour MP Wes Streeting that this would be a bankers\u2019 Brexit. Along with Rolet, and Allianz vice-chair Elizabeth Corley, he called for clarity on the UK\u2019s hopes for Brexit in the eight to 12 weeks remaining before article 50 is set to be triggered.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Did Jeremy Corbyn spell out how it might work? The Labour leader\u2019s remarks appeared to be off the cuff in his morning interviews, but by his Peterborough speech it had become a formal policy. Labour would not offer public contracts to any firm that paid the boss more than 20 times the wage of its lowest-paid worker. That\u2019s considerably weaker \u2013 but probably more practical \u2013 than legislating for a maximum wage, a policy Corbyn\u2019s own former economic adviser Danny Blanchflower described as \u201cidiotic\u201d. Corbyn also floated other ways of using the government\u2019s power to influence corporate behaviour, including a \u201ckitemark\u201d for companies whose remuneration policies had government approval, or a preferential tax system to reward them. Why is Corbyn saying this now? Corbyn\u2019s apparently unscripted proposal was the first clear example of a new year Labour relaunch. With his poll ratings grim, Corbyn\u2019s advisers have decided to take a new, more populist approach. They want to emphasise the Labour leader\u2019s credentials as an anti-establishment figure who has never signed up to what they see as a malign post-Thatcherite consensus, which led Labour and Conservative governments to deregulate business and privatise state assets in the belief it was the best thing for Britain\u2019s economy. While using public procurement is a far narrower and more limited approach than a salary cap, it could still bite hard for consultants bidding for taxpayer-funded contracts, for example. Would the policy work? Corbyn\u2019s response to questioning on the radio was less a worked-out policy than a howl of outrage. He believes many voters share his fury that highly paid corporate executives emerged all but unscathed from the financial crisis that plunged Britain into recession. In response to questioning after his speech, he stressed that hospitals and schools require the hard work of everyone \u2013 from cleaners to headteachers and consultants \u2013 to be successful. But the policies he floated fell well short of a maximum pay law and came closer to Ed Miliband-style reformism than to a populist leftwing revolt. However, as with some of Donald Trump\u2019s most eye-catching policies, Corbyn\u2019s team hopes what the public will take away is not the nitty gritty detail, but the fact that Corbyn is willing to take on fat cats \u2013 and the political establishment. What is the state of high pay in the UK? Sir Martin Sorrell, of the advertising agency WPP, was the highest paid chief executive of a FTSE 100 company in 2015, earning \u00a370.4m. By contrast, the median annual gross pay in the UK in 2016 was \u00a323,099. Workers in banking, excluding insurance and pension funding, have the highest average pay, with workers in the 90th percentile earning \u00a3111,183. However, the financial services industry also has the greatest disparity between median earnings and high pay, as median wages were \u00a335,793 in 2016. Has the gap between the average worker and the highest paid grown? The gap between the pay of the average worker and CEOs has widened in FTSE 100 companies in the past decade. This year 4 January was the date on which the average FTSE 100 CEO\u2019s pay overtook the earnings of the average worker for the year. Some companies in effect cap the pay of their highest earners by setting an earnings multiple based on average pay within the company. In 2004 the average multiple was 94, meaning the highest paid staff earned 94 times that of the average worker in the company. By 2014 that figure had soared to 150. Sorrell\u2019s pay amounted to 1,444 times that of the average worker at the company. The average estimated pay of the Manchester United captain, Wayne Rooney, is \u00a313.5m, while the average annual earnings per player at Manchester United in 2016 was \u00a35.7m, according to the latest Global Sports Salaries Survey.",

However, the financial services industry also has the greatest disparity between median earnings and high pay, as median wages were \u00a335,793 in 2016.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2017-01-10T12:28:27/embed.html\" data-alt=\"In 2014, FTSE 100 CEOs were paid the equivalent of 150 average employees' wages.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jan/2017-01-10T12:28:27/embed.html\">In 2014, FTSE 100 CEOs were paid the equivalent of 150 average employees' wages.</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Has the gap between the average worker and the highest paid grown?</strong></h2> <p>The gap between the pay of the average worker and CEOs has widened in FTSE 100 companies in the past decade.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Two-thirds of female fast food workers at restaurants operated by Andrew Puzder, Donald Trump\u2019s controversial nomination for US labor secretary, experienced sexual harassment at work, a rate much higher than the industry average, a stinging advocacy survey has claimed. Many female workers, according to the research conducted by Restaurant Opportunities Center (Roc) United, have been harassed by customers referencing the highly sexualised advertising campaigns Puzder has championed as CEO of CKE Restaurants, the parent company of chains including Carl\u2019s Jr and Hardee\u2019s. \u201cCustomers have asked why I don\u2019t dress like the women in the commercials,\u201d one Tennessee-based Hardee\u2019s employee told researchers. \u201cI continually get notes left on tables from customers, customers flirt or ask me out,\u201d said another Carl\u2019s Jr employee in California. \u201cI have also been followed outside the store by customers.\u201d Puzder, CEO of the billion-dollar company since 2000, has staunchly defended his company\u2019s notorious advertising that often features scantily dressed women eating burgers in scenes some have compared to pornography, arguing in 2011: \u201cWe believe in putting hot models in our commercials, because ugly ones don\u2019t sell burgers.\u201d The rate of sexual harassment across the fast food industry is already high, with 40% of female workers reporting some form of unwanted contact, according to recent polling. But researchers at Roc United, a dedicated nonprofit that advocates for restaurant workers\u2019 rights, argued the 66% reporting rate found among CKE employees was \u201cdisturbing\u201d. Puzder, who has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Trump campaign and the Republican party, is also an outspoken critic of increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 and the expansion of rights to overtime pay. CKE Restaurants has settled a number of multimillion-dollar class action lawsuits brought by employees in relation to pay and conditions and, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, were subject to similar class actions cases in California years later. The Roc United study of employees also found that close to a third of the 564 workers surveyed had experienced a form of wage theft, such as failed overtime payments, inadequate work breaks and performing multiple duties without adequate compensation. Of workers surveyed in California, where the majority of the sample was taken from, 32% said they were not given meal breaks after working more than five hours, a violation of the state\u2019s strict worker\u2019s break laws; 79% of survey respondents said they had served or prepared food while they were sick. \u201cI was constantly pressured to cut labor costs \u2013 this meant that employees were stressed out and customer service suffered because there weren\u2019t enough employees working on my shifts,\u201d Abel Gonzalez, a 42-year-old Carl\u2019s Jr employee in Los Angeles, told researchers. CKE Restaurants did not respond to a request for comment on the research findings, but Elizabeth Johnson, a spokeswoman for the president-elect\u2019s transition team who was not contacted by the Guardian, sent an emailed statement, dismissing the report as \u201cfake news\u201d that was \u201cpaid for by unions and special interests opposed to Andy Puzder\u2019s nomination\u201d. Johnson accused the union of \u201cattempting to smear\u201d Puzder by using \u201cleading questions and deceitful surveying tactics, such as posing as CKE corporate representatives\u201d. The spokeswoman provided no evidence for the allegations. Jayaraman, the director of the Food Labor Research Center at University of California, Berkeley, dismissed Johnson\u2019s claims as \u201claughable\u201d and false. \u201cClearly they don\u2019t know how survey research is done,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no way for us to pose as anything when we\u2019re asking staff to voluntarily fill out a survey online.\u201d Roc United researchers also interviewed CKE staff members at stores in four states and, Jayaraman said, identified themselves as researchers before commencing with surveys as well as identifying employees through online social media. The academic said the sample size of 564, taken from states across the US, was more than enough to draw conclusions about entire workforce of over 20,000. \u201cWhen we are looking to do research on a whole metropolitan area, like New York City or Los Angeles,\u201d Jayaraman said, \u201c500 is the survey number we use to understand how working conditions in a whole metropolitan area, and bearing in mind you\u2019re talking about 10 million people and 200,000, 300,000.\u201d On Tuesday afternoon, current and former employees of Carl\u2019s Jr and Hardee\u2019s spoke for nearly two hours before a panel of convened by Senate Democrats about the poor working conditions and wages at the fast food chains under Puzder\u2019s ownership. During the emotional testimony, one woman described the hardships of raising six children on a salary of only $8.75 an hour after seven years. \u201cI work almost every day and am still considered poor,\u201d Lupe Guzman said, who displayed a framed photograph of her children on the table next to her. She added: \u201cPeople like Andrew Puzder don\u2019t see how regular Americans are living day to day.\u201d Laura McDonald, a former general manager at Carl\u2019s Jr, who is part of a class action lawsuit against CKE concerning overtime pay, said she couldn\u2019t think of \u201canyone less qualified\u201d to run the Department of Labor, an agency that has traditionally existed to protect workers. \u201cHe never protected the employees at CKE when he was in charge so I don\u2019t think he would be the person to protect American workers\u2019 rights,\u201d McDonald said. Democrats have identified Puzder as one of eight nominees who say have particularly \u201ctroublesome\u201d backgrounds. The fast food CEO is an opponent of efforts to raise the minimum wage, a movement that is largely led by industry workers. He is also a critic of sick leave policies and supports repealing the Affordable Care Act. Democrats and labor leaders have argued that his appointment is akin to letting the fox guard the henhouse, and cannot be trusted to protect workers\u2019 interests. \u201cThis is not right,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat of Massachusetts said as Guzman spoke about the difficulty of raising a family on a minimum wage salary. \u201cThis is what the secretary of labor is supposed to stand up for - is people like you. We\u2019re here to start the real inquiry about whether or not Mr Puzder is a person who can be trusted to stand up for you and all of the workers of America.\u201d",

But researchers at Roc United, a dedicated nonprofit that advocates for restaurant workers\u2019 rights, argued the 66% reporting rate found among CKE employees was \u201cdisturbing\u201d. </p> <p>Puzder, who has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Trump campaign and the Republican party, is also an outspoken critic of increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 and the expansion of rights to overtime pay. CKE Restaurants has settled a number of multimillion-dollar class action lawsuits brought by employees <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/12/08/andrew-puzder-labor-secretary-nominee/95172276/\">in relation to pay and conditions</a> and, according to a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/919628/000091962812000011/cke-11052012x10q.htm\">recent filing</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission, were subject to similar class actions cases in California years later. </p> <p>The Roc United study of employees also found that close to a third of the 564 workers surveyed had experienced a form of wage theft, such as failed overtime payments, inadequate work breaks and performing multiple duties without adequate compensation. </p> <p>Of workers surveyed in California, where the majority of the sample was taken from, 32% said they were not given meal breaks after working more than five hours, a violation of the state\u2019s strict worker\u2019s break laws; 79% of survey respondents said they had served or prepared food while they were sick. </p> <p>\u201cI was constantly pressured to cut labor costs \u2013 this meant that employees were stressed out and customer service suffered because there weren\u2019t enough employees working on my shifts,\u201d Abel Gonzalez, a 42-year-old Carl\u2019s Jr employee in Los Angeles, told researchers.</p> <p>CKE Restaurants did not respond to a request for comment on the research findings, but Elizabeth Johnson, a spokeswoman for the president-elect\u2019s transition team who was not contacted by the Guardian, sent an emailed statement, dismissing the report as \u201cfake news\u201d that was \u201cpaid for by unions and special interests opposed to Andy Puzder\u2019s nomination\u201d. </p> <p>Johnson accused the union of \u201cattempting to smear\u201d Puzder by using \u201cleading questions and deceitful surveying tactics, such as posing as CKE corporate representatives\u201d. The spokeswoman provided no<strong> </strong>evidence for the allegations. </p> <p>Jayaraman, the director of the Food Labor Research Center at University of California, Berkeley, dismissed Johnson\u2019s claims as \u201claughable\u201d and false. \u201cClearly they don\u2019t know how survey research is done,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no way for us to pose as anything when we\u2019re asking staff to voluntarily fill out a survey online.\u201d </p> <p>Roc United researchers also interviewed CKE staff members at stores in four states and, Jayaraman said, identified themselves as researchers before commencing with surveys as well as identifying employees through online social media. </p> <p>The academic said the sample size of 564, taken from states across the US, was more than enough to draw conclusions about entire workforce of over 20,000. </p> <p>\u201cWhen we are looking to do research on a whole metropolitan area, like New York City or Los Angeles,\u201d Jayaraman said, \u201c500 is the survey number we use to understand how working conditions in a whole metropolitan area, and bearing in mind you\u2019re talking about 10 million people and 200,000, 300,000.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday afternoon, current and former employees of Carl\u2019s Jr and Hardee\u2019s spoke for nearly two hours before a panel of convened by Senate Democrats about the poor working conditions and wages at the fast food chains under Puzder\u2019s ownership.</p> <p>During the emotional testimony, one woman described the hardships of raising six children on a salary of only $8.75 an hour after seven years.</p> <p>\u201cI work almost every day and am still considered poor,\u201d Lupe Guzman said, who displayed a framed photograph of her children on the table next to her. She added: \u201cPeople like Andrew Puzder don\u2019t see how regular Americans are living day to day.\u201d</p> <p>Laura McDonald, a former general manager at Carl\u2019s Jr, who is part of a class action lawsuit against CKE concerning overtime pay, said she couldn\u2019t think of \u201canyone less qualified\u201d to run the Department of Labor, an agency that has traditionally existed to protect workers.</p> <p>\u201cHe never protected the employees at CKE when he was in charge so I don\u2019t think he would be the person to protect American workers\u2019 rights,\u201d McDonald said.</p> <p>Democrats have identified Puzder as one of eight nominees who say have particularly \u201ctroublesome\u201d backgrounds. The fast food CEO is an opponent of efforts to raise the minimum wage, a movement that is largely led by industry workers. He is also a critic of sick leave policies and supports repealing the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>Democrats and labor leaders have argued that his appointment is akin to letting the fox guard the henhouse, and cannot be trusted to protect workers\u2019 interests.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not right,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat of Massachusetts said as Guzman spoke about the difficulty of raising a family on a minimum wage salary.</p> <p>\u201cThis is what the secretary of labor is supposed to stand up for - is people like you. We\u2019re here to start the real inquiry about whether or not Mr Puzder is a person who can be trusted to stand up for you and all of the workers of America.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Soaring gin and sparkling wine sales helped Majestic Wine outperform City expectations to deliver its \u201cbiggest ever\u201d Christmas. Majestic said gin sales were up 55% on last year, with upmarket products such as Warner Edwards rhubarb gin and Sipsmith sloe gin performing particularly well. Sparkling wine sales rose 12%, with sales of prosecco increasing three times faster than champagne. The retailer, which also owns the Naked Wines website, said sales at established Majestic Wine stores were up 7.5% in the 10 weeks to 2 January. Sales rose nearly 30% at Naked and 62.3% at the fine wine specialist Lay &amp; Wheeler, putting overall group sales up 12.4%. Analysts had feared Majestic would not achieve its expected sales growth of 6% after the company issued a profit warning in September because of a failed marketing campaign in the US and weak sales to business customers. Shares rose by more than 6% to 345.5p on the strong sales figures. Rowan Gormley, the founder of Naked Wines who became Majestic\u2019s chief executive after the two companies merged in 2015, said the retailer\u2019s transformation plan was working, adding that it was on track to achieve its goal of \u00a3500m in annual sales by 2019. The pace of growth over Christmas was an acceleration from the 5.7% reported for the six months to 26 September and came on top of a strong performance last Christmas when sales rose by 7%. The success was partly bought at the expense of a 1% cut in gross profit margins against last year as the company said it had recognised the need to \u201cremain competitive in a heavily discounted UK market\u201d. David Jeary, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said the statement was bit of a \u201ccurate\u2019s egg.\u201d \u201cIt worries us that the group in aggregate, given its superior delivery of customer services in general, cannot extract any pricing premium with consumers,\u201d he added. \u201cIndeed, it has to bear the higher costs of superior service while competing head-on in price terms with supermarket competitors, which see wine [and spirits] primarily as promotional footfall drivers in peak trading periods.\u201d Sarah Johns, an analyst at Verdict Retail, said Majestic had been right to take on the discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, which have been making heavy gains in alcohol retail. She said value-for-money drinks offers, voucher marketing to encourage spend and free standard delivery for just six bottles had worked. \u201cWith Christmas trading making up almost a third of the retailer\u2019s annual sales, it was important that Majestic performed well,\u201d she said. \u201cThe retailer\u2019s decision to compete with discounters on price resulted in a marginal fall in gross margins. However, this move was ultimately the right one as savvy consumers looked for the best deals on drinks and Majestic\u2019s offers proved alluring.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Prices of Oxo, Bisto and Mr Kipling to rise after pound's Brexit plunge", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shoppers will have to pay more for Oxo stock cubes, Bisto gravy and Mr Kipling cakes as the firm behind the brands prepares to raise prices to offset the fall in the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Premier Foods, which also owns Homepride, Batchelors and Ambrosia rice pudding, will become the latest in a string of companies to offset the weakness of sterling after Unilever clashed with Tesco over the price of products including Marmite. The news comes as a survey showed that over the Christmas period supermarket prices rose for the first time in more than two years, underlining expectations that household budgets will come under increased pressure in 2017. According to the consumer consultancy Kantar Worldpanel, inflation returned with a 0.2% increase in like-for-like grocery prices for the 12-week period ending on 1 January compared with a year earlier. These are not the official inflation figures, but are based on 75,000 products Kantar compares year-on-year in the proportions purchased by shoppers. The rise brings to an end a run of falling prices that began in September 2014 as competition in the sector intensified and supermarkets stepped up their price wars. Premier has been in talks for months with major supermarkets such as Tesco and Asda over price hikes likely to be close to 5% on some ranges. \u201cThe situation on pricing differs between our different categories and brands and is currently under discussion with our individual retail customers,\u201d Premier Foods said. \u201cHowever, on average we are considering rises around the mid single-digit mark.\u201d The company is also considering adjusting \u201cpromotional mechanics\u201d, meaning some offers, such as biscuit packs where customers get extra biscuits \u201cfree\u201d, will be axed. It will also look to make cost savings in some areas, to avoid raising prices or cancelling promotions. Sources familiar with the situation said price rises would be considered on a \u201ccase by case\u201d basis, rather than across the board, and would only be imposed as a \u201clast resort\u201d. The pound has fallen by about 18% against the dollar and 12% against the euro since the UK voted for Brexit last June, which makes imported ingredients more costly, exacerbating high commodity prices. In a presentation to investors last year, Premier said it had no exposure to the dollar because it buys and sells equal amounts of the US currency. The firm said, however, that it spends about \u20ac50m (\u00a344m) a year, suggesting it has taken a \u20ac6m hit from the currency effect. Premier Foods will become the latest supermarket supplier to increase prices as a result of sterling\u2019s fall, raising fears that consumers will be hit in the pocket by rising food inflation. International firms have been particularly badly affected by sterling\u2019s slump because they count their income in foreign currencies. That means that when they convert British sales back into their domestic currency, their value is reduced. Unilever found itself at the centre of a high-profile spat with Tesco after setting out its intention to raise prices for products including Marmite and PG Tips. The food firm was eventually forced into a compromise agreement with the supermarket that curbed the rises, after a brief period in which Tesco ran out of some of its products. Some companies have responded by keeping prices stable, but reducing what shoppers get for their money. Toblerone bars have been redesigned to reduce the amount of chocolate, with the brand\u2019s US owner, Mondelez, blaming the change on \u201chigher costs for ingredients\u201d. Birds Eye fish fingers and Walkers crisps, both ultimately owned by US firms, asked supermarkets for price rises of up to 12% last year. Kantar said retailers offered fewer promotions over the Christmas period, and that fish and butter prices were among the biggest risers. Fraser McKevitt, its head of retail and consumer insight, said: \u201cThe long-anticipated return to inflation suggests that the speed of growth in the overall market will continue to hasten in 2017, and both consumers and retailers will be looking at ways to avoid increasing the cost of the weekly shop. \u201cLast year retailers focused on simplifying their discounts and offers, and the level of promotional sales has fallen to 37% as a result, the lowest level over Christmas since 2009.\u201d The first rise in prices in two years at UK supermarkets reflects the broader economy, where inflation has started to rise. Economists, including those at the Bank of England, have said 2017 will be a tougher year for consumers, with household budgets squeezed as the sharp drop in the value of the pound pushes up inflation. Consumer price inflation is expected to rise to about 3% this year, from a current level of 1.2%. Kantar said the supermarkets had enjoyed a record Christmas, with sales up 1.8% over the quarter to 1 January compared with a year earlier. Of the big four, Tesco had the strongest growth, with sales up 1.3%. Asda was the worst performer, with sales down 2.4%. McKevitt said: \u201cYear-on-year market growth has been helped by comparisons to a weaker Christmas in 2015, but sales were also buoyed by strong consumer appetite for festive celebration after a turbulent year. Shoppers spent \u00a3480m more at the tills than in 2015, leading to record sales for the Christmas period.\u201d The research group Nielsen said Britain\u2019s supermarkets had their best Christmas in four years as a last-minute rush for groceries triggered a surge in sales. Takings at the tills in the four-week period ending 31 December were up by 3.3% compared with a year earlier, making it the strongest growth since 2012 and a vast improvement on 2015, when sales were flat. Mike Watkins, Nielsen\u2019s UK head of retailer and business insight, said 2016 was one of the biggest-ever end-of-year trading periods for supermarkets. He said: \u201cThe remarkable buoyancy in shoppers spending freely in the final two weeks of the year to enjoy the festivities was good news for retailers considering the consumer headwinds expected in 2017 with the return of cost price inflation \u2013 after three years of deflation \u2013 plus the ongoing uncertainty about the impact of Brexit on UK grocery sales.\u201d",

The rise brings to an end a run of falling prices that began in September 2014 as competition in the sector intensified and supermarkets stepped up their price wars.</p> <p>Premier has been in talks for months with major supermarkets such as Tesco and Asda over price hikes likely to be close to 5% on some ranges.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe situation on pricing differs between our different categories and brands and is currently under discussion with our individual retail customers,\u201d Premier Foods said.<br></p> <p>\u201cHowever, on average we are considering rises around the mid single-digit mark.\u201d</p> <p>The company is also considering adjusting \u201cpromotional mechanics\u201d, meaning some offers, such as biscuit packs where customers get extra biscuits \u201cfree\u201d, will be axed. It will also look to make cost savings in some areas, to avoid raising prices or cancelling promotions.</p> <p>Sources familiar with the situation said price rises would be considered on a \u201ccase by case\u201d basis, rather than across the board, and would only be imposed as a \u201clast resort\u201d.</p> <p>The pound has fallen by about 18% against the dollar and 12% against the euro since the UK voted for Brexit last June, which makes imported ingredients more costly, exacerbating high commodity prices.</p> <p>In a presentation to investors last year, Premier said it had no exposure to the dollar because it buys and sells equal amounts of the US currency. The firm said, however, that it spends about \u20ac50m (\u00a344m) a year, suggesting it has taken a \u20ac6m hit from the currency effect.</p> <p>Premier Foods will become the latest supermarket supplier to increase prices as a result of sterling\u2019s fall, raising fears that consumers will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/uk-inflation-rises-near-two-year-high-consumer-price-index\">hit in the pocket by rising food inflation</a>.</p> <p>International firms have been particularly badly affected by sterling\u2019s slump because they count their income in foreign currencies.

The food firm was eventually forced into a compromise agreement with the supermarket that curbed the rises, after a brief period in which Tesco ran out of some of its products.</p> <p>Some companies have responded by keeping prices stable, but reducing what shoppers get for their money. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/08/toblerone-gap-brexit-falling-pound-2016\">Toblerone bars have been redesigned</a> to reduce the amount of chocolate, with the brand\u2019s US owner, Mondelez, blaming the change on \u201chigher costs for ingredients\u201d.</p> <p>Birds Eye fish fingers and Walkers crisps, both ultimately owned by US firms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/06/birds-eye-walkers-supermarkets-price-rise-brexit-vote-pound\">asked supermarkets for price rises</a> of up to 12% last year.</p> <p>Kantar said retailers offered fewer promotions over the Christmas period, and that fish and butter prices were among the biggest risers.</p> <p>Fraser McKevitt, its head of retail and consumer insight, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cThe long-anticipated return to inflation suggests that the speed of growth in the overall market will continue to hasten in 2017, and both consumers and retailers will be looking at ways to avoid increasing the cost of the weekly shop.</p> <p>\u201cLast year retailers focused on simplifying their discounts and offers, and the level of promotional sales has fallen to 37% as a result, the lowest level over Christmas since 2009.\u201d</p> <p>The first rise in prices in two years at UK supermarkets reflects the broader economy, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/13/uk-inflation-november-petrol-clothing-ons\">inflation has started to rise</a>. Economists, including those at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-rate-cuts-2017-growth-forecast-inflation\">the Bank of England, have said 2017 will be a tougher year for consumers</a>, with household budgets squeezed as the sharp drop in the value of the pound pushes up inflation. Consumer price inflation is expected to rise to about 3% this year, from a current level of 1.2%.</p> <p>Kantar said the supermarkets had enjoyed a record Christmas, with sales up 1.8% over the quarter to 1 January compared with a year earlier. Of the big four, Tesco had the strongest growth, with sales up 1.3%. Asda was the worst performer, with sales down 2.4%.</p> <p>McKevitt said: \u201cYear-on-year market growth has been helped by comparisons to a weaker Christmas in 2015, but sales were also buoyed by strong consumer appetite for festive celebration after a turbulent year. Shoppers spent \u00a3480m more at the tills than in 2015, leading to record sales for the Christmas period.\u201d</p> <p>The research group Nielsen said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/supermarkets\">Britain\u2019s supermarkets </a>had their best Christmas in four years as a last-minute rush for groceries triggered a surge in sales.</p> <p>Takings at the tills in the four-week period ending 31 December were up by 3.3% compared with a year earlier, making it the strongest growth since 2012 and a vast improvement on 2015, when sales were flat.</p> <p>Mike Watkins, Nielsen\u2019s UK head of retailer and business insight, said 2016 was one of the biggest-ever end-of-year trading periods for supermarkets.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe remarkable buoyancy in shoppers spending freely in the final two weeks of the year to enjoy the festivities was good news for retailers considering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-rate-cuts-2017-growth-forecast-inflation\">the consumer headwinds expected in 2017</a> with the return of cost price inflation \u2013 after three years of deflation \u2013 plus the ongoing uncertainty about the impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> on UK grocery sales.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Renewed strike action on Southern rail has left hundreds of thousands of commuters again struggling to get to work by alternative means. Cabin crew at British Airways have also started a two-day strike, while efforts continued to restart talks to avert further action on the London Underground. Virtually all of Southern\u2019s trains were wiped out on Tuesday, as drivers from the Aslef union started a second period of strike action in the long-running dispute over the role of guards. Southern ran two early-morning trains from Brighton to Victoria, operated by driver-managers and unadvertised, which carried a few passengers who had turned up for Thameslink trains, and a few peak-hour non-stopping services on the Caterham-Victoria line, but the rest of its 2,242 daily trains were cancelled. Southern owner Govia Thameslink Railway said there was a good uptake on the buses it had arranged for connections with other train operators. A GTR spokesman said: \u201cWe would like to thank passengers for their patience and understanding, and for heeding the advice to only travel if absolutely necessary.\u201d Further strikes are due on Wednesday and Friday, while services will also be severely disrupted on Thursday as the effects of the walkout and an overtime ban persist. The strike follows a similar three days of action over a week in December, and a third tranche of strikes is planned from Tuesday 24 January. Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said: \u201cWe greatly regret the industrial action we have taken on Southern railway today. We don\u2019t want to inconvenience passengers, nor do our members want to lose money, because we want to help build a better railway for Britain. But we have been forced to go on strike by an intransigent management that has not been prepared to negotiate with us. \u201cSouthern are bullies. Throughout this dispute, from when they first announced their intentions 10 months ago, they have tried to force through changes in the terms and conditions of staff by tearing up agreements rather than by negotiating. \u201cIn contrast, we stick to deals we have made and have always been willing to negotiate when someone shows goodwill; that is how we managed to strike a deal last year with ScotRail which works well for the company, the passengers and the staff. So it can be done.\u201d Whelan said he hoped that Southern would resume talks to find a resolution. The company said it was \u201cavailable\u201d for talks, but no negotiations were planned. Meanwhile, a second transport strike got under way, by British Airways cabin crew, in a dispute over pay. About 2,500 Unite members working at Heathrow started a 48-hour strike that has forced the airline to cancel 22 flights on Tuesday out of around 800 planned. BA said that the flights had been merged with other departures so that all passengers would get to their destinations. Flights to Hamburg, D\u00fcsseldorf, San Jose [California], Oslo and Aberdeen were among those affected. The strike is by members of the mixed fleet, a branch of cabin crew established during the bitter strikes of 2010-11 on inferior terms and conditions, and which all recruits must now join. Basic pay starts at just over \u00a312,000, although the airline says most earn at least \u00a321,000 after additional flight pay and allowances. Unite members mounted picket lines in the Heathrow area. A union spokesman said: \u201cThe strike is being solidly supported, and we are receiving support from passing motorists.\u201d The action comes a day after London\u2019s transport services were severely affected by a 24-hour strike by tube station staff that left most London Underground services down and caused gridlock on the roads. More strikes could be called but all parties have signalled a willingness to keep talking. Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA, one of two unions representing the station staff, said: \u201cWe hope London Underground will resume talks with us without delay so that a resolution to this longstanding dispute can be found.\u201d He said that all sides agreed more jobs should be restored for a safe service. \u201cGiven this, a resolution should not be beyond our wit. Our negotiating team remains available for talks anytime, anywhere.\u201d London Underground said it urged more talks and the RMT union said it remained available. The RMT\u2019s general secretary, Mick Cash, said the union\u2019s executive was considering its next steps, and warned: \u201cTube bosses have conceded that more jobs are required to tackle the growing safety and security crisis but RMT is looking at substantial moves that can be properly evaluated and signed off by our safety reps, who know better than anyone what is required on the ground.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "FTSE 100 closes at new high in longest-ever winning streak", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 reached another new peak on Tuesday and broke a near 20-year record for its longest run of closing highs. The index jumped 37.70 points or 0.52% to end the day at 7,275, its ninth consecutive day of closing highs, beating the eight-day run in May 1997 following Labour\u2019s general election landslide under Tony Blair. The latest boost for investors has come mainly from the weakness of the pound since the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote last June. Sterling has lost more than 18% against the dollar and is hovering close to 31-year lows, excluding October\u2019s flash crash. It has fallen 12% against the euro. By the time the London market closed, the pound was flat at $1.2164, having fallen sharply on Monday followng comments from Theresa May suggesting a hard Brexit was on the cards. Over the weekend the prime minister dismissed the idea that the UK could \u201ckeep bits of membership\u201d, which appeared to quash hopes of retaining access to the single market. The plunging pound has lifted the FTSE 100 because it is packed with overseas earners and international businesses such as mining companies. A weak pound boosts their dollar revenues and profits and makes their goods more competitive. A stable performance from the UK economy despite the dire warnings ahead of the EU referendum also provided support for the market, and a recovery in the oil price was another factor in the rise of commodity companies. Mining companies were among the main gainers in 2016, with the FTSE mining index up 100% over the year, and they have continued to help push the market higher since the turn of the year. Four of the top 10 risers on the FTSE 100 on Tuesday were commodity companies, with Anglo American \u2013 up more 313% since the start of 2016 \u2013 leading the way. Supermarkets also helped push the FTSE 100 to its new record after good Christmas trading results from Morrisons. The comparative weakness of sterling has also attracted overseas investors looking for bargains in the market despite the Brexit risks, and reopened the prospect of international companies snapping up UK peers at cheaper prices. Last year\u2019s \u00a324bn Japanese takeover of the chip designer Arm is a case in point. The FTSE 100 may continue to move higher if, as expected, the pound continues to struggle. Michael Hewson, the chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: \u201cMarkets once again appear to be pricing in the prospect of a so-called hard Brexit, and the extra costs that the leaving of the single market might entail, which has once again seen the pound come under pressure. \u201cWith the March deadline for article 50 fast approaching, the uncertainty [over Brexit] isn\u2019t likely to diminish, and this may well pressure the pound further in weeks ahead.\u201d The FTSE 100\u2019s rise is also part of a general move higher for most major global markets after the surprise election of Donald Trump as US president, and his promise to boost spending on infrastructure and introduce other measures to lift the US economy. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 have hit new peaks in recent weeks. After coming within a whisker of the elusive 20,000 barrier on Friday before falling back, the Dow rebounded in early trading on Tuesday to within 60 points of it. Even the more UK domestically focused FTSE 250 hit a new closing high of 18,413 on Tuesday, although it remains below its all time peak of 18,607 reached on 4 Ocober 2016. The FTSE 100\u2019s record winning streak came against a very different background to the May 1997 gains. Then the market was boosted by Blair\u2019s attempts to distance himself from previous Labour administrations and the trade unions, his move to abandon nationalisation and income tax rises, and the decision to give the Bank of England independence to set interest rates. The FTSE 100 itself was a very different creature, with just one mining company in the form of RTZ, now Rio Tinto, a large proportion of consumer goods groups such as Cadbury Schweppes, EMI, Bass and Allied Domecq, and several utilities including Thames Water, PowerGen and Scottish Power. With the dotcom boom a couple of years away, the main technology companies were telecoms group such at British Telecommunications, Cable and Wireless, Vodafone and Orange.",

Four of the top 10 risers on the FTSE 100 on Tuesday were commodity companies, with Anglo American \u2013 up more 313% since the start of 2016 \u2013 leading the way.

      "bodyText": "The Daily Mirror group, Trinity Mirror, has confirmed it is back in talks with Richard Desmond about a potential tie-up with Express Newspapers, owner of the Express and the Star. Trinity Mirror, which has seen its share price fall by 42% in the last year, said it was in \u201cearly stage\u201d talks with Desmond\u2019s Northern &amp; Shell, the parent company of Express Newspapers. The talks are also thought to involve Desmond\u2019s OK! magazine, which was part of the negotiations two years ago. \u201cThe board of Trinity Mirror notes the recent media speculation and confirms that it is at an early stage of discussions towards taking a minority interest in a new company comprising certain of Northern &amp; Shell\u2019s assets,\u201d the company said in an announcement to the stock market. \u201cNo offer has been made and there is no certainty that any agreement will be reached.\u201d The two companies held talks about a potential deal two years ago. The negotiations fizzled out, however, over disagreements about price and the pension deficit at Desmond\u2019s paper. Negotiations, which are thought to have started late last year, are focused on a potential merger of back office and sales operations to make significant savings. The talks come as UK national newspaper publishers including Trinity Mirror, the Telegraph, the Sun and Times owner News UK and the Guardian explore combining print and digital advertising sales to fight back against the growing dominance of Google and Facebook. Express Newspapers is not involved in the initiative, Project Juno. In May last year, the firm reported it had more than tripled pre-tax profits in 2015 to \u00a330.5m after slashing staff and printing costs. Desmond has been thinning his media portfolio in recent years, selling Channel 5 to MTV\u2019s owner, Viacom, for \u00a3463m in 2014. He also sold his adult TV business in April last year, including the Television X and Red Hot channels, severing his last link with the industry that helped make him a billionaire. He sold his adult magazine titles including Asian Babes and Big Ones for about \u00a320m in 2004. Desmond acquired Express Newspapers in 2000 for \u00a3125m. He was seeking more than \u00a3100m to take full control of Express Newspapers and OK! in the talks held two years ago. Northern &amp; Shell also owns the loss-making Health Lottery. Last year, Trinity Mirror looked at buying Evgeny Lebedev\u2019s i newspaper, the cut-price national newspaper originally launched to support the Independent. It was outbid by the regional publisher Johnston Press, which acquired i for \u00a324.4m last February. Lebedev closed the print editions of the Independent and Independent on Sunday the following month. In a bid to drive growth in the national newspaper market \u2013 like other publishers, Trinity has seen consistent double-digit declines in print advertising \u2013 the company moved to launch its own low-cost title in February. The New Day, which had a \u00a35m launch with the tagline \u201cSeize the New Day\u201d, closed after just two months. When the last talks between Desmond and Trinity Mirror broke down, the Mirror publisher secured a \u00a3220m deal to buy the regional newspaper publisher Local World. The deal added more than 100 regional newspaper titles to Trinity Mirror\u2019s existing 130 local papers, spanning titles from the Nottingham Post and Cambridge News to the Manchester Evening News and Liverpool Echo. Trinity Mirror and Northern &amp; Shell declined to comment. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 July 2017. An earlier version said The New Day launched in May 2016. This has been changed to February.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Morrisons had its best Christmas for seven years after the supermarket chain revamped its premium ranges, opened more tills and cut fewer prices. Britain\u2019s fourth-largest retailer reported a 2.9% increase in sales excluding fuel in the nine weeks to 1 January, with fresh fruit and vegetables, beers, wine and spirits, and its new upmarket The Best range faring well. Sales of Morrisons\u2019 Nutmeg clothing range were up by 30%, while performance was lifted by a 0.6% rise in online sales, partly thanks to its tie-up with Amazon. It was Morrisons\u2019 biggest quarterly sales rise at stores open for more than a year since Christmas 2009, and well ahead of the 1.6% growth reported in the previous quarter. Total sales excluding fuel went up by 2%, the first rise since November 2013, despite store closures over the year. David Potts, the chief executive of the Bradford-based supermarket, said stores had been more prepared to meet demand than in previous years, with better-stocked shelves and improved service. \u201cWe are delighted to have found our mojo,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery year does bring its challenges, but so far we haven\u2019t seen any change in consumer sentiment. Customers splashed out over Christmas and wanted to trade up.\u201d He said the company had sold 50,000 packs of \u201cshimmering macarons\u201d and sold out online of a Christmas tree-shaped chocolate gateau before it could reach stores, as shoppers snapped up 100 new premium festive products. \u201cThe Best was a gamechanger for us this Christmas,\u201d Potts said. But he insisted that Morrisons had done better \u201cacross the board\u201d, and the sales increase was to do with more than premium food and cheap alcohol. \u201cWe are becoming more relevant to more people as we turn the company around,\u201d Potts said. Morrisons\u2019 figures were also underpinned by a big drop in price deflation. The company said its prices were down by only 0.2% during the Christmas period, compared with a 1% fall in the previous quarter. The squeeze on prices was felt across the whole market, with grocery prices rising by 0.2% in the 12 weeks to 1 January, the first inflation in just over two years, according to market data released by Kantar Worldpanel on Tuesday. But Trevor Strain, the Morrisons chief financial officer, said: \u201cDespite commodity pressures, our Christmas basket was still very competitive.\u201d Morrisons is thought to have outperformed its major competitors, but smaller chains including Aldi, Iceland and the Co-operative also did well over the Christmas period. The Co-op announced on Tuesday that sales increased by 3.5% at stores open more than a year in the three weeks to New Year\u2019s Eve. The convenience store group said its biggest-selling line was own-label prosecco, but frozen ready meals and fresh produce also sold well. Phil Dorrell, a partner at consultancy Retail Remedy, described the Christmas sales jump at Morrisons as \u201cquite remarkable\u201d. \u201cPotts has turned this ship around and while navigating a big tanker like this takes time, his grip on the tiller is both clear and strong. Morrisons\u2019 Christmas marketing campaign was fresh and delivered a relevant food quality feel,\u201d he said. Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein, said: \u201cThis strong result reflects good execution by Morrisons as customers lost over the past few years come back to stores. \u201cWe also expect it to reflect an overall strong Christmas by UK food retailers, with this result boding well for Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco results later this week.\u201d Potts said: \u201cThis Christmas we made further improvements to the customer shopping trip. We stocked more of what our customers wanted to buy, more tills were open more often, and product availability improved as more than half of sales went through our new ordering system. Both like for like and total sales grew, which was very encouraging.\u201d The company raised its full-year guidance following the better than expected festive trading season. It expects underlying pretax profit for the full 2016-17 year to be between \u00a3330m and \u00a3340m, ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations of about \u00a3326m. Morrisons maintained its guidance that net debt would be about \u00a31.2bn at the end of the financial year. Morrisons\u2019 share price rose by nearly 4% following the upbeat update, which also helped boost Tesco\u2019s shares by nearly 6% and Sainsbury\u2019s by 1.6%.",

Customers splashed out over Christmas and wanted to trade up.\u201d</p> <p>He said the company had sold 50,000 packs of \u201cshimmering macarons\u201d and sold out online of a Christmas tree-shaped chocolate gateau before it could reach stores, as shoppers snapped up 100 new premium festive products. \u201cThe Best was a gamechanger for us this Christmas,\u201d Potts said.<br></p> <p>But he insisted that Morrisons had done better \u201cacross the board\u201d, and the sales increase was to do with more than premium food and cheap alcohol.</p> <p>\u201cWe are becoming more relevant to more people as we turn the company around,\u201d Potts said.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0bb07c4d850d61a45d900b1713ab97b9c6c9bcf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bb07c4d850d61a45d900b1713ab97b9c6c9bcf9/0_135_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Potts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Potts, the chief executive of Morrisons, hailed its extra Christmas preparation and improved service for the results.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikael Buck</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morrisons\u2019 figures were also underpinned by a big drop in price deflation. The company said its prices were down by only 0.2% during the Christmas period, compared with a 1% fall in the previous quarter.</p> <p>The squeeze on prices was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/13/uk-grocery-prices-tesco-kantar\">felt across the whole market</a>, with grocery prices rising by 0.2% in the 12 weeks to 1 January, the first inflation in just over two years, according to market data released by Kantar Worldpanel on Tuesday.</p> <p>But Trevor Strain, the Morrisons chief financial officer, said: \u201cDespite commodity pressures, our Christmas basket was still very competitive.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Morrisons is thought to have outperformed its major competitors, but smaller chains including Aldi, Iceland and the Co-operative also did well over the Christmas period.</p> <p>The Co-op announced on Tuesday that sales increased by 3.5% at stores open more than a year in the three weeks to New Year\u2019s Eve. The convenience store group said its biggest-selling line was own-label prosecco, but frozen ready meals and fresh produce also sold well.</p> <p>Phil Dorrell, a partner at consultancy Retail Remedy, described the Christmas sales jump at Morrisons as \u201cquite remarkable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPotts has turned this ship around and while navigating a big tanker like this takes time, his grip on the tiller is both clear and strong. Morrisons\u2019 Christmas marketing campaign was fresh and delivered a relevant food quality feel,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein, said: \u201cThis strong result reflects good execution by Morrisons as customers lost over the past few years come back to stores.</p> <p>\u201cWe also expect it to reflect an overall strong Christmas by UK food retailers, with this result boding well for Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco results later this week.\u201d</p> <p>Potts said: \u201cThis Christmas we made further improvements to the customer shopping trip. We stocked more of what our customers wanted to buy, more tills were open more often, and product availability improved as more than half of sales went through our new ordering system. Both like for like and total sales grew, which was very encouraging.\u201d</p> <p>The company raised its full-year guidance following the better than expected festive trading season. It expects underlying pretax profit for the full 2016-17 year to be between \u00a3330m and \u00a3340m, ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations of about \u00a3326m.</p> <p>Morrisons maintained its guidance that net debt would be about \u00a31.2bn at the end of the financial year.</p> <p>Morrisons\u2019 share price rose by nearly 4% following the upbeat update, which also helped boost Tesco\u2019s shares by nearly 6% and Sainsbury\u2019s by 1.6%.</p>",

      "bodyText": "UK retail sales continued to grow at the end of last year as Britons made a late dash for Christmas gifts and festive foods, according to industry figures that add to signs the economy ended 2016 on a strong note. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) pointed to challenges ahead from rising costs and political uncertainty but said its members went into the new year having enjoyed solid sales growth over the crucial Christmas period. Sales rose 1% in December from the year earlier, on a like-for-like basis. That was an improvement on November and was boosted by last-minute gift-buying and strong food sales. \u201cRetailers were helped by the timing of Christmas, which fell on a Sunday, giving shoppers the chance to use the weekend for a final dash to the shops delivering a last-minute boost to sales,\u201d said Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, which helps to compile the BRC report. The BRC\u2019s report chimed with figures from the discount supermarket Aldi that showed total UK sales for December were up 15% on a year earlier, helped by strong demand for festive vegetables, prosecco and its premium products such as \u201cspecially selected\u201d mince pies. Separate figures from Barclaycard also suggested that the final three months of 2016 had seen the highest growth for four years in consumer spending, which encompasses leisure activities and petrol as well as spending in shops and online. But there had been a slowdown at the very end of the year, according to Barclaycard, which processes about half the UK\u2019s card transactions. Consumer spending grew 4% year on year in December, a change of pace from growth in excess of 5% in October and November. Echoing other reports, Barclaycard said online retailers enjoyed strong sales, as did pubs and restaurants but high street stores suffered. Spending on clothing was the hardest hit. It also noted some of the rise in spending was down to higher prices, including for petrol, and not because people were buying more in volume terms. Paul Lockstone, managing director at Barclaycard, said: \u201c2016 saw consumer spending growth sign off with a very strong quarter, but the headline number masks a story of softening spend growth as the year came to an end. \u201cThis could be an early indication of things to come as consumers seem to have entered 2017 with more caution, citing worries about inflation and the triggering of article 50. Looking ahead, all eyes will be on whether this year will see households begin to feel squeezed by rising prices, leading to a sustained fall in consumer spending on discretionary items in favour of their day-to-day essentials.\u201d Those concerns were echoed by BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson. She said retail sales growth in 2016 as a whole, at 1.2%, was already slower than in 2015. \u201cThe challenge for retailers in 2017 will be to create real growth against a backdrop of growing inflationary pressures and persisting economic and political uncertainty,\u201d Dickinson added. Inflation is expected to rise this year as the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote makes imports more expensive. The market researcher IGD, which compiled the BRC\u2019s grocery figures, said shoppers were worrying about the possible return of food inflation. Its poll of 1,707 people found that three-quarters anticipated higher prices in 2017. With the cost of imports and imminent Brexit talks in focus, it also noted another potential trend. \u201cA surge in patriotism could be another important factor, with 45% believing it\u2019s more important to buy British-produced food now the UK has voted to leave the EU,\u201d said IGD chief executive Joanne Denney-Finch.",
