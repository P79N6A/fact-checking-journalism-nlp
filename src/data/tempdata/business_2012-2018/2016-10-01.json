      "bodyText": "On Tuesday, the House of Representatives standing committee on economics will hold its first hearing on the performance of the big four banks and it is a fair bet that the pay of the executives who appear before the committee will be a topic of discussion. In March, the insurance arm of the Commonwealth Bank was revealed in a joint sitting to have conducted unethical practices so bad that it gave impetus to the ALP\u2019s call for a royal commission into the banks. It was a year in which the bank\u2019s share price fell from $85.55 in June 2015 to $74.37 at the end of June this year. So not a great year. But not to worry. Ian Narev, the bank\u2019s chief executive, still had a pay rise of 54%. Narev didn\u2019t get an increase in his \u201cbase\u201d cash pay \u2013 that $2.625m was the same as last year. It was through bonuses that he came good. The biggest bonus was not for his performance in the past year \u2013 at $1.431m, his \u201cshort-term\u201d cash bonus of 2015-16 was slightly down on the $1.59m he received last year. No, the big money came via \u201cdeferred equity awards\u201d worth $6.597m, which were based on performance from 2011 to 2015. All up, the 12 CBA executives received a total of $52.36m \u2013 up 30% from the $40.1m they received last year. Not bad, given the wages of workers in Australia increased by a record low 2.1% in the same period. But maybe we are being unfair. CEO and executive pay is pretty byzantine in its combination of base cash pay and cash and equity awards. If we look at the total accrual pay, Narev only had a 5.4% pay rise \u2013 up $450,000 from $8.31m to $8.77m. It\u2019s worth noting his pay raise alone would place him in the top 1% of wage earners in Australia. The total base pay rise for all CBA executives was 13.9% \u2013 nearly seven times more than the average Australian worker. And while this might just be dismissed as envy, it highlights \u2013 as the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors has found \u2013 that while the base cash pay of CEOs is not rising markedly, they are instead getting large \u201cbonuses,\u201d which are close to automatic. Their report on the CEO pay of the ASX100 companies found that the average and median base pay for CEOs had actually fallen since the global financial crisis. But that was not due to some hairshirt pay cuts. The head of the ACSI, Louise Davidson, instead notes that it is due to \u201cboards taking the opportunity to pay the replacements of departing CEOs less\u201d. She also noted that 2015 had the highest level of bonuses for CEOs in the ASX100 since 2008, concluding that \u201cit\u2019s clear that bonuses are the new normal\u201d. But just what gets a CEO a bonus is less clear. Most would assume it is the share price or profit. But increasingly, \u201cnon-financial\u201d objectives are becoming the determinant. Some of these objectives are measurable \u2013 such as customer satisfaction \u2013 but others are pretty softly defined and weakly measured. Worse, most come under what people would consider to be the CEO\u2019s actual job description. For example, among the short-term incentives for CBA executives are categories such as \u201ctalent and leadership\u201d, \u201csafety\u201d, \u201cdiversity\u201d, \u201cengagement\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d. The CBA annual report noted one measure against these criteria was that the executive group had \u201csuccessfully implemented a global human resource management system across offshore locations\u201d. Well one would hope so, given that would surely be the job of the human resource executives ... Underlying this however is that CEO pay, as Julie Walker noted this week, has risen so greatly over the past two decades that it now bears no relation to the pay of the average worker. In 2015, the average ASX100 CEO pay of $4.99m was 83 times the average annual earnings of $59,628. The difference is so disparate that comparison has almost become ludicrous \u2013 but it remains worthwhile. Were public companies required to publish a ratio of their CEO pay to the median pay of workers in their companies, it would provide strong information on growth of executive pay over time. Who knows, it might shame company boards into withholding bonuses \u2013 though perhaps only if shame were included as a non-financial objective. The concern that CEO bonuses would encourage risky behaviour remains an issue. The new governor of the RBA, Dr Philip Lowe, told the House economics committee last week that he would focus on ensuring \u201cthe remuneration structures within financial institutions promote behaviour that benefits not just the institution but its client\u201d. But the reliance on non-financial objectives highlights that while workers have seen their pay rises diminish because of low inflation and slack economic growth, CEOs have found a way around such financial matters that affect the rest of us.",

      "bodyText": "For chancellors of the exchequer, annual International Monetary Fund meetings have not always been the happiest of occasions. Heading there in early October 2008, Alistair Darling knew that the solvency of the UK banking system was hanging by a thread. In 1992, Norman Lamont went to Washington with his economic strategy in tatters after Britain\u2019s departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday. In 1976, on his way to Manila, Denis Healey only managed to get as far as London\u2019s Heathrow airport, such was the intensity of the sterling crisis. On that occasion, the chancellor did not need to go to the IMF: the IMF came to him. Compared with some of his predecessors, Philip Hammond has got off lightly. The IMF\u2019s belief \u2013 expressed repeatedly and forcefully before the EU referendum on 23 June \u2013 was that Brexit would be to 2016 what the collapse of Lehman Brothers was to 2008 \u2013 the trigger for a massive global economic shock. These fears have so far proved unfounded. The UK appears unlikely to plunge into the immediate recession confidently predicted by the IMF. House prices are not collapsing and there has been no stock-market crash. The impact on the rest of the global economy has so far been minimal. Yet it is safe to say that finance ministers and central bank governors are unlikely to be in celebratory mood when they jet in to Washington later this week. Even in the absence of an immediate meltdown, they will have plenty to talk about. Here are five topics likely to be on the agenda. Brexit and other threats to the global economy While the IMF has revised upwards its short-term forecasts for the UK economy, it remains convinced that the long-term impact will be negative, particularly if Theresa May\u2019s government makes control of migration a higher priority than continued access to the single market. Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, will urge the Bank of England and the Treasury to continue providing stimulus to the economy, with a warning that there could be fresh turbulence for both the UK and the rest of the EU when, with the triggering of article 50, divorce proceedings eventually start. Even so, having been a cheerleader for what Leave campaigners called Project Fear, Lagarde and her officials will have some explaining to do. Hammond is keen to talk up the prospects for the UK economy and will expect Lagarde to be less pessimistic than she was during the referendum campaign. The IMF can be expected to focus on other worries \u2013 and it has plenty of choice. The IMF\u2019s global financial stability report is likely to highlight the problems of European banks hobbled by hundreds of billions of euros\u2019 worth of non-performing loans. It will be urging a speedy resolution of the problems besetting Deutsche Bank. It also fears that defeat for Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, in the referendum on reform of the senate called for December would lead to a political and economic crisis that would have ramifications for the whole eurozone. Other countries being closely monitored by the IMF include the US \u2013 now set to grow more slowly in 2016 than was predicted six months ago \u2013 and China, where the government is trying to rebalance the economy away from its reliance on exports. Adjusting to the \u2018new mediocre\u2019 Ten years ago, the global economy was growing rapidly. Between 2003 and 2006, global growth averaged more than 5% a year \u2013 the strongest performance since the early 1970s. The IMF\u2019s flagship publication, the World Economic Outlook, could see no reason why the \u201cnew normal\u201d would come to an end and hailed the liberalisation of world financial markets as an unmitigated benefit. Times have changed. The new normal has become what Lagarde describes as the \u201cnew mediocre\u201d \u2013 in which growth remains stuck at barely more than 3% a year, thanks largely to the persistently poor performance of the developed nations: the US, Europe and Japan. \u201cFor the past several years, the global recovery has been weak and fragile, and this continues to be the case today, especially for advanced economies,\u201d she said in a speech last week. \u201cAnd while there are some good signs, the overall growth outlook still remains subdued.\u201d The IMF\u2019s concerns about Brexit stem, in part, from the knowledge that it would not take much for mediocre growth and low levels of inflation to turn into recession and deflation. Central banks are out of ammo Global growth has been weak despite the best efforts of central banks. They have cut interest rates to record low rates and made repeated use of the money-creation process known as quantitative easing in an attempt to boost demand. This week\u2019s meeting take place against a backdrop of growing speculation that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year. But other central banks \u2013 the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank \u2013are moving in the opposite direction and providing additional stimulus. Lagarde has maintained a neutral position on a rise in US interest rates, but is known to fear the volatility a rate rise could bring \u2013 as money held in developing world banks, and even in London and Frankfurt, flows to the US in search of a safe return at a higher rate. She also thinks central banks are being asked to do too much, and that achieving higher levels of growth will require a three-pronged approach: monetary stimulus, tax cuts or spending increases from finance ministries, and structural reform. The IMF has urged countries which have the financial headroom to do so to spend money on growth-boosting public investment. In a recent speech, Lagarde singled out Canada, Germany and South Korea as ones with plenty of spare cash. And this comes after an IMF report at the beginning for the year called on the G20 nations, including the UK, US, Mexico and Turkey, to ramp up their outlay on much-needed infrastructure projects. The ghost of protectionism The IMF was born out of the turmoil of the 1930s, when tit-for-tat protectionism amplified the effects of the Great Depression. Since its creation at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, the IMF has been at the forefront of attempts to reduce barriers to trade. It now views with alarm the ebb tide of globalisation, seen in the anti free-trade rhetoric of Donald Trump, the stalling of negotiations between Washington and Brussels on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Brexit vote. The director general of the World Trade Organisation, Roberto Azev\u00eado, will join Lagarde in Washington this week to make the case for freer trade. The concern of both organisations is not just that there has been a gradual rise over the past four years in the number of protectionist measures introduced, but that there is a risk of an anti-trade narrative taking root, which says all the gains from openness are being captured by a tiny global elite. Lagarde says this mood is encouraged by growing inequality, and that tackling the divide between rich and poor would make it easier to negotiate trade deals and for governments to push for other structural reforms. A new debt crisis For the past decade, the activities of the IMF have overshadowed those of its sister organisation, the World Bank, which also holds its annual meeting this week. The focus has been on the problems of the developed world \u2013 the sub-prime crisis, the near collapse of the banks, the threat to the euro and Brexit \u2013 rather than on the world\u2019s poorest countries, many of which had been growing rapidly as a result of booming commodity prices. Many poor countries borrowed heavily on the global capital markets during the good times but are now finding the environment far more hostile. Weak demand in the developed world has led to sharp falls in commodity prices and slower growth in developing countries. The World Bank expects growth in sub-Saharan Africa to be just 1.6% \u2013 the lowest in more than two decades. Angola, Kenya and Nigeria are among countries that have already turned to the IMF and the World Bank for help, and if growth remains weak others are likely to join them. The echoes of another age \u2013 one when the annual meetings were dominated by calls for debt relief \u2013 are getting louder.",

The IMF can be expected to focus on other worries \u2013 and it has plenty of choice.</p> <p>The IMF\u2019s global financial stability report is likely to highlight the problems of European banks hobbled by hundreds of billions of euros\u2019 worth of non-performing loans. It will be urging a speedy resolution of the problems besetting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/deutschebank\" title=\"\">Deutsche Bank</a>. It also fears that defeat for Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, in the referendum on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/06/matteo-renzi-italy-referendum-banks-brexit\" title=\"\">reform of the senate</a> called for December would lead to a political and economic crisis that would have ramifications for the whole eurozone.</p> <p>Other countries being closely monitored by the IMF include the US \u2013 now set to grow more slowly in 2016 than was predicted six months ago \u2013 and China, where the government is trying to rebalance the economy away from its reliance on exports.</p> <h2>Adjusting to the \u2018new mediocre\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b6d62d9334bf12753bc64e8c29bb18df77ec4c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b6d62d9334bf12753bc64e8c29bb18df77ec4c6/0_294_4992_2996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedestrians walk past an electronics stock display at the window of a security company in Tokyo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poor economic performance in Japan, as well as the US and Europe, means world growth is stuck at around 3%.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toshifumi Kitamura/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ten years ago, the global economy was growing rapidly. Between 2003 and 2006, global growth averaged more than 5% a year \u2013 the strongest performance since the early 1970s. The IMF\u2019s flagship publication, the World Economic Outlook, could see no reason why the \u201cnew normal\u201d would come to an end and hailed the liberalisation of world financial markets as an unmitigated benefit.</p> <p>Times have changed. The new normal has become what Lagarde describes as the \u201cnew mediocre\u201d \u2013 in which growth remains stuck at barely more than 3% a year, thanks largely to the persistently poor performance of the developed nations: the US, Europe and Japan.</p> <p>\u201cFor the past several years, the global recovery has been weak and fragile, and this continues to be the case today, especially for advanced economies,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/en/news/articles/2016/09/27/am16-sp09282016-boosting-growth-adjusting-to-change\" title=\"\">she said in a speech last week</a>. \u201cAnd while there are some good signs, the overall growth outlook still remains subdued.\u201d</p> <p>The IMF\u2019s concerns about Brexit stem, in part, from the knowledge that it would not take much for mediocre growth and low levels of inflation to turn into recession and deflation.</p> <h2><strong>Central banks are out of ammo</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc0deae97617fe169352d5b9b7117fbeec2a2f6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc0deae97617fe169352d5b9b7117fbeec2a2f6b/0_0_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Janet Yellen federal reserve\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There is speculation that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Global growth has been weak despite the best efforts of central banks. They have cut interest rates to record low rates and made repeated use of the money-creation process known as quantitative easing in an attempt to boost demand.</p> <p>This week\u2019s meeting take place against a backdrop of growing speculation that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year. But other central banks \u2013 the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank \u2013are moving in the opposite direction and providing additional stimulus.</p> <p>Lagarde has maintained a neutral position on a rise in US interest rates, but is known to fear the volatility a rate rise could bring \u2013 as money held in developing world banks, and even in London and Frankfurt, flows to the US in search of a safe return at a higher rate. She also thinks central banks are being asked to do too much, and that achieving higher levels of growth will require a three-pronged approach: monetary stimulus, tax cuts or spending increases from finance ministries, and structural reform.</p> <p>The IMF has urged countries which have the financial headroom to do so to spend money on growth-boosting public investment. <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2016/09/27/AM16-SP09282016-Boosting-Growth-Adjusting-to-Change\" title=\"\">In a recent speech</a>, Lagarde singled out Canada, Germany and South Korea as ones with plenty of spare cash. And this comes after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/24/imf-urges-uk-to-ease-austerity-should-economy-slow-further\" title=\"\">an IMF report at the beginning for the year called on the G20 nations</a>, including the UK, US, Mexico and Turkey, to ramp up their outlay on much-needed infrastructure projects.</p> <h2><strong>The ghost of protectionism</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f594d4fd4678795729d12bd675b954ebf12ef41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f594d4fd4678795729d12bd675b954ebf12ef41/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump\u2019s anti-free trade rhetoric is an alarming sign of moves towards trade barriers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The IMF was born out of the turmoil of the 1930s, when tit-for-tat protectionism amplified the effects of the Great Depression. Since its creation at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, the IMF has been at the forefront of attempts to reduce barriers to trade. It now views with alarm the ebb tide of globalisation, seen in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/trump-clinton-free-trade-policies-tpp\" title=\"\">anti free-trade rhetoric of Donald Trump</a>, the stalling of negotiations between Washington and Brussels on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ttip\" title=\"\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)</a> and the Brexit vote.</p> <p>The director general of the World Trade Organisation, Roberto Azev\u00eado, will join Lagarde in Washington this week to make the case for freer trade. The concern of both organisations is not just that there has been a gradual rise over the past four years in the number of protectionist measures introduced, but that there is a risk of an anti-trade narrative taking root, which says all the gains from openness are being captured by a tiny global elite.</p> <p>Lagarde says this mood is encouraged by growing inequality, and that tackling the divide between rich and poor would make it easier to negotiate trade deals and for governments to push for other structural reforms.</p> <h2><strong>A new debt crisis</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ddf3bc558ee963e7e64b4ab8e18468c814282e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ddf3bc558ee963e7e64b4ab8e18468c814282e1/0_120_2420_1452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children in Luanda\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angola is one of the countries that has asked the IMF and World Bank for help as growth and commodity prices fall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the past decade, the activities of the IMF have overshadowed those of its sister organisation, the World Bank, which also holds its annual meeting this week. The focus has been on the problems of the developed world \u2013 the sub-prime crisis, the near collapse of the banks, the threat to the euro and Brexit \u2013 rather than on the world\u2019s poorest countries, many of which had been growing rapidly as a result of booming commodity prices.</p> <p>Many poor countries borrowed heavily on the global capital markets during the good times but are now finding the environment far more hostile. Weak demand in the developed world has led to sharp falls in commodity prices and slower growth in developing countries. The World Bank expects growth in sub-Saharan Africa to be just 1.6% \u2013 the lowest in more than two decades.</p> <p>Angola, Kenya and Nigeria are among countries that have already turned to the IMF and the World Bank for help, and if growth remains weak others are likely to join them.</p> <p>The echoes of another age \u2013 one when the annual meetings were dominated by calls for debt relief \u2013 are getting louder.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "He\u2019s jumping without a parachute. After 31 years in the cosy world of John Lewis, the employee-owned department store\u2019s \u00a31m-a-year managing director, Andy Street, is checking out with no payoff in a bid to become mayor of the West Midlands. It is a mission of passion for the Birmingham-born Street, who is fascinated by politics and has high-profile friends in the House of Commons. The politics, philosophy and economics graduate privately expresses his admiration for London mayor Sadiq Khan, who switched from a high-flying law career to try to bring about real change through politics. Now Street, who will speak at the Tory conference starting in Birmingham , is clearly keen to do the same. But in his bid to become a Tory mayor in a Labour stronghold, Street is also leaving behind a department store heading into stormy waters. Operating profits at the chain, which is regarded as a bellwether for the UK economy, slumped 31% to \u00a332m in the first half of this year as it struggled to adapt to a fast-changing market in which shoppers increasingly expect to buy online for convenient delivery. Street\u2019s lack of pay-off contrasts strongly with the \u00a31.9m golden goodbye cheque collected by his former colleague Waitrose boss Mark Price when he exited - to become a Tory peer and trade minister - earlier this year. One source close to the business said Street\u2019s lack of a payoff could reflect the group\u2019s reluctance for him to leave at such short notice: he will be out of the business on 28 October, just a month after the company confirmed he would be leaving, while Price stayed on for six months after his resignation. But it\u2019s big leap for Street who is thought to be paid around \u00a31.1m a year. In his decade running the department store, Street has overseen major expansion and helped transform its image from a fusty middle-aged brand into Middle England\u2019s favourite shop. John Lewis only began advertising on TV the year that Street took over. Now its Christmas ad is a big event attracting millions of hits on social media. The chain also stocks more fashion, launching own labels with appeal to a younger audience such as Somerset by Alice Temperley and Kin. When Street took charge, John Lewis had opened just one store in six years. In his 10 years it has opened seven full-scale department stores, taking the total to 33, as well as 12 smaller \u201cat home\u201d outlets, an airport store at Heathrow and a small outlet in St Pancras International station. Sales have risen 70% to \u00a34.6bn and operating profits have risen 48% to \u00a3250m. It was Street\u2019s decision to maintain staff numbers and concentrate on service during the economic downturn \u2013 when others were cutting costs \u2013 that helped John Lewis win market share from its rivals. John Lewis\u2019s online strategy was kicked off in 2000 when the group bought the UK arm of buy.com. But Street\u2019s enthusiasm for innovation and technology has helped it outperform major rivals Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams. More than a third of all its merchandise is now sold online, and sales via the internet rose by 18% in the first half of this year. The business expects more than half of all sales to be online by 2020, and that produces new challenges: sales growth means investing hundreds of millions of pounds in the distribution infrastructure required for home deliveries \u2013 and each item sold online generates less profit because of all that behind-the-scenes work. \u201cThe writing is on the wall for department stores,\u201d says Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst. \u201cThey have got huge fixed costs. John Lewis has been bucking the trend with its incredible online growth, but it\u2019s not clear that has done anything for profits.\u201d He says Street\u2019s replacement should be a \u201cdifferent kind of guy, who\u2019s good at nitty-gritty focus on profits\u201d. With costs rising, he says \u2013 particularly after the Brexit vote, which has driven down the value of the pound \u2013 John Lewis will have to find cost-cuts that will not hit service. The group has already warned that it is likely to cut jobs over time and a A merger of head office functions with Waitrose may be on the cards. Most retail watchers expect Street\u2019s successor to be an insider, with retail director Mark Lewis and commercial director Paula Nickolds regarded as the frontrunners. Lewis, who only joined the department store in 2013, has a background at eBay and the parcel delivery company Collect+, both of which sectors are at the heart of the digital future. Nickolds, on the other hand, is a John Lewis \u201clifer\u201d who joined the partnership in 1994 as a graduate trainee, and is regarded as good product and people person. Whoever takes charge will need a command of online selling and a clear idea of how to keep shoppers coming into the stores, where sales are falling. The new boss may also need to take tough decisions on development plans. The new Waitrose boss has already ditched plans for new supermarkets as he faces up to the new retail world order. John Lewis is unlikely to close stores in the short term, but will have to think hard about how to use space. \u201cThe real challenge is going to be how to grow the business from this point onwards,\u201d says Maureen Hinton, group research director at retail analysts Verdict. \u201cIt really can\u2019t keep opening stores. The way to grow is by taking market share by being better than everybody else and sustaining that culture.\u201d",

The site was saved by a rescue deal in June led by Greybull, the family investment firm. It is now known as British Steel after the brand was bought from Tata Steel as part of the deal for Scunthorpe. Thomas\u2019s story highlights the devastating personal effect the closure of the steelworks would have had. Employing more than 4,000 people, making it the largest private employer in the area, the site looms large in the Lincolnshire town, and its scale takes the breath away. The perimeter of the steelworks measures more than 15 miles and the site covers 2,000 acres \u2013 a similar size to Scunthorpe itself. Inside there are more than 100 miles of railway line and 40 miles of road, but the site is dominated by the four blast furnaces and two cooling towers. The blast furnaces are named after British queens: Elizabeth I \u2013 or Bess as the workers call it \u2013 Anne, Victoria and Mary. In a sign of the pressure still on the industry, only Anne and Victoria are operational at present, but it is clear the steelworkers take great pride in what they do. \u201cI love it. It\u2019s a fantastic place. No two days are the same,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cI am proud to say I work at the steelworks.\u201d Thomas, who has been on the staff here since he was 18, wants the Scunthorpe plant to become a beacon for the global industry in terms of quality and efficiency. \u201cI want us to be the benchmark,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is my personal drive, where I would like to get to.\u201d British Steel revealed last week that the steelworks is back in profit just 100 days after it was bought from Tata. Roland Junck, the executive chairman, said the former owners had \u201clost interest\u201d in the plan. The new company has focused on cutting costs \u2013 workers took a 3% pay cut; rebuilding its relationship with customers, which include Network Rail, Toyota, and Transport for London; and trying to become more specialised in the type of steel it produces. \u201cThere have been some dark times,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cIt does grind you down and you start to worry about your job and what the future might hold. It was pretty obvious that we were not part of its [Tata Steel\u2019s] model going forward.\u201d Thomas said returning to the British Steel name was the \u201cright thing to do\u201d. The name disappeared in 1999 when British Steel merged with a Dutch rival to become Corus. Corus was bought by Tata in 2007 for \u00a36.2bn. Workers at the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales will look longingly at the new optimism evident in Scunthorpe. Port Talbot is the only other steelworks in Britain with a blast furnace \u2013 which means it can make steel from raw materials \u2013 and the site dominates the small Welsh town even more than its Lincolnshire counterpart does. However, its future remains shrouded in uncertainty as Tata Steel considers whether to keep it, close it, or sell it off . Paul McBean, chair of the Scunthorpe steelworks trade unions, said workers in Lincolnshire had gone through \u201c14 months of sheer hell\u201d until the rescue deal with Greybull was agreed. \u201cWhen I go into town I get patted on the back for the work I put in, which is nice,\u201d he adds. However, British Steel still has a lot of work to do to deliver sustainable profits. The company wants the government to offer financial support by lowering business rates, controlling energy costs, stopping the dumping of cheap steel imports from China and offering contracts to British Steel on public projects. McBean says politicians visit the steelworks then go back to London and forget about it: \u201cSomeone, someday is eventually going to have to give in and deliver.\u201d There are also concerns about Greybull after other businesses it controls running into trouble. My Local, the convenience store business, collapsed this summer while the future of Monarch, the low-cost airline, is also in doubt. McBean says they have the support of workers in Scunthorpe. \u201cDo I still have faith in our investors? Yes I do.\u201d While there may be doubts about Greybull, at least the Scunthorpe steelworks can now look to the future.",

      "bodyText": "Alex Polonsky was watching Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts lay into Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive, John Stumpf, on 20 September when he finally had enough. He picked up the phone and called Jonathan Delshad, who would soon become his lawyer. Polonsky used to work for Wells Fargo, but according to his lawsuit, he was demoted and later terminated for not meeting his sales quotas. The bank has recently come under scrutiny for such quotas after it was revealed that for years, thousands of its employees had been opening unauthorized accounts in order to meet them. More than 2m such accounts were opened without customers\u2019 permission and more than 5,300 Wells Fargo employees have been fired \u2013 with about 1,000 being dismissed each year over the past five years. At the same time, employees like Polonsky were fired for not meeting their quotas. \u201cHe was like: I got fired because I would not engage in this kind of behavior. They pushed me to meet my quotas, meet my quotas, and I kept telling them: what you are asking me to do is open accounts for people that do not want them. You are asking me to do stuff that does not make sense,\u201d said Delshad, Polonsky\u2019s lawyer, recalling their phone conversation. \u201cWhen he called me asking for representation, I said, \u2018I am sure you are not the only one out there.\u2019 We got another class action named client [Brian] Zaghi and filed the class action lawsuit.\u201d The bank has apologized for the unauthorized accounts and recently announced a $185m settlement with US regulators. Stumpf has taken a hot seat before the US Senate and House of Representatives. Yet the bank\u2019s troubles are just beginning. In addition to Polonsky\u2019s lawsuit on behalf of employees fired for not meeting quotas, other lawsuits by shareholders, investors and customers were filed in September. The Department of Labor is investigating the bank for possible retaliation against whistleblowers \u2013 employees who called an ethics line regarding the unauthorized accounts and were later fired. Reputation experts have been tripping over themselves in an effort to comment on the situation even as Democrats and Republicans have united in their outrage over the bank\u2019s practices. Democrats have once again begun beating the drum on breaking up big banks, claiming that Wells Fargo is too large to manage, given that the practice of opening unauthorized accounts has gone on for years. In the speech that captured Polonsky\u2019s attention, Warren called on Stumpf to resign, return the money he \u201ctook while this scam was going on\u201d and submit to investigation by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the same hearing, Stumpf noted that his salary for 2015 was $19.3m. Days after the hearing, Stumpf suggested to the Wells Fargo compensation board that they claw back his pay. And they did \u2013 asking him to forfeit his salary while the board launches another investigation into the bank\u2019s sales practices, going back to 2009. Stumpf was also asked to forfeit $41m worth of unvested equity awards. Carrie Tolstedt, who oversaw retail banking at Wells Fargo during the time when the accounts were created, also forfeited $19m in such awards and will receive no severance after retiring this summer. She is still likely to walk away with about $77m. Warren called these clawbacks in pay a \u201csmall step in the right direction\u201d. \u201cWells Fargo employees who failed to meet management\u2019s outrageous sales goals were fired. Wells Fargo employees who tried to sound the alarm about the creation of fake accounts were fired. Their lives turned upside down,\u201d she tweeted the day after the board\u2019s announcement. \u201cStumpf will be just fine: he keeps his job and most of the money he made while massive fraud went on under his nose.\u201d As of this weekend, the bank has terminated its sales quotas. Yet that does little to appease former employees who were fired for not meeting them in the past. Wells Fargo told the Guardian it did not have a number for how many employees were fired for not meeting their quotas. As for Polonsky\u2019s lawsuit, the bank is not going down without a fight. \u201cWe disagree with the allegations in the complaint and will vigorously defend against the misrepresentations it contains about Wells Fargo and all of the Wells Fargo team members whose careers have been built on doing the right thing by our customers every day,\u201d a Wells Fargo spokeswoman told the Guardian. To Delshad, that kind of response is \u201csad\u201d \u2013 after all, these were employees who \u201cwithheld from doing illegal practices\u201d to meet their quotas. \u201cWhereas the average bank had three products per customer, Wells Fargo had six, and was not happy with that. They pushed for a goal of eight per customer. To reach this goal, Wells Fargo placed knowingly unrealistic and impossible cross sell quotas on their bankers,\u201d the lawsuit filed on behalf of Polonsky and Zaghi claims. The biggest victims of this scheme are a class of people that nobody else has talked about. The biggest victims of Wells Fargo\u2019s scam is the class of victims that were fired because they did not meet these cross sell quotas by engaging in the fraudulent scam that would line the CEO\u2019s pockets. Wells Fargo \u201cnever had a target of eight\u201d products per customer, Stumpf told US lawmakers on Thursday. The number was meant to be \u201caspirational\u201d and provide a framework for the employees as to what to strive for when sitting down with customers. The quotas were \u201cmisunderstood\u201d and used by some former employees to break ethics codes, said Stumpf. Was it stealing when they moved money from one account to another without permission? In some cases, yes, Stumpf noted, reluctantly. It has been over three weeks since the $185m settlement was announced and the bank\u2019s illegal sales practices came into the spotlight. The bank continues to insist that the unauthorized accounts were not part of an \u201corchestrated effort\u201d. Scapegoating of employees could be what hurts the bank the most, according to Matt Moscardi, head of financial sector research at MSCI. Blaming former employees and having previously fired those who did not meet quotas could lead to a significant drop in productivity \u2013 which would translate into a drop in revenue. \u201cCustomers are less likely to move. What\u2019s likely to move is employees and that\u2019s a big problem,\u201d said Moscardi. Wells Fargo\u2019s retail customers are less likely to swap banks over the scandal than big corporate clients who might be concerned about their reputation. However, Wells Fargo suffered a blow this week when the California state treasurer announced it was cutting its ties with the bank for the next 12 months. Whether that will be enough of an incentive for change remains to be seen. As for Stumpf, he said California had been Wells Fargo\u2019s home for 64 years and the bank was doing its best to regain its customers\u2019 trust. \u201cI am now giving all of my energy to leading this company,\u201d Stumpf said on Thursday, trying to reassure the US lawmakers. \u201cI love this company. I spend all of my waking hours thinking of this company.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tupperware, the brand long associated in the US with 1950s housewives and a time of limited economic prospects for women, has found a successful market in another place with troubling gender dynamics: modern-day Brazil. Even with the recent economic collapse and political instability in Brazil, sales are up 22% in US dollars in the second quarter, says Rick Goings, CEO of Tupperware. Brazil, which has the world\u2019s fifth largest population, has become a major source of revenue growth for a company that generates 92% of its business outside the US. And the method Tupperware uses to make sure its success in Brazil stays on track? Keeping its sellers\u2019 husbands happy. Tupperware\u2019s sales strategy depends on direct selling. The company gives women micro-loans to purchase their food storage and other kitchen-related products, which the women then demonstrate and sell to their social networks. If they are successful, they move up to become unit managers, supervising other saleswomen and eventually, if they continue to do well, they become distributors who oversee several unit managers. While turnover in the first rank of the salesforce is very high, Goings acknowledges, turnover for distributors is only around 10%. The direct sales model can be particularly attractive to Brazilian women. Sexual harassment in the workplace and domestic abuse are rampant in Brazil, says Brodwyn Fischer, professor of Latin American history and director of the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Chicago. While there is an idealized image for the poor and lower middle class in Brazil that men work and take care of their wives, women who are in those classes have always had to work in order to make ends meet, Fischer says. Direct selling, especially at the initial levels, is seen as \u201cwomen\u2019s money\u201d and not an official job that would threaten a man\u2019s position, Fischer explains. It can allow women to become financially independent and help the household but in a way that does not require them to keep regular business hours or leave the house all the time. Tupperware has worked to be sensitive to that gender dynamic, with the company making sure to find a role for the husbands of women who have climbed the ladder to become major distributors. For a company whose pitch is the empowerment of women \u2013 Goings himself is part of the UN Women\u2019s HeForShe initiative \u2013 the CEO spends a lot of time focusing on the needs of men. Tupperware encourages the husbands of women who become successful distributors for the company to take on roles in the administration and operations of their wives\u2019 distributor networks. As the women become more financially successful and their confidence grows, Tupperware spends \u201ca lot of time trying to teach them how to carry it well, to be sensitive to the dynamic of the husband\u201d, Goings explains. When the top distributors go on a company-sponsored trip, the husbands come with them, the company will include photos of both the husband and wife on promotional materials, and when the women are invited on stage at company events, the husbands are on stage with them, Goings says. Reversing an old saying, Goings says that \u201cbehind these dynamic, successful women is a man\u201d. Most men adjust to their wife\u2019s success, says Goings, as their own quality of life improves, and he credits the women\u2019s new financial independence with lowering instances of domestic violence. Tupperware, and fellow American direct selling company Avon, are not the only ones finding success by tapping into the motivated female population of the country who are looking for other ways to earn money. Direct selling is actually not new in Brazil. In fact, a local company, Natura, that makes soaps, perfumes and other natural products, already counts an astonishing 1.9 million Brazilians among its direct selling workforce. Entrepreneurship of any kind is attractive to women in Brazil, says Fischer, in part because it means women don\u2019t have to deal with workplace sexism, which is prevalent, and also means women can run their business the way they see fit and pay themselves, eliminating any wage gap. The informality of a direct selling job that does not depend on either the government or a company directly for regular employment also fits into Brazilian history of stringing together work to put food on the table, Fischer says. While Brazil is currently in the throes of an economic recession as well as political unrest, and just in August impeached President Dilma Rousseff, Tupperware continues to see sales growth. Goings credits Brazilians\u2019 culture of optimism, their lack of confidence in their government, and their large population of young people open to entrepreneurship as part of the reason for Tupperware\u2019s success. Brazilians, Goings says, \u201cdon\u2019t sit on their hands waiting for the government to come up with programs\u201d. Goings is a huge believer in the entrepreneurial spirit of the young. He can cite statistics on millennial entrepreneurial behaviors and gets excited talking about self-reliance. It all goes back to his theories of work and government. Goings believes that the lack of confidence in the government and belief in entrepreneurship as the way to economic independence that he sees in Brazil is something \u201cyou are going to see repeated over and over in the world. I believe that Brazil could be a vanguard of what a new template could look like for individuals taking responsibility for improvement for life in their hands,\u201d Goings explains. When it comes to governments in Europe, \u201cyou are dealing with governments that are going broke\u201d, he says, and the current political climate in the US is an indicator of things gone wrong, he explains, adding: \u201cI hope what comes together is more people that get an attitude that we have to figure out these answers ourselves as individuals.\u201d",
