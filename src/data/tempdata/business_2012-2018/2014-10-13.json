      "bodyText": "The weakest underlying performance by high street and online stores since the depth of the 2008-09 recession provided fresh evidence on Tuesday of a slowdown in the economy. An unusually warm September, the continued weakness of spending in supermarkets and a dip in the rapid growth of internet sales meant spending dropped sharply last month, the British Retail Consortium said. In its monthly health check conducted jointly with KPMG, the BRC said total sales were 0.8% lower in September 2014 than in the same month a year earlier. The year-on-year drop in consumer spending was the most pronounced since December 2008, apart from months affected by the timing of Easter. The BRC took comfort from the fact that spending on big-ticket items such as furniture continued to be strong, but the report comes after a slew of recent data pointing to an easing of activity in the second half of 2014. The chancellor, George Osborne, said last week that the problems of the eurozone were already having an impact on the UK economy, and the Bank of England is also detecting signs that the rapid pace of growth seen since the spring of 2013 will not be maintained. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, said in interviews in Washington that stalling growth in the eurozone would be only one of the factors that would affect the timing of an increase in interest rates but accepted that slower global growth would bear down on inflation. After the recent run of data, the City is now expecting the first increase in borrowing costs to be in the middle of 2015, around the time of the general election. Carney said the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee would not be swayed by political considerations. Helen Dickinson, the director general of the British Retail Consortium, said: \u201cIn September, we saw the lowest retail sales figures since December 2008, excluding Easter distortions. This can be attributed to a number of factors including the continuing decline in food sales. Furthermore, there was exceptionally low demand for items such as boots and coats, resulting in the lowest fashion sales performance since April 2012. However, demand for big-ticket items continues to be strong, with furniture outperforming all other categories.\u201d David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, said sales of winter fashion lines had been affected by September\u2019s Indian summer. \u201cSelling woolly jumpers in warm weather is a tough ask, even for the most talented of sales staff.\u201d Like-for-like sales \u2013 which strip out the impact of increases from new shop openings \u2013 were 2.1% down on a year earlier. In the three months to September \u2013 considered a better guide to the underlying trend than the figures for one month \u2013 like-for-like sales of food were 3.6% down on the same months of 2013, while like-for-like sales in all categories were 0.5% weaker. McCorquodale said: \u201cAfter a bumper summer, this is a disappointing outcome for retailers and has undoubtedly reversed some of the sales gains made in August. However, if temperatures drop to a more seasonal level this cooler weather will quickly turn around retailers\u2019 fortunes and help them to sell their autumn-winter ranges. \u201cThe grocers had another challenging month, with further price cuts and promotions announced by most. With a rebasing of margins in the grocery sector throughout the year, this final quarter will see sales go to those who are most focused on their customers.\u201d While online retail activity now accounts for more than one pound in every six spent by consumers, online non-food sales are growing less strongly than they were a year ago, the BRC/KPMG retail sales monitor showed. Sales were 8.2% up on September 2013, while they were increasing at an annual rate of 13.4% a year ago. Carney told CNN news that the Bank of England had already forecast that Britain\u2019s growth rates would slow slightly towards the end of 2014, and the Bank would continue to keep a close eye on domestic inflation pressures that might come from the strong pick-up in wages in the tightening labour market. In the three months ending in June, gross domestic product increased by 0.9%. Carney said in a separate interview with CNBC television that the slowdown in Europe\u2019s recovery did not compare with the scale of the crisis in the single currency zone in recent years when Greece was at risk of dropping out of the euro. \u201cThis is a chronic phase of European adjustment,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWe\u2019re not back in the acute phase, back into that period of a couple of years ago.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ecotricity, one of the new breed of independent energy suppliers, has teamed up with Skanska, the construction group, in a bid to build \u00a3500m worth of onshore windfarms in the UK within five years. Dale Vince, the founder of Ecotricity, said it had taken his firm 17 years to build capacity that generates 70 megawatts of wind power but he was hoping to construct 100MW of schemes \u2013 enough to power 57,000 homes \u2013 every year. He admitted the major expansion plans could be affected if the Conservatives win the general election next year and pressed ahead with plans to drastically reduce onshore wind energy. \u201cObviously it is a concern but we are still confident that anything (windfarms) in planning up until the end of next summer should be immune from political risk,\u201d he explained. Vince said the new joint venture with Skanska, titled Skylark, would combine Ecotricity\u2019s skills in winning planning consents for projects with the construction company\u2019s ability to build them and bring in large investors. \u201cEcotricity were the world\u2019s first green electricity company, while Skanska aims to be the greenest construction company in the world \u2013 our shared pursuit of sustainability and our complementary skill sets creates a strong partnership. Steve Cooper, a director at Skanska Infrastructure Development, said the involvement with Ecotricity helped it to meet its wider green agenda. The company has worked on redevelopments at St Bartholomew\u2019s hospital in London and on the M25. Skanska has also built two large windfarms in its native Sweden. Ecotricity, like some other independent suppliers, has seen its retail supply business take off as customers leave the big six firms which have dominated the sector for so long. It has doubled its number of customers over the last 12 months to 150,000 and hopes to hit 200,000 by next April, but admits such fast growth poses a challenge to retaining the best levels of service. \u201cWe are coping well,\u201d said Vince, \u201cbut we have had to double our staff to 500 to keep up.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\u2018As far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d says Isis\u2019s mastermind and figurehead, \u201cit\u2019s an Egyptian goddess from about 3,000 years before Christ. We\u2019ve been here 30 years. Where have this lot bloody come from, anyway?\u201d If this is a surprisingly colloquial bit of phrasing, it may clear things up a bit to note that the mastermind in question is not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but John Dixon, of Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire; and the organisation is not an Islamist militant group operating with murderous abandon in Syria and Iraq, but a picture framers with a sideline in restoration and conservation. Still, even if John got there first, there is little doubt that the terrorist upstarts have taken centre stage. In the past few months, a term whose most sinister associations used to be a mythological figure and a river in Oxford has taken on a different set of connotations. And John is not alone. Only this weekend, the creator of the American spy-comedy animation Archer said that he had been forced to write the International Secret Intelligence Service out of his show. \u201cI gave my Dad one of the Isis hats,\u201d the show\u2019s Adam Reed said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018You know son, I\u2019m not going to be able to wear the hat anymore. I\u2019m getting looks at the hardware store.\u2019\u201d You might also feel for Ann Summers, forced to make the not-totally-surprising disclaimer that its Isis-branded smalls should not be read as an endorsement of terrorism. Or there\u2019s the Isis mobile payments system, launched over the summer in the US before a swift rethink prompted a change to the name Softcard instead. And consider Downton Abbey\u2019s poor old labrador, whose opportunities for screen time might, you fear, now be rather more limited after the injunction to Richard E Grant\u2019s character to \u201cstop flirting with Isis\u201d \u2013 meaning the dog, rather than radicalisation. (A spokesperson insists that there are no plans to change the name.) More seriously, perhaps, there are myriad small businesses in the UK \u2013 at least 100 listed on Yell, the online business directory, alone. As the horrors of recent months have unfolded on our TV screens and our leaders have wrestled with the idea of military action, such companies have had to confront a rather more prosaic question: what do you do when the terrorists steal your brand? That the problem is a pressing one quickly becomes apparent when you try to talk to people about it: there\u2019s something strange, these days, about hearing someone pick up the phone and say brightly: \u201cHello, Isis, how can I help you?\u201d At the Isis hair salon in Blackpool, owner David was astonished to find his business the subject of online gossip in town. \u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a nightmare,\u201d he says. \u201cI had a client last week who said she told someone she was getting a haircut and her friend said, \u2018You\u2019re not going there, are you?\u2019\u201d On the shop\u2019s Facebook page, one punter commented on a picture of the storefront: \u201cWhy would you have your hair cut there?\u201d \u201cAnd we had a lad ring up saying: \u2018Can I join up?\u2019\u201d David remembers. He thinks it was a joke. \u201cI should have said, \u2018I\u2019ll meet you at Fleetwood Docks at 3am\u2019.\u201d Then there\u2019s Jill Campbell, who has run Isis Boutique in Malvern, Worcestershire, for seven years, and who now says she is seriously considering a name-change after hearing someone outside the shop say: \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who have been beheading everybody.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m now in the position of thinking do I change the name or do I stick it out?\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cIt\u2019s an unsettling time.\u201d Of course, it\u2019s quite striking that Campbell was photographed in her shop when the news broke; as marketing consultant Mark Borkowski points out, \u201cin every crisis, there\u2019s an opportunity\u201d. He doesn\u2019t see the name itself as a problem if the firm is long established \u2013 even if, he says, in a piece of heroic understatement, \u201cIsis is very much a Marmite brand at the moment.\u201d It would be an issue, Borkowski argues, should a new company choose that name today. Others have agreed in similar circumstances: ask Yew Tree Grooming, a pet salon still trading under that name in Manchester, or the man behind London concrete business Jim\u2019ll Mix It, who defiantly shrugged off the Savile connection when he told the Financial Times in 2012: \u201cI am who I am. I\u2019m in concrete, my name\u2019s Jim.\u201d Taste aside, though, Borkowski sees another big problem: \u201cGoogling it, there are no businesses on the first page. If you\u2019re selling your wares on the internet you\u2019d have to take a long hard look at that, because the white noise around the name is getting in the way. It might be better to tell the world you\u2019re changing your name.\u201d Derek Barker, editor of a 30-year-old Bob Dylan magazine called you-know-what (after one of Dylan\u2019s songs), has experienced the search engine issue for himself. \u201cPage after page is about Islamic State now,\u201d he says ruefully. \u201cWe\u2019re umpteen pages down the list. We could do without it, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d He\u2019s seen some other surprising consequences. One magazine recently shipped to a US subscriber was torn open by a customs official who presumably wondered if this was a particularly unsubtle bit of jihadi propaganda. Still, Barker doesn\u2019t think he faces enough of a problem to warrant a name-change, since his readers are mostly longstanding customers. By and large, smaller businesses seem to have concluded that it\u2019s simply not worth the trouble. Carol Graham, who runs the Isis pub in Sunderland, weighed it up \u201cafter quite a lot of hostile comments to our face and on Facebook, people posting links to terrorist stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve just deleted it all. It\u2019s absolutely crazy.\u201d In the end, though, \u201cthe cost implications just make it a nightmare. Everything we\u2019ve got says \u2018Isis\u2019 on it.\u201d Like several other of the business owners interviewed, she\u2019s pinning her hopes on Isil or Islamic State becoming the dominant term. And if that doesn\u2019t work out, you can always look on the bright side. Isobel Scott, who runs Isis Hypnotherapy in Hertfordshire, says that she doesn\u2019t want to change her name for a bunch of murderers \u2013 and adds: \u201cIt did cross my mind that some of the people Googling it would come across my page \u2013 they\u2019re certainly people that need some therapy.\u201d As for John Dixon, there\u2019s some consolation in not being an imitator. \u201cThey\u2019ll lose their street cred, them evil people over there,\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cI mean, they\u2019ve named themselves after a picture framer.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 October 2014.

      "bodyText": "Despite a wobble when Wall Street moved into negative territory during the afternoon, European markets have, for the most part, managed to keep their heads above water after recent declines. Mining companies supported the FTSE 100, following upbeat Chinese trade data, while in Europe airlines benefited from the continuing falls in the oil price. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 26.27 points or 0.41% higher at 6366.24 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.27% to 8812.43 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.12% higher at 4078.70 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dipped 0.32% to 19,139.08 as the Bank of Italy said it saw downside risks to the government\u2019s 2015 GDP forecasts Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.36% better at 10,187.3 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 22 points or 0.14%. And with that, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann continues to be at odds with ECB president Mario Draghi over how much stimulus the bank should provide to prop up the ailing eurozone economy, judging by his latest comments today. Weidmann is also unhappy at the idea of France postponing its adherence to EU budget deficit targets until 2017. According to Reuters he said: In the event of further violation of the deficit limit by France, the credibility of the EU budget rules would be damaged if the commission were not to intensify action. Here\u2019s the Reuters take on Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s comments: The economic risks in the euro zone are tipped to the downside and the ratings outlook may not reflect this, Standard and Poor\u2019s chief sovereign ratings officer Moritz Kraemer said on Monday. \u201dThe risks are probably to the downside in the euro zone. The ratings outlook does not reflect it in such a clear way,\u201d said Kraemer, during a webcast to discuss the agency\u2019s downgrade of France\u2019s rating outlook late on Friday. \u201dWe have three positive outlooks and three negative outlooks but if you look beneath just the mere numbers you will see that the sovereigns with a positive outlook in combination are economies which account for less that 3% of eurozone GDP, whereas those with a negative outlook account for a combined 38% of GDP.\u201d S&amp;P has a positive outlook for Ireland, Cyprus and Slovakia and a negative outlook for France, Italy and Slovenia. More rating agency downgrades may be on the way, judging by this: Incidentally, S&amp;P\u2019s next scheduled reports are Portugal on 7 November and Spain a week later. The current worries about the health of the global economy are overdone, for the most part, according to Capital Economics. The economic research group\u2019s Julian Jessop said there were four main areas of concern, the most worrying being the signs of a renewed downturn in the eurozone, Germany in particular. He said: There are a number of ways in which the deep-rooted problems in the euro-zone could play out. The single currency could muddle through, as it has for many years. But our feeling is that more extreme outcomes are still on the cards, including an eventual break-up. In any event, it is hard to see any solution that does not involve additional easing by the ECB and further euro weakness in the coming months. We are less worried about the second concern, namely the collapse in the oil price. This slump is partly a reflection of weak demand from Europe and China, but it is mainly due to booming supply and has been compounded by dollar strength and panic selling. As such, the collapse in oil prices overstates the weakness of world economy. And whatever the reasons for the fall, lower energy costs should actually help to kick-start global growth. Overall, we expect the price of Brent to recover a little by year-end, perhaps to $93 per barrel from the current $88, before heading lower once more (our end-2015 and end-2016 forecasts are $85 and $80, respectively). The third global concern is the slowdown in the major emerging economies. But this is essentially old news. The bulk of this slowdown took place between 2010 and 2012, since when growth has actually been relatively stable. Admittedly, China\u2019s growth may have weakened a little further in the third quarter\u2013 perhaps to sub-7%. But this would still be a decent and probably healthier pace. Overall, our view is that a lot of the bad news for commodity prices \u2013 especially metals \u2013 is now surely priced in. The final source of concern is a host of worries under the general umbrella of \u201cgeo-political risks\u201d, to which we must now add fears over the Ebola outbreak. We think the bulk of these worries are overdone, but again it could be Europe that provides the biggest shocks. Political developments in the UK and France are worth watching especially closely. In particular, the rise of UKIP could force an early referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the EU, with any talk of British exit sending shockwaves across the region. What\u2019s more, even if we are right that global growth fears soon start to fade \u2013 helped if necessary by additional stimulus in the euro-zone and China \u2013 the focus could simply return to the prospects of an earlier tightening of monetary policy in the US. This should see Treasury yields resume their upward trend and keep market volatility generally high. Following the latest surveillance visit to Spain by European Commission staff, the EC and ECB concluded the situation was improving but further reforms were needed: The recent economic and financial developments confirm the positive trends of stabilisation that have been unfolding over the last two years. However, it will be important to remain vigilant, as the large imbalances from the pre-crisis period and the related policy challenges in the labour market and beyond are still substantial. Full and effective implementation of the reform agenda and, where needed, its further strengthening, is paramount and often requires joint delivery by various tiers of government, as well as close monitoring of outcomes from the reforms. With markets in positive territory for a change, Wall Street is joining in the mini-rally. In early trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 44 points or 0.27%, helping to support the earlier rises on European markets. As the Eurogroup meets in Luxembourg ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Ecofin get-together, one of the items on the agenda is the French budget. The country was granted an extra two years until 2015 to bring its budget shortfall below the EU ceiling of 3% of GDP. But in September France said it would not meet the 2015 deadline but would aim instead for 2017. Jeroen Dijssellbloem, chair of the eurozone finance ministers, said on Friday it should not be given extra time, and ahead of the Eurogroup meeting he continues to express his doubts: https://twitter.com/FGoria/status/521642552077086720 Meanwhile Italy seems more optimistic about its own prospects: Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened so far: UK income tax revenues are likely to come in lower than expected, public finances watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility has warned Stock markets continue to be volatile but have edged higher after earlier falls France\u2019s Jean Tirole has won the Nobel prize for economics (technically The 2014 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel). Follow our separate live blog Bank of England governor Mark Carney says eurozone weakness will not dictate UK monetary policy Most European banks are likely to pass the ECB\u2019s assessments, says Fitch And here\u2019s the latest market update: In a note entitled Deutschlanding, Credit Suisse analysts say the recent poor data from Germany shows how imbalanced its economy is, with its bias towards exports: Recent euro area data suggest that a slowdown in cyclical momentum has lurched into sharp recession: in August German industrial output fell as precipitously as it did during the Great Recession. That collapse in production is more statistical artefact than reality, in our view. The euro area and German economies have slowed, but are not in recession. Industrial production data should reverse their falls in the autumn. But, still, something has happened, even if recent data are an exaggeration. Reliable indicators do point to a slowdown in German manufacturing, in part driven by its hitherto successful capital goods sector. We\u2019d attribute that to slower demand growth in Asia and a knock to exporters\u2019 confidence from the imposition of sanctions on Russia. We think this marks an important shift. Germany is perhaps the world\u2019s most imbalanced economy: biased towards exports and with a current account surplus worth 7% of GDP. Those imbalances have until now driven significant economic (out)performance. But external demand has turned less supportive. That points to a gradual erosion of Germany\u2019s trade and current account surplus and, in turn, a headwind against German GDP growth from net trade. The key question is what that means for growth, in both Germany and the euro area. In the short term, slower German growth is likely to keep euro area GDP growth anaemic, given how insipid the recovery is in the rest of the euro area. So far, negative feedback from weaker external to domestic demand in Germany and the rest of the euro area looks limited. Although some further deterioration is likely, it may be offset other factors pushing for an improvement in euro area domestic demand dynamics. Still, insipid GDP growth and diminishing external demand require stronger domestic stimulus. The political will for, let alone implementation of, looser fiscal policy is still absent. That leaves monetary policy: we continue to expect the ECB to broaden its asset purchases to sovereign debt, possibly early next year. Another mechanism to offset this would be a weaker currency. The recent drop in the euro can help, but a larger decline would be necessary to deliver a meaningful change to the euro area\u2019s growth dynamics. As it happens, such a fall would likely benefit the export sector in other euro area economies rather than Germany. Meanwhile: The majority of European banks are likely to pass the ECB\u2019s stress tests, according to ratings agency Fitch. It said: We expect the majority of banks to pass the assessment, and many of those that fail could be technical failures, in the sense that capital shortfalls have either already been addressed in 2014 or capital is easily sourced from within a banking group. Only a small minority of institutions are likely to have a headline capital shortfall that means they will need to establish plans to raise capital or reduce assets by the middle of 2015. But the assessments, due to be published on 26 October, are not the end of it, and Fitch estimated it would cost another \u20ac235bn to raise reserves enough to cover impaired loans for all banks to around 80%. It said: The ECB\u2019s comprehensive assessment is only a first step in levelling the playing field for banks\u2019 access to private sector funds and ability to extend lending. High levels of unreserved problem loans will leave some banks, particularly in weaker countries, still vulnerable, Fitch Ratings says. There is a strong correlation between banks with the weakest balance sheets and weak eurozone sovereigns. Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain made up more than two thirds of unreserved impaired loans at end of the first half of 2014. The banks with the highest unreserved impaired loans relative to capital tend to be from peripheral eurozone countries. Capitalisation has strengthened notably for most of the 130 banks undergoing the assessment since the last EU-wide stress test in 2011. This has continued into 2014, with reported equity for the banks in the exercise rising by around \u20ac65bn in the first half of 2014, including common equity raising of around \u20ac31bn. The banks also issued \u20ac15bn of additional Tier 1 securities, with further progress in the third quarter of 2014. We expect further capital increases and restructuring to follow the comprehensive assessment at the banks identified as the weakest. Despite this, balance sheet strength will remain dependent on collateral valuation. Further progress will be needed in the first few years of the single supervisory mechanism to strengthen the balance sheet of weaker banks. We estimate it would cost around \u20ac70bn to raise reserve coverage of impaired loans for all banks undergoing the assessment to 60%. Upping coverage to a very solid (and arguably conservative) level of 80% would cost around \u20ac235bn. We certainly do not expect this much capital to be injected into the system during the next few years. The numbers do, however, give a strong indication of the importance of remaining vigilant about collateral valuation when assessing banks. Here\u2019s the Reuters take on Carney\u2019s latest comments: Euro zone weakness will be only one factor that helps to determine when the British central bank raises interest rates, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in interviews broadcast on Monday. Carney told U.S. news channel CNN that weakness in the euro zone and elsewhere had been a major theme at the International Monetary Fund\u2019s meetings in Washington, but that Britain\u2019s recovery had been driven primarily by domestic factors. \u201cThe only difficulty that is caused by Europe is that it provides an additional drag on growth. But that doesn\u2019t dictate the monetary policy of the Bank of England,\u201d he said. Carney added that the BoE had already forecast that Britain\u2019s rapid recovery would slow slightly towards the end of 2014, and would continue to keep a close eye on domestic inflation pressures that might come from the labour market. Carney said in a separate interview with CNBC television that weaker global demand was producing a \u201cvery benign global inflationary environment and that is something that we do certainly take into account.\u201d Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been on CNN, suggesting the recent weakness in the eurozone might have an effect on the timing of UK interest rates, but it will not dictate policy. Here are the snaps of his comments, courtesy Reuters: 13-Oct-2014 11:04 - BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S CARNEY SAYS WILL TAKE EURO ZONE WEAKNESS INTO ACCOUNT IN THINKING ON INTEREST RATES - CNN 13-Oct-2014 11:05 - BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S CARNEY SAYS DOMESTIC FACTORS HAVE BEEN DRIVING UK RECOVERY 13-Oct-2014 11:06 - BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S CARNEY SAYS NEED TO ASSESS WHETHER UK ECONOMY WILL SLOW SLIGHTLY AT END OF 2014 - CNN 13-Oct-2014 11:07 - BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S CARNEY SAYS EURO ZONE WEAKNESS DOES NOT DICTATE MONETARY POLICY OF BOE 13-Oct-2014 11:08 - BANK OF ENGLAND\u2019S CARNEY SAYS BOE WILL IGNORE DATE OF UK ELECTION WHEN SETTING POLICY - CNN The Bank is widely expected to be the first of the major central banks to begin to raise interest rates after months of record lows, but these comments sound a little more dovish than of late. Back in the corporate world, and Smith &amp; Nephew has disappointed investors with news that a novel spray on skin treatment to help heal leg ulcers has failed in a late stage clinical trial. The product - designated HP802-247 - consists of living cells which are designed to work with the body\u2019s own cells, but despite the failure of the trial in North America, a phase 3 study in Europe is due to report in 2016. But the outcome of this latest test is a particular disappointment given earlier successful trials. Analyst Nicholas Keher at Investec said: Phase 2b results were published in June 2011 and showed positive results, meeting both primary and secondary end points with a significant improvement over the gold standard treatment. The company therefore needs to determine why those results could not be repeated in the larger phase 3 trial in North America and whether they should attempt the trial again. A second phase 3 trial is currently underway in the EU, which is expected to report in May 2016 and Smith &amp; Nephew will continue to review the HP802 program whilst this trial continues. We had assumed HP802 would launch in 2017 with 6% peak penetration in 2021, leading to peak revenues of $230m, thus there are no changes within our forecast period. However our price target reduces to 1023p from 1100p as we increase the risk adjustment on HP802 to only a 25% chance of success (the product could still launch in the US if the US trial is repeated, but also in the EU if the Phase 3 trial there is successful) and we reduce our recommendation to hold from add. The Nobel Prize for Economics - technically The 2014 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel - is expected to be announced around noon (BST). My colleague Graeme Wearden is now covering the event, and his live blog is now up and running. With no major economic data due today, and US bond markets closed for Columbus Day, it is likely to be another uncertain day on the markets. Indeed, European markets have now edged into positive territory after their early falls, with airlines lifted by the falling oil price. Mining shares are also giving some support after the better than expected data from China, a key consumer of commodities. Falling markets do not appear to be stopping the flow of major deals, especially if they involve tax benefits. US healthcare group Steris has agreed to buy the UK\u2019s Synergy Health, a specialist in sterilisation services, for \u00a319.50 a share or around $1.9bn. In the market Synergy\u2019s shares have jumped 32% to \u00a318.50. The merged company will be incorporated in the UK, presumably so it can benefit from lower corporate taxes. The US is trying to clamp down on such moves, which have been cited as important reasons for a number of proposed deals, notable Pfizer\u2019s attempt to buy AstraZeneca. Over in Russia, and the ruble continued to weaken against the dollar and euro, despite central bank intervention. The currency touched a new all-time low against the euro, as it continues to be pressurised by falling oil prices, the strength of the dollar and the impact of sanction on Russia due to the Ukraine situation. Russia\u2019s central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said it had spent $6bn defending the ruble in the past 10 days but maintained the situation on the currency market was under control. Alastair Winter at Daniel Stewart said: Russia\u2019s central bank is rapidly using up its reserves in its fight to slow the rouble\u2019s plunge. Mr Putin may have won the first easy battles but by putting politics before economics he is risking a deep recession. The slide in the price of oil is inflicting the worst damage.The news that he is removing troops from the Ukraine border may be posturing but could also be a sign that in the rumoured splits at Mr Putin\u2019s \u2018imperial court\u2019 the realists are starting to prevail. European stock markets are clawing back some of their early losses, but they\u2019re all still in the red (the DAX is down 0.3% and the CAC is down 0.4%). Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, says it could be a long week: Just over a month ago expectations that the FTSE could break above the 7,000 level were the norm, with the index trading less than 100 points away. The subsequent economic data out of Germany and dismantling of confidence has not only slaughtered European markets but dragged the UK down too. Only an hour or so into Monday\u2019s trading and this already feels like it will be a long week: ratings agencies are downgrading their outlook on France, Tuesday\u2019s German ZEW data is thought unlikely to inspire, the European Council is likely to reject the latest French budget, and Thursday\u2019s eurozone inflation figures are a real cause for concern. Here\u2019s the biggest risers and fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning: Today\u2019s stock market falls come as investors await a showdown between the European Central Bank, markets and politicians within Europe. Jeremy Cook of World First sums up the rival camps: The first, led by ECB President Mario Draghi, is those who are looking for a more accommodative monetary policy from the European Central Bank to further support business and lending within the Eurozone. The second are those members of the European Central Bank who are against these unconventional measures, led by Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann. Thirdly are the Eurozone politicians who may be eventually called upon to change the rules of the Eurozone in order to allow the European Central Bank more room to manoeuvre. Another reason for gloom this morning; Britain\u2019s public finances watchdog has warned that income tax revenues are likely to come in lower than expected. And that\u2019s because many of the jobs created since the recession ended are relatively poorly paid. Press Association has the details: Robert Chote, the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said the expected shortfall was due to the numbers going into relatively low paid work. \u201cFrom the perspective of the public finances, that\u2019s not particularly good news,\u201d he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \u201cThe Chancellor of the Exchequer gets more bang for his buck if wages and salaries rise as a result of people\u2019s earnings going up than if employment goes up. \u201cIf earnings go up you are taking more people into higher income tax brackets whereas if employment is going up you are perhaps bringing in more people at the bottom. \u201cThis continued story of earnings growing less rapidly than expected and employment growing more rapidly than expected does perhaps suggest that we\u2019re more likely to be disappointed than to over-achieve on income tax receipts this year.\u201d While shares fall, the gold price is rising - up $8 per ounce to $1,230 this morning. Gold is benefitting from the market nervousness. It is also higher because the US dollar (in which it is priced) has fallen back after a recent rally. It\u2019s another \u2018sea of red\u2019 across Europe\u2019s stock markets this morning, as the German DAX hit a new one-year low: The FTSE 100 has hit its lowest level since July 2013, at the start of trading in London. The blue-chip index of top shares fell by as much as 43 points to 6294, a 15-month low. The biggest faller is chipmaker ARM; the semiconductor industry is under pressure after a profit warning from US firm Microchip. Other European stock markets also opened in the red, with the German DAX and French CAC both down 1%. Fears that Germany may fall into recession, and the news that rating agency S&amp;P cut France\u2019s credit rating outlook on Friday night, are weighing on the markets. The mood on the trading floors is rather bearish, as IG analyst Chris Weston puts it: The [market] open is at least looking like a lonely and dark place for the bulls. It\u2019s not a rout, though -- mining shares have picked up in early trading in London, saving the FTSE 100 from falling further. Middle East stock markets have already started the week badly, having opened on Sunday. The Dubai market tumbled 6.5%, as falling oil prices and growth fears sparked a wave of selling among traders, who were also reacting to Friday\u2019s big losses in Europe and the US. Asian markets fell today despite better than expected Chinese trade data over the weekend. Associated Press has more details: Asian stock markets were lower Monday, shrugging off robust Chinese trade figures as investors exited riskier assets after concerns resurfaced about the global economic outlook. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell 0.6 percent to 22,962.35 and China\u2019s Shanghai Composite slid 1 percent to 2,351.39. South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropped 0.8 percent to 1,926.18. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 declined 0.6 percent to 5,159.00. Markets in Southeast Asia and New Zealand also dropped. Stock markets in Japan were closed for a holiday. Last week, the International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts for this year and next, citing weakness in Japan, Latin America and Europe. The global economy will expand 3.3 percent this year instead of 3.4 percent and expand 3.8 percent in 2015. The IMF said recovery is \u201cweak and uneven\u201d in the advanced economies. Terry Torrison, managing director at Monaco-based McLaren Securities, tells Reuters that traders are rather nervous after last week\u2019s selloff: \u201cWe\u2019re still looking quite poorly, on the markets. The nervousness is still there. I don\u2019t think anyone will want to come running back into the market early doors,\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are beginning the new week where they ended the old one -- falling, in the face of economic worries. The Asian markets have lost ground already today, sending leading shares across the region down to seven-month lows. Japan is closed for a public holiday. And European markets are expected to follow suit when trading begins at 8am BST. Both the FTSE 100 and German DAX hit their lowest levels of the year last week, and are expected to continue that trend. William Nicholls of Capital Spreads in London writes: \u201cEuropean equities look set to open sharply lower yet again following a terrible ending to U.S. equity trading on Friday and another lurch lower in Asia overnight,\u201d \u201cAs the global recovery seems to become increasingly less certain...the risk off trade has become worryingly prevalent.\u201d Last week ended badly for Europe, with the FTSE 100 and German DAX both hitting their lowest level in a year, after a flurry of bad economic data from Germany Then, after the markets closed, there was a double-whammy of bad news from rating agency S&amp;P. It cut its outlook on France, and stripped Finland of its AAA rating altogether. Finns Told Golden Era Over After S&amp;P Downgrade Shock The market correction comes as several of the world\u2019s top central bankers and finance ministers gather in New York to \u2018war game\u2019 the collapse of a major transatlantic bank. Fed chair Janet Yellen, Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Treasury secretary Jack Lew and chancellor George Osborne will play out a financial crisis, to see if they cope better than in 2008. Six years after Lehman\u2019s crash, US and UK play out next financial crisis. And the other big news of the day is the award of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, around lunchtime....",

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are a number of ways in which the deep-rooted problems in the euro-zone could play out. The single currency could muddle through, as it has for many years. But our feeling is that more extreme outcomes are still on the cards, including an eventual break-up. In any event, it is hard to see any solution that does not involve additional easing by the ECB and further euro weakness in the coming months.</p> <p>We are less worried about the second concern, namely the collapse in the oil price. This slump is partly a reflection of weak demand from Europe and China, but it is mainly due to booming supply and has been compounded by dollar strength and panic selling. As such, the collapse in oil prices overstates the weakness of world economy. And whatever the reasons for the fall, lower energy costs should actually help to kick-start global growth. Overall, we expect the price of Brent to recover a little by year-end, perhaps to $93 per barrel from the current $88, before heading lower once more (our end-2015 and end-2016 forecasts are $85 and $80, respectively).</p> <p>The third global concern is the slowdown in the major emerging economies. But this is essentially old news. The bulk of this slowdown took place between 2010 and 2012, since when growth has actually been relatively stable. Admittedly, China\u2019s growth may have weakened a little further in the third quarter\u2013 perhaps to sub-7%. But this would still be a decent and probably healthier pace. </p> <p>Overall, our view is that a lot of the bad news for commodity prices \u2013 especially metals \u2013 is now surely priced in. </p> <p>The final source of concern is a host of worries under the general umbrella of \u201cgeo-political risks\u201d, to which we must now add fears over the Ebola outbreak. We think the bulk of these worries are overdone, but again it could be Europe that provides the biggest shocks. Political developments in the UK and France are worth watching especially closely. In particular, the rise of UKIP could force an early referendum on the UK\u2019s membership of the EU, with any talk of British exit sending shockwaves across the region.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, even if we are right that global growth fears soon start to fade \u2013 helped if necessary by additional stimulus in the euro-zone and China \u2013 the focus could simply return to the prospects of an earlier tightening of monetary policy in the US. This should see Treasury yields resume their upward trend and keep market volatility generally high. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-543bd75be4b052dd998f78b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-10-13T13:49:49.201Z\">2.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Following the latest surveillance visit to Spain by European Commission staff, the EC and ECB <a href=\"http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2014/html/pr141013_1.en.html\">concluded</a> the situation was improving but further reforms were needed</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The recent economic and financial developments confirm the positive trends of stabilisation that have been unfolding over the last two years.

The euro area and German economies have slowed, but are not in recession. Industrial production data should reverse their falls in the autumn.</p> <p>But, still, something has happened, even if recent data are an exaggeration. Reliable indicators do point to a slowdown in German manufacturing, in part driven by its hitherto successful capital goods sector. We\u2019d attribute that to slower demand growth in Asia and a knock to exporters\u2019 confidence from the imposition of sanctions on Russia.</p> <p> We think this marks an important shift. Germany is perhaps the world\u2019s most imbalanced economy: biased towards exports and with a current account surplus worth 7% of GDP. Those imbalances have until now driven significant economic (out)performance. But external demand has turned less supportive. That points to a gradual erosion of Germany\u2019s trade and current account surplus and, in turn, a headwind against German GDP growth from net trade.</p> <p>The key question is what that means for growth, in both Germany and the euro area. In the short term, slower German growth is likely to keep euro area GDP growth anaemic, given how insipid the recovery is in the rest of the euro area. So far, negative feedback from weaker external to domestic demand in Germany and the rest of the euro area looks limited. Although some further deterioration is likely, it may be offset other factors pushing for an improvement in euro area domestic demand dynamics.</p> <p>Still, insipid GDP growth and diminishing external demand require stronger domestic stimulus. The political will for, let alone implementation of, looser fiscal policy is still absent. That leaves monetary policy: we continue to expect the ECB to broaden its asset purchases to sovereign debt, possibly early next year.</p> <p>Another mechanism to offset this would be a weaker currency. The recent drop in the euro can help, but a larger decline would be necessary to deliver a meaningful change to the euro area\u2019s growth dynamics. As it happens, such a fall would likely benefit the export sector in other euro area economies rather than Germany. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58659ba588531e2fce7e706d62dd21a174eab8c7\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/13/1413200468073/f7ffbd50-466d-4459-96e5-0be6c27736b1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cars for export at the harbour of the German northern town of Bremerhaven.

Only a small minority of institutions are likely to have a headline capital shortfall that means they will need to establish plans to raise capital or reduce assets by the middle of 2015. </p> </blockquote> <p>But the assessments, due to be published on 26 October, are not the end of it, and Fitch estimated it would cost another \u20ac235bn to raise reserves enough to cover impaired loans for all banks to around 80%. It said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The ECB\u2019s comprehensive assessment is only a first step in levelling the playing field for banks\u2019 access to private sector funds and ability to extend lending. High levels of unreserved problem loans will leave some banks, particularly in weaker countries, still vulnerable, Fitch Ratings says. </p> <p>There is a strong correlation between banks with the weakest balance sheets and weak eurozone sovereigns. Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain made up more than two thirds of unreserved impaired loans at end of the first half of 2014. The banks with the highest unreserved impaired loans relative to capital tend to be from peripheral eurozone countries.<br></p> <p>Capitalisation has strengthened notably for most of the 130 banks undergoing the assessment since the last EU-wide stress test in 2011. This has continued into 2014, with reported equity for the banks in the exercise rising by around \u20ac65bn in the first half of 2014, including common equity raising of around \u20ac31bn. The banks also issued \u20ac15bn of additional Tier 1 securities, with further progress in the third quarter of 2014.<br></p> <p>We expect further capital increases and restructuring to follow the comprehensive assessment at the banks identified as the weakest. Despite this, balance sheet strength will remain dependent on collateral valuation. Further progress will be needed in the first few years of the single supervisory mechanism to strengthen the balance sheet of weaker banks.<br></p> <p>We estimate it would cost around \u20ac70bn to raise reserve coverage of impaired loans for all banks undergoing the assessment to 60%. Upping coverage to a very solid (and arguably conservative) level of 80% would cost around \u20ac235bn.

      "bodyText": "Apple and other multinationals based in Ireland are to be given a four-year window before the phasing out of a scheme that cuts their tax bills. Amid mounting international criticism of the arrangements, which save foreign companies billions of euros, Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, is expected to announce the end of the \u201cdouble Irish\u201d scheme when he delivers his budget on Tuesday. The European commission is investigating \u201csweetheart\u201d tax deals between the Irish state and Apple, and last month Brussels provisionally found that the iPhone maker\u2019s tax arrangements in Ireland were so generous as to amount to state aid. Noonan\u2019s move may pre-empt measures hinted at by the UK chancellor last month, when he announced a crackdown on technology firms\u2019 tax strategies at the Conservative party conference. George Osborne said: \u201cSome of the biggest technology companies in the world \u2026 go to extraordinary lengths to pay little or no tax here \u2026 We will put a stop to it.\u201d Party officials briefed that he had companies using the double Irish scheme in his sights. On the international stage, the G20 group of powerful economies has commissioned the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to produce a package of tax reforms to rein in multinationals. This work is expected to be completed by summer 2015. Accompanying a pledge to remove the tax loophole, Noonan\u2019s budget is expected to contain incentives for multinationals, such as lower tax rates for companies that centre their research and development facilities on Ireland. The so-called \u201cpatent box\u201d will reward foreign firms that base their technological developments in the Irish state. This echoes the UK\u2019s regime, which has attracted criticism from other countries as well as the EU\u2019s code of conduct committee. One of the republic\u2019s largest unions, Unite, which has more than 100,000 members in Ireland, said the phasing out of the double Irish scheme was the result of EU pressure on the government. Michael Taft, an economist at Unite, said: \u201cWhat corporations like Apple will lose when they get rid of the double Irish they will make up for in terms of other tax schemes for things like research and development.\u201d Tasc, the Dublin-based, centre-left economic thinktank, has warned that global publicity over the double Irish and other similar tax schemes has caused severe \u201creputational damage\u201d for Ireland. Nat O\u2019Connor, Tasc\u2019s research director, said: \u201cThe negative international view of Ireland\u2019s excessive flexibility around corporation tax has probably worsened the country\u2019s reputation. Instead, Ireland needs to highlight the many other reasons why investment here is attractive, including our English-speaking, well-educated young workforce. Ireland also needs to rebalance the economy in favour of indigenous companies and reduce reliance on foreign direct investment.\u201d The double Irish loophole allows US companies to reduce their tax bill far below Ireland\u2019s 12.5% corporate tax rate by shifting most of their taxable income from an operating company in Ireland to another Irish-registered firm in an offshore tax haven such as Bermuda. While the phasing out of the double Irish will be the main item of the budget watched by the republic\u2019s EU and international partners, Noonan\u2019s plans for the state\u2019s finances will also be critical, both in terms of Ireland\u2019s fragile recovery but also the fate of the Fine Gael-Labour coalition. Tens of thousands of people marched through central Dublin on Saturday in a protest against newly proposed water charges. To counter rising anger, Noonan will put forward a proposal to allow households to claim tax refunds worth up to \u20ac100 (about \u00a380) from their water bills. There is also expected to be a 1% cut in the top rate of income tax, which stands at 41%. There will also be reductions to the universal social charge, which was introduced in 2011 to bring in extra revenue to run public services.",

We believe Randgold remains the best managed and highest quality gold stock in our European coverage universe and we continue to think it deserves to trade at a premium to its gold peers. After share price weakness, valuation metrics look less expensive; we believe Randgold offers high quality/low cost exposure to gold price upside, medium-term dividend growth and long-term value accretive growth potential from their exploration portfolio. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 26.27 points higher at 6366.24 but it came off its best levels after another opening decline on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down nearly 30 points by the time London closed. With worries about global growth, the oil price continued to slide, with Brent crude down another 2% to $88.2 a barrel, at one point reaching its lowest level for almost four years. Key producers Saudi Arabia and Kuwait added to the decline by suggesting Opec was unlikely to cut production to boost prices. Elsewhere chip designers continued to suffer from last week\u2019s warning from US group Microchip Technology. Arm dropped 20.5p to 822p while CSR, in talks about a takeover by Microchip, fell 26p to 645p. But United Utilities added 16.5p to 808p after Morgan Stanley lifted its target price from 865p to 875p. Lower down the market, 7digital jumped 77% to 35.875p after it confirmed reports it was in talks with Black Eyed Peas musician and The Voice judge Will.i.am about launching a music service for a new range of devices, including watches.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A French economist who has been working since the 1980s on ways to curb the dominance of major companies has won the Nobel prize for economics. Praising Jean Tirole\u2019s attempts to \u201ctame powerful firms\u201d, the committee awarding the 8m kronor (\u00a3750,000) prize said the University of Toulouse professor was \u201cone of the most influential economists of our time\u201d. The committee chose an area of economics that has become increasingly important as governments have privatised former public monopolies such as water, electricity and telecoms and Tirole\u2019s work has been adopted by competition regulators around the world. Tirole, 61, has covered a wide range of areas including pay, the banking industry and credit card fees. In a paper last year he scrutinised, with Roland B\u00e9nabou, a \u201cbonus culture that takes over the workplace, generating distorted decisions and significant efficiency losses, particularly in the long run\u201d. He is known for his collaboration with the late Jean-Jacques Laffont. After winning the award, Tirole described Laffont, who died 10 years ago, as \u201cmy mentor and dear friend\u201d and said his former colleague \u201cprobably would have deserved to be with me today in this prize for regulation and competition policy\u201d. The judges said: \u201c[Tirole] has made important theoretical research contributions in a number of areas, but most of all he has clarified how to understand and regulate industries with a few powerful firms.\u201d The panel said Tirole had shown the \u201cdeep and essential differences\u201d between regulating companies in different sectors, such as telecoms companies or banks. Imposing caps on prices could reduce the influence of monopolies in some sectors, but not in others, the judges said, pointing to Tirole\u2019s use of game theory and contract theory to develop competition analysis. Announcing the winner, Staffan Normark, permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s prize in economic sciences is about taming powerful firms\u201d. Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the EU commissioner in charge of competition policy, said Tirole\u2019s work \u201chas been central to the economic analysis underpinning many of our instruments in competition policy and beyond\u201d. The economics award is technically in the name of the Swedish central bank in the memory of Alfred Nobel, as the field was not stipulated as one of the five areas for awards by the Swedish inventor of dynamite, who set up the Nobel prizes in his will. After receiving the award, Tirole took questions on topics including Google and the banking sector, welcoming attempts to create a banking union in the eurozone but acknowledging banking was hard to regulate. He said: \u201cBanking is a very hard thing to regulate and we economists, academics, have to do more work on this.\u201d Tirole said he felt proud but added: \u201cIt\u2019s also being with the right people, in the right place, at the right moment. And, you know, it\u2019s team work too.\u201d He told his 90-year-old mother, who used to teach French, Latin and Greek, to sit down before telling her the news. Economists said his selection was not controversial. \u201cMost people thought he\u2019d get it at some point,\u201d said Mark Armstrong, professor at All Souls College, Oxford. Armstrong described Tirole as \u201ca theorist, but someone who\u2019s very much interested in real-world problems\u201d. Referring to Tirole\u2019s work with Laffont, Armstrong said: \u201cWhile much regulation of monopolies used simple schemes such as rate of return regulation and price cap regulation, their contribution was to show how to move beyond these to forms of regulation which were more sensitive to the details of the market, including the scope to introduce competition into monopoly markets.\u201d Oxford University economics professor Paul Klemperer told Reuters: \u201cHe has been the dominant figure in industrial organisation. It was not a question of whether but when he would be awarded the prize. \u201cIt has given us understanding of how to think about regulating firms, that there is not one size fits all.\u201d However, David Blanchflower of Dartmouth Colleague in the US tweeted \u201cabout time the Nobel (economics) committee started to award prizes to people who discover empirical facts about how the world works\u201d. Tirole is the second Frenchman to win a Nobel prize this year \u2013 Patrick Modiano won the literature award \u2013 which prompted Manuel Valls, the French prime minister, to tweet: \u201cAfter Patrick Modiano, another Frenchman in the stars: congratulations to Jean Tirole. It makes a mockery of French-bashing\u201d. It is 25 years since a French economist last received the award, which was first handed out in 1969. It has been won by 74 individuals, some of whom have become familiar names, such as Joseph Stiglitz \u2013 with whom Tirole has worked in the past \u2013 James Tobin and Milton Friedman. Only one woman has ever won, Elinor Ostrom, in 2009. The last French economist to win was Maurice Allais. Last year, the prize went to three economists, Eugene Fama, Lars Hansen and Robert Shiller for their work on predictions in financial markets.",

      "body": "<p>A French economist who has been working since the 1980s on ways to curb the dominance of major companies has won the Nobel prize for economics.</p> <p>Praising Jean Tirole\u2019s attempts to \u201ctame powerful firms\u201d, the committee awarding the 8m kronor (\u00a3750,000) prize said the University of Toulouse professor was \u201cone of the most influential economists of our time\u201d. The committee chose an area of economics that has become increasingly important as governments have privatised former public monopolies such as water, electricity and telecoms and Tirole\u2019s work has been adopted by competition regulators around the world.</p> <p>Tirole, 61, has covered a wide range of areas including pay, the banking industry and credit card fees. <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~rbenabou/papers/Multitasking%20March%2019%20paper.pdf\" title=\"\">In a paper last year</a> he scrutinised, with Roland B\u00e9nabou, a \u201cbonus culture that takes over the workplace, generating distorted decisions and significant efficiency losses, particularly in the long run\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/statuses/521617023181553664\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>BREAKING NEWS: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/nobelprize2014?src=hash\">#nobelprize2014</a> in Economic Sciences to French Jean Tirole <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UT1Capitole\">@UT1Capitole</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/nIPAU05eTo\">pic.twitter.com/nIPAU05eTo</a></p>&mdash; The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/521617023181553664\">October 13, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>He is known for his collaboration with the late Jean-Jacques Laffont. After winning the award, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2014/tirole-interview.html\" title=\"\">Tirole described Laffont</a>, who died 10 years ago, as \u201cmy mentor and dear friend\u201d and said his former colleague \u201cprobably would have deserved to be with me today in this prize for regulation and competition policy\u201d.</p> <p>The judges said: \u201c[Tirole] has made important theoretical research contributions in a number of areas, but most of all he has clarified how to understand and regulate industries with a few powerful firms.\u201d The panel said Tirole had shown the \u201cdeep and essential differences\u201d between regulating companies in different sectors, such as telecoms companies or banks. Imposing caps on prices could reduce the influence of monopolies in some sectors, but not in others, the judges said, pointing to Tirole\u2019s use of game theory and contract theory to develop competition analysis.</p> <p>Announcing the winner, Staffan Normark, permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s prize in economic sciences is about taming powerful firms\u201d.</p> <p>Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the EU commissioner in charge of competition policy, said Tirole\u2019s work \u201chas been central to the economic analysis underpinning many of our instruments in competition policy and beyond\u201d. The economics award is technically in the name of the Swedish central bank in the memory of Alfred Nobel, as the field was not stipulated as one of the five areas for awards by the Swedish inventor of dynamite, who set up the Nobel prizes in his will.</p> <p>After receiving the award, Tirole took questions on topics including Google and the banking sector, welcoming attempts to create a banking union in the eurozone but acknowledging banking was hard to regulate. He said: \u201cBanking is a very hard thing to regulate and we economists, academics, have to do more work on this.\u201d</p> <p>Tirole said he felt proud but added: \u201cIt\u2019s also being with the right people, in the right place, at the right moment. And, you know, it\u2019s team work too.\u201d He told his 90-year-old mother, who used to teach French, Latin and Greek, to sit down before telling her the news.</p> <p>Economists said his selection was not controversial. \u201cMost people thought he\u2019d get it at some point,\u201d said Mark Armstrong, professor at All Souls College, Oxford. Armstrong described Tirole as \u201ca theorist, but someone who\u2019s very much interested in real-world problems\u201d.</p> <p>Referring to Tirole\u2019s work with Laffont, Armstrong said: \u201cWhile much regulation of monopolies used simple schemes such as rate of return regulation and price cap regulation, their contribution was to show how to move beyond these to forms of regulation which were more sensitive to the details of the market, including the scope to introduce competition into monopoly markets.\u201d</p> <p>Oxford University economics professor Paul Klemperer told Reuters: \u201cHe has been the dominant figure in industrial organisation. It was not a question of whether but when he would be awarded the prize. \u201cIt has given us understanding of how to think about regulating firms, that there is not one size fits all.\u201d</p> <p>However, David Blanchflower of Dartmouth Colleague in the US tweeted \u201cabout time the Nobel (economics) committee started to award prizes to people who discover empirical facts about how the world works\u201d.</p> <p>Tirole is the second Frenchman to win a Nobel prize this year \u2013 Patrick Modiano won the literature award \u2013 which prompted Manuel Valls, the French prime minister, to tweet: \u201cAfter Patrick Modiano, another Frenchman in the stars: congratulations to Jean Tirole. It makes a mockery of French-bashing\u201d.</p> <p>It is 25 years since a French economist last received the award, which was first handed out in 1969. It has been won by 74 individuals, some of whom have become familiar names, such as Joseph Stiglitz \u2013 with whom Tirole has worked in the past \u2013 James Tobin and Milton Friedman.</p> <p>Only one woman has ever won, Elinor Ostrom, in 2009. The last French economist to win was Maurice Allais.</p> <p>Last year, the prize went to three economists,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/14/american-nobel-prize-economics-fama-hansen-shiller\" title=\"\"> Eugene Fama, Lars Hansen and Robert Shiller for their work on predictions</a> in financial markets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/statuses/521617243516710912\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>61 years old, French Jean Tirole <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UT1Capitole\">@UT1Capitole</a>, 1/1 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/nobelprize2014?src=hash\">#nobelprize2014</a> in Economic Sciences <a href=\"http://t.co/W7tQ002ngW\">pic.twitter.com/W7tQ002ngW</a></p>&mdash; The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/521617243516710912\">October 13, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>",

    "webTitle": "UK government to sell Eurostar stake before general election", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne is to announce on Monday that the government is selling its 40% stake in Eurostar before the election. The chancellor will say he is looking for bids by the end of the month and is hopeful the privatisation of the Channel tunnel train operator will raise up to \u00a3300m. Britain has part-owned Eurostar for the past 20 years, but according to Osborne the sale is part of the Treasury\u2019s plan to reduce the national debt by offloading state assets. He will say: \u201cI am determined that we go on making the decisions to reform the British economy and tackle our debts. So we will proceed with the potential sale of the UK\u2019s shareholding in Eurostar today. \u201cEnsuring we can deliver the best quality infrastructure for Britain and the best value for money for the taxpayer are key parts of our long-term economic plan. \u201cAs part of our aim to achieve \u00a320bn from asset sales by 2020, the sale proceeds would make an important contribution to the task of reducing the public sector debt.\u201d This year Osborne has been busy selling the government\u2019s large minority stake in Lloyds bank to claw back some of the losses dating back to its rescue in 2008, though he has abandoned plans for an open public sale before the election, preferring piecemeal offers to private City institutions. He will be hoping to avoid a repetition of the Royal Mail debacle, when the government came under heavy fire for selling a large stake for a fraction of its later value, handing huge profits to institutions involved in the sale. The French state-owned railway company, SNCF, owns 55% of Eurostar, while the state-owned Belgian company, SNCB, owns the remaining 5%. SNCF has indicated that it is not interested in buying Britain\u2019s stake but has a \u201clast look\u201d right that would allow it to come in at the end of the bidding process and pick up the holding at a 15% premium. Pension companies, investment funds and infrastructure funds are seen as the likeliest bidders, with the UK government hopeful that the sale will be completed in the first quarter of 2015. The proposed sell-off comes at a time of debate about private versus public ownership of Britain\u2019s railways amid concern about fare prices and quality of services. Unions voiced strong opposition to the idea of the Eurostar sell-off when it was first floated in the 2013 autumn statement. Eurostar, which links St Pancras International in London with destinations in France and Belgium, has been enjoying record passenger numbers and has ordered a fleet of new high-speed trains, which will be able to reach speeds of up to 199mph (320km/h). As Britain\u2019s first custom-built high-speed rail line, it has carried more than 145 million passengers since its services through the Channel tunnel began in 1994. The success of Eurostar has encouraged the government to build a second high-speed line linking London with cities in the Midlands and the north. Originally a partnership between SNCF, SNCB and British Rail, Eurostar became a single, unified corporate entity in 2010. Britain\u2019s stake, held by London and Continental Railways after BR\u2019s privatisation, passed to the Treasury this year. The company made a profit of \u00a318.6m in 2013, of which the Treasury received \u00a37.4m. That was up on the \u00a36.5m from profits of \u00a316.3m in 2012. Osborne is being advised on the sale by the Swiss bank UBS, but is reserving the right not to go ahead if the bids are not high enough. The Treasury said it wanted to ensure that the taxpayer got value for money from the deal and expects there to be several rounds of bidding before an eventual purchaser for the stake emerges. The sale will lead to a small reduction in Britain\u2019s \u00a31.4tn national debt but will not affect the government\u2019s preferred measure of the budget deficit, public sector net borrowing. Other state-owned assets being lined up for sale include the legacy Royal Mail pension assets, the uranium enrichment company Urenco, the income-contingent student loan book and further public sector wireless communication spectrum.",

In these terms the richest quintile are only 0.4% worse off on average. The poorest quintile of households will suffer a 1.4% decline in disposable income compared with what they would have had prior to the May budget: The Natsem modelling also refutes the common refrain among members of the government that while the budget was harsh, removing the carbon price balanced out the impact. For example, in Question Time in August the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, asked Hockey \u201chow is it strongly arguable that pensioners are going to be better off under this budget?\u201d to which he replied, \u201cthe starting point is that the Coalition has abolished the carbon tax\u201d. However the Natsem modelling shows that while the removal of the carbon price does reduce the average impact of the budget measures, it does not completely cancel out the negative impact.
