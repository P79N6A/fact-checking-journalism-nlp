      "bodyText": "Tesco has revealed that new chief executive Dave Lewis received a golden hello worth more than \u00a34m when he agreed to join the crisis-hit supermarket giant. The cash-and-shares payment was worth \u00a34.3m when it was made at the start of September and comes on top of a pay deal that includes a \u00a31.25m salary and membership of two executive bonus schemes that could trigger multimillion-pound payments in the future. Tesco told the stock exchange it had given Lewis 1.66m shares to compensate for awards surrendered when he quit his previous job at Unilever. The shares, which can be cashed in over the next three years, were part of an arrangement that included a \u00a3525,000 payment in lieu of the cash bonus he would have received from Unilever this year. However, Lewis is already sitting on a paper loss because the options were worth \u00a33.8m at last month\u2019s share price but the stock has plummeted in the wake of the recent accounting scandal, being valued at just \u00a32.8m today. Tesco\u2019s new finance director, Alan Stewart \u2013 who joined from Marks &amp; Spencer at the end of September \u2013 also banked 880,000 shares, worth \u00a31.7m at the time, as compensation for awards forfeited when he left the retailer. Some institutional shareholders frown upon new directors being paid out of previous schemes as it defeats a key goal of those schemes, which is to retain talent. Both executives, who were rushed in earlier than scheduled to turn around the embattled group, could yet be handed additional options to reflect dividends attached to the sacrificed shares. Stewart will also receive a further award in June next year to compensate him for a forfeited M&amp;S bonus. Lewis and Stewart are tasked with a major strategic overhaul of the group, which last week reported that pre-tax profits crashed 92% to \u00a3112m on the back of more than \u00a3500m of one-off charges in the first six months of this year. The retailer confirmed a \u00a3263m hole in its profits relating to the misbooking of supplier payments, a matter now being investigated by City regulators. The details of Lewis\u2019s golden hello were not published to the stock exchange when his appointment was announced on 21 July because at the time he had been unable to provide Tesco with the required details \u2013 notably the performance conditions \u2013 relating to his two Unilever share bonus schemes. The lack of information, revealed in a letter outlining the terms of the job offer and seen by the Guardian along with Lewis\u2019s contract, meant the company was \u201cunable to calculate the forfeiture values\u201d. The letter also stated that Lewis is eligible to participate in two executive bonus schemes, although in a weekend interview he said they were being reviewed. \u201cOne of the things that the chairman and remuneration committee are doing, and have asked me to look at, is reviewing what the long-term plan and the long-term incentives should be,\u201d he told the interviewer. Previous executives had been awarded bonuses based on a range of performance targets including earnings per share and return on capital. The maximum payouts from the existing short- and long-term bonus schemes are 250% and 275% of base salary respectively, although the company\u2019s dire financial performance meant the former chief executive, Philip Clarke, did not collect a bonus during his three-year tenure. In this year\u2019s annual report Tesco announced its pay policy was under review and it would be consulting with shareholders on the matter. \u201cThe world of retail is evolving rapidly \u2026 and Tesco is changing to make the most of the opportunities this presents,\u201d wrote Stuart Chambers, chair of the renumeration committee. \u201cTo ensure we continue to operate a remuneration framework which is fully aligned with our strategy and provides competitive rewards to management for the creation of shareholder value, the committee plans to undertake a review.\u201d The revised plan will be put to shareholders at next year\u2019s annual general meeting, he added. One Tesco investor said the retailer had not been in touch yet but was not suprised changes were being considered. \u201cTesco is going to have a different strategy over the next couple of years than would previously have been the case,\u201d he said. \u201cThe new chief executive has got one heck of a task and if part of that involves putting in place new incentives that shareholders feel happy with, then that is fair.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Markets hit by weak German business confidence -- business live", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Europe\u2019s stock markets have closed, and Italy\u2019s Milan index has endured a bad day. The Italian FTSE MIB tumbled 2.4%, as the failure of nine of its banks to pass the ECB\u2019s banking examination drove shares down. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: Italian stocks and particularly Italian banks were pasted after coming in bottom of the pile in the stress tests with Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena needing to raise 2.1bn euros to pass. Banca Monte dei Paschi can hardly be described as an Italian stallion, in fact if it were a horse after this many bailouts it would have been shot by now. In London the FTSE 100 index finished down around 0.4% David Madden of IG points to the concerns over Lloyds, which lost around 2% tonight: The British banks may have passed the European stress test but for traders the margin by which Lloyds passed was too close for comfort. It hardly instils confidence in the UK financial sector when the big five banks are given the all clear but the sector still finishes lower. The timing of the stress test could not be worse, with Lloyds and Standard Chartered issuing interim management statements tomorrow. Time for a catch-up.... Germany\u2019s economic outlook has darkened after business confidence slipped to its lowest level in 22 months, according to the IFO institute. IFO sees \u2018few bright spots\u2019 in the German economy now, as it suffers from geopolitical tensions and the weak European economy. Andreas Scheuerle, an economist at Dekabank, says that morale is now \u201cin a downward spiral\u201d in Germany, as geopolitics and the eurozone slowdown hits demand and confidence. The weak IFO report hit shares across Europe, with Germany\u2019s DAX down almost 1% this afternoon: Many of Europe\u2019s bank shares have rallied today, after yesterday\u2019s EU stress tests and asset quality reviews were published. However, Italy\u2019s Monte Dei Paschi has slumped by 20% after it failed the test, and must now find \u20ac2.1bn in new capital. Analysts believe the world\u2019s oldest bank could now be sold, or merged. Rival Carige Bank is down 13% this afternoon, after also failing the stress test. Stephen Lewis of ADM Investor Services fears that the euro stress tests will not suddenly revive the sector: Bank lending to the euro zone private sector is still on a falling trend, registering a 1.8% year-on-year rate of contraction in September. Loan repayments continue to exceed gross borrowing. In some sectors, the deleveraging process is probably, for the most part, autonomous; borrowers wish to scale down their operations in high-risk sectors such as real estate. In other instances, banks may well be pressing customers with large exposure to high-risk sectors to reduce their commitments and repay loans. In either case, the impact on sentiment of the ECB\u2019s stress test, even if favourable, is hardly likely to bring about a change in behaviour. The ECB\u2019s hope is that banks\u2019 new lending to more productive sectors of the economy, and especially to small and medium-sized businesses, will outweigh continued deleveraging elsewhere. But the chances of this happening are not helped by the sudden darkening in euro zone economic prospects. The ECB is likely to find that credit availability, though necessary for sustained economic expansion, is not a sufficient condition for triggering growth when other factors are unfavourable. In the UK, Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s shares are down 2%. Although it passed Europe\u2019s tests, there is speculation that it could struggle with the UK\u2019s own, tougher, examination due in December. That could hamper Lloyds\u2019 ability to start repaying dividends. In other news.... Italy\u2019s government has offered Brussels another \u20ac4.5bn of deficit cuts to address concerns over its 2015 budget, and warned that it can\u2019t risk a longer recession. Brazil\u2019s stock market is also sliding, currently down 4.6% as investors react to president Dilma Rousseff\u2019s re-election last night. And America\u2019s economy has lost some momentum this month, with service sector growth hitting its lowest rate in six months according to Markit. The European Central Bank has announced that it bought \u20ac1.7bn worth of covered bonds last week, as it began its new stimulus programme. Those purchases are meant to encourage bank lending and end the credit squeeze hampering the eurozone\u2019s recovery. Over in Cyprus, a former central bank governor was been jailed for five months for tax evasion today. Christodoulos Christodoulou had pleaded guilty to not declaring a \u20ac1m payment from Greek ship-owner Michalis Zolotas to a company managed by his daughter. Full details here. According to the Cyprus Mail, Christodoulou was transferred to Nicosia general hospital complaining of chest pain shortly after being sentenced by the Nicosia District Court. Another sign of slowdown. America\u2019s service sector is growing at its slowest rate in six months, according to a survey just released by data firm Markit. The US Services PMI dipped to 57.3 this month, from 58.9 in September. That\u2019s the weakest reading since April, but still shows expansion (any reading &gt;50 = growth). Markit says this signals \u201ca further moderation in overall activity growth from the post-crisis peak seen in June\u201d. New order growth slows, while and the business confidence reading was the weakest since July and one of the lowest readings seen over the past two years. It probably shows that the US growth rate will slow in the last three months of 2014. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit explains: \u201cThe flash PMI survey data show the pace of economic growth easing for a fourth consecutive month in October. The weakened growth of new orders and downturn in business optimism suggest that growth and hiring could slow further in coming months. \u201cHaving signalled an annualised rate of GDP growth of approximately 3.5% in the third quarter, the October readings indicate that the pace of economic growth looks set to moderate in the fourth quarter, down to perhaps 2.5% or less if the PMI falls further in coming months. \u201cThere are clearly many concerns, ranging from worries about the impact of Ebola, the Ukraine crisis, the ongoing plight of the Eurozone , signs of further weakness in emerging markets and the Fed starting to tighten policy. \u201cWe should not lose sight of the fact that the pace of growth nevertheless remains robust, having merely eased from very strong rates in prior months. The survey is also indicating another month of non-farm payroll growth in excess of 200,000 in October. This sustained strength should help alleviate recent worries about a sudden deterioration in the economy\u2019s health. The pace of expansion appears to be easing only moderately.\u201d One for the history buffs -- today is the 28th anniversary of Big Bang. That was the moment in 1986 when Mrs Thatcher deregulated the City of London, transforming it from a snoozy insiders\u2019 circle to the thrusting, go-getting institution that made Britain what she is today. Supporters would say that Big Bang helped London become Europe\u2019s financial powerhouse, transforming the UK economy. Critics say it paved the way for freewheeling financial capitalism, and the aggressive greed that helped to cause the 2008 financial crisis. Either way, it transformed the City. There\u2019s a nice piece in Moneyweek about the changes: Before 1986, the City worked rather differently to the way it does today. Old Etonians would roll in from the shires mid-morning, depart shortly after for a civilised lunch and a bottle of very nice Bordeaux at a discreet restaurant somewhere, then hop in a cab to the club for a few snifters of single malt, before being whisked back first-class to London\u2019s leafy fringes. If you wanted to buy a stock, you approached your broker, who placed the order with a \u2018jobber\u2019 \u2013 cockney barrow-boy types who made the trade on behalf of the public schoolboys. It was all terribly, terribly cosy. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t very competitive.... And in the Telegraph, economist Roger Bootle argues that Big Bang helped to create a world where financial institutions are \u201cnot only too big to fail, but too big to manage\u201d. The task of the financial authorities, not only here but elsewhere in the world, and especially in the United States, is to preserve the energy, competition and efficiency of today\u2019s financial system while clamping down on its conflicts of interest and its tendency to instability. I feel sure that this will eventually have to involve the barring of certain sorts of financial institutions from particular forms of financial activity. The Volcker Rule in the US and the Vickers reforms over here represent merely the starting point. Magnificent though it was, some of the Big Bang needs to be reversed. As predicted earlier, shares are tumbling on the Brazilian stock market as traders respond to Dilma Rousseff\u2019s re-election with a flurry of sell orders. The Bovespa stock index has slumped by 6% at the start of trading, with oil explorer Petrobras leading the selloff: And the Brazilian real continues to be thumped, as investors vent their angst that social democrat A\u00e9cio Neves - a more free-market friendly option to Rousseff -- had been narrowly defeated. Italy\u2019s government has made concessions to Brussels, after being challenged over its 2015 budget plans. Pier Carlo Padoan, minister of economy and finance, wrote to the EC today to outline \u20ac4.5bn in extra deficit-reduction measues. It includes \u20ac3.3bn that had been assigned to lower the tax burden on Italians. In the letter (online here), Padoan also reminds the EU of the economic strife in Italy, and emphasised the need for growth: At the same time, it is my duty to remind you that the Italian economy is going through one of the most severe and lengthy recessions in its history. GDP declined by more than 9% with respect to the level of 2008. The economy is now in its third year of recession and at serious risk of deflation - or a prolonged period of very low inflation - and stagnation. A fourth year of recession is to be avoided by all means as it would be extremely problematic to pull the country out of such an economie environment. Furthermore, it would make debt sustainability much harder to be maintained. That\u2019s why Italy had been trying to deliver a \u201cgrowth-friendly fiscal adjustment\u201d, Padoan explains. The 2015 budget includes more spending on various \u201cgrowth-enhancing spending\u201d such as R&amp;D, innovation, education and essential infrastructure projects. he points out. But still, it has agreed to these additional measures to hit Brussels\u2019 deficit demands. The ban on short-selling isn\u2019t helping Monte Dei Paschi\u2019s shares -- they\u2019re now down 20%! Brazil\u2019s Real has tumbled this morning, losing 3% against the US dollar following Dilma Rousseff\u2019s re-election as the country\u2019s president. It\u2019s going to be a rough day on the Brazilian stock market, where traders had hoped that her pro-business rival A\u00e9cio Neves would triumph. Shares in oil giant Petrobras have already tumbled 15%, in Frankfurt. TV reporter Stephanie Kennedy sums up the mood: Just in..... UK retailers have reported their fastest quarterly sales growth in three years, easing fears that the sector was struggling. The CBI found that clothing sales rose sharply this month. That suggesting that people have finally updated their wardrobes with wintery outfits after the long summer. Its October retail sales balance held steady at +31, beating forecasts of a fall to +25 (this measures how many shops reported that turnover had risen, or fallen) This pushed the three-month average retail sales balance to rise to +33 from +30, its highest level in three and a half years. The CBI reported that grocers and the clothing sector saw an acceleration in sales growth, but sales did fall at hardware &amp; DIY and specialist food &amp; drink shops. Rain Newton-Smith, Director of Economics at the CBI, explains: \u201cSales on our high streets are still ticking along and, with similar prospects next month, retail growth is looking more stable. \u201cThe clothing sector in particular appears to be bouncing back after the mild weather in September deterred people from buying their winter warmers. \u201cThe recent fall in inflation may help lift the spirits of households by making their budgets stretch further. But risks remain to the UK recovery more generally, with the Eurozone stalling, conflict in the Middle East and tensions over Ukraine. This could have an impact on consumer confidence and spending going forward. Oh dear, Monti Dei Paschi has just triggered another automatic suspension, as investors continue to sell heavily (via Milan trader @lemasabachthani) Today\u2019s slump in Monte Dei Paschi\u2019s shares is bad news for those traders who had driven its stock up last week. That optimism, ahead of the Bank stress tests/asset quality reviews, has now been punctured: Italy\u2019s stock market regulator has just banned investors from short-selling Monte Dei Paschi\u2019s shares today, or tomorrow, Reuters reports. That means traders cannot borrow stock in MDP to sell on the stock market, and then buy it back at a lower price to book a profit. Back in Italy, banking are still reeling from yesterday\u2019s stress tests and asset quality review. The financial sector is feeling singled out, after 9 of its lenders failed the examination. And this could fuel tensions between Italy and the rest of Europe. Carlo Alberto Carnevale-Maffe, professor of strategy at Italy\u2019s Bocconi University, has told CNBC that Italy has been held to a higher standard: There was a \u201csurgical targeting of Italian banks with asset quality review (AQR) drones . \u201cThe ECB targeted the banks with the lowest level of transparency and governance, and the highest links with the political system.\u201d Italy\u2019s stress test fail: Attack of the \u2018drones\u2019 Italy\u2019s two biggest lenders, Unicredit and Intesa Sanpaolo, both passed. But Monte Dei Paschi remains in the doldrums, having seen a sixth of its value wiped off this morning. Shares are trading after being suspended in a flurry of sell orders, and are down 17.5%. Fellow Italian bank Carige is also suffering; its shares are still down 15% after it was also failed (as covered earlier, it may now launch a big rights issue.) German confidence began sliding as the West began to hit Russia with economic sanctions over the Ukraine crisis, flags up market strategist David Scutt. This latest slide in German business confidence suggests that Europe\u2019s largest economy could be in for a bumpy ride in the fourth quarter, analysts say. Andreas Scheuerle, an economist at Dekabank, says that morale is now \u201cin a downward spiral\u201d (via Reuters). \u201cThe original mood killers - geopolitics, euro zone weakness, German economic policy and deflation concerns - have led to big downward revisions of forecasts and the weaker economic expectations are now weighing on sentiment.\u201d Germany grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, but then shrank by 0.2% between April and June. We find out next month whether it kept contracting in the third quarter - which would mean an official recession. Germany\u2019s economy has suffered another blow, with business confidence falling again to its lowest level in almost two years. The Munich-based IFO institute\u2019s survey of 7,000 firms showed the sixth consecutive fall in business sentiment. It found \u201calmost no bright spots\u201d in German industry at present, as Europe\u2019s largest economy teeters on the edge of recession. IFO\u2019s Business Climate index fell to 103.2, down from 104.7, which is the weakest level since December 2012. IFO found that firms are more gloomy about current conditions, and future prospects, than last month. It now fears that Germany\u2019s economy may not achieve any growth in the fourth quarter of this year. The relief rally has reached Greece: Monte dei Paschi di Siena can trace its origins back to 1472 -- 20 years before Columbus spied the New World on the horizon. The bank was set up as a \u201cmount of piety\u201d, but in recent years it has been dogged by regular losses and cash calls. Yesterday\u2019s bank test failure could now force MPS, which is Italy\u2019s third-largest bank by assets to be sold or merged. Thus the 15% tumble in its share price this morning. The WSJ has a good explanation of what went wrong: Analysts say the bank has been dogged by a series of strategic missteps\u2014in particular its 2007 purchase of Banca Antonveneta for \u20ac9 billion\u2014as well as interference by local politicians in Tuscany and shortsighted management by its majority shareholder, a Siena-based charitable foundation. In March 2009, the bank turned to the Italian government for a cash infusion of \u20ac1.9 billion. In 2013 it went back for an additional \u20ac2.2 billion. Since then, problems at the bank compelled the foundation to sell down its stake to about 2%; new management at the bank has overhauled its strategy and shed assets. Italian regulators say they would happily accept a sale or merger, if it put MPS on a more solid footing. Roberto Henriques, European credit analyst at JPMorgan, reckons the stress tests were rigorous enough: \u201cIt does meet the credibility test.\u201d Should we be relieved, or worried, that only 25 European banks failed yesterday\u2019s examination, with just 14 still needing extra capital? Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale reckons you can view it either way: Doctor Daghi gave the European banking system a reasonably clean bill of health, the ECB observing only that a smallish number of banks have to raise a modest amount of capital. It\u2019s either a reassuring or a naive picture of the banking system, depending on how you want to read it. Our equity analysts conclude that this is good news for bank stocks on the whole, while from a macro point of view it was largely a non-event that allows us to move on to bigger issues. Banking analyst Sandy Chen reckons Lloyds Banking Group could struggle to pass the UK\u2019s own, tougher, stress tests, which are due in December. That\u2019s explains why Lloyds isn\u2019t sharing in today\u2019s rally; its shares are still down 2.1% despite passing the European exam. Chen, of Cenkos Securities, explains that the stress tests from Britain\u2019s Prudential Regulatory Authority will be tougher, and could trip Lloyds up. A particular driver behind a weaker result would be a bigger modelled fall in UK house prices... e.g. 19% in the EBA stress scenario, versus the 34% potential fall in the house price index that was set out in the BOE\u2019s April 2014 stress test guidelines. And that could mean \u201c a difficult conversation with the regulators\u201d about when Lloyds, bailed out in 2008, can finally start paying dividends again Shares in a second Italian bank, Carige Bank, have also slumped this morning, down 17%. Carige, which is the largest bank in Liguria, is expected to raise at least \u20ac500m through a rights issue after European authorities found an \u20ac810m capital shortfall in its books. Austrian lender Raiffeisen\u2019s shares have also surged, by 7.3%, after passing the stress tests. Another sign of relief -- shares in Austrian bank Erste Group have jumped by 7.5%. Italy\u2019s Monte Dei Paschi\u2019s shares are being hammered in early trading in Milan after it became the most high-profile casualty of the bank tests. Trading in the world\u2019s oldest bank has just been temporarily suspended after they slumped by 15% in a rush of early selling. Investors aren\u2019t impressed to hear that Monte Dei Paschi needs an extra \u20ac2bn, just months after raising \u20ac5bn. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the tests are: raising the question of once again how much more money must be pumped into this bottomless pit of a bank that has had to raise extra capital each of the last three years. Most bank shares are rallying this morning, pushing the Eurostoxx Banking Index up by 1.7%. It tracks all the main banks across Europe, Shares in Germany\u2019s Commerzbank have surged by almost 9%, over in Frankfurt. It comfortably passed yesterday\u2019s stress test and asset quality review. Under the baseline scenario, Commerzbank had a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET 1) of 11.4%. The \u2018pass mark\u2019 was 8.0%. Clearly there was concern that problems could have been uncovered.... The FTSE 100 has rallied 50 points at the start of trading, up 0.79% at 6439. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says: sentiment is being buoyed by the European bank Stress test results. But Lloyds, which only just passed yesterday\u2019s stress test, are leading the fallers, down 2%. There is concern that Lloyds\u2019 may not be able to renew its dividends as soon as previously hoped. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s mild relief in Europe this morning after yesterday\u2019s stress tests of the regions banks showed up fewer problems than feared. Shares are expected to climb a little in Europe today, on relief that the tests didn\u2019t find deeper problems. Although 24 banks had capital shortfalls, 10 have raised funds since the tests were conducted. The remaining 14 banks must raise \u20ac25bn, as we reported yesterday: Twenty-four European banks fail financial stress tests Health check finds 24 EU banks ailing \u2013 but the UK\u2019s pass muster But there\u2019s gloom in Italy, though, where no fewer than nine lenders flunked the comprehensive review unveiled by the European Central Bank. That included the world\u2019s oldest bank, Monte dei Paschi, which must find \u20ac2.1bn fast. As my colleague Jill Treanor reported: The bank was one of nine Italian banks deemed to have failed the stress tests carried out by the European Banking Authority, which published its findings on Sunday and concluded 24 banks out of 123 it had tested across the European Union needed more capital. Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which is already in the midst of a restructuing exercise, said it had been penalised by the methodology used by the regulators and appointed UBS and Citigroup to advise it of its options and \u201cexplore all strategic alternatives for the bank\u201d. Italy\u2019s central bank has been griping about the tests already, saying its banks fell foul of a \u201cvery unfavourable\u201d methodology, including another protracted recession. But the results could intensify concern over Italy\u2019s economy. Also coming up today..... We get a new healthcheck on Germany\u2019s economy this morning, with the monthly IFO survey at 9am GMT. That will show whether business confidence has recovered from last month\u2019s tumble. And at 2.30pm GMT the European Central Bank will announce details of its Covered Bond Purchase programme, which began last week. Otherwise it\u2019s a bit quiet....",

Loan repayments continue to exceed gross borrowing. In some sectors, the deleveraging process is probably, for the most part, autonomous; borrowers wish to scale down their operations in high-risk sectors such as real estate. In other instances, banks may well be pressing customers with large exposure to high-risk sectors to reduce their commitments and repay loans. In either case, the impact on sentiment of the ECB\u2019s stress test, even if favourable, is hardly likely to bring about a change in behaviour. The ECB\u2019s hope is that banks\u2019 new lending to more productive sectors of the economy, and especially to small and medium-sized businesses, will outweigh continued deleveraging elsewhere. But the chances of this happening are not helped by the sudden darkening in euro zone economic prospects.

Green said: \u201cWe have been looking at this category as fashion-inspired fitness develops, and know that this is right in our customers\u2019 heartland. Creating a partnership with Beyonc\u00e9, one of the most hardworking and talented people in the world, who spends many hours of her life dancing, rehearsing and training is a unique opportunity to develop this category.\u201d The 50-50 joint venture between the retailer and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s management company Parkwood Entertainment, follows Topshop\u2019s revival of its partnership with Kate Moss earlier this year. The move reflects Topshop\u2019s growing business in the US where it has four flagship stores and a network of concessions in Nordstrom department stores. The Crazy in Love singer is already involved in the fashion industry via the House of Der\u00e9on brand she started with her mother. Last summer she collaborated with the H&amp;M fashion chain. She has also worked with the Tommy Hilfiger label on a range of fragrances. Beyonc\u00e9 said: \u201cI have always loved Topshop for their fashion credentials and forward thinking. Working with their development team to create and produce a technical and fashion led collection is exciting and I\u2019m looking forward to participating in all aspects of this partnership.\u201d Fashion collections are the latest accessories for pop stars. Rihanna fronted a range for UK clothing chain River Island last year, while Madonna and her daughter Lourdes\u2019 Material Girl brand sells at Macy\u2019s. Queen of them all, of course, is former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham, whose designer range launched in 2008 and has won her a string of awards, including being named recently as Britain\u2019s most successful entrepreneur of 2014.",

      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs has forecast that brent crude could drop in price to $80 a barrel next year as it slashed its oil price estimates due to a global supply glut. The investment bank said oil could fall to $80 a barrel in the second quarter of next year as production growth from countries outside the Opec countries outpaces demand. \u201cNon-Opec production has been delivering consistent record growth since May 2013, allowing the market to cope with an almost complete shutdown of production in Libya, sanctions on Iran, and slowing production growth in Iraq \u2026 A lower oil-price environment with increased volatility is likely to prove challenging for the whole oil sector.\u201d The Goldman report came as the price of Brent crude for delivery December fell by as much as $1.02 to $85.11 a barrel in London on Monday. The price has fallen by about a quarter over the past five months. Goldman has forecast that the price will stay flat in the New year, as it estimated that Brent crude will cost $85 a barrel in the first quarter of 2015, down from a previous forecast of $100. Goldman\u2019s shift makes it the most pessimistic of the big banks cutting forecasts as worries grow about the prospects for global growth. Last week Standard Chartered analysts reduced their 2015 forecast for Brent crude from $110 a barrel to $105. The fall in oil prices has accelerated in recent weeks, with supplies in abundance as leading Opec members resisted calls to cut production. The US, in the midst of a shale oil boom, is producing at the fastest rate in almost three decades while Russian output is close to a post-Soviet record. Goldman expects production to increase in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. At the same time, doubts are rising about economic growth. The International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecasts for this year and 2015 earlier this month, warning that the world economy might never achieve the pace of expansion achieved before the financial crisis. Recent economic figures from the US have been weak and growth in China, the second biggest oil consumer after the US, has fallen to a five-year low. Growth in demand has averaged 630,000 barrels a day this year, less than half Goldman\u2019s initial forecast for 2014. The 12 mainly Middle Eastern Opec members meet at the end of next month to discuss adjusting the output target of 30m barrels a day. Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest oil producer and a member of Opec, has indicated it is content to maintain supply levels. Opec, which produces about 40% of the world\u2019s oil, will lose its influence as a \u201cfirst-mover swing producer\u201d as output from US shale reserves erodes Opec\u2019s pricing power, the Goldman analysts said. The falling price of oil could spell bad news for Britain\u2019s big oil companies BP and Royal Dutch Shell, which report their third-quarter results this week starting with BP on Tuesday. But for hard-pressed households, falling market prices are starting to feed through to the petrol pumps. Asda announced that from today it was reducing the price of petrol and diesel by 2p a litre. Morrisons followed by saying it would cut petrol and diesel by up to 2p a litre. Asda said the price of its petrol would be fall to 120.7p a litre and that diesel would be cut to 124.7p a litre \u2013 its lowest prices since December 2010. The AA\u2019s head of roads policy, Paul Watters, said: \u201cThese latest price moves are a timely boost for UK families as they see fuel consumption go up with the start of winter driving and the heating being switched on at home.\u201d Simon Williams, fuel spokesman for the RAC, said there was still a big gap between wholesale and retail prices, allowing prices at petrol stations to fall further. \u201cOil continues to be pumped way above global demand which, combined with a strong pound, is good news for motorists,\u201d he added.",
