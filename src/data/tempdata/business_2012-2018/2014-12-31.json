      "body": "<p>The word \u201cvolatile\u201d could have been coined to describe the stock market in 2014. Early in the year we were dusting off the record books as the FTSE 100 \u2013 supported by central banks keeping the money taps turned on to boost flagging economies \u2013 came within 52 points of the peak achieved in December 1999 at the time of the dotcom boom.</p> <p>But the London index, weighed down as it is with commodity companies dependent on global growth and energy companies affected by the oil price, never did hit that peak as fears of a slowdown grew during the year. The strength of sterling hitting companies\u2019 overseas earnings was another factor holding it back.</p> <p>Other markets with more varied constituents \u2013 notably America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 and Germany\u2019s Dax \u2013 continued to set new records and defy bad news. Even so, as the year progressed, that bad news seemed to mount up. Central banks started cutting back their support \u2013 entirely in the case of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s bond buying programme \u2013 and talk of interest rate rises began to be heard. On top of that, there were doubts over the Chinese economy, the eurozone crisis re-emerged with political upheaval in Greece, while investors also had to contend with a plunge in the oil price and a rouble crisis in Russia, all of which combined to send UK shares to new lows for the year in December.</p> <p>With a late, albeit unconvincing, Christmas rally, the FTSE 100 closed at 6566.09, still down 2.7% on the year, its first annual loss since 2011. And for the first time since 2002, the index failed to gain ground during December.</p> <p>So what of our tips for 2014? With the FTSE 100 in decline, we managed a very creditable 2.3% gain on the year.</p> <p>It was the US that really did us proud, with Apple and the US medical equipment firm Stryker striding ahead and outperforming even a buoyant Dow Jones industrial average and S&amp;P 500.</p> <p>America was also helpful for another good performer, the building materials group Wolseley, which does a large chunk of its business across the Atlantic.</p> <p>Budget airline Flybe had a late run, benefiting from cheaper fuel costs in the wake of the oil price decline, while the recruitment group Hays did well in its key areas of Britain, Australia and Germany.</p> <p>But there were some less successful picks, notably Salamander Energy which fell back after disappointing exploration results in south-east Asia. This left it open to an opportunistic low priced bid, which Ophir Energy seems to have won after Spanish rival Cepsa pulled out of the running.</p> <p>Sportech was also a bad bet, which fell foul of a poor performance in its US racing business and a ruling it had to repay \u00a393m to HMRC relating to a VAT dispute on Spot the Ball games. It plans to appeal.</p> <p>As a reminder, the 12-month period we use for these tips is an arbitrary time period for tracking a share price. In the real world, investors would be likely to cash in any gains \u2013 or take any losses \u2013 at different times of the year, rather than wait until 31 December. With that in mind, here are our picks for 2015, which range from FTSE 100 stalwarts to a few lesser known businesses with growth potential.</p> <h2><strong>Simon Goodley</strong></h2> <p>City analysts spend all year feeding numbers into spreadsheets and routinely fail to outperform the market. So, if all that effort struggles to unearth winners, maybe humble retail investors are better served trying a different approach. On that basis, the pub group JD Wetherspoon, now 820p, might get the nod in 2015. Not on the basis of a rigorous analysis of its business \u2013 although it plans 200 new pubs including an ambitious expansion in Ireland \u2013 but purely as a punt on its chairman and founder, Tim Martin. He knows the trade backwards and, more pleasingly, he can\u2019t stand financiers (the feeling is mutual). That doesn\u2019t mean the shares will go up every year, but simply backing Martin probably gives you as good a chance of a profit as siding with the pros.</p> <h2><strong>Juliette Garside</strong></h2> <p>CityFibre listed on Aim in January 2014. The pint-sized infrastructure company has a big ambition: building fibre optics into commercial and residential areas underserved by BT\u2019s superfast network. It also has big allies \u2013 Sky and TalkTalk are funding fibre to the home pilot in York. If it proves economical, the plan is to extend the scheme to Britain\u2019s 50 or so second-tier cities. With Vodafone waiting in the wings to join the scheme, CityFibre could be heading for rapid expansion. The shares, listed at 60p, have risen to more than 80p, so the current 63p price is a buying opportunity.</p> <h2><strong>Sean Farrell</strong></h2> <p>B&amp;M European\u2019s shares haven\u2019t caught fire since July\u2019s flotation and sit at 285p. But 2015 could be the year the discount general retailer demonstrates its worth. Like Aldi and Lidl, B&amp;M has gained from squeezed household budgets and the rise of bargain hunting. The Liverpool-based group has about 400 stores but hardly any in the south of England. It has ambitious plans to put that right through a new store programme that is ahead of schedule. B&amp;M, chaired by former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy, is also expanding in Germany, home to some of Europe\u2019s most frugal shoppers.</p> <h2><strong>Terry Macalister</strong></h2> <p>Anyone looking for an investment with a clear conscience could support the appropriately-named Good Energy. The Wiltshire-based firm, which generates all its electricity from renewables, has seen a surge in retail customers who have been leaving the big six suppliers. Good Energy profits more than doubled last year and yet the business remains relatively small with plenty of scope for growth. The share price doubled in value in 2103 but has tumbled since, alongside falling oil and other energy prices. At their current level of 211p there should be scope for a rebound.</p> <h2><strong>Julia Kollewe</strong></h2> <p>AstraZeneca has had an exciting year: the UK pharmaceutical firm successfully fought off Pfizer\u2019s advances in May and spent the rest of the year under the shadow of a potential new bid, which never materialised. AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot trumpeted the company\u2019s drug pipeline and was able to boast of some early successes. While his long-term goals look ambitious, the firm \u201clooks completely different than two years ago\u201d, according to Morgan Stanley. Some of this is already in the share price, now 4555.5p, but we reckon the stock has further to go.</p> <h2><strong>Gwyn Topham</strong></h2> <p>How much higher can airlines\u2019 stock climb? EasyJet, Ryanair and International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways, are trading at two or three times their value from two years ago. All will be further boosted by the sudden drop in fuel prices, the biggest fixed cost that has cut margins in the last few years. While investors show signs of believing easyJet\u2019s price has peaked, IAG, at 486.1p, could still go up. The apparent newfound stability at Iberia, steady profits at BA, the addition of Vueling \u2013 as well as the potential acquisition of Aer Lingus to secure more lucrative transatlantic business \u2013 give the group a solid look and have quietened for now the sceptics of the consolidation strategy.</p> <h2><strong>Zoe Wood</strong></h2> <p>AO World arrived on the stock exchange with a bang in February. But that first day pop, when the shares rocketed 45% above its 285p debut, was shortlived and the stock now treads water below the float price at 280.2p. The air may have leaked out of internet stocks but ao.com still offers a slice of some interesting retail action. It has slick logistics and the scope to expand from its mainstay of white goods into TVs and beyond. It also has ambition by the truckload thanks to driven founder John Roberts with the recent push into Germany appearing well thought through.</p> <h2><strong>Sarah Butler</strong></h2> <p>The hot summer was a boon for fashion retailers but they have suffered as the balmy temperatures continued into the autumn and winter, hitting sales in a much more significant trading period. With that in mind, tipping a fashion retailer may seem unwise. Discounts on coats and knitwear are everywhere and few will escape unscathed. But Boohoo, which joined the junior Aim market this summer, has all the hallmarks of a business which can outshine its peers.</p> <p>Boohoo is a fairly young business with plenty of opportunity to expand in the UK, as well as abroad. The share price has suffered by association with online fashion store Asos, which has suffered from an array of problems, some of which were self-generated. Boohoo will have to deal with the impact of the rising value of the pound on its overseas business, but its shares are still loitering well below its float price at 39.5p. That seems like an oversight as we head towards potentially easier times for UK consumers.</p> <h2><strong>Jill Treanor</strong></h2> <p>Aviva had a rocky end to 2014. It secured a deal which made it the biggest insurance, savings and asset management company in Britain by buying Friends Life but in the process dented its own stock market value, with its shares now at 484.5p. There are lots of reasons to be cautious about the share market in 2015; the general election leaves many sectors vulnerable. George Osborne sent shockwaves through the insurance sector in 2014 with plans to overhaul the pensions market and no longer make it compulsory to buy an annuity.</p> <p>With the proviso that the insurance market could again become the focus for politicians, Aviva may recover lost ground if investors conclude that the Friends deal is not as awful as it first appeared and have confidence that the enlarged insurer will be able ratchet up its dividend payouts.</p> <h2><strong>Nick Fletcher</strong></h2> <p>Software Radio Technology supplies technology and products to track marine vessels around the globe, using the International Marine Organisation\u2019s AIS standard. It has about 95% of this market, and part of its growth has come from governments mandating ship owners to use tracking equipment.</p> <p>A key market will be the US, and the country\u2019s coastguard is due to publish a final ruling on using AIS in January, which means more than 40,000 boats would be required to install new equipment within a few months. This could be worth $35m (\u00a323m) in revenues to a business that has annual sales of around \u00a36m. With other projects under way, including tracking national fishing fleets in Malaysia and India and further out, Russia and South America, SRT should see a less lumpy ordering pattern in future.</p> <p>The shares at 30.87p have shown a recent rise in anticipation of the US ruling, but could have further to go.</p>",

      "bodyText": "More than 2,300 City Link workers who discovered their employer was going bust on Christmas Day were made redundant on New Year\u2019s Eve. The administrators of the delivery company owned by multimillionaire Tory donor Jon Moulton made 2,356 employees redundant at 4.30pm on Wednesday. Moulton, whose Better Capital private equity firm bought City Link for \u00a31 in 2013, said he had done everything he could to keep the company going and was very sorry that the collapse ruined Christmas and New Year for so many people. \u201cOf course, I wish it would come on different days,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did everything we could to make sure the announcement would be on Boxing Day, not Christmas Day. It [would have] still been horrible, but a little less horrible.\u201d Moulton, who donated \u00a3450,000 to the Conservatives between 2004 and 2011, said Better Capital had probably lost about \u00a320m trying to keep City Link going. Accountants at EY told staff that just 371 of them were to be kept on, but only until a backlog of undelivered Christmas orders had been cleared and the company was wound up. \u201cIt is with regret that we have to announce substantial redundancies at City Link Ltd, which ceased accepting new parcels on 24 December 2014,\u201d said joint administrator Hunter Kelly. \u201cThe company endured substantial losses, which ultimately became too great for it to continue as a going concern, and City Link Ltd entered administration following an unsuccessful sale process. \u201cAt meetings across City Link\u2019s UK sites on Monday December 29 and Tuesday December 30, employees were informed that there would be substantial redundancies as no new business was being taken on. Many of these employees were sent home and informed that they would shortly receive formal correspondence to confirm their work status.\u201d The redundancies came despite a last-minute bid to save the company. The administrators said the unnamed consortium\u2019s bid \u201coffered no money up front and significantly undervalued the assets to be acquired\u201d. Moulton said the consortium was headed by an \u201cunknown businessman from Stoke-on-Trent\u201d. He said he had tried to sell City Link to Amazon, its biggest customer, in the months before the delivery company\u2019s collapse. The redundancies will affect the head office in Coventry as well as hubs and depots around the country. There will be 468 job losses in \u201ccentral functions\u201d, which includes head office staff, and a further 279 staff will lose their jobs in the Coventry hub. Mick Cash, the general secretary of the RMT union, said: \u201cThe confirmation from the administrators that they have just sacked 2,400 staff and are pulling the plug on any efforts to save City Link is a disgraceful and cynical betrayal that will wreck the lives of our members, many of whom are owed thousands of pounds. \u201cRMT does not believe that those pulling the strings had any interest in saving this business and were happy to cut and run, leaving a trail of human misery in their wake. The City Link collapse has blown the lid off the cosy relationship between bandit capitalism and the political elite. \u201cRMT will continue to advise and represent our members caught in this corporate failure. Those responsible will slink away with their own resources ringfenced and leaving the taxpayer to pick up the redundancy tab. The City Link Christmas destruction is an act of industrial vandalism that shames our nation while the Government looked on and offered nothing but hollow words.\u201d Moulton said he hoped \u201cat least a good proportion\u201d of the redundant City Link staff would get new jobs soon. \u201cThe administrators said at least 60 employers were chasing them.\u201d On Tuesday, the courier company APC Overnight said it would give priority to City Link staff in filling up to 100 vacancies at its national sorting centre in Cannock, Staffordshire. On top of the 2,356 City Link redundancies, 1,000 self-employed drivers face serious financial difficulties with some small businesses owed up to \u00a321,000 in back pay. Phil Valentine, a freelance who runs five vehicles for City Link in the Lake District, said he was owed about \u00a321,000 for two and a half weeks\u2019 work. During that time, he had incurred expenses including drivers\u2019 wages and insurance for the vans plus a \u00a33,000 fuel bill. He has been told he is unlikely to receive any of the money he is owed and will now have to seek new work and pay out as much as \u00a31,200 per van to have them resprayed in the livery of any new employer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a struggle. Even if I find new work, I may have to wait six weeks until I get paid,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat baffles me is that they knew we were all self-employed but they let us run up debts and deliver parcels when they must have known we wouldn\u2019t get paid.\u201d Fellow Lake District courier Mike Parkinson, who has worked for City Link for 15 years, said he was owed about \u00a37,500 for two weeks\u2019 work and was stuck with ongoing costs of more than \u00a33,000 a week to lease and insure the two vans he runs. \u201cI\u2019m panicking and have been sending emails to every single courier company but they are going to be inundated with drivers,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "Oil price dips further as US opens crude exports", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The price of oil plunged to $55.91 per barrel on Wednesday as the US opened the way to crude exports and China produced another set of downbeat economic statistics that pointed to a global slowdown. The moves triggered a new bout of cost-cutting at supermarket forecourts in Britain with Asda and Morrisons unveiling plans to slice a further 2p per litre off petrol and diesel. The price of Brent crude oil is now 50% lower than it was in June when commodity traders and analysts woke up to the fact that a combination of increased American fossil fuel production and weak global demand could produce an energy glut. Brent was down by more than 3% at just under $56 at midday in the wake of moves by Barack Obama\u2019s administration to loosen restrictions on exports. The Department of Commerce in Washington said it had begun to approve requests to ship overseas processed light oil products after a long period of intense political debate. Analysts said the move could lead to over 1m barrels of ultra-light US crude entering the global market, intensifying a battle with Saudi Arabia and Opec. \u201cIn practice this long-awaited move can open up the floodgates to substantial increases in exports by end 2015,\u201d said Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup bank. The latest decline in the crude price was accelerated by new data from China showing that its factory sector shrank for the first time in seven months in December. The final HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for this month came in at 49.6, down from 50.0 in November \u2013 with any reading lower than 50 indicating a contraction. \u201cClearly, demand concerns are one of the issues for the oil market,\u201d Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, told Reuters. China is the world\u2019s second-largest oil consumer and any contraction in its factory sector can have a major impact on demand. The fall in energy prices should help countries which are heavily dependent on oil imports but they will have a mixed impact on Britain. The UK has an important North Sea industry but still imports half its needs. Asda said its pump price reductions would mean motorists would be charged no more than 107.7p a litre for petrol, with diesel at 114.7p a litre. This is the 13th cut in prices by the supermarket since the end of September and in total it takes 19p a litre off petrol and 15p a litre off diesel. For Morrisons, it is the sixth cut since the beginning of December. The AA motoring organisation said these moves would have a positive impact on the wider economy although it cautioned against predicting further falls. \u201cThe UK average price for petrol is currently around 113p per litre and these welcome decisions on making further price cuts will eventually filter down in some form to other retailers,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cSo the UK average price will fall further as we enter 2015. However, just how far it falls is anyone\u2019s bet. Current indications are that the magical \u00a31-per-litre average price across the UK is still looking unlikely in the short term,\u201d it added. But the damaging flipside of a low oil price was provided by a now besieged North Sea oil and gas industry, which said the price slump was causing major problems. The oil and gas industry supports an estimated 450,000 jobs in the UK and is particularly important to Scotland\u2019s economy. Mike Tholen, economic director at the Oil &amp; Gas UK lobby group, told the BBC: \u201cWe are already seeing, even at $60 a barrel, that about 10% of our production could be at risk if we see low prices continue. \u201cInevitably there will be downward pressure on employment. I\u2019m afraid people will lose their jobs at low prices \u2013 that is a tragedy and I will be working very closely with the government to try and mitigate.\u201d Shell, BP and other oil companies have already started to cut jobs. In the US one of the first projects to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the rest of the world has been put on hold. Excelerate Energy, which also operates a gas plant in the north-east of England, has postponed a scheme to build a floating export terminal at Lavaca Bay, Texas \u2013 at least until April. There are now fears that a host of other LNG export facilities, designed to ship US shale gas abroad including to the UK, will also be shelved.",

An arbitration tribunal in Singapore ruled that Rosan Roeslani, who formerly headed Berau Coal, the Borneo mine in which the group held an 85% stake, was obliged to honour an agreement to repay the multimillion-pound sum plus accrued interest and legal costs. Roeslani had signed a contract in summer 2013 agreeing to repay the missing money, without admitting liability. Bumi had told shareholders the missing money related to spending for which there was \u201cno clear business purpose\u201d. ARMS has yet to recoup the funds despite having secured an asset-freezing ruling in France on two French properties that Roeslani owns \u2013 Ch\u00e2teau de Bonaban and Ch\u00e2teau de la Gr\u00e9nerie. Meanwhile, Roeslani has emerged as one of a trio of Indonesian businessmen who took over Italian football club Inter Milan. Roeslani was forced to resign from the Bumi board in December 2012, after the Takeover Panel revealed he had failed to disclose he was a member of a shareholder concert party with the Bakrie family, who co-founded Bumi with financier Nat Rothschild. Roeslani sold his 13.4% voting stake in Bumi in February 2013 for about \u00a390m. Bumi was founded in a $3bn deal when the powerful Bakrie family placed its coal assets into a cash shell formed by Rothschild. The two sides fell out amid accusations of financial irregularities \u2013 strongly denied by the family \u2013 and a whistleblower report, which the company alleged was based on hacked emails. In February 2013, Rothschild failed in his attempt to gain control of Bumi but the tie-up ended when the family bought back the Bumi Resources division, leaving ARMS with Berau Coal.",

The leading index is currently at 6562, down 2.77% on the year so far, its first annual fall since 2011. And for the first time since 2002, the index will not see a rise during December. Most City experts, however, were expecting the index to beat its all time closing high of 6930 by the end of 2014, and although it came close a couple of times that never happened. Now they think that record will be broken next year. Morgan Stanley has a December 2015 target for the FTSE 100 of 7200, but says the UK will continue to lag behind other markets: We see four reasons why the UK will continue to underperform: a) weaker 2015 estimated earnings per share growth (4% in the UK versus 10% in Europe); b) average valuations; c) foreign exchange headwinds from the pound and US dollar; d) political risk around the general election. Barclays meanwhile has a year end FTSE target of 7300, while Citigroup goes higher with 7700, saying: [It is] hard to be that bullish based on earnings alone with three consecutive years of negative earnings growth in the bag and commodity downgrades threatening to take 2015 estimated earnings growth negative.

We stick with our end-2015 FTSE 100 target of 7700. UK shares look cheap versus rest of world and versus credit/bonds. As a reminder Barclays was expecting the FTSE 100 index to end 2014 at a record level of 7400, Citigroup was looking for 8000 and Morgan Stanley forecasting 7220 so they have all empered their optimism a little this time around.",
