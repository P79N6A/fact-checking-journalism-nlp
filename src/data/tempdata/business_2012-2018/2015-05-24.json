      "bodyText": "The free-market thinktank that inspired many of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s reforms has now turned critic of the Iron Lady\u2019s shakeup of the City in the 1980s, suggesting it increased state regulation of the financial sector, making it too burdensome. While the left has blamed the liberalisation of finance under Thatcher for the crisis that paralysed the banking system and led to the deepest UK recession of the post-war era, the Institute for Economic Affairs says the 1980s involved private regulation being replaced by less effective statutory regulation. Philip Booth, the IEA\u2019s editorial and programme director, says in a new pamphlet that Thatcher\u2019s record was mixed \u2013 with deregulatory policies such as the abolition of exchange controls in 1979 and the opening up of the City in Big Bang reforms of 1986 accompanied by tougher state controls that have increased the cost of regulation 15-fold. \u201cThe Thatcher government presided over a significant increase in the statutory regulation of financial services,\u201d Booth says in Thatcher: myth of deregulation? \u201cThis involved a growth of regulatory bureaucracies, detailed financial regulation and the cost of regulation.\u201d London\u2019s position as a global financial centre was reinforced by Big Bang, which ended fixed commissions for share trading, abolished the distinction between brokers and jobbers, and allowed foreign ownership of UK firms. Over the next two decades, the UK financial sector grew in size but in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007-09 all parties agreed that regulation had been too lax. Since 2010, George Osborne has toughened up regulation and put the Bank of England in control of City supervision. Booth\u2019s pamphlet challenges the view that the 1980s was an era of deregulation. \u201cIt is commonly believed that during the 1980s Margaret Thatcher presided over a substantial reduction in government regulation for financial services. Indeed, some have blamed this deregulation for the financial crash that took place nearly 30 years after 1979. \u201cBig Bang in 1986 did remove the restrictive practices and largely private regulation that existed in securities markets. However, this involved the state unwinding systems of private regulation and was not, as such, a simple act of deregulation.\u201d Booth says the Financial Services Act that was passed in 1986, the same year as Big Bang, involved a \u201cmajor expansion of regulation\u201d. Retail financial products that had previously been regulated by contract law, professions and industry agreements became heavily regulated at the retail level through the Financial Services Act. Booth says industry agreements that had been effective in reducing \u201cmis-selling\u201d, such as the maximum commission agreement, were made unlawful, while government regulation of employment contracts, which required firms to allow employees to opt out of occupational pension schemes, led to the pensions mis-selling scandal of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The IEA study says there were around 80 people involved in bank regulation in 1979, with a small number of people supervising the insurance industry from the Department of Trade and Industry/Board of Trade. \u201cBy 1990, the number of employees involved in financial regulation had risen roughly five-fold \u2013 with the number involved in non-commercial bank regulation rising by a much greater margin. Overall, from 1979 to 2010 there was an increase from one regulator for every 11,000 people employed in finance to one regulator for every 300 people employed in finance. \u201cSince the 1980s, the financial sector has been regulated by statutory bodies developing thousands of paragraphs of prescriptive statutory regulation and has gradually extended its reach into new fields. It is true that Thatcher undertook certain liberalising reforms such as the abolition of exchange controls. However, state regulation of securities and financial markets became much more intrusive.\u201d Booth says that if the cause of the recent financial crash was deregulation, \u201cthen it has to be accepted that markets developed more comprehensive systems of regulation when left to themselves than when governments started to regulate them after 1986\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Rag trade brothers help turn around Marks & Spencer's fortunes", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Two veteran rag trade brothers who came out of retirement to help turn around the fortunes of Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s clothing business delivered as much as \u00a372m to the bottom line last year. Neal and Mark Lindsey, 65 and 62, were hardly mentioned when M&amp;S\u2019s chief executive, Marc Bolland, this week triumphantly unveiled the company\u2019s first annual rise in profits in four years. Recruited last year with the offer of a three-year contract \u2013 under which, according to industry gossips, they stand to earn millions of pounds a year \u2013 the brothers have been shaking up the way M&amp;S buys and makes its clothing. The two multimillionaire Londoners are described by fellow fashion industry insiders as charismatic hard men who know the international network of clothing suppliers from top to bottom. Now based in Hong Kong, although they retain homes in the UK, they\u2019re friends with celebrity businessmen such as the Topshop boss Philip Green and Richard Caring, owner of a string of restaurants and private clubs including the Ivy, who also started out supplying clothing to the high street. Unlike those two, however, who are frequently been photographed and have seen their business lives scrutinised, the Lindseys have stayed out of the limelight. \u201cThey don\u2019t fit the normal executive format. They have been successful because they are gamblers,\u201d says one industry insider. \u201cBut they have always lived a colourful lifestyle. Both live life at 100 miles an hour.\u201d \u201cThey were party animals, two chippy guys from London,\u201d says another industry veteran who knew the Lindseys in the 1980s. The Lindseys are best known for helping M&amp;S\u2019s rival Next become more efficient in the way it buys clothing. Their efforts helped build Next into a far more profitable business than M&amp;S, despite the latter ringing up more than twice the level of sales each year. Those who know them say the Lindsays learned their trade working Saturdays and school holidays in their uncle\u2019s menswear store in Golders Green in the 1960s. Both then moved on to work for Rael Brook, a shirtmaker then in its heyday, and in the late 1960s they began importing from Hong Kong and India under the brand Southern Comfort. In 1975 they started Nashville Fashionwear, a joint venture with Raybeck, a clothing manufacturer and retailer which at one point owned 300 stores including the Lord John and Berkertex chains. The pair helped Raybeck move into menswear and built up a formidable range of contacts with overseas manufacturers. The business made own-label clothing for high street retailers including the Burton Group, which then owned Debenhams and Topshop, as well as their own Nashville brand. They spied the potential business opportunity in making clothing where materials and labour were far cheaper than the UK, and in the mid-1970s the pair moved to Hong Kong to mastermind operations from there. \u201cIt was an exciting time in the industry and they were among the big boys, stars among it all,\u201d says one industry source. \u201cThey were famous for their fantastic parties.\u201d Neal is tall and slim while his brother Mark is shorter and broader. \u201cThey\u2019re known in the industry as the Mitchell brothers,\u201d says one former colleague, referring to the characters from soap opera EastEnders. In an 1989 interview with the trade journal Men\u2019s Wear, Neal explained their relationship. \u201cWe have always worked together and I think the people that know us, whether they like us or not, will recognise that our relationship is the strength of our business. Because we\u2019re brothers, there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t have to say to each other because we both know what the other is thinking. And, of course, we both have total trust, which is a big help in a partnership.\u201d Having built a reputation with Nashville, the pair were approached by Richard Caring to help set up a sourcing operation for Next in \u201cnear east\u201d countries including Turkey, Romania and Sri Lanka. Nashville merged into Caring\u2019s ICD Group, and the Lindseys ran and co-owned the business, known as NV Production, with Neal living in Sri Lankaand Mark based in Romania. In 2002 Caring and the Lindseys, who owned just under half of NV, sold out to Next and the Lindseys stayed on to work directly for the retailer. The business was merged with Next\u2019s far east buying operation to become Next Near East in 2005 and the brothers ran the whole show until they retired in 2005. They were set to put their feet up before being approached by Marks &amp; Spencer. \u201cThey will make millions if they get the sourcing right. I don\u2019t think they would have come out of retirement otherwise. They are already very wealthy guys,\u201d says one friend. They will be rewarded for every point of extra profit margin they can secure for M&amp;S, and so far it is going well. M&amp;S\u2019 gross profit on its clothing and homewares business rose by \u00a324m last year as margin gains compensated for a 2.5% fall in sales. There was a 1.9 percentage point rise in gross margins on clothing and homewares, and M&amp;S credited 1.8 percentage points of that gain to cutting better deals with suppliers \u2013 a figure analysts said was equivalent to about \u00a372m. One of the UK\u2019s oldest clothing retailers, M&amp;S has been struggling for years to make changes to the way it buys clothing in order to become more profitable. While Bolland has tried to emphasise that a team effort is behind the recent changes, industry experts insist the recent improvement is largely down to the Lindsey brothers. \u201cThey know what they are doing and have enormous range of contacts. M&amp;S has never got hold of its supply chain. They have too much history with big UK organisations with big UK overheads. M&amp;S needed someone without that history or emotional attachment,\u201d says one industry source who knows the Lindseys well. Some long-term M&amp;S partners, including Dewhirst and Courtaulds, are among a string of suppliers who have lost business or seen their profit margins squeezed as the Lindseys renegotiate terms. Israeli suit manufacturer Bagir Group was forced to issue a profits warning after M&amp;S cut orders in May last year. The Lindseys have torn up relationships that have lasted decades and helped implement a new way of working in which more clothing is designed in-house. Until recently, M&amp;S had only a handful of its own designers, instead using \u201cfull service\u201d suppliers who would present a range of different fashions for M&amp;S buyers to choose from. Now there are 130 in-house design staff and another 30 freelancers. That is giving the retailer more control over the fashions it sells and more freedom to find the best deals with suppliers. In 2013 M&amp;S bought a fifth of its clothing directly from suppliers; now it is about 35%, and the company intends to increase that proportion to 60% by 2017. Industry sources report that the Lindseys have introduced an auction system for some basic clothing lines, asking a number of different suppliers to offer their best price on each item. Some rivals suggest that the change of approach, moving away from long-established supplier relationships, carries the risk that M&amp;S will lose the high ethical and sustainability standards that it has built its reputation on. But an insider said M&amp;S would not take big risks with that reputation, even if it did offer bigger profits. \u201cRegardless of the agenda on margin, someone is going to make sure they don\u2019t give [on ethical standards]. M&amp;S\u2019s reputation is massive, I\u2019m not sure they would take that risk.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Barclays paid a \u201clone wolf\u201d star trader \u00a3170m in the five years following the financial crisis, a payout which dwarfed those of Bob Diamond, the bank\u2019s former boss. Jonathan Hoffman\u2019s earnings included an $83m (\u00a352m) payment to the trader who previously worked for Lehman Brothers, the US bank that collapsed in 2008 kicking off the global financial crisis. Hoffman\u2019s payout from Barclays has emerged in court papers relating to his battle at a New York court to secure $83m in unpaid bonuses from his days at Lehman, from the bank\u2019s bankruptcy trustee. Trustee James W Giddens has accused Hoffman of \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d, saying the payment from Barclays had already compensated him for the lost Lehmans bonuses. In a deposition, Michael Keegan, a Barclays managing director, recalled thinking Hoffman was a \u201csneaky bastard\u201d for seeking payment from the Lehman estate because he had assumed Barclays\u2019 payout had been intended as compensation for the lost Lehman payouts. \u201cI thought he was paid for it,\u201d Keegan said. However, he conceded that Barclays chose to pay Hoffman and was under no obligation to do so. Barclays wanted to secure the services of high-rolling Lehman traders including Hoffman after buying out the bank\u2019s investment arm. Hoffman has argued his payment was related to Barclays\u2019 desire to secure his services against competing job offers from elsewhere. He said he was incredibly loyal to Lehman and did a good job for them. \u201cIf I am owed money by the estate, it\u2019s not clear to me why I would not collect it,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal. His lawyer Douglas Baumstein told the Guardian: \u201cHoffman was not paid for his Lehman bonus by Barclays. Rather, as the contemporaneous evidence shows, the payments made to Mr. Hoffman were retention payments, made to induce Mr. Hoffman to accept employment and to remain at Barclays for a period of years.\u201d He said his client had earned Barclays more than $1.25bn. The scale of the payouts offers a rare glimpse into the sky-high earnings of star traders who underpin the global banking system. Their deals are usually kept under wraps because companies are only obliged to reveal the pay and bonuses of their senior executive officers under the Project Merlin deal, in which banks promised the UK government to show restraint on pay. The deal was struck amid widespread anger at the pay of bankers in the wake of the financial crisis. The son of a sweet manufacturer, Hoffman began working for Lehman in 1994 and became an expert in trading US government debt. By the time the bank collapsed he was working from a small Lehman office in Miami and living on the exclusive Palm Island, just off Miami Beach. \u201cI never had a losing quarter, never had a losing year,\u201d he told the court. He said he was typically allocated between $200m and $400m of the Lehmans capital to trade with. Hoffman has said his style had \u201cquite a bit of gut in it\u201d and related to watching the way trades were flowing. \u201cI have no view on interest rates, no view on the curve,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cI never speak to clients. I don\u2019t know who is on the other side of the trade. I guess I am a lone wolf.\u201d It has emerged that Hoffman, who left Barclays in 2013 and now trades with his own money from his home in Philadelphia, received a base salary of $200,000 a year, but his contract with Barclays also entitled him to 12% of the first $25m of profits he made from trading and 14% on anything above. That meant that he earned $183m (\u00a3118m) from 2009 to 2013, according to his Baumstein. Diamond, who was forced out of Barclays in 2012 in the wake of a scandal over rigging of the Libor rate which governs the rate at which banks lend to each other, took home about \u00a3120m over the five years from 2007 according to analysis from the Pensions and Investment Research Consultants. Barclays was widely criticised for the high level of pay allotted to Diamond, known as Red after his initials. He was at the centre of a row over his \u00a32.7m bonus for 2012 in the months before he quit. The bank was faced with a shareholder rebellion in protest against his proposed payout. Barclays declined to comment. Hoffman was unavailable for comment.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s Monday morning and you arrive at the station to find that your train has been cancelled due to a points failure. You miss an important meeting. On Tuesday your desktop computer crashes yet again. IT says the problem is simple: the computer is old and needs to be replaced. Wednesday rolls around and you take your car in to be repaired. Later, you get a call from the garage apologising for the fact that the job cannot be completed that day. A new member of staff has forgotten to send off for a crucial part. Come Thursday and you pop out for a coffee. The locally owned business you have been patronising is virtually empty, as it has been since the darkest days of the recession. You wonder to yourself how it keeps going. By Friday, you have got your car back and head to an out-of-town shopping centre to buy yourself a new fridge-freezer. Wandering around the store, you are taken by how many of the appliances are foreign-made these days. In their different ways, these five slices of everyday life explain why George Osborne will be publishing a productivity plan before his summer budget in early July. When the chancellor says he wants the economy to find another gear, it\u2019s not so much the speed at which the UK is expanding that concerns him, it is the quality of that growth. The increases in national output since the economy reached its trough in 2009 have been largely the result of a bigger population and an increase in the workforce. There has been scant evidence of the usual pickup in productivity that normally accompanies an economic recovery, and after almost six years the argument that an improvement is imminent has worn thin. To make matters even more puzzling, the flatlining of productivity since the crisis is in marked contrast to a strong performance in the years before the recession. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the UK\u2019s record was on a par with that of the US and a lot better than Germany\u2019s. Had the pre-2008 pattern continued, output per head would be around 15% higher than it currently is, and since higher productivity means higher living standards, the nation would be better off. There are a couple of factors that help to explain the disparity between the UK\u2019s pre- and post-crisis productivity performance. There has been a structural decline in North Sea gas and oil production \u2013 a capital-intensive sector where output per head is high. In addition, work by the Bank of England has shown that the other sector to have suffered in the early years of the recovery was business services. This sector includes the City and real estate, both important to the UK economy. While the long-term trends in North Sea production are clear, it is possible that the decline in productivity in business services will recover as demand increases. But the Bank of England thinks there has been permanent damage caused by the recession. Its governor, Mark Carney, said earlier this month that productivity growth would return towards, but remain below, pre-crisis growth rates. That explains why Osborne has embarked on his productivity drive. He is not the first to travel down this path. Barbara Castle was made secretary of state for the combined department of employment and productivity in the 1960s. Gordon Brown set up a productivity unit inside the Treasury when he was chancellor. The five examples above explain what needs to be done. Firstly, there needs to be action to improve Britain\u2019s physical infrastructure. There are productivity losses from people waiting for trains, sitting in traffic jams and being stuck in a holding pattern over Heathrow. Over many decades and under governments of both left and right, capital spending has been the first to come under the axe when savings have been needed. This does not have to happen. Secondly, the UK has for many years tended to spend less on investment in new plant and machinery than its peers. Companies have sweated their assets, running machines into the ground rather than replacing them with new and better equipment. With labour cheap and plentiful, and finance dear and hard to come by, companies have expanded output by using more labour rather than by using more capital. The problem here is partly structural \u2013 Britain\u2019s flexible labour market and short-termist financial markets militate towards a labour-rich/capital-poor approach \u2013 but it is also due to a deep-seated cultural bias against investment. New initiatives in banking \u2013 the business bank and challenger banks in the high street \u2013 will help, but changing the culture is not going to be easy. It is not just a question of having the latest kit: the quality of the workforce matters too. The third challenge was outlined by Osborne last week, when he said: \u201cThe level of skills in our country is unacceptable \u2013 we\u2019re one of only three OECD countries where the skills of our 16-to-24-year-olds are no better than our 55-to-65-year-olds.\u201d The chancellor is right. Britain has too many workers who struggle to read and write, lack basic skills and are not receiving sufficient training. They can find work but only in low-productivity jobs. The fourth issue boils down to what could loosely be termed creative destruction: whether new dynamic firms are replacing those that are suffering from weak demand. There has been much debate about whether a prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates and forbearance by the banks towards struggling companies has created a generation of zombie companies. This, though, misses the point. As noted above, it is unusual for the UK financial sector to be so merciful and short-termist: business as usual will no doubt be resumed before too long. Britain has never had a problem with the destructive bit of creative destruction. The problem has been with spawning and nurturing the innovation that produces high-productivity jobs \u2013 turning good ideas into world-beating products. This process is not aided by the fifth problem: the lopsided nature of Britain\u2019s economy, where the manufacturing sector makes up just over 10% of GDP and the service sector more than 75% of GDP. Productivity gains are not impossible in the service sector, but in some cases, such as hairdressing, they are harder to come by, and in other cases \u2013 think schools \u2013 they would not be especially desirable if increasing output-per-head meant bigger class sizes. That means increasing the share of the economy \u2013 manufacturing and parts of the service sector \u2013 where it is possible to increase output per hour worked. It also means improving the quality of those services where it isn\u2019t. If it takes the same number of people to produce a meal as it did 20 years ago but it is twice as delicious, that\u2019s higher productivity. It\u2019s just hard to measure.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When the taps ran dry in S\u00e3o Paulo neighbourhoods during a drought earlier this year, residents took to storing water in pots and tanks in their homes. The resultant surge in the mosquito population led to the tripling in dengue fever cases across Brazil. The 500,000 Brazilians who caught the disease \u2013 the effects of which range from a fever to death \u2013 through mosquito bites in the first three months of the year are but a small fraction of the hundreds of millions infected annually. But some hope for sufferers is at hand courtesy of Oxford-based Oxitec, which plans to fight fire with fire by using genetically-modified mosquitos. The plan involves genetically engineering the male of the mosquito species which carries the dengue virus but loading a \u201cself-limiting\u201d gene which means their offspring would die before reaching adulthood, thus controlling the population. The company is close to earning final regulatory approval from the Brazilian authorities, just over 20 years since Oxitec founder Luke Alphey started working on the idea. Oxitec then aims to roll out the method to tackle other insect problems across the agricultural sector. The World Health Organisation (WHO) quotes research that 390 million people contract dengue fever every year, mostly from the Aedes aegypti mosquito in two broad areas \u2013 from the southern United States to the south of Brazil and from China to Queensland in Australia. Of these, there is estimated to be around 25,000 deaths per year. Alphey\u2019s work has focused on the mosquito and developing a way to control the insect without damaging the surrounding environment, as can happen with pesticides. Males of the species which are genetically engineered with the life-limiting gene are released into the wild and mate with wild females. Only the female mosquito bites and spreads dengue fever. When the genetically modified mosquito mates with a wild female, the offspring carries the piece of DNA which kills them before they become adults. The wild female typically mates only once in her lifetime while the engineered male dies within a week. The method cuts down on the female population, thus limiting the spread of the disease. \u201cIt is exquisitely species specific. These males will only mate with females of the same species and not anything else,\u201d says Alphey, who has been shortlisted for a European Inventor Award next month. \u201cFrom an environmental point of view, it is extremely attractive. It absolutely minimises off-target effects.\u201d Initial trials in the Cayman Islands showed a reduction in the female populationof 90%. The engineered mosquitos are typically released into the wild from a tube in the side of a van and driven into the chosen area. Hadyn Parry, chief executive of Oxitec, says the company will soon start commercialising the dengue product in Brazil before moving on to other countries. Oxitec staff initially will monitor how the mosquitos are released before gradually handing the project over to a body such as a local municipality. The release may take place in phases, says Parry, first to reduce the dengue-carrying mosquito population and then \u2013 for example in the case of an island \u2013 to stop them returning, by focusing new releases around airports and ports. After dengue, Oxitec intends to focus on products to tackle agricultural problems such as the diamondback moth, which feeds on crops such as broccoli in the US, and the olive fly, which affects olive plantations across Spain, Greece and Italy. Just like the dengue mosquito plan, \u201csterile\u201d males would be produced to control the population. The biggest single challenge facing Oxitec, says Parry, is winning over an often sceptical public. He hopes they can, by stressing that unlike insecticides, where the effects of spraying cannot be differentiated, genetic modification is more targeted so that the gene subsequently disappears from the environment. \u201cWhat we see is the vast bulk of people understand what you are doing and are very, very supportive, so in surveys, we get a lot of support. We then get those who don\u2019t understand and need more information and are very conservative and that is absolutely fine. You then get those who are opposed and they tend to be the [anti-] GM crop people and that is the only frustration I find is because what they do is actively put misinformation into the system,\u201d he said. The method of focusing on the dengue-carrying mosquitos is a highly targeted method and therefore environmentally friendly, says Alphey. It is centred on just one of the approximately 3,500 native species of mosquito, of which there may be between 20 and 40 in any particular area. One of the concerns raised by the public is that reducing the population of the mosquitos will haffect the overall ecosystem, he says. In the areas where Oxitec is working, such as in south-east Asia or the Americas, the introduced mosquito in question is not part of the local, native ecosystem. When a species has been recently introduced, it is unlikely that any native species is dependent on them for food, says Oxitec. \u201cMosquitos in aggregate are not major food for anything. Lots will eat them if they find them but only as a small part of their diet. That is mosquitos in aggregate \u2013 this one is a fraction of that,\u201d says Alphey. The company, which employs 50 people, is expected to expand in size in the near future, says Parry, and will likely move \u201crapidly\u201d towards an IPO. What is dengue fever? The WHO says dengue has spread rapidly in recent years and is widespread throughout the tropics. Although the flu-like illness lasts largely for about a week, around 500,000 people with severe dengue are treated in hospital each year. There is no specific treatment for dengue nor is there a vaccine to protect against it. \u2022You can read our archive of The innovators columns here or on the Big Innovation Centre website where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.",

He hopes they can, by stressing that unlike insecticides, where the effects of spraying cannot be differentiated, genetic modification is more targeted so that the gene subsequently disappears from the environment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aeb5f58ffc0597bed2bbc4abf942b7c38702ac3c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/24/1432467659333/2dd91151-16a4-4130-9c90-d7cef51de5b4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A municipal worker fumigates at Madreselva in San Salvador, El Salvador in 2013 after a dengue fever alert.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A municipal worker fumigates at Madreselva in San Salvador, El Salvador in 2013 after a dengue fever alert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Cabezas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat we see is the vast bulk of people understand what you are doing and are very, very supportive, so in surveys, we get a lot of support. We then get those who don\u2019t understand and need more information and are very conservative and that is absolutely fine. You then get those who are opposed and they tend to be the [anti-] GM crop people and that is the only frustration I find is because what they do is actively put misinformation into the system,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The method of focusing on the dengue-carrying mosquitos is a highly targeted method and therefore environmentally friendly, says Alphey. It is centred on just one of the approximately 3,500 native species of mosquito, of which there may be between 20 and 40 in any particular area. </p> <p>One of the concerns raised by the public is that reducing the population of the mosquitos will haffect the overall ecosystem, he says. In the areas where Oxitec is working, such as in south-east Asia or the Americas, the introduced mosquito in question is not part of the local, native ecosystem. When a species has been recently introduced, it is unlikely that any native species is dependent on them for food, says Oxitec.</p> <p>\u201cMosquitos in aggregate are not major food for anything. Lots will eat them if they find them but only as a small part of their diet. That is mosquitos in aggregate \u2013 this one is a fraction of that,\u201d says Alphey.</p> <p>The company, which employs 50 people, is expected to expand in size in the near future, says Parry, and will likely move \u201crapidly\u201d towards an IPO.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a38e2b0d8f6e161e131795f9b9db55f6bc4a2353\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/24/1432467729002/2e37ac14-4c0a-4832-8b3f-2ccf6b4d6093-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Genetically modified male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are released in Piracicaba, Brazil.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Genetically modified male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are released in Piracicaba, Brazil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paulo Whitaker/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What is dengue fever?</h2> <p>The WHO says dengue has spread rapidly in recent years and is widespread throughout the tropics.

      "bodyText": "Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s combative prime minister, is facing yet another week of fraught negotiations as he and his team struggle to agree a shopping list of economic reforms stringent enough to appease the country\u2019s creditors, but different enough from the grinding austerity of the past five years to satisfy the Greek electorate. And all the while, bank deposits will leach out of the country, investment plans will remain on hold and consumers hammered by years of austerity will continue living hand to mouth. Change the actors \u2013 and the stakes \u2013 and it\u2019s a tired plotline familiar to many governments across the world. According to Eurodad, the coalition of civil society groups that campaigns on debt, there have been 600 sovereign debt restructurings since the 1950s \u2013 with many governments, including Argentina for example, experiencing one wrenching write-off after another. Many of these countries plunged deeper into recession as a result of the uncertainty and delay inherent in this bewildering process and the punishing austerity policies inflicted on them, with a resulting collapse in investor and consumer confidence. Argentina defaulted in 2001. Fourteen years later, it is still being pursued through the courts by so-called vulture funds, which buy distressed countries\u2019 debts on the cheap and use every legal device they can to reclaim the money. Yet while the world\u2019s policymakers have expended countless hours since the crisis of 2008 rewriting regulations on bonuses, mortgage lending, derivatives and too-big-to-fail banks, little attention has been paid to what should happen when a government is on the brink of financial meltdown. Sacha Llorenti, the Bolivian ambassador to the UN, is currently touring the world\u2019s capitals trying to change that. \u201cWe\u2019re not just talking about a financial issue; it\u2019s an issue related to growth, to development, to social and economic rights,\u201d he says. The UN is not the obvious forum for discussing debt restructuring: unlike the International Monetary Fund, it is not a lender of last resort with emergency cash to disburse, and doesn\u2019t have a seat around the table when countries have to go to their creditors to ask for help. Yet also unlike the IMF, the UN general assembly is not dominated by the world\u2019s major powers: each member country has one vote. When Argentina tabled a motion calling for the UN to examine the issue of sovereign debt restructuring last autumn, 124 countries voted for it; 11, including the UK and the US, with their powerful financial lobbies, voted against; and there were 41 abstentions. Llorenti, who is chairing the UN \u201cad hoc committee\u201d set up as a result of that vote, says the 11 countries that objected hold 45% of the voting power at the IMF. He believes they would prefer the matter to be tackled there, where they can shape the arguments: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of control, really.\u201d The proposals he is pushing \u2013 drawn up by the UN\u2019s trade and development arm, Unctad \u2013 would create something like a bankruptcy procedure for countries. As a starting point, troubled governments would be given a standstill on repayments \u2013 something Tsipras is having to fight tooth and nail for \u2013 while talks with creditors take place. The aim would be to substantiate every claim on the country, whether from banks, governments or businesses; carry out a thorough sustainability analysis; and impose a debt write-off significant enough to make future repayments manageable and allow the stricken economy to recover. \u201cMoral hazard\u201d is one of the key arguments often used against such an approach: allow reckless borrowers a get-out clause, and you give them an incentive to gorge on cheap debt in the good times. But entering any such \u201cdebt workout\u201d would inevitably come with a hefty dose of political humiliation and stringent conditions attached. US firms don\u2019t tend to enter Chapter 11 lightheartedly: it means admitting they are no longer solvent, and tends to be followed by swingeing cost cuts, as US airlines experienced after 9/11. But after radical surgery, companies can exit Chapter 11 and make a fresh start. At a lively seminar to discuss the proposals in the European parliament earlier this month, Unctad\u2019s Richard Kozul-Wright said: \u201cBankruptcy rules are a key part of any healthy, democratic, free-market economy.\u201d One MEP after another expressed anger and frustration about the damage inflicted on the Greek people by the eurozone\u2019s botched bailouts. Few expect a multilateral system for negotiating sovereign debt workouts to spring up overnight. Llorenti concedes the best he can hope for may be that the UN keeps the issue on the agenda after a fresh vote is held in June. Ultimately, the reviled IMF is likely to be involved in any workable new approach. But perhaps by channelling the anger of Argentina, Greece, Spain, and scores of others, Llorenti can at least keep the subject alive. It will be far too late for Greece. Ultimately, almost everyone believes the stricken country will need a renewed debt write-off. Meanwhile, its creditors are following an all-too-familiar playbook. As Syriza MEP Stelios Kouloglou put it in Brussels: \u201cWe are pretending this is a sustainable solution, which it is not: it\u2019s getting worse and worse.\u201d Instead of the hated troika of the IMF, European Central Bank and Brussels, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re facing another troika, made up of blackmailing, threatening and ultimatums\u201d.",

But its new strategy \u2013 more carry-on baggage, allocated seating, schedule changes to accommodate business travellers \u2013 has given the airline a lift. In its full-year results, due on Tuesday, it is forecast to report a rise in net income from \u20ac523m to around \u20ac865m (\u00a3615m). Analysts expect a number of high profile airports to be added to its route map by next year, with Paris Charles de Gaulle one possibility. Barclays said: \u201cRyanair\u2019s strategic transformation continues to be one of the most impressive we have seen in any airline... [It] is expanding capacity by 7%, with growth focused on Stansted, Dublin and its new primary airport bases (Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece). Aided by a strong pound, we expect Ryanair to give an upbeat view of the summer when it reports, albeit accompanied with highly conservative assumptions for next winter\u2019s yields.\u201d Meanwhile O\u2019Leary continued his new customer-friendly image in a recent French interview by saying Ryanair would cut fares by 10-15% over the next two years, as it passed on the benefits of lower oil prices. Only a pawnbroker in their game Mondaysees what is routinely billed as the richest game in football \u2013 the \u00a3120m battle to gain promotion to the Premier league via the Championship playoff final. A lot will be riding on the outcome for supporters and teams, and for the sponsors of the two clubs concerned. Aviva, backer of Norwich City, probably does not need more publicity, especially with the ubiquity of those awful Paul Whitehouse ads. But Ramsdens, the northern pawnbroker whose brand is on Middlesbrough\u2019s shirts, will no doubt be elated at the prospect of seeing its name blazing from global TV screens next season. After all, knowing where in Stockton-on-Tees to sell, say, a mobile phone or a bit of gold could be very useful to viewers in the Far East. But sponsorship can be a mixed blessing. Newcastle United, with all their existing problems, probably did not want the extra controversy associated with payday lender Wonga. And Zoopla was quick to distance itself from West Bromwich Albion following Nicolas Anelka\u2019s infamous quenelle gesture. So a word of caution to Ramsdens \u2013 be careful what you wish for. Tate ready for a sucralose rush Tate &amp; Lyle unveiled a major restructuring last month, including a plan to close its Singapore sucralose factory and concentrate production of the artificial sweetener in the US. Moving all the business to Alabama seemed to be vindicated when drinks giant PepsiCo subsequently announced it was planning to replace aspartame sweetener in Diet Pepsi with sucralose. Liberum analysts said: \u201cWe believe this could be a positive for Tate &amp; Lyle as we expect they would win the business over commodity Chinese suppliers. A sucralose contract with PepsiCo could further explain Tate\u2019s decision to combine all sucralose production in its Alabama plant as the US is the largest market for Diet Pepsi.\u201d Tate has also decided to sell most of its European bulk ingredients businesses to its joint venture partner, to move away from commodity products to more specialist ingredients, and will receive around \u20ac240m when the deal completes in the summer. Meanwhile the legacy of its old structure will be seen this week when it unveils full-year profits expected to fall from \u00a3322m to around \u00a3200m. Analysts at Canaccord say: \u201cWe believe the cleaner operating structure\u2026 makes a potential acquisition of Tate by [US peer] Bunge, as speculated in the press, easier to accomplish. We had pointed to the joint venture structure in Europe as a possible hurdle complicating the deal; this hurdle has now been removed.\u201d Sweet.",

Aided by a strong pound, we expect Ryanair to give an upbeat view of the summer when it reports, albeit accompanied with highly conservative assumptions for next winter\u2019s yields.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile O\u2019Leary continued his new customer-friendly image in a recent French interview by saying Ryanair would cut fares by 10-15% over the next two years, as it passed on the benefits of lower oil prices.</p> <h2>Only a pawnbroker in their game<br></h2> <p>Mondaysees what is routinely billed as the richest game in football \u2013 the \u00a3120m battle to gain promotion to the Premier league via the Championship playoff final.</p> <p>A lot will be riding on the outcome for supporters and teams, and for the sponsors of the two clubs concerned. Aviva, backer of Norwich City, probably does not need more publicity, especially with the ubiquity of those awful Paul Whitehouse ads. But Ramsdens, the northern pawnbroker whose brand is on Middlesbrough\u2019s shirts, will no doubt be elated at the prospect of seeing its name blazing from global TV screens next season. After all, knowing where in Stockton-on-Tees to sell, say, a mobile phone or a bit of gold could be very useful to viewers in the Far East.</p> <p>But sponsorship can be a mixed blessing. Newcastle United, with all their existing problems, probably did not want the extra controversy associated with payday lender Wonga. And Zoopla was quick to distance itself from West Bromwich Albion following Nicolas Anelka\u2019s infamous <em>quenelle </em>gesture.</p> <p>So a word of caution to Ramsdens \u2013 be careful what you wish for.</p> <h2>Tate ready for a sucralose rush<br></h2> <p>Tate &amp; Lyle unveiled a major restructuring last month, including a plan to close its Singapore sucralose factory and concentrate production of the artificial sweetener in the US.</p> <p>Moving all the business to Alabama seemed to be vindicated when drinks giant PepsiCo subsequently announced it was planning to replace aspartame sweetener in Diet Pepsi with sucralose.</p> <p>Liberum analysts said: \u201cWe believe&#xa0;this could be a positive for Tate&#xa0;&amp; Lyle as we expect they would win the business over commodity Chinese suppliers. A sucralose contract with PepsiCo could further explain Tate\u2019s decision to combine all sucralose production in its Alabama plant as the US is the largest market for Diet Pepsi.\u201d</p> <p>Tate has also decided to sell most of its European bulk ingredients businesses to its joint venture partner, to move away from commodity products to more specialist ingredients, and will receive around \u20ac240m when the deal completes in the summer.</p> <p>Meanwhile the legacy of its old structure will be seen this week when it unveils full-year profits expected to fall from \u00a3322m to around \u00a3200m. Analysts at Canaccord say: \u201cWe believe the cleaner operating structure\u2026 makes a potential acquisition of Tate by [US peer] Bunge, as speculated in the press, easier to accomplish. We had pointed to the joint venture structure in Europe as a possible hurdle complicating the deal; this hurdle has now been removed.\u201d Sweet.</p>",
