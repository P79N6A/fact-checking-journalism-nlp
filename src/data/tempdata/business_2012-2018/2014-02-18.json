One of the star witnesses has been Ireland\u2019s one-time richest man, Sean Quinn, who borrowed billions from the bank to fund a global property portfolio during the Celtic Tiger boom years.

Following objections by defence counsel, the jury was asked to leave the courthouse while legal argument ensued.</p> <p>The judge Mr Martin Nolan ruled that the content of the letter could not given to the jury at this stage but would be shown to them further in the case.</p> <p>Earlier Quilligan told the court that during the credit crunch in 2008 issuing a statement about Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s financial health would not have been an option as it would have frightened investors.</p> <p>Referring to Anglo Irish not publishing its full accounts back then, he said: \u201cYou\u2019d go meet with an investor at the time and they\u2019re hearing these rumours, they might be rattled.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cIf you met them you were almost showing weakness.\u201d</p> <p>Lorcan Staines, a Defence counsel for one of the accused, Patrick Whelan, then said that if the bank had issued the statement it would have been \u201ca little bit like a vote of confidence in a Premier League manager.\u201d</p> <p>The case continues. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-02-18T14:24:44.871Z\">at 2.24pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53036547e4b086afb9810512\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-02-18T14:04:27.766Z\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ba4e765e-3457-4726-a1b7-b8fd6b648825\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/18/1392731542914/4855b186-d68e-4512-ad82-48bbdb88c0d2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Anti-government protesters clash with riot police outside Ukraine's parliament in Kiev.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-government protesters clash with riot police outside Ukraine's parliament in Kiev.

Their arrival comes amid thinly disguised fury in Athens over debt relief talks now being put on the back burner in the wake of Monday\u2019s eurogroup decision to defer negotiations until \u201cafter the summer.\u201d The Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras, who ironically presided over this week\u2019s Ecofin meeting, felt fit to remind his colleagues that \u201ccommitments are commitments\u201d upon hearing of the delay. Regular readers will recall that foreign lenders keeping the Greek economy afloat had promised to deal with the issue of Greece\u2019s unsustainable debt load once Athens had achieved a primary budget surplus \u2013 which it is on course to do. Back to the Anglo Irish trial (see earlier), and news that one witness has been given immunity from prosecution. Henry McDonald, our Ireland Correspondent, writes: Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s former Chief Financial Officer Matt Moran is giving evidence this afternoon in the trial of Sean FitzPatrick, 65, from Greystones in Co Wicklow, 51-year-old Patrick Whelan of Malahide in Dublin and 63-year-old William McAteer of Rathgar in Dublin. The trio are charged with providing illegal financial assistance to 16 individuals and all three have pleaded not guilty to the charges. Moran confirmed to state prosecutor Paul O\u2019Higgins SC that he has been granted immunity from prosecution. O\u2019Higgins stressed to the jury this afternoon that this deal with the state did not imply guilt or otherwise on Moran\u2019s part. The witness was in charge of providing finance at the now defunct bank when it was involved in loans to the so-called Maple 10 - a group of investors the Irish state alleges were illegally granted loans from the bank. The case continues. Here\u2019s more detail of the US housebuilding survey: Over in the US there have been some disappointing New York manufacturing figures earlier, and now a downbeat housing survey. US homebuilder confidence suffered its biggest ever drop in February, hit by the severe winter weather and worries about labour and building costs. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo index dropped from 56 in Janury to 46, the first time since May it was below the 50 level. The industry group\u2019s chairman Kevin Kelly said: Significant weather conditions across most of the country led to a decline in buyer traffic last month. Builders also have additional concerns about meeting ongoing and future demand due to a shortage of lots. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The outcome is much weaker than expectations for a stable outcome at 56. Adverse weather conditions explain most of the decline as construction activity has been badly hit by extremely cold weather. Comments included in today\u2019s NAHB report suggest that further weakness cannot be rule out in the coming months. The news has pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Index around 40 points lower, as dealers returned after the President\u2019s Day holiday. Spain\u2019s economy will continue its crawl out of recession, with the Bank of Spain forecasting growth of 1% for 2013. The forecast, made today by Bank of Spain Governor Luis Maria Linde, compares to an official projection of 0.7%. Other Bank of Spain data showed a jump in the number of bad loans, as consumers and companies struggle to make repayments. Linde cautioned that recovery would be gradual. The most likely recovery in the next few months will be through relatively moderate activity growth. Internal demand will continue to gain weight, though within a very gradual recovery. But could the price of recovery be the mythical siesta and the late-night supper? A campaign group, including a Parliamentary commission, is urging the government to change the country\u2019s timekeeping habits, according to the New York Times. Here is a flavour of the piece, which throws in siestas, Franco and primetime TV schedules. \u201cWe want to see a more efficient culture,\u201d said Ignacio Buqueras, the most outspoken advocate of changing the Spanish schedule. \u201cSpain has to break the bad habits it has accumulated over the past 40 or 50 years.\u201d For the moment, Spain\u2019s government is treating the campaign seriously. In September, a parliamentary commission recommended that the government turn back the clocks an hour and introduce a regular eight-hour workday. As yet, the government has not taken any action. A workday abbreviated by siestas is a Spanish clich\u00e9, yet it is not necessarily rooted in reality. Instead, many urban Spaniards complain of a never-ending workday that begins in the morning but is interrupted by a traditional late-morning break and then interrupted again by the midday lunch. If workers return to their desks at 4 p.m. (lunch starts at 2), many people say, they end up working well into the evening, especially if the boss takes a long break and then works late. \u201cThese working hours are not good for families,\u201d said Paula Del Pino, 37, a lawyer and the mother of two children, who said an 8-to-5 workday would ease the pressure. \u201cSpanish society is still old-fashioned. The ones who rule are old-fashioned, and here, they like it like it is.\u201d Read the full version here. With that I am handing over the blog to Nick Fletcher. Thanks for following so far. The trial of three senior executives who almost bankrupted Ireland is now in its third week. One of the star witnesses has been Ireland\u2019s one-time richest man, Sean Quinn, who borrowed billions from the bank to fund a global property portfolio during the Celtic Tiger boom years. When property prices collapsed across the world, Quinn owed billions and had to file for bankruptcy. Henry McDonald, the Guardian\u2019s Ireland correspondent, has been following the latest from the courtroom. Executives at the bank that almost bankrupted Ireland realised by the autumn of 2007 that ex-billionaire Sean Quinn\u2019s stake in the Anglo Irish Bank had become \u201cpotentially catastrophic,\u201d a Dublin court heard today. The former head of UK operations for the now defunct Anglo Irish Bank revealed that by September 2007 Quinn had taken out loans worth around \u20ac900 million to hold onto a 24% control of shares. Declan Quilligan also admitted that in the same period he did not know the exact worth of assets behind another separate group of investors in the bank known as the Maple 10. He was asked several times by state lawyers if bank executives had checked the value of these investors\u2019 assets even while Anglo Irish Bank was seeking to get them to buy millions of euros worth of shares. Quilligan was giving evidence at the trial of three former Anglo Bank executives - Sean Fitzpatrick, Patrick Whelan and William McAtreet - who are charged with illegally providing finance to 16 individuals including Sean Quinn. All three have pleaded not guilty in courthouse 19 of Dublin\u2019s Central Criminal Court. During cross examination of Quilligan the state lawyer Paul O\u2019Higgins tried to raise the issue of a letter from Ireland\u2019s Financial Regulator with the ex Anglo Irish Bank executive. Following objections by defence counsel, the jury was asked to leave the courthouse while legal argument ensued. The judge Mr Martin Nolan ruled that the content of the letter could not given to the jury at this stage but would be shown to them further in the case. Earlier Quilligan told the court that during the credit crunch in 2008 issuing a statement about Anglo Irish Bank\u2019s financial health would not have been an option as it would have frightened investors. Referring to Anglo Irish not publishing its full accounts back then, he said: \u201cYou\u2019d go meet with an investor at the time and they\u2019re hearing these rumours, they might be rattled.\u201d \u201cIf you met them you were almost showing weakness.\u201d Lorcan Staines, a Defence counsel for one of the accused, Patrick Whelan, then said that if the bank had issued the statement it would have been \u201ca little bit like a vote of confidence in a Premier League manager.\u201d The case continues. Ukrainian dollar bonds have fallen sharply, as clashes between police and anti-government protesters escalated outside the country\u2019s Parliament today. Ukraine\u2019s 2023 dollar bond fell more than 3 points and 2020 bonds lost 0.6% points. Tim Ash at Standard Bank This seems to be the worst spate of violence thus far seen through this conflict. Things seem to be getting out of control.\ufeff Matteo Renzi, Italy\u2019s prime minister designate, has embarked on discussions to form a cabinet, but plenty of high profile candidates have already ruled themselves out. A Reuters Rome correspondent reports that talks have begun between the smaller parties in the current ruling coalition. But the more important talks are expected later in the evening between Renzi, who leads the Democratic Party, and Angelino Alfano, leader of the centre-right NCD party, whose support will be vital to getting a majority in parliament. From Reuters The economy ministry has attracted particular scrutiny and it remains unclear whether Renzi will appoint a politician with experience of running a large department or turn to another technocrat to succeed the outgoing minister, former Bank of Italy official Fabrizio Saccomanni. Lucrezia Reichlin, a highly regarded professor at the London Business School who is in the running to become deputy governor of the Bank of England, has been widely tipped but has so far given no clear signal of her intentions. There was embarrassment on Monday when a radio station made a prank call to Fabrizio Barca, a minister under former Prime Minister Mario Monti who had been seen as a potential candidate but who expressed frustration with the impulsive Renzi. \u201cThere\u2019s no idea at all behind this, there\u2019s such a level of recklessness. Since there are no ideas, we\u2019re just seeing slogans,\u201d Barca told the caller, who was posing as Nichi Vendola, the leader of the small Left Freedom Ecology party. Meanwhile, plenty of foreign observers are taking an interest in the fortunes of Italy\u2019s youngest prime minister since the war. In Brussels, European finance ministers are wrapping up discussions on how to close down problem banks. The discussions are part of efforts to agree a single bank-resolution mechanism for the eurozone. A press conference - streamed here - is getting underway now. Earlier today the Ecofin issued this statement on the EU\u2019s economic performance - a bit like a class of students writing their own end of term report. Basically everything would be fine if everyone paid attention to the stability and growth pact - a line we have heard many times before. WELCOMES the considerable progress made with fiscal consolidation and TAKES NOTE that EU and euro area aggregate debt levels are expected to peak in 2014 and to start decreasing in 2015. The aggregate planned fiscal effort in the EU is envisaged to decline in2014, compared to 1 % on average in 2011-2013. ACKNOWLEDGES that, at the same time, public debt levels in most Member States remain high and continue to increase. Therefore STRESSES that it is crucial for all Member States to stay on course with the agreed growth friendly, differentiated fiscal consolidation strategy in order to ensure the sustainability of public finances, and EMPHASISES that Member States should continue to implement their fiscal policies in line with the Stability and Growth Pact, which allows the automatic stabilizers to work around the agreed path of structural adjustment, while ensuring the long term sustainability of public finances. These policies should be anchored in effective national governance frameworks to enhance confidence. Gold has lost a lot of its glitter for investors, leading to a slump in prices for the precious metal. The latest industry statistics from the World Gold Council show that global demand fell 15% 2013, compared to the previous year. Average annual prices were also down by 15% to $1,411/oz. This was despite a surged in demand for gold jewellery (up17%), bars and coins (up 28%). But investors with gold in their portfolios were selling, with 881 tonnes being dumped on the market. In another telling statistic, China overtook India as the world\u2019s largest market for gold. Chinese demand was up 4% in the final three months of 2013, while Indian consumers bought 16% less gold. The World Gold Council insisted that Indian demand remained strong. It said gold demand remained buoyant, despite import related curbs, noting: We estimate that unofficial imports almost doubled compared with 2012, to compensate for the decline in official imports. Marcus Grubb of the World Gold Council 2013 has been a strong year for gold demand across sectors and geographies, with the exception of western ETF [exchange-traded fund] markets. Specifically, it was the year of the consumer. Although demand has continued its shift from west to east, the growing demand for gold bars, coins and jewellery is a global phenomenon. Here is our inflation story: UK inflation falls below Bank of England\u2019s 2% target The latest slew of ONS data underlines how London house prices are galloping ahead of the rest of the country. UK house prices increased 5.5% in January, although the London effect has skewed the headline figure. Interestingly, prices were least frothy in Scotland, as the country prepares for a referendum vote. London+ 12.3% South East +3.8% England +5.7% Wales 4.8% Scotland 0.5% Northern Ireland 4.8% Ed Conway of Sky News has reproduced this handy chart. The shadow Treasury minister Cathy Jamieson has issued Labour\u2019s response to the latest inflation data: This small fall in the inflation rate is welcome, but with prices still rising much faster than wages the cost-of-living crisis continues. Under David Cameron working people are now on average \u00a31600 a year worse off. Labour\u2019s plan will tackle the cost-of-living crisis and earn our way to higher living standards for the many and not just a few. We will freeze energy bills until 2017, make work pay by expanding free childcare for working parents and get at least 200,000 homes built a year by 2020. We also want to introduce a lower 10p starting rate of tax to help 24 million people on middle and lower incomes. By opposing all these measures and giving a huge tax cut to people earning over \u00a3150,000 David Cameron has shown he\u2019s out of touch and only stands up for a privileged few. Stepping away from UK inflation, some unexpected news in Germany, where investor sentiment has dropped on concerns that the economic recovery in the US could loss steam, as well as currency turbulence in emerging markets. The highly-respected ZEW economic think-tank\u2019s monthly poll of economic sentiment dropped to 55.7 from 61.7 in February falling well short economists\u2019 expectations. It was the lowest reading since November. ZEW president Clemens Fuest said the decline should not be overstated, as most market experts remain optimistic about Europe\u2019s biggest economy. Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg Bank, said the negative factors should remain temporary. Although the ZEW index has a good track record of predicting economic turning points, the latest decline does not point to a change in direction of the economic trajectory yet. The index was based on a survey of 251 analysts and investors and was conducted between Feb. 3 and Feb 17, ZEW said. Here is some more reaction to the inflation data. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, thinks falling inflation will help close the gap between wages and prices. Global inflation trends, particularly those in developed markets, have been falling in the past year and the UK is no exception. The combination of slowing consumer expenditure, discount operations by retailers, quiet energy markets and a strong pound have all helped CPI fall to its lowest level in 51 months. While this one swallow does not make a summer, we would hope to see a trend of lower inflation over the course of 2014. This should allow for the gap between prices and wages to lessen. Howard Archer, chief UK and Europe economist at IHS Global Insight predicts that inflation will stay below 2%, a factor likely to persuade the Bank of England to keep interest rates on hold. We doubt that the Bank of England will raise interest rates until close to mid-2015, despite the markets increasingly expecting a move early next year. Furthermore, when interest rates eventually do start rising, the Bank of England has made it clear the increases will be gradual and limited... We expect inflation to largely hover around 2.0% for an extended period. Given the amount of slack in the economy and consumers\u2019 limited purchasing power, we doubt that underlying price pressures will pick up markedly despite the economy\u2019s improved performance although some retailers and companies may try to boost their margins by lifting prices. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the fall in inflation was good news for businesses and consumers and will strengthen the case that an early rise in interest rates is neither necessary nor likely. An economic environment of low inflation and low interest rates allows people and firms to plan ahead, as they can be confident they will not encounter any unwelcome surprises. The economy still faces many challenges, and every effort must be made to bolster the recovery. But since our current forecast suggests that inflation will remain at around the 2% target, it is now up to the Chancellor to use next month\u2019s Budget to implement measures to boost enterprise and wealth creation. I\u2019ve taken the last quote from the PA. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady reacts to the inflation data: The latest fall in inflation is very welcome but only tells half the story of Britain\u2019s living standards squeeze. Hard-pressed working people need far stronger pay rises before they can really feel the benefit of falling inflation. As it stands, wages are still trailing behind the rising cost of living. So a good news for whisky drinkers and film buffs: as usual the ONS inflation data has a fascinating miscellany of details - full report here. Recreation and culture were one of the main factors bringing prices down, as even ticket and DVDs fell in price in December 2013 and January 2014 by a greater margin than previous months. Food inflation was 0.01% as prices for bread and cereals tumbled. Furniture and carpets also helped push down inflation, recording price falls of 5.1%. Alcoholic drinks, especially whisky, fell in price, with annual inflation of 4.5% compared to 5.8% previously - still well above the headline rate of 1.9% Restaurants and hotels recorded price rises of 2.2%, also slightly down on last time The government reacts to news that inflation has fallen to 1.9% - its lowest level in more than four years. A UK interest rate rise is not likely in the immediate future following the inflation figures, said Annalisa Piazza of Newedge Strategy: The outcome is bang in line with our expectations. Market consensus was for a stable reading at 2%. On the other hand, the expected upswing in core inflation failed to materialize in Jan and core CPI continued its downward trend, dropping to 1.6% from 1.7% the prior month. We notice some moderation across all the major components versus expectations for opposing forces playing different pressures on CPI inflation in January. Clothing prices remained relatively stable on a year on year basis, suggesting this year\u2019s winter sales were in line with 2013\u2019s. The energy-related components were also stable despite both utilities and fuel prices moving lower over the month. As expected, base effects in the miscellaneous component put some limit the downside in the overall index as considerable price decline was registered last year and a similar decline was unlikely to have been repeated this January. The upward pressures coming from base effects were expected to be reflected by the core CPI index but today\u2019s outcome clearly showed that downward core inflationary pressures continued to prevail, mainly led by the communication and households prices that moderated considerably over the month. All in all, today\u2019s CPI statistics confirm the idea the the Bank of England is unlikely to hike rates any time soon despite the improved economic outlook. Here are the Reuters snap headlines on the inflation figures: 18-Feb-2014 09:30 - UK JAN CPI -0.6 PCT MM, 1.9 PCT YY (FORECAST 2.0 PCT YY), LOWEST NOV 2009 18-Feb-2014 09:30 - UK JAN RPI -0.3 PCT MM, 2.8 PCT YY (FORECAST 2.7 PCT YY) 18-Feb-2014 09:30 - UK JAN RPI-X -0.4 PCT MM, 2.8 PCT YY (FORECAST 2.7 PCT YY) 18-Feb-2014 09:30 - UK JAN ALL GOODS 1.4 PCT YY, LOWEST SINCE SEPT 2012; ALL SERVICES 2.4 PCT YY 18-Feb-2014 09:30 - ONS - LARGEST DOWNWARD CONTRIBUTIONS TO YY RATE WERE RECREATION AND CULTURE, FURNITURE, ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO 18-Feb-2014 09:30 - ONS - UK DEC HOUSE PRICES +5.5 PCT YY VS 5.4 PCT IN NOV; LONDON + 12.3 PCT YY DEC - BIGGEST LONDON RISE SINCE AUG 2010 And a breakdown of the sectors courtesy of Ed Conway of Sky: UK inflation falls to 1.9% in January compared to 2% in the previous month, below the Bank of England\u2019s target. Are European carmakers on the road to recovery? The latest figures show that European car manufacturers pulled ahead last month, but are hardly motoring. The European Automobile Manufacturers Association reports that new registrations rose by 5.5% in January, the fifth straight month the figures went up. However, the total of 935,640 vehicles was the second lowest since ACEA began this data series in 2003. Among the major markets, the UK, powered by easy credit and PPI payouts, continued to see some of the highest demand for new cars, with a 7.6% growth, a figure only equalled by Spain. Germany was not far behind, 7.2% growth, followed by Italy at 3.2%. But in France, the home of Renault and Peugeot, demand for new cars was up by 0.5%. Among the smaller countries, a few statistics jump out: The \u2018eurozone crisis\u2019 countries do well: Portugal +32% Greece +14% Ireland +32% So do the Nordics: Sweden+18% Finland +23% But what is going on in the Netherlands and Austria? Netherlands -7% Austria 14% Allan Rushforth, chief operating officer at Hyundai Europe said: European new car sales bottomed out at the beginning of last year and today\u2019s figures show that we\u2019re on the road to recovery. The question is how much of that recovery is organic and how much is the result of actions taken by governments and carmakers. See the full ACEA data here European markets look becalmed at the moment, with investors playing safe ahead of data releases. As well as the ONS statistics on UK inflation at 9.30, data on German economic sentiment is expected at 10 am GMT. The Zew think-tank\u2019s poll of German investor sentiment is expected to rise from 44 from 41.2. Ahead of that here is an early snapshot of the main indices: FTSE100 -0.16% at 6,725 points German Dax +0.04% at 9,660 points France\u2019s CAC 40 -0.03% at 4,333 points Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB +0.26% at 20,507 points Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei index has chalked up its best day since August, closing up 3.13%, after a surprise move by the Bank of Japan to expand its lending. The central bank has expanded two lending programmes, including doubling the size of one that allows banks to borrow money at cheap rates. As expected, the bank also confirmed that its aggressive monetary stimulus programme would remain in place. Here is a flavour of Reuters\u2019 report from Tokyo. As widely expected, the BOJ maintained its pledge of increasing base money, its key monetary policy gauge, at an annual pace of 60-70 trillion yen ($589-$687 billion). The central bank stuck to its assessment that Japan is recovering moderately, a sign it remains confident the world\u2019s third-largest economy can weather the pain from a sales tax increase in April. \u201cThe BOJ already expects the economy to contract immediately after the sales tax hike, so this cannot be the basis for additional easing,\u201d said Hiroaki Muto, senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. The central bank also extended special loan facilities, cobbled together between 2010 and 2012 as a way to drive funds through the banking sector to borrowers, by one year beyond their current expiry date in March. It will double the size of funds available to financial institutions through the various loan facilities in the hope they would boost lending instead of sitting on the pile of cash. Meanwhile, a senior official at the Japanese finance ministry said depreciation of the yen was no longer helping Japan\u2019s exporters. Tatsuo Yamasaki, a director-general at Japan\u2019s finance ministry: The theory that the yen\u2019s depreciation will boost Japanese export volume is no longer true. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Will the Bank of England go below its 2% target for inflation? That is the question as we await data that is expected to show that inflation slowed in January, thanks to discounts in shops and cheaper fuel costs. The consensus among economists is that official figures will reveal a fall in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) to 1.9% last month from 2% in December, the first time inflation has been this low since November 2009. Last month inflation hit the 2% target, while some experts think inflation could fall to 1% later this year, adding to expectations that BoE governor Mark Carney will keep interest rates on hold. The Bank of England\u2019s own forecasts showed CPI falling below target in the first quarter, giving it breathing space to keep rates at record lows of 0.5% for at least a year. Aside from that I\u2019ll be taking a look at the meeting of European finance ministers in Brussels, where the hotly contested financial transactions tax, or Robin Hood tax, is back on the agenda. So which finance minister will play the Sheriff of Nottingham? And with the US back from its long holiday weekend, we are expecting US house price figures for January. I will take a look at Japan\u2019s lending programme and have more on the troika\u2019s decision to return to Greece. The Office for National Statistics inflation data will be published at 9.30.

      "bodyText": "Investors were dipping into riskier assets again as the market moved to a four week high, helped by benign UK inflation figures. But British Gas owner Centrica was under the cosh as political worries continued to unsettle the City ahead of the company's figures on Thursday. Its shares lost 4p to 314.4p as UBS cut its rating from neutral to sell and its price target from 340p to 280p. The bank said: The UK Energy Secretary's letter to Ofgem highlighting areas of energy market concern \u2013 where British Gas' gas retail margin and large market share was the primary focus \u2013 leaves Centrica facing risks from both the opposition Labour party and the coalition government. We see nothing untoward in Centrica's high gas/low electricity pricing structure, but this strategy is likely now unsustainable. We see all Centrica retail margins moving to 4% to reduce political risk (cutting earnings per share by 10%-16%, all else equal). And we still see significant downside risk from political intervention: (1) Labour's tariff freeze plus a possible retail reregulation (earnings per share down a further 13%-15%), or (2) the government restricting retail market share to 20% (-5% earnings per share). Meanwhile Deutsche Bank lowered its target from 315p to 300p with a hold recommendation. Deutsche said: We expect full year results on 20 February to be in line with guidance and Reuters consensus estimates. However, the bigger concern is likely to be the outlook, with all three main divisions facing headwinds. The UK competition assessment in March seems increasingly likely to call for a full Competition Commission review.

It was a \"tragedy for savers\" said data provider Moneyfacts, which noted how the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of rising prices had hit 2.9%, so that savers needed to earn 3.6%, taking tax into account, just to keep up. Savings worth \u00a310,000 five years earlier were worth just \u00a38,846 in real terms. But are we now turning the corner? The CPI has fallen faster than even the optimists anticipated, dropping to 1.9% \u2013 a full percentage point down on seven months ago and the first time in four years it has been below the target set for the Bank of England. Moneyfacts says there are now 84 accounts available to savers that negate the effect of inflation and tax. It's a similar story for wages. Current wage growth at 0.9% (excluding bonuses) remains below the CPI but, with unemployment falling fast, workers should soon be in a strong position to demand pay rises. The economists are predicting that some time in the second half of this year wage growth will finally eclipse inflation \u2013 bringing to an end the near five-year squeeze on household incomes. The more excitable among the economics fraternity are reporting sightings of Goldilocks, last spotted in 2007 \u2013 in the \"Goldilocks\" economy inflation and wage growth are neither too hot nor too cold, and everything tastes just right. But the bears haven't gone away yet and most people are still on cold porridge. Even when wage growth starts to outstrip inflation it will take many years for workers to recover their spending power. Real wages, according to a recent National Institute of Economic and Social Research report, are at 2004 levels, and won't return to their peak until around 2020, especially given Britain's dismal record on productivity. The cost of living crisis is not going away because of one month's good CPI figures. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is adamant that the current recovery is \"neither balanced nor sustainable''. For evidence one need look no further than the property market. The Office for National Statistics said house prices rose 0.9% in December, after rises of 0.5% in November and 1.5% in October, provoking yet more concern about a bubble. With inflation falling, Carney (pictured) won't raise interest rates to deflate the property market, but it can't be long before other levers \u2013 such as stiffer controls over how banks lend \u2013 come into force. Meanwhile, savers aren't exactly rejoicing. Yes, 84 accounts now pay more than CPI after tax \u2013 if you can find them (they're mostly long-term fixes). But that still leaves the nine accounts out of 10 that don't beat inflation \u2013 and as Moneyfacts reports, rates on cash Isas are still falling.",

The OFT investigated the issue after a complaint from the National Union of Students (NUS) and found that about three-quarters of institutions had terms and conditions for students that could stop them graduating or moving to the next year of their course over unpaid non-tuition fee debts. It has written urging them to review such conditions and change them as needed. The OFT says it will work with Universities UK, the representative body for universities, to \"encourage increased awareness and compliance with the law\".

It is particularly concerned that some terms allow the university to impose sanctions on students even when they owe small amounts or a debt is disputed.\" Nisha Arora, from the OFT, said some universities had other approaches to the issue and others needed to change their approach: \"Preventing progression or graduation not only affects students' educational experience but could also significantly harm their future employment prospects and ability to pay off their debts.\" A Universities UK spokesman said the organisation would \"work with the OFT to build a fuller understanding of the concerns they have raised\". He added: \"This will then enable us to raise awareness of the issue and support the OFT in providing guidance to our members.\" The NUS, which took the complaint to the OFT in July last year, said it welcomed the move. It said some universities used such conditions to delay graduation due to such debts as parking or library fines. The NUS's vice president for welfare, Colum McGuire, said: \"I'm delighted to see that the OFT has responded to our complaints and confirmed that this practice is incredibly unfair, which is what NUS has been saying all along. This victory would not have been possible without the support from student officers and advisers in students' unions across the country. \"It's almost laughable that students who are in thousands of pounds of tuition fee debt were having academic sanctions placed on them for money owed for non-academic debt. \"Students who owe money for accommodation, overdue library books or other non-academic debt should certainly pay off the money they owe, but this sanction was disproportionate, and actually made it more difficult for students to repay by restricting access to student support or making it more difficult to secure employment in an already challenging job market. \"Universities that prevent students with accommodation arrears or overdue library fines from obtaining their degree, or enrolling in another year of study, now need to review their policies and put in place more sensible ways of helping students and graduates to pay off any debts.\" The OFT initially contacted 124 Universities UK members to seek copies of their rules over such fines. Of these, 115 replied and about 75% were found to use such a system. The OFT letter is being sent to 164 Universities UK and GuildHE members and some private universities.",

The annual rate of inflation dipped to 1.9% last month from 2% in December, according to the Office for National Statistics, driven lower by prices of furniture and other household goods, alcohol and tobacco, DVDs and tourist attraction entry costs. It was the first time since November 2009 that inflation has fallen below target. Economists said the figures reflected particularly aggressive discounting this year as retailers competed in the January sales. Inflation has been falling steadily in recent months after reaching a peak of 5.2% in September 2011. It finally returned to the 2% target for the first time in four years in December. Economists said inflation was likely to fall further in the coming months, boosting the chance that wage growth will outpace inflation in 2014 for the first time in years, easing the pressure on household budgets. Wage growth was just 0.9% in the latest available data for the three months to November, still less than half the inflation rate. \"There is a good chance that CPI inflation will fall to as low as 1% by the end of this year and remain subdued thereafter,\" said Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics. \"This should enable real earnings to rise for the first year since 2007 and allow the [Bank's] monetary policy committee to keep interest rates on hold until well into next year.\" Despite a backdrop of falling inflation and economic growth, the Bank of England made it clear last week it is in no hurry to raise interest rates \u2013 which have been at an all-time low of 0.5% since March 2009 \u2013 suggesting there would be no rise until after the general election next year. The Bank's governor, Mark Carney, said its policymakers would not take risks with this recovery, which is as yet \"neither balanced nor sustainable\". The retail prices index, historically used to calculate wage rises, rose to 2.8% in January from 2.7% in December, driven higher by insurance, air fares and fuel prices.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British savers could suffer a \u00a33.6bn cut in the value of their savings following the introduction of a financial transaction tax, a study into Brussels plans to raise a levy on City trading has claimed. However, German and Italian households would incur the biggest hit to their savings following the introduction of the FTT, said the report by consultancy London Economics. Savers in Spain and Slovakia would also lose billions should their governments introduce the tax as the impact of the levy drives down the value of their holdings. Under the most draconian version of the FTT that the 11 countries involved could agree, UK savers will suffer a \u20ac4.4bn (\u00a33.6bn) hit, equal to 0.6% of debt and equity holdings, while the German savings market will slump by 14.1%. A light touch tax would reduce German savings by 3.6% and UK savings by 0.1%, the study claimed. The report, which was immediately derided by anti-poverty campaigners, comes ahead of meetings in Brussels to decide the scope of the FTT and how the 11 countries should implement it. The countries are poised to agree terms for implementing the tax, which will add a charge to trades in equity and debt markets, currency transactions and the exotic derivatives that were blamed by many economists for playing a major role in the 2008 banking crash. EU finance ministers gave their approval last year to the FTT in the teeth of dire warnings from the financial services industry of an exodus of funds and despite abstentions by the UK, Luxembourg and the Czech Republic. The levy, which could raise as much as \u20ac35bn a year for the 11 countries, is designed to prevent a repeat of the conditions that stoked the credit crunch by reining in investment banks. According to London Economics, which wrote the report for the City of London Corporation, some savers in the UK and Luxembourg will be hit, but the cost will be small compared with the impact in Germany where 36% of household savings are in traded financial assets such as shares or bonds. The report said savings could lose \u20ac150bn in Germany and \u20ac200bn in Italy once traders factor in the cost of the FTT. It argued that the tax will prove a major discouragement to financial activity in Europe beyond the expected funds raised by the tax and lead to a long-run reduction in savings. The Robin Hood tax campaign, which brings together several anti-poverty charities to promote the FTT, said the report was based on the false premise that most trading by EU banks was in the interests of savers. It said studies of the financial services industry showed most transactions were designed to generate commission and charges for the banks without bringing any benefit to savers. To illustrate the benefits of the levy for savers, the campaign has produced a video starring Bill Nighy and directed by Harry Potter director David Yates. Spokesman David Hillman, said: \"This scaremongering from the Square Mile's PR machine should be taken with an enormous pinch of salt. \"The truth is this tax will hit some of the worst offenders in the City \u2013 the high frequency speculative trades that helped cause the crisis. \"As many experts have shown, given the tax's design, the effects on people's pensions and savings will be negligible. \"It's ironic that it's often the very financial institutions that complain about a tax of 0.1% that charge their clients many times that percentage in fees.\" Bill Nighy, star of Love Actually and Pirates of the Caribbean, said: \"Four years after the launch of the Robin Hood Tax campaign, this tiny tax that could do so much good is on the verge of becoming a reality: France, Germany and nine other European countries are about to introduce it.",
