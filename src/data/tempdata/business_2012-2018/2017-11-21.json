      "bodyText": "Markets have shrugged off a host of uncertainties - the political outlook for Germany, the budget in the UK, the latest Brexit developments, US tax reforms - to end the day in positive territory. The mood was helped by positive US earnings and housing data, which pushed Wall Street to new highs. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 21.88 points or 0.3% at 7411.34 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.83% to 13,167.54 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.48% higher at 5366.15 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB climbed 0.62% to 22,326.44 But Spain\u2019s Ibex bucked the trend, down 0.32% at 9993.4 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.61% to 721.67 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 175 points or 0.74%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. US markets are hitting new highs, helped by positive earnings reports and better than expected housing figures. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Global stocks are on the rise today, with US indices proving the big outperformer on the day amid further improvements to the corporate earnings picture. With gold and the yen rising in the afternoon, there is an interesting risk-off shift coming in play despite the record highs being set across US indices. This afternoon saw the US economic picture improve once more, with existing home sales beating market expectations in October. The 2% rise in US existing home sales comes as the US gets back on its feet in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. US markets have been punching higher in early trade, as they continue to benefit from an earnings season that appears to be the gift that keeps on giving, as home-improvement firm Lowe\u2019s seeing a 6.5% year-on-year jump in sales in the wake of recent hurricane destruction. As for the UK, he said: The recent lack of direction in sterling has been a reflection of the largely sideways trade for the FTSE. However, with a growing feeling that the Tory Brexiteers are increasingly open to improving the divorce settlement offer, the likeliness of a December trade talk kick-off seems to be rising. With the UK budget due out tomorrow, the focus on the UK is likely to remain in place, with a heavily housing based speech from Phillip Hammond expected. Meanwhile some positive developments relating to Greece. Helena Smith writes: The European Commission has given the Greek government the green light today to distribute \u20ac1.4bn worth of social welfare benefits to citizens worst affected by the gruelling austerity measures Athens has been forced to take in return for bailout assistance. Addressing the European parliament\u2019s economic and monetary affairs committee, European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said as Greece had overperformed fiscally, achieving a primary surplus of 1.75 %, its leftist-led government could honour its pledge to hand out a \u201csocial dividend\u201d to those hardest hit by the country\u2019s long economic crisis. The endorsement by Dombrovskis, a one time harsh critic of Greece\u2019s inability to meet fiscal targets, is a 180 degree volte face from the reaction prime minister Alexis Tsipras received when he announced pre-Christmas \u2018gift\u2019 handouts last December. In a televised address that took many by surprise last week, Tsipras said the government had decided to more than double the amount it would distribute in the form of a one-off \u201csocial dividend\u201d this year. Among those entitled to the handout are low-income pensioners and unemployed. With auditors representing international creditors poised to return to Athens, Dombrovskis sounded an upbeat note adding : \u201cThe economy is rebounding.\u201d It was more than feasible, he said, to conclude an ongoing compliance review - the third since the country received a third bailout from eurozone partners and the IMF - by the end of the year or early 2018. In more optimistic news, the Bank of Greece announced that more than 23.5 million tourists visited Greece between January and September this year - up from 21.4% over the same period last year. Revenues came in at around \u20ac13bn - a godsend for Greeks. Back with the UK, and here\u2019s our report on Airbus warning MPs about the possible effects of Brexit: Airbus has told MPs that Britain risks losing the \u201ccrown jewels\u201d of its aviation industry to China as a result of Brexit, putting up to 7,000 wing-manufacturing jobs in Wales at risk. The head of the company\u2019s UK operations warned the business select committee that the threat of new customs bureaucracy and reduced employee mobility could deter long-term investment and accelerate a shift to Asia. Though there are no current plans to move, Katherine Bennett said, adding that she was \u201cfighting to ensure that wing design \u2013 the crown jewels of aerospace \u2013 remains in this country\u201d. \u201cI need to let you know, committee, that other countries would dearly love to design and build wings,\u201d she told MPs. \u201cSome of them already do; we do build wings in China now, and believe you me they are knocking at the door as a result of the situation we are in in this country. The full story is here: And more positive US economic news. Existing home sales rose by more than expected in October, up 2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48m units, helped by a recovery from the disruption caused by recent hurricanes. September\u2019s figure was revised down from 5.39m to 5.37m. Analysts had been expecting a figure of 5.42 for October. The National Association of Realtors, which compiles the figures, said supply shortages were pushing prices higher and making it difficult for first time buyers. The association\u2019s chief economist Lawrence Yun said: Job growth in most of the country continues to carry on at a robust level and is starting to slowly push up wages, which is in turn giving households added assurance that now is a good time to buy a home. While the housing market gained a little more momentum last month, sales are still below year ago levels because low inventory is limiting choices for prospective buyers and keeping price growth elevated. The residual effects on sales from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma are still seen in parts of Texas and Florida. However, sales should completely bounce back to their pre-storm levels by the end of the year, as demand for buying in these areas was very strong before the storms. US markets have made a bright start, with technology stocks moving higher and pushing the Nasdaq Composite to new highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 140 points while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.33% higher and the Nasdaq up 0.46%. Higher oil prices and some relatively positive reports from retailers Urban Outfitters and Dollar Tree. But trading volumes were thin ahead of the forthcoming Thanksgiving break. Here\u2019s a quick summary of the Bank of England hearing at the Treasury Select Committee, from Oxford Economics: Over in the US, and another positive pointer for the country\u2019s economy. The Chicago Fed National Activity index - an average of several indicators of economic activity - rose from 0.36 in September to 0.65 in October, better than the 0.2 figure expected by analysts. The September number was also revised upwards from the initial reading of 0.17. Markets seem unshaken by the various disappointments around. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Despite the unresolved political situation in Germany, a brewing Tory backlash over the Cabinet\u2019s movement on the EU divorce bill, and an unexpected widening of the deficit ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Autumn Budget, things were pretty damn quiet this Tuesday. Investors seemed wary of getting too involved with the forex markets. The pound is flat against the dollar and up 0.1% against the euro, while the euro itself effectively unchanged against the greenback, sporadically dipping 0.1%. This forex flatness has allowed the European indices room to breathe. The DAX is up half a percent, ignoring the issues with the German government (or lack thereof) to hit a fresh 8 day high; the CAC, meanwhile, has risen 0.4%, with the IBEX also climbing 0.2%. Somewhat predictably the FTSE couldn\u2019t muster the same level of energy as its peers, struggling to break 7400 with a meagre 0.1% rise. Looking to the afternoon and the Dow Jones seems set to claw back more of its recent losses, with a 0.2% increase leaving it 20 points away from 23500. There\u2019s not much worthwhile data to contend with \u2013 the existing home sales are expected to rise from 5.39 million to 5.42 million \u2013 meaning the focus will likely remain on any pre-Thanksgiving movement in the Republicans\u2019 tax plans. Here\u2019s our story on the UK budget deficit: Britain\u2019s deficit unexpectedly widened in October, handing Philip Hammond disappointing news on the eve of the budget. Public sector net borrowing last month, excluding the nationalised banks, grew by \u00a3500m to \u00a38bn compared with October a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). City economists expected the deficit, which is the gap between government spending and tax receipts, to improve by \u00a3500m to stand at \u00a37bn. The figures are likely to frustrate the chancellor as he puts the final touches to his budget speech \u2013 due to be delivered at about 12.30pm on Wednesday \u2013 as they point to a weaker picture than thought for the public finances. Hammond is coming under increasing pressure, including from senior Conservative figures, to increase spending amid widespread dissatisfaction with austerity. The full report is here: Time for a quick recap: Budget Eve has got off to a bad start for Philip Hammond, with new figures showing that Britain\u2019s deficit rose last month. The UK borrowed \u00a38bn in October, up from \u00a37.5bn a year ago and almost a billion pounds more than the City expected. The higher borrowing was triggered by a rise in the cost of repaying the UK\u2019s existing debts; the rise in inflation has pushed up the yield on index-linked government bonds. City experts say the figures highlights the dilemma facing Hammond. Tomorrow\u2019s budget may show a rise in borrowing in future years, due to weak productivity. However, borrowing this financial year is still down almost 10%, rather better than forecast in March. Paul Johnson, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, reckons the bad news will come in the budget forecasts: We\u2019ve also seen that the weaker pound is helping British factories. New orders have accelerated at the fastest rate since 1988, with manufacturers seeing a rise in exports. Anna Leach, CBI Head of Economic Intelligence, said: \u201cUK manufacturers are once more performing strongly as global growth and the lower level of sterling continue to support demand. Output growth has picked up again, and export order books match the highest in more than 20 years. \u201cNonetheless, uncertainty continues to hold back investment and cost pressures remain strong. Manufacturers will be hoping the Budget brings some relief from the business rates burden in particular.\u201d Airbus, the aeroplane manufacturer, has warned that Brexit could force its wing design business overseas. Other countries are \u2018knocking on the door\u2019, its UK boss says. The news that Britain\u2019s deficit rose to \u00a38bn last month has disappointed some City traders. Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst at ActivTrades, says the chancellor would have hoped for a drop in borrowing (as economists had indeed expected). This isn\u2019t the news Hammond will have been hoping for the day before the budget, as the deficit has increased to \u00a38.0bn from \u00a37.5bn a year earlier. Despite rises in income and VAT receipts and expectations the deficit would narrow closer to \u00a37.bn, inflation and the effect it has had on debt costs has caused the deficit to widen and suggests Carney was right to start focusing on keeping inflation under control with his historical interest rate rise. William Anderson Jones, head of UK corporate dealing at RationalFX, says sterling hasn\u2019t been hit, though: Higher borrowing costs due to inflation drove the deficit up, although the effect on the pound has been limited. The deficit figures come as analysts await Chancellor Phillip Hammond\u2019s budget tomorrow. Today\u2019s data highlights the challenge Hammond faces, as many analysts expect a call for more spending as the UK\u2019s economic growth weakens. Investors will be watching the pound closely to see how it reacts tomorrow to the budget.\u201d John Hawksworth, PwC chief economist, says Hammond will be pleased that borrowing has dropped during this financial year. But.... The more critical issue for the Budget is how public borrowing will evolve in future years. Lower than expected productivity growth is likely to weigh more heavily in the OBR\u2019s new forecasts tomorrow than the borrowing undershoot this year. \u201cWe do expect the Chancellor to retain a reasonable amount of headroom in meeting his medium-term fiscal target, but he is likely to want to retain most of this as a contingency to deal with any future adverse Brexit-related shocks. While we do expect some giveaways in the Budget on housing, health and some areas of public sector pay, we also expect these to be largely offset by clawbacks in other tax and spending areas.\u201d Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, agrees that the next few years will be tough. Hammond is still on target to beat a target of \u00a358.3 billion for the 2017/18 financial year. Not bad considering the circumstances. This means that this year Hammond actually still has some room for manoeuvre, however looking ahead to the coming years, his challenge looks set to intensify. The ONS is expected to forecast lower levels of growth for the UK in the coming years. For the Chancellor, this means lower tax receipts and therefore less money coming in. Matt Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation also reckons the chancellor\u2019s headroom is shrinking... Over at parliament, the head of Airbus UK has warned MPs that other countries are keen to lure some of its British manufacturing business. Katherine Bennett told the Business, energy and industrial strategy committee that Airbus\u2019s wing design business - its \u201ccrown jewels\u201d \u2013 has won covetous looks from overseas. She also warned that Airbus staff who are EU citizens are very concerned about the future, and whether they\u2019ll be able to work in the UK after Brexit. Airbus employs some 6,000 people at its North Wales plant at Broughton, Flintshire. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Despite the recent surge in orders, UK factory bosses expect growth to slow over the next quarter. A failure to invest in new equipment may be to blame..... Newsflash: UK factories have just reported the biggest jump in new orders since 1988, as the weak pound boosts exports. That\u2019s according to the CBI\u2019s monthly survey of British manufacturing. It found that output rose in the last quarter, with more orders coming in from abroad. Some 28% of manufacturers reported total order books to be above normal, and 11% said they were below normal. That gave a net balance of +17% -- the highest figure since August 1988. The CBI says that orders for food &amp; drink and chemicals rose particularly sharply. Export order books strengthened \u201cnotably\u201d for chemicals, electronics and transport goods. Here\u2019s John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, on today\u2019s public finances: \u201cThese figures are a reminder of the continued failure of both Philip Hammond and Theresa May over these past seven years. The deficit has still not been eliminated as they promised it would be by 2015, and the national debt continues to grow. The rise in the Government\u2019s deficit over October shows once again that seven years of Tory spending cuts have caused pain and misery for millions with little to show for it. \u201cIt further highlights why it is so vital that we see a change of course in the Budget tomorrow, halting the growing emergency in our public services and ending their failed austerity policies. \u201cThe next Labour government will set out a serious plan for the public finances with strategic investment underpinned by our Fiscal Credibility Rule, to help build a high-wage, high-skill economy for the many not the few.\u201d October\u2019s borrowing figures are another sign that the Brexit vote is hurting the UK economy, says Labour MP Chris Leslie. He\u2019s alarmed that rising inflation drove up the cost of servicing the national debt (as explained here). Leslie says it might prompt a rethink about Britain\u2019s exit from the EU: \u201cRather than delivering a huge windfall for public services and our economy, it is clear that Brexit is in fact damaging the public finances. \u201cSoaring inflation resulting from the fall in the value of the pound is resulting in rising debt costs. Our NHS and public services are being starved of vital funding. And the Brexit \u2018war chest\u2019 set aside by the Chancellor in March has now been virtually wiped out. \u201cThe Chancellor is running out of headroom. Nobody voted to be worse off, or for a weaker economy, and as these new facts emerge people are entitled to keep an open mind about whether this is the right course for our country.\u201d Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at the EY Item Club, says the \u201cweakened\u201d October public finances have denied Philip Hammond a boost ahead of Wednesday\u2019s budget. But...he also expects borrowing for the full financial year to be below forecasts. Digging into the public finances, we can see that income tax receipts rose by 6.9% year-on-year in October, and VAT receipts rose by 2.3%. But corporation tax dropped by almost 1% compared with October 2016, and revenue from fuel duty dropped by 2.1%. You can see the dataset here. The full public finances report is online here. Bloomberg describe Britain\u2019s October\u2019s public finances as \u201cdisappointing\u201d, ahead of Wednesday\u2019s budget. However, they still expect borrowing for 2017-18 as a whole to be lower than forecast. The ONS reports that UK government income, and spending, are both higher than a year ago. In the current financial year-to-date, central government received \u00a3394.3bn in income, including \u00a3292.7bn in taxes. This was around 4% more than in the same period in the previous financial year. Over the same period, central government spent \u00a3420.4bn; around 3% more than in the same period in the previous financial year. Of this amount, just below two-thirds was spent by central government departments (such as health, education and defence), around one-third on social benefits (such as pensions, unemployment payments, Child Benefit and Maternity Pay), with the remaining being spent on capital investment and interest on government\u2019s outstanding debt. Ross Campbell, public sector director at accountancy group ICAEW, says Philip Hammond doesn\u2019t have much wriggle room for tomorrow\u2019s budget. Looking at the annual trend, we are still running a large deficit which means our national debt continues to grow. Economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics reckons Britain will borrow less than forecast this financial year, despite the unexpected rise in October\u2019s deficit. As this chart showed, the UK has been expected to borrow \u00a358.3bn this financial year, up from \u00a351.7 in 2016-17. However, the UK has only borrowed \u00a338.5bn since April, some \u00a34bn less than a year ago. Britain\u2019s deficit jumped last month because the cost of repaying existing government debt jumped in October. That\u2019s because some government bonds are linked to inflation, to protect bond-holders from a surge in the cost of living. The retail prices index has hit 4% in October -- as the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote has driven import costs higher. And this is now hitting the public finances, meaning the government has to borrow more (and thus repay more in the future....) As the ONS puts it: In October 2017, the debt interest paid by central government was \u00a36.0 billion, while this represents the highest October interest payment on record it remains less than the highest recorded monthly payment of \u00a37.2 billion in April 2017. This increase in debt interest payment is largely due to the movements in the level of the Retail Prices Index (RPI). Channel 4\u2019s Helia Ebrahimi has tweeted the details: The big picture from today\u2019s public finances is that the UK national debt continues to grow. The Office for National Statistics says: Public sector net debt (excluding public sector banks) was \u00a31,790.4 billion at the end of October 2017, equivalent to 87.2% of gross domestic product (GDP), an increase of \u00a3147.8 billion (or 4.5 percentage points as a ratio of GDP) on October 2016. This is the first time since June that Britain\u2019s monthly deficit has risen year-on-year. This chart shows borrowing this financial year (dark blue) compared to 2016-17 (light blue). So, October\u2019s \u00a38bn deficit has eroded the improvement in the public finances since the spring. The jump in Britain\u2019s deficit to \u00a38bn last month highlights the \u2018headache\u2019 facing chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of Wednesday\u2019s budget, say Reuters. Here\u2019s their first take: Britain\u2019s budget gap unexpectedly widened last month, underscoring finance minister Philip Hammond\u2019s challenge as he juggles calls for more spending in his budget on Wednesday with the prospect of weaker economic growth ahead. The deficit, excluding state-run banks, stood at \u00a38.0bn, up 6.9% compared with October 2016, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday. Rising debt costs, linked to Britain\u2019s higher inflation since the Brexit vote, were a driver of the shortfall. The budget shortfall was bigger than a median forecast of \u00a37.0bn in a Reuters poll of economists. Breaking! Britain\u2019s deficit was bigger than expected last month. The UK borrowed just over \u00a38bn to balance the books in October, up from \u00a37.56bn in October 2016 (that excludes the impact of Britain\u2019s state-owned banks) That\u2019s more than the \u00a37bn which City economists had expected. But despite this rise in borrowing, Britain\u2019s has borrowed less this financial year than a year ago. Public sector net borrowing since the start of this year has now reached \u00a338.5bn, down 9.6% year-on-year. More to follow! In the City, shares in budget airline easyJet have soared to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, after it reported a surge in bookings. EasyJet may be profiting from the collapse of rival Monarch, and Ryanair\u2019s recent pilot shortage. But...catering giant Compass has slumped by up to 5% despite posting an 18% rise in operating profits. The City may be disappointed by an drop in revenue at its offshore business, which cleans and caters at remote oil and gas extraction and mining sites. Global investors seem to have shaken off the German election crisis. Asian stocks hit a 10-year high overnight, with traders citing optimism over the strength of the global economy. European markets have opened calmly this morning too, with the UK, French and German indices broadly flat. The word in the City this morning is that Germany\u2019s economy is strong enough to shrug off the uncertainty of a second election (if it comes to that). But are things too quiet? Nick Leeson, the man who brought Barings Bank down in the 1990s, suspects there may be trouble ahead.... Even if October\u2019s public finances do beat expectations this morning, Britain\u2019s long-term borrowing needs are still worryingly high. Economists at JP Morgan say Philip Hammond will be batting on a \u2018sticky wicket\u2019 tomorrow, as the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (Britain\u2019s fiscal watchdog) may revise down its growth forecasts. That will have a nasty impact on how much tax revenue the government might take in over the coming years. They write: Next week\u2019s budget will be significant for both economic and political reasons. The OBR is set to downgrade its view of potential growth significantly, forcing the Chancellor to pencil in either more borrowing or more austerity\u2014a particular challenge given the domestic political backdrop. The government lacks an overall majority and is under pressure to increase its financial offer ahead of the mid-December EU summit. The Chancellor is also under pressure to use fiscal policy to offer support to key parts of the electorate amid an ongoing real income squeeze, addressing these concerns while ensuring his budget has enough support in Parliament to pass. JP Morgan thus expect Hammond to absorb any growth downgrades by planning to borrow more over the next few years. This chart shows how the UK monthly deficit has fluctuated over the last two years: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s public finances will be in the spotlight today as we learn how much the UK borrowed to balance the books last month. Economists predict that the monthly deficit will hit \u00a37bn, down from around \u00a37.6bn in October 2016. A month ago, September\u2019s deficit came in at just \u00a35.9bn, the lowest in a decade, thanks to a bumper crop of tax takings. Any drop in the October deficit would be welcome news for chancellor Philip Hammond as he puts the finishing touches to tomorrow\u2019s budget. Hammond faces a tricky task, given Britain\u2019s productivity problems, and the looming impact of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. But so far this financial year, the UK has actually borrowed around \u00a36bn less than expected. Finn McLaughlin of Capital Economics expects another decent month\u2019s borrowing figures: We expect the public sector net borrowing requirement measure of borrowing to continue to undershoot the OBR\u2019s forecast, providing some good news ahead of the Chancellor\u2019s Autumn Budget on Wednesday. Indeed, we have pencilled in borrowing of \u00a37.0bn in October, just below last year\u2019s outturn of \u00a37.5bn, leaving cumulative borrowing 7% lower than last year. However, this will probably be overshadowed by downward revisions to the OBR\u2019s forecasts for economic growth and therefore the medium-term outlook for the public finances. Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank thinks Hammond should use any windfall this wisely... Although Brexit uncertainty hangs over the UK\u2019s long-term outlook, the economy continues to hold up well. Healthy tax receipts so far this year will likely lower projected borrowing modestly in the near term. The Chancellor ought to use this boost to finances to make a stronger commitment to budgetary discipline. Unfortunately, the political barriers between Hammond and this sensible route forward are probably too large. Also coming up today.... MPs on the Treasury committee will grill four Bank of England policymakers over the latest inflation report, and their decision to raise interest rates. Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe (who opposed the rate hike) will be accompanied by three external members - Ian McCafferty, Gertjan Vlieghe and Michael Saunders. European investors will be watching German politics closely, after coalition talks floundered on Sunday night. Angela Merkel has hinted that she\u2019d rather go through another general election than lead a minority government. After yesterday\u2019s wobbles, the markets look calm this morning as traders await developments from Berlin. In the City, DIY chain Kingfisher, engineering firm Babcock, food producer Compass and budget airline easyJet are reporting results. The agenda 9.30am GMT: UK public finances for October 10am GMT: Bank of England policymakers Sir Jon Cunliffe, Ian McCafferty, Gertjan Vlieghe and Michael Saunders appear before the Treasury Committee to discuss the Bank\u2019s inflation report 11am GMT: CBI industrial trends report for October.",

The 2% rise in US existing home sales comes as the US gets back on its feet in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. US markets have been punching higher in early trade, as they continue to benefit from an earnings season that appears to be the gift that keeps on giving, as home-improvement firm Lowe\u2019s seeing a 6.5% year-on-year jump in sales in the wake of recent hurricane destruction.</p> </blockquote> <p>As for the UK, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The recent lack of direction in sterling has been a reflection of the largely sideways trade for the FTSE. However, with a growing feeling that the Tory Brexiteers are increasingly open to improving the divorce settlement offer, the likeliness of a December trade talk kick-off seems to be rising.

Lower than expected productivity growth is likely to weigh more heavily in the OBR\u2019s new forecasts tomorrow than the borrowing undershoot this year. </p> <p>\u201cWe do expect the Chancellor to retain a reasonable amount of headroom in meeting his medium-term fiscal target, but he is likely to want to retain most of this as a contingency to deal with any future adverse Brexit-related shocks. While we do expect some giveaways in the Budget on housing, health and some areas of public sector pay, we also expect these to be largely offset by clawbacks in other tax and spending areas.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Fiona Cincotta, </strong>senior market analyst at <strong>City Index, </strong>agrees that the next few years will be tough.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hammond is still on target to beat a target of \u00a358.3 billion for the 2017/18 financial year. Not bad considering the circumstances.</p> <p>This means that this year Hammond actually still has some room for manoeuvre, however looking ahead to the coming years, his challenge looks set to intensify. The ONS is expected to forecast lower levels of growth for the UK in the coming years.

      "bodyText": "Ten of the 12 water companies in the UK have admitted they are still using the practice of water dowsing despite the lack of scientific evidence for its effectiveness. The disclosure has prompted calls for the regulator to stop companies passing the cost of a discredited medieval practice on to their customers. Ofwat said any firm failing to meet its commitments to customers faced a financial penalty. Dowsers, or water witchers, claim that their divining rods cross over when the presence of water is detected below ground. It is regarded as a pseudoscience, after numerous studies showed it was no better than chance at finding water. Some water companies, however, insisted the practice could be as effective as modern methods. The discovery that firms were still using water diviners was made by the science blogger Sally Le Page, after her parents reported seeing an engineer from Severn Trent \u201cwalking around holding two bent tent pegs to locate a pipe\u201d near their home in Stratford-upon-Avon. Le Page asked Severn Trent why it was still using divining rods to find pipes when there was no evidence that it worked. Replying on Twitter, the company said: \u201cWe\u2019ve found that some of the older methods are just as effective than the new ones, but we do use drones as well, and now satellites.\u201d Le Page then asked the other 11 water companies whether they were using water dowsing. Only one, Wessex Water, said it did not use divining rods, and one, Northern Ireland Water had yet to reply. The other nine confirmed the practice was still used in some form in their areas. Christopher Hassall, a specialist in water management at the Leeds University school of biology, said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a technique, it\u2019s witchcraft.\u201d He told the Guardian: \u201cWe work with water companies to enhance the sustainability of drinking water supplies and it is frustrating that there are still some very peculiar practices that are going on in these companies.\u201d He called for Ofwat to eradicate the practice. \u201cThe statutory bodies need to be stepping in. It is analogous to using homeopathy and reiki on the NHS. These are unproven practices that waste time and money. \u201cDrinking water is a fundamental human necessity and something that the water companies should be managing as effectively and efficiently as possible without using these medieval witchcraft practices.\u201d He added: \u201cIf they are going to be passing the charges on to us for using dubious practices, then that\u2019s something everyone in the UK should be concerned about.\u201d Le Page said she was surprised by the finding. \u201cOfwat should be looking into this because it\u2019s a total waste of money. It\u2019s not going to do any harm. But sending out somebody off to a location just to wave some sticks around is not a good use of time or money.\u201d An Ofwat spokesman urged companies to consider the cost-effectiveness of techniques used to stop leaks. He said customers wanted to see a meaningful reduction in leakage and companies were required to agree specific leakage commitments in consultation with clients. \u201cWhile it is ultimately a decision for each individual company how they deliver on those commitments, we expect them all to think very carefully about whether they are using the most efficient and cost-effective tools and resources,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cUltimately, any company which fails to deliver on the commitments it has made to its customers will face a financial penalty.\u201d A spokesman for the sector\u2019s trade body, Water UK, said: \u201cWater companies are spending millions of pounds each year on innovative leakage detection schemes which has helped reduce leakages by a third since the 1990s, and it\u2019s unlikely that a few individuals doing some unofficial divining has had much impact.\u201d Le Page said those convinced by dowsing were being fooled by the \u201cideomotor effect\u201d, a phenomenon observed when the act of thinking about something unconsciously triggers the muscles to move, and in this case, prompts divining rods to cross. \u201cIt so convincing when you do it, and you see the rods cross over, you really don\u2019t realise that you are one the causing it,\u201d she said. Anglia Water was the firm that was most insistent about the effectiveness of dowsing rods, inviting Le Page to a demonstration. The other companies, including Welsh Water, Scottish Water, South West Water, Southern Water and United Utilities, all confirmed the continuing use of some form of dowsing in tweets. Le Page questioned how the methods could still be in use given the evidence available that they did not work. Writing on her blog, she said: \u201cEvery properly conducted scientific test of water dowsing has found it no better than chance (eg here, here, and here, nicely described here). \u201cYou\u2019ll be just as likely to find water by going out and taking a good guess as you will by walking around with divining rods.\u201d",

The company\u2019s senior corporate representative in the UK warned the business select committee that the threat of new customs bureaucracy and reduced employee mobility could deter long-term investment and accelerate a shift to Asia. Though there are no current plans to move, Katherine Bennett said, she was \u201cfighting to ensure that wing design \u2013 the crown jewels of aerospace \u2013 remains in this country\u201d. \u201cI need to let you know, committee, that other countries would dearly love to design and build wings,\u201d she told MPs. \u201cSome of them already do; we do build wings in China now, and believe you me they are knocking at the door as a result of the situation we are in in this country. \u201cEvery single thing we export goes into the EU \u2013 we don\u2019t export anywhere else \u2013 so non-tariff barriers are a really big thing for us,\u201d added Bennet. \u201c[This is] yet another burden going on my shoulder when I am putting a good case for the UK\u201d. The hearing followed written evidence on Monday which saw experts predict new customs obstacles would add \u00a31.5bn a year to the industry\u2019s costs. The Airbus facility at Broughton, North Wales, was the birthplace of such aviation classics as De Havilland\u2019s Comet and Mosquito planes, but now builds up to 60 wings a month for its European parent company. The wings are transported for final assembly in Toulouse, France, in specialised Beluga cargo aircraft that have just a two-hour turnaround between flights, something the company says could be impossible if there is excessive new customs bureaucracy. \u201cThe big issue for us on customs is non-tariff barriers [affecting the] movement of parts across the Channel, of which we have a huge number every single day,\u201d she added. \u201cWith several [Beluga] movements a day. we really don\u2019t need any customs burdens or paperwork getting in the way.\u201d The company, which has established an international working group to handle the impact of Brexit, is also worried about its continued access to key workers once free movement ends. About 600 of the group\u2019s 15,000 UK employees are other EU nationals, while 1,300 of the company\u2019s British employees work on the continent. \u201cIn order to get on in our company you have to have worked in another country,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cThe most important thing is our sites remain competitive and productive \u2026 and I have to say Brexit puts an extra burden on us.\u201d Other witnesses warned that the British space sector was already losing orders as a result of the Brexit referendum, but that there was little chance of new trade deals making a meaningful difference to its export potential. Simon Henley, president-elect of the Royal Aeronautical Society, said some UK space companies have already been excluded from even bidding for work. \u201cEveryone is in a holding pattern at the moment,\u201d said Paul Everitt, chief executive of the industry trade body, ADS. \u201cThere is nothing we can\u2019t access today that will change tomorrow [as a result of new trade deals],\u201d he added. Airbus said it had been speaking to government \u201cseveral times a week\u201d to warn it of the dangers and was \u201claying out issues to the nth degree to every part of government\u201d. But the Department of Exiting the EU has so far refused to publish 58 sectoral analysis reports produced by civil servants into the issues raised by Brexit for different parts of the economy. On Tuesday, campaigners threatened to take ministers to court if they continued to obstruct efforts in parliament to force disclosure. Lawyers representing Molly Scott Cato MEP and Jolyon Maugham, of campaign group the Good Law Project, wrote to David Davis and Philip Hammond giving them 14 days to release in full government studies into the economic impacts of Brexit. If they refuse to make the documents publicly available, they said they will start judicial review proceedings in the high court. \u201cThe government\u2019s desperate desire to hide the reality of Brexit from its own people will not work,\u201d said Maugham. \u201cOur old-fashioned, homegrown common law gives us the right to see these documents \u2013 not just whatever\u2019s left after a minister, desperate for secrecy, has gone at them with a thick black marker pen.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A union is launching a legal challenge over the rights of 75 university support staff to negotiate their pay and conditions, in a landmark case that could improve rights for outsourced workers. The receptionists, security officers, postroom staff and porters working at the University of London are employed through the facilities management company Cordant Security, but are seeking the right to agree their pay and conditions directly with the university. Papers for the case, led by gig economy union the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, and the Good Law Project, devised by the barrister Jolyon Maugham QC, are being filed at the central arbitration committee on Tuesday. The case argues that denying the workers the right to collectively bargain with their \u201cde facto employer\u201d is a breach of article 11 of the European convention on human rights concerning joining trade unions and having them protect their interests. If successful, the case could potentially open the door for thousands of outsourced workers across the UK to negotiate with the company that ultimately benefits from their labour. The union said that if it established the precedent of a joint employer for the purposes of collective bargaining, this could potentially be applied to people employed via agencies, such as those working in the Sports Direct warehouse. The IWGB general secretary, Jason Moyer Lee, said: \u201cWhen it comes to the most important elements of pay and terms and conditions for the outsourced workers, it is the University of London and not Cordant which calls the shots. \u201cIn order for these workers\u2019 collective bargaining and human rights to mean anything, we need to be able to negotiate directly with the university, not the glorified middleman.\u201d A University of London spokesperson said: \u201cThe university does not employ any of these workers and does not accept that the relevant legislation recognises the concept of joint employment. We have therefore not agreed to the IWGB\u2019s request for recognition.\u201d The spokesperson added that the university had begun a review of the performance of its contracted facilities management services, which would cover pay, conditions and benefits. The court case is the latest in a series of battles over better employment rights and pay between outsourced workers, particularly cleaning staff, and universities and other big institutions including hospitals. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said the practice of using outsourced workers hit those in the lowest-paid sectors the hardest. \u201cOutsourcing\u2019s a cheap trick used by bad bosses to dodge their basic responsibilities to workers. They\u2019re trying to hammer down people\u2019s pay and get an unfair advantage,\u201d O\u2019Grady said. \u201cOther European countries have a sensible way of dealing with this. Unions and businesses negotiate fair pay rates for the whole sector, which means outsourcing can\u2019t drive down pay and conditions.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 November 2017. An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to agency workers, rather than outsourced workers. We were also incorrect when we said the case was being launched by the staff; it is being brought by the union.",

    "webTitle": "EasyJet profits plunge despite record passenger numbers", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "EasyJet saw its profits fall 17% last year, with more than \u00a3100m lost due to the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote. The airline reported a record year for passenger numbers, flying 80.2 million people, almost 10% more than in 2015-16, on ever fuller planes. But while revenues exceeded \u00a35bn in 2016-17, fares dipped to fill seats in what the chief executive, Carolyn McCall, said was \u201ca difficult year for the aviation industry\u201d. McCall said: \u201cOur planned approach of achieving number one or two positions at Europe\u2019s leading airports, friendly and efficient customer service and a continuous focus on sustainable cost control, has put easyJet at a strategic advantage during a period when there have been bankruptcies and some airlines have struggled operationally.\u201d Profits before tax fell from \u00a3494m to \u00a3408m. Despite paying a lower dollar price for fuel, the continued weakness of sterling brought additional costs of \u00a3101m, easyJet said. The airline will also be prompted by Brexit to change its rules to ensure easyJet is majority owned and controlled by EU nationals after 2019. About a third of shares are owned by the easyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who has dual UK-Cypriot nationality, and will be classed as EU-owned. But easyJet will ask at its 2018 AGM for new powers to force UK shareholders to sell up if necessary to allow it to continue operating in Europe. McCall said the move was \u201ca technical, administrative thing\u201d and the airline had \u201cno concerns\u201d about getting enough EU shareholders. Shares rose by more than 5% in early trading, on the back of the airline reporting high levels of forward bookings and better revenue so far in its 2017-18 financial year, which it said was \u201cprimarily as a result of some capacity leaving the market\u201d. The collapse of Monarch, plus the decision by Ryanair to cancel thousands of flights, has reduced competition in the low-cost sector for this autumn and winter. McCall said there was \u201cpositive momentum\u201d including rising ancillary revenues, driven by high sales on the mobile app, as well better inflight brands. EasyJet expects to increase its capacity by another 6% next year, before the expected addition of Air Berlin slots. The company last month announced it would acquire part of the German airline\u2019s operations at Berlin Tegel airport, including leases for up to 25 A320 aircraft and taking on up to 1,000 crew in a \u00a340m deal. The airline said it would expect a further \u00a360m costs before it turns around the loss-making operation but would see a profit by 2019. The airline said it would pay dividends of 40.9p per share in March, a windfall of about \u00a355m for the biggest shareholder, Haji-Ioannou. McCall is leaving easyJet at the end of November to run broadcaster ITV, and will be replaced as chief executive by Johan Lundgren, previously deputy chief executive of Tui Group. The newcomer will earn a basic salary 5% higher than McCall\u2019s at \u00a3740,000 \u2013 raising further questions about the gender pay gap. McCall said it was a question for the board: \u201cI don\u2019t set the salary for the successor. The board has to set the right salary.\u201d She said she was proud to have increased customer loyalty at easyJet during her seven years in charge. \u201cOur customers don\u2019t see the low-cost model \u2013 we have got enormous loyalty from passengers, 60 million last year were repeat customers. That\u2019s testimony to our crew and people.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Despite paying a lower dollar price for fuel, the continued weakness of sterling brought additional costs of \u00a3101m, easyJet said. </p> <p>The airline will also be prompted by Brexit to change its rules to ensure easyJet is majority owned and controlled by EU nationals after 2019. </p> <p>About a third of shares are owned by the easyJet founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who has dual UK-Cypriot nationality, and will be classed as EU-owned. But easyJet will ask at its 2018 AGM for new powers to force UK shareholders to sell up if necessary to allow it to continue operating in Europe. McCall said the move was \u201ca technical, administrative thing\u201d and the airline had \u201cno concerns\u201d about getting enough EU shareholders.</p> <p>Shares rose by more than 5% in early trading, on the back of the airline reporting high levels of forward bookings and better revenue so far in its 2017-18 financial year, which it said was \u201cprimarily as a result of some capacity leaving the market\u201d. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/03/monarch-collapse-government-cut-cost-repatriation\">collapse of Monarch</a>, plus the decision by Ryanair to cancel thousands of flights, has reduced competition in the low-cost sector for this autumn and winter.</p> <p>McCall said there was \u201cpositive momentum\u201d including rising ancillary revenues, driven by high sales on the mobile app, as well better inflight brands. </p> <p>EasyJet expects to increase its capacity by another 6% next year, before the expected addition of Air Berlin slots. </p> <p>The company last month announced it would acquire part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/15/easyjet-air-berlin-adminstration-lufthansa-etihad\">German airline\u2019s</a> operations at Berlin Tegel airport, including leases for up to 25 A320 aircraft and taking on up to 1,000 crew in a \u00a340m deal. The airline said it would expect a further \u00a360m costs before it turns around the loss-making operation but would see a profit by 2019.</p> <p>The airline said it would pay dividends of 40.9p per share in March, a windfall of about \u00a355m for the biggest shareholder, Haji-Ioannou. </p> <p>McCall is leaving easyJet at the end of November to run broadcaster ITV, and will be replaced as chief executive by Johan Lundgren, previously deputy chief executive of Tui Group. </p> <p>The newcomer will earn a basic salary 5% higher than McCall\u2019s at \u00a3740,000 \u2013 raising further questions about the gender pay gap. McCall said it was a question for the board: \u201cI don\u2019t set the salary for the successor. The board has to set the right salary.\u201d <br></p> <p>She said she was proud to have increased customer loyalty at easyJet during her seven years in charge. \u201cOur customers don\u2019t see the low-cost model \u2013 we have got enormous loyalty from passengers, 60 million last year were repeat customers.

      "bodyText": "Concordia International, the Canadian drug company, has overcharged the NHS by more than \u00a3100m in the past decade for a life-changing thyroid drug, according to Britain\u2019s competition watchdog. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had provisionally found that Concordia had \u201cabused its dominant position to overcharge the NHS\u201d by hiking the price of liothyronine, used to treat patients with an underactive thyroid, by nearly 6,000% between 2007 and 2017. The regulator said the NHS had spent more than \u00a334m on the drug last year, up from about \u00a3600,000 in 2006. The amount it paid per pack rose from \u00a34.46 in 2007 to \u00a3258.19 by July 2017. The price of a single pill went up from 16p to \u00a39.22, even though production costs remained broadly stable during that period, the CMA said. Concordia could be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual turnover. Liothyronine tablets are used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition caused by a deficiency of the thyroid hormone that affects at least two in 100 people and can lead to depression, tiredness and weight gain. For many patients there is no alternative and, until this year, Concordia was the only supplier. This summer, the UK firm Morningside Healthcare and Israel\u2019s Teva were granted licences to supply the drug. The medicine, a synthetic version of the hormone T3, is taken by patients who do not respond well to the cheaper alternative, levothyroxine. It is sold across Europe for a few cents per pill. The CMA chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said: \u201cPharmaceutical companies which abuse their position and overcharge for drugs are forcing the NHS \u2013 and the UK taxpayer \u2013 to pay over the odds for important medical treatments. \u201cWe allege that Concordia used its market dominance in the supply of liothyronine tablets to do exactly that. \u201cAt this stage in the investigation, our findings are provisional and there has been no definitive decision that there has been a breach of competition law. We will carefully consider any representations from the companies before deciding whether the law has in fact been broken.\u201d Concordia and the private equity firms Cinven and HgCapital, the previous owners of Amdipharm Mercury which was acquired by Concordia in 2015, have been asked to respond to the findings. Concordia said it would review the findings, but added: \u201cWe do not believe that competition law has been infringed. The pricing of liothyronine has been conducted openly and transparently with the Department of Health in the UK over a period of 10 years. \u201cOver that time, significant investment has been made in this medicine to ensure its continued availability for patients in the UK, to the specifications required by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK.\u201d The British Thyroid Foundation said: \u201cThere are many thyroid patients who have told us that this medicine makes a huge difference to their lives and the enormous price rise has caused significant confusion and distress. \u201cWe look forward to the CMA\u2019s final decision and very much hope that it will lead to an improvement in care for patients with hypothyroidism.\u201d The drug industry body said it \u201cdoes not in any way support or condone any deliberate \u2018price hikes\u2019 by pharmaceutical companies\u201d. Mike Thompson, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: \u201cWe fully support the CMA in taking action in cases of proven abuse of market power. We also continue to support the government in taking policy steps to ensure such abuses cannot happen in the future. \u201cThis case is yet to conclude, but we do not \u2013 and will not \u2013 support any company found to have intentionally exploited the NHS.\u201d In a consultation paper published in July, NHS England recommended that health trusts should not prescribe the pill for new patients. It said it was clinically effective but there were cheaper alternatives. Concordia is the subject of a further CMA investigation. The regulator said in March in a provisional finding that the Canadian firm had made illegal deals with its rival Actavis UK to inflate the price of life-saving hydrocortisone tablets in Britain. Last year, the CMA fined the US pharma giant Pfizer and drug distributor Flynn Pharma nearly \u00a390m \u2013 including a record \u00a384m penalty for Pfizer \u2013 after they increased the price charged to the NHS for an anti-epilepsy drug by up to 2,600%. Britain\u2019s biggest drugmaker, GlaxoSmithKline, and two other firms were fined \u00a345m over the antidepressant paroxetine. Both decisions are under appeal. The CMA is carrying out seven other investigations in relation to drug pricing and competition issues. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US Department of Justice on Monday moved to block AT&amp;T\u2019s $85bn takeover of Time Warner, one of the largest media deals ever announced. The decision to file suit against the deal is likely to set off a high stakes court battle \u2013 AT&amp;T has already signaled it will go to court if the deal is blocked \u2013 and will start one of the biggest corporate merger legal battles in decades. The suit argues the deal will \u201csubstantially lessen competition, resulting in higher prices and less innovation for millions of Americans\u201d. \u201cThis merger would greatly harm American consumers. It would mean higher monthly television bills and fewer of the new, emerging innovative options that consumers are beginning to enjoy,\u201d said assistant attorney general Makan Delrahim of the department\u2019s antitrust division. David McAtee, AT&amp;T\u2019s general counsel called the suit \u201ca radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrust precedent\u201d. The US authorities had already called for major changes before signing off on any deal. Critics have claimed the deal is being held hostage because of Donald Trump\u2019s antipathy towards CNN, owned by Time Warner and which he has branded as \u201cfake news\u201d. The deal was first announced in October 2016, just weeks before the presidential election. During the campaign, and since his election, Trump has regularly attacked CNN, calling the network \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d at his first press conference after the election. Trump attacked the network again while on his recent tour of Asia, calling it \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cFAKE\u201d. Reports suggested that AT&amp;T, the world\u2019s largest telecommunications company, had offered to sell CNN in order for a deal to go through. But the chief executive officer, Randall Stephenson, denied any such compromise had been offered. \u201cThroughout this process, I have never offered to sell CNN and have no intention of doing so,\u201d he said in a statement earlier this month. In a press conference after the news broke Stephenson acknowledged the speculation that Trump\u2019s antipathy to CNN had sparked the legal move. \u201cFrankly I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut nobody should be surprised that the question keeps coming up.\u201d Stephenson said the deal had \u201cthe whole world\u201d questioning what the justice department \u201ccan and cannot do\u201d. He said any deal would protect CNN\u2019s \u201cfirst amendment rights\u201d and no deal would be struck without the news channel. Time Warner, owner of CNN, HBO, Warner Brothers and other big-name media properties, does not compete directly with AT&amp;T meaning there is little argument against the deal on competition grounds. But the justice department argues that combining Time Warner\u2019s assets with AT&amp;T and its DirecTV satellite television business would directly harm consumers, quoting statements from DirecTV that so-called \u201cvertically integrated programmers\u201d \u2013 which own the means of distribution as well as the content \u2013 can \u201cmuch more credibly threaten to withhold programming from rival [distributors]\u201d and can \u201cuse such threats to demand higher prices and more favorable terms\u201d. \u201cVertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitor from the market. We see no legitimate reason for our merger to be treated differently,\u201d said McAtee. \u201cFortunately, the Department of Justice doesn\u2019t have the final say in this matter. Rather, it bears the burden of proving to the US district court that the transaction violates the law. We are confident that the court will reject the government\u2019s claims and permit this merger under longstanding legal precedent.\u201d The deal comes as tech giants Amazon, Apple, Google and Netflix are increasingly challenging traditional media players and competing for their audiences. But the deal would hand some of the most powerful brands in media to the largest player in telecom. Comcast, the US\u2019s largest broadband provider, took over NBC Universal, owner of the NBC network and Universal Studios in 2009 and that deal has been roundly criticised by senators who believe Comcast has used its cable dominance to quash competition. Stephenson has argued that it \u201cborders on comical\u201d to suggest AT&amp;T would be too powerful after a merger. The Writers Guild of America West welcomed the news. \u201cAs we have stated since this deal was first proposed, the size, scope and potential harm to both consumers and content creators provide ample reason to block the merger on its merits. \u201cThe proposed combination of must-have content with vast control over distribution would give the company broad power to undermine competition, restrict access to programming and raise prices,\u201d the guild said in a statement. \u201cWith reports surfacing each week of other possible media mergers, blocking this deal has only become more critical.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

It would mean higher monthly television bills and fewer of the new, emerging innovative options that consumers are beginning to enjoy,\u201d said assistant attorney general Makan Delrahim of the department\u2019s antitrust division.</p> <p>David McAtee, AT&amp;T\u2019s general counsel called the suit \u201ca radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrust precedent\u201d.</p> <p>The US authorities had already called for major changes before signing off on any deal. Critics have claimed the deal is being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/08/trump-att-time-warner-takeover-threaten-deal\">held hostage</a> because of Donald Trump\u2019s antipathy towards CNN, owned by Time Warner and which he has branded as \u201cfake news\u201d.</p> <p>The deal was first announced in October 2016, just weeks before the presidential election. During the campaign, and since his election, Trump has regularly attacked CNN, calling the network \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d at his first press conference after the election.</p> <p>Trump attacked the network again while on his recent tour of Asia, calling it \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cFAKE\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/930748627642998784\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">While in the Philippines I was forced to watch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CNN</a>, which I have not done in months, and again realized how bad, and FAKE, it is.

But the chief executive officer, Randall Stephenson, denied any such compromise had been offered. \u201cThroughout this process, I have never offered to sell CNN and have no intention of doing so,\u201d he said in a statement earlier this month.</p> <p>In a press conference after the news broke Stephenson acknowledged the speculation that Trump\u2019s antipathy to CNN had sparked the legal move. \u201cFrankly I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut nobody should be surprised that the question keeps coming up.\u201d</p> <p>Stephenson said the deal had \u201cthe whole world\u201d questioning what the justice department \u201ccan and cannot do\u201d.</p> <p>He said any deal would protect CNN\u2019s \u201cfirst amendment rights\u201d and no deal would be struck without the news channel.</p> <p>Time Warner, owner of CNN, HBO, Warner Brothers and other big-name media properties, does not compete directly with AT&amp;T meaning there is little argument against the deal on competition grounds.<br></p> <p>But the justice department argues that combining Time Warner\u2019s assets with AT&amp;T and its DirecTV satellite television business would directly harm consumers, quoting statements from DirecTV that so-called \u201cvertically integrated programmers\u201d \u2013 which own the means of distribution as well as the content \u2013 can \u201cmuch more credibly threaten to withhold programming from rival [distributors]\u201d and can \u201cuse such threats to demand higher prices and more favorable terms\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cVertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitor from the market. We see no legitimate reason for our merger to be treated differently,\u201d said McAtee.</p> <p>\u201cFortunately, the Department of Justice doesn\u2019t have the final say in this matter. Rather, it bears the burden of proving to the US district court that the transaction violates the law. We are confident that the court will reject the government\u2019s claims and permit this merger under longstanding legal precedent.\u201d</p> <p>The deal comes as tech giants Amazon, Apple, Google and Netflix are increasingly challenging traditional media players and competing for their audiences.</p> <p>But the deal would hand some of the most powerful brands in media to the largest player in telecom. Comcast, the US\u2019s largest broadband provider, took over NBC Universal, owner of the NBC network and Universal Studios in 2009 and that deal has been roundly criticised by senators who believe Comcast has used its cable dominance to quash competition.</p> <p>Stephenson has argued that it <a href=\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2017/11/09/at-t-ceo-have-never-been-told-price-getting-deal-done-was-selling-cnn.html\">\u201cborders on comical\u201d</a> to suggest AT&amp;T would be too powerful after a merger.<br></p> <p>The Writers Guild of America West welcomed the news. \u201cAs we have stated since this deal was first proposed, the size, scope and potential harm to both consumers and content creators provide ample reason to block the merger on its merits.</p> <p>\u201cThe proposed combination of must-have content with vast control over distribution would give the company broad power to undermine competition, restrict access to programming and raise prices,\u201d the guild said in a statement. \u201cWith reports surfacing each week of other possible media mergers, blocking this deal has only become more critical.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.</p>",

In a boost to the chancellor on the eve of the budget, the CBI\u2019s monthly health check of industry showed a sharp improvement in both total and export order books. The employers\u2019 organisation said the climate for order books had not been better since August 1988 \u2013 when the boom of the late 1980s peaked. Food and drink firms and companies producing chemicals have experienced a particularly marked increase in demand. Export order books \u2013 which have been helped by the fall in the value of sterling since the EU referendum in June 2016 \u2013 were the strongest since June 1995. The pickup in external demand has been led by the chemicals, electronics and transport sectors. The CBI said strong order books had resulted in higher factory output, with firms confident that growth would continue over the coming three months. Firms were still facing price pressures, but the CBI said these were not as pronounced as they had been earlier in the year, when the 15% drop in sterling was pushing up the cost of imported fuel and raw materials. Although manufacturing accounts for only 10% of the economy, the strength of the CBI survey will boost the chances of UK growth picking up from its modest pace of expansion in the first nine months of 2017. Anna Leach, the CBI\u2019s head of economic intelligence, said: \u201cUK manufacturers are once more performing strongly as global growth and the lower level of sterling continue to support demand. Output growth has picked up again, and export order books match the highest in more than 20 years. \u201cNonetheless, uncertainty continues to hold back investment and cost pressures remain strong.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s deficit unexpectedly widened in October, handing Philip Hammond disappointing news on the eve of the budget. Public sector net borrowing last month, excluding the nationalised banks, grew by \u00a3500m to \u00a38bn compared with October a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). City economists expected the deficit, which is the gap between government spending and tax receipts, to improve by \u00a3500m to stand at \u00a37bn. The figures are likely to frustrate the chancellor as he puts the final touches to his budget speech \u2013 due to be delivered at about 12.30pm on Wednesday \u2013 as they point to a weaker picture than thought for the public finances. Hammond is coming under increasing pressure, including from senior Conservative figures, to increase spending amid widespread dissatisfaction with austerity. The chancellor is also expected to see his room for manoeuvre drastically reduced on Wednesday by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s economic forecaster, which is expected to downgrade the outlook for the public finances due to weaker levels of productivity. Lower expectations for the output per worker will have an impact on the gross domestic product, cutting the amount of economic output available for taxation. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons the downgrade will contribute to a \u00a320bn black hole in the public finances, limiting Hammond\u2019s spending power if he wants to stick to his pledge to remove the deficit by the mid-2020s. John McDonnell, the Labour shadow chancellor, seized on the October data to argue that seven years of spending cuts had \u201ccaused pain and misery for millions with little to show for it\u201d. \u201cIt further highlights why it is so vital that we see a change of course in the budget tomorrow, halting the growing emergency in our public services and ending their failed austerity policies,\u201d he added. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cWednesday\u2019s budget is not going to be easy for the chancellor \u2026 he now faces larger deficits over the medium-term due to the OBR downgrading its productivity growth forecasts for the UK and he has to square the circle.\u201d The unexpected increase in the deficit last month was fuelled by higher debt interest payments on government bonds due to rising inflation. Some gilts, which are bonds sold by the government to investors for financing the running of the country, are linked to the retail price index (RPI) measure of inflation. The depreciation in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote a year ago has caused inflation to soar, with the RPI hitting 4% in October \u2013 the highest level since December 2011. The government paid \u00a36bn in debt interest last month, which was the highest amount for any October on record, although it fell short of the biggest-ever monthly payment of \u00a37.2bn, which came in April 2017. Despite the deterioration last month, public finances have generally improved. Hammond is likely to seize on the borrowing figure for the year so far, which the ONS said was the smallest deficit since 2007. The deficit in the first seven months of 2017, since the financial year began in April, fell by \u00a34.1bn to \u00a338.5bn compared with the same period in 2016. The lower levels of borrowing mean the chancellor is likely to undershoot the OBR\u2019s March forecast for \u00a358.3bn of borrowing during the financial year ending March 2018. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "UK consumers could be hit by a new bout of food price inflation next year after the return of the La Ni\u00f1a global weather phenomenon, which may hit production of key commodities including coffee and cocoa. The UK is expected to be particularly exposed to the effect of the event, which tends to prompt dry weather in the US midwest and heavy rainfall in south-east Asia and Australia, because of the uncertainty caused by Brexit. Stefan Vogel, head of agri commodity markets at Rabobank, predicted a \u201cyear of anxiety for UK farmers and consumers\u201d. Vogel said: \u201cWe see significant threats on the horizon to global food prices in 2018, which have been relatively stable or even trending lower for a number of years. \u201cChief among them is the potential of La Ni\u00f1a, a weather event caused by the cooling of the tropical Pacific Ocean that could affect areas ranging from grain fields in the Americas to palm oil plantations in Asia. \u201cUnfortunately, the current high-inflation environment in the UK makes it disproportionately exposed to any significant movement in food prices, while the uncertainty over trade deals when Britain leaves the EU exacerbates the situation further.\u201d According to the US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the chance of La Ni\u00f1a conditions strengthening and lasting over the northern hemisphere winter is currently between 65% and 75%. The UK\u2019s Met Office has also warned of an \u201cincreasing risk\u201d of a La Nina event this winter, bringing a cold snap to the UK. It says it is unlikely there will be a major La Ni\u00f1a event, as experienced between 2010 and 2012, when severe droughts in key growing areas including the US midwest devastated crops while excessive rains in Columbia led to the spreading of a deadly coffee fungus. In its outlook report for 2018, Good Buy, Low Prices, Rabobank\u2019s analysts predict that La Ni\u00f1a is likely to prompt volatile prices for commodities \u2013 ranging from palm oil in south-east Asia, where above-average rainfall and isolated flooding can take place, to crops in parts of Argentina, Peru, southern Brazil and the US that might be affected by drought or low rainfall. Jara Zicha, a commodities analyst at Mintec, said the effects of a La Ni\u00f1a and its stronger brother El Ni\u00f1o were hard to predict. A change in the weather could also be beneficial to some crops. Two years ago, one of the strongest El Ni\u00f1os on record brought rain to drought-stricken California helping fruit and nut farmers in the region, for example. \u201cWhat is important is how strong La Ni\u00f1a is,\u201d Zicha said. But he added: \u201cThis just adds another level of uncertainty. The UK already has very weak sterling making prices expensive and we are slowly starting to see those now. Going forward, Brexit is another uncertainty and La Nina is another factor the UK has to deal with.\u201d Rising crude oil prices and global freight costs as well as the potential imposition of new tariffs on the import of goods once the UK leaves the EU, could all add to price rises according to Rabobank. Further price rises would come on top of increases in the price of fish, fats and vegetables which have driven food price inflation to the highest level in more than four years. City analysts and some retailers had predicted that the big drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June 2016 would cease to have a strong upward effect on prices by the end of this year. But Rabobank\u2019s analysts suggest otherwise. \u201cAlongside weather, the rising cost of global trade and potential currency fluctuations also create upside risks for food prices,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cOur view is these outweigh the downside risks in 2018. Food and agribusinesses must therefore plan ahead to manage these risks proactively and appropriately.\u201d \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",
