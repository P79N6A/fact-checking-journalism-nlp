      "bodyText": "The Irish premier, Enda Kenny, thanked the Irish people on Sunday night for putting up with three years of IMF-EU imposed austerity but warned that prudent budgets would continue under his administration. In a live address to mark the Republic's departure from the IMF-EU multi-billion euro bailout programme this weekend, the Taoiseach said that \"we must continue to pursue prudent budgetary policies\". Kenny said that under the bailout programme \"many families have also had to face the devastating consequences of unemployment and emigration\". He said that thanks to the efforts of ordinary people the country was able to exit the programme. \"I thank you for the part that you have played in Ireland's recovery to date,\" he said in his television address on RTE One. Kenny said that the Fine Gael-Labour coalition would publish a medium-term economic plan later this week to generate more jobs. \"The creation of jobs will be at the heart of the plan \u2026 by increasing total employment to over 2 million people by 2020, we can replace all of the jobs that were lost,\" he said. Kenny said: \"Throughout our history, the Irish people have already shown that nothing is impossible for us to achieve, when we really apply ourselves to a challenge or course.\" On the credit-fuelled boom in property that caused the crash, particularly in the Irish banking sector, the Taoiseach added: \"We are never going back to that culture.\" The Republic received more than \u20ac67bn (\u00a356.5bn) from the IMF and the EU to rescue the state from bankruptcy after the Celtic Tiger economy collapsed. In return the country had to endure cuts of billions of euros to social welfare, public sector wages and pensions, and the scrapping of many capital spending projects. Under the programme the coallition government has to raise an extra \u20ac5.3bn in taxes and reduce public spending by \u20ac9.6bn. With Ireland becoming the first eurozone country to exit the bailout programme, Kenny is expected to acknowledge the sacrifices that the Irish people have made over the past three years. Over the weekend his ministers have been lining up to depict the Irish people as the \"heroes and heroines\" of the crisis. Kenny's finance minister, Michael Noonan, has warned that there is still a \"tough road ahead\" for the Republic despite the exit from the bailout. Noonan said, however, that leaving the programme would create \"a change in perspective\" towards Ireland around the world, particularly in the international money markets. He also predicted that the next estimate of Ireland's standing by ratings agency Moody's next month would be more favourable. Before the banking crash of 2008, Ireland had near full employment but was gorging on credit and fuelling in turn a massively overheated property boom. By the time the IMF and EU came into Ireland to bail the nation out, unemployment had soared to 15%.",

    "webTitle": "Jack Monroe to front Sainsbury's ad campaign", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Celebrity chefs are off the menu for a supermarket which has chosen one of the faces of austerity Britain as its new advertising star. Jack Monroe, a 25-year-old single mother whose stories of struggling to feed her son for \u00a310 a week while on benefits have propelled her to national fame, will front Sainsbury's new campaign from next month. Two years after terminating its relationship with another Essex-born foodie, Jamie Oliver, the retailer has hired Monroe as one of four \"real\" food lovers whose commitment to food on a budget and work in their local communities has impressed the bosses at Britain's third largest supermarket. The six-week TV and print campaign, called \"Love your Roast\", will feature each of the bloggers creating recipes focusing on a leftover joint of meat \u2013 in Monroe's case, half a free-range chicken. Monroe said she was thrilled to have been approached by Sainsbury's for her first commercial collaboration, after turning down a succession of other offers from its high street rivals, understood to have included the middle-class magnet Waitrose. \"Sainsbury's is where I've always shopped as it's at the end of my road. I've had approaches from all the other major supermarkets but it would not have felt right or honest to have worked with them. I know Sainsbury's Basic range like the back of my hand and I like their ethical policies. There's been some give and take \u2013 I only use free-range meat, for example \u2013 and it's a brave move of Sainsbury's to take me on. I'm not a cheeky chappy like Jamie \u2013 I am a tattooed, gobby single mum.\" Monroe, who blogs as \"A Girl Called Jack\" and is a freelance writer who contributes to the Guardian, has attracted a huge following for her carefully-costed recipes which often use pre-cooked and frozen products as well as canned food from value ranges. Her writing reflects her forensic scrutiny of supermarket price movements and Sainsbury's has been the recipient of her cost-conscious ire. Her recipe for Mumma Jack's Best Ever Chilli, 30p per portion, states: \"Since Sainsbury's has hiked up the price of kidney beans, I've bought dried ones.\" Although the Sainsbury's campaign is a one-off project with Monroe, the supermarket is privately hopeful of collaborating further with her in the future. The campaign is a post-Christmas attempt to tackle \"avoidable\" food waste after Britons spent \u00a319bn on food and drink over the festive season. In an apparent dig at Waitrose's use of culinary superstar Heston Blumenthal in its adverts, Sainsbury's said consumers are less interested in celebrities in these austere times. Sarah Warby, Sainsbury's marketing director, said: \"In the current economic environment we're all less interested in the ideas of celebrity chefs. We're looking more for help and inspiration from people you can really relate to and practical, achievable ideas for food your kids will actually eat.\" However, Monroe's appointment also reflects the impact that continued pressure on disposable incomes is having on supermarkets. New figures showed recently that Britain's four biggest supermarkets all lost market share for the first time in at least a decade over the last three months as they continued to be squeezed by cut-price supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl. Monroe will be joined in the campaign by: Pam Clarkson, a 74-year-old great-grandmother from Leeds who organises Christmas lunches in her area; self-styled \"gastrogeek\" Rejina Sabur-Cross who has written a book about Asian-themed food to cook \"when you're in a hurry, hungry or hard up\"; and Nick Coffer, a Watford-based father-of-two whose success as a food blogger has triggered two cookery books featuring healthy food on a budget. Monroe is also an active campaginer on the issue of food poverty and last week at the House of Commons handed in a petition questioning the recent escalation of the use of British food banks and calling for an emergency debate on the extent of hunger in the UK. After securing 100,000 signatures, the MPs' debate will take place this Wednesday \u2013 a week before Christmas Day \u2013 after an event at Westminster backed by The Trussell Trust network of food banks which will be addressed by Monroe herself. Monroe's first recipe book \u2013 with Penguin \u2013 will be published in February, although she is planning a second for later in the year \u2013 presumably in time for the lucrative Christmas market. Sainsbury's refused to disclose how much it is paying for Monroe's involvement in its new campaign. But Monroe said: \"If anyone says I am selling out to Sainsbury's they are so wrong. It would have felt wrong and dishonest \u2013 and disappointing to my followers \u2013 to have linked up with anybody else. I shop there, I use their products. I have never been paid to use them.\" Changing tastes: celebrities and supermarket ads Sainsbury's was the first UK supermarket to use a celebrity to help sell its products in 1930 when it hired Amy Johnson \u2013 a pilot and glamorous role model for Britain's housewives \u2013 to help promote Blue Kaddy tea. But Tesco is credited with transforming supermarket advertising in the 1990s when it hired Dudley Moore to front a quirky TV campaign that was a hit with audiences. The use of celebrity chefs is a more recent development as the cult of celebrity reached restaurant kitchens. In 2000 Sainsbury's signed up the then fresh-faced chef Jamie Oliver in one of the longest-running \u2013 and successful - collaborations of its kind, which was quickly copied by rivals. Phil Vickery, resident chef on TV programme This Morning, was snaffled by discounter Aldi, while more recently Delia Smith and Heston Blumenthal were the high-profile double act for Waitrose until she was dropped from their advertisements earlier this year. Smith herself \u2013 who had previously been the food editor of the first Sainsbury's food magazine in 1993 \u2013 famously criticised celebrity chefs who cash in on their fame with supermarket advertising deals and decisions to endorse particular stores, claiming it compromised their advice on which products to buy. The latest move by Sainsbury's \u2013 and the growing use of social media in marketing \u2013 seems to suggest that the old-fashioned link-ups between celebrity chefs and supermarkets have had their day.",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Tyrie's work is nearly done. The Conservative politician, who has been a key figure in attempts to clean up the banking system, stood up in the Commons last week to remind fellow MPs of the tasks that had been set for the parliamentary commission on banking standards, which he had chaired. The first was to report on professional standards in the banking industry in the wake of the Libor rigging crisis, and the second was to outline the lessons that could be learned for the government, while making recommendations for legislative change. Much of that work may be concluded this week, with the 200-page banking reform bill entering the Lords on Monday for what could be the last time. With just one amendment to the bill still proving contentious, there is an expectation the work will be completed before the Christmas recess. The legislation includes a package of measures intended to force senior bankers to take responsibility when things go wrong, allowing bankers to be charged with reckless misconduct if their institutions go bust, and forcing them to erect an \"electrified\" ringfence between their high-street and investment banking operations. Last week's debate in the Commons coincided with a timely reminder of the scandals that had first set Tyrie and his fellow commissioners \u2013 made up of lords and MPs including the former chancellor Lord Lawson and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby \u2013 upon their task. Lloyds Banking Group was fined a record \u00a328m for a bonus culture that saw staff mis-sell financial products, while Royal Bank of Scotland, which was also bailed out, was fined \u00a360m for breaching US sanctions rules. \"The banks have discovered that the scale of the damage done by the revelations and the scale of the fines that are now being imposed are systemic in implication for their institutions and that has shaken them up a lot,\" Tyrie told MPs last week. \"But I do think the culture at the top of our banks is changing.

    "webTitle": "Why the Federal Reserve must taper quantitative easing before Christmas", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Just do it. That's the message for the Federal Reserve as it decides this week whether its Christmas present to the American people should be to start scaling back on the $85bn (\u00a352bn) in newly minted electronic money it is chucking at the American economy each month. Wall Street thinks \u2013 and hopes \u2013 an announcement this week is unlikely. Financiers have enjoyed the Fed's gigantic monetary experiment. They have exchanged Treasury bills and mortgage-backed securities for cash, which they have used to play the global markets. Main Street has not done so well out of the Fed's quantitative easing programme. Indeed, by helping to generate speculative increases in commodity prices QE has squeezed disposable incomes and done as much harm as good. Back in September, the US central bank bottled a decision to wind down the programme and the markets believe the Fed will find an excuse for delaying again. March is now thought to be the time for tapering to begin. By that time, the new chairman of the Fed, Janet Yellen, will have her feet under the table. There may be stronger proof from the labour market by the spring that the world's biggest economy is on the mend. In truth, this Wednesday is as good a time as any for the Fed to make a start on its taper. The US economy is recovering; QE has been of questionable use; there are long-term risks in keeping the programme in place for too long; the financial markets are calm. The reasons for further delay are not especially good ones. The decision the Fed is making this week is not about whether to tighten policy. It is not even about removing the stimulus. It is about reducing the amount of stimulus, bit by bit. The Fed will probably start by cutting its asset-buying programme by $10bn a month. The difference will be imperceptible, not least because the judgment on QE will be that it was worth a try and helped initially to put a floor under the economy but has delivered less than promised. Commendably, the US authorities took a suck-it-and-see approach when the economy was in free fall in the winter of 2008-09. They experimented with zero interest rates, the troubled asset recovery programme (Tarp), forbearance in the real estate market, a fiscal stimulus and QE. Some of these ideas worked well, some \u2013 like QE \u2013 not so well. The minutes of the Fed's policy-making committee meeting in October show that even officials at the central bank have started to wonder whether the QE cost-benefit analysis stacks up. They suggest it might be \"appropriate to begin to wind down the programme before an unambiguous further improvement in the outlook was apparent\". Why? Because of \"concerns about the efficacy and costs of further asset prices\". In practice, this means that the Fed is worried about throwing good money after bad, worried that QE is distorting investment decisions and leading to the misallocation of capital, and worried about the losses it would make on behalf of the American taxpayer if there happened to be a sharp fall in the price of the bonds and securities it has bought in the past five years. The argument against an immediate taper is that the US economy is too fragile to cope with the shock \u2013 real or psychological \u2013 of a cutback in the scheme. It is true that by historic standards, the current recovery in the US is no great shakes, but it now looks well established. Interest rates have been low for the past six years and bank balance sheets have been cleaned up by the removal of toxic assets. What's more, even the biggest downturns will come to an end sooner or later. That ability to bounce back is more pronounced in the US than in other economies. The reason the recovery is not stronger is simple. Labour's share of national income has fallen steadily in the past three decades, and households accumulated uncomfortably high levels of debt in order to maintain or increase their spending. Since the financial crisis, Americans have been putting their finances back into shape by borrowing less. In theory, the shortfall caused by consumer retrenchment should have been filled by companies investing more because as labour's share of national income has fallen, that of capital has risen. Profits have been further boosted by the job cuts during the slump. There has, though, been no big surge in investment, even though the Fed's commitment to holding interest rates low for an unspecified period of time should make it more attractive for corporations to spend rather than hoard their cash. But this makes the case for a more active fiscal policy rather than for QE. It suggests that Barack Obama was too timid with his stimulus package, that cuts in federal spending have been too aggressive and that the budget row between Democrats and Republicans, which led to tax increases in early 2013 and the temporary shutdown of some parts of the government in October, has stifled growth. The Fed was well aware that trouble was brewing on Capitol Hill when it decided not to taper in September. But the two-year deal agreed last week lifts the threats of further spending cuts and offers the hope of peace on the budget front for the next two years. Fiscal policy \u2013 changes to tax and government spending \u2013 will be less of a drag on the economy in 2014 than it has been in 2013. There were, though, two other reasons for the Fed's postponement of the taper. The first was concern about the health of the jobs market; the second was fear that the financial markets would go into meltdown. Back in May, the hint from Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, that he was thinking about a taper was enough to cause bond and stock markets to sell off. This has certainly not been a jobs-rich US recovery and participation rates have been falling as discouraged workers have given up hope of finding a job. That has made the fall in unemployment look more impressive than it has actually been. But the rate of hiring has picked up in recent months and that trend should continue into the new year. Meanwhile, the financial markets appear to be a lot more sanguine about the taper than they were in the spring. If the Fed fears that a taper announcement will drive up interest rates, it should accompany an announcement with a commitment to keep the short-term cost of borrowing low. In truth, the market reaction is likely to be small, while consumer and business confidence may benefit from the impression that America is getting back on its feet. As soon as it has acted once, the Fed will wonder what all the fuss was about. It should get on with it.",

      "body": "<p>Steve Jobs, the man who turned Apple into a digital cult, once famously described the Macintosh computer team as \u201ca group of people going, in essence, back to the garage, but in a large company\u201d.&#xa0;</p> <p>Corporate America is having another one of its many Steve Jobs moments. As corporate sprawl becomes the norm, some companies are encouraging their workers to break off into entrepreneurial, startup-like teams: giving a section of the office, in effect, to serve as the old California garages that built Hewlett-Packard, Apple and other innovative tech giants. The world has seen too many dominant companies \u2013 BlackBerry and Motorola come to mind \u2013 who dominate markets and then squander their lead by being too slow in keeping up with new ideas.</p> <h2>Meet the intrapreneurs</h2> <p>That \"send in the entrepreneurs\" approach to management already has its own corporate buzzword: \"intrapreneurship\". Intrapreneurs are supposed to be dynamic employees who create entrepreneurial, profit-making ideas from the inside out. For some employees, who have ideas but yearn for stability, it can be innovation, without the starvation: a startup feeling with a stable paycheck, a 401k and stock options. Some companies see it as a way to retain employees who might otherwise wander off and take their best ideas with them: Google encourages 20% of employee time to be dedicated to work on anything \"cool or innovative\".</p> <p>Yet, as anyone who has worked in a big company knows, innovators are everywhere, and as Jobs himself showed, they usually prefer autonomy and freedom, and have a robust impatience with corporate bureaucracy. As a result, intrapreneurship now has the challenge of proving itself as a real trend and not just corporate wishful thinking.</p> <p>Intrapreneurs, of course, existed long before the term \"intrapreneurship\" did. Maggie De Pree, a promising intern for Nike in Oregon, set about attempting to make her stamp at the company. She invented methods of cutting the energy bill across retail stores by switching to efficient lighting and sustainable materials, which in turn brightened the shop displays. Now she <a href=\"http://www.changemakers.com/users/maggie-de-pree\">advises intrapreneurial teams at big companies</a>. Miriam Turner, <a href=\"http://www.sustainablebrands.com/users/miriam-turner\">now at Sustainable Brands,</a> formulated a smart idea at Interface, the world\u2019s largest carpet manufacturer, for buying fishing nets from East Asian communities and recycling them as nylon for carpet production.</p> <p>Still, though innovators grow everywhere, some companies prefer not to leave it to chance. A few have created formal programs to spur innovation.</p> <p>Gib Bulloch founded Accenture Development Partnerships, an initiative to brainstorm ideas for big companies doing business emerging markets. He launched it as an employee at Accenture. \u201cWe set up a business within a business,\" he says. \"It is not pro-bono; instead we use change making ideas to extend Accenture\u2019s services to developing countries at a fraction of the cost.\u201d</p> <p>One of Bulloch's current projects includes using Coca-Cola\u2019s expertise in distributing soda to bring better healthcare management to hard-to-reach places. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t understand how Coke could reach every corner of the planet, even where there was no access to healthcare,\u201d Bulloch says.</p> <h2>Corporate America's secret: innovation means friction</h2> <p>Consulting and services firms, in particular, love the sound of intrapreneurship: its shrewd initiative and entrepreneurial chutzpah, its promise of full-scale corporate renovation. \u201cFor us it is about encouraging empowerment and accountability amongst employees, whilst breeding a creative environment for our firm,\" says Uschi Schreiber, Global Markets Leader at Ernst &amp; Young. \"We want to foster real diversity in ideas and thinking, when going into clients\u2019 organizations.\u201d</p> <p>Still, many firms aren't sold on the idea, and it's a common story that innovative employees feel thwarted when trying to make a real impact. \u201cThere is a corporate inertia in this area,\" says Maggie De Pree, who continued:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"The reward structure only runs with the flow of business so innovation is not rewarded because it goes against the grain. When my colleague worked at Shell, they did not know what to make of her and her dynamic, inventive ideas. She was supposed to just be a marketing assistant.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Bulloch of Accenture also warns that there's something of a corporate ceiling on intrepreneurialism.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIf you want to climb the corporate ladder, this may not in fact be for you. By going against the status quo and taking on new projects, it could pose a risk to your day-to-day tasks. My fellow employees take a significant salary cut to work on our Development Partnerships program.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The dark truth is that many companies have big shareholders and don't want a madcap, innovative atmosphere in the office. \u201cCompanies may not necessarily want to be the big market \u2018disrupter\u2019; it is surprisingly important that they do not innovate too fast,\u201d says Professor Saikat Chaudhuri, executive director for the Mack Institute for Innovation Management at the Wharton School. Firms want to invent, experts say, but they also need to be wary about protecting their current streams of revenue and customers.</p> <p>\u201cLarger businesses may be resistant about forgoing their present way of doing things which, while not as creative, are attracting healthy profits that can be projected on a map,\u201d says De Pree. She found this was the case when her renewable-resources idea for Nike was eventually dismissed, on the premise, she says, that the company didn't want to take the risk of losing present current profits while experimenting with new technology.</p> <p>For employees, too, working on separate projects may not always align their interests with the rest of the company. It's hard to work on something you believe to be groundbreaking, then give it away to senior executives.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a trade-off between firms encouraging an innovative environment and employees becoming too focused on other ideas,\" says Chaudhuri. \"Ultimately, they may not be as interested in the company\u2019s wider business plans, but [are] rather just seeking their own personal gain.\u201d</p> <h2>Keeping entrepreneurs inside the walled garden</h2> <p>All those tensions usually mean that intrapreneurship results in professional separation, or even divorce. It isn't uncommon for smart employees to leave the companies where they built their ideas, and sell their idea back to the company or build it separately. Even with Google's rule of allowing 20% of employee time to be spent on creative projects, Anastasia Leng left her enviable job there as a new business development manager to start her own consumer goods company, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/anastasia-lengs-startup-makeably-2013-5\">Makeably</a>.</p> <p>Ernst &amp; Young battles these separations by integrating intrapreneurial projects with employees' day jobs, says Schreiber: \u201cWe do not encourage our colleagues to innovate in isolation. We incubate an idea within the context of day to day tasks, so they can build on it throughout their daily work.\u201d</p> <p>With the tech world, in particular, moving faster than ever, companies need idea people \u2013 and the idea people need the backing of companies \u201cIt is very hard for an employee or team to go it alone as conceptualizing a new idea is very resource intensive, which a large company can provide for,\" says Sharmila Chatterjee, Head of Enterprise Management Track at the MIT Sloan School of Management. \"If it is a novel approach, it will be picked up and the firm will boost it.\u201d</p> <p>Bulloch uses those resources as a selling point to his fellow employees at Accenture: \u201cbuilding a business idea is perfect within the Accenture ecosystem with access to thousands of suppliers and the strength of the brand name.\u201d</p> <p>Being an intrapreneur has its pitfalls. Those who pass the concept off as a mere buzzword are usually established executives, who are resistant and may see groups of intrepreneurs as a vigilante approach to business. Gib Bulloch at Accenture notes that a psychological shift is neessary: \u201cWe have to let our employees know that it is okay to think different,\u201d he says. Steve Jobs might have approved.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 December 2013 to correct the spelling of Professor Saikat Chaudhuri's name and clarify his position.</p>",

She found this was the case when her renewable-resources idea for Nike was eventually dismissed, on the premise, she says, that the company didn't want to take the risk of losing present current profits while experimenting with new technology. For employees, too, working on separate projects may not always align their interests with the rest of the company. It's hard to work on something you believe to be groundbreaking, then give it away to senior executives. \u201cThere is a trade-off between firms encouraging an innovative environment and employees becoming too focused on other ideas,\" says Chaudhuri. \"Ultimately, they may not be as interested in the company\u2019s wider business plans, but [are] rather just seeking their own personal gain.\u201d Keeping entrepreneurs inside the walled garden All those tensions usually mean that intrapreneurship results in professional separation, or even divorce. It isn't uncommon for smart employees to leave the companies where they built their ideas, and sell their idea back to the company or build it separately. Even with Google's rule of allowing 20% of employee time to be spent on creative projects, Anastasia Leng left her enviable job there as a new business development manager to start her own consumer goods company, Makeably. Ernst &amp; Young battles these separations by integrating intrapreneurial projects with employees' day jobs, says Schreiber: \u201cWe do not encourage our colleagues to innovate in isolation. We incubate an idea within the context of day to day tasks, so they can build on it throughout their daily work.\u201d With the tech world, in particular, moving faster than ever, companies need idea people \u2013 and the idea people need the backing of companies \u201cIt is very hard for an employee or team to go it alone as conceptualizing a new idea is very resource intensive, which a large company can provide for,\" says Sharmila Chatterjee, Head of Enterprise Management Track at the MIT Sloan School of Management. \"If it is a novel approach, it will be picked up and the firm will boost it.\u201d Bulloch uses those resources as a selling point to his fellow employees at Accenture: \u201cbuilding a business idea is perfect within the Accenture ecosystem with access to thousands of suppliers and the strength of the brand name.\u201d Being an intrapreneur has its pitfalls. Those who pass the concept off as a mere buzzword are usually established executives, who are resistant and may see groups of intrepreneurs as a vigilante approach to business. Gib Bulloch at Accenture notes that a psychological shift is neessary: \u201cWe have to let our employees know that it is okay to think different,\u201d he says. Steve Jobs might have approved. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 December 2013 to correct the spelling of Professor Saikat Chaudhuri's name and clarify his position.",

How is it different starting a company the second time around? Did you bring anything to the table from your first experience?</strong></p> <p>I think there are probably two things that are really different. One is very tangible and one is a little bit more emotional. The tangible: having launched a company for the first time was really valuable in that when you start a company you have to make thousands of decisions. Lots of them are really good decisions, hopefully, and some maybe aren't so good in retrospect. And having the opportunity to look back, you try to make better decisions.</p> <p>It's an amazing opportunity that you have the second time around. And very practically, at Warby Parker, one of the things that was amazing and still is amazing is that we built a network of people around us who are very good advisers and friends and who have been really helpful in building a brand. So I have a group of people that I can go to that advise me on what would and what wouldn't work.</p> <p>The thing for Harry's is that we invested a lot in technology infrastructure early, because we wanted to build a premium [company]. We had a huge brand opportunity, we wanted to build something that was incredibly scaleable.&#xa0;</p> <p>At Warby Parker, we invested less early just because we weren't sure exactly what the demand would be. And having seen [the demand] first time around, I knew that I want to go with more [investment] the second time. That's the tactical [side]. I think the relationship with a lot of the amazing people, including partnerships that we developed at Warby Parker were obviously incredibly beneficial to us at Harry's.</p> <p>The second [time] is a little bit more emotional, which is when you start a company, you care so much about it: the brand, the product, the customers. Then there are these tremendous highs when things go exactly as planned or go really well. And it can also lead to tough days when things don't go exactly as you wanted every time.&#xa0;There are periods when you are just trying to get through them. I think it's hard to do that, no matter how many times you've experienced that before that makes you feel prepared for that.</p> <p>There is always going to be another day \u2013 whether it's a low day or a high day, just try to enjoy it. And make sure that everyone around you enjoys it, because it's so special. That has helped make my experience the second time around even more enjoyable.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.inc.com/jana-kasperkevic/warby-parker-co-founder-why-we-opened-a-flagship-store.html\">Compared to Warby Parker</a>, you have launched Harry's much more quickly into a physical location. What was the decision behind that? How does having a store work with your primarily online model?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Our goal at Harry's was always to deliver an amazing shaving experiences and be a trusted source for men on grooming and taking care of themselves. We thought that if we could do those few things, if we could deliver that, we could create a brand that would be trusted, that we could form a strong bond, relationship with our customers.</p> <p>One of the things that we learned in launching Harry's is that regular guys don't always know how to take care of ourselves or take care of ourselves in the most appropriate way. The way we learned in our research is by going to barbershops, talking to barbers, and have them tell us how to shave, what products they use.</p> <p><strong>Andy:</strong> Jeff and I have always wanted to launch a barbershop. It was an idea that we had early on, when we were getting started on this adventure and talking to barbers and learning about how to shave and how to use the products. We wanted to take that experience to our customers. We thought it would be a really nice complement to the online experience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4a7c8af9-8f1b-41df-ba1b-14803f89d1e2\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/21/1385056582622/520d4ddb-dd24-4870-b36d-4e49bcd1c637-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Harry's barber shop\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry's barber shop in New York Photograph: Courtesy of Harry's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What made you think that you could break into these two very specific markets, eyewear and shaving, dominated by a handful of big companies?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> It's funny \u2013 both experiences didn't start with the actual marketplaces, but started with a customer experience that was sort of born out of the marketplace.&#xa0;</p> <p>With Warby Parker, what got me so excited was we came up with the idea with a group of my close friends. I had a $500 pair of Prada glasses that I had to change when my prescription changed. And they were literally held together by a piece of duct tape, but I still didn't want to replace my glasses because they were so expensive. So I was like, there is this huge customer base of people who would love to buy a new pair of glasses, but don't want to pay $500 for a pair they think would be fashionable and cool.</p> <p>That was the moment when one of my co-founders Neil, who worked in the industry before, told me that those glasses cost only a fraction of that. That to me made a lightbulb go off: Oh my God. We can do this so much better, in a more interesting way and we can create a brand -there hasn't been a lot of brand innovation in the industry- so we can create a brand that we could get behind, offering them a product at a value that was good for them.</p> <p>The funny thing was both this industry and the shaving industry are dominated by large companies, prices are incredibly high, brands have evolved for a long time \u2013 all those things are true, but for me and Andy, what started up an idea was not that set of facts, but the fact that we had personal experiences with products in the categories that could have been made better. We sort of took it a step up and looked at the market: \"Okay, this is why this dynamic exists. This is why people are not happy with their experiences. And this is how we can do it better.\"</p> <p><strong>When starting Harry's, what was your approach to hiring?</strong></p> <p><strong>Andy:</strong> It's probably the most important part of our job \u2013 actually building a strong team. Jeff and I often joke that we are the least impressive people at our company, which means that we are actually doing our jobs really well.</p> <p>There is obviously a big component of just: \"Are people passionate about the idea, the vision and the things that we are?\" Because it's hard. Starting a company at the early stages, there's a lots of challenges and roadblocks. Having vision and conviction around a brand, around an idea it's necessary to break through that. And that's probably the most important thing. And then I think beyond that, it's about creativity and innovation.</p> <p>You know, we don't have a massive marketing budget the same way that a big consumer product company might have. So we have to be just more creative about marketing events we do.</p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> There are a few things that have been helpful when starting a company: one, grow opportunities for people in a very concrete way. That way they understand what they are going to be doing, what their responsibilities are. We want to create a growth path for everybody so we talk to them about how they can grow, where they want to be in a couple of years, and then we try to coach them in how we can get there.</p> <p>The other thing is, culture in a company is a really interesting thing. It's a group of people who come together to do something amazing. Some of that starts to develop naturally based on the personalities \u2026 and we have really consciously kind of let that evolve, because we think we have really amazing people. But then, we have also, for the whole team, created a set of values for Harry's that hangs up on our wall, that we live by.</p> <p>We want to be transparent with each other. Andy and I go to great lengths to tell everyone whenever we've got something going on in the company, because they should know. We all need to have a passion for the community within our company.</p> <p>The last thing is, when we hire people, we don't just look for technical skill and talent but also for a cultural fit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-53c0a460-038c-41d7-81e6-d4e118b277ec\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/12/1386890819947/ebebf581-8f3d-441d-b6e6-30d3cb939661-460x340.jpeg\" alt=\"value board harry's\" width=\"460\" height=\"340\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The board of values at Harry's.

Photograph: Courtesy of Harry's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What is a 'cultural fit'?&#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong>&#xa0;We have a set of core values on the team around honesty, transparency, collaboration, respect, love for the team and our customers and doing good in the community \u2013 so we try to measure along those criteria.</p> <p>For me, when meeting people, I look for: one,&#xa0;humility and integrity. Does this person put the team (or others first)? Are they honest? Can I absolutely trust them?&#xa0;</p> <p>Two, ability to collaborate. Can they build consensus with others, share ideas, listen well and help the team move towards positive conclusions?</p> <p>Three, passion for Harry's: Are they passionate about our brand's mission and values? Are they going to be excited to come to work every day with our team? Are they upbeat and likeable and will they make our office a happier place? Are they committed to doing good in the world around them?</p> <p>It's a high bar, but we've been blown away by the type of people we are able to hire and then it's been so amazing to see them collaborate so well together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-27359bbb-ddf9-4ea9-8fe6-38c8e1a95045\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/9/1386611200189/eead71d5-39e4-4f02-b41c-4ea251b034b0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"woman shaving leg\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What about the ladies? Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Is Harry's going to offer lines of shaving supplies for ladies?&#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> [laughs] Yes. We are working on that.</p> <p><strong>Andy:</strong> We do have some women today that are Harry's customers and we promised not to tell anybody.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong>We have guys buying extra razors because their wives or girlfriends have been using theirs.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>A big component of both of your companies is sharing. At Warby Parker, <a href=\"http://www.warbyparker.com/do-good#home\">it's buy a pair, give a pair</a>. At Harry's, <a href=\"http://www.harrys.com/give-a-shave\">it's give a shave</a>. What made you want to incorporate a social component into your companies?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> A big part of it is that we feel that companies and brands need to have a broader sense of responsibilities to their communities. We think we as a team can play a much bigger role in helping guys do what shaving enables people to do \u2013 look and feel good about themselves in order to help them prepare personally, professionally for what's ahead. So we wanted to give this very small action of everyday life, which is shaving, and see if we could use our talented resources in the company to help complete that objective in other areas.</p> <p>\"Give a shave\" came out of a conversation Andy and I had, which [concluded that] we just care. We just give a shave about making a great product. We give a shave about the community around us. Thinking about the culture of company we wanted to build, we need to have more ways to give back to the world than just selling razors. Today for every $1 that we sell, we donate 1% to an organization called City Year, which is an amazing organization that helps prepare young people who are either going to college or are out of college for what's next.</p> <p>In addition to donating 1% of our sales, we have an amazing team here who can do amazing and incredible things in the context of \u2026 mentoring others. And so we also made a commitment, as a team, to donate 1% of our time, which is about 25 hours a year. I think most people are going to far exceed that [number], working with City Year or other organization like them.</p> <p>Over time, our dream would be to get our customers and the broader community to join us. Not only by buying products at Harry's, but also by joining in our efforts to volunteer and have a broader impact on the community.</p> <p><strong>You mentioned surrounding yourselves with talented people on whom you can rely for help and advice. What is the best business advice that you have received so far? What's the one thing you've taken to heart?&#xa0;</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeff:</strong> For me, there are two things. First, just focus on doing something that you are really incredibly passionate about. For me, I wanted to wake up in the middle of the night and start to think about research, begin writing the business plan. You need that level of passion to be successful, because it is hard work. When you like the work, you know that it's going to be worth it and you are going to be successful.&#xa0;</p> <p>Second thing, as for business advice, the brand and the product are the two most important things that Andy and I spent all our time on. Making sure that what we give our customers every day is the most amazing possible thing. Making sure that we have a team that loves our customers and cares about their experience. At the end of the day, that's all that matters: really happy customers.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Andy:&#xa0;</strong>One thing that I would add to that is just the idea around honesty and transparency. Customers today, they expect that from the businesses they chose to have relationships with. Just treat your customers like people. Tell them the truth. Tell them how the product is made. Tell them where it comes from, beyond the prices that you are charging. It just goes a long way to tell the truth and be honest and builds a lot more of a positive rapport.</p>",

Jeff: There are a few things that have been helpful when starting a company: one, grow opportunities for people in a very concrete way. That way they understand what they are going to be doing, what their responsibilities are. We want to create a growth path for everybody so we talk to them about how they can grow, where they want to be in a couple of years, and then we try to coach them in how we can get there. The other thing is, culture in a company is a really interesting thing. It's a group of people who come together to do something amazing. Some of that starts to develop naturally based on the personalities \u2026 and we have really consciously kind of let that evolve, because we think we have really amazing people. But then, we have also, for the whole team, created a set of values for Harry's that hangs up on our wall, that we live by. We want to be transparent with each other. Andy and I go to great lengths to tell everyone whenever we've got something going on in the company, because they should know. We all need to have a passion for the community within our company. The last thing is, when we hire people, we don't just look for technical skill and talent but also for a cultural fit. What is a 'cultural fit'? Jeff: We have a set of core values on the team around honesty, transparency, collaboration, respect, love for the team and our customers and doing good in the community \u2013 so we try to measure along those criteria. For me, when meeting people, I look for: one, humility and integrity. Does this person put the team (or others first)? Are they honest? Can I absolutely trust them? Two, ability to collaborate. Can they build consensus with others, share ideas, listen well and help the team move towards positive conclusions? Three, passion for Harry's: Are they passionate about our brand's mission and values? Are they going to be excited to come to work every day with our team? Are they upbeat and likeable and will they make our office a happier place? Are they committed to doing good in the world around them? It's a high bar, but we've been blown away by the type of people we are able to hire and then it's been so amazing to see them collaborate so well together. Is Harry's going to offer lines of shaving supplies for ladies? Jeff: [laughs] Yes. We are working on that. Andy: We do have some women today that are Harry's customers and we promised not to tell anybody. Jeff:We have guys buying extra razors because their wives or girlfriends have been using theirs. A big component of both of your companies is sharing. At Warby Parker, it's buy a pair, give a pair. At Harry's, it's give a shave. What made you want to incorporate a social component into your companies? Jeff: A big part of it is that we feel that companies and brands need to have a broader sense of responsibilities to their communities. We think we as a team can play a much bigger role in helping guys do what shaving enables people to do \u2013 look and feel good about themselves in order to help them prepare personally, professionally for what's ahead. So we wanted to give this very small action of everyday life, which is shaving, and see if we could use our talented resources in the company to help complete that objective in other areas. \"Give a shave\" came out of a conversation Andy and I had, which [concluded that] we just care. We just give a shave about making a great product. We give a shave about the community around us. Thinking about the culture of company we wanted to build, we need to have more ways to give back to the world than just selling razors. Today for every $1 that we sell, we donate 1% to an organization called City Year, which is an amazing organization that helps prepare young people who are either going to college or are out of college for what's next. In addition to donating 1% of our sales, we have an amazing team here who can do amazing and incredible things in the context of \u2026 mentoring others. And so we also made a commitment, as a team, to donate 1% of our time, which is about 25 hours a year. I think most people are going to far exceed that [number], working with City Year or other organization like them. Over time, our dream would be to get our customers and the broader community to join us. Not only by buying products at Harry's, but also by joining in our efforts to volunteer and have a broader impact on the community. You mentioned surrounding yourselves with talented people on whom you can rely for help and advice. What is the best business advice that you have received so far? What's the one thing you've taken to heart? Jeff: For me, there are two things. First, just focus on doing something that you are really incredibly passionate about. For me, I wanted to wake up in the middle of the night and start to think about research, begin writing the business plan. You need that level of passion to be successful, because it is hard work. When you like the work, you know that it's going to be worth it and you are going to be successful. Second thing, as for business advice, the brand and the product are the two most important things that Andy and I spent all our time on. Making sure that what we give our customers every day is the most amazing possible thing. Making sure that we have a team that loves our customers and cares about their experience. At the end of the day, that's all that matters: really happy customers. Andy: One thing that I would add to that is just the idea around honesty and transparency. Customers today, they expect that from the businesses they chose to have relationships with. Just treat your customers like people. Tell them the truth. Tell them how the product is made. Tell them where it comes from, beyond the prices that you are charging. It just goes a long way to tell the truth and be honest and builds a lot more of a positive rapport.",

      "bodyText": "This week Ben Bernanke chairs his last meeting as head of the Federal Reserve \u2013 a position that has undoubtedly become the most important job in finance under his tenure. When that meeting ends on Wednesday, investors and government officials around the world will be waiting to see if Bernanke's exit will also signal the unwinding of his signature policy. In November 2008, as the world was rocked by the worst financial crisis in living memory, Bernanke launched a series of ambitious, costly and controversial attempts to put the US economy back on course. The wonkish-sounding \"quantitative easing\" (QE) programme aimed to bring down interest rates and encourage investment, by buying billions in bonds and other securities. The third round of QE was launched in September 2012 and under it the Fed is currently buying $85bn a month in mortgage-backed securities and other bonds. So far QE3 has added $1.1 trillion to the Fed's balance sheet and critics have worried about unintended consequences like a housing bubble or artificially inflated stock markets. But the medicine appears to be working. Unemployment has come down to a five-year low, house prices are slowly rising, inflation seems under control and stock markets are near record highs. Bernanke has signalled he will begin cutting QE when the economy is stronger. So will December be the month that US Inc is ready to go it alone? \"The economy is undoubtedly stronger than it was in September 2012,\" said Gus Faucher, senior macroeconomist at PNC Bank. \"I still think January is more likely. I think they'll want more data.\" Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said December could be the month, but that doubts remained. \"I'd put it at 60/40,\" he said. \"The problem is Fed officials are very vague. Every official seems to have a different way of looking at the data.\" Perhaps the simplest way to look at whether the Fed is ready to \"taper\" QE now is to look at the reasons it set out for not cutting back in September, the last time that it held a major meeting and press conference. Then Fed officials had three main concerns: Washington's seemingly endless budget battle, a stutter in the jobs market's recovery and a rise in long-term interest rates. A lot has changed in the last three months. Last week Congress finally agreed a budget, ending more than two years of economically destabilising battles. Questions remain, but the willingness to reach a deal \u2013 long absent in Washington \u2013 is a good start. Bernanke has consistently cited political infighting as a drag on the economy. Last September's meeting came before a government shutdown many feared would damage the still-struggling economy. The new deal, while modest in scope, amounts to a ceasefire that will come as a huge relief to business leaders looking for real answers from Washington on issues such as immigration and the tax code. The jobs market also seems to be on the mend. The unemployment rate fell to a five-year low of 7% last month. The US had added 203,000 new jobs in November, the 38th consecutive month of growth, but, more importantly for the Fed, jobs growth has now averaged more than 200,000 a month over the last four months. Again though, problems remain. The drop in unemployment is partly driven by people giving up and leaving the workforce. Long-term unemployment remains high, as does youth unemployment. The jobless rate for African-Americans is 12.5%, more than twice the 6.2% rate for white people and higher than the level for Hispanics, 8.7%. There is some way to go before the US makes up for the jobs it lost in the recession. Some have speculated that it may never get there. But the fact remains that the job market is stronger now than it was in September. The final concern the Fed expressed back in September was about interest rates. Long-term interest rates started rising in May after the Fed hinted it might start cutting back on QE. Since then the Fed has been at pains to emphasise that any tapering in QE will not be paired with a rise in its base rates. The message seems to have got through and long-term rates have dipped. Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics said it looked certain that QE would be cut soon, but thought it more likely to happen under the tenure of Bernanke's successor, Janet Yellen. The programme had largely worked: the difficulty the Fed now faced was how to unwind it, he said. \"The biggest risk now is, can they bring this to an end gracefully?\" he said. \"Janet Yellen is going to own that. She should start it.\"",

A new offence of reckless misconduct, for bankers who run their institutions into the ground, will also be introduced.</p> <p>There are those who say the new law will be impossible to enforce. Even so, it may yet prove to be a deterrent to any banker whose management strategy is growth at any cost. Just think of the sales advisers at Lloyds Banking Group.&#xa0;One of them was so terrified about being demoted that he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/11/lloyds-mis-selling-scandal-champagne-bonuses\" title=\"\">sold himself a financial product</a>.

The bank paid bonuses even when it knew that the customers were being sold products they did not need.</p> <p>It is a shocking affair. So, on whom did the FCA pin the blame? There's the problem. Not a single individual at Lloyds is named by the regulator. Instead the firm is fined for serious failings in its systems and controls. That cannot be right.</p> <h2>Eurozone festivities? Don't bank on them<br></h2> <p>December is a time for clearing the decks as well as decking the halls, so tThere is a satisfying completeness about Ireland's formal exit from its bailout package this weekend. More than five years into the crisis, and with fellow bailout victims Greece, Portugal and Cyprus still racked with economic hardship and political instability, Ireland is a welcome success story for the eurozone.</p> <p>After ministers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/13/eurozone-banking-union-step-closer\" title=\"\">finally agreed the basics of a pan-European banking union last week,</a> there is cause for hope that 2014 will be the calmest year since the onset of the credit crunch. Ireland certainly appears to think so, given its decision to jump free of the troika without the safety net of a precautionary credit line from the IMF.</p> <p>But there's also reason to be cautious. On the agenda for the new year are a series of knotty financial and economic questions: how will debt-laden eurozone states cope with higher bond yields if Fed tapering pushes up borrowing costs? How will Greece's \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.4bn) funding gap for next year be met \u2013 and what fresh agony will its population have to endure in exchange? Will Portugal's fragile coalition continue pushing through tough austerity measures without sparking a renewed political crisis? What happens if the ECB's \"asset quality review\" of the region's banks reveals black holes in their balance sheets that national governments will struggle to fill?</p> <p>All these potential dramas will be played out against the background of a eurozone economy barely emerged from recession, where deflation appears a serious prospect and a rise in the value of the euro on the foreign exchanges is threatening the competitiveness of even mighty Germany.</p> <p>It was these fears that prompted the ECB to deliver a surprise cut in interest rates last month, and led its president, Mario Draghi, to strike anything but a festive note, warning that \u2013 unlike the snow in the carol \u2013 economic recovery in the eurozone is \"weak, fragile and uneven\". Ireland's progress is cause for celebration, but doesn't mean the eurozone as a whole is destined for a happy new year.</p> <h2>Sometimes it pays to walk\u2026<br></h2> <p>Some bosses of FTSE 100 companies cling on to their jobs even when it seems unlikely they can survive. Think Nick Buckles, former chief executive of accident-prone outsourcing company G4S, who did not quit until May, eight months after the Olympics staffing fiasco.</p> <p>There are others who go only when pushed. Think Bob Diamond, the one-time boss of Barclays, who left only after the Bank of England eased him out in the wake of the Libor scandal.</p> <p>Then there is Simon Lee, chief executive of insurance company RSA. A&#xa0;month ago, when the insurer uncovered a problem at its Irish unit, he had looked hopeful about keeping his role. The dividend, he thought at the time, would not be threatened. On Friday, however, when the hole deepened by another \u00a3130m and assurances could no longer be given about the dividend, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/13/rsa-insurance-chief-quits-profit-warning\" title=\"\">Lee walked</a>.

A new offence of reckless misconduct, for bankers who run their institutions into the ground, will also be introduced. There are those who say the new law will be impossible to enforce. Even so, it may yet prove to be a deterrent to any banker whose management strategy is growth at any cost. Just think of the sales advisers at Lloyds Banking Group. One of them was so terrified about being demoted that he sold himself a financial product. He did not stop there. He sold one to his wife and his colleague to achieve sales targets. This culture was exposed last week when the bank was fined a record \u00a328m. The FCA shed light on a brutal six-tier salary structure at Lloyds in which advisers could automatically be demoted if they failed to reach sales targets. The bank paid bonuses even when it knew that the customers were being sold products they did not need. It is a shocking affair. So, on whom did the FCA pin the blame? There's the problem. Not a single individual at Lloyds is named by the regulator. Instead the firm is fined for serious failings in its systems and controls. That cannot be right. Eurozone festivities? Don't bank on them December is a time for clearing the decks as well as decking the halls, so tThere is a satisfying completeness about Ireland's formal exit from its bailout package this weekend. More than five years into the crisis, and with fellow bailout victims Greece, Portugal and Cyprus still racked with economic hardship and political instability, Ireland is a welcome success story for the eurozone. After ministers finally agreed the basics of a pan-European banking union last week, there is cause for hope that 2014 will be the calmest year since the onset of the credit crunch. Ireland certainly appears to think so, given its decision to jump free of the troika without the safety net of a precautionary credit line from the IMF. But there's also reason to be cautious. On the agenda for the new year are a series of knotty financial and economic questions: how will debt-laden eurozone states cope with higher bond yields if Fed tapering pushes up borrowing costs? How will Greece's \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.4bn) funding gap for next year be met \u2013 and what fresh agony will its population have to endure in exchange? Will Portugal's fragile coalition continue pushing through tough austerity measures without sparking a renewed political crisis? What happens if the ECB's \"asset quality review\" of the region's banks reveals black holes in their balance sheets that national governments will struggle to fill? All these potential dramas will be played out against the background of a eurozone economy barely emerged from recession, where deflation appears a serious prospect and a rise in the value of the euro on the foreign exchanges is threatening the competitiveness of even mighty Germany. It was these fears that prompted the ECB to deliver a surprise cut in interest rates last month, and led its president, Mario Draghi, to strike anything but a festive note, warning that \u2013 unlike the snow in the carol \u2013 economic recovery in the eurozone is \"weak, fragile and uneven\". Ireland's progress is cause for celebration, but doesn't mean the eurozone as a whole is destined for a happy new year. Sometimes it pays to walk\u2026 Some bosses of FTSE 100 companies cling on to their jobs even when it seems unlikely they can survive. Think Nick Buckles, former chief executive of accident-prone outsourcing company G4S, who did not quit until May, eight months after the Olympics staffing fiasco. There are others who go only when pushed. Think Bob Diamond, the one-time boss of Barclays, who left only after the Bank of England eased him out in the wake of the Libor scandal. Then there is Simon Lee, chief executive of insurance company RSA. A month ago, when the insurer uncovered a problem at its Irish unit, he had looked hopeful about keeping his role. The dividend, he thought at the time, would not be threatened. On Friday, however, when the hole deepened by another \u00a3130m and assurances could no longer be given about the dividend, Lee walked. A sensible decision.",

Should Smiths investors be given a break? Breaking up is hard to do, and technology group Smiths seems to have been doing its best to prove the point. Despite a number of approaches for its medical business in recent times \u2013 private equity group Apax was said to be offering around \u00a32.5bn, California's Carefusion \u00a33bn \u2013 Smiths has held on to the division, although to be fair, it has made the usual noises about considering all options in the best interests of shareholders. The FTSE 100 company holds an investor day this Tuesday, mainly to talk about its John Crane oil and gas division. But questions about the future of the medical division should by rights also be on the agenda. Analysts at Morgan Stanley pointed out last week that there is consolidation under way in the medical sector, and they believed Smiths could get between \u00a32.5bn and \u00a34bn if it sold the business. They believe the shares are undervalued because the company is seen as a conglomerate, something a break-up of the business could resolve. Next week's meeting \u2013 being held in Dubai \u2013 should focus the attention of both investors and the company itself on the way forward. Co-op takes a step out of the mire Co-operative Bank has hardly been out of the headlines for all the wrong reasons, with \"crystal methodist\" Paul Flowers the most glaring example of how not to run a financial institution. But next week should finally see the resolution of the financial trauma surrounding the bank, as it plugs a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall with a complex restructuring. Institutional bondholders, including hedge funds, vote tomorrow on whether to accept the proposed deal, that would see them take control of the bank, leaving the Co-operative Group itself owning just 30%. Given that retail bondholders, who were most likely to balk at the terms, voted in favour of the deal last week, this latest vote is expected to get the go-ahead. Wednesday would then see a court hearing to sanction the scheme, with settlement due on Friday. Meanwhile, former City minister Paul Myners is joining the Co-op Group \u2013 receiving a token \u00a31 annual salary \u2013 as an independent director and will conduct a review of its management structure. The board is already expected to face heavy criticism for its role in the bank's problems from an inquiry led by Sir Christopher Kelly, while City and accountancy regulators consider whether to launch inquiries.",
