      "bodyText": "Companies should publish the pay gap between their bosses and their workforce in an effort to shame big business into curbing excessive pay, according to a leading thinktank. Data published by the High Pay Centre and advisory body Manifest earlier this year showed that the ratio of chief executive pay in the FTSE 100 to their average employee was 150:1 in 2014: average pay for a FTSE 100 chief executive was \u00a35.2m compared with \u00a334,846 for the workforce. Top executives also benefit from a number of perks that are denied to those outside the higher echelons, from tickets to sports events to expenses for attending award ceremonies and the costs of chauffeurs, car parking and children\u2019s school fees. \u201cPay ratios \u2013 revealing the gap between what is paid at the top and the middle of a business \u2013 could help bring back at least a modicum of shame or embarrassment into our boardrooms,\u201d said Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre. \u201cIf we really want to be \u2018all in this together\u2019, to use a phrase that has sadly fallen into abeyance, a narrower gap between pay at the top and what the rest of the organisation receives would be a positive sign,\u201d said Stern. In a report published on Wednesday, the High Pay Centre said: \u201cWaiving of bonuses has become a modern form of noblesse oblige.\u201d In 12 years between 1995 and 2007, some 16 company chief executives waived their bonuses, while in the six years to 2014, 15 chief executives did not take their bonus. Stern said he looked forward to a positive response on pay ratios from Sajid Javid, the business secretary, whose predecessor, Vince Cable, announced new binding votes on executive pay in 2012. The pay gap is a topic that has been raised by Boris Johnson, who told the Conservative party conference in October that social ties would fray if the economic gap between citizens grew too big. In what was interpreted as a swipe against Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of the advertising group WPP, the London mayor said: \u201cAnd there are some gigantic self-appointed sequoias that pay themselves 780 times the salary of the little shrublets they employ.\u201d In the US, companies will be forced to publish their pay ratios from 2017.",

      "bodyText": "European banks are sitting on bad debts of \u20ac1tn \u2013 the equivalent to the GDP of Spain \u2013 which is holding back their profitability and ability to lend to high street customers and businesses. According to a detailed analysis of 105 banks across 21 countries in the European Union conducted by the European Banking Authority (EBA), the experience of Europe\u2019s banks to troubled customers is worse than that of their counterparts in the US. The \u20ac1tn (\u00a3706bn) of so-called non-performing loans amount to almost 6% of the total loans and advances of Europe\u2019s banks and 10% when lending to other financial institutions are excluded. The equivalent figure for the US banking industry is around 3%. Piers Haben, director of oversight at the EBA, said that while the resilience of the financial sector was improving because more capital was being accumulated in banks, he remained concerned about bad debts. \u201cEU banks will need to continue addressing the level of non-performing loans which remain a drag on profitability,\u201d Haben said. Banks in Cyprus have half their lending classified as non-performing while in the UK the figure is 2.8%. Capital ratios \u2013 a closely watched measure of financial strength \u2013had reached 12.8% by June 2015, well above the regulatory minimum, as banks held on to profits and also took steps to raise capital - for instance, by tapping shareholders for cash. In 2011, the figure was 9.7%. The UK\u2019s banks covered by the survey \u2013 Barclays, HSBC and the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 hold 11.8% of capital, below the EU average. The EBA also published data on the leverage ratio, which is regarded as a very pure measure of financial strength as it does not take into account the risks being taken. This showed that of the four UK banks included in the sample, Barclays has the lowest leverage ratio at 4%. The EBA is not conducting health checks on banks for 2015 as it did in 2014, when 24 banks - none of them from the UK - failed the test. But the Bank of England is assessing the health of the UK\u2019s lenders and will publish the results on Tuesday, when their ability to withstand a dramatic slowdown in China, a contraction in the eurozone and the worst deflation since the 1930s will be announced. To fend off criticism from banks that being forced to hold more capital impedes their ability to lend, the EBA said capital ratios had increased by 3.3% in the first half of 2015 while lending had increased by 3.9%, some \u20ac74bn. It said: \u201cThis underpins the idea that better-capitalised banks are in a better position to increase the flow of lending to the real economy.\u201d \u201cAn increase in cross-border lending is also evident,\u201d the EBA said, in contrast to the eurozone crisis, when banks had hunkered down and channelled their lending to domestic companies and individuals. \u201cThe increase in lending has been accompanied by a very gradual improvement of asset quality, although levels of non-performing exposures in EU banks remain a concern and a potential impediment to lending growth and profitability,\u201d the EBA said. The EBA said the profitability of banks was improving in the wake of the financial crisis, but was still low by historic standards. This presents a challenge for ongoing efforts to strengthen the banking industry, not only in the wake of the 2008 crisis but also the fears of near-break up of the eurozone in 2012. The regulator considered a number of reasons for the slow growth in profits. As well as bad debts, the EBA pointed to the cost inefficiencies and the cost of so-called conduct issues, such as fines, compensation and legal costs, which absorb almost 4% of banks\u2019 operating income.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u201cI have no idea why I was offered a contract with a bonus in it because I promise you I will not work any harder or any less hard in any year, in any day, because someone is going to pay me more or less.\u201d John Cryan, the new co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank, was only being honest. It has always been a fantasy that the whiff of a bonus makes members of the executive class strive harder or better. Pay-for-performance, the supposed philosophical underpinning, is an elaborate cover story, encouraged by fund managers who drink from the same trough and endorsed by consultants with spreadsheets for sale. Jeroen van der Veer, former chief executive of oil giant Shell, was similarly candid half a decade ago: \u201cIf I had been paid 50% more, I would not have done [the job] better,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had been paid 50% less then I would not have done it worse.\u201d The problem, of course, is persuading remuneration committees to apply common sense, and executives to accept reform. Cryan, unlike Van der Veer, has made his comments at the start of his reign as chief executive. Does that mean he will refuse to sign the bonus-laden contract he regards as nonsensical? Don\u2019t hold your breath. When he was asked last month whether, given Deutsche\u2019s appalling recent performance, he would decline to take a bonus for 2015 or 2016, Cryan didn\u2019t exactly volunteer to lead by example. \u201cThis is a matter for the supervisory board,\u201d he replied. That\u2019s what they all say. Good logic, bad tactics Dermot Desmond never normally comes across as the hesitant type. The Irish investor-cum-gambler-cum-racehorse-owner stayed at the Sandy Lane hotel in Barbados in 1996 and liked it so much he decided to buy it the next day, or so the story goes. A dash of impulsive spirit would have worked better at Ladbrokes if Desmond was serious about trying to quash the \u00a32.3bn merger with Gala Coral. He launched in public his blistering point-by-point attack on the deal\u2019s logic only last week. If he had fired off his analysis in July, soon after the betting firms announced their deal, he would have stood a better chance of converting a few sleepy fund managers to his cause. As it was, 96% of votes backed the Ladbrokes board, implying that Desmond, waving his 2.8% holding, was virtually alone. That\u2019s a shame because two central points raised by Desmond deserved a full debate. First, the \u201cscale and cost\u201d of shop disposals that will be forced by the Competition &amp; Markets Authority (CMA), is \u201ctotally unknown\u201d, and thus a big risk to the deal\u2019s arithmetic. Second, Playtech, software supplier to both Ladbrokes and Coral, will receive a \u00a375m termination payment as a result of the merger but will then be rehired on terms as least as good as the old ones; that hardly indicates tough negotiating by the merger partners. Desmond, after confessing regret at not going public earlier, vowed to attempt a late run on the outside. In practice, that means trying to force a fresh shareholder vote on the deal after the CMA has spoken. Since Ladbrokes chairman Peter Erskine has already said no, another vote looks a very long shot indeed. Desmond got his tactics wrong. Rolls-Royce must reserve its seats Even after five profits warnings in two years, it\u2019s still too early for Rolls-Royce to be confident that its rotten run is about to end. New(ish) chief executive Warren East confessed that \u201cmud in the system\u201d and \u201caccounting fog\u201d could mask problems that would prompt another warning. Fair enough. By this stage shareholders will be happy with any boss who promises to improve internal controls, remove bureaucracy and respond quicker to shifts in the market. East\u2019s blueprint for self-help sounds like the work of half a decade, but the prescription seems broadly correct. Does he need a helper? Specifically, should ValueAct, a US activist hedge fund and now 10% shareholder in Rolls, be granted its request for a seat on the board? The company is considering the proposal and many big City shareholders are said to be keen. Don\u2019t do it. Hedge funds come in many varieties and ValueAct is more long-termist than most. It is also said to be co-operative in style. But it is too soon for a board seat. Let ValueAct offer its ideas and any expertise from the outside and assess its contributions after a year or so. East and colleagues should have a clear run at the outset \u2013 it\u2019s what they are being paid for.",

Does that mean he will refuse to sign the bonus-laden contract he regards as nonsensical?</p> <p>Don\u2019t hold your breath. When he was asked last month whether, given Deutsche\u2019s appalling recent performance, he would decline to take a bonus for 2015 or 2016, Cryan didn\u2019t exactly volunteer to lead by example. \u201cThis is a matter for the supervisory board,\u201d he replied. That\u2019s what they all say.</p> <h2><strong>Good logic, bad tactics</strong></h2> <p>Dermot Desmond never normally comes across as the hesitant type. The Irish investor-cum-gambler-cum-racehorse-owner stayed at the Sandy Lane hotel in Barbados in 1996 and liked it so much he decided to buy it the next day, or so the story goes.<br></p> <p>A dash of impulsive spirit would have worked better at Ladbrokes if Desmond was serious about trying to quash the \u00a32.3bn merger with Gala Coral. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/24/ladbrokes-chiefs-shareholder-meeting-dermot-desmond\">He launched in public his blistering point-by-point attack</a> on the deal\u2019s logic only last week. If he had fired off his analysis in July, soon after the betting firms announced their deal, he would have stood a better chance of converting a few sleepy fund managers to his cause.</p> <p>As it was, 96% of votes backed the Ladbrokes board, implying that Desmond, waving his 2.8% holding, was virtually alone. That\u2019s a shame because two central points raised by Desmond deserved a full debate. First, the \u201cscale and cost\u201d of shop disposals that will be forced by the Competition &amp; Markets Authority (CMA), is \u201ctotally unknown\u201d, and thus a big risk to the deal\u2019s arithmetic.</p> <p>Second, Playtech, software supplier to both Ladbrokes and Coral, will receive a \u00a375m termination payment as a result of the merger but will then be rehired on terms as least as good as the old ones; that hardly indicates tough negotiating by the merger partners.</p> <p>Desmond, after confessing regret at not going public earlier, vowed to attempt a late run on the outside. In practice, that means trying to force a fresh shareholder vote on the deal after the CMA has spoken. Since Ladbrokes chairman Peter Erskine has already said no, another vote looks a very long shot indeed. Desmond got his tactics wrong.</p> <h2>Rolls-Royce must reserve its seats</h2> <p>Even after five profits warnings in two years, it\u2019s still too early for Rolls-Royce to be confident that its rotten run is about to end. New(ish) chief executive Warren East confessed that \u201cmud in the system\u201d and \u201caccounting fog\u201d could mask problems that would prompt another warning.<br></p> <p>Fair enough. By this stage shareholders will be happy with any boss who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/24/rolls-royce-chief-warns-of-senior-job-cuts-because-engine-maker-needs-fixing\">promises to improve internal controls, remove bureaucracy and respond quicker to shifts in the market.</a> East\u2019s blueprint for self-help sounds like the work of half a decade, but the prescription seems broadly correct.</p> <p>Does he need a helper? Specifically, should ValueAct, a US activist hedge fund and now 10% shareholder in Rolls, be granted its request for a seat on the board? The company is considering the proposal and many big City shareholders are said to be keen.</p> <p>Don\u2019t do it. Hedge funds come in many varieties and ValueAct is more long-termist than most. It is also said to be co-operative in style. But it is too soon for a board seat. Let ValueAct offer its ideas and any expertise from the outside and assess its contributions after a year or so. East and colleagues should have a clear run at the outset \u2013 it\u2019s what they are being paid for.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor is to announce hundreds of millions of pounds of extra funding for Britain\u2019s railways to ensure Network Rail can carry out the bulk of its five-year plan, saving face for the government after it was forced to shelve two major rail projects due to overspending this year. Two reviews into Network Rail\u2019s abortive \u00a338bn upgrade programme are to be published alongside Wednesday\u2019s autumn statement, as ministers try discreetly to draw a line under a crisis that forced them to abandon manifesto pledges weeks after the general election when the ballooning costs became apparent. Sir Peter Hendy, the new chairman of Network Rail, has told the government that nearly all of the promised work could be delivered with additional funds \u2013 money the Treasury will now make available \u2013 although some will be postponed until the next funding period. The two electrification schemes \u201cpaused\u201d in June \u2013 on the Midland Mainline and TransPennine route \u2013 will be officially restarted, although delays will mean they are not completed until the next decade. The railway expenditure George Osborne is set to announce will ensure the Conservative party meets key manifesto pledges to improve the rail network between northern cities and to speed up connections from London to Norwich and Ipswich. A parallel review by Dame Colette Bowe will absolve ministers from direct responsibility for the funding fiasco, while pointing to some communication and accountability problems within the Department for Transport. Labour has accused ministers of covering up the extent of Network Rail problems until after the election, because its chief executive, Mark Carne, said he had raised concerns early in 2014. Bowe will renew criticism of Network Rail for its errors, lack of focus and poor cost-estimates, which have tripled the budget for electrifying the Great Western mainline to \u00a32.8bn in two years. Bowe will also turn her fire on the rail regulator, the Office for Rail and Road, which demanded cuts to an already optimistic budget. Bowe will also propose a new mandarin role at the DfT with sole responsibility for rail projects and enhancements. The DfT has already agreed to a 30% cut in its day-to-day spending by 2020, although sources believe the increases in so-called capital expenditure on transport infrastructure will mitigate cuts. Spending on transport in the capital will come under severe pressure with Transport for London fearing its revenue grant,which subsidises daily operations, will be axed before the end of the decade \u2013 and either driving up fares or cutting services. The budget for HS2, the high-speed rail network, is also expected to be revised, restating the bill at 2015 prices in an accounting move that could see the official cost estimate topping \u00a360bn.",

Bowe will also turn her fire on the rail regulator, the <a href=\"http://orr.gov.uk/\">Office for Rail and Road</a>, which demanded cuts to an already optimistic budget. </p> <p>Bowe will also propose a new mandarin role at the DfT with sole responsibility for rail projects and enhancements.</p> <p>The DfT has already agreed to a 30% cut in its day-to-day spending by 2020, although sources believe the increases in so-called capital expenditure on transport infrastructure will mitigate cuts. </p> <p>Spending on transport in the capital will come under severe pressure with Transport for London fearing its revenue grant,which subsidises daily operations, will be axed before the end of the decade \u2013 and either driving up fares or cutting services. </p> <p>The budget for HS2, the high-speed rail network, is also expected to be revised, restating the bill at 2015 prices in an accounting move that could see the official cost estimate topping \u00a360bn.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Irish billionaire Dermot Desmond has launched a stinging attack on the management of Ladbrokes at its annual general meeting, but failed to scupper the company\u2019s \u00a32.3bn merger with Gala Coral. Desmond, who owns Celtic Football Club, attended the meeting in London, which was called to ratify the deal to create the UK\u2019s biggest bookmaker. It in effect involves privately owned Gala Coral buying Ladbrokes and listing on the stock exchange. The financier said he intended to continue his fight even though shareholders overwhelmingly voted the deal through, although it is yet to be scrutinised by the Competition and Markets Authority. Desmond warned the merger could lead to forced disposals of between 400 and 1,000 shops as well as lost revenue. The enlarged business would have about 4,000 high street outlets. \u201cI believe there is widespread acceptance that the Ladbrokes board and management are not good enough and that performance over the past five years has been abysmal,\u201d he told the meeting. \u201cTotal profit before tax has declined almost 40% in that period. Had it not been for a \u00a390m increase in contribution from fixed-odds betting terminals, profits would have nearly been wiped out entirely.\u201d Desmond owns 2.8% of the company. \u201cShareholders won\u2019t need me to remind them of the decline in the Ladbrokes share price, nor the fact that peers William Hill, Betfair and Paddy Power are 91%, 100% and 300% respectively ahead over that same period. Simply put, the board and the management team have not earned the right to be entrusted with the negotiation and completion of this deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my opinion, in the end this could be a deal too far for Ladbrokes shareholders.\u201d The enlarged company intends to employ Andy Hornby, the former chief executive of HBOS and current chief operating officer of Gala Coral, in a senior role. The Ladbrokes board defended his position when asked about his role by a shareholder at the meeting. Hornby could face a ban from City regulators over his role at HBOS after a damning report into the 2008 rescue of the bank was published last week. Speaking after the meeting, Desmond said he would not give up and may call other shareholder meetings. \u201cThis is only a start,\u201d he said. One of his concerns is a \u00a375m payment to Playtech, the Ladbrokes software supplier, which he said was shared with other investors. Desmond said they were voting for the merger with Gala Coral \u201cout of a sense of frustration and resignation with the current board and management\u201d. Desmond has previously complained to the Takeover Panel, which polices takeovers, about disclosure of information.",

    "webTitle": "Rolls-Royce chief warns of senior job cuts in effort to fix engine-maker", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The new chief executive of Rolls-Royce has warned that senior job losses will form part of \u00a3200m in annual cost cuts. Warren East, who replaced John Rishton in July, said the company was so opaque and bloated that another in a string of profit warnings was possible, as he set out plans to revive the engine-maker. He said the Rolls-Royce was overburdened with managers, committees and processes to the point where it was hard to know what was going on. The company was at a \u201cturning point\u201d but there were \u201cthings that are wrong and need fixing\u201d. He acknowledged that the \u201cself-help\u201d he expected to implement would involve \u201cstreamlining senior management\u201d. Rolls-Royce has 54,000 staff worldwide, about 2,000 of whom are deemed senior managers. In a presentation to investors, East said the Derby-based company had a strong underlying business but he promised a review of its operations, improved disclosure to investors, and a simpler business that would let engineers get on with their jobs. \u201cNeither myself nor the board are under illusions about how concerned you are,\u201d added the Rolls-Royce chairman, Ian Davis. \u201cThe overwhelming priority is to improve our financial and operating performance, improve our speed and response to events and improve internal controls.\u201d East did not go into details about potential job cuts, business disposals, or exiting certain countries, but he said large layers of cumbersome bureaucracy needed to be stripped away so the company could function properly and respond to market changes. He also promised to rid Rolls of the \u201caccounting fog\u201d that made the company impenetrable to its analysts and external investors by making accounting for its TotalCare servicing contracts and research and development costs clearer. Over more than two decades Rolls became a beacon of British manufacturing excellence as one of the world\u2019s top makers of engines for aircraft, ships and industrial use. But it has issued five profit warnings in the past 18 months, including two under East as he has sought greater clarity about the business. East has stopped giving profit guidance and does not expect to restore targets for a year or more. Asked if this was because Rolls\u2019s internal accounting was too complex to analyse, he said: \u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry to be blunt but it is.\u201d There was still \u201cmud in the system\u201d that could mask problems that would trigger a further profit warning, he said, adding that he hoped that would not be the case but \u201cthe ground is not as clear as I would like it to be\u201d. Rolls is already shedding 3,600 jobs and East said more would go, including a swathe of top managers. \u201cWe are overmanaged,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about improving the effectiveness of the operation; it\u2019s not about reducing the number of engineers. We are an engineering company and the last thing I want today is less engineers. What I want to do is to make it easier for those engineers to do their jobs.\u201d East spent 10 years turning ARM Holdings into arguably Britain\u2019s top technology business, supplying microchips to Apple and other leading companies before taking on the task of turning around Rolls. As well struggling financially, Rolls is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over bribery allegations in China, Indonesia and other parts of the world. Asked how Rolls had got into such a position, East said: \u201cIt\u2019s a very valid question. If you\u2019ve got a big business with a lot of different things happening, over the years people add complexity for good reason.\u201d But his predecessors failed to remove bureaucracy as they went along, East said. Rolls was run by Sir John Rose for 15 years before Rishton took over in 2011. \u201cThe processes and procedures you wrap around an organisation to make it work [have] frankly got very bloated,\u201d he added. East said an example of too much complexity was that Rolls\u2019s 27 key technologies such as 3D printing and heat-resistant ceramics did not all need the same amount of management but that each was treated the same. They will be condensed into about eight themes, requiring fewer people and meetings, he said. Rolls, which makes engines for Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliners and Airbus\u2019s A380 superjumbos, has bet on demand for wide-bodied aircraft but the trend among regional airline operators has shifted towards single-aisle plane orders. East said Rolls could have reacted more quickly to the changing market if information from staff talking to customers had been reported more quickly to top managers. He also took aim at the government\u2019s proposed replacement of the annual \u00a3600m innovation budget with interest paying loans. He said tfor every pound of grant Rolls received it generated another \u00a317 through training and employing people and other spending. Rolls was unlikely to move great swaths of research and development abroad if the plans took effect but other countries would offer grants that would tempt the company to locate operations there, he said.",

      "bodyText": "In its letter to the Guardian (Philip Morris: we are defending our business, not attacking human rights, 19 November), Philip Morris International (PMI) claims that \u201cthe Uruguayan senate approved the investment treaty with Switzerland after careful scrutiny, and with confidence that its provisions aligned with Uruguay\u2019s domestic law\u201d, and that the country should therefore silently allow its anti-tobacco provisions to be challenged by the tobacco corporation at an international arbitration panel. Article 2 of said investment treaty clearly establishes that \u201cThe Contracting Parties recognize each other\u2019s right not to allow economic activities for reasons of public security and order, public health or morality\u2026\u201d With the lung cancer mortality rate declining 15% in Uruguay (and increasing in the rest of the world), the burden of proof should be on PMI to demonstrate that it is not a legitimate public health measure to ban the advertising of tobacco and otherwise limit its sale (all tobacco, on a non-discriminatory basis) instead of challenging the Uruguayan government\u2019s legally mandatory protection of the right to health. No proper court should ever have accepted such irresponsible litigation, which appears to be aimed at scaring others from following the example of Uruguay. But, as Alfred de Zayas rightly describes in the article to which PMI\u2019s letter was responding (How can Philip Morris sue Uruguay over its tobacco laws?, 16 November), arbitration panels in investor-states disputes are about anything but real justice. Roberto Bissio Executive director, Instituto del Tercer Mundo (Third World Institute), Montevideo, Uruguay \u2022 The only response possible to Marc Firestone, senior vice-president and general counsel of Philip Morris International (PMI), comes from Upton Sinclair: \u201cIt is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.\u201d PMI is a legal enterprise, but it is not a legitimate business. It is part of an industry that kills 6 million people across the globe annually. If current dreadful trends prevail, tobacco use will kill 1 billion people in the 21st century. Mr Firestone should count himself fortunate that, by historical accident, cigarettes are still legal products. His firm has no business interfering with the public health legislation of Uruguay or that of any other country. Stan Shatenstein Editor and publisher, STAN Bulletin (Smoking &amp; Tobacco Abstracts &amp; News) \u2022 Marc Firestone writes as though Philip Morris were a human rights NGO, not a purveyor of cigarettes. Tobacco giants brought legal action against the Australian government arguing that standardised packaging involves the seizure of intellectual property rights. This was rejected comprehensively by the high court, which found that \u201cThe arguments advanced by the tobacco companies are answered by the logically anterior conclusion that the TPP Act [introducing standardised packaging] effects no acquisition of property.\u201d The judges variously described the case of the tobacco companies as \u201cdelusive\u201d, \u201csynthetic\u201d, \u201cunreal\u201d, and suffering \u201cfatal\u201d defects in logic and reasoning. Undaunted, Philip Morris is currently suing the Australian government over its tobacco plain-packaging legislation, under a 1993 Hong Kong-Australia investment treaty.

The overall economy, as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP), grew at an annual rate of 2.1% in the July-September period, the Commerce Department reported, up from a previously estimated growth of 1.5%. Even with the revision, economic growth slowed sharply from a 3.9% gain in the second quarter when the economy was rebounding from an unusually harsh winter that had sapped first quarter growth to a barely discernible 0.6% pace. The latest revision to GDP comes as the Federal Reserve considers its first interest rate hike since 2006. The Fed chair, Janet Yellen, signalled to Congress earlier this month that a rate rise was on the table when the federal open markets committee meets next in December. The odds of a rate rise are increasing as economists forecast that a continuing rebound in the jobs market and falling gas prices will fuel consumer spending and push GDP growth in the current quarter to 2.5% or better.

    "webTitle": "Mark Carney testifies to parliament; US growth revised up - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. The US economy is growing faster than expected. Growth in the last quarter has been revised up to +2.1% (annualised) or just over 0.5% quarter-on-quarter. Analysts aren\u2019t blown away by the figures, which partly reflect inventory changes. But it may raise the chances of an interest rate rise next month. In the UK, the Bank of England has flagged up that action may be taken to calm consumer credit. In an appearance before MPs, governor Mark Carney also said that: The Bank has no plans to abolish cash. He defended chief economist Andy Haldane, who speculated in a recent speech that digital cash could be implemented so allow negative interest rates to be imposed. Politicians are putting more pressure on central banks worldwide. Carney insists that this isn\u2019t a problem in the UK, though. We\u2019ve also had mixed economic data from Germany Net trade has fallen to its lowest level in two years, dragging back growth and leaving the economy reliant on consumer spending. But businesses are increasingly confidence about future prospects, despite challenges at home and abroad The Greek government has condemned a bomb explosion in Athens overnight French tourism has taken a hit from the Paris terror attacks, with visits to the capital falling. And European stock markets are all in the red today, as investors pile into safe-havens like government bonds and gold as the Russian jet crisis deepens: Here\u2019s Capital Economic\u2019s Paul Ashworth, explaining how consumers are driving the US economy: The alternative real gross domestic income measure suggests that the economy expanded by an even stronger 3.1% annualised in the third quarter. Moreover, the disappointing 0.7% gain in real GDI in the second quarter was revised up to a much healthier 2.2%. Most of the solid third-quarter gain in incomes accrued to households, with real personal disposable income increasing by as much as 3.9% annualised. Nominal personal incomes increased by 5.1% annualised. In contrast, corporate profits declined by 1.1% last quarter, which translates into an annualised decline of roughly 4.5%. This US growth report doesn\u2019t set the world alight for investors, says Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management. However, it is another important sign that the US economy may be robust enough to handle a rate hike. She explains: Jobs figures for October smashed expectations, while consumer sentiment remains strongly upbeat. Retail figures have been a little more mixed, but this is more a reflection of a new smarter and cost conscious consumer than any fundamental economic issues. Inventory de-stocking weighed on third quarter growth, but as companies rebuild their inventories, this actually bodes well for the figures in the final quarter. \u201cAll of this has seen the Fed seemingly pencil in a rate rise next month, a vote of confidence in the US\u2019 economic stability. In fact, Yellen couldn\u2019t have been much more clear that she expects to start rate normalisation in December. We don\u2019t expect this to startle markets. Not only has it been on the cards for quite some time, but the Fed has repeatedly reassured that rate rises will be steady and incremental, rather sharp and substantial hikes.\u201d The growth uplift is also due to US companies restocking their inventories at a faster pace than expected. The Commerce Department now believes that firms bought $90bn of new supplies, now the $56.8bn first estimated. That means inventory changes only cut GDP by 0.6%, not the 1.4% first estimated. Good news - except it dampens hopes that firms would restock aggressively in the current quarter. There\u2019s not much reaction in the markets to the GDP figures. The Dow Jones industrial average is still expected to fall by over 100 point when Wall Street opens, in 40 minutes. Investors are primarily gripped by the unfolding diplomatic crisis following the downing of a Russian jet by Turkish military today: This stronger US growth could encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. The FT says Although third quarter growth remains well below the 3.9 per cent rate recorded for the second quarter, the solid numbers - fuelled by improved consumer spending - should reinforce the view among US policymakers that the economy is on a steady growth trajectory. Breaking news -- the US economy grew faster than first estimated in the last quarter. The Commerce Department has just announced that US GDP grew by 2.1% (annualised) between the start of July and the end of September. Up from an original eatimate of 1.5%. That\u2019s equates to growth of just over 0.5% during the quarter. That broadly matches the UK\u2019s own growth, and beats the eurozone\u2019s 0.3% expansion. The Commerce Department says that business investment was stronger than first thought -- rising by 2.4%, not the initial estimate of 2.1%. But consumer spending has been revised lower, to 3% from 3.2%. Observer economics editor Heather Stewart was at today\u2019s session, and reports: Bank of England policymakers may need to rein in consumer lending to prevent a borrowing bubble from emerging as the economy recovers, chief economist Andy Haldane has warned. Appearing before the cross-party Treasury select committee alongside the Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney, Haldane warned that consumer credit \u2013 in particular personal loans \u2013 was \u201cpicking up at a rate of knots\u201d. \u201cThat ultimately might be an issue that the financial policy committee (FPC) might want to look at fairly carefully,\u201d he said. The FPC, created in the wake of the financial crisis, is meant to prevent future crashes by allowing the Bank to take action to control particular markets without using the blunter tool of interest rates. The FPC has already stepped in to constrain mortgage lending; but its powers to confront a credit bubble are untested. Carney told MPs he could not say much about the FPC, as he is in \u201cpurdah\u201d as its next meeting approaches; although he confirmed that the rapid pace of credit growth was something it might need to look at..... Here\u2019s her full story: The pound fell as Carney, Haldane et al testified to MPs, and gave little indication that interest rates are going to rise soon: Today\u2019s session has highlighted the differences at the heart of the Bank of England, says Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe: Today\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee testimony showed quite clearly that the Bank of England is not unconditionally committed to maintaining loose monetary policy. Andy Haldane once again cemented his position as the most dovish MPC member, giving a very robust defence of his willingness to consider further cuts to interest rates. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that dissent in the MPC is not only acceptable, but desirable. The act that Haldane balances the risks to inflation differently to other MPC members is precisely why a committee votes on rates, as opposed to having one decision maker. If the entire MPC had the same view, there would be no point in the committee. Haldane\u2019s views do have merit and if the data begins to support them more conclusively, the rest of the MPC is bound to take notice. Finally, Andrew Tyrie wants more details about the meetings taking place between the Monetary Policy Committee and Financial Policy Committee (which Carney mentioned earlier). Q: Given the importance of these meetings, are any minutes being kept? There are two sets of minutes, governor Carney replies - one for the FPC covering financial stability issues, and one for the MPC with monetary policy points. This looks like duplication to Tyrie, who suggests the Bank considers producing just one set of minutes - ideally for public release. \u201cWe\u2019ll take a look at that\u201d, Carney agrees. And that\u2019s the end of the session. Andrew Tyrie turns the spotlight onto Andy Haldane, asking: A: Is Chris Giles [of the Financial Times] right when he says the MPC needs to take seriously the view of its chief economist Andy Haldane that interest rates even at 0.5 per cent are providing little economic stimulus? Haldane looks deliciously foxed for a moment (you can almost see him thinking \u2018when did I say THAT?\u2019). I don\u2019t recall saying that, Haldane replies, scratching his ear, and it\u2019s not really my view. But, if monetary policy was too stimulatory, you\u2019d see an economy growing faster than trend. We have an economy that is growing at trend, and slowing. And there\u2019s not much sign that pricing pressures are picking up. So can we really say that monetary policy is very loose and accommodative? [Chris Giles\u2019s piece is here: Time to ask why we are still in the era of ultra-low rates ] Kristin Forbes has picked up a hospital pass - agreeing to do some work on the precise impact that migration has on the UK economy. Good luck, professor F.... So once interest rates reach 2%, and you can pull both levers (by changing rates and QE), how will you decide which one to grasp? I long for the day that we face such higher-order questions, smiles Mark Carney. But he won\u2019t give any guidance on that issue now. [actually, this may be a problem for Carney\u2019s successor, as his term will end in summer 2018] Haldane agrees that the Bank should maintain its stock of UK government debt until interest rates have risen to \u201caround\u201d 2%, as Carney says. But, it\u2019s a guide, not a trigger. Low interest rates, and the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme, are like \u201ctwo levers\u201d pushing the economy forwards, says Gertjan Vlieghe. By acquiring new UK government debt (gilts) when they mature, we are keeping the QE programme topped up at \u00a3375bn and not pulling the lever back. Onto quantitative easing, and Carney explains that the Bank is committed to not cutting its stock of assets until interest rate have reached 2% (the point where they can be cut again). Mark Garnier MP fears for young people who are trying to get onto the housing market. They face massive debts, as they \u2018compensate\u2019 older homeowners who have benefitted from the jump in house prices over the years. Does it keep you awake at night, governor? Without question, indebted households are more vulnerable, says Carney. And the Bank is very concious that there is less margin for error, given the amount of household debt still in the UK. The Bank is monitoring a large group of households to learn the impact that a rate hike will have, he adds. Could Britain be facing a \u2018perfect storm\u2019, where new housebuyers are taking on huge debts and established homeowners are running down their savings, Garnier asks. Carney replies that consumer confidence is at its highest level since the crisis, and the Bank is watching closely in case problems are being stored up. But low rates are meant to encourage consumption. Should we be worried about a credit bubble in the UK, asks Mark Garnier MP? Andy Haldane argues that we don\u2019t have a debt-fuelled boom, yet anyway. The days of households with mortgages at five times their income are over. There are households with income multiples of three to four times, though - but a rise in wages should provide insurance for the time when rates rise Unsecured credit growth is running at 8%, much slower than before the crisis. So the housing market is picking up pace, but it\u2019s not racing away - with mortgage approvals also below the pre-crisis level. But action might be needed..... Wes Streeting then asks: What are the macro-prudential implications of the government\u2019s changes to tax credits? Carney: We always base our forecasts on decisions that have been taken. So I think we can wait another 24 hours [for the autumn statement to be delivered]. But you must have done work since the tax credit plan was announced in the July budget... We base our forecasts on the totality of fiscal policy, Carney continues, deftly passing the buck (or perhaps puck) to the Office for Budget Responsibility who does the nitty-gritty assessment. Our broad view of the UK economy is that domestic demand is quite robust, and it has to be given the fiscal consolidation and the weak global economic picture. Wes Streeting MP moves onto Britain\u2019s productivity puzzle -- will we ever recover our pre-crisis productivity rates? Carney says there is an \u2018upside risk\u2019 that productivity increases faster than the Bank expects. But here are reasons to expect lower productivity growth in the long term. Financial productivity before the crisis was partly due to unsustainable credit growth - we don\u2019t want that again. And North Sea production, and thus productivity, is likely to fall despite technological improvements. Prof Kristin Forbes also sounds confident that the UK economy is recovering, and is unlikely to require negative interest rates: Carney then launches into a long explanation into the factors that are keeping borrowing costs at record lows worldwide. He cites demographic changes, and the impact of technology on the labour market which risks \u2018hollowing out\u2019 the jobs market. Governor Carney tries to squash the debate -- perhaps fearing a panic on the streets if the public think their bank notes are to be pulped. He insists: There are no plans to abolish cash at the Bank of England. Andy Haldane was simply conducting \u201ca thought experiment with his speech on the issue, he add. As any chief economist would do. Baker plays his trump card at Andy Haldane, asking if he knows economics professor Kevin Dowd. He taught me, Haldane replies. In that case, Baker smirks, you\u2019ll appreciate this 31-page report rebutting your \u201cHow low can you go\u201d speech (in which Haldane outlines how cash could be abolished to allow negative interest rates to be imposed). He even waves it at the committee. \u201c31 pages?\u201d, Haldane blinks back. (that\u2019s your lunchtime reading sorted, Andy).. Steve Baker asks Andy Haldane about his recent claim that UK interest rates are the lowest they\u2019ve ever been. Yes, Haldane replies, I was challenged about that so we went back and looked carefully. As far as we can tell, going back to Babylonian times, we\u2019re in uncharted territory. And yet, Baker replies, you want to get even lower. You\u2019ve suggested abolishing cash, cancelling certain bank notes, in a speech. How do you think negative rates would affect the UK economy? I was not arguing for the abolition of cash, or invalidating some bank notes, Haldane replies. But it\u2019s worth thinking through the implications. It sounds a bit wacky. But 95% of all money is digital, and pays interest. The final component, the currency component -- what are the implications of digitising it to pay interest rates at good times, and negative rates in bad times? Baker: So you think we could reach a point where people are so worried to hold cash that we must pay interest rates? Not a normal situation, no, Haldane replies. But it\u2019s a theoretical possibility. Steve Baker MP asks: why is UK inflation is so low (minus 0.1% today), and forecast to stay so low, even though the Bank is running a stimulative monetary policy? Carney blames the fall in oil prices, which was much steeper than expected. Q: So you didn\u2019t think that more quantitative easing would get inflation on track? No, QE wouldn\u2019t move the oil price.... and we\u2019re looking through the current oil price weakness. Tyrie asks: Are you all saying that the next move in Bank policy might be to use the counter-cyclical tools controlled by the Financial Policy Committee, not a change in borrowing costs from the MPC? That\u2019s possible, Vlieghe replies. Jacob Rees-Mogg now asks about the suggestion that global interest rates might need to be cut from their current record lows, into negative territory. Mark Carney agrees that the \u2018equilibrium rate\u2019 is lower than in the past. However: I don\u2019t think the most likely scenario is that the equilibrium rate in the UK is negative, and that we need negative interest rates. By recent tradition, the Bank of England governor is never wrong, jokes Rees-Mogg, winning a cheeky smile from Carney..... ....and a world-weary grunt of \u201cIt has been known....\u201d from chairman Andrew Tyrie. But what would the bank do if Carney is wrong, and the Bank needs to ease policy? MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe suggests that more quantitative easing might make sense. It\u2019s not appropriate at this stage to consider abolishing cash (so negative rates could be imposed on electronic deposits). And there are big problems with \u201chelicopter money\u201d or cancelling the UK government gilts we hold, Vlieghe adds, as it would damage the Bank\u2019s credibility to fighting inflation. The Bank has just published testimony from its chief economist, Andy Haldane. In it, Haldane warns that the world economy faces \u201cheadwinds\u201d from the slowdown in emerging markets: These countries benefitted from a large inflow of capital, and a build-up of debt, in the aftermath of the crisis. Those capital flows now appear to have gone into reverse, slowing growth. I expect this \u201cthird phase\u201d of the crisis to be reasonably protracted in its impact on world growth. That is why, in my view, risks to the UK from the external environment are skewed to the downside, as they are in the Bank\u2019s latest Inflation Report projections. And Haldane also warns that monetary policy may need to be eased, not tightened, in the short term: Given the balance of risks, I have a neutral stance on the future direction of monetary policy. In my view, policy needs to be poised to move in either direction in the period ahead, depending on how the data and risks, domestic and international, play out. When rates do rise, I expect any rises to be both gradual and limited, in line with the Committee\u2019s guidance. Jacob Rees-Mogg MP asks whether there are tensions between the Bank\u2019s monetary policy arm, and its macro-prudential arm. Are they working together, or obstructing each other\u2019s goals? Excellent question, Carney replies. There have been more joint meetings between the Financial Policy Committee (responsible for financial stability) and the Monetary Policy Committee (responsible for inflation) to ensure each knows what the other is up to. In short, they\u2019re working together: [the issue here is that ultra-loose monetary policy, and record low interest rates, can encourage reckless borrowing or a bubble in the housing market.] Carney outlines how the FPC could use its \u2018counter-cyclical\u2019 tools to cool the lending market, which would effectively push up borrowing costs. And the governor then flags up that the MPC could actually raise interest rates to cool the economy: It is possible that the MPC could take monetary action for ultimately financial stability reasons.... If the view is that other macro-prudential tools are exhausted, we could use monetary policy to address macro-prudential issues. So you\u2019ve not got any examples of attempts to pressure the Bank and undermine independence, Andrew Tyrie asks. Carney confirms this is correct. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie promises us a couple of very interesting hours on monetary policy (hurrah). He starts by asking Mark Carney: is the Bank of England truly independent, or is there any \u2018back seat driving\u2019 from politicians? Carney says that the pressure on central banks has increased in recent years. That\u2019s totally appropriate, given the power they now hold. Given the burden on monetary policy since the crisis, there have been some tendencies to challenging that independence, Carney continues. Particularly in the United States, given the way the Federal Reserve is overseen. In the UK, the Bank does not have independence over its objectives. We have clear goals set by parliament, and we work within set constraints to achieve it. That \u201cconstrained discretion\u201d also applies to the new powers for financial stability that the Bank was granted in 2012 after the financial crash. And we\u2019re off.... Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, hopes that Mark Carney will provide more insight into the current state of the UK economy. He doesn\u2019t expect the governor will be bowled out by MPs: Mr Carney\u2019s reputation for handling tricky questions is well founded and these verbal jousts invariably see the Canadian coming away with his reputation enhanced. The session is being webcast live, here. Just five minutes to go until the UK parliament\u2019s Treasury committee begin questioning the Bank of England about its latest quarterly inflation report. The witnesses in the Thatcher Room are: Dr Mark Carney, Governor, Bank of England Andy Haldane, Chief Economist and Executive Director, Monetary Analysis and Statistics, Bank of England Professor Kristin Forbes, External Member, Monetary Policy Committee Dr Gertjan Vlieghe, External Member, Monetary Policy Committee The Moscow and Istanbul stock markets have both fallen sharply, after Turkey downed a Russian jet at the Syria border: Cristian Maggio, the London-based head of emerging-market research at Toronto Dominion Bank, says the incident is \u201can accident waiting to happen\u201d. He told Bloomberg: \u201cThis episode just shows that the market is heavily underestimating geopolitical risks in the region.\u201d My colleague Matt Weaver is tracking the latest developments here: German companies are increasingly confident, despite the problems stacking up at home and abroad. That\u2019s according to IFO, the Munich-based thinktank, which just reported that the Paris attacks have not dampened business optimism in Germany. IFO\u2019s business climate index has hit its highest level since June 2014, up from 108.2 last month to 109.0 for November. German bosses reported that current conditions, and future expectations, have both improved this month. That\u2019s a little curious, given scenes of terrorism in Paris, the refugee crisis, the Volkswagen scandal, and the slowdown in emerging markets that has hit German exports. The Greek government spokesman has just condemned the early morning (3:30 AM) bomb attack on the offices of the country\u2019s business federation, reports Helena Smith our correspondent in Athens. \u201cThe government denounces the bomb attack on the offices of SEV in Syntagma,\u201d said Olga Gerovasiliou, adding that its \u201cpolitical stance\u201d was one \u201cof absolute condemnation of such actions.\u201d The main opposition New Democracy party has also just condemned the \u201cterrorist attack, saying: \u201cSuch actions harm the image of the country and the real interests of Greeks. We call on the government to intensify its efforts to find and punish the perpetrators.\u201d Police are said to be very worried that this could mark an attempt at insurrection by Greek anarchists. They have been encouraged by imprisoned members of their community to launch a \u201cblack December\u201d, to restart the anarchist insurgency in and outside prisons. Reports that the Turkish military have shot down a Russian-made plane near the Syria border are weighing on the markets: The Turkish lira has taken a hit, weakening to 2.86 lira to the US dollar, from 2.845. Airline stocks are leading the fallers on the FTSE 100, with easyJet losing 3.9% and IAG (British Airways\u2019 parent company) down 3%. Hotel chains are also falling. Shares in Intercontinental Hotels are down 3.3% in London. And France\u2019s Accor hotel chain has dropped by almost 5% on the Paris bourse. That follows a reports that passenger bookings for flights arriving in Paris during the Christmas period have dropped by 13% compared to last year, following the terrorist attacks in the capital. European stock markets are all in the red this morning - with the main indices losing almost 1% in early trading. In London, the FTSE 100 is down 55 points, or 0.9%, at 6,250. And Germany\u2019s DAX dropped almost 1% at the open. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says this morning\u2019s GDP report (see here) dampened the mood in Frankfurt: It wasn\u2019t the best morning for the DAX, which fell by 110 points soon after the bell. With Germany\u2019s third quarter GDP confirmed at 0.3%, it was revealed the main drag on the country\u2019s growth was its two-year low hitting net trade, with the increasing disparity between limp exports and surging imports lopping 0.4% off of the Q3 figure. This chart from the FT highlights how German export have hit their lowest level since the last quarter of 2012. Over in Greece, relief that Athens will get a \u20ac2bn bailout payment has been overshadowed by a bomb explosion near Syntagma Square, the site of the capital\u2019s parliament. A device went off outside the offices of the Hellenic Business Federation around 3.30am local time. No-one was injured. Police believe it was carried out by domestic guerrilla groups, according to the Kathimerini newspaper. They have carried out similar attacks before - but this is the first bomb since Alexis Tsipras came to power in January. Police forensic experts have been searching for evidence: Here\u2019s another worrying sign - German companies aren\u2019t investing as much on new machinery and factories. Today\u2019s GDP report shows that plant and equipment spending shrank by 0.8% in the last quarter. And gross capital formation (the amount companies spent on investment and stocking their inventories) shank by 0.3%. That performance usually only happens when Germany\u2019s economy is shrinking, according to economist Clays Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomics. He\u2019s tweeted a chart showing how consumer spending is the main growth engine: Analysts at Credit Suisse reckon Germany\u2019s decade of export dominance could be over, as China\u2019s economy slows: Germany\u2019s economy has being dragged back by its weakest trade performance in two years. The Federal Statistics Office has just confirmed that Germany\u2019s GDP rose by just 0.3% in the July-to-September quarter, matching the initial estimate. But we now have proper detail of how the economy fared - and it\u2019s provides new evidence that Germany is suffering from the slowdown in emerging economies. Exports rose by just 0.2% quarter-on-quarter, compared to estimates of a 0.4% rise. Imports, though, jumped by 1.1%. And the resulting net trade deficit wiped 0.4% of Germany\u2019s growth rate -- the weakest since 2013. Europe\u2019s powerhouse economy was left relying on domestic spending. Private consumption rose by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, as German shoppers dipped into their wallets and purses. And government spending rose by 1.3% - the biggest increase since early 2009 An official at the Statistics Office explains (via Reuters): \u201cOf course, the refugee costs are playing a role here. These are the first effects on state spending.\u201d The jump in imports may cheer commentators who argue that Germany needs to spend more to help the eurozone economy recover. But weaker exports highlight renewed weakness in developing markets.... Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up... Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is testifying to parliament today from 10am GMT. He\u2019ll be quizzed on his view of the UK economy, after the Bank cut its growth and inflation forecasts two weeks ago - and indicated interest rates may not rise for another year. Carney will be accompanied by chief economist Andy Haldane, and independent rate-setters Gertjan Vlieghe and Kristin Forbes. Perhaps MPs could ask Haldane to elaborate on his thoughts about smart robots, which could eventually take over one in two UK jobs... We also get fresh estimates of German economic growth in the third quarter of 2015 this morning. Then at 1.30pm GMT, the second estimate of US GDP for the last quarter is released. Economists expect an growth upgrade, from an annualised rate of 1.4% to over 2%. We\u2019ll also be tracking the commodities markets, after copper hit a 6.5 year low yesterday. Rolls-Royce could be interesting - the engine maker is outlining a new strategy, to tackle (it hopes) a big drop in demand. European stock markets are expected to dip at the start of trading, after an unenthusiastic session in Asia. We\u2019ll be tracking all the events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Bank of England policymakers may need to take action to prevent a risky consumer borrowing binge as the economy recovers, the bank\u2019s chief economist has warned. Appearing before the cross-party Treasury select committee alongside the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, Andy Haldane warned that consumer credit, in particular personal loans, had been \u201cpicking up at a rate of knots. That ultimately might be an issue that the financial policy committee [FPC] might want to look at fairly carefully.\u201d The Financial Policy Committee (FPC), created after the financial crisis, is meant to prevent a future crash by allowing the Bank to take action in particular markets without using the blunter tool of interest rates. Chaired by the governor, it has 10 members \u2013 but does not include Haldane. The FPC has already stepped in to constrain mortgage lending but its powers to confront a credit bubble are untested. The latest data from the Bank showed the rate of growth of consumer credit picking up sharply. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said: \u201cThe FPC has huge new powers which only small numbers of the public have so far been aware of, and it is particularly important that we hold them accountable. Many of these decisions were formerly the preserve of politicians.\u201d Carney told MPs he was limited as to how much he could say about the FPC, as he was in \u201cpurdah\u201d, as its next meeting approached; but he confirmed the rapid pace of credit growth was something it might need to look at. He added that the separate monetary policy committee (MPC), which sets interest rates, has to take into account the historically high debt levels of Britain\u2019s households as it made interest rate decisions. \u201cWithout question, more indebted households are more vulnerable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pressure on households because of the debt burden is significant. There is less margin for error.\u201d However, the governor also reiterated that he believed the moment for raising interest rates was approaching. \u201cThe question in my mind is when is the right time for interest rates to increase,\u201d he said. Carney was supported by an independent MPC member, the American economist Kristin Forbes, who has previously taken a hawkish stance. Forbes said the jobs market, which the Bank has been watching closely for signs that wage inflation was emerging, appeared to be improving. \u201cA number of measures we look at are back to pre-crisis levels. All in all, the evidence is of quite a tight labour market,\u201d she said. The governor has stressed that the decision about whether to tighten monetary policy is likely to \u201ccome into sharper relief\u201d at the turn of the year. While just one MPC member, Ian McCafferty, has so far voted for higher borrowing costs, a widely anticipated rate rise by the US Federal Reserve in December is expected to open the way for higher UK rates. However, the hearing also underlined the divisions about the shape of the economy within the Bank, with Haldane presenting written testimony underlining his judgment that interest rates are as likely to move down as up. \u201cGiven the balance of risks, I have a neutral stance on the future direction of monetary policy. In my view, policy needs to be poised to move in either direction in the period ahead, depending on how the data and risks, domestic and international, play out.\u201d Carney also rejected the idea Haldane discussed in a recent speech, of abolishing physical cash at some point in the future, to allow interest rates to be made negative. When MP Steve Baker raised the issue, the governor, who referred to his colleague throughout as \u201cMr Haldane\u201d, said: \u201cJust to be clear, there are no plans to abolish cash at the Bank of England. As Mr Haldane just said, it was a thought experiment.\u201d Asked whether, as Haldane suggested, rates might have to fall further from their record low of 0.5%, Mark Carney made clear he did not believe that was a \u201clikely scenario\u201d. Gertjan Vlieghe, the new independent member of the MPC, expressed scepticism about the idea that fresh measures \u2013 such as direct cash transfers to consumers, known as \u201chelicopter money\u201d \u2013 might be needed to stimulate the economy. \u201cI do think there are really big problems with helicopter money, because essentially it\u2019s stating that we\u2019ve abandoned our inflation target,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Black Friday is here to stay because British shoppers expect to be able to buy heavily discounted items before Christmas, according to the boss of AO.Com, the online electrical goods retailer. Announcing AO\u2019s first-half results, John Roberts said he expected the US-inspired discount day, which takes place on 27 November, to be bigger than last year. \u201cExact demand and volumes nobody knows, but it feels like the frenzy is definitely bigger this year,\u201d he added. However, he said he did not expect theevent to create any extra sales of appliances and televisions over the year as whole. \u201cLast year was a brilliant experience for us, we just didn\u2019t make any money out of it,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt is an opportunity for us to reach lots of customers and we are all about channel shift [to the internet]. You didn\u2019t see any customers of ours getting punched in the face while trying to buy a TV.\u201d Roberts said he hoped the forthcoming event would be profitable for AO as the company had spent a year planning with suppliers to ensure efficient operations. \u201cWe start everything with the consumers and they are telling us that they love Black Friday and they vote for it with their credit cards. The genie is firmly out of the bottle and customers will vote for it. We have planned for it to be busier than last year.\u201d AO is under pressure to improve its bottom line after revealing a slump into the red as a result of set-up costs in Germany. The company made an underlying loss of \u00a34.5m in the six months to 30 September compared with a \u00a37.3m profit for the same period a year before. That was despite a 21.7% rise in revenues to \u00a3264.3m. Roberts said he was pleased with progress in Germany and that the experience there had given AO the confidence to move into the Netherlands, its second market in mainland Europe in spring next year. Black Friday is here to stay because British shoppers now expect to be able to buy heavily discounted items before Christmas, according to the boss of AO.Com, the online electrical goods retailer. AO had record sales on Black Friday last year but Roberts admitted in February that the event had condensed sales into a shorter time period without increasing them overall. The effect helped trigger a profit warning that AO\u2019s shares have yet to recover from, after it floated in February 2014 amid a flurry of interest in online retailers. UK shoppers are expected to spend up to \u00a32bn on Black Friday, a record for a single day and up from \u00a31.75bn last year, Visa said. Big retailers are increasingly having misgivings about the imported US event because the chaotic surge in buying \u2013 which caused pandemonium in stores and crashed websites \u2013 does not appear to have much impact on overall sales. \u201cIf you look at it across the quarter it will probably be about the same retail spend in the categories we are in but it\u2019s an amazing opportunity for hard-pressed consumers to stock up with Christmas presents ahead of the peak Christmas period.\u201d Asda, which claims to have imported the event from its US parent Walmart, plans to keep a low profile on Black Friday after fights broke out between bargain hunters at its shops last year. John Lewis is participating but has warned that growth of the event is against retailers\u2019 interests. Argos, which has said Black Friday makes trading unpredictable, is trying to spread its offers across the Fridays in November although it has angered shoppers with website failures. Roberts said Black Friday was better for online shopping instead of going to the shops because customers can compare prices and avoid the fraught atmosphere in stores. \u201cAsda suffered last year with a lot of ugly scenes. As an environment in store it could be dangerous for their staff and it could be dangerous for their customers,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a concept, it\u2019s more suited to online than in store.\u201d Roberts said after a slow start to the year sales picked up in the UK and that AO traded well in recent weeks. Business in Germany was stronger than expected as shoppers in Europe\u2019s biggest economy warmed to buying appliances online. AO would invest heavily in marketing to keep momentum going, he said. AO shares fell by 10% to 146.5p on Tuesday morning. The shares have lost more than half their value since February\u2019s profit warning.",

    "webTitle": "Falkland Islands oil firms announce deal after Argentina election", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Two Falkland Islands oil exploration firms have announced a \u00a357m deal just hours after Argentina elected a leader with a milder attitude towards the territorial dispute with Britain over the islands. If the deal goes ahead, it will bring together two companies that have suffered some of the most precipitous declines in stock market value in recent years. Rockhopper Exploration said it had agreed an all-share takeover of Falklands Oil &amp; Gas (FOGL) that values the target company at \u00a357m. The combined firm would own the largest oil exploration licence in the offshore area north of the Falklands, where an expected oil bonanza has so far failed to materialise. The Falklands were once seen as the next frontier for major oil discoveries, but excitement has fizzled out as well after well came up dry or not commercially viable. The disappointment prompted shares in Rockhopper to slump 93% from a peak of \u00a35.10 in September 2010 to just 35p. FOGL has plunged even further, down from \u00a32.43 in July 2010 to less than 10p on Monday, a slide of 96%. Rockhopper was worth more than \u00a31.3bn at its peak but has since declined to a little more than \u00a3100m, while FOGL\u2019s stock market value has fallen from \u00a3350m to \u00a350m. Rockhopper\u2019s chairman, Pierre Jungels, said that by coming together, the two firms had a better chance of making a commercial success out of their presence in the rough south Atlantic waters. He said the deal would \u201cadd further momentum to the ongoing work to progress the development of discovered resources in the area towards commerciality\u201d. The takeover was announced within 24 hours of businessman Mauricio Macri being elected as president in Argentina. Outgoing president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner was a bitter and vocal critic of the UK claim over the Falklands. Her administration threatened earlier this year to prosecute British firms seeking to extract oil in the disputed area. But Macri has taken a more conciliatory tone, and his victory has been seen as a positive for foreign firms struggling with Argentina\u2019s difficult business climate. Sources close to the deal said it was \u201cnot unhelpful\u201d that Kirchner was leaving but added that the takeover was triggered more by FOGL\u2019s lack of success with its Humpback well. Success would have sent FOGL\u2019s share price soaring and the disappointing result allowed the two firms \u2013 which are already partners in a number of wells \u2013 to proceed with a tie-up. Premier Oil owns 60% of Rockhopper\u2019s licences in the Sea Lion area, an arrangement that adds complexity for firms looking at a potential \u201cfarm-in\u201d, where a company takes part in exploration and shares costs with the licence holder. Rockhopper and FOGL hope that by tidying up ownership of licences in the north Falklands, they can better attract farm-in partners to develop Sea Lion and other prospects. They said the enlarged group would have \u201csignificantly more strategic influence over the pace and direction of oil and gas development in the North Falkland Basin than they would have as two stand-alone entities\u201d. The takeover values FOGL at \u00a357m, an 11% premium to its Monday closing price. Rockhopper investors will own 65% of the combined company.",

    "webTitle": "Bankers still overpaid, says German bank chief", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bankers still earn too much for simply turning up to work to handle other people\u2019s money, according to John Cryan, the joint boss of Deutsche Bank. British-born Cryan, who took over as the co-chief executive of Germany\u2019s biggest bank in July, included his own pay deal in his criticism of rewards more akin to those earned by self-made tycoons. He also said that, seven years after the financial meltdown, traders were rewarded too quickly for profits that could evaporate. \u201cMany people in the sector still believe they should be paid entrepreneurial wages for turning up to work with a regular salary, a pension and probably a healthcare scheme and playing with other people\u2019s money,\u201d Cryan said at a conference in Frankfurt on Monday. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be anything entrepreneurial about that except the compensation structures,\u201d he added, according to Bloomberg News. Cryan made his comments weeks after warning that staff bonuses must reflect the cost of Deutsche Bank\u2019s fines for past misconduct and as bankers plot to extract the biggest payout from their firms in the new-year bonus round. Traders, in particular, are still paid for short-term profits that are subject to clawback if their deals go awry. \u201cWe should reflect on people\u2019s contribution over a much longer period of time than one year,\u201d he said, adding that there is a \u201cpromise to pay first and then be in the ridiculous position where the baby\u2019s been given the candy and you\u2019ve got the difficulty of taking it away\u201d. Jason Kennedy, who heads the recruitment firm Kennedy Group in London, said Cryan\u2019s remarks were a warning shot to staff. \u201cWith continuous and unforeseen fines, their first priority is to build capital rather than pay their employees. By saying what he\u2019s said, Christmas has been cancelled,\u201d he told Bloomberg. Deutsche Bank does not intend to pay a dividend this year or next year and is reported to be planning cuts of at least 8,000 jobs in the coming years. The bank warned in October that it would lose more than \u20ac6bn (\u00a34.4bn) \u2013 a record loss \u2013 in the third quarter of its financial year because of large impairment charges. The bank also set aside \u20ac1.2bn for litigation costs. Like other banks, Deutsche was caught up in the Libor-rigging scandal and it faces a separate investigation in Switzerland for alleged price fixing in the precious metal market. Deutsche Bank has not disclosed its pay deal for Cryan, who was an investment banker at SG Warburg and UBS for 24 years before leaving UBS in 2011. Pay for his predecessor Anshun Jain and co-chief executive Juergen Fitschen fell 11% in 2014 but was still a hefty \u20ac6.66m. Cryan said he doubted whether people worked that much harder for the promise of a bonus and included himself in that group. \u201cI have no idea why I was offered a contract with a bonus in it because I promise you I will not work any harder or any less hard in any year, in any day because someone is going to pay me more or less.\u201d He added: \u201cI sit on trading floors and wonder what drives people. I don\u2019t fully empathise with anyone who says they turn up to work and work harder because they can be paid a little bit more, but that may be a personal view. I\u2019ve never been able to understand the way additional excess riches drive people to behave differently.\u201d Banks also have too many employees with grand titles such as managing director, Cryan said. \u201cThere is some value to carrying a fancy card if you are a banker because it is true that you get a better quality meeting with a client if you sound grand,\u201d he said, adding that for traders, their ability and not their title is important. \u201cThe title is never used in the context of the day-to-day business.\u201d",

Traders, in particular, are still paid for short-term profits that are subject to clawback if their deals go awry.</p> <p>\u201cWe should reflect on people\u2019s contribution over a much longer period of time than one year,\u201d he said, adding that there is a \u201cpromise to pay first and then be in the ridiculous position where the baby\u2019s been given the candy and you\u2019ve got the difficulty of taking it away\u201d.</p> <p>Jason Kennedy, who heads the recruitment firm Kennedy Group in London, said Cryan\u2019s remarks were a warning shot to staff. \u201cWith continuous and unforeseen fines, their first priority is to build capital rather than pay their employees. By saying what he\u2019s said, Christmas has been cancelled,\u201d he told Bloomberg.</p> <p>Deutsche Bank does not intend to pay a dividend this year or next year and is <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-07/deutsche-bank-bracing-for-7-billion-loss-mulls-zero-dividend\">reported to be planning cuts of at least 8,000 jobs</a> in the coming years.<br></p> <p>The bank <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/08/deutsche-bank-shocks-with-warning-of-6bn-euro-losses\">warned in October that it would lose more than \u20ac6bn</a> (\u00a34.4bn) \u2013 a record loss \u2013 in the third quarter of its financial year because of large impairment charges. The bank also set aside \u20ac1.2bn for litigation costs. Like other banks, Deutsche was caught up in the Libor-rigging scandal and it faces a separate investigation in Switzerland for alleged price fixing in the precious metal market.</p> <p>Deutsche Bank has not disclosed its pay deal for Cryan, who was an investment banker at SG Warburg and UBS for 24 years before leaving UBS in 2011. Pay for his predecessor Anshun Jain and co-chief executive Juergen Fitschen fell 11% in 2014 but was still a hefty \u20ac6.66m. </p> <p>Cryan said he doubted whether people worked that much harder for the promise of a bonus and included himself in that group. \u201cI have no idea why I was offered a contract with a bonus in it because I promise you I will not work any harder or any less hard in any year, in any day because someone is going to pay me more or less.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI sit on trading floors and wonder what drives people. I don\u2019t fully empathise with anyone who says they turn up to work and work harder because they can be paid a little bit more, but that may be a personal view. I\u2019ve never been able to understand the way additional excess riches drive people to behave differently.\u201d<br></p> <p>Banks also have too many employees with grand titles such as managing director, Cryan said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is some value to carrying a fancy card if you are a banker because it is true that you get a better quality meeting with a client if you sound grand,\u201d he said, adding that for traders, their ability and not their title is important. \u201cThe title is never used in the context of the day-to-day business.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "Treasury officials have cut Australia\u2019s economic growth forecast and predicted that the federal budget will remain in deficit for longer than previously thought. The Treasury deputy secretary, Nigel Ray, said potential growth would be about 2.75% over the next few years, as slower population growth and fewer hours being worked across the economy took their toll. The figure trims 0.25% from the 3% forecast in the May budget when it was predicted that Australia would return to surplus in 2019-20. \u201cIt is reasonable to conclude that the changes to population and hours worked \u2026 would, everything else equal, lower the path of the projected underlying cash balance,\u201d he told an Australian Business Economists\u2019 lunch on Tuesday. His comments came as the price of iron ore \u2013 Australia\u2019s biggest export earner \u2013 plunged to a 10-year low on Tuesday, potentially shaving billions more off federal revenues. The steel-making commodity is now worth less than $45 a tonne, well below the $60 used by Joe Hockey to calculate the budget forecasts in the mid-year economic forecast outlook last December. Commodity prices, especially industrial metals, have fallen sharply owing to falling demand from China and the higher US dollar. But some forecasters believe iron ore, which brings in billions to the federal coffers, could fall below $40 a tonne. Hockey said this year that if the price fell to $35 a tonne it would cost the government $25bn over four years. The prospect of slower economic growth has forced the Treasury to revise their thinking before the new treasurer Scott Morrison\u2019s Myefo statement in December. Ray said Australia had recorded its third straight year of below trend growth in 2014-15. \u201cWe are now four years on from the peak in the terms of trade, and while the ramp-up in mining export volumes is supporting output growth, other sources of domestic demand are not entirely filling the hole left by the steep falls in mining investment,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, the latest national accounts showed that the economy recorded its third straight year of below trend growth in 2014-15. This means Australia is now in a prolonged period of below-par growth, the likes of which we have rarely seen outside of a recession. \u201cNotwithstanding solid employment gains in October, the unemployment rate remains higher than our estimate ... And broader labour market measures still point to significant spare capacity in the labour market.\u201d The growth in the working-age population had slowed to 1.5%, well below the budget assumption of 1.75% and well below its average growth over the past 10 years, Ray said. \u201cThis has immediate and unavoidable consequences for the economy\u2019s potential: fewer people means a smaller supply of employees. So for a given capital stock and level of productivity, we can now produce less output overall than we previously estimated.\u201d Morrison said earlier on Tuesday that he wanted the mid-year outlook to show a realistic outlook for growth. \u201cWe will keep moving towards a surplus and that will take as long as necessary \u2026 but we will do that by controlling expenditure and growing the economy and not by raising taxes,\u201d he told ABC television.",
