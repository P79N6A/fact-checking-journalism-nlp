      "bodyText": "Tesco\u2019s restructuring plan may have gone down well with the City, but the view from Dartford in Kent was more hostile. After 11 years of pressure from Tesco to let it build an 86,000sq ft store in the town centre, the company announced that it was cancelling the plan. It was meant to be the centrepiece of Dartford\u2019s redevelopment, alongside proposals by the retail guru Mary Portas to revive the once thriving market town. The supermarket group changed its plans four times before demolition work on the site started last year. Locals said Tesco spent more than a decade putting pressure on store owners to sell and trying to ram its plans through against local opposition. One side of Lowfield Street, just off Market Street in the town centre, is almost wholly owned by Tesco. The signs of former independent shops such as the Dartford Cobbler, Chop Till You Drop hairdressers and BA Home Furnishings are still visible. Below them, across the former shop windows, are Tesco-commissioned hoardings saying \u201cMerry Christmas and a happy new year\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s starting\u201d and \u201cOur investment in Dartford town centre is under way\u201d. Tesco put the signs up before Christmas when the council complained about the dilapidated condition of the boarded up stores. One of the few remaining shops is A1 Clearance, which has sold items from cleared homes for 15 years. The business\u2019s owner, Tony Jewett, said: \u201cIt\u2019s ruined us. We don\u2019t get anyone coming to Dartford now because Tesco closed all the car parks [on the site]. It\u2019s going to leave Dartford in the doldrums.\u201d Jewett said he hoped to move into a new shop once Tesco\u2019s redevelopment took place but now he will hang on for as long as possible before claiming unemployment benefit for the first time in his life. Ray Richardson\u2019s family had a butcher\u2019s on Lowfield Street for 104 years before he sold to Tesco last year. His opposition to the scheme had become pointless as the threat of compulsory purchase hanging over the street pushed other store owners to sell up around him. \u201cI think they are incompetent. It\u2019s not surprising the company is in the state it is,\u201d he said. Richardson said he spent \u00a360,000 on surveyors, a barrister and other costs dealing with Tesco and trying to block the supermarket\u2019s proposals. In the end, he was happy with the price he got for his shop, though he is not allowed to disclose it under the terms of the agreement. Tradesmen partly blame Dartford council for sacrificing independent traders and believing Tesco\u2019s assurances that it wanted to help redevelop Dartford and build 100 new homes. The council also came in for criticism for its use of \u00a380,000 of government funding as a Portas pilot. Jeremy Kite, the Conservative leader of the council, described Tesco\u2019s behaviour as a scandal. \u201cMy view is Tesco is a toxic brand for Dartford. I regret it was Tesco who walked into my office and not someone else. I wish they would just sell the land and let someone else do something with it.\u201d Tesco\u2019s looming presence in Dartford has stymied development because it deterred other retailers that considered opening in the town, Kite said. \u201cThere has been a lot of pressure on housing in the last decade and I have no doubt a residential developer would have acquired the properties on Lowfield Street.\u201d Kite said the government needed to take action to stop retailers like Tesco building pressure in favour of their planning application by gradually acquiring property in the area. Ray Hussein moved his dry-cleaning shop to the other side of Lowfield Street eight years ago after 30 years of trading. The business is still doing OK, he says, but he has no time for Tesco. \u201cEverybody was looking forward to Tesco redeveloping but now they\u2019ve pissed off. It\u2019s all bad. It\u2019s all bad.\u201d",

They bought the site in 2006 for \u00a3160m from a consortium of train operating companies which set thetrainline.com up as a standalone business in 1999.</p> <p>It dominates the market for British train ticket sales, with 90% of third-party online bookings and around of a third of all sales including train operators\u2019 own websites.</p> <p>Clare Gilmartin, Trainline\u2019s chief executive officer, said: \u201cWe\u2019re in an era when there is strong structural growth. We sit at the heart of that, we\u2019re a technology company and bring together all of the 22 train comianies and ticket types. We save people money if they book online and in advance and now we\u2019re bringing etickets and mobile tickets to the market: all that leads to an acceleration in sales growth. We\u2019ve seen it in particular over the last quarter \u2013 up 16%.\u201d</p> <p>Revenue from rail ticket sales <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/dec/31/rail-season-ticket-prices-rmt-rise-fares\" title=\"\">has increased each year</a> in the UK since 2003 as passenger numbers have increased and fares have risen ahead of inflation. According to industry estimates, the total value of rail fares in 2014 reached \u00a39bn. Official forecasts see more passengers on trains through modal shift in transport and an increasing population, as well as large investment in new track and trains ahead.</p> <p>The company recorded ticket sales of \u00a3978m in 2014, on which it earns a 5% commission, plus it levies a charge of around \u00a31 on bookings. Gilmartin denied that the charge, which is not levied by other websites, was deterring consumers. \u201cOur fees vary. Customers vote with their feet, our share has been accelerating. We deliver things like live travel info and platform information that is tough to find elsewhere, we pull together all of the train companies and are independent so consumers trust us to get the right ticket.\u201d</p> <p>Gilmartin, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10137939/Monday-Interview-eBays-Europe-boss-Clare-Gilmartin.html\" title=\"\">a former executive at eBay</a> where she focused on the transition from desktop to mobile, says the new devices, apps and mobile ticketing will drive similar growth.</p> <p>European expansion will be the next big goal. Trainline has set up an international business focused primarily on rail journeys crossing national borders, with deals in place with Deutschebahn and Trenitalia. But Gilmartin said there is still more growth potential in the UK business, beyond the boost provided by rising passenger numbers and rail fares: \u201cIn UK rail, 24% in value terms is bought online which lags behind some European markets, so we see significant upside still in migrating rail spend online.\u201d</p>", 
      "bodyText": "Rail booking website thetrainline.com is planning to float on the London Stock Exchange with a potential valuation of \u00a3500m. The company, the UK\u2019s biggest online rail ticket site, has previously toyed with the idea of a sale but now aims to raise \u00a375m with an initial public offering next month. Trainline Investments Holdings is owned by three private equity firms \u2013 Exponent, HarbourVest Partners and Northwestern Mutual Life Assurance \u2013 who will sell off around 25% of their shares in the IPO. They bought the site in 2006 for \u00a3160m from a consortium of train operating companies which set thetrainline.com up as a standalone business in 1999. It dominates the market for British train ticket sales, with 90% of third-party online bookings and around of a third of all sales including train operators\u2019 own websites. Clare Gilmartin, Trainline\u2019s chief executive officer, said: \u201cWe\u2019re in an era when there is strong structural growth. We sit at the heart of that, we\u2019re a technology company and bring together all of the 22 train comianies and ticket types. We save people money if they book online and in advance and now we\u2019re bringing etickets and mobile tickets to the market: all that leads to an acceleration in sales growth. We\u2019ve seen it in particular over the last quarter \u2013 up 16%.\u201d Revenue from rail ticket sales has increased each year in the UK since 2003 as passenger numbers have increased and fares have risen ahead of inflation. According to industry estimates, the total value of rail fares in 2014 reached \u00a39bn. Official forecasts see more passengers on trains through modal shift in transport and an increasing population, as well as large investment in new track and trains ahead. The company recorded ticket sales of \u00a3978m in 2014, on which it earns a 5% commission, plus it levies a charge of around \u00a31 on bookings. Gilmartin denied that the charge, which is not levied by other websites, was deterring consumers. \u201cOur fees vary. Customers vote with their feet, our share has been accelerating. We deliver things like live travel info and platform information that is tough to find elsewhere, we pull together all of the train companies and are independent so consumers trust us to get the right ticket.\u201d Gilmartin, a former executive at eBay where she focused on the transition from desktop to mobile, says the new devices, apps and mobile ticketing will drive similar growth. European expansion will be the next big goal. Trainline has set up an international business focused primarily on rail journeys crossing national borders, with deals in place with Deutschebahn and Trenitalia. But Gilmartin said there is still more growth potential in the UK business, beyond the boost provided by rising passenger numbers and rail fares: \u201cIn UK rail, 24% in value terms is bought online which lags behind some European markets, so we see significant upside still in migrating rail spend online.\u201d",

I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Ricketts. The new campaign would not tempt him to abandon his other regular grocery haunt, he continued. \u201cIt won\u2019t make me shop here more. I think Iceland is cheaper.\u201d While some of the Tesco cuts are quite eye-catching \u2013 with the price of favourites such as Heinz baked beans and Birds Eye fish fingers down by half to 50p and \u00a31.50 respectively \u2013 others look underwhelming. Despite the big signs beside it, Shredded Wheat is down by just 11p to \u00a32.18, for example, and a 12-pack of Diet Coke down by 20p to \u00a33.55. Jammie Dodgers have a big label flagging their price at 45p, without mentioning if this is a price cut or just their regular cost. Victoria, a regular customer who did not want to give her surname, said she liked Tesco because its own-label food was cheap but that she still did about half of her grocery shopping at Lidl. She said she had not had enough time to really analyse the latest price cuts, but added: \u201cThey do need to cut prices here. I\u2019ll be tempted to buy more in Lidl if they don\u2019t.\u201d Another shopper with an insider\u2019s perspective was stocking up after completing his night shift stacking shelves at a rival chain. He insisted he only shopped in Tesco because it was close to his home so he could walk home with his groceries. \u201cWe\u2019ve dropped our prices and are matching them. Whether I save 50p or \u00a31 I don\u2019t worry about it; it\u2019s convenience that matters to me.\u201d Asked why he thought Tesco was cutting prices, he replied: \u201cThey\u2019re desperate aren\u2019t they? All the supermarkets are desperate. Christmas wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d",

The shares have jumped first thing, with Tesco playing down rights issue fears and announcing the eye-catching recruitment of Halfords CEO Matt Davies as Tesco UK boss. The focus of the analysts meeting will be on the actions it is taking on its heavily indebted balance sheet, but we can\u2019t see anything about the expected big UK property write-downs and, handicapped by its massive over-exposure to the hypermarket business, and with the credit rating agencies breathing down its neck, we wonder whether the eventual verdict of the City on today\u2019s Tesco news will be \u201ctoo little too late\u201d. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at Finspreads.com Tesco has this morning bitten the bullet and taken the plunge in a big push to turn around its fortunes in the face of declining market share and persistent sales slippage. Like its rival Sainsbury, which reported Christmas sales yesterday, the UK\u2019s largest supermarket chain in terms of annual sales claims already announced measures introduced during its calamitous 2014, are already turning the tide because whilst it still reported declining sales, the rate of their fall has slowed. Tesco on Thursday said same-store sales, excluding petrol, fell 2.9% in the 19 weeks to January 3, better than most analysts\u2019 predictions and a significant improvement on a decline of 5.4% in the second quarter. Christmas-specific sales at the retailer \u2014 made up of the most recent six weeks \u2014 fell 0.3%. The better-than-expected sales slowdown is being eclipsed somewhat this morning by a raft of measures announced by the supermarket to return revenue growth to the strength seen in years past and stabilise its balance sheet, which notably contains areas which appear to present risks of write downs and total debt that has become a potentially crippling compared to its total market value. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers Tesco has delivered ground floor numbers against basement expectations.

Tesco\u2019s former ability to exert pressure on its rivals, particularly through pricing, seems to be slowly returning, whilst its established online and convenience store offerings should leave the company well positioned to hit back at the competition. Phil Dorrell, director of the retail consultancy Retail Remedy For a man parachuted onto the bridge of a sinking ship, Dave Lewis has set about the task of plugging the leaks with aplomb. After a 2014 that was little short of disastrous, the Tesco supertanker was holed below the waterline.

What\u2019s really interesting is that Dave Lewis talks about the value of listening to customers, but all the major changes detailed so far are focused on saving money and selling non-core assets.

Chris White, Head of UK Equities at Premier Asset Management comments: Whilst there is no quick fix at Tesco, there enough in this statement to suggest that Tesco has started to stop the rot in the UK.

      "body": "<p>Peter Thiel has never shied away from investing in companies so experimental that they\u2019re too new to even be part of an industry. <br></p> <p>So it\u2019s hardly surprising that Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund has become the first institutional investor to make an investment in the nascent cannabis industry \u2013 a business that isn\u2019t even legal in half of the states in the country. <br></p> <p>This morning, Founders Fund confirmed the buzz that has been circulating for several weeks: partner Geoff Lewis is leading an effort to take a minority stake in Privateer Holdings, the Seattle-based company that owns <a href=\"http://www.leafly.com/\">Leafly.com</a>. For those who haven\u2019t heard of it, Leafly is like Yelp for pot and medical marijuana buyers looking for reviews and price information. Privateer also controls a Canadian medical marijuana growing operation, Tilray, and other cannabis ventures. </p> <p>Founders Fund is not disclosing the terms.

      "bodyText": "Peter Thiel has never shied away from investing in companies so experimental that they\u2019re too new to even be part of an industry. So it\u2019s hardly surprising that Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund has become the first institutional investor to make an investment in the nascent cannabis industry \u2013 a business that isn\u2019t even legal in half of the states in the country. This morning, Founders Fund confirmed the buzz that has been circulating for several weeks: partner Geoff Lewis is leading an effort to take a minority stake in Privateer Holdings, the Seattle-based company that owns Leafly.com. For those who haven\u2019t heard of it, Leafly is like Yelp for pot and medical marijuana buyers looking for reviews and price information. Privateer also controls a Canadian medical marijuana growing operation, Tilray, and other cannabis ventures. Founders Fund is not disclosing the terms. Lewis won\u2019t discuss them either, other than to say it\u2019s a minority stake in Privateer, which hopes to turn a profit this year. As of its last public disclosure to the SEC last July, however, Privateer still was hoping to raise another $56m of the total $75m it has been seeking in its most recent funding round. Investing in the cannabis business \u2013 now legal for recreational use in only four states and the District of Columbia, and with at least some form of medical marijuana usage approved by 24 states \u2013 \u201cis just a slightly more extreme version of something we\u2019ve shown in our other investments that we\u2019re comfortable with\u201d, says Lewis. \u201cWe\u2019re fine with investing in businesses with regulatory ambiguity, because we believe that regulation follows public sentiment.\u201d More than a year has elapsed since the first polls showed Americans now clearly favor legalizing marijuana usage, with support for making medical marijuana legal reaching 80% in some surveys. \u201cThen the first retail stores opened in Colorado, and the world didn\u2019t end, and the federal government didn\u2019t step in, which they could have done,\u201d says Brendan Kennedy, co-founder and CEO of Privateer.

Indeed, at this point, Lewis figures that the biggest risk of Founders Fund\u2019s latest investment is pretty prosaic: can Privateer\u2019s founders execute their vision of transforming their company into the world\u2019s first cannabis conglomerate? Having studied the industry, and Privateer, for about 18 months before deciding to forge ahead, Lewis is optimistic. \u201cAt this point, we don\u2019t think there is any other company in Privateer\u2019s league.

Privateer is hoping that it will have an edge here, at least. If there is one figure closely identified with cannabis, it\u2019s probably the late reggae legend Bob Marley \u2013 and late last year, Privateer signed a 30-year agreement to use his name on what is likely to be the world\u2019s first global marijuana brand, Marley Natural.

It\u2019s a frantic programme, no argument. Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s would-be turnaround king, has been busy. The measures make sense in themselves. It is only corporate ego, for example, that has prevented Tesco from closing unprofitable stores where there is no prospect of improvement. That is a good taboo for an outsider to break. Take a step back from the display of fireworks, however, and you realise how severely Tesco has lost its competitive edge over the last half-decade. Lewis\u2019s plan to cut 30% from central costs is a spectacular confession of corporate flabbiness. Hiring Matt Davies from Halfords (a company worth \u00a31bn versus Tesco\u2019s \u00a316bn) is an admission that an awful lot of retailing talent has walked out of the door over the years. And why on Earth was Tesco messing about with Blinkbox in the first place? The technology is neat but the business always looked completely unviable for an owner that lacked its own telecoms network. Lewis, then, is a back-to-basics merchant. But the process will not be quick. He is trying to undo years of corporate drift and is operating under the severe constraint of an over-stretched balance sheet and, one assumes, mighty write-downs to follow on the property portfolio. He is also trying to avoid whacking shareholders with a rights issue \u2013 though he hasn\u2019t spelled that out explicitly. Thus the price cuts for customers look underwhelming. At a first glance, they look like a case of catching up with opposition rather than setting the pace. Tesco\u2019s shares rose 9% at one point on Thursday, but also note the reaction in Sainsbury\u2019s stock \u2013 up almost 5%. The market does not smell the start of a real price war. Lewis has never pretended that a turnaround would be quick or easy. He\u2019s got a half-decent Christmas under his belt (like-for-like sales were down just 0.3% in the six-week period) though one shouldn\u2019t read too much into that: the \u201c\u00a35 off \u00a340 of shopping\u201d vouchers were flying like confetti. In short, a big job looks even bigger today. The old Tesco that terrified the competition may be half a decade away \u2013 and that\u2019s if the plan succeeds. A bad fit for M&amp;S Nice sprouts, shame about the skirts. If the Christmas story at Marks &amp; Spencer feels familiar, there was at least a twist this year. Off-trend clothing designs didn\u2019t take the rap for a \u201cdifficult\u201d quarter in which like-for-like sales fell 5.8% in general merchandise. Rather, the weather and the warehouse were blamed. It was too hot to sell jumpers in October and November and automation cocks-up struck the huge Castle Donington distribution depot in December. The explanation of events is clearly accurate. But it does feed the sense that M&amp;S is in the business of false dawns and own goals. Back in early November, at the half-year results, M&amp;S was full of cheer as general merchandise sales finally seemed to be about to turn positive. Instead, Black Friday, the retailers\u2019 self-defeating discount jamboree, threw Castle Donington into chaos. Chief executive Marc Bolland is trying the patience of some shareholders. It is now four years without sales growth in general merchandise, which was never part of the original script. And it\u2019s not as if the big warehouse is brand-new \u2013 it opened in 2013. But bosses tend to be jettisoned only when the cock-ups destroy profit expectations. Thursday\u2019s confessions prompted only a mild trim (2%, on broker Investec\u2019s forecasts) because Bolland stuck to his pledges on higher margins. Meanwhile, the food division continues to serve as a get-out-of-jail card. So the longed-for prize for 2015 and 2016 \u2013 lots of cash generation as capital expenditure falls \u2013 is still in reach, in theory.

      "bodyText": "The Grade II-listed club house and the tree-lined fairways of the Fulwell Golf Club in Middlesex might expect more midweek activity this spring as the oil price crisis triggers a wave of redundancies at a nearby business centre. Sunbury on Thames is a long way from Aberdeen but it is where BP employs more than 4,500 well-paid staff who work in almost all aspects of the company\u2019s operations both in the North Sea and around the world. BP unveiled a month ago that it was making $1bn (\u00a3660m) worth of cuts globally in response to falling crude prices and to take account for an earlier shrinking of the business as it sold off $40bn of assets to pay for the US Gulf blowout of 2010. Almost all the money is being spent on redundancies and some of those middle managers or others employed at the Sunbury offices will fear \u2013 or hope \u2013 2015 will give them more time on the manicured fairways of Fulwell and other nearby golf courses. BP has unique problems resulting from the Deepwater Horizon accident and its huge investment in Russia but it is far fromnot alone in wielding the axe \u2013 with rivals Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhilips all announcing redundancies in Scotland. A new report co-commissioned by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skill recently warned that as many as 35,000 oil- and gas-industry jobs could go in the next five years. Iain Reid, an oil analyst with BMO Capital Markets in the City, says the first question that investors want answered by oil companies at the moment is what action they are taking to counter the impact of $50-per-barrel oil.
