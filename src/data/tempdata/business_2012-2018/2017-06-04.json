      "bodyText": "HSBC is offering its employees cash bonuses of up to \u00a32,500 if they can convince a colleague to move from London to the bank\u2019s new British headquarters in Birmingham. The bank has created a special bonus scheme to encourage staff to \u201chelp us find the right people for Birmingham\u201d because it is struggling to entice enough of its staff to make the 120-mile move before its new office opens in January. Staff who manage to convince a friend to make the move to Birmingham will be rewarded with a cash bonus of between \u00a3750 and \u00a32,500 depending on the seniority of the new Midlands recruit. Britain\u2019s biggest bank has only convinced just over half of its target of 1,040 people to make the move more than two years after announcing it would switch its UK banking operations from Canary Wharf to Birmingham. The new cash bonus comes on top of the bank already attempting to sweeten the change by making its standard relocation package \u201cmore attractive\u201d with \u201csupport for housing and children\u2019s schooling\u201d. Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es, HSBC\u2019s chief executive, told reporters last week, during a visit to the bank\u2019s new 10-storey 210,000-sq-ft office building in Centenary Square: \u201cWe have had some challenges but today we are ahead of where we thought we would be, with around 53% of the roles filled.\u201d Sim\u00f5es, who took over as HSBC\u2019s chief executive in 2015, said it had proven \u201ctrickier\u201d than expected to convince some specialists, particularly in areas like marketing and communications, to make the move, which he described as \u201cquite a big task still\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve made the standard package more attractive by offering for example support for housing and children\u2019s schooling,\u201d Sim\u00f5es said. He did not mention the cash bonuses, which were later found to be offered on HSBC internal staff website. A HSBC spokesman said that despite the difficulties in convincing staff to move, the bank was convinced that its new \u00a3200m office would open on schedule. The reluctance of the bank\u2019s staff to move to the Midlands comes despite much lower house prices and a cheaper cost of living in Birmingham compared with London. According to the property prices index provided by Hometrack the average home in Birmingham costs \u00a3152,000, less than a third of the average price in London. But house prices in Birmingham are rising much faster than in the capital, with prices up 7.7% in the year to April compared to 3.5% in London. The new Birmingham office will contain HSBC\u2019s UK retail and commercial bank, which is being split from the riskier parts of the group under the government\u2019s ringfencing rules, which come into force at the start of 2019. The continuing difficulty in recruiting staff for the Birmingham office may concern the bank\u2019s official monitor, who was last year reported to have described the move as \u201ca programme in crisis\u201d. Michael Cherkasky, a lawyer who was installed as the bank\u2019s official monitor following HSBC\u2019s \u00a31.2bn fine for money laundering offences from the US in 2012, was said to have expressed concerns to executives about the lack of staff willing to make the move. He said a delay could lead to the bank\u2019s UK division lacking the ability to maintain proper money-laundering controls. HSBC, which has 16 million customers in the UK, selected Birmingham for its British headquarters partly because of its purchase of Midland Bank in 1992. About 48,000 of HSBC\u2019s 257,000 staff work in Britain. Many British banks and other businesses are trying to relocate parts of their operations out of London because of the rising cost of office space in the capital. Of the 2.2 million people employed in financial services jobs in the UK, two-thirds now work outside London, according to data from the industry lobby group TheCityUK. Financial jobs in Birmingham rose by 6.9% between 2013 and 2015, the group said. Other large financial employers in the city include Deutsche Bank, which has increased its Birmingham staff from 35 in 2007 to about 1,500 today.",

    "webTitle": "Philip Green fashion empire hit by 16% fall in profits", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green\u2019s fashion empire suffered a 16% fall in profits last year as the billionaire\u2019s Topshop-to-Miss Selfridge group struggled with difficult trading on the high street. The drop in profits caps a torrid 12 months for the Monaco-based businessman, who was hauled before MPs following the collapse of BHS, which he sold to a group led by a former bankrupt for \u00a31. Accounts for Green\u2019s holding company, Taveta Investments, show profits in the year to the end of August 2016 fell to \u00a3211m as sales dropped 2.5% to just over \u00a32bn, according to a source. The accounts are not yet available at Companies House. Taveta, which owns the Green family\u2019s Arcadia Group of companies including Miss Selfridge, Topshop, Topman and Burton, filed its accounts on 31 May \u2013 the last day before incurring a late filing fee. A spokesman for Green declined to comment and said Green would not comment either. Despite the decrease in profits, Taveta ended the year with cash reserves of \u00a3223m, which was said to be roughly the same as last year. The company did not pay a dividend. Green is said to have appointed management consultants at McKinsey to try to help him turn around Arcadia\u2019s fortunes and help the company catch up with rivals in online shopping. His spokesman declined comment about Green\u2019s use of consultants. McKinsey refused to comment. Arcadia has lost several of its top bosses recently, including TopShop managing director Mary Homer who left on Friday to run homeware group The White Company. Other executives who have departed recently include Evans boss Fiona Ross, Burton\u2019s managing director Wesley Taylor and Miss Selfridge creative director Yasmin Yusuf. The pension scheme deficit at Arcadia Group has risen to nearly \u00a31bn, according to documents recently published by MPs investigating the demise of BHS and pensions regulation. Arcadia, which has two pension schemes \u2013 one for senior executives, another for the rest of the staff \u2013 had a combined deficit of \u00a3993m in March last year on a buyout basis. That valuation is based on the likely cost of winding up the scheme and securing benefits with an insurer. Arcadia has agreed to pay a combined \u00a350m into the schemes each year, with the aim of eliminating the deficits over the next 10 years. That will increase to \u00a354.5m a year from 2019. The deal was struck soon after Green agreed to pay \u00a3363m to resolve the pension deficit at BHS, which collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs in spring 2016. MPs last year demanded that Green, who was described in parliament as a \u201cbillionaire spiv\u201d, be stripped of the knighthood he was awarded in 2006. In a fiery Commons debate, Iain Wright, the Labour MP who chairs the business select committee, said: \u201cSir Philip received his knighthood for services to retail. However, throughout the course of our inquiry, it became increasingly evident that he wasn\u2019t particularly good at retail at all.\u201d The parliamentary vote holds no legal power and the decision on whether to strip the billionaire of his title will ultimately be made by the honours forfeiture committee. The veteran Labour MP Frank Field said Green had not done enough to keep his title as concerns lingered about the \u00a3363m settlement struck between the retail tycoon and the Pensions Regulator. \u201cSir Philip Green remains on the hook,\u201d he said recently. \u201cWhen parliament comes back from the election we need to pursue the charge sheet from the Pensions Regulator against him and what the Pensions Regulator got in return. \u201cOnce we have done that, we will realise how inadequate his settlement was. He has not done enough to hold on to his knighthood.\u201d Green and his wife, Tina, are the fifth-richest couple in the UK, according to the Sunday Times Rich List even though their combined fortune dropped by \u00a3433m to \u00a32.8bn in the annual wealth ranking. The billionaire celebrated his 65th birthday with a lavish party at the Dorchester hotel with friends including Kate Moss, the Strictly Come Dancing host Tess Daly and Sports Direct\u2019s founder, Mike Ashley. In previous years, arrangements by his wife Tina included a toga party in Cyprus with entertainment from Rod Stewart and private concerts starring Robbie Williams and Stevie Wonder. This year, the big name entertainer was the magician Dynamo (Steven Frayne).",

      "bodyText": "As a computer outage in British Airways\u2019 systems caused chaos in airports last weekend, thousands of passengers faced havoc just when they were looking forward to a break. And for many who had already checked in their baggage, there was the added frustration that it was sent on to their destinations while they were still stranded. The chaos at Gatwick and Heathrow put a renewed spotlight on where passengers stand when faced with these problems. So what are your rights? When am I covered? In the case of delays, European Union law gives significant cover for flights that have departed from an airport within the EU (plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) operated by any airline, and for flights arriving at an EU airport and operated by an EU airline. What passengers can get depends on whether they are flying a short distance (less than 1,500km); medium distance (between 1,500km and 3,500km) or long distance (over 3,500km). Passengers delayed for over three hours can claim \u00a3220 for a short flight and \u00a3350 for a medium flight. For long-haul flights, it\u2019s \u00a3260 for delays between three and four hours, and \u00a3520 after that. According to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), anyone delayed for over five hours can get a refund on the flight if they don\u2019t want to fly any more. If any flight is cancelled, under EU law airlines have to provide a refund or arrange an alternative flight. The right to compensation depends on the reason for the cancellation and airlines can claim \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d such as security risk or severe weather. The consumer rights magazine Which? says it is worth challenging an airline if you don\u2019t agree with its often-used claim of \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d, for example \u201cif you\u2019re told you can\u2019t fly due to weather conditions, but other flights are departing\u201d. Frank Brehany, consumer director of HolidayTravelWatch \u2013 which helps people complain about holiday problems \u2013 says he recently dealt with a case where a flight from Toulouse to London had been cancelled. Passengers were not compensated properly as the airline claimed there had been an \u201cunexpected strike\u201d. However, because the strike had been planned in advance, passengers received full compensation. When am I not covered? You cannot rely on EU regulations when flying into Britain from outside the EU on non-European airlines \u2013 for example a journey from Dubai to London operated by Emirates. While some countries, such as Turkey, have similar policies to the EU, others have more limited rights. \u201cDepending on the type of ticket, they may do a lot for you and they may do nothing, just get you home,\u201d says one person who works in airline regulation. With US airlines, if there is a problem such as bad weather, you only have protections that are specified in the carrier\u2019s contract or American regulations, which are weaker than those in the EU, says Brehany. \u201cIn those circumstances consumers have found that they have had to battle with US airlines and, in some cases, have spent many months seeking compensation for delays or, indeed, cancellations; it appears, also, that it is difficult for the US regulator to secure a resolution. Often consumers are left with little choice but to seek recompense through their credit card supplier or travel insurer,\u201d he adds. \u201cThose using airlines, say, from the Middle East, may find that they face the same difficulties; however, some non-EU airlines actually incorporate EU regulations into their terms and conditions.\u201d What about package holidays? With deals for hotels and charter flights bundled together, all-inclusive holidays are the preferred choice for thousands of British families. But your rights are the same as if you book the flight alone. \u201cAll flights from the EU or into the EU on an EU airline are covered by the legislation regardless of whether it forms part of a package or not. Make a claim directly to the airline responsible, rather than the tour operator or travel agent they booked with,\u201d says Matt Buffey of the CAA. Where are my bags? As well as the chaos of having no flights to get on, many of those disrupted by the BA outage had no baggage, either. The airline spent days returning tens of thousands of items, some of which were forwarded to destinations while their owners were stuck in London. Airlines are responsible, under the Montreal convention, for bags that are checked in. The best way to report a problem is by filing a \u201cproperty irregularity report\u201d before leaving the baggage reclaim area, says Brehany. If there is a delay in filing the report, the airline may reject the late claims. \u201cYour rights are contained under the convention and it is clear that you must present receipts for any items you buy until you are reunited with your baggage,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe convention sets out the maximum level of compensation you can receive under special drawing rights for lost/delayed bags; this is currently valued at just over \u00a31,300 \u2013 remember, you may not receive the maximum and you should be prepared to be challenged about expenditure.\u201d Bags that have not turned up within 21 days are considered lost. Upgrading and downgrading No passenger will pass on being upgraded to business or first class. But being downgraded due to lack of seats can result in a reimbursement. According to the CAA, being downgraded on a short flight can result in a 30% refund; on a medium-haul flight 50% and long haul 75%. You must be reimbursed within seven days. \u201cThe rules are clear: if they move you to a higher class, they cannot request an additional payment,\u201d says Brehany. What if the airline doesn\u2019t pay? Under dispute legislation introduced last year, passengers who have been unable to resolve a complaint with an airline can get an independent decision which must be abided by. \u201cThe majority of UK airlines already offer passengers access to these services and nearly 80% of journeys from the UK are now covered by airlines who are signed up to dispute resolution services,\u201d says Buffey. \u201cWe are continuing our work to ensure airlines provide passengers with the support they are entitled to, and will not hesitate to take action if we see airlines systematically failing to comply with the regulations.\u201d",

The right to compensation depends on the reason for the cancellation and airlines can claim \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d such as security risk or severe weather.</p> <p>The consumer rights magazine Which? says it is worth challenging an airline if you don\u2019t agree with its often-used claim of \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d, for example \u201cif you\u2019re told you can\u2019t fly due to weather conditions, but other flights are departing\u201d.</p> <p>Frank Brehany, consumer director of HolidayTravelWatch \u2013 which helps people complain about holiday problems \u2013 says he recently dealt with a case where a flight from Toulouse to London had been cancelled.</p> <p>Passengers were not compensated properly as the airline claimed there had been an \u201cunexpected strike\u201d.

      "bodyText": "There is a small but vibrant web forum, housepricecrash.co.uk, whose members\u2019 outrage at inflated property prices is matched only by their dismay that the longed-for slump has never materialised. After Nationwide reported last week that house prices had fallen for the third month in a row, its faithful believe the day of reckoning is finally coming. The average home fell in value by 0.2% in May, said Nationwide, following on from declines of 0.4% in April and 0.3% in March. Not since the height of the financial crisis in 2009 have prices fallen for three months in a row. When the report of that data was published on theguardian.com, the highest-rated response below the line was: \u201cIf you have a house for sale, drop the price because in six months it\u2019s going to be a lot lower.\u201d It is worth taking a closer look at the data. The most striking figure to emerge is that house prices in May actually rose \u2013 from \u00a3207,699 to \u00a3208,711. Nationwide reported them as falling only after making a seasonal adjustment. That may make statistical sense to some, but it\u2019s no comfort to a buyer whose deposit won\u2019t be seasonally adjusted by their bank. The unadjusted figure of \u00a3208,711 is actually the all-time record high for house prices in the UK. But a slowdown in London \u2013 and outright declines in many boroughs \u2013 is evident to any buyer. The capital is both the reception city for migrants, now falling in number, and the exit city for the UK\u2019s financial services industry post-Brexit. It would be remarkable if its rental and sales markets had done anything other than go into reverse. The glut of luxury apartment building only adds to the downward pressure. The question for the 87% of the British population not in London is how far this will ripple beyond the capital. There are some good reasons why it should; the absolute level of prices is so high that further expansion is almost inconceivable. While London prices reflect an international market, in towns and cities elsewhere they must be supported by local UK incomes, which are currently static at best. Crucially, we are also seeing the end of the buy-to-let landlord as the marginal buyer of virtually every new one- or two-bed flat to come on to the market. Stamp duty, higher taxes and strict new affordability tests have sent lending to landlords into freefall. It is a long-overdue rebalancing of the market, and will inevitably depress prices. Every hit on landlords and fall in prices is greeted cheerfully by young adults, who have been priced out of the market. But there\u2019s the rub. The scale of the decline in home ownership among the young has been so dramatic that it has created a vast level of pent-up demand. It means that any significant fall in the market will provoke a \u201crelief rally\u201d of buying by those who have been desperate to get on the fabled ladder. Now throw into this mix Britain\u2019s near permanent failure to build enough houses. Then add migration \u2013 yes, it\u2019s down, but instead of the need to build a new city the size of Sheffield each year, it suggests we need to build one the size of Brighton, and there\u2019s little sign of that. What all this tells you is that price falls, when they come, are likely to be moderate rather than steep. Always bear in mind that house prices are largely a function of how much a bank is willing to lend against an asset. Banks and building societies, no longer lending in volume to landlords, are now throwing money at first-time buyers. Rates for 90% loans have tumbled to as low as 1.9% for two-year deals and just 2.55% for five-year fixes. Of course, we can\u2019t rule out a house-price crash. The fog of Brexit will becalm the market for several years to come. But a full-scale crash requires a steep rise in interest rates \u2013 and, for now, no one is forecasting that. Sorry, pension fund managers: your relief may be short-lived What do BT and British Airways have in common? You could point to the public relations disasters that dog each organisation: one hitting the headlines recently following its accounting scandal, the other struggling to cope with the after-effects of last weekend\u2019s cancelled flights. The other problem they share is a huge shortfall in their retirement fund. But there is good news on this front, because pension deficits at the UK\u2019s largest companies appear to be falling. Pension adviser Mercer said last week that the collective deficit of final salary pension schemes among FTSE 350 firms fell in the past month by more than \u00a310bn \u2013 from \u00a3145bn to \u00a3134bn. One of the biggest factors was a year of rising stock markets: they are at all- time highs in New York and London. Another, more surprising, factor is a slowdown in decades of improving life expectancy. In March, an Institute of Actuaries paper showed that the usual annual improvements in life expectancies were slowing. Mortality rates showed fairly steady improvements of 2.6% a year for men and 2.2% for women between 2000 and 2011. Since then, it says, annual increases have been close to zero. Accountant PwC says total liabilities for the UK\u2019s 5,800 final salary pension schemes, which it estimates at \u00a32tn, would fall by 15%, or \u00a3310bn. Not everyone agrees. Andrew Scott and Lynda Gratton of London Business School \u2013 authors of a recent book, The 100-Year Life \u2013 argue that the majority of children born in rich countries today can expect to live to more than 100, and individuals and employers should be planning on that basis. Other experts counter that poorer people and those most likely to suffer ill-health, and drag down mortality averages, are less likely to be in jobs with generous retirement schemes. With this in mind, far from breathing a sigh of relief following news of a short-term cut in pension deficits, employers should continue to prepare for the worst. Failing French Connection continues in splendid isolation French Connection was once a big brand \u2013 remember when every teenager wanted FCUK on their T-shirt? But the label has been drifting for a decade and has run up five years of losses. At this point, big shareholders might suggest new management is required. But founder Stephen Marks, with over 40 years at the helm of the fashion retailer, still believes he knows best. Marks has always found corporate governance a tad challenging. He is the biggest shareholder and is dug in as both chair and chief executive. The group doesn\u2019t even have the requisite two independent non-executive directors to challenge him. Activist investor Gatemore Capital says no one has a \u201cGod-given right\u201d to run a company and he should step down or run a transparent sale process. It is probably right. But history suggests Marks won\u2019t care. The shares are around 37p, compared with 487p in their heyday: but, like the retailer\u2019s fashions, they still look expensive.",

But founder Stephen Marks, with over 40 years at the helm of the fashion retailer, still believes he knows best.</p> <p>Marks has always found corporate governance a tad challenging. He is the biggest shareholder and is dug in as both chair and chief executive. The group doesn\u2019t even have the requisite two independent non-executive directors to challenge him. Activist investor Gatemore Capital says no one has a \u201cGod-given right\u201d to run a company and he should step down or run a transparent sale process.</p> <p>It is probably right. But history suggests Marks won\u2019t care. The shares are around 37p, compared with 487p in their heyday: but, like the retailer\u2019s fashions, they still look expensive.</p>",

      "bodyText": "An important moment during the so-called election \u201cdebates\u201d last week occurred when a young lady in the studio audience told Theresa May that she had voted for Brexit because she had swallowed the lie that it would bring \u00a3350m a week for the health service. The prime minister, an uncomfortable Remainer and now an uncomfortable Brexiter, had no answer to this, resorting to the cliche that the government spends more every year on the NHS. This, like so many of the answers trotted out by her (also uncomfortable) team is an example of what Dr Johnson might have called \u201ca last refuge of the political scoundrel\u201d. The crisis arises because the increase in NHS spending each year is nowhere near enough to meet the well-known demands on the service. As I understand it, extra NHS spending is running at no more than 1% a year in \u201creal\u201d \u2013 ie inflation-adjusted \u2013 terms, whereas merely to avoid going backwards the service needs an annual real-terms increase of 4%. Furthermore, the situation threatens to get a whole lot worse, as the service suffers from the thinly disguised racism behind Ukip\u2019s conquest of the Conservative party \u2013 and May\u2019s obsession with reducing immigration almost guarantees an impending recruitment crisis. Of course, the problems in the NHS are only the most publicised of the obstacles facing the public sector generally. There are also looming crises in the pensions business, as well as goodness knows how many problems facing this country\u2019s schools and its transport infrastructure. It all boils down to two essential factors: one, referred to in this column a few weeks ago, is the fantasy that we can enjoy Scandinavian levels of public service and welfare on US-style tax rates. (It is, by the way, scandalous that the right wing of the Conservative party and their ghastly tabloids have made \u201cwelfare\u201d into a dirty word \u2013 while always promising tax cuts.) The major political parties are beginning to recognise this, up to a point. The second factor is a decline to barely recognisable levels in the annual increase in economic productivity. As the economist Simon Wren-Lewis has pointed out, this goes back, like so many other economic and social problems, to the 2007-09 financial crisis. We thought we had learned a lot from the economic disasters of the interwar years, and for decades after 1945 policies conducive to growth were taken for granted. This was all lost after the financial crisis \u2013 a crisis that itself illustrated how the lessons of the 1920s had been forgotten, most of which are readily available in JK Galbraith\u2019s book The Great Crash 1929. George Osborne\u2019s misconceived austerity programme hardly constituted the kind of policy for growth that would encourage business to invest in the pursuit of gains to productivity. Nor did his cuts to public sector investment. As Wren-Lewis reminds us, recoveries from past recessions have been characterised by periods of rapid growth. No such luck in this decade, and, having analysed the Conservative manifesto, the Institute for Fiscal Studies emphasises that what is in store if they get back with untrammelled authority is at least five more years of austerity. This puts May\u2019s claims about her \u201cgreat national mission\u201d in perspective. Brexit, we are told, gives us \u201can enormous opportunity\u201d. Why, thanks to her lame acceptance of a narrow result in an advisory, non-binding and grossly ill-informed referendum, \u201cwe have the opportunity to change the country for the better\u201d. Well, who wants to change the country for the worse? Sounds like a rhetorical question, doesn\u2019t it? But it isn\u2019t. The people who in effect want to change the country for the worse, whether or not they realise it, are those leaders and would-be leaders \u2013 I fear this appears to include the Labour party too \u2013 who are embracing Brexit. It was Boris Johnson who predicted, with his usual misuse of our language, that Brexit would be \u201ca Titanic success\u201d \u2013 a most unfortunate metaphor. Now, some of my fellow Remainers are hoping that when it becomes clear in due course that Brexit would almost certainly be a Titanic disaster, even our present generation of leaders may recognise the need to reconsider the entire project. The terrible truth is, however, that much damage will have been done meanwhile. Indeed, one reads and hears almost daily of decisions that are already being taken by firms dependent on the single market to relocate at least part of their operations, and of academic institutions and research organisations experiencing serious recruitment problems, especially of the skilled immigrants who counterbalance this country\u2019s skills deficiencies. It has not been unamusing to witness the narrowing of the opinion polls and signs of panic in the May ranks. For anyone who cares about prospective damage from Brexit, an ideal result on Thursday would be a hung parliament in which neither main party could form a government without embarking on a coalition with the Lib Dems and SNP \u2013 a condition of whose cooperation would be to think again on Brexit. Brexit is the biggest disaster facing this country since the second world war. That war brought Winston Churchill to the fore as a leader who opposed the appeasers. Where is the leader who can stand up to the Brexiters? Alas, not May.",
