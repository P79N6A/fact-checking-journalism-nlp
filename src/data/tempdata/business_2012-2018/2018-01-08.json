      "bodyText": "In the week before Christmas the government yet again released its latest data on greenhouse gas emissions in the hope they would be missed amid other news and the nearing festivities. As we start the new year let us revisit the data and highlight just how terrible the government\u2019s record on emission reduction has been. The news that the temperature in Penrith reached 47.3C on Sunday naturally had people talking of climate change. And while noting that a very hot day is evidence of climate change is not as stupid as the very stable genius, Donald Trump, suggesting that the cold snap in the east of the USA meant climate change was fake, we should remember that weather \u2013 even if it is hot \u2013 is still not climate. Fortunately we do have data that shows the average temperatures for the entire planet over a year, and not just for a day, in a particular part of Australia. Less fortunate however, the data shows that things are very bad. 2017 will be the second warmest year on record and easily the warmest ever for a year not affected by El Nino: It means that 2017 will be first time in six years that the calendar year has not been warmer than the one which preceded it. But that is small comfort, given it is warmer than every single year that did precede it but one. All this fits appropriately with the news of Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. I should of course note that the news is a bit old \u2013 although you might have missed it. In 2016, the government released its emissions data on the Thursday before Christmas Day. Last year they were a bit better \u2013 they did it on the Tuesday before Christmas. Rather coincidentally it was also the day Malcolm Turnbull announced the reshuffle of his ministry and the government released its energy policy review. I know the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, would be disappointed if you had missed the release amid all that news, so let me give you a recap: short version \u2013 they are terrible; long version \u2013 they are terrible, and there is little hope that they will get better. In the 12 months to September 2016, Australia\u2019s annual greenhouse gas emissions rose to a record level of 550.2 Mt CO2-e if you include the rather dodgy emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sectors. The government\u2019s report sought to paint a nice picture, noting that this was just 0.7% above the previous year and was \u201c0.8% below emissions in 2000 and 9.1% below emissions in 2005\u201d. But we can all cherry pick dates. For example, while it might be below 2000 and 2005 levels the latest emissions are around 4% above where they were in June 2014. The government likes to include LULUCF emissions when comparing with 2000 and 2005, because back then we had a lot of such emissions, due to tree clearing and the like: If we include such emissions in our overall count it means we can reduce our emissions by simply planting trees, or not clearing land (or promising to do so). That is why both in the Kyoto protocol and in the 2005 Paris agreement, Australian governments have made sure such emissions are counted. Unfortunately this has been a long practice. The release of the latest cabinet papers from the final years of the Keating government showed the then ALP government sought a \u201cno regrets\u201d policy on climate change which essentially meant doing nothing that would increase electricity prices and trying to achieve reductions through limiting land clearing and planting trees. The exclusion of LULUCF emissions shows just how greatly this affects our goal of reducing emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2030: Including LULULCF has us currently 9.1% below 2005 levels, but if you exclude them, Australia\u2019s emissions are nearly 6% higher than they were in 2005. The reality is \u201cno regrets\u201d and other climate change cons such as a \u201cgreen army\u201d or direct action do not work. And the latest emissions data shows this clearly. Since the removal of the carbon price in June 2014, annual emissions have grown every quarter: And you don\u2019t need to be a Rhodes scholar presiding over a party room full of climate change deniers to know why. Putting a price on carbon provided an incentive for firms to use less of it. Removing that price removed the incentive. It\u2019s fortunate for the government that there is some good news \u2013 though this good news occurred in spite of its policies rather than due to them. Annual electricity emissions have fallen \u2013 down 3.7% in the last year. But mostly this is due to a fall in demand for electricity and the reduction in the use of brown coal generated electricity due to the closure of the Hazelwood power station: The problem for the government is that while the inclusion of LULUCF emissions and slowing electricity demand do help their path towards a 26% cut on 2005 levels by 2030, they remain a very long way from achieving that aim. The government also released its latest emissions projection figures. And while the projections are lower than they were a year ago, they still predict Australia\u2019s emissions by 2030 will be just 5% below 2005 levels: The government\u2019s energy policy \u2013 even if it allows a quasi price on carbon through buying of international permits \u2013 will not do anywhere near enough to reach the goal (no matter how much it annoys Tony Abbott). The problem is that even if electricity emissions were to fall by 26% below 2005 levels, Australia\u2019s overall emissions would still be just 9% below 2005 levels (and 4% above if you exclude LULUCF emissions). The time has come for our politicians to quit pretending we can reduce emissions painlessly. If that was actually possible it would have already been done by every government on the planet. Climate change isn\u2019t a problem because the solution is easy. Time is running out. Yes, Australia only has a small percentage of the global land mass and emissions but either we are part of the global solution or we stand complicit with the ignorant and the charlatans who would say it is all a hoax. The aim is to stop temperatures from rising to more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. We are already around 1.1C above those levels. Even using a very conservative liner trend of the past 50 years (something that is close to a best case scenario) we will reach 2C by 2071 \u2013 just 53 years time. If that sounds a long time away, note that according the latest life expectancy figures all Australia males under 28 and all females under 32 can expect to live till then. That means 41% of Australians will likely live to experience such temperatures, unless action is taken. But while we have a government with climate change deniers in key cabinet positions and which hides emissions data under the cover of Christmas holidays and a news dump I have little faith Australia will be part of any such action.",

      "bodyText": "Vauxhall says it is cutting jobs at Ellesmere Port so it can move to a single daily production shift. This will \u201caccelerate the recovery of plant productivity\u201d, it argues. Unions, though, say the cuts show the importance of a transition deal that shields the industry from Brexit disruption. Here\u2019s the full story: And that\u2019s all for tonight, GW Here\u2019s Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Business Secretary, on the loss of a further 250 jobs at Vauxhall\u2019s Ellesmere Port plant: \u2018\u2019When PSA Group took over Vauxhall last year the Government promised it would do the utmost to protect workers, but since then a third of jobs at Ellesmere Port have been cut. \u201cThe Tories are failing to give businesses and workers the security they need to navigate Brexit, which has been demonstrated again in today\u2019s EEF report on manufacturer\u2019s expectations for 2018. \u201cThe Government must set out how it will support the plant and urgently provide certainty for the sector as a whole after Brexit.\u2019\u2019 Hello again. London\u2019t stock market couldn\u2019t close at a fresh record high tonight. The blue-chip index ended the day down 27 points at 7696, a drop of around 0.3%. Europe had a better day, though, with the German DAX and Italian FTSE MIB both up 0.38% and the French CAC close behind. Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at City Index, says: The FTSE quickly hit a fresh record high in early trade as the \u201cJanuary Effect\u201d boosted equities. However, the index was unable to maintain the pace and soon drifted into the red, where it spent most of the day. It was a fairly muted start to the trading week; however, volatility is due to pick up given the slew of corporate releases on the calendar going forward. Micro Focus was the standout loser on the FTSE, shedding over 16% after the software maker disappointed investors with the interim update. The shares hit a low of 2116, its lowest level since August last year. Britain\u2019s car industry has just been dealt two pieces of bad news. Firstly, auto group PSA is cutting an extra 250 jobs at its Vauxhall factory at Ellesmere Port, in the North West of England. This takes the total headcount cuts to 750. In a statement, Vauxhall says: \u201cAt a meeting held on Thursday 4 January 2018 between representatives from Vauxhall Motors and UNITE the Union, the company explained that although the initial voluntary separation programme at its Ellesmere Port plant announced in October (aligned to adjustment of production volumes in order to protect its future) has been successful, it needs to initiate a further voluntary programme for eligible employees of a further 250 heads in the period from April to the end of September 2018.\u201d The Ellesmere Port, which produces the Vauxhall Astra, has been hit by falling demand. PSA has also warned that Brexit uncertainty will also affect investment decisions. PSA, which also owns Peugeot, says it remains committed to the Ellesmere Port site - but dropped a heavy hint that future improvements are needed. \u201cVauxhall Management affirmed the company\u2019s continued commitment to the Astra plant at Ellesmere Port. \u201cThe company remains confident in the ability of the Ellesmere Port workforce to deliver the necessary improvements in financial performance.\u201d Secondly, rival carmaker Jaguar Landrover has warned that the UK economy is tough. JLR says it achieved record worldwide sales last year, up 7% to 621,109 vehicles, thanks to strong demand in China and the US. Britain, though, is more problematic. Group sales operations director Andy Goss says: \u201cWe have once again delivered year-on-year sales increases thanks to a world-class product range and new models such as the E-PACE and Velar, as well as China-specific models such as the XFL. \u201cBut we are facing tough times in key markets such as the UK where consumer confidence and diesel taxes will hit us.\u201d Last week, the car industry reported that sales fell by 5.7% last year, with further declines expected in 2018..... Take note, bullish investors. Bloomberg\u2019s Luke Kawa has calculated that several major stock market indices have now surged to levels that suggest they are \u2018overbought\u2019. That\u2019s often (but not always) a prelude to a correction. Kawa explains: The S&amp;P 500 Index, MSCI Asia Pacific Index, MSCI World Index, Nikkei 225 Index, and MSCI Emerging Markets Index are all in overbought territory, while the Euro Stoxx 600 Index lingers just shy of such a level. The average reading for this collection of gauges soared to a weekly record as of Jan. 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1988. The relative strength index is a technical indicator that tracks the magnitude and speed of price fluctuations. Typically, a security with an RSI above 70 is considered to be overbought, while those below 30 are viewed as oversold. The New York stock market has opened without major drama. In early trading, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 indices have both dipped by 0.1%. In other news... the former executive chairman of auto repair and insurance group AA is bringing legal action over his sacking last year, following a bust-up with a colleague. Bob Mackenzie lost his job - and share options worth millions of pounds - after reportedly starting a \u2018physical altercation\u2019 in a hotel bar, which triggered his dismissal. The Press Association has the story: AA has said it is \u201castonished\u201d over news that ousted chairman Bob Mackenzie is pushing for an employment tribunal hearing after being fired over gross misconduct last summer. The breakdown recovery and car insurance firm may now be forced to defend its decision to sack Mr Mackenzie - a move that was formally announced in August. AA said in a statement: \u201cWe are astonished that Mr Mackenzie is taking this to an employment tribunal. \u201cWe stand by our decision to dismiss him for gross misconduct following his sustained and violent assault on another employee of the AA, and will robustly defend any action.\u201d Reports have linked his dismissal to an attempted spin-off of the AA\u2019s insurance arm, which led to a physical altercation between Mr Mackenzie and insurance chief Michael Lloyd, as well as an earlier altercation in a public place with someone not thought to be an employee of the company. AA has since called on Mr Mackenzie to pay back more than \u00a31.2m, accounting for annual bonuses stretching from 2016 to 2017. No change at the top of Britain\u2019s finance ministry: It\u2019s been another lively day in the world of crypto-currencies. Bitcoin has tumbled by over 9%, taking its value back down to $14,650. Three weeks ago hit an all-time peak of nearly $20,000 before retracing its steps. But other digital currencies are in vogue, including Ether (the coin behind the Ethereum distributed app platform). The crypto boom has also pushed dogecoin to a fresh record high - even though this particular digital coin was created as a spoof. The FT\u2019s Alice Woodhouse explains: Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency based on an internet meme of a Shiba Inu dog, almost doubled in value over the weekend, bringing its market capitalisation to more than $2bn on Sunday. Launched as a joke digital currency in late 2013 by self-described \u201cdata geek\u201d Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin describes itself as the \u201cfun and friendly internet currency\u201d. The digital currency\u2019s recent gains suggest it has been caught up in the recent investor frenzy for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Credit rating agency Fitch has added to the optimistic mood in the markets, by reporting that the outlook for credit is the best in a decade. Fitch reports that the number of likely credit upgrades in 2018 and 2019 outnumbers potential downgrades by the most since 2008. But it also warns that this may be as good as it gets - some companies could find it harder to service their debts once interest rates rise higher. Monica Insoll, a Fitch managing director, explains: \u201cThe rating outlook trend is the most upbeat in a decade, with positive outlooks outnumbering negatives. But the net bias is only just over 1% and occurs as the world is about to hit peak growth in the current cycle. The continued tightening of monetary policy, together with significant policy and political uncertainty, is likely to pose increasing challenges to ratings.\u201d The futures market suggests the US stock market will hold onto Friday night\u2019s record highs, when trading begins in an hour. Over in Germany, acting chancellor Angela Merkel has entered coalition talks with the left-leaning Social Democrats. It looks like a final attempt to form a new government, following last autumn\u2019s inconclusive election. Reaching an agreement could be tough; the SPD are likely to demand concessions on issues like welfare spending, tax, and European integration. But optimism that a deal is possible is helping the market today, says Mike van Dulken, head of Research at Accendo Markets: \u201cEquities are off their best levels but maintain a northerly bearing, buoyed by German coalition talks and fresh highs on Wall St, despite mixed Eurozone macro data and commodities off their best levels. A stronger US dollar helps, pushing the British pound and the euro lower, especially the latter to ensure the German DAX outperforms the UK FTSE. US futures point to another positive opening this afternoon. Over in Athens, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has told his first cabinet meeting of the year that Greece is in the \u201cfinal stretch\u201d of its third bailout programme. Helena Smith reports from Athens The leftist leader told cabinet members that he expected the debt-stricken country, under international surveillance since 2010, to return to international markets after its current economic adjustment program officially expires in August. Sounding an optimistic note, Tsipras described 2018 as a landmark year that would be replete with challenge, adding: \u201c2018 is a milestone year ... a year full of challenges that in order to be met require hard work so that this can also be a year of vindication for the sacrifices of the Greek people.\u201d The third - and penultimate - compliance review of terms agreed in exchange for emergency funding under Greece\u2019s latest bailout was reaching conclusion, the prime minister told his cabinet. When Athens enters \u201cthe last chapter\u201d of fiscal adjustment Greece will have closed a \u201chuge circle of supervision which began in May 2010 when the country was excluded from money markets,\u201d he said. A multi-bill outlining almost 100 agreed reforms known as \u201cprior actions\u201d will be submitted to parliament tomorrow ahead of a three-day debate. Leading members of Tsipras\u2019 leftist Syriza party have voiced opposition to some of the more onerous measures, such as electronic auctions of property owners who are indebted to banks. Sterling has made a subdued start to the week, as traders watch Theresa May reshuffle her cabinet. The pound dropped 0.2% to $1.354 against the US dollar, but has risen a little against the euro to \u20ac1.13. The cabinet reshuffle could have implications for Brexit; according to the Daily Telegraph, the PM will appoint \u201ca cabinet minister for no-deal\u201d, who will prepare for a Hard Brexit. Royal Bank of Canada say: The UK papers are full with reports of a pending cabinet reshuffle of May\u2019s government. The most interesting development for markets seems the planned creation of a \u2018minister for no-deal Brexit\u2019 which should underpin the notion of the UK being in a position to walk away from the negotiations with the EU. The reshuffle is getting up to speed now, with Northern Ireland secretary James Brokenshire resigning on health grounds, and confusion over whether transport secretary Chris Grayling has been moved to become Conservative Party chairman. My colleague Andrew Sparrow has full details in his Politics Live blog: World stock markets are celebrating their best start to a new year since 2010 this morning. European shares are doing their bit, having hit their highest level since August 2015 this morning, after Asia rallied to near-record levels. Traders are encouraged by this morning\u2019s strong consumer confidence and investor sentiment survey, which suggests the eurozone economy is continuing to flourish. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, sees no sign of \u2018January Blues\u2019 in the markets today: \u201cAll the key indicators for December show that confidence amongst investors and consumers is firmly on the rise, which only increases the likelihood of the European Central Bank winding down its quantitative easing programme. \u201cAfter being in the doldrums for so long, the eurozone has rebounded in spectacular fashion, with investors piling into the euro in their droves. In another piece of encouraging soft data, the European Commission\u2019s economic confidence index has hit its highest level since 2000. The sentiment index has risen to 116, beating forecasts of 114.8, showing that the pick-up in Europe\u2019s economy has raised morale in the region. Just in: Investor optimism across the eurozone has risen, in the latest sign of confidence in the global economy. The monthly survey of investor morale produced by research group Sentix jumped to 32.9, up from December\u2019s 31.1. When asked about the current economic situation, investors were at their most upbeat since 2007. This optimism underlines why stock markets have been rallying recently, as investors react to signs that economic growth is picking. Sentix says: \u201cThe economy in all regions of the world is looking stable and positive and is showing moderate improvements.... \u201cThe upturn is therefore broad and synchronous. The likelihood of possible overheating is rising.\u201d Jonathan Samuels, CEO of property lender Octane Capital, agrees that UK house prices will be subdued this year. Halifax\u2019s verdict on 2017 is of a flat and uneventful year, restrained by economic uncertainty in the light of Brexit and consumer caution given the high cost of living.\u201d Few would argue with theHalifax\u2019s conclusion that UK price growth is likely to remain pedestrian at best during 2018. \u201cLow single digit growth is about as exciting as it\u2019s going to get, but in reality this is a positive for the market given the affordability crisis in many areas of the country. Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, says UK house-buyers are driving harder bargains - so owners need to be \u2018realistic\u2019 when setting prices. There is no doubt that prices are softening, particularly in London, but Halifax also confirms what we are seeing on the high street - that a lot of hard bargaining is going on and people are generally trying to get on with their moves. \u2018We don\u2019t expect to see any great change in the next few months but the realistic players will succeed, whereas those wedded to the idea of the housing market we have seen in previous years will simply not sell.\u2019 Halifax also reports that house price buyers, and sellers, are in short supply: New buyer enquiries appeared a little more stable over the month having declined sharply in autumn, this measure, however, has now fallen for the last eight months. Turning to supply, new instructions to sell continued to deteriorate at the headline level and has now fallen for 22 consecutive months \u2013 the worst sequence for close to eight years. UK house prices fell by 0.6% in December, according to the latest survey from Halifax bank. It\u2019s the first monthly decline since last June, and the latest signal that Britain\u2019s property market is weakening. Halifax also reports that prices only rose by 2.7% during 2017, with the quarterly growth rate slowing to 1.3% in October-December. Russell Galley, Managing Director, Halifax Community Bank, blames economic uncertainty and falling real wages. \u201cAs we\u2019d anticipated, the housing market in 2017 followed a similar pattern to the previous year. House price growth slowed, whilst building activity, completed sales and mortgage approvals for house purchase all remained flat. This has been driven by a squeeze on real wage growth and continuing uncertainty over the economy. However, nationally house prices in 2018 are likely to be supported by the ongoing shortage of properties for sale, low levels of housebuilding, high employment and a continuation of low interest rates making mortgage servicing affordable in relative terms. Overall we expect annual price growth to continue in the range of 0-3% at the end 2018.\u201d Here\u2019s some rapid reaction from property analyst Pete Wargent... ..and economist Shaun Richards Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has hit a fresh record high today. The blue-chip gauge of the biggest companies listed in London rose to 7733 points, nine points higher than Friday\u2019s record close. But the rally didn\u2019t last long. The Footsie then slipped back, thanks to tech firm Micro Focus which has slumped by 9% after releasing its latest financial results Micro Focus, which merged with Hewlett Packard\u2019s enterprise software arm last year, reported a 9.5% drop in earnings per share, despite am 80% jump in revenues thanks to the HP deal. Ouch! Shares in Mothercare have tumbled by a quarter after this morning\u2019s profit warning. Shares slumped to just 42p at the open before stabilising around 47p, down from 62p on Friday. It looks like a record low. Mothercare has shed around 90% of its value since the start of the decade, and is now worth just \u00a380m. Neil Wilson fo ETX Capital says the company has suffered from its decision not to cut prices in the run-up to Christmas. We should look to management\u2019s decision not to discount in the peak trading season as a significant contributing factor. Admirable perhaps but with competitors slashing prices ahead of Christmas amid (justified) fears of a slowdown in consumer spending, it looks as if the \u2018conscious decision\u2019 to remain at full price prior to Christmas but to then discount more heavily in the end of season sale was a mistake. Clearly Mothercare et al are up against it and the update does not bode especially well for the retail sector ahead of an important week of releases. UK mother and baby retailer Mothercare has just become the second high street retailer to hit the City with a profits warning, after a disappointing Christmas. And it looks like a stonker: Mothercare\u2019s UK like-for-like sales shrank by 7.2% in the last 12 weeks over 2017. It even managed to shrink its online sales, by 6.9%. Profits are now expected to shrink to between \u00a31m and \u00a35m this financial year; investors had expected more like \u00a310m. Mothercare blames: ...lower footfall and spend, both in stores and online, following the continuation of consumer trends flagged in our half year results. And worryingly, Mothercare\u2019s CEO Mark Newton-Jones doesn\u2019t expect any improvement in the short-term market conditions for the UK. This follows the profits warning from high-street chain Debenhams last week. Boom! European stocks have opened at their highest level in two and a half years. The Stoxx 600, which tracks the biggest companies in the region, has gained 0.3% in early trading, reaching levels last seen in August 2015. Here\u2019s Reuters take on the stock market rally: Asian shares crept toward all-time peaks on Monday after Wall Street boasted its best start to a year in over a decade, with brisk economic growth and benign inflation proving a potent cocktail for risk appetites. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.2 percent having climbed 3.1 percent last week, its strongest performance in six months. At 588.55, the index is within spitting distance of its record top of 591.50 hit in November 2007. The Philippines is already at a record, while Australian stocks eked out another decade top. Japan\u2019s Nikkei was closed for a holiday but last week touched its highest since 1992. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets remain buoyant this morning, as the bull market shows no signs of running out of steam. Investors remain optimistic about the prospects for growth and corporate earnings this year, putting aside concerns such as Brexit and the Trump presidency. China\u2019s stock market has risen to its highest levels since the second half of November, amid an optimistic session in Asia. Europe is expected to follow suit today too, with Germany\u2019s DAX also tipped to rally. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, says: Shares in Europe look set for a strong open on Monday. The FTSE 100 could buck the trend by opening lower after a record-breaking first week of trading in 2018. Optimism stemming from strength of European and global economy should help the German DAX index open at 7-week highs. The opening strength tracks small gain in Asia, where markets were unperturbed by reports from China that the PBOC think \u201cthere is room for an increase in interest rates in the short term\u201d. Last Friday\u2019s underwhelming US jobs report hasn\u2019t punctured the rally. So traders - some of whom have driven the euro up in recent weeks - will be looking at new eurozone investor confidence and retail sales figures today. In the UK, the Halifax bank will report new house price figures - at a time when prices seem to be slowing. The agenda: 8.30am GMT: Halifax UK house price index for December 9.30am GMT: The Sentix survey of investor confidence in the eurozone 10am GMT: Eurozone retail sales figures for November",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe do not want to be a company that goes on sale every two weeks as this does not build long-term trust from customers,\u201d says Mark Newton-Jones, chief executive of Mothercare, scoring top marks for retailing righteousness. The trouble is, progress towards the high ground, assuming it still exists in the world of kids\u2019 car seats and prams, can come at a heavy short-term cost. Sometimes shoppers just want cheaper stuff and throw tantrums until they get it. That, roughly speaking, was Mothercare\u2019s experience in the Christmas period. Like-for-like sales fell by a painful 7% in the UK in the Christmas period, even though the margin-destroying clearance sale was said to be lively. The minus 7% figure wasn\u2019t even distorted by a switch in trade from stores to the website. Sales via the two channels declined in tandem. The result is that full-year profits will arrive at a mere \u00a31m-\u00a35m, down from \u00a319.7m. Newton-Jones pleaded that he\u2019d flagged the fact of fewer shoppers and lower spending in his November report. Yes, but the second half of the same statement had been mildly upbeat: \u201cNotwithstanding this uncertain consumer backdrop, the Mothercare brand, whilst not immune, is in a stronger position with a much-improved product and service offer and a more robust business model.\u201d Well, yes, the refurbished stores have received good reviews and it\u2019s obviously sensible to close outlets that can\u2019t be returned to profit. But \u201crobust\u201d is not a word shareholders would attach to today\u2019s Mothercare, however much the company talks about its \u201ctransformation\u201d strategy. The market capitalisation, after Monday\u2019s 27.5% fall in the share price to a record low, has been transformed to a mere \u00a377m and year-end debt will be \u00a350m, versus net cash of \u00a313.5m two years ago. Meanwhile, the deficit in the pension fund was \u00a380m at the last count. Despite the relative health of the overseas franchise operation versus the UK stores, it\u2019s not a pretty picture. In a kinder retailing world, Mothercare\u2019s determination to avoid discounting would find its reward eventually. The Amazon machine, unfortunately, is relentless and unemotional. Mothercare last paid its shareholders a dividend in 2012, a horrible run that (almost certainly) won\u2019t improve in 2018. New focus on Micro Focus Micro Focus is the biggest tech company in the FTSE 100 these days. It occupies the unglamorous end of the market where the money is made by updating legacy infrastructure for customers that don\u2019t need the latest kit but do want software that works reliably. It is a fix-it merchant, rather than a pioneer, and the better for it. The corporate ambition is to produce long-term returns of 15%-20% a year for shareholders, from dividends and a rising share price, and it has delivered. You would have got 27.5% a year on average from owning Micro Focus shares from 2005. Now comes the first serous test of that record. It is really a test of executive chairman Kevin Loosemore\u2019s ambition in paying $9bn last year to buy Hewlett Packard\u2019s software business, which included parts of the old UK company Autonomy. The deal was massively bigger than any Micro Focus had previously attempted \u2013 indeed, it doubled the UK\u2019s company size \u2013 but investors were untroubled. From \u00a320 on the day the deal was announced in September 2016, the shares surged, hitting \u00a327 two months ago. Now they\u2019re back at \u00a321.40, down 17% on Monday, as it becomes clear that execution is far from perfect. Quite how tricky is hard to judge from outside \u2013 but \u201cbumpy\u201d, as finance director Mike Phillips put it, is not a word investors like to hear after a big deal. It suggests customers have been lost through introspection. Corporate confidence for the long term remains intact. Micro Focus expects to work its usual magic on profit margins and improve returns from the newly arrived business from 25%-ish to its own 45% or so. Terrific if it happens and, to be fair, the actual numbers in the half-year update weren\u2019t far off the City\u2019s forecasts. But you have to wonder about the wisdom of switching the highly regarded Phillips from the finance job to become director of mergers and acquisitions. Digest the mega-meal before looking for more companies to buy. Stalling house prices is good news The growth in house prices in 2017 was 2.7%, says the Halifax, and expect more of the same this year \u2013 0%-3%. That forecast sounds reasonable since the Halifax\u2019s numbers show that affordability remains strained by historical standards. Average house prices are about six times average household earnings, a ratio that has held for a couple of years now and seems to be as much as the UK market can bear. The only real counter-veiling force is the shortage of homes on the market. That factor, as with earnings, is unlikely to change meaningfully this year. It\u2019s sideways for house prices all the way to Brexit \u2013 bad news for estate agents but, actually, probably healthy for the economy. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The former AA chairman, who was sacked after a \u201csustained and violent assault\u201d on a colleague at a five-star hotel, is taking the company to an employment tribunal. The roadside repair firm declared itself \u201castonished\u201d at the legal claim by Bob Mackenzie, who was dismissed for gross misconduct last year following the late-night incident. Mackenzie is also understood to be considering whether to launch a separate legal claim for his share of a bonus scheme potentially worth tens of millions. His departure followed a late-night incident in the bar of the Pennyhill Park hotel in Surrey, captured on CCTV, in which he attacked the company\u2019s insurance boss, Mike Lloyd. Mackenzie\u2019s lawyers are understood to be claiming that he was wrongfully dismissed, having been under extreme pressure and should be entitled to damages. They will also say that the company had excluded him from talks over a proposed merger between the AA\u2019s insurance business and rival Hastings, which they say was a factor in the altercation. Friends and family members have said that the company had placed extreme pressure on Mackenzie, who was \u201cnot well\u201d and had mixed the prescription drug diazepam with alcohol before the attack. In a statement, the AA said: \u201cWe are astonished that Mr Mackenzie is taking this to an employment tribunal. We stand by our decision to dismiss him for gross misconduct following his sustained and violent assault on another employee of the AA, and will robustly defend any action.\u201d A spokesperson for Mackenzie declined to comment. Mackenzie\u2019s dismissal meant he was designated a \u201cbad leaver\u201d and forfeited his part in a share bonus scheme rewarding directors involved in the AA\u2019s 2014 float that sources said could have been worth more than \u00a370m. He had been executive chairman of the AA since 2014, when he was instrumental in the stock market flotation. The AA\u2019s announcement of his sacking sent the company\u2019s shares tumbling 14%, wiping about \u00a3200m off the value of the company. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Car manufacturer Vauxhall is to cut another 250 jobs at its plant in Ellesmere Port, bringing the total number of redundancies announced over the past three months to 650. The manufacturer, which was taken over by the French PSA Group last year, said the job losses at the Wirral plant were due to the factory moving to one daily production shift and would \u201caccelerate the recovery of plant productivity\u201d. In October, Vauxhall said it was cutting 400 jobs at the site, which makes the Astra car. The 650 job cuts, which Vauxhall said it would seek through voluntary redundancies, will mean more than a third of the workforce will have been lost since PSA took control \u2013 despite pledges to retain jobs. Vauxhall said it remained committed to the plant, which has question marks over its future in the wake of the the EU referendum vote. Sales of the Astra have declined, and the motor industry\u2019s trade body warned last week that on top of dwindling UK registrations of new cars, manufacturers were holding off from investing in production because of uncertainty over the shape of Brexit. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite trade union, which represents Ellesmere Port workers, urged the government to provide guarantees on post-Brexit trade to UK-based car manufacturers. \u201cWe ask that ministers give PSA and other manufacturers a clear signal that government will do all it needs to support this crucial sector through the Brexit process,\u201d he said. In a statement, Vauxhall said it had met union representatives last week to explain that the first 400 job cuts were not enough. It said: \u201cAlthough the initial voluntary separation programme at its Ellesmere Port plant announced in October has been successful, it needs to initiate a further voluntary programme for eligible employees of a further 250 heads.\u201d PSA, which makes Peugeot and Citroen, has said in the past that costs at the plant were higher than others in its group. It finalised a deal last August to buy Vauxhall from General Motors. Vauxhall also has a UK plant in Luton, where the Vivaro van is made. Meanwhile, Britain\u2019s biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, said its global sales rose last year by 7% to a record 621,109 vehicles \u2013 but warned that weakening consumer confidence and increased taxes on new diesel vehicles could hit business. JLR said that growth in China, its largest market, and in the US had helped to offset difficult conditions in Britain and the rest of Europe. Its sales operations director, Andy Goss, said: \u201cWe are facing tough times in key markets such as the UK where consumer confidence and diesel taxes will hit us.\u201d The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said on Friday that UK sales could drop even faster in 2018 than in 2017, when sales fell by 5.4%, their biggest drop since 2009. The SMMT said the \u201cdemonisation of diesel\u201d was partly to blame, as well as economic uncertainty. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Dominic Chappell, who owned retailer BHS when it collapsed into administration with the loss of thousands of jobs, failed to provide information about its ailing pension schemes to investigators, a court has heard. Chappell is being prosecuted by The Pensions Regulator (TPR) in the latest fallout from the demise of BHS, which he bought for \u00a31 from retail tycoon Sir Philip Green in 2015. Lawyers for the regulator said Chappell did not respond to three requests for information about BHS\u2019s two pension schemes, which had 19,000 members and a combined \u00a3571m deficit when the company went into administration in April 2016. Green has agreed to pay \u00a3363m towards the deficit since the chain\u2019s collapse but the regulator is still pursuing Chappell for a sum thought to be around \u00a317m. The regulator claims Chappell breached the Pensions Act by failing on three occasions to hand over information. Chappell, who denies the allegations, previously told the court he did not see at least one of the regulator\u2019s demands for information because he was \u201con a boat\u201d. Alex Stein, prosecuting for the regulator, told Brighton magistrates\u2019 court: \u201cOn March 11, 2015, BHS, the retail chain, was sold to [Chappell\u2019s buyout vehicle] Retail Acquisitions Ltd. \u201cAt the time, it had some 11,000 employees and the regulator had some concerns over the two pension schemes that it had in place. \u201cThe regulator then launched an investigation into the sale.\u201d Stein said the regulator subsequently made two initial requests for information, in April and May 2016. \u201cDespite numerous reminders and assurances from the defendant and his advisers, nothing has been received in relation to the two notices,\u201d said Stein. The third notice refers to the regulator\u2019s request for information from Chappell about an alleged leak of information from a confidential \u201cwarning notice\u201d sent in November 2016. Chappell\u2019s lawyer, Michael Levy, told the hearing that the notice had been sent out \u201cin security that would have made 007 proud\u201d. Levy said Chappell had taken a call while he was driving from someone who claimed to be from the Daily Telegraph newspaper and quoted passages from the warning notice. \u201cHe [Chappell] tells his instructed solicitor. He phones the office of TPR that day and speaks to someone he doesn\u2019t know. \u201cHe reports that. Later on, some weeks later, he reports that in a letter to TPR. He has reported it.\u201d Stein, for TPR, said there was no record of the phone call. \u201cThat account has never been given to the regulator before,\u201d he said. Chappell, 51, denies three charges of neglecting or refusing to provide information and documents, without a reasonable excuse, contrary to the Pensions Act 2004. Last year, he told the court he had not seen the summons from the pensions regulator or any of the formal documentation. When asked why by district judge William Ashworth, Chappell replied: \u201cBecause I was away, I did not have internet access when I was away. I was offshore, on a boat.\u201d The case continues.",

Shares in Mothercare crashed by more than 30% to an all-time low of 42.05p in early trading on Monday and closed down 27.5% at 45p. At this level, the company is valued at just \u00a377m. The chain said UK like-for-like sales had slumped by 7.2% in the 12 weeks to 30 December, with online sales falling 6.9%. Online sales make up 42% of its total UK sales; with two-fifths of digital sales coming from iPad purchases made in store. Mothercare is now predicting a pre-tax profit of \u00a31m to \u00a35m for its financial year to the end of March. The City had already expected profits to halve to \u00a310m from \u00a319.7m. The maternity and childrenswear specialist is the second big high street name to warn on profits after Debenhams said last week it would cut jobs and close more stores following a poor festive period. At least 20 retailers will reveal over the next few days how they performed over Christmas. Tesco is expected to be one of the winners, while Marks &amp; Spencer is still struggling. Both are due to issue their trading updates on Thursday alongside House of Fraser, which is seeking to cut the size of its stores to slash its rent bill after a tough Christmas. Mothercare had also been scheduled to report that day, but brought its statement forward. Neil Wilson, a senior market analyst at trading platform ETX Capital, said: \u201cClearly Mothercare et al are up against it and the update does not bode especially well for the retail sector ahead of an important week of releases.\u201d Mothercare has 143 stores in the UK, including four Early Learning Centre outlets, and a further 1,131 shops abroad. The international business posted a 3% fall in sales excluding currency effects, and a 6.8% decline in actual terms. However, sales declines in the Middle East levelled off and Russia returned to growth. The company blamed the profit warning on a slump in consumer demand since the end of September. It had been hoping to break even in the UK for the first time in seven years, but the downturn in spending means the UK business will remain loss-making. The Mothercare chief executive, Mark Newton-Jones, said: \u201cThere has been a softening in the UK market with lower footfall and website traffic resulting in lower spend in both stores and online. This trend has continued.\u201d He added that customers were waiting until promotional periods to shop. The firm\u2019s UK sales rose 8% during the 10-day Black Friday shopping bonanza and are up again during the post-Christmas sale. Newton-Jones defended the retailer\u2019s decision to hold off from discounting in the run-up to Christmas, unlike some rivals, and to slash prices more aggressively in the post-festive sale. He said Mothercare had 5-10% less stock than last year and would have run out of stock if had started its price cuts earlier. So far it has shifted 85% of clearance stock, compared with 60-70% in past years. This generates cash in the bank but profit margins will suffer. Since taking the helm three years ago, Newton-Jones has closed 100 loss-making UK outlets and modernised 70% of the remaining stores. Zoe Mills, retail analyst at data firm GlobalData, said: \u201cWhile the majority of its stores are now in the new club format, improving the store experience further is essential to return like-for-like sales to growth, with at least a 2% rise necessary for the fourth quarter to avoid a 2017-18 full-year decline. \u201cMoreover, it must utilise its stores to support the online channel and to differentiate itself from online competitors Amazon, PreciousLittleOne and Tesco Direct.\u201d \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers are more upbeat about the state of the global economy than at any time since 2014 and believe demand from overseas will sustain their businesses through another year of Brexit uncertainty, a survey has shown. The poll by the manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF and the insurance firm AIG found 40% of the companies questioned were planning for growth in 2018 while 19% were expecting a downturn in their business. Stronger growth in key export markets is expected to sustain order books, but the survey showed firms remained nervous about the outlook, with the balance of those seeing more risks than opportunities up from 23% in 2017 to 26% in 2018. Worries about the UK\u2019s planned exit from the EU will continue to dominate in 2018, according to the survey, which was conducted in November before the first phase of Brexit withdrawal negotiations were completed. Concerns were expressed about the effects of rising input costs, loss of staff from the rest of the EU, exchange rate volatility or a disruption in a large market. Even so, the EEF/AIG survey found businesses optimistic about the outlook. The confident mood in the boardroom was reflected in improvements across the survey, with all indicators \u2013 sales to UK and export customers, job numbers and profit margins \u2013 recording positive balances for the first time in three years. EEF\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Phipson, said: \u201cManufacturers left 2017 in an upbeat mood and are set to outpace the rest of the economy again this year as the growth in global trade continues to gain momentum. That is not to say everything in the 2018 garden is rosy, however, as there are plenty of factors that could puncture this positive picture. \u201cChief among these is Brexit which has put the investment outlook on a knife edge. As such, it is essential that the government gets a transition deal as a matter of urgency and sets out with utmost clarity as to what kind of final deal it is looking for. \u201cIn tandem with this it also needs to crack on a pace with its industrial strategy. This will be vital in providing manufacturers with the confidence to invest in strategies to improve their productivity and enter new markets.\u201d The EEF-AIG survey is in line with other reports from the UK manufacturing sector, which have shown that the acceleration in the global economy and the boost to exports from a weaker pound have helped swell order books. But despite higher levels of activity, the survey did not pick up any changes in sentiment towards investment, which fell sharply in the deep recession of 2008-09 and has grown sluggishly in the years since. Only a third of companies surveyed admit to making contingency plans for a no deal Brexit outcome and industry executives seem as likely to be considering reshoring as offshoring in the year ahead in response to Brexit and exchange rate risks. Firms said they expected to spend more money on product innovation and automation in order to increase productivity.

      "bodyText": "At least 20 retailers will reveal how they performed over the festive period this week, with Tesco expected to be one of the Christmas winners but Marks &amp; Spencer continuing to struggle. Others due to update investors include Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons , John Lewis, House of Fraser and fast-growing discounter B&amp;M. With little sales growth to be found, it is not expected to be a vintage year for any company as consumer confidence and spending power remains weak. But hopes of a good performance from online players such as Asos and Amazon, and those with a good delivery service such as Sainsbury\u2019s Argos and John Lewis, are boosted by data from Mastercard that indicates online spending rose 11.5% in December, compared with the same month in 2016. That drove an overall 2.2% rise in sales for December compared with last year, ramping up in the final days before Christmas, according to Mastercard. Last Wednesday, Next\u2019s shares soared after it reported slightly better than expected sales thanks to belated demand for coats and knitwear when snowy and icy weather hit much of the UK in December. But on Thursday, hopes of a retail fillip were dashed when Debenhams rushed out a profit warning. It said trading had been hit by heavy discounting on clothing and seasonal gifts with a particularly disappointing start to its post-Christmas sale. Kate Calvert, a retail analyst at Investec, said the different experiences of Debenhams and Next indicated that clothing chains which held back from early discounting may have fared better. That may potentially be good news for M&amp;S, which had fewer promotional days in 2017 than the year before, according to Calvert. But she still expects a \u201cmediocre\u201d performance from M&amp;S with clothing sales at established stores down by 3%. \u201cIt will be more like Next than Debenhams,\u201d she said. Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst, said M&amp;S\u2019s attempts to reduce costs were affecting the quality of its products and were proving unpopular with its generally older shoppers. \u201cThe M&amp;S customer is not interested in getting more inferior product for lower prices. They would rather pay a bit more to get something relevant and of decent quality,\u201d he said. The chain\u2019s food sales are also expected to have been lacklustre as it struggles to compete with rising competition on luxury foods from all the major supermarkets and even discounters Aldi and Lidl. The major chains are trying to fight inflation and the squeeze on shoppers\u2019 spare cash by tempting them to trade down from branded goods to cheaper own label ranges. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, expects M&amp;S to be \u201ca laggard\u201d among a more generally positive set of performances from British grocers. Tesco is expected to be the top performer with sales growth of as much as 3% over Christmas, as Black said the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket group had \u201cstabilised the business and got the basics right on availability and store standards\u201d. It remains to be seen which grocer will suffer the biggest hit from the surging sales of the discounters \u2013 Aldi said sales rose 15% in December as it opened stores and sold more of its more luxurious foods. Black said he believed Sainsbury\u2019s looked the weakest player after it suffered from \u201cgaps on shelves\u201d and an unexciting store environment during the run-up to Christmas.",

It said trading had been hit by heavy discounting on clothing and seasonal gifts with a particularly disappointing start to its post-Christmas sale.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/05/debenhams-job-cuts-and-store-closures-likely-after-disappointing-sales\">Debenhams job cuts and store closures likely after disappointing sales</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kate Calvert, a retail analyst at Investec, said the different experiences of Debenhams and Next indicated that clothing chains which held back from early discounting may have fared better. That may potentially be good news for M&amp;S, which had fewer promotional days in 2017 than the year before, according to Calvert. But she still expects a \u201cmediocre\u201d performance from M&amp;S with clothing sales at established stores down by 3%. \u201cIt will be more like Next than Debenhams,\u201d she said.</p> <p> Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst, said M&amp;S\u2019s attempts to reduce costs were affecting the quality of its products and were proving unpopular with its generally older shoppers. \u201cThe M&amp;S customer is not interested in getting more inferior product for lower prices. They would rather pay a bit more to get something relevant and of decent quality,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The chain\u2019s food sales are also expected to have been lacklustre as it struggles to compete with rising competition on luxury foods from all the major supermarkets and even discounters Aldi and Lidl. The major chains are trying to fight inflation and the squeeze on shoppers\u2019 spare cash by tempting them to trade down from branded goods to cheaper own label ranges. </p> <p>Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, expects M&amp;S to be \u201ca laggard\u201d among a more generally positive set of performances from British grocers.</p> <p> </p> <p>Tesco is expected to be the top performer with sales growth of as much as 3% over Christmas, as Black said the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket group had \u201cstabilised the business and got the basics right on availability and store standards\u201d.</p> <p>It remains to be seen which grocer will suffer the biggest hit from the surging sales of the discounters \u2013 Aldi said sales rose 15% in December as it opened stores and sold more of its more luxurious foods. Black said he believed Sainsbury\u2019s looked the weakest player after it suffered from \u201cgaps on shelves\u201d and an unexciting store environment during the run-up to Christmas.</p>",

      "bodyText": "New Look is coming under fresh pressure after an insurer stopped selling cover against insolvency to its suppliers, in the latest sign of difficulties for retailers amid a squeeze on consumers\u2019 spending power. The troubles for the high-street fashion chain come after a difficult Christmas for many leading retailers. Credit insurer Euler Hermes is understood to have halted the sale of protection against insolvency to suppliers of New Look, although is still expected to cover any shipments with protection signed before it made the decision to stop fresh sales. The Sunday Times, which first reported the story, said another insurer had reduced coverage levels to suppliers of New Look, but had not withdrawn sales altogether. Credit insurance protects suppliers against the risk of a customer going bust during the period between an order being accepted and payment being made. The loss of such protections can have disastrous consequences for a retailer, having played a part in the demise of high-street names such as Woolworths, Focus DIY and Zavvi. Without cover, retailers can struggle to buy sufficient levels of supplies or can be forced to accept more onerous payment terms. New Look, which has a debt pile of more than \u00a31bn, has seen a drop-off in sales in recent months, with revenue falling by 4.5% to \u00a3686m in the six months to 23 September. The company said at the time it had access to \u00a3242.5m in cash, which it said was \u201cadequate\u201d for its needs despite tough trading conditions. Controlled by the South African tycoon Christo Wiese through his Brait private equity vehicle, the company received another blow in December when the credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s downgraded its debt to junk status. Wiese resigned from the board of South African retailer Steinhoff last month, where he was the largest shareholder, after accounting irregularities came to light. Steinhoff is also the parent company of Poundland, which had seen an insurer cut the level of coverage to its suppliers last month. The discount chain said at the time it was \u201cprofitable, cash-generating and trading very strongly\u201d. New Look is attempting to stage a turnaround, after rehiring former executive chairman Alistair McGeorge to help stem falling sales. He is expected to give an update on the firm\u2019s strategy early next month alongside its latest sales update, which will include the key Christmas shopping period. New Look and Euler Hermes declined to comment.",
