      "bodyText": "Women need to \"grab some pompoms and start cheering\" for their \"sisters\" if they want to do more to create an equal society, according to an article by an influential Labour MP published to on Thursday. Stella Creasy, the shadow minister for business, argues that the scarcity of women in top jobs is not just to do with sexism but women holding themselves back and lacking confidence. Writing for Red magazine, the Walthamstow MP, who is considered a rising star from the 2010 intake of parliamentarians, says it can be frustrating to watch \"amazing women we know hold themselves back from applying to do something because they think they're not good enough\". SheCreasy said the problem is about more than changing the attitude of employers: \"Taking on the sexist dinosaurs who overlook female ability is only half the story. We also need to build the confidence of women so they are ready and raring to go.\" She writes that there were times when she of opportunities, like not going for the directorship of a charity because she was worried people would not take her seriously. She said women need \"cheerleaders\" who would \"build waves of positive, powerful support to stop hesitation from standing in the way of our success\". Speaking of the need for women to help other women, Creasy says: \"Boosting someone else's plans to be ambitious can also make you realise just how high you could reach, too. In the sport of cheerleading itself, the 'flyer' is the athlete at the top of the routine. \"They can't get there without the rest of the troupe lifting them.\" And the team can't perform without them. Just as in life, mutual strength lifts each of us, so we can soar to the heights of which we're all capable \u2026 So, sisters, grab your pompoms and start cheering for someone else's future \u2013 you may be surprised at the actions it inspires in you.\" She says there have been just 369 female MPs in the history of parliament, fewer than theagainst 503 male MPs in the current parliament. \"At the present rate of change, a child born in 2014 will be drawing her pension before she sees the same number of men and women making decisions on how her country is run,\" she said. Her remarks come after David Cameron blamed Nick Clegg for the government's failure to live up to its promises on promoting more women. The prime minister has blamed the Lib Dems for not been \"pulling their weight\" when it comes to appointing female ministers. Tackled on the government's failings, Cameron hinted that he would give more senior jobs to women in the next reshuffle but suggested the problem was mostly the deputy prime minister's fault for not having any female Lib Dem cabinet ministers. There are now just three women among 22 cabinet ministers running departments since the resignation of Maria Miller, the culture secretary, following the row over her expenses.\"What I said is I wanted to see a third of my front bench ministers being women at the end of a Conservative government,\" Cameron told MPs. \"We have made some important progress in terms of the numbers of people on the front bench. \"I have to say, with respect to my coalition partner, that in terms of Cabinet numbers the Liberal Democrats need to do a bit more to pull their weight on this issue. But I hope to be making further progress.\" His remarks about the Liberal Democrats were rebuffed by Lorely Burt, MP for Solihull, who told the prime minister: \"Lib Dem women not only pull their weight but punch above their weight.\" \u2022 The full interview appears in the June 2014 issue of Red, on sale 1 May.

    "webTitle": "Morrisons cuts price of 1,200 products in bid to win customers back", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A supermarket price war will move a step closer on Thursday as struggling Morrisons slashes the price of more than 1,200 products in an attempt to regain customers lost to cheaper discount chains. Bradford-based Morrisons is cutting the price of big brands including Hovis, Diet Coke and Tate &amp; Lyle sugar as well as fresh produce and own-label goods. The average price cut will be 17%. The move will increase the pressure on rivals Tesco and Sainsbury's, which analysts say will now be forced to respond as Morrisons moves on from reducing prices on a handful of basics such as milk to a whole trolley of well-known branded items where it is easy to compare the price tag in different stores. Morrisons, which has seen sales slump in recent months, will also attempt to win back customers with six new TV adverts, using the strapline \"I'm your new cheaper Morrisons\", and is paying \u00a3600,000 for a wraparound advert in the Sun. Morrisons said 40% of its price cuts will be on branded goods, with the rest on own-label items from sausages to butter. The company is being battered by what it has described as the biggest upheaval in the grocery market since the 1950s. Cash-strapped consumers are looking to save money by shopping around and wasting less. Shoppers have also dramatically changed their buying habits, with a rapid move away from doing one big weekly shop to buying more regularly in local convenience stores or online. The discount chains have seen their business soar as shoppers hunt for bargains. Aldi's sales are up 35% on last year, while Lidl is up 17%. At the premium end, Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer have also made advances, while the big middle-market chains are losing out. Dalton Philips, Morrisons' chief executive, said the grocery industry was undergoing the same kind of transformation as seen in the airline business, where low-cost alternatives have hit the big traditional market leaders. He warned that the big grocers had to respond or pay a heavy price. He said: \"Our lower prices are not just for the next week or next month. Morrisons is going to be cheaper permanently on the products which matter most to our customers. This is not a temporary skirmish.\" Last month, Morrisons warned that its profits would halve as it spent \u00a31bn on price cuts and product improvements over the coming three years. That move slashed \u00a32bn off the stockmarket value of the UK's three listed supermarkets in a single day as investors took fright. Since then all the supermarkets have been forced to follow Morrisons' lead on cutting the price of basics and discounters have also fought back with a series of price cuts. However, Philips could not promise that Morrisons' prices would now match those of the discounters or even its bigger rival Asda, and he admitted it could take some time before the chain would begin to see better sales at the tills. With shoppers increasingly sceptical about the barrage of promotional offers and price changes at supermarkets, which often cut prices only to put them up again later, Morrisons will also try to win back trust by enabling shoppers to monitor future price changes on 1,200 items via its website in a partnership with price comparison site MySupermarket.com. Philips insisted Morrisons' price cuts would not come at the expense of suppliers or quality, but by reducing the number of unpopular promotions by about 20% and saving money by processing more food through its own packing plants and abattoirs.",

      "bodyText": "Scandal-hit outsourcing company Serco \u2013 the business embroiled in controversy over billing the government for electronically tagging prisoners who had died \u2013 has parted company with its finance director after unveiling plans to raise an emergency \u00a3170m by selling new shares. The company, whose new chief executive Rupert Soames is due to start work on Thursday, issued a statement to the London Stock Exchange after the market closed revealing the departure of Andrew Jenner, the group's chief financial officer since 2002. Serco, which runs services ranging from prisons to rail franchises and London's cycle hire scheme, said it would be \"uncomfortably close\" to breaching its banking agreements and intended to sell nearly 50m new shares to raise cash. It was the second late-night statement in a week from Serco, whose previous chief executive Chris Hyman departed with a \u00a31.6m payoff last autumn. On Monday night, the firm issued an unexpected profits warning, telling investors that its profits would now fall far short of expectations and it needed an urgent injection of cash. The \u00a3170m is the maximum amount of new shares it can issue and is less than had been predicted. The alternative, however, would have been to ask all its existing investors to participate in a much bigger fundraising through a rights issue with no certainty of success. Serco said the cash would be used to finance the business while Soames spends nine months assessing the extent of the problems it faces and comes up with a new strategy. The outsourcing group outlined a catalogue of problems, including contract losses, lower margins, loss of efficiency and restructuring. The issues span its interests from Australia to the US and Europe. Soames said: \"The proposed equity placing has a single purpose: to give us the opportunity to conduct a thorough review of the strategy of the business whilst remaining within the terms of our debt facilities.\" The group's shares hit a 10-year high of 683p last July but they closed \u2013 before the latest announcement \u2013 at 340p. The company, which has already warned it will take a big hit to profits as a result of the tagging scandal, said its performance this year had been \"more challenging than expected\". Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill, has been meeting shareholders in private in recent days and will address analysts for the first time on Thursday. Serco, which suffered a 62% fall in profits last year, warned that profits would fall a further 20% this year. The firm is still being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office and has suffered from a ban on being awarded new contracts by the UK government that ran until January. It laid off 400 staff and took a \u00a390m charge, most of which related to a financial settlement with the government. It has already warned that more job losses could follow. Serco warned last month that its order book had shrunk by \u00a32bn to \u00a31.7bn and its debt had increased by 21% to \u00a3700m. It says that debt level will reach \u00a3800m by the end of this year. Jenner, who has been in the business for 17 years, will stay until a successor is found. Chairman Alistair Lyons said the finance director had \"made a significant contribution through his personal commitment to the company\".",

      "bodyText": "The investment bank that advised the government not to increase the price of Royal Mail shares, despite widespread fears they were hugely undervalued, made a profit of more than \u00a38m by immediately selling the company's stock in the wake of its controversial privatisation, a parliamentary commitee was told. Lazard, which was paid \u00a31.5m by the government for flotation advice, followed its own recommendation and bought 6m shares at 330p each on the day of the float but sold them within 48 hours at 470p to reap a profit of \u00a38.4m. Margaret Hodge, chair of the parliamentary public accounts committee (PAC), said Lazard \"made a killing at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer that lost \u00a3750m on day one\" of Royal Mail's London Stock Exchange debut. An official report by the National Audit Office last month found that the government decided against increasing the flotation price of Royal Mail beyond 330p-a-share because of warnings from Lazard's corporate advisory arm, Lazard &amp; Co, that City funds would be put off. On the day of the flotation, on 11 October, the shares rocketed 38% due to phenomenal demand from the City and public. They gained \u00a3750m in value in the biggest one-day rise in a privatisation since British Airways in 1987. The shares, which continued to rise to a peak of 615p, are now trading at 530p. During the sale Lazard &amp; Co advised the government to sell the shares as cheaply as 212p. Other banks valued the shares as high as 510p, with none reckoning they were worth less than 300p.

He said there were Chinese walls preventing one half of the business from knowing what the other half was doing. Denying any wrongdoing, Rucker pointed out that the \u00a38.4m profit was made on behalf of clients rather than for Lazard Asset Management itself. Lazard Asset Management was one of 16 investors given \"priority investor\" status that allowed them to buy bigger chunks of Royal Mail in the hope that they would stay with the company through thick and thin. However, six of the investors sold all of their shares almost immediately and a further six had sold most of their stake within weeks. The list, which was published by Cable on Wednesday following a long campaign by politicians and the media, revealed that three aggressive hedge funds were given the \"golden ticket\" status despite the business secretary's pledge that Royal Mail would not fall into the hands of \"spivs and speculators\".

    "webTitle": "Co-op Bank report hits out at poor management and overambition", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Poor management, bad lending, a flawed culture and an overambitious drive for growth contributed to the problems at the Co-operative Bank, according to a scathing report which has concluded that the bank should never have merged with the Britannia Building Society five years ago. The 152-page report by Sir Christopher Kelly, a former top civil servant, provides the most detailed account yet of the events that led to the bank's near-collapse last year and left the Co-operative Group of supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies with just a 30% stake in its once-flagship banking operations. Kelly described the chaos that engulfed the Co-op bank as a \"sorry story\" and expressed surprise that the Co-op Bank ever attempted to take over 631 branches being sold by Lloyds Banking Group, a deal that was codenamed name Project Verde and abandoned last year. The much-anticipated report, which cost \u00a34.4m, is likely to make painful reading for former and some current members of the boards of both the Co-op Group and Co-op bank, as Kelly makes plain they need to take responsibility for the bank's problems. He refused to single out individuals for blame, but painted a picture of a bank that did not have a chief executive with the correct experience to run it until last year and the overall Group being without a strategy, other than a mantra about \"scale and ethics\". Kelly found no evidence of political interference on either the Britannia deal or the Verde transaction. \"This report tells a sorry story of failings in management and governance on many levels,\" said Kelly, who was commissioned to write the report by both the bank and the group in July 2013. He is estimated to have received \u00a3240,000 for his work. \"The roots of the shortfall lie in a merger between the bank and the Britannia building society which probably should never have happened. Both organisations had problems. Bringing them together exacerbated these problems. It might have worked if the failed management team had received first-class leadership. Sadly it did not,\" he said. The report sets out nine reasons for its crisis - including the economic environment and an industry-wide requirement to raise more capital - as well as 15 \"far from novel\" lessons.

      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline has distanced itself from a white-knight bid for rival British drugs maker AstraZeneca, which has received an unwanted \u00a360bn takeover approach from Pfizer of the US. GSK's chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, has repeatedly expressed scepticism about \"mega deals\", which he says can lumber companies with unwanted businesses. He said on Wednesday that GSK \u2013 Britain's largest drugmaker \u2013 was focused on the complex swap of assets with Switzerland's Novartis announced last week. \"What we are focused on is ensuring that our organisation is not distracted in the core R&amp;D business,\" he said. \"We committed ourselves to the Novartis deal. It wasn't easy to negotiate, and we're committed to bringing this to life.\" The deal, which swaps GSK's cancer division for Novartis' vaccines business and pools the companies' consumer healthcare units, has taken months to put together. \"Sometimes the traditional [mergers and acquisitions] approach is a little bit easier,\" he added. \"Different managers have different time horizons.\" Asked whether GSK would pick up any businesses that might be offloaded after a potential AstraZeneca-Pfizer tie-up, Witty said: \"We're not really sat here opportunistically waiting for things like that. They would have to fit our strategy. We are always in the market for great talent.\" His comments came as Pfizer's chief executive, Ian Read, mounted a charm offensive with UK government officials. While Downing Street has adopted a neutral stance, the chairman of the business select committee, Adrian Bailey, has demanded an investigation of the mooted deal. It would be the biggest foreign takeover of a British company and, he said, \"could threaten the UK's strategic interests\". The committee is likely to discuss this at its next meeting next Tuesday. \"We are keen to look closely at it,\" committee member Ann McKechin told Reuters. \"The committee previously had a great deal of concern over the Cadbury takeover [by Kraft], so I think this is one we will really have to closely analyse what is on offer,\" she said. AstraZeneca shareholders want the company to engage with Pfizer. In a veiled dig at Viagra maker Pfizer, which has refused to guarantee UK jobs, and shut the bulk of its Sandwich research site in 2011 with the loss of more than 1,500 jobs, Witty said: \"We have not held back in being unashamedly committed to Britain \u2026 There is a terrific science space here. The UK has over the last six to seven years done a lot to improve the investment environment.\" He pointed to the patent box \u2013 a lucrative tax break for new drugs developed in the UK, which has also caught Pfizer's eye. By 2017, companies will pay 10% tax on profits derived from UK-held patents, which is half the corporation tax rate of 21%. Meanwhile, GSK reported a 10% drop in first-quarter sales to \u00a35.6bn. Takeup of its new lung drug, Breo, has been slow. Sales in China continued to fall amid a damaging bribery scandal. The drugmaker abandoned its guidance of 2% sales growth at constant currency rates for the year, preferring to predict that there will be sales growth without giving a specific number.",

In fact, the second quarter will most likely see a decent bounce from this weakness, even though headline forecasts for 2014 are likely to be revised down as a result of this poor start. We may now be looking at something a shade below 3.0%.</p> <p>We don\u2019t expect the [Fed] will care about this GDP figure very much, and look for the $10bn taper to proceed along its previous path at today\u2019s meeting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-04-30T12:56:36.523Z\">at 1.56pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5360f1b3e4b05034061a995e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-30T12:52:01.839Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The weak US GDP data is a sharp contrast with the UK economy, which grew by 0.8% in the last quarter.</p> <p><i>And on that note I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher.</i></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-04-30T12:53:10.959Z\">at 1.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5360f09de4b09c86f129e7d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-04-30T12:50:54.503Z\">1.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/30/china-to-overtake-us-economy-co-op-bank-eurozone-inflation-live?view=desktop#block-5360ec81e4b09c86f129e7d3\">So why was US growth so weak last quarter</a>?

Back with the Royal Mail committee and Margaret Hodge has returned the subject of potential conflicts of interest: And with that, the hearing wraps up. Some early snaps from the Treasury Select Committee confirmation hearings for Bank of England monetary policy committee members Andy Haldane and Spencer Dale.

Economists had been expecting growth of closer to 1%. The figures represent the Commerce Department\u2019s first take on GDP for the three months from January to March and will be revised as more information becomes available. They come as the Federal Reserve ends its two-day meeting amid expectations that it will make further cuts to its massive bond-buying economic stimulus programme, known as quantitative easing. Capital Economics\u2019 chief US economist Paul Ashworth had been expecting growth of around 1.2%. He said the gap between the forecasts and the surprisingly weak figure was principally due to the impact of the winter\u2019s severe weather, an unexpected 5.5% decline in investment in equipment and the complete absence of any rebound in government spending after the federal shutdown in the fourth-quarter of last year. His full report on the US GDP figures is here: US economy grows just 0.1% as weather blamed for putting chill on recovery Lazard made around \u00a38m by immediately selling its \u00a320m worth of shares. Back with the Royal Mail, and Lazard - one of the government's advisors - has admitted it sold all the shares it was allocated almost immediately. Earlier Lazard was asked whether it was appropriate that its asset management arm received 6m of the 13m shares for initial investors, when Lazard was an advisor. Chief executive William Rucker says when it was appointed it was unaware Lazard Asset Management has previously had discussions with Royal Mail. He added: When we learned this, we made it clear we should have no discussions about allocations. Ahead of next week's European Central Bank meeting there has been much speculation as to whether it will sanction a rate cut or even quantitative easing. But according to a report on Bloomberg, ECB president Mario Draghi believes a QE programme may not be needed in the near term: Draghi told German lawmakers that a quantitative-easing program isn\u2019t imminent and is relatively unlikely for now, according to a euro-area official present at the meeting. The central bank stands ready to embark on QE if needed, Draghi said at the gathering attended by lawmakers from parties that form the nation\u2019s coalition government, the official told reporters yesterday. The person declined to be identified because the meeting in Koenigswinter, Germany, was private. Draghi has said he is considering unprecedented measures from negative interest rates to QE to avert the risk of deflation as he guides the euro area through a gradual economic recovery. Government and central-bank officials in Germany, the region\u2019s largest economy, have been among the strongest opponents of his more radical policies amid concern the ECB will overstep its mandate. After the surprisingly weak US GDP figures comes a better than expected reading on business activity in the mid-west. The ISM Chicago index came in at 63 for April, its highest level since October 2013. That compares with 55.9 in March and a forecast of 56.7. Back with zero hours, and the Guardian Datablog has published detailed information on the figures released from the ONS: New data on zero-hours contracts adds to a worrying picture The latest group up before the committee to discuss the Royal Mail float are: James Robertson, Managing Director, UBS Limited, William Rucker, Chief Executive, Lazard and Co, Alan Custis, Managing Director, UK Equities, Lazard Asset Management, and Richard Cormack, Managing Director, Co-Head of Equity Capital Markets, Goldman Sachs Martin Donnelly, Permanent Secretary, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and Mark Russell, Chief Executive, Shareholder Executive, and Roger Lowe, Director, Royal Mail and Post Office Unit, Shareholder Executive A live feed is available here. Ahead of the latest Public Accounts Committee hearing on the Royal Mail, Vince Cable has released the names of the 16 priority investors in the company's flotation. They are: Abu Dhabi Investment Authority BlackRock Capital Research Fidelity Worldwide GIC Henderson JP Morgan Kuwait Investment Office Lansdowne Partners Lazard Asset Management Och Ziff Schroders Soros Standard Life Third Point Threadneedle Cable said the 16 gave the government the confidence to launch the float and were later allocated shares: I told the BIS Select Committee yesterday I wanted to be as helpful and transparent as possible. In that spirit I had already provided the names to the National Audit Office and yesterday I provided the list in confidence to the chairs of the BIS Select Committee and the Public Accounts Committee. I had been advised that the investors expected confidentiality around their share acquisitions but there has been strong interest in who the investors are and speculation around the names, some of it inaccurate. I have decided the public has an interest in an accurate list being available. There was controversy as some of the initial investors sold out almost immediately, making huge profits as the shares soared 38% on the first day of trading. The weak US GDP figure is unlikely to dissuade the Federal Reserve from continuing to taper its bond buying programme. The Fed will unveil its latest decision later, but is expected to cut its stimulus measures by another $10bn. Rob Carnell at ING Bank said: US first quarter 2014 GDP was a disappointment if you focus solely on the headline figure. But the market was already geared up for weakness given awful first quarter weather (consensus was for about 1.0%) and the real excitement this week will be today\u2019s FOMC decision and Friday\u2019s payrolls. This is history, and tells us little about the underlying state of the US economy. In fact, the second quarter will most likely see a decent bounce from this weakness, even though headline forecasts for 2014 are likely to be revised down as a result of this poor start. We may now be looking at something a shade below 3.0%. We don\u2019t expect the [Fed] will care about this GDP figure very much, and look for the $10bn taper to proceed along its previous path at today\u2019s meeting. The weak US GDP data is a sharp contrast with the UK economy, which grew by 0.8% in the last quarter. And on that note I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. So why was US growth so weak last quarter? Today's report shows that US companies struggled to sell goods overseas, with exports tumbling 7.6%. Business investment also fell, down 2.1% after rising over 5% in the final quarter of last year. Firms also cut their inventories back. As Reuters puts it: After aggressively restocking in the second half of 2013, businesses accumulated $87.4 billion worth of inventory in the first quarter, the smallest amount since the second quarter of 2013. However, consumer spending remained strong - up 3% during the quarter, which may suggest the recovery is still on track. The US economy barely grew at all in the first three months of this year. The Bureau of Labour Statistics just reported that GDO rose by just 0.1% in the first quarter, on an annualised basis (so jus 0.025% in quarterly terms). That's the weakest reading since the last quarter of 2012, and much worse than economists had expected , even allowing for the impact of the bad winter weather. The concensus was for growth of 1.2% annualised, (or 0.3% on a quarterly basis) There's shock in the City, and on Wall Street.... Details and reaction to follow.... While Britain's housing market roars away, it's a shakier picture in Europe's weaker economies. So warns Standard &amp; Poor's in a new report on the housing sector. S&amp;P economist Sophie Tahiri said house prices appear to be stabilising across Europe, warning: \"But a recovery is still some way off for some markets in the eurozone that were worst affected by the economic downturn, such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy, amid still tight credit conditions and high household debt,\" S&amp;P predicts UK house prices will rise by 7% this year as the \"impressive upturn\" continues, but will cool when the Bank of England raises interest rates next year It also believes German house prices will rally this year too... with prices rising by 4.5% on average this year, backed by low unemployment, rising consumer confidence, and increasing immigration. We nevertheless see no prospect of a housing bubble since price rises have occurred from a fairly low base. The Bundesbank has recently expressed concern over rising German housing prices. Strong jobs data from America just hit the wires -- its private sector created 220,000 new jobs this month. That's a higher reading than expected; economists had pencilled in 210k. It may suggest that Friday's Non-Farm Payroll, which measures the whole US labour market, will show a solid rise in employment this month. Britain's defeat in the European Courts of Justice over the eurozone Robin Hood tax this morning (details here) has been welcomed by tax campaigners, but attacked by UKIP. David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says the UK should never have tried to block a European Financial Transaction Tax, arguing: \"George Osborne has gone to Europe to bat for the bankers, but he's been bowled first ball. \"This futile legal challenge tells you all you need to know about the Government's misguided priorities: it would rather defend a privileged elite in the City than support a tax that could raise billions to tackle poverty and protect public services. \"Instead of trying to stop other countries taxing their financial sectors, our Government should follow their lead, stand up to vested interests and harness the City's excessive wealth for the wider benefit of society. \"Complaining that the City will be hit by a European FTT is a clear case of double standards - almost half of the \u00a33bn revenue from our own FTT, the stamp duty on shares, comes from non-UK residents.\" While UKIP chief Nigel Farage took the opposite line - blasting the \"antagonistic federalist\" ECJ: \"It shows Cameron's argument that the UK government can negotiate a better deal for British business from within the EU as a fraud and a farce. The only way to protect the UK financial interest is to withdraw from the tax-hungry EU and stop giving Brussels power over us. Here's Larry Elliott's full story: UK opposition to financial transaction tax rejected Ireland's jobless rate has fallen to its lowest level in five years, dipping to 11.7% this month from 11.8% in March. The Central Statistics Office reported a 3,400 drop in the number of people claiming unemployment benefit. It's the 22nd consecutive fall, down from the record high of 15% in 2002. Merrion economist Alan McQuaid said that more jobs were being created as Ireland's economy improves, although emigration from the country - which completed its three-year bailout programme last December - also pushed the jobless rate down. Economist Shaun Richards has analysed the zero hours contracts research too (and possibly the 1980s Hit Parade as well), and writes: Firstly if I can ask you to take a journey in Dr.Who\u2019s TARDIS and \u201cStep Back in Time\u201d as Kylie Minogue has suggested then a decade or so ago economic literature was full of articles suggesting that the UK labour market needs to become more flexible. As this is an example of that we are left wondering if this is an example of the aphorism \u201cBe careful what you wish for!\u201d He also flag ups up that zero hours employees are more likely than average to be doing less work then they'd like: What is needed now is much research into the wages area I think so that as well as quantity of work we find out at what price it is being carried out. Frankly we still know much too little about this area. Fortunately some of the worst scaremongering has turned out to be mostly untrue but that does not mean that everything is as it should be. More here: What is the state of play with Zero Hours Contracts in the UK? Chuka Umunna MP, Labour's Shadow Business Secretary, wants exploitative zero-hours contracts banned. Here's take on today's ONS report into the issue. \u201cThese shocking figures show that since David Cameron became Prime Minister, there has been huge increase in the number of people on zero hours contracts. It is staggering illustration of the cost-of-living crisis under this Tory led Government and a reminder that David Cameron and George Osborne are failing to deliver a balanced recovery that works for all. \u201cLabour is clear that we will outlaw zero-hours contracts where they exploit people, ensuring that people at work are protected and get a fair deal. It's time the Tory-led government matched our plans.\u201d Unions have called for a crackdown on companies using zero hours contracts unfairly, following the news that there are 1.4m zero-hours contracts being used in the UK . Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said these contracts trap people in a world of insecure, low paid work, where \"your future income is dependent on the whim of your boss\". \u201cIt is clear that that workers in the UK need stronger legal protection \u2013 not less as the government claims \u2013 to protect them against abuses. They need legal rights to challenge abuses and not be charged \u00a31,200 to take a case to an employment tribunal. \u201cIt is time for ministers to take action and ensure that all goods and services that government departments procure should be from outside organisations and companies that don\u2019t use zero hours contracts. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says that zero hours contracts are more endemic across the UK economy than previously admitted. \u201cInsecure work with no guarantee of regular paid hours is no longer confined to the fringes of the jobs market. \u201cIt is worrying that so many young people are trapped on zero-hours contracts, which can hold back their careers and make it harder to pay off debts like student loans. The fact that these contracts have become the norm in tourism, catering and food will be a major concern for the millions of people employed in these industries. \u201cWith a further 1.3m workers reportedly doing no work at all, the jobs market is far more precarious than the government would have us believe. This should spur ministers into action to crackdown on the abuse of zero-hours contracts by employers.\u201d Recent TUC research also found that a majority of those on zero-hours contracts are paid less than the living wage. My colleague Angela Monaghan has analysed today's report into the use of zero hours contracts by British firms, and writes: The number of UK jobs offered on zero-hours contracts is 1.4m, according to the latest government figures, a far higher number than expected. A snapshot survey of employers by the Office for National Statistics, taken from a two week period between late January and early February, showed the trend for hiring staff without guaranteeing a minimum number of hours is more prevalent than initially thought. Following an earlier survey of employees, the ONS had previously estimated that 583,000 people were employed on zero hours, suggesting that some people have more than job on a zero-hours basis. Full story: More than 1 million UK workers on zero-hours contracts Today's weaker-than-expected eurozone inflation data won't prompt the European Central Bank to launch a quantitative easing programme soon, says Gary Jenkins, economist at LNG Capital: Credit Agricole's Frederik Ducrozet says the ECB should cut rates this summer: After an early dip, though, the euro is rallied a little - suggesting traders don't expect a rate cut soon. Martin van Vliet of ING argues the ECB will hold rates at its next meeting. He writes: The lower-than-expected Eurozone inflation reading for April will fuel speculation of further monetary easing by the ECB at next\u2019s week policy meeting. However, we doubt whether the ECB will pull the trigger just yet. Eurostat\u2019s \u201cflash\u201d estimate came in at 0.7%, slightly below the 0.8% consensus, but still 0.2ppt higher than in March. The bounce in inflation was partly due to less negative energy price inflation (-1.2% versus -2.1%), but also reflected a sharp increase in the core rate, from 0.7% to 1.0%. Food, alcohol and tobacco inflation eased from 1.0% to 0.7%. The sharp increase in core inflation can be largely blamed on the impact from the timing of Easter. With Easter falling in March last year, but in April this year, the annual rate of change in holiday-related prices was abnormally low last month, and abnormally high this month. Excluding this effect, overall inflation would have been stable at 0.6% in both March and April. Inflation in the eurozone has rise this month, but by rather less than expected. Eurostat reports that inflation across the euro area rate rose by 0.7% in April, on an annual basis, up from 0.5% in March. Economists had expected a higher reading, of 0.8% or more (the Easter holiday break usually pushes inflation up, as higher demand for transport pushes prices up ). At just 0.7%, eurozone is well below the European Central Bank's target of close to, but below 2%. Today's figures will probably fuel concerns that Europe risks sinking into a deflationary slump. However, falling energy costs continued to drag inflation down, while prices across the Service sector jumped this month. Core inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco, rose to 1.0% -- which might deter the ECB from easing monetary policy again soon..... Many workers may be happy to be on a zero-hours contract, of course..... The true scale of Britain's zero-hours culture has been exposed, with an official survey finding 1.4 million contracts that don't guarantee a minimum amount of paid work each week. That's more than twice as many as previously estimated by the UK's statistics body, which hadn't examined the situation in detail until today. The Office for National Statistics has reported that almost half of all firms in tourism, catering and food sectors use \"non-guaranteed hours contracts\", which have been criticised for leaving people without a guaranteed income. Around 13% of UK firms use them, including one in five health and social work firms, it said. Larger employers were much more likely to use zero-hours contracts than smaller ones, the ONS said -- with almost half of businesses with 250 or more employees make some use of NGHCs. Today's figures are based on a two-week survey of the labour market, in late January and early February 2014. Zero-hours contracts has been a big issue in the last year, sparked by a big Guardian investigation into the situation. Until today, the only official estimate was that 583,000 people were on zero-hours contracts. As well as the 1.4m zero-hours contracts, the ONS found \"evidence of a further 1.3 million contracts where no work was undertaken\". That might mean there are more than 1.4m on zero hour contracts, it added. Update: Some people will have signed up for more than one zero hours contract each, so this isn't strictly a measure of the number of people working them - although it's probably pretty close. The ONS report is online here. George Osborne's decision to give Brits more control over their hard-earned pension pots has hit Standard Life's annuity business, hard. It reported this morning that annuity sales have halved since March's Budget, suggesting many people plan to use their savings for other investments. Or even a Lamborghini.... Standard Life's chief executive David Nish has criticised the way the changes were announced -- a classic 'rabbit out of a hat' moment at the end of the chancellors speech, my colleague Julia Kollewe reports: Nish said: \"The changes are very important and in many ways very positive for customers.\" But he criticised the way they were announced, which he said gave customers the sense that annuities were not worth having. People with pension pots worth less than \u00a310,000 were withdrawing their money, while those with larger pension pots are deferring the decision, Nish adds. Germany's labour market continues to strengthen -- with joblessness falling for the fifth month in a row in Europe's largest economy. The German unemployment total fell by 25,000, in seasonally adjusted terms, to 2.872m. The unemployment rate remained steady at 6.7%, compared to a eurozone average of 11.9%. George Osborne's attempt to block European countries introducing a financial transaction tax has just been rejected by the European Court of Justice. Europe's top court slapped down the chancellor's efforts to block the FTT, or Robin Hood tax -- which would impose a small levy on various financial trades. Britain had asked the ESJ to rule against 11 countries who have agreed to implement the FTT. But the ECJ refused, saying that it would not block a tax that had not actually been agreed yet. In a statement, it said: \"The Court dismisses the United Kingdom's action,\" \"The Court finds that the contested decision does no more than authorise the establishment of enhanced cooperation, but does not contain any substantive element on the FTT itself.\" Britain's government fears that the FTT will hit trading in the City, even though the UK is not signing up to the scheme. Supporters, such as France, argue that it will help dampen financial speculation - and raise billions in revenue. The Co-op Group's top brass have accepted the Kelly report's findings, and vowed not to repeat the mistakes of their predecessors: It's another dark day for Britain's battered Co-operative Group, as the official report into the crisis at its Bank is published. The 152-page report by Sir Christopher Kelly, a former civil servant, confirms that Co-op Bank's takeover of Britannia Building Society was a serious blunder, leading to its near collapse. As City editor Jill Treanor reports: Concluding that the landmark merger with Britannia in 2009 should probably not have taken place, Kelly also expresses surprise that the Co-op Bank attempted to take over 632 branches being sold by Lloyds Banking Group, a deal that was codenamed name Project Verde. The much-anticipated report, which cost \u00a34.4m, is likely to make painful reading for former and some current members of the boards of both the Co-op Group and Co-op Bank, as Kelly makes plain they need to take responsibility for the bank's problems. But it may come as a relief to the politicians on all sides of the spectrum who have been dragged into the affair, as Kelly finds no evidence of interference on either the Britannia deal or the Verde transaction. Co-op Bank report hits out at poor management and over-ambition Spain's statistics body confirmed this morning that the Spanish economy is growing at the fastest pace in six years. Spanish GDP rose by 0.4% in the first three month of this year - in line with the Bank of Spain's estimate last week. And on a year-on-year basis, the economy is 0.6% bigger - a little larger than expected. The new International Comparisons report has also found that the economies of Japan and the United Kingdom are smaller (compared to the US), than in 2005. Germany is a bit bigger, and France and Italy remained the same. The report also confirms that, on a per capita basis (GDP divided by population), America leads the way, with China languishing in mid-table. Economist Branko Milanovic has been tweeting masses of interesting facts about the new International Comparison report. Here's a few of the best: The World Bank has uploaded the full report to its website (pdf). The Economist has a good take on today's figures, saying that The American Century is ending, , and the Pacific Century beginning Until 1890 China was the world\u2019s largest economy, before America surpassed it. By the end of 2014 China is on track to reclaim its crown..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A hugely busy day lies ahead -- starting with the news overnight that China's economy is larger than previously thought, and poised to overtake the US as the world's largest economy this year. The International Comparison Program (ICP), conducted with the World Bank, has updated its estimates of the purchasing power of money in countries across the globe (a hefty task). These new purchasing-power parity figures show that America's dominance as the world's most powerful economy since the late 19th Century is almost over. It's the first time since 2005 that the World Bank has updated its estimate of the real living costs around the world -- which show economic strength without the confusion caused by market exchange rates. Today's new figures paint an interesting new picture of the world economy - including the news that China's PPP is actually 20% higher than earlier thought. That means it was 87% the size of America's economy in 2011 -- and given its strong growth since, China is on track to overtake the US this year. The new figures also show that India has overtaken Japan to become the world's third largest economy: As the ICP explains: \"The United States remained the world's largest economy, but it was closely followed by China when measured using PPPs. India was now the world's third largest economy, moving ahead of Japan,\" the report said. \"The results indicate that only a small number of economies have the greatest shares of world GDP. However, the shares of large economies such as China and India have more than doubled relative to that of the United States.\" The PPP measure isn't a perfect measure of economic power. For example, it doesn't consider the size of each country's population -- on a per capita basis, China languishes down the ranks. And in US dollar terms, America's economy is still the largest by some distance. But still, it's a fascinating new insight into the state of the global economy -- which could make people reassess the state of global inequality as well. As the FT's Chris Giles writes: The findings will intensify arguments about control over global international organisations such as the World Bank and IMF, which are increasingly out of line with the balance of global economic power. When looking at the actual consumption per head, the report found the new methodology as well as faster growth in poor countries have \u201cgreatly reduced\u201d the gap between rich and poor, \u201csuggesting that the world has become more equal\u201d. But still -- the world\u2019s rich countries account for 50% of global GDP, while containing only 17% of the world\u2019s population. Reaction to follow. Loads of other stuff afoot too today -- including the latest GDP figures from America (1.30pm BST) and Spain (just out! - +0.4% in Q1), the official report into the failings at the Co-op Bank, and new inflation data from the eurozone (10am BST). There's also financial results from a swath of companies -- including Shell, Next, and Standard Life.Better crack on...",

That is why it is particularly disturbing to hear Japanese and Chinese officials and analysts compare the countries' bilateral relationship to that between Britain and Germany on the eve of the first world war.</p> <p>The disputes between China and several of its neighbours over disputed islands and maritime claims (starting with the conflict with Japan) are just the tip of the iceberg.

This implies the need to develop a blue-water navy to ensure that China's economy cannot be strangled by a maritime blockade.</p> <p>But what China considers a defensive imperative could be perceived as aggressive and expansionist by its neighbours and the United States. And what looks like a defensive imperative to the US and its Asian allies \u2013 building further military capacity in the region to manage China's rise \u2013 could be perceived by China as an aggressive attempt to contain it.</p> <p>Historically, whenever a new great power has emerged and faced an existing power, military conflict has ensued. The inability to accommodate Germany's rise led to two world wars in the 20th century; Japan's confrontation with another Pacific power \u2013 the US \u2013 brought the second world war to Asia.</p> <p>Of course, there are no iron laws of history: China and its interlocutors are not fated to repeat the past. Trade, investment, and diplomacy may defuse rising tensions. But will they?</p> <p>Europe's great powers finally tired of slaughtering one another. Facing a shared threat from the Soviet bloc and US prodding, European countries created institutions to promote peace and co-operation, leading to economic and monetary union, now a banking union, and possibly in the future a fiscal and political union.</p> <p>But no such institutions exist in Asia, where long-standing historical grievances among China, Japan, Korea, India, and other countries remain open wounds. Even two of America's most important allies \u2013 Japan and South Korea \u2013 find themselves in a bitter dispute about the Korean \"comfort women\" forced to work in Japanese military brothels before and during the second world war, despite an official apology from Japan 20 years ago.</p> <p>Why are such tensions among Asia's great powers becoming more serious, and why now?</p> <p>For starters, Asia's powers have recently elected or are poised to elect leaders who are more nationalistic than their predecessors. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, Chinese president, Xi Jinping, South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, and Narendra Modi, who is likely to be India's next prime minister, all fall into this category.</p> <p>Second, all of these leaders now face massive challenges stemming from the need for structural reforms to sustain satisfactory growth rates in the face of global economic forces that are disrupting old models. Different types of structural reforms are crucially important in China, Japan, India, Korea, and Indonesia. If leaders in one or more of these countries were to fail on the economic front, they could feel politically constrained to shift the blame on to foreign \"enemies\".</p> <p>Third, many US allies in Asia (and elsewhere) are wondering whether America's recent strategic \"pivot\" to Asia is credible. Given the feeble US response to the crises in Syria, Ukraine, and other geopolitical hot spots, the American security blanket in Asia looks increasingly tattered. China is now testing the credibility of US guarantees, raising the prospect that America's friends and allies \u2013 starting with Japan \u2013 may have to take more of their security needs into their own hands.</p> <p>Finally, unlike Europe, where Germany accepted the blame for the horrors of the second world war and helped to lead a decades-long effort to construct today's European Union, no such historical agreement exists among Asian countries. As a result, chauvinist sentiments have been instilled in generations that are far removed from the horrors of past wars, while institutions capable of fostering economic and political co-operation remain in their infancy.</p> <p>This is a lethal combination of factors that risks eventually leading to military conflict in a key region of the global economy. How can the US credibly pivot to Asia in a way that does not fuel Chinese perceptions of attempted containment or US allies' perceptions of appeasement of China? How can China build a legitimate defensive military capability that a great power needs and deserves without worrying its neighbours and the US that it aims to seize disputed territory and aspires to strategic hegemony in Asia? And how can Asia's other powers trust that the US will support their legitimate security concerns, rather than abandon them to effective Finlandisation under Chinese domination?</p> <p>It will take enormous wisdom on the part of leaders in the region \u2013 and in the US \u2013 to find diplomatic solutions to Asia's multitude of geopolitical and geo-economic tensions. In the absence of supporting regional institutions, there is little else to ensure that the desire for peace and prosperity prevails over conditions and incentives that tend toward conflict and war.</p> <p>\u2022 Nouriel Roubini is chairman of Roubini Global Economics and professor of economics at New York University's Stern School of Business.</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"www.project-syndicate.org\" title=\"\">Project Syndicat</a>e, 2014.</p>",

Facing a shared threat from the Soviet bloc and US prodding, European countries created institutions to promote peace and co-operation, leading to economic and monetary union, now a banking union, and possibly in the future a fiscal and political union. But no such institutions exist in Asia, where long-standing historical grievances among China, Japan, Korea, India, and other countries remain open wounds. Even two of America's most important allies \u2013 Japan and South Korea \u2013 find themselves in a bitter dispute about the Korean \"comfort women\" forced to work in Japanese military brothels before and during the second world war, despite an official apology from Japan 20 years ago. Why are such tensions among Asia's great powers becoming more serious, and why now? For starters, Asia's powers have recently elected or are poised to elect leaders who are more nationalistic than their predecessors. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, Chinese president, Xi Jinping, South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, and Narendra Modi, who is likely to be India's next prime minister, all fall into this category. Second, all of these leaders now face massive challenges stemming from the need for structural reforms to sustain satisfactory growth rates in the face of global economic forces that are disrupting old models. Different types of structural reforms are crucially important in China, Japan, India, Korea, and Indonesia. If leaders in one or more of these countries were to fail on the economic front, they could feel politically constrained to shift the blame on to foreign \"enemies\". Third, many US allies in Asia (and elsewhere) are wondering whether America's recent strategic \"pivot\" to Asia is credible. Given the feeble US response to the crises in Syria, Ukraine, and other geopolitical hot spots, the American security blanket in Asia looks increasingly tattered. China is now testing the credibility of US guarantees, raising the prospect that America's friends and allies \u2013 starting with Japan \u2013 may have to take more of their security needs into their own hands. Finally, unlike Europe, where Germany accepted the blame for the horrors of the second world war and helped to lead a decades-long effort to construct today's European Union, no such historical agreement exists among Asian countries. As a result, chauvinist sentiments have been instilled in generations that are far removed from the horrors of past wars, while institutions capable of fostering economic and political co-operation remain in their infancy. This is a lethal combination of factors that risks eventually leading to military conflict in a key region of the global economy. How can the US credibly pivot to Asia in a way that does not fuel Chinese perceptions of attempted containment or US allies' perceptions of appeasement of China? How can China build a legitimate defensive military capability that a great power needs and deserves without worrying its neighbours and the US that it aims to seize disputed territory and aspires to strategic hegemony in Asia? And how can Asia's other powers trust that the US will support their legitimate security concerns, rather than abandon them to effective Finlandisation under Chinese domination? It will take enormous wisdom on the part of leaders in the region \u2013 and in the US \u2013 to find diplomatic solutions to Asia's multitude of geopolitical and geo-economic tensions. In the absence of supporting regional institutions, there is little else to ensure that the desire for peace and prosperity prevails over conditions and incentives that tend toward conflict and war. \u2022 Nouriel Roubini is chairman of Roubini Global Economics and professor of economics at New York University's Stern School of Business.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US economic recovery slowed to a crawl in the first quarter of 2014 as a frigid winter appeared to have taken its toll on business. But on the same day the news of the dismal growth was released, the Federal Reserve cut its economic stimulus programme, saying the recovery was now back on track. The Commerce Department announced Wednesday that gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of the value of goods and services, increased by a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 0.1% in the first quarter. Economists had been expecting growth of closer to 1%. The figures represent the Commerce Department\u2019s first take on GDP for the three months from January to March and will be revised as more information becomes available. They come as the Federal Reserve ended its two-day meeting and announced another $10bn cut to its massive bond-buying economic stimulus programme, known as quantitative easing. The Fed will now spend a total of $45bn a month buying bonds in an effort to keep interest rates low and stimulate investment, down from a peak of $85bn each month. The Fed said information it had received since its last meeting in March indicated that growth in economic activity had picked up recently after slowing \u201csharply during the winter in part because of adverse weather conditions.\u201d While the labor market indicators are still mixed and unemployment remains high, the Fed said there were further signs of recovery, and that household spending appeared to be rising more quickly. US stock markets barely moved on the news, but Republican politicians attacked the White House over the slow pace of growth. House speaker John Boehner called the number \u201cpitiful\u201d and claimed Democrats\u2019 attempts to raise the minimum wage would wipe out another 500,000 jobs. Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at broker BTIG, said the GDP figure was \u201cnot just worse than expected, it\u2019s obviously terrible, but as we all know, it\u2019s largely the weather. Importantly, consumer spending was fairly robust even as, expectedly, business spending was terrible and exports were even worse; the later subtracted almost a full percentage point from growth.\u201d Greenhaus pointed to the latest job survey released by ADP, the country\u2019s largest payroll supplier, on Wednesday. According to ADP the US economy added 220,000 jobs in the private sector in April. ADP also revised March\u2019s figure to 200,000, the first time since the end of 2012 that the company has recorded two consecutive months of job gains above 200,000. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, which helps compile the ADP report, said: \"The job market is gaining strength. After a tough winter employers are expanding payrolls across nearly all industries and company sizes. The recent pickup in job growth at mid-sized companies may signal better business confidence. Job market prospects are steadily improving.\u201d ADP\u2019s results come ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll report, the US government\u2019s official tally of job gains. Economists forecast the bureau of labour statistics will report a gain of 215,000 in April, up from the 192,000 jobs added in March. Capital Economics\u2019 chief US economist Paul Ashworth had been expecting GDP growth of around 1.2%. He said the gap between the forecasts and the surprisingly weak figure was principally due to the impact of the winter\u2019s severe weather, an unexpected 5.5% decline in investment in equipment and the complete absence of any rebound in government spending after the federal shutdown in the fourth quarter of last year. \u201cAs the weather has returned to seasonal norms, we have already seen a marked improvement in the monthly data for March, which suggests that there will be a big rebound in second-quarter GDP growth,\u201d he said. The marked slowdown in the economy at the start of the year follows a pick-up in GDP during much of 2013. In the second half of last year, the economy expanded by 3.4%. The Commerce Department report offers more evidence of how the bitterly cold winter hit the economy. With temperatures in some states at 30-year lows and snows reaching as far south as Atlanta, Georgia, consumers cut back. According to the Commerce Department, consumer spending on goods rose a mere 0.4% during the quarter. Households spent more on services \u2013 including energy to heat their homes and healthcare, the latter of which may have been boosted by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 causing total consumer consumption to rise 3.0%. Businesses cut back in the first quarter, with spending on building, equipment and intellectual property down 2.1% compared to a 5.7% gain in the previous period. Exports fell 7.6% in the first quarter, the largest drop since the recession ended, as economic woes surfaced again in Europe and Asia.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A century of American economy is about to come to an end. China is on the point of overtaking the US as the world's biggest economy. If Washington called the shots in the 20th Century, Beijing will be doing the same in the 21st. These are the bald conclusions from reports showing that China is hard on the heels of the US in terms of its share of global GDP and that it won't be long \u2013 given current trends in growth rates - before the positions at the top are reversed. Not so fast, though. China, by virtue of its population, was the world's biggest economy at the dawn of the industrial revolution but lagged behind as countries in Europe and North America industrialised rapidly. As soon as China started its period of catch-up at the end of the 1970s, it was only a matter of time before its sheer size would make it number one. What has been surprising is the speed at which that transformation has taken place, with the date at which the US loses its top dog status constantly brought forward. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, estimates that the big moment will arrive in 2020; the latest data suggests it could be as soon as this year. There are two other points to bear in mind. The first is that the calculations rely on using purchasing power parity to assess the comparative size of economies. This allows for the fact that prices tend to be a lot lower in poor countries than they are in rich countries, so incomes stretch further. But the PPP measure can never be 100% reliable given the problems of comparing prices across the world, so it is impossible to be precise about when China will actually become the world's biggest economy. The second \u2013 more significant \u2013 point is that even with the use of the PPP method, real living standards in China remain well behind those in the US. Per capita incomes in China, according to the OECD, are 75% of the global average, whilst those in the US are 370%. China's sheer size and its rapid growth rate mean that it is now a global force to be reckoned with when it comes to talks about economic management, trade and climate change. But on the measure that really matters to people \u2013 living standards \u2013 it remains a poor country.",

      "body": "<p>A century of American economy is about to come to an end. China is on the point of overtaking the US as the world's biggest economy. If Washington called the shots in the 20th Century, Beijing will be doing the same in the 21st.</p> <p>These are the bald conclusions from reports showing that China is hard on the heels of the US in terms of its share of global GDP and that it won't be long \u2013 given current trends in growth rates - before the positions at the top are reversed.</p> <p>Not so fast, though. China, by virtue of its population, was the world's biggest economy at the dawn of the industrial revolution but lagged behind as countries in Europe and North America industrialised rapidly. As soon as China started its period of catch-up at the end of the 1970s, it was only a matter of time before its sheer size would make it number one. What has been surprising is the speed at which that transformation has taken place, with the date at which the US loses its top dog status constantly brought forward.</p> <p>John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, estimates that the big moment will arrive in 2020; the latest data suggests it could be as soon as this year.</p> <p>There are two other points to bear in mind. The first is that the calculations rely on using purchasing power parity to assess the comparative size of economies. This allows for the fact that prices tend to be a lot lower in poor countries than they are in rich countries, so incomes stretch further. But the PPP measure can never be 100% reliable given the problems of comparing prices across the world, so it is impossible to be precise about when China will actually become the world's biggest economy.</p> <p>The second \u2013 more significant \u2013 point is that even with the use of the PPP method, real living standards in China remain well behind those in the US. Per capita incomes in China, according to the OECD, are 75% of the global average, whilst those in the US are 370%. China's sheer size and its rapid growth rate mean that it is now a global force to be reckoned with when it comes to talks about economic management, trade and climate change. But on the measure that really matters to people \u2013 living standards \u2013 it remains a poor country.</p>",

Fresh research by the International Comparison Program (ICP), coordinated by the World Bank, considered the real cost of living and purchasing power in countries around the world as the best way of comparing the size of different economies. Using this measure, the ICP concluded that the size of the Chinese economy in 2011 was 87% of the US economy, up from 43% in 2005 when the last comparison was made. \"The United States remained the world's largest economy, but it was closely followed by China when measured using purchasing power parity,\" the ICP said in its report.

      "bodyText": "Europe's highest court dealt a blow to George Osborne's attempts to defend the interests of the City when it threw out Britain's legal challenge to a tax on financial transactions. The European court of justice said the UK could not block attempts by 11 countries to use a financial transaction tax because it was not yet in operation. The Treasury insisted that it would still be possible to challenge the levy if and when it was introduced and that it had been vital to put down a marker before plans for the FTT were finalised. But the UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the decision showed that the government was impotent to protect the country's biggest industry from outside interference. \"The court dismisses the United Kingdom's action,\" the ECJ said in a statement. \" ... the contested decision does no more than authorise the establishment of enhanced cooperation, but does not contain any substantive element on the FTT itself.\" David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, which supports an FTT for the UK said: \"George Osborne has gone to Europe to bat for the bankers, but he's been bowled first ball. \"This futile legal challenge tells you all you need to know about the government's misguided priorities: it would rather defend a privileged elite in the City than support a tax that could raise billions to tackle poverty and protect public services. \"Instead of trying to stop other countries taxing their financial sectors, our government should follow their lead, stand up to vested interests and harness the City's excessive wealth for the wider benefit of society. \"Complaining that the City will be hit by a European FTT is a clear case of double standards - almost half of the \u00a33bn revenue from our own FTT, the stamp duty on shares, comes from non-UK residents.\" Farage said: \"This FTT judgement shows that the UK cannot act to protect the UK's biggest interest. It is impotent and at the mercy of an antagonistic federalist court \u2013 the ECJ. \"It shows Cameron's argument that the UK government can negotiate a better deal for British business from within the EU as a fraud and a farce. The only way to protect the UK financial interest is to withdraw from the tax-hungry EU and stop giving Brussels power over us.\" Osborne has insisted that this bank levy and tougher supervision of the City is the way to respond to the financial crisis of 2008-09. The Treasury lodged a challenge to the FTT when it became clear that a number of EU countries, including Germany and France, were determined to press ahead with the idea, first floated by the US economist James Tobin, to levy a small tax on financial transactions such as foreign exchange and derivatives trades. A Treasury spokesperson said: \"Today's decision confirms the UK will be able to challenge the final proposal for a financial transaction tax if it is not in our national interest and undermines the integrity of the single market. We risked not being able to do that if we had not made this challenge now. \"The government is determined to continue to ensure that the interests of countries outside of the single currency but inside the single market are properly protected as the euro area continues to integrate, including with any proposal for a financial transactions tax.\" Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: \"George Osborne is forcing austerity on the British people so his friends in the City don't have to clean up the financial wreckage they caused. \"It's no surprise that the government has confirmed that it will challenge the European court of justice's decision just as the government is opposing the EU cap on bankers' bonuses in the courts. \"It's clear proof that this government will back spivs and speculators at the expense of our schools and hospitals. What should make the people of our country really angry is that this government will use our taxes to support legal challenges on behalf of the very people who wrecked our economy.\" Katja Hall, CBI chief policy director, said: \"This decision about legal procedure doesn't change the fact that the financial transactions tax will damage growth, jobs and investment across Europe. \"It will have a far-reaching impact on non-participating member states, by including extra-territorial reach into financial services activity conducted in the UK. \"As the UK's largest single trading partner, a healthy European economy is in everyone's interests so we urge that this damaging tax is re-considered.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Next has raised its expectations for this year's profits for the second time since March after beating sales forecasts. Sales in the first 13 weeks of Next's financial year rose 10.8% \u2013 well above the 8.5% growth expected by the City. High street sales were up 8.8%, while online and catalogue sales advanced 13.7%. This means sales are ahead of the 4%-8% full-year guidance the company gave in March, prompting it to raise it again to 5.5%-9.5%. Next has credited being \"braver in buying into new trends\" for the sales growth, as well as a more benign consumer environment, after wage growth finally caught up with inflation. Lord Wolfson, the chief executive, said the first quarter was much stronger than expected because of the later Easter and warmer weather than a year ago. \"The run rate is well ahead of what we are expecting for the rest of the year,\" he added. \"In general, the economy feels more benign.\" But the flipside is that \"the faster the economy recovers, the sooner interest rates will go up\", he said, pointing to high house price growth. \"That will slow sales.\" The retailer said the better sales performance would increase annual profits to \u00a3750m-790m, \u00a320m more than previous estimates. Last year, Next made profits of \u00a3695m. Next is moving ahead of its bigger rival Marks &amp; Spencer, which is expected to report its third year of falling profits later this month. Analysts reckon M&amp;S made \u00a3615m-620m, a far cry from the \u00a31bn reported in 2008. It will be the first time Next's profits have exceeded those of M&amp;S. Marks &amp; Spencer has also fallen behind John Lewis. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \"At the upper end of the range, profits growth would be 14% and it would be a brave man who looked for anything less than the top of the range, given Next's record.\" The company said it would pay a third special dividend of 50p a share on 1 August. Next is scrapping its share matching plan \u2013 an executive bonus scheme \u2013 this year because some shareholders prefer long-term incentive plans, Wolfson said. He shared his \u00a34m bonus from the plan \u2013 one of three bonuses he received \u2013 for the second year running among the retailer's staff, resulting in a 1.5% pay rise for them. They will see their hourly pay go up by 37p to \u00a36.70 from 1 June, above the national minium minimum wage, which will go up to \u00a36.50 in October. But unions representing shopfloor staff argue that while the increase is welcome, it still leaves staff wages well below the living wage of \u00a37.65 an hour, or \u00a38.80 in London. Wolfson noted that Next has more than 30 applicants for every job vacancy across the country, and argued that the living wage is a somewhat arbitrary concept, as \"it does depend very much on your circumstances\". He warned that raising the national minimum wage \"would destroy a large number of jobs\". He believes it is already too high in some parts of the country and \"prevents them from competing\". In any case, he said most retailers already pay more in central London, where the cost of living is higher than elsewhere.",

High street sales were up 8.8%, while online and catalogue sales advanced 13.7%. This means sales are ahead of the 4%-8% full-year guidance the company gave in March, prompting it to raise it again to 5.5%-9.5%.</p> <p>Next has credited being \"braver in buying into new trends\" for the sales growth, as well as a more benign consumer environment, after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/12/wage-rises-outpaced-inflation-official-data\" title=\"\">wage growth finally caught up with inflation</a>.</p> <p>Lord Wolfson, the chief executive, said the first quarter was much stronger than expected because of the later Easter and warmer weather than a year ago. \"The run rate is well ahead of what we are expecting for the rest of the year,\" he added. \"In general, the economy feels more benign.\"</p> <p>But the flipside is that \"the faster the economy recovers, the sooner interest rates will go up\", he said, pointing to high house price growth. \"That will slow sales.\"</p> <p>The retailer said the better sales performance would increase annual profits to \u00a3750m-790m, \u00a320m more than previous estimates. Last year, Next made profits of \u00a3695m. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2014/mar/20/how-has-next-outperformed-marks-and-spencer\" title=\"\">Next is moving ahead of its bigger rival Marks &amp; Spencer</a>, which is expected to report its third year of falling profits later this month. Analysts reckon M&amp;S made \u00a3615m-620m, a far cry from the \u00a31bn reported in 2008. It will be the first time Next's profits have exceeded those of M&amp;S. Marks &amp; Spencer has also fallen behind John Lewis.</p> <p>Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \"At the upper end of the range, profits growth would be 14% and it would be a brave man who looked for anything less than the top of the range, given Next's record.\"</p> <p>The company said it would pay a third special dividend of 50p a share on 1 August.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/11/next-chief-executive-lord-wolfson-bonus\" title=\"\">Next is scrapping its share matching plan</a> \u2013 an executive bonus scheme \u2013 this year because some shareholders prefer long-term incentive plans, Wolfson said. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/09/next-boss-share-4m-bonus-with-staff-payrise\" title=\"\">He shared his \u00a34m bonus from the plan \u2013 one of three bonuses he received \u2013 for the second year running</a> among the retailer's staff, resulting in a 1.5% pay rise for them. They will see their hourly pay go up by 37p to \u00a36.70 from 1 June, above the national minium minimum wage, which will go up to \u00a36.50 in October. But unions representing shopfloor staff argue that while the increase is welcome, it still leaves staff wages well below the living wage of \u00a37.65 an hour, or \u00a38.80 in London.</p> <p>Wolfson noted that Next has more than 30 applicants for every job vacancy across the country, and argued that the living wage is a somewhat arbitrary concept, as \"it does depend very much on your circumstances\". He warned that raising the national minimum wage \"would destroy a large number of jobs\". He believes it is already too high in some parts of the country and \"prevents them from competing\". In any case, he said most retailers already pay more in central London, where the cost of living is higher than elsewhere.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Standard Life has reported a 50% slump in annuity sales after the chancellor's budget reforms scrapped compulsory annuities. George Osborne took the insurance industry by surprise when he announced in his March budget that pensioners would no longer be forced to use their savings pots to buy an annuity (an annual income). The change takes effect next April. Standard Life's chief executive, David Nish, said people with pension pots worth less than \u00a310,000 were withdrawing their money, while those with larger pension pots are deferring the decision. He said: \"While it will be some time before long-term trends become clear, the negative profit impact of the changes will reflect the relatively small size of our annuity business.\" Annuities contributed 6%, or \u00a345m, to overall operating profits of \u00a3750m last year. Nish added: \"The changes are very important and in many ways very positive for customers.\" But he criticised the way they were announced, which he said gave customers the sense that annuities were not worth having. The pensions minister, Steve Webb, said at the time that affluent people should be free to blow their pension pot on a Lamborghini even if this meant they ended up relying on the state pension. PricewaterhouseCoopers predicted in a report earlier this month that sales of annuities will collapse by 75%, from \u00a312bn to \u00a33bn, after conducting research among consumers aged 50 to 75. It found that three-quarters will not buy an annuity. Nearly 400,000 pension savers reach retirement every year, with pension pots averaging \u00a330,000. Evidence from other countries where annuities are not mandatory also makes grim reading for the UK's \u00a314bn annuities business. Only one in 25 Australians buys an annuity. In the US, most people also take their pensions as cash. Marcus Barnard, an analyst with Oriel Securities, said: \"Standard Life has positioned itself to meet the long-term savings needs of its retail workplace, institutional and wholesale clients. It is not the largest annuity writer, but this line of business has helped its embedded value profitability.\" Prudential, Legal &amp; General and Aviva are more heavily involved in annuities. L&amp;G has said the budget changes would reduce annuity sales across the industry to \u00a34.4bn a year. Standard Life said it had made a good start to 2014, with assets under administration up 1.5% to \u00a3247.8bn. Fee revenues have climbed 12% to \u00a3374m. The Edinburgh-based company said its position on Scottish independence had not changed since February, when it revealed that it had drawn up contingency plans to quit Scotland if it becomes an independent country. Nish said there was a \"strong level of understanding\" from customers. \"We have not seen significant outflows from our business ... In the main the reaction has been that we did the right thing.\" Standard Life said in February it was very proud of its Scottish heritage \u2013 it has been based in Scotland for 189 years \u2013 but would \"take whatever action we consider necessary\" to protect its business, including transferring parts of its operations from Scotland.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Christopher Kelly's report into how the Co-operative Bank was left with a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall last May contains a number of anecdotes, but one which he picks out relates to the way the accounts were drawn up for the 2011 financial year. He appears to be illustrating that bonuses mattered, even at the ethically motivated, mutually owned bank. Kelly points out that the additional provision would have had the effect of nearly halving the bank's \u00a340m bonus pool for its employees and directors. \"In February 2012, on a Friday afternoon, prior to the bank publishing its 2011 annual report and accounts, the bank finance team, risk team and CFO agreed that an additional \u00a320m [of provisions for bad loans] should be charged against the corporate portfolio,\" Kelly writes. So, the finance team worked over the weekend to update the draft, only for the extra \u00a320m provision to be reversed on the Monday morning. \"The reversal was thought by some of those involved to have followed a conversation between the bank CEO and the group CEO. But there is no direct evidence of this,\" Kelly's report said. The bank's acting chief executive at the time, Barry Tootell, apparently ordered the reversal although he has no recollection of these events. The group chief executive, Peter Marks, denies any conversation took place. Before approving the annual report and accounts the audit committee was not told of this change and the auditor concluded that although the level of provisions was acceptable, the initial provision was towards the \"more optimistic end\" of the acceptable range. Does it matter? The finance team who worked over the weekend \"were aware\" of the effect that the \u00a320m provision would have on the bonus pool, Kelly concludes.",
