    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s perhaps a weekend chore strictly for masochists, but more Britons than ever before are digging out their Allen keys and inner resolve to tackle Billy bookcases and Pax wardrobes. Last year Ikea rang up record UK sales as a generation of renters and space-starved families deepened the nation\u2019s love-hate relationship with its flatpack furniture. Sales at the Swedish retailer\u2019s UK stores jumped more than 11% to \u00a31.4bn in the year to 31 August as a reinvigorated housing market and demand for space-saving designs boosted trade. The retailer\u2019s decision to embrace the internet also means shoppers who can\u2019t face trekking round its vast blue and yellow sheds can buy online. Internet sales were up nearly 27%. \u201cWe ride the wave of the housing market,\u201d says UK country retail manager Gillian Drakeford. \u201cWe also know not everybody can afford to move because prices are high but just because you live in a rental property doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t improve the way you live.\u201d There can be a fine line between pleasure and pain and for many a shopping trip to Ikea tests the boundary: the pleasure of buying a Billy for \u00a320 can be cancelled out by long queues at the checkouts and the hassle of shoehorning the box into your car \u2013 and that\u2019s before you even look at the instructions. But Drakeford insists Ikea\u2019s success in Britain is not down to the website offering shoppers a get out of jail free card. \u201cAlthough online is growing what is really encouraging is the growth in the stores,\u201d she says, pointing to a 5% increase in shopper numbers. \u201cAll our stores are showing growth, and that is for the third year in a row.\u201d For many years Ikea was an internet denier sticking to the no-frills cash-and-carry philosophy it argued was necessary to underpin its low prices. But as rivals adopted the \u201cpick and click\u201d model favoured by shoppers, Ikea was forced to follow suit. It launched online in 2007 in the UK and now the lion\u2019s share of its products is available on its website, which accounts for 10% of its trade. \u201cCustomers are visiting the store and using the layouts to get ideas but perhaps going home and placing the order online,\u201d says Drakeford. \u201cIngvar [Kamprad, the company\u2019s octogenarian founder] and the family see this very much as the future. \u201cGetting a Pax wardrobe home is not the easiest thing to do,\u201d she concedes, with a third of its shoppers now opting for home delivery. \u201cWe are demonstrating to the wider Ikea group that going online is not killing the stores \u2013 it makes us more accessible, which grows the brand.\u201d Drakeford, 50, was part of the management team that opened the Swedish group\u2019s first UK store in Warrington in the late 1980s. Last year she was recalled to Britain after more than a decade running its fledgling business in China. Very much on-message, she confesses to having spent the previous weekend assembling some Ikea furniture for the west London family home: \u201cI built a small chest of drawers and a mirror. It didn\u2019t take an awful lot of time.\u201d The British market presents the Ikea veteran, who was born in the Lake District and grew up in the northwest, with a different kind of leadership challenge. After three UK bosses in six years, she insists she is committed to a long stint. \u201cStability in senior leadership enables you to set a medium-to-long-term direction,\u201d she says. Last year she set the goal of doubling UK turnover and market share by 2020. \u201cIt was very much a case of looking at the brand and thinking what will it take to grow? One of the challenges we\u2019ve had is the shopping experience has not always been at its best.\u201d In the past Ikea has been accused of reserving top management jobs for Swedes \u2013 and men \u2013 but Drakeford, who does not speak Swedish, is adamant there is no glass ceiling. \u201cAs a woman who\u2019s grown up in Ikea I have never felt that to be an issue,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m also a working mum \u2013 I have three kids \u2013 with our Scandinavian roots I think we come from a point of equality.\u201d Gripes about bad service and maze-like stores have not prevented Ikea rising to become the UK\u2019s biggest furniture retailer and during the 2014 financial year Drakeford made progress towards her goal, with market-share increasing by 0.5% points to 7.1%. Its success is impressive given that its desire to open only large stores means it still has just 18 branches \u2013 although it has acquired sites in Reading, London\u2019s Greenwich, Exeter and Sheffield. Drakeford declines to say how profits fared, deferring to the group\u2019s financial report due out in January. \u201cWe see profit as a resource to reinvest,\u201d she says, promising \u00a327m will be ploughed into lowering prices in the UK in the coming year. To win back shoppers Ikea has been overhauling the way it presents its room sets to better represent lifestyle trends, gleaned from studying the homes of 250 British families. \u201cWe know some families are expanding but not able to move, so the child has to take some space in the adults\u2019 bedroom,\u201d says Drakeford. \u201cSo we try and show a creative way to share the same space.\u201d Another rich sales seam is the booming rental market as property prices in the south-east in particular put home ownership out of reach for many. A third of private tenants move each year and Ikea reports demand for freestanding furniture and space-saving gadgets such as its R\u00e5grund chair-cum-towel-rack. \u201cPeople don\u2019t necessarily want to fix everything to a wall,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are telling us \u2018just because I live in a small space or rent doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to have a really nice home\u2019.\u201d So how has Ikea changed since Drakeford donned a red sweatshirt on a cold October morning in Warrington back in 1987? \u201cWhen I was here the first time round Ikea was very unique and had a huge impact on the way people thought about their homes,\u201d she says. \u201cComing back I have to accept that we haven\u2019t always been on the side of our customers. Today shoppers are telling us our stores are much better; they are less crowded and availability is better. The biggest challenge is persuading customers who have decided not to shop with Ikea to return.\u201d",

Drakeford declines to say how profits fared, deferring to the group\u2019s financial report due out in January. \u201cWe see profit as a resource to reinvest,\u201d she says, promising \u00a327m will be ploughed into lowering prices in the UK in the coming year.</p> <p>To win back shoppers Ikea has been overhauling the way it presents its room sets to better represent lifestyle trends, gleaned from studying the homes of 250 British families. \u201cWe know some families are expanding but not able to move, so the child has to take some space in the adults\u2019 bedroom,\u201d says Drakeford. \u201cSo we try and show a creative way to share the same space.\u201d</p> <p>Another rich sales seam is the booming rental market as property prices in the south-east in particular put home ownership out of reach for many. A third of private tenants move each year and Ikea reports demand for freestanding furniture and space-saving gadgets such as its <a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/90253074/\" title=\"\">R\u00e5grund chair-cum-towel-rack</a>. \u201cPeople don\u2019t necessarily want to fix everything to a wall,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are telling us \u2018just because I live in a small space or rent doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to have a really nice home\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>So how has Ikea changed since Drakeford donned a red sweatshirt on a cold October morning in Warrington back in 1987? \u201cWhen I was here the first time round Ikea was very unique and had a huge impact on the way people thought about their homes,\u201d she says. \u201cComing back I have to accept that we haven\u2019t always been on the side of our customers. Today shoppers are telling us our stores are much better; they are less crowded and availability is better. The biggest challenge is persuading customers who have decided not to shop with Ikea to return.\u201d</p>",
