      "bodyText": "As is said of the Gallipoli campaign of the first world war, the only real strategic success of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership was achieved in the way he left it. His tactical move to force the Dutton camp to produce the petition with 43 signatures for a party-room meeting bought the anti-Dutton forces time to get behind Scott Morrison. It meant that Turnbull\u2019s successor would in some small way be of his choosing (even if that choice was forced upon him) and it brought the added bonus of allowing the nation to dodge a very big bullet. But where are we now? It is true that Morrison essentially has no blood on his hands, but that only really matters when you spend your days glued to Sky News and ABC24 following the minutiae. For most voters, forced to turn their eyes with annoyance towards political machinations, the overwhelming response will be one of, \u201cwhat the hell just happened, and why?\u201d At no point did Peter Dutton, Julie Bishop or Morrison really explain why they were running for the leadership. Neither did the triumvirate of Mathias Cormann, Michaelia Cash and Mitch Fifield make clear why they no longer supported Turnbull. They said they were resigning because Turnbull no longer had the support of the party room, which the spill results showed was a fib \u2013 with their support, Turnbull would have retained a majority. Thus we have a new prime minister and no one could really tell you why, other than that the festering ideological stupidity that consumes the conservative elements of the party had burst to the surface. The trigger for all of this was essentially the national energy guarantee. Wading into climate change is always treacherous for any conservative leader given the party remains filled with those who see it as a great leftwing hoax. There\u2019s not much you can do to negotiate with people so divorced from reason and logic, but Turnbull did the worst possible thing and caved. He and then environment minister Josh Frydenberg on Monday announced that they were completely gutting the Neg. And standing next to them both was also then treasurer, Scott Morrison. The reworked version of the Neg was so utterly stripped of anything to do with emissions targeting that it immediately rendered Turnbull devoid of purpose. He was clearly Liberal party leader in name only. In conceding to the climate-change deniers in the party, he effectively handed them the knife with which to end his political career. But there was more to come. He then capitulated on company tax cuts. By this stage, so loud was news about leadership challenges that this barely made a ripple in the news cycle, and yet in many ways it was a bigger collapse to the populists in the party. This was the key signature economic policy of his government. Unlike the income tax cuts, which have actually passed into law, the company tax cuts were taken to the election. And yet, after years of telling voters that they were essential, Turnbull told the media that they needed to be dumped because, of all things, a lack of consensus. It was an acquiescence to the same group of conservatives opposed to the Neg, and seemed to declare that his leadership of the Liberal party was void, and his prime ministership without purpose. Effectively, he was saying that despite his belief that lowering company tax cuts was vital for the economy, would bring greater prosperity, higher wages, and was needed given the changing international context, he would be not willing to argue this to voters. At that point, it was pretty difficult to point to anything Turnbull stood for. And yet here we are: the company tax cuts were marshalled by Morrison, who is now the prime minister, and the national energy guarantee was pushed by Frydenberg, who is now the deputy of the Liberal party and treasurer. Try explaining that to voters. It is the most abject failure of a leadership challenge in Australian political history. Peter Dutton and Tony Abbott have engineered the end of Malcolm Turnbull only to simultaneously achieve their own humiliation. So where to now? On one level, there is unlikely to be much change. No one is more closely linked to Turnbull than Morrison. As treasurer he has claim over all the economic policy of this government. On the one hand that is fine, he will just keep rolling out the talk about employment growth and lower unemployment. But it still means he has to explain why he, and not Turnbull, is in the job and he will likely wish to differentiate himself from his predecessor with some new policies. Morrison has appeared in parliament holding a lump of coal, so no one should be expecting any increased intelligence from the Liberal party on climate change, and so presumably the latest bastardised version of the national energy guarantee will remain. But Morrison is saddled with the problem of weak wages growth. As was the case when he was treasurer, his job will be to explain to voters why they should stick with his economic policies in spite of falling real household incomes at a time of strong employment growth. So in a sense his job remains the same but the big difference is that he has to explain this to voters who are now wondering: \u201cWait, who are you, and what happened to Malcolm Turnbull?\u201d Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "When Andy Murray returns to Grand Slam tennis at this week\u2019s US Open, he won\u2019t be the only one with big-day nerves, as Amazon looks to ace its first exclusive broadcast of a sports event. Amazon has pulled out all the stops to make its $40m (\u00a334m) bet on the UK rights to the US Open \u2013 setting up a studio at Flushing Meadows and drafting in former players including Jim Courier, Greg Rusedski, Annabel Croft and Mark Petchey, as the company looks to prove it can match traditional broadcasters and become a credible home for live sport. On Monday Amazon will step into the shoes of Sky, which dropped its coverage of the US Open in 2016 after 25 years, well aware of the tarnished reputation of streaming services in the live sport arena. During the World Cup, YouTube proved that even being the world\u2019s largest video-sharing platform does not mean live streaming comes easy, as its $35-a-month subscription service suffered an embarrassing outage during England\u2019s semi-final clash with Croatia. In Australia, streamer Optus, which held exclusive World Cup rights, had to allow public broadcaster SBS to air games after its service failed. In May, Formula One refunded subscribers after its new streaming service ran into trouble during the Spanish Grand Prix. And last month DAZN, the streaming service controlled by Warner Music owner Len Blavatnik, apologised to customers after its first crack at delivering Serie A Italian football coverage failed during the opening game of the season. \u201cAmazon will absolutely want to be seen to be producing to a level consummate to what Sky have historically. They are taking it very seriously as they did for Queen\u2019s [tennis tournament] earlier in the summer,\u201d says Graham Fry, managing director of IMG Productions, which produced Amazon\u2019s coverage of the Wimbledon warm-up event. \u201cThey are putting a lot of resource into it. Streaming services are learning in an environment where people now want instant results. We are entering a phase of change [with streaming companies] happening quicker now than any time in my TV production career.\u201d The UK has become Amazon\u2019s test market for a foray into whether exclusive live sports can supercharge its Prime Video TV offering, and ultimately expand the 100 million-strong customer base who pay \u00a379 a year for its Prime subscription service of perks, from free music streaming to one-day delivery. Alex Green, who heads Amazon Prime Video\u2019s sport push in Europe, says that given the company handled an average per-minute audience of more than 300,000 streams for its Thursday night NFL game broadcasts, it can manage the tennis. \u201cOf course we\u2019re prepared, we\u2019re no stranger to large-scale live events,\u201d says Green, who formerly worked at BT. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest live event we\u2019ve covered in the UK. We\u2019re confident we can service demand.\u201d Facebook has also upped its sports strategy recently, striking deals for La Liga Spanish football broadcast rights across the Indian subcontinent and Champions League matches in South America, and it\u2019s expected to reveal Premier League deals for Thailand and Vietnam in the coming months. Live sport is the major driver of pay-TV subscriptions \u2013 Sky built its business on the Premier League while BT needed sport to successfully break into the TV market \u2013 and Silicon Valley companies snapping up rights threatens pay and free-to-air broadcasters alike. Amazon and arch-rival Netflix offer low-cost TV services, which subscribers mostly choose to bolt on to their main, more expensive pay-TV subscription. But some analysts believe that sport could be a key factor in getting viewers to abandon traditional TV in larger numbers. \u201cSport is the missing ingredient,\u201d says Tim Mulligan, analyst at MIDiA Research. \u201cServices like Amazon and Netflix are seen as additive: they need to be seen as a real substitute for pay-TV. A cornerstone of traditional TV is sport and there is a perception among mainstream TV users that you have to have sport and news. To make the economics work they have to appeal to mainstream consumers in the same ways traditional TV does.\u201d The competition to become a serious live sports broadcasting player is set to intensify next year, following a deal that will see Amazon become the first streaming service to exclusively broadcast Premier League matches. Amazon UK will also become the exclusive home of the men\u2019s ATP tennis World Tour for the next five years, another former Sky property. \u201cWe look at lots of sports opportunities. We\u2019ll keep listening to our customers, trying things and learning,\u201d says Green. \u201cWe are going to produce the best possible coverage of those events, see how our customers react and take it from there.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Long before the era of Ryanair charges, those who flew knew the importance of minimising baggage. According to the French pilot and author Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry: \u201cHe who would travel happily must travel light.\u201d But now, even a case small enough to fit an aircraft\u2019s overhead locker does not guarantee a passenger\u2019s happiness. From November, Ryanair will only permit cases in the cabin for those who pay a \u00a36 priority boarding fee. Other passengers will now have to pay \u00a38 online to check a small wheeled case into the hold. Just one small bag, to fit under the seat in front, will be freely permitted. Coming from an airline that has failed to shake a reputation for giving nothing away, the new rules have provoked angry reaction online and accusations of cynical profiteering. Ryanair, however, insists the aim is to cut delays caused by passengers scrambling to stow luggage, which have kept planes on the tarmac too long for tight airline schedules. While checked-in baggage revenues have been an important stream of income, the Irish airline has already cut the high fees it once espoused. The changes, it says, will not make money: indeed, the new \u00a38 price for a sub-10kg checked-in suitcase may encourage some to pack lighter and avoid fees of \u00a325 or more to put a heavier case in the hold. Aviation experts are inclined to agree. John Strickland says: \u201cIt could be a revenue opportunity \u2013 but Ryanair\u2019s average fare is \u20ac40 [\u00a336] and average ancillary revenue per passenger is \u20ac12. They still have to fill those planes, and to succeed in flying 130 million people a year, they have stick to that mantra of affordable travel, whether it is the ticket price or the add-ons customers are obliged to pay.\u201d Edmond Rose, an aviation consultant whose past jobs include director of revenue at Virgin Atlantic, says: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that when you\u2019re charging for checked baggage it is a money raiser \u2013 because the cost of handling is an awful lot less than the prices airlines charge. \u201cBut Ryanair\u2019s isn\u2019t particularly high, and the fact they\u2019ve limited numbers [of passengers who can book priority seats] does show that the real problem is the overhead bins.\u201d Overhead locker space has failed to match demand. Planes are departing ever fuller, typically now with more than 90% of seats sold on every flight, as the airline industry keeps an even tighter focus on costs. And passengers have adapted their habits to match. They were encouraged to bring bags into the cabin when airlines separated out checked luggage charges in order to advertise rock-bottom headline fares. Budget airlines have spread across the world in a symbiotic relationship with the small wheeled case, whose widespread use is often dated back to the Rollaboard, invented by a pilot in 1987, in a modern aviation culture of short breaks and minimal costs. And passengers have turned the tables on the bean-counters to the point where Ryanair\u2019s finance director last year bemoaned the sight of toddlers with wheelies, the result of passengers who weren\u2019t \u201cplaying by the rules\u201d and \u201ctaking the piss\u201d. However galling that sight may have been, the bigger factor ultimately appears to be the wheelie\u2019s threat to turnaround times of as brief as 25 minutes between flights, which are central to budget airline economics. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of money in it, but punctuality and quick boarding is more important, not having passengers blocking everyone else while they wrestle to make a bit of space in the overhead,\u201d says Rose. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting with cabin baggage is that airlines keep trying different ways to allow it or charge for it \u2013 it keeps swinging around.\u201d The Hungarian airline Wizz initially charged for all cabin bags, before abandoning the policy last year. British Airways and Virgin have marketed some fares for hand-luggage only, rather than appear to charge extra for checking bags, but both have generous carry-on allowances. Ryanair is now abandoning a recent rule change that allowed wheeled cases to be taken at the gate and put in the aircraft hold for free. A spokesman for London Stansted airport, Ryanair\u2019s biggest UK base, said summer shifts on the frontline had shown that something had to change. \u201cThe policy of putting cases in the hold at the boarding gate was a false economy, in terms of the efforts involved at the gate and the impact it was having on flight delays.\u201d The baggage picture is further complicated by Ryanair\u2019s own contracts with airports: it relaxed its more stringent clampdowns on carry-ons in 2013 to get preferential terms at Stansted, promising more passengers shopping in airport shops. Although the airline doesn\u2019t spell it out for passengers, it will still allow those duty-free shopping bags on board as well. Last year, rival easyJet lowered charges significantly for smaller checked-in bags, weighing under 15kg. It also launched a \u201chands free\u201d service, designed to encourage passengers already at the airport to check in small cases, rather than drag them through security and on to the plane, for a \u00a35 fee. From a different angle, with typical controversy, Ryanair may well have ended up in a similar place.",
