      "bodyText": "For one oil industry veteran, the dismantling of the Brent oil field in the North Sea prompts mixed feelings. There is gratitude for the livelihood earned from Britain\u2019s post-war energy boom. And relief that it means farewell to \u201chell on Earth\u201d. \u201cBrent kept me and my family in gainful employment, so I have something to be grateful for, but these platforms are from an era long gone,\u201d says Jake Molloy, 55, who was a production assistant on the Brent Delta platform. Describing the structure, which Shell plans to remove from the North Sea, Molloy adds: \u201cPutting people down platform legs [which store pumps and vessels] is really bad. You could climb down thousands of steps to the bottom with 40 pounds of breathing apparatus on your back only for the alarms to go off and you had to go all the way back again. It was the worst working environment \u2013 horrendous, hell on earth.\u201d Shell\u2019s announcement that it plans to remove the platform was just one of many symbolic retreats staged by the oil industry last week. A day after the Brent proposals, Shell\u2019s rival BP said it was taking a $4.5bn (\u00a33bn) hit in its quarterly accounts to pay for the cost of bringing forward the closure of some unprofitable UK fields, partly due to lower oil prices. Situated 115 miles east of the Shetland Islands, Brent is estimated to have produced 10% of all North Sea oil and gas while generating \u00a320bn of tax revenues since it opened in 1976. Brent is not the first North Sea field to face decommissioning and BP has been planning closures for some time. But the timing makes the closures all the more pointed. Shell\u2019s field gave its name to a benchmark that has plummeted over the past year. The price of a barrel of Brent crude has dived from $115 in June last year to less than $50 last month. The price has bounced back in the past two weeks to $58 but Bob Dudley, the chief executive of BP, warned last week that the industry had to prepare for a \u201cnew phase\u201d of lower prices that could last months, even years. There will be more cost-cutting moves by the global oil industry over the next 12 months. BP is halving its exploration activity, slashing its capital expenditure by 20% and spending $1bn on making staff redundant after recording a $1bn loss in the last quarter. The $4.5bn writedown for its North Sea operations includes \u201cincreases in expected decommissioning costs\u201d \u2013 an accounting footnote viewed by Iain Reid, oil analyst at BMO Capital Markets, as an inevitable outcome of low oil prices. \u201cIt\u2019s bound to lead to North Sea field shutdowns being brought forward,\u201d he says. \u201cEqually, unless there is a significant amount of tax incentives from government and major service cost reductions, it is going to be hard for companies to sanction new projects in the current environment.\u201d Shell also said it would reduce costs by $15bn over the next three years, continue with a major divestment programme and freeze its dividend. Texas-based ExxonMobil, the largest stock-market-quoted oil company in the world, reported a 21% slump in three-monthly profits and said it would halve its share buyback programme. BP, Shell and US oil companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips have announced plans to cut staff in Britain\u2019s oil capital of Aberdeen by between 200 and 300 each. But few will put a figure on overall global redundancies. The oil companies have been cancelling drilling rigs and forcing other equipment suppliers to reduce prices. Schlumberger, the world\u2019s largest oil field services group, said last month it would cut 9,000 jobs worldwide \u2013 7% of its workforce. \u201cThe new oil prices are clearly going to test the resilience of several North American land producers going forward,\u201d Schlumberger boss Paal Kibsgaard says, adding that it will hit \u201ctheir ability to get financing, their ability to continue to drive efficiencies and reduce costs, and their ability to maintain production at current levels\u201d. Meanwhile, rival Weatherford said it planned to axe 8,000 jobs globally. Recruitment firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas said last week that 21,000 jobs were lost from the US energy sector in January alone. \u201cThe economies throughout the northern United States that have been thriving as a result of the oil boom could experience a steep decline in employment across all sectors, including retail, construction, food service and entertainment,\u201d said the firm\u2019s chief executive, John Challenger. There could be further damage to the US jobs market, with one survey indicating that more than 40% of oil and gas companies plan to cut back on capital spending, and nearly one third will reduce their search for new talent. There is also pressure outside the Brent benchmark. The oil price slump comes at a difficult time for the industry, amid a growing campaign for fossil fuels to be kept in the ground to prevent further global warming. For the industry\u2019s sternest critics, the dismantling of the Brent field should be followed by mass decommissioning of oil sites around the world. There is also increasing pressure on pension funds to disinvest from oil and coal companies on the basis that they represent a \u201ccarbon bubble\u201d of overvalued and endangered assets. Governments whose economies depend on high commodity prices, such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela, have most to lose from a price slump. But countries that are dependent on imports \u2013 such as China and India \u2013 have a lot to gain as cheap energy reduces inflation and makes manufacturing more competitive. Under this scenario, jobs losses in the global oil industry are balanced with gains elsewhere. That situation could be played out in microcosm in the UK. Ministers are worried about the impact on the domestic oil and gas industry, which is said to support more than 350,000 jobs, but the economy overall stands to benefit from lower transport and other input costs. The average price of unleaded petrol fell to 106.65p a litre last week, compared with a peak of 131.7p in July last year, according to the AA. That peak is unlikely to be regained soon. The oil price had been rattling along at over $100 for three years when it began to fall in the middle of 2014, as traders and analysts began to panic about the soaring production from US shale producers. BP does not see a strong improvement in the oil price soon, although Shell is much more upbeat, despite the looming dismantling of the Brent field. Iain Reid at BMO has pencilled in an average price of $53 for 2015, $65 for 2016 and $80 longer term. But he admits no one is really sure what lies ahead. Meanwhile Molloy, now a trade union organiser at the RMT, is keen to keep the North Sea fields in operation. But he wants to make sure operators do not use the low oil price as an excuse to cut platform maintenance or compromise safety. And while the former offshore worker remembers working on Brent in 180-knot winds and -17C temperatures, he has warmer memories, too. \u201cOn the odd summer night when the platform was shut down and the [gas] flare was out, it was so dark you could lie on the deck looking up and see the Northern Lights and satellites overhead. People would pay thousands of pounds for that. Fantastic.\u201d CUTBACKS BP has cut 300 jobs in Aberdeen. It set aside $4.5bn in the last quarter to pay for North Sea costs, including the bringing forward of field closures. Shell has axed 250 North Sea-related jobs. ConocoPhillips plans to cut 230 Aberdeen jobs and has slashed its global spending budget by 20%. BG Group has written off $6bn, slimmed down its spending plans and has already axed 15% of its global workforce over the last 12 months. Chevron insists it is committed to its operations in the North Sea despite unveiling plans to axe 225 positions, almost a fifth of its Aberdeen workforce. Schlumberger, the exploration service group, plans to cut 9,000 jobs, including 100 in the UK. Weatherford, the service company, is planning to cut 8,000 jobs globally, with Aberdeen expected to shoulder 100 of the redundancies.",

      "bodyText": "America\u2019s fracking revolution is becoming a victim of its own success. The controversial boom in shale gas and oil has driven the US economic recovery and helped lower world crude prices. But a price plunge from $115 (\u00a375) a barrel last June to just above $50 last week means many shale operations no longer pay. Rigs across the US are being deactivated at a rate of nearly 100 a week. In the final week of January, 94 were pulled offline \u2013 the most since 1987, according to oil services company Baker Hughes. The number of active rigs fell by from 1,609 in October to 1,223 in January and some experts predict fewer than 1,000 will remain by the end of the year. \u201cThe low oil price is bringing to a halt the world\u2019s great engine of supply growth over the last five years,\u201d said James Burkhard, head of global oil market research for IHS Energy. \u201cThe US upstream is very responsive to changes in price and drilling is likely to slow down further until prices recover. \u201cThe great revival of US production has been from intensive onshore drilling. These aren\u2019t massive $7bn projects that can\u2019t be stopped: these are mostly onshore fracking that be started and stopped much more easily.\u201d Burkhard said the US fracking boom accounted for more than half of global oil supply growth over the last five years, and it is the easiest tap to turn off while the world waits for the oil price to recover. The US has built up its largest stockpile of crude in 84 years. The profitability of onshore US wells varies considerably, with some only turning a profit when oil price is as high as $90 while others can make money at $30. IHS says nearly 30% of new wells started in 2014 can break even at $81 a barrel. By comparison, Morgan Stanley says some Middle Eastern onshore production is profitable at $10 per barrel. Oil companies big and small have been knocked by falling prices. Chevron last month reported a 30% fall in quarterly profits (its worst since 2009), while oil exploration company ConocoPhillips swung to a loss as its average realised price fell 19% to $52.88 per barrel. Continental Resources, one of the largest drillers in North Dakota\u2019s Bakken shale, said late last year it would cut its active rigs by 40% this year, with three-quarters of cuts coming by April. North Dakota\u2019s Department of Mineral Resources says the state\u2019s producers need a wellhead price of around $55-$65 to sustain current output of 1.2m barrels per day. If similar cuts were made across the industry, the rig count would fall below 1,100 by the end of March and 950 by the end of the year. A collapse in US oil production \u2013 now at 12m barrels a day after rising from 5m in 2008 \u2013 is likely to have a big impact on the nation\u2019s economy. The fracking boom has made millionaires out of landowners, strengthened the country\u2019s energy security and created hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs. It\u2019s a very different story from 2012, when President Obama told the nation in his State of the Union address that fracking could create 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. \u201cLower oil prices tend to have a net positive impact on the US economy as [petrol] and consumer goods get cheaper,\u201d Burkhard said. \u201cBut the impact is more mixed this time because the US oil industry has been such an important engine of economic growth.\u201d John White, a senior research analyst at Roth Capital Partners, said: \u201cAll the economics for shale exploration are being reset. There is going to be much lower levels of drilling activity. \u201cIn the sweet spots of shale, drilling will continue, but you\u2019re going to see fewer wells drilled but more production per well.\u201d Other experts reckon the decline in production will only be temporary. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be punished here for six months, but then it will get back to normal,\u201d said Steven Kopits, president of Princeton Energy Advisors. \u201cThere is a tremendous roll-off [in production] at the moment: the industry is going to be hurting until the surplus is absorbed. But if I were a shale explorer I would want to survive for six months and wait for prices to recover.\u201d Raoul LeBlanc, IHS\u2019s energy director, said: \u201cIf oil prices remain weak and confidence in future prices remain shaken, US production in 2016 could possibly flatten or even decline. But there is plenty that could happen \u2013 a recovery in oil prices, lower upstream costs and improved well productivity \u2013 that would quickly change the calculus of drilling new wells and reinvigorate US production growth.\u201d",

North Dakota\u2019s Department of Mineral Resources says the state\u2019s producers need a wellhead price of around $55-$65 to sustain current output of 1.2m barrels per day.</p> <p>If similar cuts were made across the industry, the rig count would fall below 1,100 by the end of March and 950 by the end of the year.</p> <p>A collapse in US oil production \u2013 now at 12m barrels a day after rising from 5m in 2008 \u2013 is likely to have a big impact on the nation\u2019s economy. The fracking boom has made millionaires out of landowners, strengthened the country\u2019s energy security and created hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs. It\u2019s a very different story from 2012, when President Obama told the nation in his State of the Union address that fracking could create 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade.</p> <p>\u201cLower oil prices tend to have a net positive impact on the US economy as [petrol] and consumer goods get cheaper,\u201d Burkhard said. \u201cBut the impact is more mixed this time because the US oil industry has been such an important engine of economic growth.\u201d</p> <p>John White, a senior research analyst at Roth Capital Partners, said: \u201cAll the economics for shale exploration are being reset. There is going to be much lower levels of drilling activity.</p> <p>\u201cIn the sweet spots of shale, drilling will continue, but you\u2019re going to see fewer wells drilled but more production per well.\u201d</p> <p>Other experts reckon the decline in production will only be temporary. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be punished here for six months, but then it will get back to normal,\u201d said Steven Kopits, president of Princeton Energy Advisors. \u201cThere is a tremendous roll-off [in production] at the moment: the industry is going to be hurting until the surplus is absorbed. But if I were a shale explorer I would want to survive for six months and wait for prices to recover.\u201d</p> <p>Raoul LeBlanc, IHS\u2019s energy director, said: \u201cIf oil prices remain weak and confidence in future prices remain shaken, US production in 2016 could possibly flatten or even decline. But there is plenty that could happen \u2013 a recovery in oil prices, lower upstream costs and improved well productivity \u2013 that would quickly change the calculus of drilling new wells and reinvigorate US production growth.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A survey for the Groceries Code Adjudicator has shown that the suppliers of food are reluctant to complain of bullying by supermarket buyers. The survey, which comes just days after the watchdog\u2019s head, Christine Tacon, announced an investigation into the way Tesco does business with suppliers and urged people to come forward with evidence of malpractice. The findings will put pressure on Tacon, who was appointed in 2013 to oversee the Grocery Supply Code of Practice that was introduced in 2001 after a Competition Commission inquiry. In an indication of their fears, only 45 of 128 suppliers approached responded to the survey, which sought to establish how they were faring under the new regulatory regime, put in place over a year ago. The majority of those said they did not think retailers had changed their practices in the past six months. Nearly half of those who responded said they had suffered incorrect deductions from invoices, the most common complaint. The next most frequent problem, experienced by 44% of respondents, was a disputed demand for charges, which could be backdated for up to six years, or for a lump sum payment higher than previously agreed. Suppliers also complained of demands for fees in return for the right to be stocked by a retailer, lack of compensation for orders being lower than agreed, and instances of products being removed from shelves without reasonable notice. Several suppliers told the watchdog they were concerned it did not have sufficient power to bring about real change or protect them. One said it wanted to see \u201cproof that the GCA has \u2018teeth\u2019 and evidence it can act against retailers, without suppliers being implicated\u201d. Tacon said in her latest news update that the issue of \u201cforensic auditing\u201d \u2013 where retailers search several years\u2019 worth of suppliers\u2019 accounts for money they might be owed \u2013 had been resolved but some suppliers were not convinced. One pointed out that Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose had opted out of a voluntary agreement, signed by eight other retailers, to put a time limit on such searches. Others said they could not be sure their complaints to Tacon would not get back to clients and cost them business. David Sables, a consultant who advises suppliers on negotiation tactics, said: \u201cRetribution can come in many ways, and ways in which it would be very difficult for the GCA to identify \u2026 Buyers can kill you and make it look like an accident.\u201d In her latest news update last Friday, Tacon insisted that \u201cdespite the current challenges in the sector, more respondents believe that relations with retailers have improved than think they have worsened.\u201d Suppliers\u2019 concerns about the extent of Tacon\u2019s powers echo the adjudicator herself, who has complained it has taken the government more than a year to put forward legislation giving her the power to fine retailers up to 1% of turnover for breaches of the code. The delay has meant Tacon will not be able to fine Tesco, no matter what the outcome of her investigation, as she will only be able impose penalties for breaches that take place after MPs approve her powers. Launching her investigation into Tesco last week, Tacon urged suppliers to come forward if they had evidence of breaches of the code by supermarkets. She said she could widen her inquiry if she had reasonable grounds for suspicion that others were not complying. She can force companies to give evidence and said she would protect the anonymity of anyone giving information. Tacon launched her probe into Tesco after she reviewed the findings of an internal investigation carried out by accountancy firm Deloitte for the supermarket, in the wake of last September\u2019s \u00a3263m accounting scandal relating to supplier payments. She said she was looking at possible violations by Tesco involving many suppliers and large sums of money, including: penalties being imposed when Tesco claimed items were missing from deliveries; charging suppliers more than an item cost if a customer returned it; delaying refunds when it incorrectly issued duplicate invoices; and imposing charges for in-store promotions that were either incorrect or not agreed. THE BIG ISSUES Complaints (% of suppliers reporting) 47% Incorrect deductions from invoices 44% Incorrectly seeking charges going back up to six years 44% Demand for lump sum payments higher than agreed 38% Demand to pay listing fees (to get goods on shelves) 35% Demand to use a particular packaging supplier 32% De-listing without reasonable notice 29% Demand for marketing payments higher than agreed 23% Overbuying at promotional price and then selling at full price",
