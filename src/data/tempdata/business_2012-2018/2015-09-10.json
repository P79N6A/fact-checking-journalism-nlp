      "bodyText": "Preparing for a possible stampede, the Irish discount retailer Primark had set up row upon row of crowd control barriers in front of its flagship Boston store \u2013 its first in the US. It didn\u2019t need them. Years of planning have gone into the opening. Ninety minutes before the doors opened on Thursday, just 11 people were queuing outside the former Filene\u2019s department store in downtown Boston. \u201cI got here at 8am, and I was the first in line,\u201d said Peri Tur, 21, a student who caught the \u2018Primania\u2019 bug when on an internship at the Palace of Westminster in London. \u201cI certainly expected it to be much more popular. I used to live in London so I\u2019m very much aware of it \u2013 but maybe people here aren\u2019t \u2013 it was one of the very few things that was affordable in London.\u201d Tur, who is from Las Vegas but studying archaeology and international relations at Boston University, said she expected a buzz about Primark would start to build quickly when local people begin to realise just how cheap its clothes are. Tur, who said she \u201cprobably shouldn\u2019t buy anything, but I\u2019ll probably end up buying more shoes\u201d, reckoned Primark\u2019s clothes and shoes were about 40% cheaper than US budget rival chains TJ Maxx and Marshalls. The \u201camazing prices\u201d have been drilled into the 590 staff hired to run the store. Paul Gassner, Primark\u2019s regional manager who will oversee this and three other of Primark\u2019s eight to 10 planned US stores, makes sure to point out all the prices on a tour of the four-floor 77,000 sq ft store. There are skinny jeans for $7 (\u00a34.50), sweaters for $8, sneakers (trainers) for $9, and suitcase to carry it all home in for $30-50. \u201cThe prices really are amazing,\u201d Gassner said.\u201dIt\u2019s just so much cheaper than you would get elsewhere.\u201d He is visibly excited as he points out bespoke metal fretwork designed to complement the 1911 Beaux Arts Filene\u2019s building. But the most impressive element to the store, in his opinion, are the banks of 84 fitting rooms (complete with sofa areas for friends to discuss their possible purchases) and a man-friendly phone charging and chillout zone. \u201cIf the men can\u2019t keep up with their lady friends, we\u2019ll have ESPN streaming live from 8am.\u201d Gassner, who joined Primark from more upmarket rival Macy\u2019s, has really bought into Primark. \u201cThis suit,\u201d he says pointing at a rack of Cedar Wood suits. \u201cIs $70. I am modelling this suit, and it feels great.\u201d A member of the tour group jokes that it may look nice, but advises not to \u201cstand too close to a naked flame\u201d. When asked Gassner doesn\u2019t know what material the suit is made from and looks at the label. \u201c100% wool shell, with a polyester lining. That\u2019s better than I thought,\u201d he says. Gassner was not the only executive proudly wearing Primark as Marty Walsh, the mayor of Boston, officially opened the store on Thursday. Breege O\u2019Donoghue, Primark\u2019s group director of business development and new markets, who at 71 is slightly out of the stores target age range, is wearing a \u201cblue three-piece ensemble\u201d which she said cost $50. John Bason, finance director of Primark\u2019s parent company, Associated British Food, is wearing a \u201cmixture\u201d of Primark and other labels. \u201cI could show you if you really want,\u201d he says jokingly tugging at his waistband. Bason said he was really pleased with how the opening of the store (the company\u2019s 292nd) had gone, but admitted to quite a few months of nervous anxiety in the buildup. He said he wasn\u2019t concerned that there weren\u2019t too many people waiting to get into the store before it opened, and said he reckoned about 1,000 had been through the doors in the first hour. It was different, he conceded, to the opening of a new Primark store on London\u2019s Oxford Street in 2007 when 3,000 people overwhelmed 50 security guards and stampeded into the store, injuring two staff badly enough to require hospital treatment. Bason said he had never expected the Boston opening to be overwhelmed by eager shoppers as Primark\u2019s brand does not have the awareness it does in the UK or Europe, but he hopes that will change rapidly. The company hosted influential fashionistas and bloggers at a reception in the store on Wednesday night and hopes they will spread the word on social media. \u201cWe\u2019re not suddenly opening the doors,\u201d Bason said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing targeted awareness [raising] in the fashion media \u2013 I think there is a high awareness of our coming, certainly there is in the industry. We\u2019ve got to get that translated into our customers, it\u2019s the customers that really matter. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be word of mouth, not mainstream advertising, that\u2019s how we did it in the UK in the 1990s,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it will be via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and so on.\u201d Signs throughout the store encourage customers to take photos of their new purchases and upload them to social media with the hashtag #Primania. However, outside the store in Boston\u2019s Downtown Crossing area protesters are also asking customers to tweet photos of them. The United Food &amp; Commercial Workers (UFCW) union is protesting against Primark\u2019s refusal to meet with them to discuss the unionisation of its employees and low wages paid. In the US, employees can vote on whether or not to establish a union. Fabricio DaSilva, UFCW\u2019s campaign director, said Primark\u2019s management had failed to create an environment where its workers felt they could happily discuss unionisation. \u201cThey are ignoring us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should discuss it with us and with their staff.\u201d Bason said Primark was not trying to stop staff joining a union but said it was for staff to decide on their own without the influence of the company. DaSilva said Primark\u2019s US staff are paid as little as $10 an hour. Primark refused to state how much staff are paid, but said rates were \u201ccompetitive with that of similar retailers\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Shell has been forced to leave a Prince of Wales climate change project which it helped found after a row over the oil company\u2019s controversial drilling programme in the Arctic. The departure from the Prince of Wales\u2019s Corporate Leader Group is another embarrassing setback for the oil and gas company, which has been battling to preserve its reputation in the face of a vociferous and growing campaign against its operations in the Chukchi Sea off the coast of Alaska. Greenpeace said the Anglo-Dutch group was rapidly becoming a pariah in the business world. The exit was announced in a short note on the climate change programme\u2019s website, based at Cambridge University, which said: \u201cAs of September 2015 longstanding member Royal Dutch Shell is no longer a member.\u201d Sources said there had been a falling out with other companies unhappy about Shell exploring for more fossil fuels in the Arctic. Many experts believe that some existing oil and gas reserves cannot be burned if CO2 levels are not to rise to dangerous levels. They feel further drilling is not needed, especially in such high cost areas. A Shell spokesman declined to comment on why the company had left the group which includes Unilever, Tesco and others, saying it was a matter for the other members to explain. He said: \u201cWe can confirm that we are no longer a member of the Corporate Leaders\u2019 Group, of which we were a founder member in 2005. Over that period, both Shell and the CLG have worked to support the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which we believe should be the main driver of change in the EU energy system.\u201d The spokesman defended the company\u2019s stance on Alaskan drilling which was recently given the go-ahead by Barack Obama but which has been opposed by Democratic leadership hopeful, Hillary Clinton, and many others. \u201cWe believe we can play an important role in developing the world\u2019s energy resources, including those in the Arctic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe choose to explore there because we have the expertise and experience to operate responsibly and be profitable at the same time.\u201d But environmental group Greenpeace said Shell was gradually being shunned by others in the business world. \u201cThis is just the latest in a long line of partners that have walked away from Shell because of its hypocritical stance on climate and Arctic oil drilling,\u201d said Charlie Kronick, Arctic campaigner at Greenpeace. \u201cWhile Shell likes to pretend it\u2019s a climate leader, in reality it is a climate pariah \u2026 It\u2019s no surprise that Shell\u2019s friends and allies are dropping like flies.\u201d",

Not at Next, it won\u2019t, assuming the company\u2019s chief executive, Lord Wolfson, has got his calculations correct, which is usually a safe bet. Wolfson, while avoiding saying whether he supports or opposes chancellor George Osborne\u2019s flagship pay policy for those aged 25 and over, injected some much-needed sober analysis into the debate on Thursday. There were three main points, only one of which even vaguely supports the alarmists\u2019 case. First, it\u2019s clear the immediate impact on Next will be tiny. The company was moving to a \u201cstarter\u201d rate of \u00a37.04 anyway, so an increase to \u00a37.20 next April can be lost in the wash. The cost is estimated at \u00a32m, even when the need to maintain pay differentials is included. Second, the eventual impact is greater \u2013 \u00a327m a year by 2020. That is more eye-catching but requires context. Next is a big company, with annual sales of \u00a34bn and a current payroll of \u00a3600m. Wolfson\u2019s description of the \u00a327m \u2013 \u201cnot immaterial ... but not transformative\u201d \u2013 is fair. The company can handle it. Indeed, Wolfson says compensating for the \u00a327m would require an increase in selling prices of about 1%. But, note, that\u2019s over four years and ignores productivity gains. Such a price rise is \u201cunlikely to have a material effect on the trading performance of the business\u201d, says Wolfson. Quite: foreign exchange rates and the cost of cotton are likely to be more important for profits. So far, so good. The third point gets to the heart of the arithmetic behind the national living wage. In short, the government\u2019s ambition, between 2016 and 2020, is to lift the rate from \u00a37.20 to at least \u00a39. But most of the work is assumed to be done by regular pay inflation in the economy, which the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts at 4.5% per annum. As Wolfson argues, there could be problems if the actual rate is less than 3.5%. A \u201cpotentially harmful inflationary loop\u201d could be created, he says, because the national living wage would have to exceed the intended goal of 60% of median wages. That is a legitimate worry, even if it will be a couple of years before the fog clears. For the short term, however, Next\u2019s analysis should quieten the scaremongers. Companies\u2019 cost bases differ but this much seems clear: the national living wage will not destroy the profits of successful mainstream retailers. Back to basics in store David Potts\u2019 formula for reviving Morrisons will win no prizes for revolutionary thinking. Part of the plan to \u201cserve customers better\u201d \u2013 one of six humdrum strategic priorities \u2013 involves displaying wines by country of origin, which is what most supermarkets already do. Is lack of originality a drawback? Probably not. A dose of back-to-basics retailing, with a concentration on the core supermarkets, is probably what Morrisons needs. It would be more worrying if Potts had summoned a crew of consultants to invent something novel. Will it work? The chain has now entered its fourth year of declining like-for-like sales and Potts, probably sensibly, declined to predict when the bottom will be reached. Improvement \u201cwill be a long journey\u201d, he concluded, which is what chief executives say when the problems run deep. On the plus side, Morrisons generates cash and has a strong balance sheet. That gives Potts freedom to undertake the long journey. But the destination for profits, down by almost by a half to \u00a3126m in the six months, is unknown. What price risk? \u201cThe pressure on financial performance ... will be as intense in the medium term as at any time over the last decade.\u201d No, not Morrisons again; it\u2019s the Lloyd\u2019s of London insurance market. At the moment, Lloyd\u2019s is coping well. Profits fell from \u00a31.65bn to \u00a31.19bn in the six months, but a drop in investment income lay behind more than half the decline. At the underwriting level, the outcome was still strong. The combined ratio \u2013 a measure of how much premium income is paid out in claims and expenses \u2013 was 89.5%, which is decent, historically speaking. Why the warning? It\u2019s simple: capital continues to pour into the insurance and reinsurance markets, chasing the double-digit returns that Lloyd\u2019s has achieved for the last three years. The result is that premium rates look too low. On current form, Lloyd\u2019s is better equipped than international rivals to deal with another year like 2011, which experienced floods in Thailand and Australia, a huge earthquake in New Zealand and the Japanese tsunami. But the wider message is alarming, if not surprising: in a world of low interest rates, risk is being mis-priced and, sooner or later, there will be a price to pay.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne has received a new warning about the potential impact of his new tax on banks amid concerns it will impede new entrants to the sector. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, raised the potential competition threat on the eve of a meeting between Treasury officials and representatives of the challenger banks, such as Metro and Secure Trust, about the tax which was announced in July\u2019s budget. Banks are to pay an extra 8% of corporation tax on profits over \u00a325m, while the bank levy \u2013 introduced in 2010 and based on the size of banks\u2019 balance sheets \u2013 is being scaled back. Taken together, the policies are regarded as benefiting major banks with international operations, such as HSBC and Standard Chartered, at the expense of smaller, newer banks, which would not have fallen into the scope of the bank levy. Paul Lyman, chief executive of Secure Trust and chair of the British Bankers\u2019 Association\u2019s challenger bank panel, said if the Treasury was not ready to make changes it should create a more level playing field. \u201cWe want to find out if the government remains as committed as they said they are to competition in the banking market,\u201d he said. Tyrie said the Competition and Markets Authority, which is expected to publish its preliminary findings on high street and small business banking next month, should look at the impact of the tax. \u201cMillions of consumers and small businesses have been getting a poor deal for decades because of inadequate competition and choice in banking. It is crucial that this surcharge does not act as an impediment to the government\u2019s efforts to increase competition in the sector,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is something that the CMA will want to take into account in their retail banking market investigation, and that the committee will be discussing with them when they complete their work.\u201d Four banks \u2013 Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays \u2013 control a combined market share of about 75% of small business and retail banking. The CMA\u2019s findings into the banking sector, originally due in September, are expected in October. The watchdog said: \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the issue and it\u2019s something we\u2019ll be considering as part of our ongoing and wide ranging investigation.\u201d The 8% corporation tax surcharge will be imposed from January, while from 2021, the bank levy \u2013 which has brought in \u00a38bn in five years \u2013 is to be focused on the UK element of bank balance sheets rather than their global balance sheet. During the budget, Osborne told MPs the levy \u201crisks doing harm\u201d without the change and that the surcharge was needed to keep revenue from banks coming in. The Treasury said before the meeting with the challenger banks that it had taken steps to support their growth. \u201cWe\u2019ve put competition at the heart of the regulatory system, significantly reduced barriers to new banks entering the market, and made sure that all banks \u2013 big or small \u2013 can access the payment systems on fair terms. We are also creating a tax regime for the banking sector that is sustainable and fair, and any bank that makes less than \u00a325m profit a year will be exempt from the banking tax surcharge.\u201d John Mann, a Labour MP who sits on the Treasury select committee, has tabled an amendment to the finance bill to exempt any bank or building society from paying the tax if it has a balance sheet of less than \u00a325bn \u2013 essentially the new entrants and many of the building societies. Tyrie, however, said both banks and building societies carried risks, citing evidence from Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England and head of the regulation arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, in March.",

      "bodyText": "The Billy bookcase, Po\u00e4ng chair and Bumerang coathanger continue to spread relentlessly around the world, as Ikea unveiled another year of rising sales. The Swedish company said it had rung up sales of \u20ac32bn (\u00a323bn) in the year to the end of August, another step towards its goal of hitting \u20ac50bn by 2020. Sales were up 5% on the previous year in comparable stores. Getting lost in Ikea\u2019s maze-like stores or struggling to put together a flatpack table are becoming common experiences around the world: Ikea has 328 stores across 28 countries, with Croatia joining the list in 2014. The company estimates it had 771m visits during its latest financial year. China, home to eight of Ikea\u2019s 10 largest stores, remains the company\u2019s fastest-growing market, as continued mass migration into cities helps create a middle class with money to spend. In 2014, Ikea opened a second store in Beijing and a new shop in Chongqing, a city of 10 million people. Russia, where the Swedish company spent years fighting corruption, is Ikea\u2019s second fastest-growing market. Ikea\u2019s performance in Russia was boosted by its Mega shopping centres, a chain of 14 complexes from St Petersburg to Novosibirsk. Ikea reported that Germany also experienced record growth, while North America performed well. In southern Europe there was \u201cpositive progress\u201d, amid an upturn in economic growth in Spain and Italy, despite persistent youth unemployment. When Ikea advertised for staff to work in a Valencia store in late 2013, tens of thousands of people applied for just 400 jobs \u2013 250 applicants for every one place. The store, which opened in 2014, is now said to be one of its biggest-selling stores in the country. Peter Agnefj\u00e4ll, president and chief executive of the Ikea group, said: \u201cWe are growing in almost all our markets and we are happy about last year\u2019s sales development.\u201d He added that Ikea would continue to increase sales in store and online: \u201cLooking ahead, we see many opportunities for us to continue to grow through our stores and by meeting our customers in new exciting ways in our multichannel environment \u2013 a journey we have only just begun.\u201d Ikea, which only started publishing information about its profits in 2010, will publish a more detailed financial report in December 2015. Ikea is the world\u2019s largest furniture retailer, including in the UK, where it has been selling its flatpack minimalist furniture and low-cost homeware since 1987. However, it faces stiff competition. Last month, the boss of John Lewis vowed that the department store would knock Ikea off the top spot in the UK within four years. Ikea is expected to have 6% of the UK market for homeware, furniture and flooring sales in 2015, while John Lewis will have 5.8%, according to retail consultancy Conlumino.",

      "bodyText": "The revolution underway in food shopping has been underlined after Morrisons announced it was closing 11 big supermarkets, and Waitrose revealed falling sales for the first time in seven years. The closure of the Morrisons stores puts 900 jobs at risk and was revealed as the food retailer reported that profits have almost halved in the last six months. Morrisons is one of Britain\u2019s big four supermarket chains alongside Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s. All are suffering from falling sales as shoppers turn away from supermarkets in favour of buying more of their groceries either from local convenience stores, online or at the discount chains such as Aldi and Lidl. Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership (JLP), had proved immune to the pressure since the onset of the financial crisis. However, its like-for-like sales, which exclude new store openings, are down on a year ago. The upmarket grocer said like-for-like sales fell 1.3% in the six months to 1 August as it was forced to cut prices to compete with cheaper rivals. This meant that although the volume of products sold by Waitrose rose 1.8%, the value of its sales fell. Waitrose lost its position as the country\u2019s sixth-largest food retailer to Aldi earlier this year, and the expansion of Aldi and its fellow German discounter Lidl shows little sign of abating. Lidl wants to open dozens of new stores in Waitrose\u2019s upmarket London heartland. This includes shops in Chelsea, Notting Hill and Highgate, some of the capital\u2019s wealthiest areas. Lidl plans to open 281 stores inside the M25 as part of plans to more than double in size to as many as 1,500 UK shops within the next decade. At the same time, the big four are closing shops and scrapping plans to open new supermarkets. As well as shutting 11 stores, Morrisons intends to open only two more shops in Britain after scrapping two-thirds of the projects in its pipeline. David Potts, the new chief executive of Morrisons, has also pulled the retailer out of high street convenience stores. On Wednesday, Morrisons announced it had sold 140 of its M Local stores for \u00a325m, describing its small stores as a \u201cdistraction\u201d. Potts, who replaced the sacked Dalton Philips in March, warned it would take years to turn around Morrisons and that it must be done \u201cshelf by shelf, store by store\u201d. \u201cThis is a long and important journey. It will take years, not months,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is much affection for the Morrisons brand, albeit that affection has been challenged. If we listen to our customers, they say our identity has become quite blurred over the years.\u201d Morrisons\u2019 pretax profits fell from \u00a3239m to \u00a3126m in the six months to 2 August. The year-on-year drop was driven by a 2.7% decline in like-for-like sales. Potts is aiming to get Morrisons back on track by tailoring the products in each supermarket to the demands of the local community, adding 5,000 staff to stores, making the company\u2019s pricing and promotions simpler, and introducing new in-store services such as mobile phone repairs. Morrisons also intends to grow its online grocery service, which is run by rival Ocado. Potts said the deal with Ocado was part of a \u201cbroader digital opportunity\u201d for Morrisons, with the retailer looking to expand the service to Scotland and launch a click-and-collect option. John Ibbotson, analyst at consultantcy Retail Vision, said: \u201cMorrisons has consistently been behind the game. Late to online and with a high-cost operation, late to convenience and then selling out, late expansion in the rich south and now under threat from the discounters in its northern heartland. \u201cMorrisons says in its latest results that the turnaround will take time, but how much time has it got? This is a retailer that is ripe for takeover.\u201d The grocer could face further pressure on its profits from the introduction of the national living wage, which Potts said would cost \u201ctens of millions\u201d of pounds to implement. Morrisons has almost 119,000 UK staff. Although Waitrose also suffered a fall in sales, its operating profits at least rose by 0.6% to \u00a3136m. This means its profits are now larger than Morrisons, despite the FTSE 100 company generating almost three times more in sales than Waitrose. \u201cWe are pleased with the trajectory we are on,\u201d Mark Price, the managing director of Waitrose sales, said. \u201cWe want to move on from where we are, but in this market that won\u2019t be easy.\u201d However, JLP as a whole, including John Lewis, suffered a sharp fall in profits due to higher pension costs and redundancy payments to staff in distribution centres. JLP reported a 26% fall in pretax profits before one-off items to \u00a396m in the six months to 1 August. More than 250 jobs are at risk at John Lewis as it closes three distribution centres in Milton Keynes, one in Stevenage, and one in Carlisle. Workers at the depots have been offered jobs elsewhere in JLP, but the group has booked potential redundancy costs as a \u00a34m restructuring charge in its accounts. The retailer also warned in its results that pension costs have ballooned by \u00a360m as it battles to manage a \u00a31.2bn pension deficit. Sir Charlie Mayfield, JLP\u2019s chairman, said it was a difficult market for John Lewis and Waitrose but called the performance solid. JLP operates 44 John Lewis stores and 340 Waitrose branches, employing almost 90,000 people.",

      "bodyText": "One last thing.... Wall Street has ended the day higher, bucking the general trend in the markets today. The Dow gained 80 points, or almost 0.5%, led by that Apple rally. Rising oil prices also gave the index a lift. Traders remain edgy after the recent volatility, as CNBC explains: There\u2019s still continued lack of conviction and any real liquidity,\u201d said Myles Clouston, senior director at Nasdaq. \u201cInvestors have been spooked by what\u2019s happened in the last month, month-and-a-half.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a great day in the European stock markets, with the main indices all finishing in the red. Investor confidence was hit early today, by the producer prices survey showing that Chinese firms are cutting prices sharply. Brazil\u2019s downgrade and New Zealand\u2019s interest rate cut also hit sentiment. The Bank of England\u2019s rate decision, and accompanying minutes, didn\u2019t move the dial -- although there is (as usual) disagreement over how soon the Bank may raise rates (or even if they should at all) Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets has helpfully rounded up the main action in the City: European stocks snapped a three-day winning streak on Thursday. The drop comes one week before the Federal Reserve decides whether to hike interest rates. Until the decision\u2019s made, markets are likely to remain on edge. House builders topped the FTSE 100 with Barratt Developments leading the field with gains of over 2% after a report forecasting the supply/demand misbalance of housing in the UK is set to send house prices higher still. The report is really just projecting current conditions like strong consumer confidence and low interest rates into the future. Corporate results from Britain\u2019s high street were a bit of a mixed bag. Next was a top riser after beating earnings expectations and taking a more muted stance that Whitbread on the minimum wage, saying it was manageable. Dixons Carphone shares jumped after sales rose but a fall in sales at Argos hurt Home Retail Group results sending shares lower. Morrisons was a top faller after the company reported a massive 47% drop in profits for the first half, a day after reporting the sale of 140 M Local convenience stores. Traditionally targeting the smaller budget consumer, Morrisons has been hard hit by customers switching to discounters Aldi and Lidl. And that\u2019s all for today, I think. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Apple is helping to push the US stock market up today, as analysts digest last night\u2019s flurry of announcements from the tech giant. Shares in Apple are up 2.1%, leading the Dow Jones industrial average. That claws back yesterday\u2019s losses, as Wall Street failed to be initially impressed by the new extra-large 12-inch iPad and the Apple Pencil (which generated plenty of fun on social media). The Dow is now up 107 points, or 0.6%. Economics professor Danny Blanchflower, a former Bank of England policymaker, isn\u2019t impressed by the tone of the minutes of this week\u2019s meeting. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Blanchflower argues that the Monetary Policy Committee can\u2019t simply brush aside the weakness in China\u2019s economy. It\u2019s also risky to ignore recent data showing the UK economy is slowing, with inflation potentially turning negative soon, he added. He\u2019s now tweeted this message too, in typical rumbustious fashion: Blanchflower also told Bloomberg that the situation reminded him of his time on hte MPC in 2008, when the committee was worried about inflation risks rather than the looming financial crisis and global recession. Bank of England governor Mark Carney didn\u2019t hand around in London to catch the reaction to today\u2019s interest rate decision. He\u2019s in China now, in his role as head of the Financial Stability Board, meeting with Chinese vice-premier Wang Yang. The Xinhua newswire says the pair are discussing \u201cthe economic and financial situation in the world and China\u201d. A good chance for Carney to judge the situation in China, and the government\u2019s response, for himself. Brazil\u2019s stock market is retreating after S&amp;P downgraded its credit rating to junk overnight (see details here). The Bovespa index has dropped by 1.7%, back towards the six-year low touched last week. And the country\u2019s currency, the real, is hitting fresh record lows against the US dollar. It\u2019s now trading at 3.89 to the US dollar, after S&amp;P questioned Brazil\u2019s ability to manage its public finances in the current recession, with commodity prices so weak. Luiz Carlos Baldan, a director of the Fourtrade brokerage in S\u00e3o Paulo, told the WSJ that traders fear further losses. \u201cThis downgrade wasn\u2019t priced in by the forex market. If the central bank doesn\u2019t intervene, the real could hit 4 to the dollar in the next few days.\u201d After a slightly rocky start in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average has gained 0.2%. The S&amp;P 500 dipped by 0.1% at the open. If you\u2019re catching up now, here\u2019s the latest data from China that has worried the markets: More details here. Europe\u2019s stock markets are falling deeper into the red, as traders anticipate fresh falls when Wall Street opens in 20 minutes time. As covered this morning, investors have gone back to worrying about the slowing Chinese economy and the potential that US interest rates are raised next week. Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, says China is casting a big shadow over the economy. He said (via Reuters) \u201cWhat is China going to do? That is the biggest unknown for people at the moment.\u201d On Wednesday, there appeared to be genuine optimism in the markets. But it\u2019s been quickly eroded. Here are the main European markets: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, predicts that UK interest rates will remain frozen for another year or more. Today\u2019s Bank minutes show that some MPC policymakers are steering away from an early rate rise, he argues: \u201cThe more dovish tone is largely a function of the changes in the international environment. Though members felt that global developments had not yet \u201calter[ed] materially the central outlook described in the August Inflation Report\u201d, there was a consensus that the downside risks had escalated. Beck predicts the first UK rate hike will come in the third quarter of 2016. \u201cAt the current pace, there may be an EU referendum before we see a rate increase,\u201d says Nick Dixon, investment director at Aegon UK. He argues that, despite Ian McCafferty\u2019s itchy trigger finger, many MPC members may see the merits in leaving rates unchanged for many months. With muted consumer spending and earnings growth, coupled with low oil prices and broader inflationary pressures, there is a credible case for the Bank to keep rates lower for longer, or even cut them to provide relief to consumers. With the strong pound also dragging down exports, we are unlikely to see any upward revision of interest rates until well into 2016.\u201d We don\u2019t know when Britain will vote on whether to leave the European Union - except that the ballot is before the end of 2017. It\u2019s no surprise that the BoE sat on its hands this month, given the problems overseas, says Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown: The concerns are numerous. A slowing Chinese economy and devaluation of the yuan, concerns over the health of other major emerging markets (Brazil\u2019s debt was downgraded to junk status overnight - the first BRIC economy to lose investment grade status since the financial crisis began), and the resulting volatility in commodity prices could all create headwinds for the UK economy There\u2019s lots of reaction to today\u2019s decision. Maike Currie, associate investment director at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, isn\u2019t surprised that the Bank of England resisted raising rates, given problems overseas: A slowdown in emerging market economies means deflationary forces are mounting across the globe and the net effect on developed markets will be to entrench and embed the \u2018ice age\u2019 conditions of low rates, for longer. There\u2019s little significant reaction in the financial markets. The pound jumped a little when the Bank\u2019s decision was announced, but has now dropped back: Sterling had already risen against most other currencies today: My colleague Heather Stewart is at the Bank of England, digesting the minutes. Here\u2019s her take: Bank of England policymakers fear China\u2019s slowdown could \u201cadd to the global headwinds\u201d facing the UK economy in the coming months, but it is too early to derail their plans to raise interest rates off course. One member of the Bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee, former CBI economist Ian McCafferty, voted for an immediate increase in borrowing costsfrom their record low of 0.5% at the meeting that concluded on Wednesday \u2014 the same voting pattern as in August. But the minutes of the meeting, published on Thursday, offer the first insight into how UK policymakers are weighing the potential costs of China\u2019s downturn for economic recovery at home. Developments in China, where crashing share prices and a devaluation of the yuan unleashed shockwaves across global financial markets in August, were, \u201cthe main focus of the committee\u2019s decision\u201d, the minutes show. They concede that, \u201cthese developments have the potential to add to the global headwinds to UK growth and inflation\u201d. However, balancing the risks for the UK from a Chinese downturn against robust domestic demand, the MPC concluded there was not yet any reason to tweak the relatively upbeat forecasts for the economic outlook set out in last month\u2019s quarterly inflation report. \u201cGlobal developments do not as yet appear sufficient to alter materially the central outlook described in the August Report, but the greater downside risks to the global environment merit close monitoring for any impact on domestic economic activity\u201d, the minutes say. And here\u2019s Heather\u2019s full story: The word \u201cChina\u201d appears 10 times across the seven pages of today\u2019s Bank minutes. That underlines the importance of the shock devaluation of the yuan last month, which triggered the Great Fall of China and market turbulence worldwide. The minutes include this reminder of the drama that unfolded over the summer: First, on 11 August the People\u2019s Bank of China had lowered the central parity of the Renminbi exchange rate against the dollar by 1.9% compared with the previous day. It also announced a change to the mechanism for determining the central parity of the Renminbi which led to a further depreciation. Second, against the backdrop of the policy measures to support the stock market announced by the Chinese authorities in June and July, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index had dropped by 8% on 24 August, leading to substantial falls in both advanced economy and emerging market equity indices. In total over the period since the MPC\u2019s previous meeting, equity prices had fallen by 5-10% in the United Kingdom, United States and euro area. Ian McCafferty, the lone hawk on the committee, argued once again that rates should begin rising now. He believes that private domestic demand will remain strong, with consumer and business confidence at high levels. And by raising rates a little now, the Bank runs less risk of having to hike aggressively in the future. This argument has been raging on the MPC for months. It\u2019s worth noting that there are a range of views among the Monetary Policy Committee about the risks of inflation. Some see \u201ccontinued upside risks to inflation relative to the target\u201d, suggesting they are closer to voting to raise rates. The Bank of England\u2019s message is that the recent volatility in the financial markets, and the Chinese slowdown, does not radically change their view of the economy. They do warn that \u201cthe downside risks to world activity had probably increased\u201d, but argue that it\u2019s simply too early to conclude that Britain\u2019s economy is at risk Indeed, the Bank still expects to see \u201chealthy domestic expansion\u201d in the UK. Here\u2019s the key section of the minutes: Domestic momentum is being underpinned by robust real income growth, supportive credit conditions, and elevated business and consumer confidence. The rate of unemployment has fallen by over 2 percentage points since the middle of 2013, although that decline has levelled off more recently. Global developments do not as yet appear sufficient to alter materially the central outlook described in the August Report, but the greater downside risks to the global environment merit close monitoring for any impact on domestic economic activity. The Bank of England is encouraged that Greece agreed its third bailout last month, although this calm may not last for long: It says: The outline agreement between Greece and its euro-area partners had reduced the likelihood of further harm to activity and confidence from that source, at least in the near term. By contrast, concerns about China and other emerging economies had grown. The Bank of England is concerned that the risks faced by emerging markets such as China have increased, since its last meeting in August. The Monetary Policy Committee says: The Committee noted in the August Report that the risks to the growth outlook were skewed moderately to the downside, in part reflecting risks to activity in the euro area and China. Developments since then have increased the risks to prospects in China, as well as to other emerging economies. This led to markedly higher volatility in commodity prices and global financial markets. However, these developments are not yet serious enough to materially damage the UK recovery, it adds. Today\u2019s decision means that UK borrowing costs have been pegged at 0.5% since March 2009. The summary of the meeting is online here: Bank of England maintains Bank Rate at 0.5% and the size of the Asset Purchase Programme at \u00a3375 billion And here\u2019s a link to the full minutes: The Bank voted 9-0 to leave the current quantitative easing programme unchanged. It has already bought \u00a3375bn of government bonds under the scheme. Here we go! The Bank of England has decided to leave interest rates at their current record low of 0.5%. But the decision wasn\u2019t unanimous -- the MPC was split 8-1, with Ian McCafferty again voting to raise borrowing costs to 0.75%. Jus time to flag up that the Bank of England wants your help to reform the financial markets and make them work better: Just 30 minutes to go until the Bank of England announces this month\u2019s monetary policy decision. The real interest, though, lies in the minutes of the meeting which will be released at the same time. Economists will be looking to see How the committee split. Last month it voted 8-1 in favour of no change. The Bank\u2019s view of China. August\u2019s meeting was held before Beijing devalued the yuan, spooking market worldwide. Has that decision, and its impact, changed the MPC\u2019s view of the global situation? Whether the Bank is worried about the UK economy. Recent economic data has been rather soft, suggesting growth is tailing off a little. The inflation view. Does the Bank see inflationary pressures building, especially as retailers warn that they\u2019ll raise prices to cover the cost of the \u2018national living wage\u2019? And here\u2019s another handy chart from RBS, showing how the City has constantly over-estimated the chance of UK interest rates rising since the crisis began. City economist have pushed back their expectations for the first UK interest rate hike over the last month, as the global economic picture darkened: Ireland has shaken off the malaise in the global economy, by posting remarkably strong growth figures. Irish GDP jumped by 1.9% during the quarter, beating forecasts of 1%. This means the economy grew by a stonking 6.7% over the last year. Ireland\u2019s GNP, or gross national product, also rose by 1.9% quarter-on-quarter, and was 5.3% higher year-on-year. GNP strips out the impact of multinational companies, so is a better guide to the underlying health of the economy. After three days of gains, Europe\u2019s stock markets are slipping back this morning. The main indices are down by between 0.5% and 1.1%, as the rally that began on Monday is derailed. The usual culprits are to blame. Namely: China, after today\u2019s data showed producers slashing prices at a faster rate to generate demand. The US, with investors continuing to fret that the US Federal Reserve might raise interest rates next week. Brazil\u2019s credit rating downgrade, and New Zealand\u2019s interest rate cut, have also dampened the mood, as traders brace for the Bank of England\u2019s decision at noon. The markets will probably remain volatile until the Fed\u2019s decision, next week. Brenda Kelly of London Capital Markets explains: It would seem that market participants will have to get used to swings in every direction on equity indices while the market makes up its mind about whether a Fed rate hike would be positive or not. Probability of a move next week has now fallen to 28%. She also predicts that Ian McCafferty will be the only BoE policymaker to vote to raise UK interest rates this month: No change is expected in terms of the rate but the voting structure will still be watched. Expected to be 8-1, any hawkish change to this will likely see UK house builders under pressure. Given the dearth of inflation and yesterday\u2019s horrific industrial and manufacturing data and the headwinds from China. It would certainly be a big surprise to the markets if any major swings in the votes are evident. In the currency markets, the New Zealand dollar has taken a tumble after the country\u2019s central bank cut interest rates. The Kiwi dropped 2% against the US dollar at $0.6275, and is down 1.6% against the pound at around 41p. Not great news for All Black fans ahead of the Rugby World Cup, which begins in England later this month. Peter Cameron, associate fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management, reckons that the case for raising UK interest rates is \u201cflimsy\u201d. The UK\u2019s exports are already struggling against the strength of Sterling, a problem that would be exacerbated by a rate rise. Hawks may point to wage growth finally showing signs of life but even this trend slipped into reverse last month and could slow further if the outlook for the global economy darkens. Cameron also suggests the BoE could consider raising borrowing cost by just 0.1 percentage points, rather than a quarter-point, to avoid scaring the markets. Last month, only one Bank of England policymaker (Ian McCafferty) voted to raise interest rates. Yann Quelenn, market analyst at Swiss online bank Swissbank, reckons other MPC members will sit tight again: \u201cIt is likely that the Bank of England will leave its rate unchanged today. We believe that policymakers are not only considering domestic conditions but also global conditions. Markets are currently driven by the next U.S. Fed rate hike, China\u2019s current turmoil and lingering low oil prices. China\u2019s stock market has closed in the red, after premier Li Keqiang warned that the country\u2019s economy was vulnerable to global shocks. The Shanghai Composite index ended the day down 1.45%, ending a two-day rally. Investors\u2019 nerves were rattled by the news that manufacturers had cut prices at the fastest rate in six years in August, showing rising deflationary pressure. They also heard premier Li admit that the economy is facing tricky times, as Reuters reports: Li acknowledged that the economy had \u201ccome under quite a number of difficulties and downward pressure\u201d while stressing it remained in a \u201cproper range\u201d, a favourite phrase. But he admitted that \u201cdeep-seated problems\u201d were being exposed. \u201cChina is an economy that is closely integrated with the international market,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the weak growth of the global economy, China cannot stay unaffected and the deep-seated problems that have built up over the years are also being exposed.\u201d It\u2019s a bad morning for workers at supermarket chain Morrisons, as my colleague Graham Ruddick explains: Around 900 jobs are at risk at Morrisons after the grocery retailer announced it plans to close 11 supermarkets. David Potts, the new chief executive, has proposed shutting the supermarkets as part of a drive to turnaround the struggling company. The closures were announced as Morrisons reported that pre-tax profits fell by almost half from \u00a3239m to \u00a3126m in the six months to 2 August. High street retailer Next is coping pretty well with the economic conditions. Shares in Next have jumped around 2% to the top of the FTSE 100 leader board, after it posted a 7.1% jump in profits thanks to selling more products at full price. The company, run by Conservative peer Simon Wolfson, has also calculated that Britain\u2019s new \u2018national living wage\u2019 will cost it \u00a327m per year. Of this, \u00a311m relates to the wages of those who will be paid the Living Wage Premium (LWP). The remaining \u00a316m is the knock-on effect of maintaining wage differentials for supervisors, junior managers and other more skilled or demanding roles within the business (such as specialist call centre work). Next expects to raise prices by 1% to compensate for this cost, plus an extra 5% to cover general wage inflation. It also suggests that wages across the sector could be driven up by the LWP. After years of steady success, things aren\u2019t looking quite so good at John Lewis as it reports a 26% fall in pre-tax profit today. Group chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield has admitted that trading conditions were tough for John Lewis\u2019s deparment stores and Waitrose supermarkets, where sales fell for the first time in seven years. UK business chiefs have urged the Bank of England to leave borrowing costs unchanged at today\u2019s meeting, and at every gathering until the middle of 2016. The British Chambers of Commerce argues that the economy could be shunted by problems overseas in the months ahead, and needs the cushion of low borrowing costs. BCC chief economist David Kerr says: \u201cGlobal uncertainty \u2013 including the current situation in China, weakness in the eurozone, and the widely expected rise in US interest rates \u2013 could trigger further bumps in the road. Factors outside our own control reinforce the case for the Bank of England to keep interest rates on hold until well into 2016.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: Trading is under way in Europe, and the main stock markets are all dropping. The FTSE 100 has lost 59 points, or almost 1%, to 6175. Mining stocks are leading the falls, reflecting today\u2019s worries about Chinese deflation. BHP Billiton shares are down 5%, and Glencore has lost 2.4%. Overnight, Brazil was stripped of its investment grade credit rating, as the country\u2019s political and economic problems deepen. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s downgraded Brazil to BB-plus, the highest junk rating. S&amp;P blamed political uncertainty and the country\u2019s deteriorating fiscal position for the downgrade. It\u2019s another headache for president Dilma Rousseff, whose approval ratings have already hit record lows. Brazil was also struggling to deal with high inflation and a weakening economy, plus the impact of falling commodity prices on its mining and energy firms. Stock markets in Asia have dropped back today, amid fresh fears of Chinese deflation. The prices charged by China\u2019s manufacturers fell by 5.9% in August, compared to a year earlier, a new survey showed. That\u2019s the biggest fall since late 2009. It indicates that demand is falling, in the face of a slowing Chinese economy. Li Huiyong, economist at Shenyin &amp; Wanguo Securities, explains that it could have a serious knock-on effect \u201cThe change in the producer prices index is very worrying. It could affect corporate profitability, which in turn could affect consumption and the economy,\u201d Reuters has more details: China deflation fears grow as producer prices sink most in six years The data hit markets across the region. Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 2.5%, as traders were brought back to earth after Wednesday\u2019s 7.7% surge. China\u2019s market is also down in late trading: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll find out how worried the Bank of England is about the state of of the world economy, and the situation here in the UK. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee are meeting in the City today, and will announce their decisions on interest rates at noon. We\u2019re not expecting any change to borrowing costs. The Bank will also release the minutes of the meeting, revealing how MPC members voted. This will also reveal the Bank\u2019s view on inflation prospects, the slowdown in the emerging economies, and the recent market turmoil. Rob Gardner, CEO of investment advisor Redington, predicts that the Bank of England will be pretty cautious, and vote 8-1 to leave interest rates at their record lows. \u201cGiven this gloomy outlook, it is unlikely we are to see any more hawks perch on the committee with Ian McCafferty expected to remain the only dissenting voice in favour of a hike. Indeed, it is more likely that the committee will throw cold water over any imminent rate rise.\u201d Another topsy turvy day looms in the financial markets. After yesterday\u2019s rally, European stock markets are expected to fall back today after a weak finish on Wall Street. Fears over China\u2019s economy are rife again, after new data showed that manufacturers slashed prices at the fastest rate in six years in August. There\u2019s also a flurry of financial results from Britain\u2019s major retailers today. My colleague Graham Ruddick is digging through them - and the early signs aren\u2019t great, with profits down at both supermarket chain Morrisons, and John Lewis, owner of Waitrose (and those department stores). And while Next has posted a 7% rise in profits, Home Retail has reported a drop in sales at its Argos chain. Not great signs for the state of the UK economy. More on all those later, along with all the main developments through the day....",

      "bodyText": "The John Lewis Partnership has suffered a sharp fall in profits blamed on the supermarket price war, higher pension costs and redundancy payments to staff in distribution centres. JLP, which owns the John Lewis department store chain and Waitrose supermarkets, reported a 26% fall in pretax profits before one-off items to \u00a396m in the six months to 1 August. JLP has been hit by a 1.3% fall in like-for-like sales for Waitrose \u2013 its first drop in seven years \u2013 and putting aside \u00a34m for redundancy payments. More than 250 jobs are at risk at John Lewis as it closes three distribution centres in Milton Keynes, one in Stevenage, and one in Carlisle, Cumbria. The staff at the depots have been offered jobs elsewhere in JLP, but the group has booked potential redundancy costs as a restructuring charge in its accounts. The retailer also warned in its results that pension costs have ballooned by \u00a360m as it battles to manage a \u00a31.2bn pension deficit. Sir Charlie Mayfield, JLP\u2019s chairman, said it was a difficult market for John Lewis and Waitrose but called the performance solid. The retailer\u2019s revenue rose 1.9%, with like-for-like sales rising 3% for John Lewis as a 17.1% increase in online sales offset a 1.8% drop in sales completed in stores. Waitrose sales were dragged down by the grocer investing in price cuts, with sales volumes growing 1.8% thanks to the number of customer transactions increasing by 280,000 a week on average compared with last year. Despite Waitrose suffering a fall in like-for-like sales, its operating profits rose by 0.6% to \u00a3136m. This means its profits are now larger than Morrisons, despite the FTSE 100 company generating almost three times more in sales than Waitrose. \u201cWe are pleased with the trajectory we are on,\u201d said Mark Price, managing director of Waitrose sales. \u201cWe want to move on from where we are, but in this market that won\u2019t be easy.\u201d Andy Street, the managing director of John Lewis, said the performance of the department store chain was \u201cstable\u201d. Clothing sales rose 7.5% and home sales 4.9%, but electrical sales dropped 0.7%. Street said the year-on-year comparison of John Lewis sales had been distorted by a boost in sales last summer from the football World Cup and the retailer\u2019s 150th anniversary celebrations. The general election also weighed on the sale of big-ticket items in the runup to May. John Lewis reported a 16.3% fall in operating profits to \u00a347.1m, with the redundancy charges, increased holiday pay and rising costs impacting the chain. JLP operates 44 John Lewis and 340 Waitrose stores, and employs almost 90,000 staff. Despite the pressure on the retailer, pretax profits at a statutory level grew 73% to \u00a3224m, thanks to the sale of a distribution centre in west London, which raised \u00a3128m. Mayfield said that trading conditions would remain difficult and that there was little sign of any price inflation in the grocery market as supermarkets cut prices. \u201cHowever, I expect sales in both Waitrose and John Lewis to perform comparatively well against the market, helped by promising new ranges and online capability,\u201d he said. Nonetheless, JLP\u2019s pretax profits for the full year are expected to fall from \u00a3342.7m to between \u00a3270m and \u00a3320m, according to Mayfield, meaning the retailer\u2019s staff face a drop in their annual bonus. Mayfield, the president of British Retail Consortium and a government adviser, said the chancellor\u2019s national living wage will have a \u201cvery modest\u201d impact on JLP given most of its staff earn more than the new \u00a37.20 per hour minimum rate that will be introduced for workers aged 25 and over. However, he said it could lead to price rises and job losses across the retail industry. \u201cDifferent organisations will respond in different ways,\u201d Mayfield said. Under the chancellor\u2019s plans, the minimum wage for over-25s will rise from \u00a36.50 an hour at present to \u00a37.20 in April next year, before rising to at least \u00a39 by 2020. \u201cIt is sort of helpful because it gives us a clear direction over time,\u201d Mayfield added.",

Instead, it could be the result of thousands of small donations funneled to a tiny company, and built from the ground up through a powerful crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. Increasingly, small companies and individual entrepreneurs with limited funds and big ideas are using the site to create innovative products that consumers want, leaving technology giants like Apple and Google to play catch up. The Pebble Time smartwatch is a good example: earlier this year, it became the most funded Kickstarter campaign in history by raising $20.3m. An earlier iteration of the watch also broke Kickstarter records, raising $10.3m in 2012. Pebble was a game changer. With a long battery life, music controls that sync with a user\u2019s smartphone, and the ability to work with both Android and IOS systems, it demonstrated that there was a market for a multifunctional watch. Not long after its first version was released in 2013, big technology companies scrambled to get a piece of the pie. Samsung released Android Wear in 2014, and Apple came out with its much-hyped watch a year later.

      "bodyText": "Bank of England policymakers have offered a reassuring verdict on the impact of China\u2019s market meltdown, insisting that while it would \u201cadd to the global headwinds\u201d facing the UK, their plans to raise interest rates remained on track. One member of the Bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee, former CBI economist Ian McCafferty, voted for an immediate increase in borrowing costs from their record low of 0.5% at the meeting that concluded on Wednesday \u2013 the same voting pattern as in August. But the minutes of the meeting offered the first insight into how UK policymakers are weighing the potential costs of China\u2019s downturn. Events in China, where crashing share prices and a devaluation of the yuan unleashed shockwaves across global financial markets in August, were \u201cthe main focus of the committee\u2019s decision\u201d, the minutes showed. \u201cThese developments have the potential to add to the global headwinds to UK growth and inflation,\u201d the MPC members said. However, balancing the risks for the UK from a Chinese downturn against robust domestic demand, the MPC concluded there was not yet any reason to question the relatively upbeat forecasts in last month\u2019s quarterly inflation report, though the Bank\u2019s economists now expect growth of 0.6%, instead of 0.7%, in the coming quarter. \u201cGlobal developments do not as yet appear sufficient to alter materially the central outlook described in the August Report, but the greater downside risks to the global environment merit close monitoring for any impact on domestic economic activity,\u201d the minutes said. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has made clear he believes interest rates could start rising around \u201cthe turn of the year\u201d, but they will increase more slowly and to a lower level than in previous years. He used his recent speech at the annual gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to play down the impact of China\u2019s woes on UK policy. At home, the MPC said, \u201cdomestic momentum is being underpinned by robust real income growth, supportive credit conditions, and elevated business and consumer confidence\u201d. Despite inflation running at just 0.1% against the Bank\u2019s target of 2% \u2013 and expected to dip below zero again in the coming months \u2013 some MPC members saw \u201ccontinued upside risks to inflation relative to the target\u201d. Sterling rallied modestly, jumping by about half a cent against the dollar, after the minutes were published, as the markets digested the MPC\u2019s relatively relaxed approach to August\u2019s tumultuous trading. \u201cThe MPC seems a bit more sanguine about the recent volatility in financial markets and slowdown in [emerging markets] than the market had perhaps expected,\u201d said Elizabeth Martins, an economist at HSBC. However, she warned that the deteriorating outlook for emerging markets could yet force the Bank to delay raising rates. \u201cWhile the MPC\u2019s assessment is upbeat for now, further disappointing data over the coming weeks could make them more cautious.\u201d MPC members appeared to be divided about how to read the growing signs of a slowdown in the labour market, after the latest official figures showed faltering employment growth. \u201cOn one view, the slowing employment data might imply that labour demand had plateaued, and that this would keep pay growth muted,\u201d the minutes said. \u201cOn another view, however, the slowdown in employment might reflect greater hiring difficulties, consistent with survey evidence of skills shortages.\u201d Thursday\u2019s minutes also repeat the formula that Carney\u2019s guidance about the future pace of interest rate rises is \u201can expectation, not a promise\u201d. Markets expect interest rates to increase in early 2016; but Vicky Redwood, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said the MPC was unlikely to be in any hurry. \u201cThe economic recovery in the UK appears to have faltered (albeit temporarily in our view), the labour market has weakened and a return to deflation in the next few months is likely. What\u2019s more, there have been positive signs that productivity is picking up, which will keep unit wage costs and inflation subdued further ahead,\u201d she said. The governor will appear before MPs on the cross-party Treasury select committee next week to set out his expectations for the economy, alongside MPC members Martin Weale, Kristin Forbes and Ian McCafferty.",

He used <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/29/bank-of-england-inflation-china-economy\">his recent speech at the annual gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming</a>, to play down the impact of China\u2019s woes on UK policy.</p> <p>At home, the MPC said, \u201cdomestic momentum is being underpinned by robust real income growth, supportive credit conditions, and elevated business and consumer confidence\u201d.</p> <p>Despite inflation running at just 0.1% against the Bank\u2019s target of 2% \u2013 and expected to dip below zero again in the coming months \u2013 some MPC members saw \u201ccontinued upside risks to inflation relative to the target\u201d.</p> <p>Sterling rallied modestly, jumping by about half a cent against the dollar, after the minutes were published, as the markets digested the MPC\u2019s relatively relaxed approach to August\u2019s tumultuous trading.</p> <p>\u201cThe MPC seems a bit more sanguine about the recent volatility in financial markets and slowdown in [emerging markets] than the market had perhaps expected,\u201d said Elizabeth Martins, an economist at HSBC.</p> <p>However, she warned that the deteriorating outlook for emerging markets could yet force the Bank to delay raising rates. \u201cWhile the MPC\u2019s assessment is upbeat for now, further disappointing data over the coming weeks could make them more cautious.\u201d</p> <p>MPC members appeared to be divided about how to read the growing signs of a slowdown in the labour market, after the latest official figures showed faltering employment growth. \u201cOn one view, the slowing employment data might imply that labour demand had plateaued, and that this would keep pay growth muted,\u201d the minutes said. \u201cOn another view, however, the slowdown in employment might reflect greater hiring difficulties, consistent with survey evidence of skills shortages.\u201d</p> <p>Thursday\u2019s minutes also repeat the formula that Carney\u2019s guidance about the future pace of interest rate rises is \u201can expectation, not a promise\u201d. </p> <p>Markets expect interest rates to increase in early 2016; but Vicky Redwood, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said the MPC was unlikely to be in any hurry. \u201cThe economic recovery in the UK appears to have faltered (albeit temporarily in our view), the labour market has weakened and a return to deflation in the next few months is likely. What\u2019s more, there have been positive signs that productivity is picking up, which will keep unit wage costs and inflation subdued further ahead,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The governor will appear before MPs on the cross-party Treasury select committee next week to set out his expectations for the economy, alongside MPC members Martin Weale, Kristin Forbes and Ian McCafferty.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The latest figures for Australian household incomes and wealth released last week showed that income inequality has risen in the past two years. The average annual income of the richest 20% rose by 7%, while median households saw their income rise by just 1.3% in the same period. Politicians love to justify economic policy by referring to \u201cmiddle Australians\u201d or the average household. So Australia\u2019s median income is important. But deciding who is wealthy and who\u2019s an average battler generally comes down to whether the politicians are being generous or making cuts. For example Tony Abbott, when defending his childcare subsidy earlier this year, suggested that \u201cin a city like Sydney, a $185,000 family income is not especially high\u201d. While there is some good data on household incomes by organisations such as the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, every two years the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases its survey of Household Income and Wealth. The latest release shows that the median gross household income in 2013-14 was $80,704, and the average of all households was $107,276: As you might imagine, these figures are a bit misleading. Yes, if you live in a household that brings in more than $80,704 yours is in the richest 50% of all households, but such figures don\u2019t account for differences in household size. The gross income figures effectively treats a household with a family of five the same as that of a single person. So saying you live in a household that brings in $80,000 doesn\u2019t tell us much. If you are living alone, you\u2019re clearly doing a lot better than another household on the same income that has two adults and three kids. This is why the ABS uses \u201cequivalised\u201d household incomes. This measure allows us to compare households like for like \u2013 by firstly looking at disposable income, which gives a better indication of the income a household has available to meet its needs, and then by allowing for differences of household sizes. The formula adds 50% to an income for each adult and 30% for each child under 15. So, for example a single person earning $1,000 a week would be on the same equivalised income as a household with a single parent with one child who earned $1,300. Using this measure the median annual disposable income for a single person is $43,836 and for a family of two adults and two children it is $92,056: It\u2019s a bit hard to work out what you\u2019d need to earn before tax to hit that median, assuming your income comes via work and not government benefits, which is rarely the case. But for a single person to take home $43,836 after income tax and the Medicare levy has been paid, they\u2019d need to be on about $53,800. For a family of two it is even harder to estimate, given we need to know the split of incomes earned. But assuming a 70/30 split of income (ie one partner earns 70% of the household\u2019s income), one partner would need a job paying $85,900, while the other earned $30,000, for a total pre-tax income of $115,900. Interestingly, the amount at which a household with two kids under 12 stops receiving any Family Tax Benefit A is $109,427 \u2013 thus a level below the median household income. Using the same split, households earning $185,000, far from being \u201cnot especially high\u201d would be in the top 25% of all households. The chart below lets you arrange the figures according to size of household: Not surprisingly, since the GFC the growth of income for all households has slowed compared with during the boom years of 2002-2008. During the GFC years from 2009 to 2012 the wealthiest took the biggest hit to income \u2013 due to their greater reliance on income from sources such as share dividends and also because higher-paying jobs are more subject to fluctuations than are those mandated by awards and minimum wages. But from 2011-12 to 2013-14 the biggest growth in incomes was for the wealthiest. Those in the top 20% saw their household income rise on average by 7% over those two years (3.5% annually) compared with a mere 1.3% growth for median income households in that period: This above-average growth for the richest 20% has effectively undone the reductions in income inequality that were caused by the GFC: The boom years saw Australia\u2019s Gini coefficient (which measures inequality) rise from 0.306 in 2003-04 to 0.336 in 2007-08. The fall in highest incomes saw this drop to 0.32 in 2011-12. But now it is back up to 0.333. Effectively, Australia is now as unequal as it ever has been. The drive in inequality is not so much the rich getting richer while the poor get poorer, as it is the rich getting richer while everyone else stagnates. Low wages growth over the past two years has seen median incomes barely increase. Increases in the minimum wage and the indexation of various pensions mean lower income households have seen their incomes grow by a similar, if pitiable, amount as median households since the GFC. But the picture of inequality over the past 20 years is one of Australia\u2019s welfare system keeping the incomes of the poorest households largely in line with those of median income households. In 1994-95, median households earned around 2.23 times the income of the poorest 20% of households. In 2013-14 it was 2.25 times \u2013 barely any change at all. By comparison, in 1994-95 the average income of richest 20% was 2.13 times that of median households; now it is 2.42 times: The debate of inequality generally rests on whether it is OK for inequality to increase so long as everyone\u2019s incomes rise. The \u201crising tide lifts all boats\u201d argument worked well during the boom, but not any more.",

In 2013-14 it was 2.25 times \u2013 barely any change at all. </p> <p>By comparison, in 1994-95 the average income of richest 20% was 2.13 times that of median households; now it is 2.42 times:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"greg\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LMO2v/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The debate of inequality generally rests on whether it is OK for inequality to increase so long as everyone\u2019s incomes rise.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s businesses are urging the Bank of England to leave interest rates on hold \u201cwell into 2016\u201d, to cushion the economy against global turmoil, as rate-setters prepare to announce the result of their September policy meeting. Publishing its latest quarterly economic forecast, the British Chambers of Commerce has upgraded its expectations of GDP growth but cautions the Bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) against pushing ahead with tightening policy. David Kern, the business body\u2019s chief economist, said he now expects GDP growth of 2.6% this year, up from 2.3% in its last forecast; and 2.7% in 2016, up from 2.6%. He said that would make the UK one of the fastest-growing major economies. However, he urged the MPC to hold its fire. \u201cGlobal uncertainty \u2013 including the current situation in China, weakness in the eurozone, and the widely expected rise in US interest rates \u2013 could trigger further bumps in the road. Factors outside our own control reinforce the case for the Bank of England to keep interest rates on hold until well into 2016.\u201d When the MPC announces its monthly rate decision on Thursday, City experts will seize on any hint that the Chinese economic slowdown could push back plans to raise interest rates. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, recently reiterated his expectation that a rate rise could become necessary around \u201cthe turn of the year\u201d, despite the global market turmoil in recent weeks triggered by fears of a crash in China. However, at its August meeting, just one of the MPC\u2019s nine members, the ex-CBI economist Ian McCafferty, voted for an immediate rate increase, and the Quarterly Inflation Report suggested that inflation, which was 0.1% in July, could dip back below zero in the coming months. The interest rate decision on Thursday will be announced alongside the publication of the meeting\u2019s minutes, as part of the Bank\u2019s new commitment to transparency. Analysts will scour the minutes for any evidence that the Chinese stock market rout, and the roller-coaster ride that prompted the FTSE100 to lose 6% of its value in August, have unnerved policymakers. Interest rates were slashed to their record low of just 0.5% in 2009, at the height of the global financial crisis, but with the economy now growing at a healthy pace, Carney has repeatedly made clear that borrowing costs must rise. However, the most recent official data on Britain\u2019s labour market suggested that the hiring boom has started to wane, with the unemployment rate from April to June higher than three months earlier. Martin Beck, of the consultancy Oxford Economics, said the question marks over the health of the global economy, together with the recent strength of sterling, which could damage the UK\u2019s export performance, meant he now expected a rate rise to be delayed. \u201cAlong with August\u2019s dovish minutes, the enduring strength of sterling and the merits of waiting until the US Federal Reserve has hiked rates (something we now expect to occur in December), recent developments all point to the first post-financial rise in UK interest rates coming later than previously expected. We have pushed our call back from Q1 2016 to Q2.\u201d This week\u2019s meeting will also be the first for the new MPC member Jan Vlieghe, a former hedge fund economist. New recruits tend not to depart from the consensus in their early outings.",
