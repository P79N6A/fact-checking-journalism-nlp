      "bodyText": "The chancellor George Osborne would be forgiven for regretting his bold target of doubling UK exports of goods and services to \u00a31tn by 2020. It sounds good on paper. Britain will recover its past manufacturing glory, with production lines around the country pumping out goods that the swelling middle classes in emerging economies will clamber to get their hands on. There is little argument that a rebalancing of the economy with a lesser reliance on consumer spending and greater emphasis on manufacturing and exports is a worthwhile ambition. But how we are going to get there is less certain. It is unclear who owns the target, who will be responsible for achieving it, and who will be accountable if it is missed: the Treasury, UK Trade &amp; Investment, businesses? The subject is rapidly turning into a political hot potato, with businesses arguing the government should do more in the way of support, and the government claiming companies need to be more ambitious. Neither argument gets us closer to \u00a31tn. Both UKTI and the Treasury admit it is an ambitious target, but are less keen to be drawn on whether they think it is still achievable. It is fair to say that weaker than expected recovery in the eurozone, the UK's largest trading partner, has not helped UK exports in the recent past. But there were always likely to be bumps along the way \u2013 with more to come \u2013 and the target is now looking very optimistic. At home, businesses do not appear to have the appetite to find new export markets, as a report by Lloyds Bank published earlier this week showed. UKTI has said it wants to hear from potential exporters because it is there to help. But the message is not getting across. Almost half (43%) of the mid-sized exporting companies surveyed by Lloyds hadn't even heard of the government department. The broader message from the government appears to be that \"we are all in this together\" on exports, but the national project is lacking clear leadership. 2020 is drawing closer, but rebalancing remains elusive.",

      "bodyText": "Shell has struck a deal to sell some of its onshore oil and gas fields in the Niger delta amid rising concern about oil spills, sabotage and industrial-scale theft from Nigerian wells and pipelines of up to 150,000 barrels a day. Last summer a Shell review raised the possibility of scaling down operations in Nigeria and the company is poised to sell four fields and a pipeline for what some believe could be $5bn (\u00a33bn). Despite the planned disposals, the Anglo-Dutch group still faces legal cases \u2013 including one at the high court in London \u2013 brought by communities seeking compensation for pollution. A company spokesman in London confirmed that an agreement on some oil-mining leases and a pipeline had been reached, but said that the process had not yet concluded. The sale price for four fields and a pipeline was estimated at $5.2bn (\u00a33.1bn) by two anonymous sources quoted by the Financial Times, but analysts have previously presumed the figure would be nearer $3bn. Iain Reid, a London-based oil analyst at Bank of Montreal, said Ben van Beurden, Shell's chief executive, would please investors if he could sell some of the delta fields that have been hit by theft and disruption for the higher figure: \"If Shell can achieve this sort of price for these assets it will have achieved three objectives: firstly, reduced its exposure to troublesome onshore Nigeria; second, cut its net capital expenditure spend; and third, increased the free cash it can spend on share buybacks and dividends, all of which we believe the market will like.\" Shell has a 30% stake in the assets because it shares the ownership of the assets with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Total of France and ENI of Italy. The company, which says it has done its best to clear up pollution and has blamed oil spills on sabotage, has been trying to reduce its commitment to the troubled region for years but has only recently found local buyers willing to pay the prices it has demanded. This is partly because the government has offered tax concessions to a crop of local oil companies such as Oando and Shoreline Natural Resources, which has encouraged them to bid to take control of fields in the Niger delta. Van Beurden, who issued a profit warning within days of taking the top job in January, promised to improve the financial performance of the business through asset sales and cutbacks. He has already taken enormous financial writedowns on a string of assets and disposed of fields and other assets in North America and Australia. Fields in the North Sea are also up for sale. Shell has yet to abandon other controversial commitments, such as the plan to drill in the Arctic and its interests in Canada's tar sands, but it has generally moved its emphasis away from oil towards the cleaner fuel of gas. Nigeria has produced almost a quarter of a million barrels of oil equivalent a day for Shell and at least 80,000 barrels a day would be lost if the four fields are sold. A spokesman for the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria said it would make a formal market announcement when it had completed the sales process. But the oil company stressed that it was not abandoning the country. \"Nigeria remains an important part of Shell's portfolio, where we will continue to have a significant onshore presence in oil and gas, and which has clear growth potential, particularly in deep-water and onshore gas. Shell has a history of over 50 years in Nigeria and remains committed to the country and to supporting the government of Nigeria in their plans for the oil and gas sector.\"",

      "bodyText": "After recent gains, stock markets were a little more hesistant, not helped by underwhelming share volumes again thanks to the continuing summer lull. After struggling for direction the UK market finally finished slightly higher (details here) but with uncertainty over whether the ECB was about to introduce further stimulus measures next week to boost the eurozone economy, other markets were more mixed. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 7.9 points or 0.12% at 6830.66 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.19% to 9569.71 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.04% at 4395.26 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB edge up 0.57% to 20,763.14 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.1% higher at 10,837.4 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up nearly 12 points or 0.07% while the S&amp;P 500 is holding fairly steady above the 2000 level. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. In the wake of the weekend\u2019s collapse of the French government amid a rift over austerity measures, and the formation of a new cabinet on Monday, comes more evidence of the pain felt by the country\u2019s economy. The number of people out of work in France rose to another record in July, up by 26,100 or 0.8% over the month to 3,424,400. The yearly rise was 4.3%. Over in Greece prime minister Antonis Samaras is about to hold talks with senior government ministers in a bid to fine-tune strategy ahead of the relaunch of negotiations with troika mission chiefs in Paris next week. From Athens, our correspondent Helena Smith reports: It\u2019s back to business as usual with the Greek government hunkering down in preparation of next week\u2019s crucial talks with mission heads representing [lenders] the EU, ECB and IMF in Paris. Samaras will meet his deputy, the socialist leader Evangelos Venizelos and other senior government ministers for what coalition leaders hope will be a final session of \u2018strategising\u2019 ahead of the new round of talks next Tuesday. The stakes are high and the trade-offs potentially enormous. \u201cWe want everything to go smoothly which, as you know, is why this time the talks will take place in a neutral setting,\u201d said one government insider referring to the decision to relaunch negotiations in the French capital. \u201cWe\u2019re fine-tuning details.\u201d The Greek government has made no secret of the fact that it hopes creditors will finally embark on serious discussions to scale back the country\u2019s monumental debt load \u2013 at nearly 175% of Gross National Product by far the largest in the EU \u2013 once the current review of the economy is over. But much will depend on whether lenders are convinced of the progress Athens has made in plugging fiscal holes and enforcing structural reforms. Greece has yet to lay off 6,500 civil servants \u2013 essential, troika officials say, to streamlining a public sector widely seen as the root of so many of the country\u2019s financial woes. The Greek finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis has been cited in the local media as saying he hopes the troika \u201cwill feel sorry\u201d for Greece after eating so much austerity pie \u2013 the Greek economy had contracted by more than 25%, with most seeing their disposable incomes drop precipitously since the eruption of the debt crisis in late 2009. Foreign lenders have not ruled out Greece needing a third bailout \u2013 something the government is keen to avoid. Samaras is believed to have said as much when he held talks with the former finance minister of France Pierre Moscovici, who is widely touted to replace Olli Rehn as Economic and Monetary affairs commissioner, earlier today. Despite expectations the ECB is close to introducing new stimulus measures to boost the eurozone economy, it may not happen at next week\u2019s meeting after all. According to a Reuters report the ECB is unlikely to take action next week unless August inflation figures, due on Friday, show the eurozone moving significantly closer to deflation. The Reuter\u2019s report quoted a source saying \u201cThe barrier to QE is still high\u201d and suggesting the discussion at the ECB\u2019s meeting was likely to centre on reforming existing policy measures of credit easing and liquidity provision. The source added: \u201cIt\u2019s hare to say now that nothing will happen. It depends to some extent on the data.\u201d Wall Street has opened and, in common with the European markets, it seems uncertain which way to go after its record breaking gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is virtually flat (down 3.85 points to be precise) while the S&amp;P 500 has edged up 0.46 points. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has dipped 3.54 points after early attempts to edge higher, while Germany\u2019s Dax is down 2.12 points while France\u2019s CAC is up 2.92 points. It looks like the European Central Bank is indeed readying itself for further measures to stimulate the flagging eurozone economy, as its president Mario Draghi suggested in the US on Friday. According to a report on Bloomberg, the ECB has appointed investment manager BlackRock to advise on developing a program to buy asset-backed securities: BlackRock Solutions, a unit of the New York-based company, will provide advice on the design and implementation of a potential ABS-purchase plan, an ECB spokesman said in response to e-mailed questions. Safeguards against any conflict of interest are included in the agreement, the spokesman said. ECB President Mario Draghi said in June that the central bank is intensifying preparations to purchase ABS as it strives to revive the faltering euro-area economy. While the effort could help revitalize a $1.9 trillion market that has contracted 34 percent since 2009, and at the same time inject liquidity into the financial system, officials have yet to agree on what such a program should look like. BlackRock\u2019s contract requires it to ensure effective separation between the project team working for the ECB and its staff involved in any other ABS-related activities, the spokesman said. The final decision on the design and implementation of any ABS-purchase program will be taken by the ECB\u2019s Governing Council, and the execution will remain the responsibility of the central bank, the spokesman said. Meanwhile French prime minister Manuel Valls has added his voice to demands for the ECB to act: With the French government collapsing over the weekend after a rift over austerity measures, leading to a new cabinet announced yesterday, the debate over cutbacks and spending is back in the spotlight. So what to make of this: To recap... Christine Lagarde\u2019s position as the head of the International Monetary Fund is under scrutiny today after magistrates put her under formal investigation, over the Bernard Tapie fraud inquiry. Lagarde has insisted that she will not resign, and will fly to Washington to brief the IMF board. She told AFP: \u201cI have instructed my lawyer to appeal this decision which I consider totally without merit. \u201cI return back to Washington where I will indeed brief my board.\u201d Lagarde\u2019s lawyer, Yves Repiquet, has told reporters that the charge is a \u2018minor\u2019 one, but carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a fine of \u20ac15,000 if convicted. Full story: Christine Lagarde to be investigated for alleged role in political fraud case Elsewhere... There are new concerns over the strength of the eurozone economy, after a stream of disappointing economic news. German consumer confidence has been hit by the escalating tensions with Russia, the unrest in Iraq, and the conflict between Israel and Gaza. Economic expectations have tumbled at their fastest rate in at least 30 years, with pollsters warning that the economy has shifted down by a couple of gears. Italian consumer confidence has also fallen, with citizens more gloomy about its prospects. Matteo Renzi\u2019s government is expected to cut its growth forecasts soon, according to its economy minister. And industrial confidence in France has dipped, a reminder of the challenges facing Francois Hollande\u2019s new government. The news helped to drive the yields on eurozone government bonds down to new lows, as investors anticipate weak growth, low inflation, and perhaps a QE programme from the European Central Bank. In the UK.... Royal Bank of Scotland has been fined \u00a315m for failing to give mortgage customers decent advice. Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, dubbed the findings \u201cshocking and disappointing\u201d. Tesco\u2019s market share has fallen again, as price wars continue to hurt Britain\u2019s supermarkets (good news for consumers though!). Estate chain Foxtons has warned that London house price growth is easing. And talk of a possible takeover bid for ASOS has driven its shares up 15% today. My colleague Nick Fletcher will be along shortly to cover the afternoon\u2019s developments. Cheers. GW Another photo from Paris, of Christine Lagarde speaking to her lawyer, Yves Repiquet, today. So, how serious is a charge of negligence? The Financial Times says it could potentially lead to a prison term (we\u2019re a long way from that at this stage, though) From Paris, Hugh Carnegy reports: Ms Lagarde\u2019s spokesman told the FT that the charge was relatively minor but one that nevertheless carried a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a fine of \u20ac15,000 if convicted. The AFP news agency has confirmed that Christine Lagarde has no plans to resign. From the wires: The investigating commission of the court of justice of the French Republic has decided to place me under formal investigation,\u201d she said in exclusive comments to AFP. In France, being placed under formal investigation is the nearest equivalent to being charged, and happens when an examining magistrate has decided there is a case to be answered. It does not, however, always lead to a formal charge. \u201cI have instructed my lawyer to appeal this decision which I consider totally without merit. \u201cI return back to Washington where I will indeed brief my board.\u201d Asked whether she intended to resign from the IMF, she responded: \u201cNo.\u201d Lagarde\u2019s lawyer, Yves Repiquet, has told Reuters that the IMF chief believes the decision to formally investigate her for negligence over the Bernard Tapie case was unfounded: \u201cWe are appealing it,\u201d Repiquet said by telephone, adding that Lagarde, who was due to return to IMF headquarters in Washington later on Wednesday, had no plans to resign. Reuters also explains how several members of Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s cabinet are ensnared in the Tapie payout probe. The list includes former Lagarde aide Stephane Richard, who is now FranceTelecom CEO. In previous rounds of questioning, Lagarde accused Richard of having used her pre-printed signature to sign off on a document facilitating the payment, local media has said. However Richard has stated that Lagarde was fully briefed on the matter. Christine Lagarde has been questioned for 15 hours yesterday by the Court of Justice of the Republic over her involvement in the Bernard Tapie case, flags up City AM. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, has been placed under formal investigation by French magistrates who are investigating a political fraud case that has gripped the nation. Lagarde, the former French finance minister, announced the development this morning, and insisted that the decision to investigate her for negligence was unfounded. She has no intention to resign, and plans to return to her work at the IMF in Washington later today. Lagarde has been questioned by magistrates on several occasions, and her flat was searched in March 2013. The case centres on French tycoon Bernard Tapie, who was a close friend of former president Nicolas Sarkozy. Back in 2008, Tapie was awarded more than \u20ac400m from the French state after claiming negligence against Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnaise for selling German sportswear brand Adidas too cheaply (the FT has a good backgrounder here). Critics say the deal was too generous, and an example of the cosy relations between Sarkozy\u2019s administration and business. As finance minister, Lagarde set up the arbitration panel that decided the payout. Britain\u2019s supermarkets remain locked in a toe-to-toe price war, meaning prices are rising at their lowest rate since at least October 2006. Grocery price inflation fell for the eleventh consecutive quarter to just 0.2%, according to the latest figures from Kantar Worldpanel. And several big names lost ground again, as my colleague Sarah Butler reports: The battle to cut prices on staple items such as vegetables, milk and bread all drove down inflation over the summer. Of the UK\u2019s biggest six supermarkets, only Asda and Waitrose managed to increase their share of the market in that tough environment while Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s and The Co-op all lost ground. Tesco was the biggest loser as sales fell 4% in the 12 weeks to 17 August driving it down to a market share of 28.8% more than 1 percentage point less than a year before. The figures mark out the scale of the challenge for incoming chief executive Dave Lewis who takes charge of turning around the UK\u2019s largest retailer in October. In the City, speculation that a US e-commerce giant could snap up British online fashion success ASOS has sent its shares up 15% this morning, having gained 7% yesterday. More in Nick Fletcher\u2019s market report, along with all the key moves this morning: FTSE pauses for breath but Asos jumps on US takeover speculation Italian consumers, like their German counterparts, have suffered a drop in confidence this month. But their worries are mainly domestic based, as they watch the Italian economy slide back into recession. The monthly confidence climate index calculated by ISTAT fell sharply to its lowest level since March, down from 104.4 to 101.9. Consumers said they were less optimistic about the state of the economy, their personal situation, current economic conditions, and future prospects. The steepest decline was seen in sentiment on the country\u2019s economic situation.The survey showed Italians expected unemployment to continue to rise and saw no pick-up in consumer prices. Shorter-term German bond yields are now in negative territory, meaning investors are actually paying for the chance to own one, two, and three-year bunds. The tumble in eurozone bond yields is a clear signal that investors expect the eurozone to become bogged down in a low-growth, deflationary spiral, repeating Japan\u2019s experience over the last two decades. The yield, or interest rate, on German 10-year bonds has hit a new record low this morning. Strong demand for German 10-year bunds has pushed their price to new highs, meaning they are now yielding just 0.917% this morning. Other eurozone bonds area also rallying. There is anticipation that the European Central Bank will announce fresh stimulus measures soon. Today\u2019s drop in German consumer confidence adds to the pressure on the ECB. DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz explains: \u201cWhen the EMU\u2019s largest economy is falling behind, this is very much increasing the chances of the ECB heading for further monetary measures, above all QE.\u201d Foxtons, the London estate agent famous for pushy sales tactics and garish Minis, has sounded a cautious note on the housing market. Shares in Foxtons have fallen 6% this morning, even though it announced a special interim dividend and a 57% jump in pre-tax profits for the first half of the year. And that\u2019s because the company has flagged up that new affordability tests are starting to cool the London housing sector, after a \u201cstrong\u201d start to the year. Foxton\u2019s told shareholders that: The range of policy initiatives introduced in 2014 aimed at controlling mortgage lending, together with the expectation of early increases in interest rates, is now having an impact on short term demand among buyers. Consistent with others in the sector, we expect this to lead to lower rates of market growth in both property sales transactions and prices during the second half of the year. Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, says he\u2019s shocked by the poor sales practices exposed at RBS and NatWest today. He\u2019s also alarmed that it too so long to address them. Budget airline Ryanair has taken another step towards scrubbing up its image, launching a new business class service today. Features include \u201c flexible tickets, more check-in baggage, priority boarding and \u2018premium\u2019 seats\u201d, as it tries to lure more executives onboard. However, it\u2019s a rather trimmed-down business class -- people get larger seats, or be separated from the rest of the plane. Full story: Ryanair launches business class flights Britain\u2019s banking sector continues to demonstrate a remarkable inability to treat its customers properly. Today\u2019s culprit is Royal Bank of Scotland, which has been fined \u00a314.5m for failing to offer decent advice to mortgage customers. Britain\u2019s financial watchdog, the FCA, said RBS and NatWest salespeople often provided poor advice: Only 2 of the 164 sales reviewed were considered to meet the standard required overall in a sales process. In the firms\u2019 own mystery shopping there were examples of advisers giving personal views on the future movement of interest rates. This was highly inappropriate and may have resulted in the borrower being sold the wrong type of mortgage for them. More here: RBS fined \u00a314.5m over mortgage advice RBS has already agreed that it failed to give customers the best service, and says it has retrained staff to avoid a repeat. German consumer confidence had been steadily rising over the last 18 months until today\u2019s drop (see 8.00am for details), as this tweet shows: So is it just a blip, or the start of something serious? It may all depend on whether tensions in Russia and the Middle East decline, or deteriorate further. As GfK explains: Major upheavals in the global economy have so far only affected the consumer mood in Germany to a very limited extent. In order to ensure that this remains the case for consumers in future, it is important that the situations in the crisis regions do not escalate further and that long-term solutions are found instead. However, if domestic framework conditions also deteriorate decisively as a result of any potential further escalation, it is probable that more difficult times will also lie ahead for the German economy. Italy\u2019s economy minister has predicted that it could lower its growth forecasts \u2013 making it a hat-trick of bad news for the eurozone this morning The Italian governent currently predicts that GDP will rise by 0.8% this year, but that was before Italy fell back into recession. A rethink is now needed. Pier Carlo Padoan told the Corriere della Sera newspaper that: \u201cWe must revise the GDP (gross domestic product) growth forecast to the downside.\u201d Reuters reckons that could bring the government into line with most economists who expect little or no growth for the euro zone\u2019s third-largest economy this year. Bad news from France too -- morale among French companies has fallen again. Statistics body INSEE reports that the industry morale dipped again in August, to 96 from 97 on its monthly survey (where 100 is the long-term average). Worryingly, production expectations remain low - suggesting French producers see little sign that fortunes will pick up soon. Order books, and export orders, look weak too, particularly among manufacturers of electrical and electronic equipment, machinery, and transport. German consumer confidence has suffered its first fall since January 2013, as the weakening eurozone economy and geopolitical risks hit Europe\u2019s largest economy. The forward-looking survey of German morale, by polling firm GfK, found that economic expectations have \u2018collapsed\u2019 this month, as the wider consumer climate suffers a setback. Uncertainty over the German economy has risen, after it shrank in the second quarter of this year. And the deteriorating situation in Iraq, Israel and Eastern Ukraine and the \u201cgradually accelerating spiral of sanctions\u201d against Russia have also forced Germans to reevaluate their previously extremely optimistic economic outlook. That has sent economic expectations tumbling, in the biggest slump since the survey began 34 years ago. As GfK puts it: \u201cConsumers are increasingly taking the intensified geopolitical situation into consideration in their assessment of how the German economy will develop over the coming months. The indicator dropped by 35.5 points, plummeting to 10.4 points. A decline of this magnitude in just one month has not been recorded since the survey began in 1980. Consequently, virtually all improvement in the economic expectations indicator over the past year has been negated in one fell swoop. In August 2013, the indicator value was 1.8 points. Given Germany\u2019s close trade links with Russia, the Ukraine crisis is seen as a major threat. GfK says: Consumers are expecting the economy to shift down a gear or two at least. Given that no long-term solutions appear to be on the cards yet for any of the crises, uncertainty is rising in the population on the potential consequences for the German economy. In particular, the sanctions against Russia, which are already significantly impacting exports, could become a real risk for the German economy. As this tweet shows, consumer morale had been rising in Germany for the last year. Not any more... The \u2018Income expectations\u2019 and \u2018willingness to buy\u2019 have both fallen; a blow to hopes that free-spending German consumers could drag the eurozone economy through its current malaise. The full report is here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy. Coming up today -- a new survey of German consumers has found that confidence has been hit by economic weakness in the eurozone, and geopolitical threats across the globe. Royal Bank of Scotland is being fined almost \u00a315m for failing to offer decent mortgage advice to customers (the news broke last night). In the City, upmarket estate agent Foxtons has is reporting strong sales as the housing boom filters through to its pockets. And Ryanair has launched its business class service. While European stock markets are expected to dip a little after a couple of days of decent gains, fuelled by strong economic data in the US and the prospect of more monetary stimulus in Europe. All this, and more, coming up....",

Even the FCA admits that the consumer detriment from these failings was limited.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair has launched a business service in the airline's latest move to revamp its image and catch up with travellers' demands for better treatment. The airline said its \"business plus\" fares would give customers flexible tickets, more check-in baggage, priority boarding and \"premium\" seats \u2013 in the first five rows for quick boarding, or on exit rows with extra legroom. It said business passengers already make up more than a quarter of its customers and that the new fares, starting at \u20ac69.99 (or \u00a359.99 for UK customers), were designed to get more of their business. In May, Ryanair said it was \"asleep at the wheel\" as customers got fed up with receiving bad service in return for low fares. Its rival, easyJet, moved upmarket and launched a business package while Ryanair continued to \"unnecessarily piss people off\", in the words of Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive. With O'Leary taking a lower profile, Ryanair has introduced allocated seating, relaxed cabin bag restrictions, reduced charges, and loosened booking conditions. Its chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said more than a quarter of Ryanair customers were already travelling for business. He said the new tickets would not see larger seats or extra facilities, bar perhaps USB chargers on new planes: \"We won't be introducing a blue curtain. Customers haven't asked us for the high business fares and facilities, they just want a bit of flexibility and a better schedule. The schedule is very oriented around business travellers: places like Madrid, Milan and Barcelona have three times daily returns, so they can travel there that morning and come back the same day.\" Ryanair will also be flying to more city-centre airports, and signing a partnership with another global distribution system to make it easier for firms to book airline tickets for their business travellers. Ryanair's profits fell for the first time in five years last year while easyJet expects profits to rise strongly in its financial year, which ends next month. O'Leary had made Ryanair's hidden charges and inflexible booking procedures a selling point to emphasise his cheap fares but consumers grew tired of his antics, forcing a rethink of strategy. Ryanair launched its summer 2015 schedule from London's Stansted airport three months earlier than last year. It announced three new routes, to Cologne, Edinburgh and Glasgow, meaning passenger numbers from the Essex airport should grow by 1.3 million to 17 million next summer. Jacobs said: \"What we're trying to do is get returning customers in who are thinking about next summer's holiday already.\" Jacobs confirmed that Ryanair would be submitting a non-binding offer this week to buy Cyprus Airways, the island's loss-making flag carrier, as it investigates expansion into the Middle East and Russia. The purchase would likely see Ryanair operate the airline's fleet of six leased Airbus planes under its existing Cypriot brand, and give it a licence to spread further. He said: \"It's a very strategic point in the map of Europe, a logical extension of our European route map and meets Asia and the Middle East. It gives you access to all of that \u2013 Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Oman, Israel, Cyprus and Russia. Whether we do it through the acquisition of Cyprus Airways or not, we'll continue to have an interest.\"",
