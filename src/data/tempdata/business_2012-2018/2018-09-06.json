      "bodyText": "The UK high street has posted its worst August performance for three years, in further evidence of the pressure on traditional retailers. Underlying sales at physical stores slid 2.7% last month, compared with August 2017, with homewares and fashion taking the biggest hit, according to the latest data from the advisory firm BDO, which monitors mid-sized, non-food chains. \u201cWith inflation continuing to bite on the weekly shop and the heatwave driving discretionary spending to bars and entertaining, there is even less disposable income heading to the high street,\u201d said Sophie Michael, BDO\u2019s head of retail and wholesale. She said rising interest rates and subdued wage growth meant there was little spare money to spend on fashion or expensive homewares, contributing to declines in underlying sales of 3.6% and 6.1% for those sectors respectively. BDO said August was the seventh month in a row during which high-street sales had fallen, with no boost from an apparent trend towards staycations. While the difficulties on the high street were offset by a 13.7% rise in online sales in August, according to BDO, the latest data will fuel gloom about the future for town centres, which have been hit by a wave of retail closures this year. The difficult August for non-food retailers also pours cold water on hopes raised by an unexpected lift in retail sales in July, when consumers spent heavily on supermarket food and drink as they enjoyed good weather and England\u2019s extended World Cup run. Heavy discounting by clothing stores also brought shoppers back to the high street in July, reversing a decline in sales in June. Michael said there were signs that retailers had protected their profit margins by keeping stocks tight. However, the troubles of major chains, including House of Fraser and Debenhams, have spawned discounting across the market.",

    "webTitle": "China warns US over tariffs, as emerging market fears grow \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our latest piece on the US-China trade dispute: The ISM report also shows that the US-China trade spat is pushing up costs for companies. One executive at a construction firm warned: \u201cTariff-related cost increases are beginning to accelerate, whether tariffs have been put into effect or not.\u201d Another business leader, though, is expecting a record-breaking month: \u201cBased on current trends on customer quote requests and conversions to orders, we are trending for this month to be the best August in the history of our company.\u201d America\u2019s service sector grew strongly last month, according to the latest PMI report from the Institute of Supply Management. The ISM Services index jumped to 58.5 for August, up from 55.7 in July, signalling faster growth. Companies reported a pick-up in new orders (including exports) and overall activity, suggesting the US economy remains in decent fettle. Wall Street has opened cautiously, with the Dow Jones gaining 72 points or 0.3%. Facebook and Twitter are lagging, though, as the fallout from yesterday\u2019s Congress investigation into social media, and foreign interference in elections. Trade war and emerging market jitters are weighing on the City today. The FTSE 100 is down 10 points, or 0.1%, having closed at a four-month low yesterday. That\u2019s despite energy firms rallying. Centrica is up 5.3%, after the government outlined plans to cap bills. The plan will save households around \u00a375 each -- good news, but not as much as PM Theresa May had promised... Some better jobs news just arrived: the number of Americans signing on for unemployment benefit hit its lowest level in almost 50 years! Initial claims for jobless benefits dropped by 10,000 last week to 203,000, the smallest number since December 1969. It extends a long run of decent US employment data, which hasn\u2019t been derailed by the trade wars (yet, anyway). Newsflash: American companies created fewer jobs in August than in July, and less than expected. US payroll operator ADP has reported that 163,000 private sector jobs were created last month, down from 217,000 in July. Economists had expected a figure close to 190,000. It may be a sign that Friday\u2019s US jobs report (the non-farm payroll) will miss expectations. Some lunchtime reading: Joseph Stiglitz on how policymakers have failed to make the right decisions since the financial crisis a decade ago: China has warned that it will retaliate if America imposes fresh tariffs on its goods. Economic ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters in Beijing today that: \u201cIf the United States, regardless of opposition, adopts any new tariff measures, China will be forced to roll out necessary retaliatory measures.\u201d Back in July, the US outlined plans for tariffs on $200bn of Chinese exports (on top of the existing $50bn of tariffs). That includes literally thousands of products; machinery, IT, aerospace parts, paper, leather, chemicals, furniture, meat and fish are all on the list. The consultation period on that plan ends today, meaning Donald Trump could sign them off imminently. In August, China outlined plans for retaliatory tariffs on $60bn of goods if Trump does indeed press the button. This would see levies imposed on over 5,000 items imported from the US, including aircraft, soya bean oil, smoked beef, coffee and flour. China only imported around $129bn of goods from America last year, while exporting around $500bn. That means Beijing can\u2019t match Trump\u2019s $200bn threat in full. The Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s global economist, John Ferguson, believes emerging market tensions will continue to build over the next couple of years. Here\u2019s his take on the EM situation: \u201cMost emerging-market economies should be able to weather this pace of economic tightening, provided that their trading conditions remain favourable. However, investors are on the alert for financial, economic or political weaknesses.\u201d \u201cThe turbulence experienced by Argentina and Turkey in mid-2018 is a reminder of how difficult it can be for policymakers to regain market confidence where external imbalances are large and macroeconomic policy frameworks are fragile.\u201d \u201cFor now, a full-blown emerging-market crisis should be averted, but we expect the number of countries seeing their currencies come under pressure to rise over the next two years. It is likely that we will see periods of volatility as the global trade dispute interacts with the shift away from easy money.\u201d After days of losses, some emerging economy currencies are struggling off the mat. The Argentina peso has gained 1.2% today, having hit a record low earlier this week. The South African rand has gained almost 0.5%, and the Mexican peso is 0.35% higher. Some relief, and perhaps a sign that the recent selloff is bottoming out? Kathleen Brooks of Capital Index argues that the recent rout has been \u2018indiscriminate\u2019. She thinks traders have been too quick to ditch emerging market assets. After all, EM isn\u2019t the only part of the economy with economic and political problems. The fundamentals didn\u2019t add up: we would firstly like to add a caveat that some EM assets are at risk from political and economic pressures (read Turkey), however justifying the ZAR [South African rand] sell off when SA\u2019s current account deficit is lower than the UK\u2019s right now isn\u2019t a good investment decision. Also, political risk is not just the preserve of the emerging market space, take a read of today\u2019s New York Times\u2019 anonymous op-ed from a Trump cabinet member and you will see how close the US is to a constitutional crisis. The EM selloff has pulled world stock markets down for the fifth day in a row. The losses in Asia overnight, followed by the early dip in Europe, pulled the MSCI All-Country World Index down by another 0.2%. The drop in German factory orders added to concerns that trade war rhetoric, and tariffs, is causing economic harm. Economists are also concerned that the problems in certain emerging market economies are now spreading across the sector, and beyond. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says: As global monetary conditions slowly tighten, the global economic cycle rolls over and the US President disturbs the global trade cycle, there\u2019s definitely more to the emerging markets sell-off than a few unrelated spots of weakness. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, agrees that contagion risks can\u2019t be ignored. Crashes in the Argentine Peso and Turkish Lira were first believed to be idiosyncratic risks that wouldn\u2019t lead to any spillover. But now it looks like the concern over contagion risks are spreading to all asset classes. EM equities entered into a bear market, falling 20% from their January peak. The Indonesian Rupee, Indian Rupee, South African Rand, and several other EM currencies are either trading at record or multi-year lows. Investors who have been on the sidelines may think of the selloff as a good opportunity to start accumulating some oversold EM assets. However, the prospects of more U.S. interest rate hikes, and continuing global trade tensions make it difficult to jump in. Germany\u2019s industrial belt has taken another hit from the US-China trade war: German industrial orders shank by 0.9% in July, new figures show, driven by a drop in overseas demand. Economists had expected a rise of 1.8%, following a 3.9% slump in June. But instead, manufacturers reported another decline: Although domestic orders rose, German factories suffered from weaker business overseas, as Destatis explains: Domestic orders increased by 2.4% and foreign orders decreased by 3.4% in July 2018 on the previous month. New orders from the euro area were down 2.7%, new orders from other countries decreased 4.0% compared to June 2018. European stock markets have hit a five-month low this morning. The emerging markets rout, and fears of an escalating trade war, drove the Stoxx 600 index down to its lowest since early April. In London the FTSE 100 dipped to a new four-month low in early trading, at 7,357. Newsflash: The Indian rupee has dropped to an all-time low, as the emerging market currency selloff continues. The rupee fell to 72.095 against the US dollar, breaching the 72-mark for the first time. Last night, the Financial Times calculated that emerging markets are now officially in a bear market -- defined as falling 20% from their recent high. Capital Economics fears that the emerging market rout has further to run: We think that the US Federal Reserve will press ahead with its tightening cycle, and worries about contagion from the crisis in Turkey may linger. At the same time, we expect China\u2019s economy to slow further, and are not anticipating a ceasefire in the US-China trade war any time soon. This snapshot of the markets, from Bloomberg TV, shows how stock markets have lost ground (first column). The second column shows currencies dropping against the US dollar. Today\u2019s selloff has wiped more than 1% off the main Chinese stock index, the CSI 300. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng is down almost 1.5%. Australia\u2019s market has lost 1.1%. That\u2019s it\u2019s biggest one-day loss since March, taking the index to a two-month low. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a worrying time in the financial markets, as emerging economies across the globe come under pressure. Emerging market stocks have fallen steadily for several days, hit by worries over global growth prospects, the strength of the US dollar, and the various trade disputes being driven by the White House this year. Markets were a sea of red yesterday, with notable losses in China, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, as traders scurried for safer assets. There are fresh losses in Asia today, dragging stocks in the region towards a one-year low (more on that shortly). The dollar is currently at its highest level in over a year against a basket of emerging markets currencies, with some at a record lows. That makes it tougher to service foreign debts, and drives up inflation. This forces policymakers to consider steep interest rate rises that will throttle growth. With Argentina signing up for an IMF bailout, Turkey fighting a currency crisis, and Brazil gripped by a corruption scandal, there\u2019s plenty to worry the City right now. Another concern: Donald Trump could deepen the trade war with China, by signing off tariffs on an extra $200bn of imports. An announcement could come today. Such an escalation could cause further harm to China\u2019s economy, with ripple effects hurting other companies in the global supply chain too. That\u2019s another reason emerging markets are feeling the strain today. As Christophe Barraud, an economist at the Paris-based brokerage Market Securities, put it: \u201cPeople are looking closely at what\u2019s happening in emerging markets, at the trade war and the fact that the United States is likely to implement another wave of tariffs against China. If you look at global growth, more and more signs are that it will slow in coming months.\u201d European markets are expected to dip this morning, after the FTSE 100 hit a four-month low yesterday. This follows losses on Wall Street last night, led by the technology sector, after Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey were grilled at Congress. The session has raised speculation that social media could face tougher regulation, to crack down on fake news, harassment and interference by rogue states. As Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: Calls for a negative open come courtesy of downbeat trading on Wall Street, with the Tech sector sharply lower following testimony from Twitter and Facebook to US Congress. The turmoil within emerging markets also continues, widening from Argentina and Turkey, dampening global sentiment even further all the while we await the US decision on additional China import tariffs.

    "webTitle": "UK booksellers call for Amazon to pay 'proper share of taxation'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British booksellers have warned MPs that taxation of Amazon and other digital retailers must be overhauled if the bookshop industry and the high street are to survive. \u201cAmazon may maintain they create jobs but the company is putting numerous competitors out of business,\u201d the Booksellers Association (BA) has told a parliamentary inquiry into the future role of high streets. The BA, which said the number of independent book shops in the UK had halved to 858 since the US retailer\u2019s UK launch two decades ago, added: \u201cBookshops have closed because of Amazon. The current steps being taken to reform the digital economy so that large scale internet retailers pay a proper share of taxation \u2026 should be encouraged and implemented quickly.\u201d The shadow cast by internet home shopping over struggling high streets is one of the key themes of the 75 written submissions received by the housing, communities and local government committee ahead of its first hearing on Monday. Increasingly, fewer Britons are choosing to visit their local shops, which combined with the dramatic cull of bank branches seen in recent years, is contributing to a spiral of high street decline. Meanwhile, Amazon continues to power ahead \u2013 this week it became the second company to be valued by Wall Street at $1tn (\u00a3775bn), a matter of weeks after Apple reached the milestone first. Against the backdrop of a squeeze on consumer spending, there have been a series of high-profile retail failures in the UK, including Toys R Us, Poundworld and House of Fraser, while New Look, Mothercare, Marks &amp; Spencer and Homebase are closing hundreds of stores in total. The British Property Federation (BPF) told MPs that the high street\u2019s decline needed to be taken more seriously by government policymakers. \u201cThis inquiry seeks to establish what our high streets will look like in 2030,\u201d the BPF said. \u201cIt is difficult to look at such a long-time horizon but what we can say with some certainty is most will look awful long before then if the status quo is maintained.\u201d Bill Grimsey, the former Wickes and Iceland chief executive, is among those being called to give evidence. He was among the authors of a recent independent review that suggested the crisis on UK high streets could leave 100,000 shops empty within a decade. The study suggested town centres could be reinvigorated as \u201ccommunity hubs\u201d but by focusing on alternatives to retail such as housing, leisure, education and offices. With many high street campaigners looking to their local council for help, the Local Government Association (LGA) said a lack of financial resources was preventing its members from doing more. \u201cThe ability of councils to proactively support their town centres is constrained as they prioritise their resources on vital and statutory services,\u201d it said. This cash squeeze has had a direct consequences on councils\u2019 ability to deliver the vital transport links, such as bus services, that would bring residents back into struggling town centres, the LGA said. Outside of London, 117m bus miles \u2013 nearly half of all council-subsidised services \u2013 have been lost since 2011. One of the overriding concerns of the respondents was business rates \u2013 a tax based on retail property values \u2013 with the British Beer and Pub Association, which represents the owners of 20,000 pubs, describing the property tax as punishing for landlords and shopkeepers. The tax burden on traditional retailers and pubs is higher than for online businesses because the property values, which underpin the business rates calculations, are typically higher in town centres than for out-of-town warehouses on industrial parks. \u201cBusiness rates need to be reviewed and a new and fairer way to tax businesses needs to be developed,\u201d its chief executive Brigid Simmonds said. \u201cIn the short term \u2026 businesses that benefit from online sales need to be paying more.\u201d In the wake of House of Fraser\u2019s collapse into administration last month, the government hinted that it was considering imposing an \u201cAmazon tax\u201d on online sales. \u201cWe may have to look at temporary tax measures to rebalance the playing field until we can get international agreements sorted out,\u201d Philip Hammond said at the time. An Amazon spokesman said: \u201cWe pay all taxes required in the UK and every country where we operate. In May 2015, to ensure we had the best business structure to serve our customers going forward, we established a local country branch of Amazon EU Sarl in the UK, with all retail revenues, expenses, profits and taxes due now accounted for in the UK. \u201cThis year we plan to create 2,500 permanent jobs across the country in research and development, our head office, customer service and fulfilment centres, to bring our total workforce in the UK to over 27,500.\u201d The submissions include a number of powerful appeals, including from independent retailer Chris Abbott, the third generation owner of Abbotts, a small DIY chain in Devon. He said: \u201cThe UK high street as we know it \u2026 will face obliteration unless swift action is taken.\u201d With \u00a330bn flowing into government coffers from business rates, the Treasury is unlikely to abolish the tax soon but alternatives are being sought. Abbott suggests a parcel tax of 20p to \u00a31 a package: \u201cI think people would accept that the balance is shifting from the high street to online and as a result online retailers will need to start paying their fair share.\u201d",

Those passengers were given the option of cancelling flights for a full refund or adding priority boarding or stowing a small bag \u2013 with the airline adding insult to injury by charging them the higher rates of \u00a38 or \u00a310 for amending an existing booking. With many passengers querying the legality of refusing to honour booking conditions, Ryanair has now conceded by allowing a 10kg bag to be checked in free, for all of the 2 million non-priority customers who booked before 31 August to travel after 1 November. Around 50,000 passengers who had already booked and since bought priority boarding will also have the \u00a38 fee refunded.

The proposed new tariffs from Washington \u2013 levied at 25% of the value of thousands of specific products \u2013 would come on top of existing 25% tariffs on $50bn of Chinese exports, most of which kicked in on 6 July. China was quick to strike back then, imposing tariffs on a similar amount of US goods. Beijing\u2019s economic ministry spokesman, Gao Feng, repeated threats that it would retaliate if a new round of tariffs was imposed: \u201cIf the United States, regardless of opposition, adopts any new tariff measures, China will be forced to roll out necessary retaliatory measures.\u201d The consultation period on the new tariffs ends on Thursday, which means Donald Trump could sign off on them imminently. The first wave of US tariffs mainly affected aerospace, IT and medical equipment. The second wave would affect 6,000 more Chinese products imported into the US, including many metals and chemicals, but also everyday consumer goods such as toilet paper, deodorants, shampoo, furniture, meat and fish. Also on the list are more unusual items such as badger hair for shaving brushes, shark fins, eels and portable forges. In August, China outlined plans for its retaliatory measures, with dutieson $60bn of goods. Levies would be imposed on more than 5,000 goods imported from the US, including aircraft, soya bean oil, smoked beef, coffee and flour. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at the foreign exchange platform Oanda, said new US tariffs would be a major escalation by Trump in the US-China dispute. \u201cThis would represent a significant ramping up of the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies and show the US electorate ahead of the mid-term [elections] that he will not shy away from his strategy, regardless of the warnings against doing so.\u201d China imported $129bn of goods from the US last year, while exporting about $500bn, so Beijing cannot match Trump\u2019s $200bn threat in full. This week it emerged the US trade deficit \u2013 the gap between imports and exports \u2013 widened by more than $4bn to $50.1bn in July, as the trade gap with China hit another record high. The deficit with the EU also rose to a record high. Mounting global trade tensions have been weighing on global markets. Emerging markets stocks and currencies were hit by heavy sell-offs in recent days, pressured by the strengthening US dollar \u2013 seen as a safe currency to buy in times of trouble \u2013 and also boosted by the prospect of higher US interest rates. There are worries that other countries could follow Argentina and Turkey into financial crisis, while South Africa has entered into recession. Some emerging markets currencies staged a small recovery on Thursday, including the Argentinian peso, which hit a record low on Monday, the South African rand and the Mexican peso. The Indian rupee dropped to a new all-time low, falling to 72.095 against the dollar.",

      "bodyText": "Burberry is to end its practice of burning unsold clothes, bags and perfume and will also stop using real fur after criticism from environmental campaigners. The British fashion house destroyed unsold \u00a328.6m worth of products last year to protect its brand and prevent unwanted stock from being sold at knockdown prices, taking the value of items destroyed over the past five years to \u00a3105m. It has previously defended its practice by saying that the energy generated from burning its goods was captured. The FTSE 100 company now says it will reuse, repair, donate or recycle all unsaleable products. Burberry is the first major company to publicly end the practice of destroying unwanted products. Marco Gobbetti, its chief executive, said he hoped others in the industry would follow suit. Gobbetti said: \u201cModern luxury means being socially and environmentally responsible. This belief is core to us at Burberry and key to our long-term success. We are committed to applying the same creativity to all parts of Burberry as we do to our products.\u201d Burberry shareholders have questioned why the unsold products were not offered to the company\u2019s private investors. Greenpeace welcomed the move as a \u201cmuch-needed sign of a change of mind in the fashion industry\u201d. Kirsten Brodde, who leads the Detox My Fashion campaign at the NGO, said: \"Because fashion is a high-volume business with more than 100bn garments produced each year, consumers\u2019 closets are already overflowing with unworn clothes, creating an overstock problem for many companies. \u201cIt\u2019s high time for the whole fashion industry to start dealing with overstock at its source: by slowing down production and rethinking the way it does business.\" Burberry will also end the use of real fur and says the debut collection from its new chief creative officer, Riccardo Tisci, to be presented on 17 September during London fashion week, will not feature any. Existing fur products will be phased out. Wendy Higgins of Humane Society International UK said it first met Burberry almost a decade ago to urge the company to drop fur. \u201cMost British consumers don\u2019t want anything to do with the cruelty of fur and so this is absolutely the right decision by this quintessentially British brand. And as fashion week kicks off today in New York, Burberry\u2019s compassionate stance couldn't have come at a better time, sending a strong message to designers like Prada still using fur, who are looking more and more isolated and outdated by the day.\u201d The change in chief creative officer also means a new logo. Burberry stressed that all the clothes and accessories, headed paper, shopping bags and packaging affected by this would be reused or recycled. It is a common practice among fashion firms to destroy unsold items to prevent them being stolen or sold cheaply. Earlier this year it emerged that the Swiss watchmaker Richemont, which owns the Cartier and Montblanc brands, had destroyed nearly \u20ac500m of its designer timepieces over the past two years to avoid them being sold at knockdown prices. Burberry reiterated that it takes its environmental obligations seriously and in May joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation\u2019s Make Fashion Circular initiative to prevent waste in the industry.",

    "webTitle": "Energy bills to be cut by around \u00a375 for more than 11m households", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than 11m households will have their energy bills cut by about \u00a375 a year under a price cap being imposed by the industry regulator, Ofgem, following a political outcry over companies taking advantage of loyal customers. The average saving falls short of the \u00a3100 that Theresa May promised for consumers on poor value default tariffs before she handed over responsibility for setting the cap to Ofgem. The overall saving from capping bills at \u00a31,136 a year is expected to be about \u00a31bn, which would largely wipe out combined profits of \u00a3924m made by the big six energy companies last year. There are 11m UK households on the default tariffs covered by the cap, but only 3m of those will save more than \u00a3100 because they are either on the market\u2019s most expensive default tariff or are high energy users. By contrast, those on the cheapest default tariff offered by the six large suppliers will save just \u00a360. The upper limit for default tariffs, known as standard variable tariffs (SVT), will be set at \u00a31,136, based on typical fuel consumption and paying by direct debit, Ofgem said. The figure is in line with analysts\u2019 expectations. The average big six SVT is \u00a31,220, though if npower or SSE announce a second price hike this year before the cap, like their rivals, that figure would rise. Ofgem could account for that in the final version of the cap, which is not due to be confirmed until the end of October. Dermot Nolan, the regulator\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOfgem has made full use of the powers parliament has given us to propose a tough price cap which will give a fairer deal to consumers on poor-value default tariffs.\u201d Greg Clark, the business secretary, said: \u201cThis government is delivering on its promise to end that injustice and protect households across the country from unjustified price rises.\u201d Labour\u2019s Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said that while the price cap was a start, it was less than had been promised. \u201cTheresa May promised 17m households would be better off by up to \u00a3100. Today\u2019s announcement is a smaller saving for fewer people. Despite promises from the prime minister, the government has continued to sit on their hands while the big six have hiked prices. \u201cTory dithering means that millions of customers will now be even worse off than when Theresa May first made her promise.\u201d The share price of Centrica, owner of Britain\u2019s biggest energy provider, British Gas, rose 5% on the news. Analysts at Jefferies bank said the cap was \u00a312 higher than their estimate and the impact on Centrica would be manageable. However, the industry body Energy UK said the cap would pose a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d for some suppliers. Nolan said some companies would have to become more efficient, a phrase which usually refers to job losses. E.ON has already announced 500 job cuts, which it blamed on the cap, and the merger of npower and SSE is expected to lead to further losses. \u201cWe expect there to be lower profitability going forward. If they want profitability they need to make those kinds of cuts,\u201d Nolan said. The level of the cap will be adjustable every six months and it will be reviewed in April and October of each year. Changes will depend on costs facing suppliers, such as the wholesale price of gas and electricity, which has been rising this year. Bernstein bank said it could jump by \u00a3108 next April. Nolan and industry watchers stressed that the biggest savings for households would still come from switching suppliers. Comparison sites, which stand to suffer if switching falls because people think they are now protected, said the cap would still leave people overpaying. uSwitch accused Ofgem of playing a \u201cdangerous game\u201d by presenting the cap as a fair price, given the cheapest deals on the market were about \u00a3300 lower. \u201cDon\u2019t get lulled into a false sense of security by the political soundbites,\u201d said Stephen Murray, an energy expert at Moneysupermarket. The consumer groups Citizen\u2019s Advice and Which? welcomed the cap as a step in the right direction but echoed the calls for people to shop around and switch. It remains to be seen whether the big suppliers will all bunch their prices together just below the cap when it takes effect at the end of the year. Under an existing, narrower cap for 4m vulnerable households on prepayment meters, all six have priced their tariffs at the same, maximum level allowed.",
