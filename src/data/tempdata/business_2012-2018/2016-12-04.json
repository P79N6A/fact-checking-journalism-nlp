      "bodyText": "Dictators and human rights abusers who buy luxury property in London and use the UK to conceal their wealth could have their assets seized under an MPs\u2019 initiative. A group of backbenchers are seeking to amend the government\u2019s criminal finances bill and introduce a clause targeting those guilty of human rights abuses outside Britain. It would allow officials and organisations such as Amnesty International to apply for an order to freeze their UK assets. The amendment is named after the Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in prison in Moscow in 2009 after exposing an alleged $230m (\u00a3181m) fraud carried out by leading Kremlin officials. The initiative enjoys unusually wide cross-party support. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant said the chances of it becoming law were \u201cquite positive\u201d. The bill, which could come into force as early as spring 2017, is designed to clean up London\u2019s reputation as a haven for \u201cdirty money\u201d. Its existing provisions target corrupt politicians and international criminals who launder money through the capital\u2019s banks and plough stolen cash into high-end real estate. The National Crime Agency estimates that up to \u00a3100bn of dubious money passes through the UK a year. The Magnitsky amendment, which will be tabled on Monday, could result in high court judges passing two-year freezing orders on human rights abusers. There will be a right to appeal. The Conservative MP Dominic Raab, who tabled the amendment, said: \u201cPeople with blood on their hands for the worst human rights abuses should not be able to funnel their dirty money into the UK. This change in the law will protect Britain from becoming a safe place for despots and dictators to hide their money.\u201d The former Labour MP Denis MacShane said going after the London assets of state functionaries was \u201can updated version of getting Al Capone on tax evasion charges because it was not possible to bring him to justice for murder\u201d. \u201cIt will sow panic in the ranks of Putin apparatchiks who want to own flats and hide money in London, and send children to private schools in the UK,\u201d he said. Supporters of the proposal include the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas, the SNP and the Ukip MP Douglas Carswell. The Labour MP and former public accounts committee chair Margaret Hodge said Britain had been \u201ca safe haven for foreign kleptocrats and their ill-gotten gains\u201d for too long, adding: \u201cWe hope this legislation will end this.\u201d The Home Office says the bill, introduced in October, will significantly improve the government\u2019s ability to tackle money laundering and corruption, recover the proceeds of crime and impact upon terrorist financing. It follows an anti-corruption summit hosted by the then prime minister David Cameron in May and revelations in the Panama Papers that foreign autocrats and their families used offshore structures to buy London property. Under the Magnitsky amendment, the names of individuals who have been involved in, or profited from, human rights abuse would be published. Ministers would be obliged to apply for an order if they are presented with compelling evidence of abuse and it is in the public interest to do so. The amendment is the latest in a series of legislative initiatives around the world to end the impunity of those involved in the Magnitsky case and other human rights abuses. In 2012, the US Congress passed a Magnitsky act, which sanctioned the Russian officials involved and provoked a furious backlash from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s information commissioner has reopened the file on construction industry blacklisting amid fears that the malpractice is still taking place. Elizabeth Denham, who is charged with protecting data privacy, told the Guardian she has already \u201creviewed\u201d her office\u2019s papers on blacklisting since taking up the post in July. The 57-year-old Canadian is so concerned by the scandal, which was seemingly settled in court this year, that she told staff to begin \u201ca watching brief\u201d on the construction industry to make sure the practice has ended. Denham, who was previously the information and privacy commissioner for British Columbia in Canada, said: \u201cI read about that case, I\u2019ve looked into that case, and it was deeply concerning. \u201cThat practice was deeply concerning to me, and we do have some follow-up plans and that\u2019s all I can say right now: we are following up. I think the practice is something we have to be alert to checking, to make sure that it has ceased. \u201cIt means keeping tabs, it means a watching file, a watching brief \u2026 It\u2019s fair to say that I\u2019ve reviewed that file.\u201d The blacklisting scandal hit the headlines when the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) raided a Worcestershire-based company called the Consulting Association in 2009. The organisation kept a list of more than 3,000 workers, including details \u2013 often incorrect \u2013 of their political views and trade union activities that were used to vet them when applying for jobs. There were also notes on personal relationships and suggestions that workers were incompetent. Some of the biggest names in the construction sector, including Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Laing O\u2019Rourke and Sir Robert McAlpine, settled with the GMB, Ucatt and Unite unions this year on allegations of using the list. The companies denied blacklisting, arguing that automatic discrimination did not occur when the lists were used. Nevertheless, the practice was rumoured for years. It is alleged to have gone on for more than four decades and the Consulting Association\u2019s data stretched back to the early 1990s. Workers were checked against the list for jobs on publicly funded projects such as the London 2012 Olympic Park and the Millennium Dome. Unite\u2019s settlement saw 256 workers share more than \u00a310m in compensation this year. GMB and Ucatt, which is the main construction workers\u2019 union with 80,000 members in the UK and Ireland, received about \u00a375m for 771 claimants in April. However, it has long been feared that the practice is deeper rooted than the initial investigation found and that blacklisting continues. The ICO is best known for making sure that companies and the government adhere to the 1998 Data Protection Act, and for monitoring the correct use of the 2000 Freedom of Information Act. It also tackles the misuse of personal data, meaning that blacklisting is within the ICO\u2019s remit. The GMB national secretary, Justin Bowden, said: \u201cThe GMB would welcome further investigation into the nefarious activities of systematic blacklisting of 3,500 trade unionists and environmental activists by the household names of the construction industry. \u201cWe have always called for greater rigour by the ICO alongside a public inquiry, and for blacklisting to become a criminal offence punishable by prison and unlimited fines.\u201d Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cBlacklisting in construction was an appalling scandal and the victims have never had full justice. That\u2019s why we called for a full inquiry that could also consider whether the law itself needs to be changed. \u201cMinisters can\u2019t just leave this to the information commissioner and it\u2019s well past time they stepped in and took proper action, to ensure all those involved are accountable and this never happens again.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca has said it will move some back office jobs from the UK to Costa Rica, Poland and Malaysia in a drive to cut costs following a slide in profits. The pharmaceuticals company is consulting staff from its 280-person finance division at Alderley Park in Cheshire, but did not say how many roles were likely to be transferred. Some jobs will be moved to the company\u2019s Cambridge headquarters, but AstraZeneca said others will be shifted to new offices in other countries, where staff costs will be lower. AstraZeneca said it was \u201ccommitted to improving efficiency, simplifying processes and driving cost-effectiveness as we sharpen our focus on delivering our strategy to return to growth\u201d. \u201cAs part of this global process, in the UK, the plan is to move some finance roles from Alderley Park to either our new headquarters and science centre in Cambridge or to newly created regional centres (Costa Rica, Kuala Lumpur and Warsaw) over the next two years,\u201d it said. \u201cThe overall impact in terms of numbers of employees will only become clear once the consultation period has finished and employees have taken their own decisions. \u201cEmployees globally have been briefed on these changes and individual employee consultations will now begin for impacted individuals. Naturally these discussions will remain confidential.\u201d AstraZeneca said the changes were part of efforts to shore up the company\u2019s finances as it wrestles with a 13% drop in profit in the first nine months of 2016 to $4.7bn (\u00a33.69bn). Earlier this year, the company said it hoped to bring down annual costs by $1.1bn by the end of 2017, through a series of cost-cutting measures. At the time, the chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said most job cuts would affect the company\u2019s non-British salesforce and the impact on the UK would be minimal. AstraZeneca had a large research and development operation at Alderley Park, but moved 1,600 jobs to Cambridge and cut another 700 in 2013. That came a year after the company axed 7,300 jobs in an earlier drive to reduce costs. The security of AstraZeneca\u2019s workforce was an important issue two years ago when the company successfully fought off a takeover attempt from its US rival Pfizer. At the time, unions warned that Pfizer would cut jobs and close facilities in the UK if the deal went through.",

      "bodyText": "The post-match interview is a familiar part of TV\u2019s coverage of football. Win or lose, managers are put in front of a camera to give their assessment of the match. Football fans know the drill: when a team has lost, the manager can reel off a list of blatantly bad refereeing calls that have cost his side the game, but he is always unsighted when it comes to offences committed by his own side. As a long-time Spurs season ticket holder, I have observed that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, is the master of this technique for explaining away defeat. Those still having trouble accepting the result of the EU referendum in June seem to be taking their cue from the Arsenal boss. They see what they want to see and ignore everything else. A Wenger-style interview on the referendum campaign would go something like this: Post-match interviewer: \u201cWhat are your thoughts on the result?\u201d AW: \u201cI thought we were clearly the better team but were robbed of victory because the other side cheated. The claim that leaving the EU would result in an extra \u00a3350m a week for the NHS was a complete lie.\u201d PMI: But what about the fouls committed by your side? The Treasury forecast that the economy would plunge straight into recession in the event of a leave vote, for example? AW: My view of that was obscured. PMI: How about the idea that there would be an emergency budget involving \u00a330bn of tax increases and spending cuts? Wasn\u2019t that a bit over the top? AW: I saw nothing wrong with that challenge. Remain supporters may well be suffering from collective amnesia about the Treasury\u2019s blatant scare tactics in the run-up to the referendum, but those on the other side are not. As one member of the audience from last week\u2019s BBC Question Time in Wakefield noted: \u201cWhatever happened to the 10% fall in house prices?\u201d The truth is that both sides in the Brexit debate embellished, obfuscated and misrepresented. That\u2019s hardly surprising because politics, like football, is a contact sport and when you put two well-matched teams up against each other you should expect crunching tackles and a few yellow cards. Instead of arguing about the result and seeking for the match to be replayed, the remain side might be better off working out why it lost. One key reason was that the Europe that exists in the imagination of many on the remain side is not the one that exists in reality. Immigration was an important factor in deciding the referendum and the reason people have been coming to the UK is because jobs are easier to find. The presidential runoff in Austria and the referendum in Italy this weekend are a reminder that the Brexit vote had a European dimension: it was influenced by the wretched performance of the eurozone since its creation 15 years ago. The Italian economy is no bigger than it was at the turn of the millennium and persistent double-digit unemployment means that Marine Le Pen will be in the runoff in the French presidential election. Remain chose to ramp up \u201cProject Fear\u201d rather than make the pitch that by being inside the single market but outside the single currency the UK had the best of both worlds. No attempt was made to change tactics even when the game was slipping away. The remain side believe that all is not lost. It is confident that 2017 will see a change in UK attitudes towards Brexit because higher inflation will lead to weaker growth in living standards. This, though, suggests a continued reliance on the long-ball tactics of Project Fear, with the assumption that a squeeze on real incomes will lead to buyers\u2019 remorse on the part of those who voted to leave. This is possible but not certain. For a start, the Brexit side will argue that the economy was doing fine until the remainers threw a spanner in the works by forcing the government to delay the start of divorce proceedings. Growth was 0.5% in the third quarter and the early signs are that it is on course for something similar in the fourth quarter. Moreover, the squeeze on real incomes has two dimensions: prices going up as a result of a falling pound and wages being held down. The latter will be blamed on the increase in the supply of labour and linked to the failure to control immigration. Finally, the spotlight in 2017 is not just going to be on the UK: elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany mean it will be on Europe as well. Ahead of negotiations, there has been much focus on the UK government\u2019s plan (or lack of one) and whether it makes sense. Little has been heard about the other side, other than to assume that the other 27 members of the European Union hold all the cards. No question, it would be possible for the EU team to make life difficult for the UK. For example, Europe\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, would only need to say that talks were going badly and that no deal was in prospect to send the pound tumbling. This, though, is not a cost-free strategy. A weaker pound means exports from the EU27 to the UK would become more expensive. And since eurozone growth, such as it is, depends on exports, this would lead to higher unemployment and more political discontent. Similarly, attempts to make life difficult for the City of London could easily backfire. European companies and governments come to London to borrow money for one simple reason: it is cheaper to do so in the UK than anywhere else. That\u2019s a function of Europe\u2019s economic geography: countries have tended to specialise in what they are good at. The Germans do the precision engineering; the French do the food and drink; Britain, as Mark Carney pointed out last week, is Europe\u2019s investment banker. The Italian government, for one, might not relish the prospect of paying more to finance its massive national debt. Going it alone involves obvious risks for the UK, but Europe\u2019s economic weakness has made it less scary for many voters. In 1973, membership looked like an opportunity to join the big league: Leicester City having the chance to play Real Madrid. Remain supporters say \u2013 rightly \u2013 that Britain is a mid-table side a long way short of Champions League class. But on the other side of the Channel, only Germany remains a member of the economic elite. France is like Newcastle, a big club that has dropped out of the big league; Italy is like Aston Villa, in danger of dropping into the third tier, and Greece is Coventry City, in danger of going out of business altogether. Remainers seem to have trouble seeing this. Presumably the fourth official is blocking the view.",

    "webTitle": "Opec doesn\u2019t hold all the cards, even after its oil price agreement", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Two years of wrangling were needed before Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Opec oil cartel could agree a cut in production at its meeting in Vienna last week. Ever since the collapse in crude prices in 2014, the big oil-producing countries have plotted a way to regain control and improve their battered finances. But agreeing which countries would bear the pain of the steepest production cuts had proved an insurmountable challenge. That barrier proved less formidable once prices stayed persistently low into 2016. With a recovery in the crude market nowhere in sight, finally one member after another fell into line at Vienna \u2013 and crucially Russia, a non-Opec producer, agreed to a cut of its own. It means that for UK motorists the days of \u00a31-a-litre of petrol are likely to fast become a distant memory. It was only back in January that the price of a barrel of Brent crude tumbled towards $27 and some analysts forecast that it could reach as low as $10. There was joy among western leaders who dared to believe that the era of stellar economic growth that characterised the 1990s, fuelled as it was by super-low oil prices that rarely pushed above $20 a barrel, was about to return. But a long run of ultra-cheap prices was not to be; Brent quickly bounced back and spent the rest of the year moving between the $40-$50 mark. None the less, Opec, which produces a third of the world\u2019s crude oil, wanted more and announced that it would cut production by around 4%, or 1.2m barrels a day, to bring output down to 32.5m barrels a day in January. The cut is an effort to put a $50-a-barrel floor under the price and push it towards $60 a barrel within a few months. Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of fund manager Sun Global Investments, says: \u201cOil prices are truly on course for a recovery. The first coordinated action by the Opec members in eight years has definitely set a new price outlook for the commodity. The longer-term impact on oil price will depend on the implementation of the accord, and discipline in sticking to the accord.\u201d But few in the oil business expect a return to the prices which dominated the early part of the decade, including the most recent peak of $114 two years ago. It is more likely that a $60 cap will emerge as the Americans, who stand outside the 13-member Opec grouping, unplug the spigots that have kept their shale oil fields from producing in the last year or two. It is the emergence of shale drilling \u2013 where pumping a mixture of chemicals, water and sand into dense rock releases trapped oil \u2013 that has prevented Opec from controlling supply and demand in the way it did in the past. \u201cGlobal, and especially US, crude oil inventories are currently at extremely high levels after two years of massive oversupply,\u201d Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale analysts say. \u201cWhile the Opec agreement is very significant and will result in some moderate global stockdraws next year, it is likely to take more than one year for crude inventory levels to return to more normal levels.\u201d The return to action of once-idle derricks on the Texas and Dakota plains is the result of efficiency savings that have seen large jobs losses and a more streamlined approach to drilling from the US industry, after the post-2014 price tumble rendered many operators unprofitable. Only a few years ago, many firms struggled to make a profit at $70 a barrel. Now they can be competitive at much lower prices, with many expecting $50 for West Texas Intermediate \u2013 a lighter crude that typically earns $5 a barrel less than Brent. Since the start of June about 25 US oil rigs have been moving into the market every month. Most firms report taking a cautious approach to give themselves time to assess the Opec agreement and whether it will hold. Analysts at Oxford Economics say the US shale industry is right to be wary. It says a general lack of global demand for oil is another downward pressure on prices and will keep them below $60 a barrel, at least until the end of 2018. A history of Opec governments cheating to improve their revenues \u2013 by pumping more oil in contravention of production cuts \u2013 is also likely to undermine efforts to cut output, they say. Saudi Arabia, which has long been the main producer and most powerful political operator in the Opec cartel, has dug deep into its reserves to make up the shortfall in its public finances following two years of low prices. It hoped to cripple the US frackers by holding down prices. Under that plan, it would then have ratcheted them up again with a well-timed production squeeze. But the US industry has not collapsed and Saudi Arabia has seen its budget ravaged as prices stayed low, forcing an embarrassed King Salman to cut subsidies and services. In the wake of the Vienna agreement, Saudi Arabia will lead the way with reductions of 0.49m barrels a day, with Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait taking smaller hits. Other minor reductions have been promised by Algeria, Angola and Venezuela, while Iran \u2013 which faces the reinstatement of sanctions by an incoming Trump presidency \u2013 was allowed to freeze or marginally increase output. Last Friday, the new strategy appeared to be working. The spot price of Brent crude managed to break out of the $43-$54 range that has been the norm since mid-April, giving a lift to the revenues that oil producers crave. But with the US shale producers still in play, the move is likely to put a floor under the price only, not send it into the stratosphere. Oxford Economics says that, cheating aside, weak demand due to the state of the global economy is one of the biggest barriers to high prices. The fragility of the Vienna deal, and the six-month timescale to implement it, are another two elements keeping forecasts muted. Russia, which is not an Opec member and produces about as much oil as Saudi Arabia, counts as a further reason for caution. It is supposed to be part of the new arrangement, and officials in Moscow are scheduled to announce production cuts next week. The press conference is likely to go ahead, but analysts are sceptical there will be a significant move to cut production when oil revenues make up most of the Russian government\u2019s income. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at spread betting firm IG, says: \u201cA likely rise in US output, in response to higher prices, and an increasing rig count will counteract some of [the production] cut, while the opaque nature of national crude output mean that enforcement will be unreliable at best.\u201d Enforcement of the Vienna deal is the key to preventing oil prices from falling again. But the interaction of supply and demand, most of it outside Opec\u2019s control, means that for the next couple of years, prices are probably going nowhere fast. Who benefits? WINNERS BP and Shell The prospect of a cut to production from January lifted oil prices last week and with them the shares of energy companies. Royal Dutch Shell and BP were the biggest gainers in the FTSE 100 on the day of the deal, on predictions oil could climb to $60 a barrel. Nicola Sturgeon The prospect of higher oil prices should bring some relief to Scotland\u2019s first minister. More than a year of oil prices around or below $50 has put pressure on the North Sea oil industry. Crude in the region has become increasingly tricky to reach and lower returns make investing in oil extraction harder to justify. That in turn has cost jobs, hit tax receipts and blown a hole in Scotland\u2019s public finances. Scotland\u2019s deficit ballooned last year as its share of North Sea oil tax revenues collapsed to \u00a360m from \u00a31.8bn the previous year. Shale A combination of weak demand and a decision by Saudi Arabia to keep production levels high had pushed oil prices down sharply since the summer of 2014. Riyadh\u2019s hope was that low crude prices would push higher-cost US shale producers out of business. But it didn\u2019t: and now that prices have risen, shale fields in the US are expected to ramp up their production. LOSERS Motorists Petrol prices are set to rise after the Opec deal sent crude surging. In the UK, petrol costs could increase by as much as 9p a litre, adding almost \u00a35 to the cost of filling up an average family car, according to motoring organisations. Higher oil prices could also push up household energy bills as wholesale gas tends to track the price of crude. But petrolheads\u2019 loss could well be environmentalists\u2019 gain, if higher pump prices push people towards electric cars or just into driving less. Saudi Arabia The kingdom flooded the markets with cheap crude in a bid to kill off US shale, but now it has effectively admitted defeat; Saudi is bearing the brunt of Opec\u2019s production cut. On the other hand, it stands to gain a little from a higher oil price: that would offset some of the pain from production cuts and make the stake in state oil producer Aramco, which it is planning to float, more valuable. Airlines Carriers have benefited from cheap fuel over the last two years but now their costs look set to start rising again. Shares in airlines, including Ryanair and easyJet, fell as Opec reached its deal. Katie Allen",

      "body": "<p>Two years of wrangling were needed before Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Opec oil cartel could agree a cut in production <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/30/oil-price-opec-cut-in-output-saudi-arabia-deal-market\" title=\"\">at its meeting in Vienna last week</a>.</p> <p>Ever since the collapse in crude prices in 2014, the big oil-producing countries have plotted a way to regain control and improve their battered finances. But agreeing which countries would bear the pain of the steepest production cuts had proved an insurmountable challenge.</p> <p>That barrier proved less formidable once prices stayed persistently low into 2016. With a recovery in the crude market nowhere in sight, finally one member after another fell into line at Vienna \u2013 and crucially Russia, a non-Opec producer, agreed to a cut of its own.</p> <p>It means that for UK motorists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/17/oil-price-slump-true-cost-uk-economy\" title=\"\">the days of \u00a31-a-litre of petrol are likely to fast become a distant memory</a>.</p> <p>It was only back in January that the price of a barrel of Brent crude tumbled towards $27 and some analysts forecast that it could reach as low as $10. There was joy among western leaders who dared to believe that the era of stellar economic growth that characterised the 1990s, fuelled as it was by super-low oil prices that rarely pushed above $20 a barrel, was about to return.</p> <p>But a long run of ultra-cheap prices was not to be; Brent quickly bounced back and spent the rest of the year moving between the $40-$50 mark. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC\" title=\"\">None the less, Opec, which produces a third of the world\u2019s crude oil</a>, wanted more and announced that it would cut production by around 4%, or 1.2m barrels a day, to bring output down to 32.5m barrels a day in January. The cut is an effort to put a $50-a-barrel floor under the price and push it towards $60 a barrel within a few months.</p> <p>Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of fund manager Sun Global Investments, says: \u201cOil prices are truly on course for a recovery. The first coordinated action by the Opec members in eight years has definitely set a new price outlook for the commodity. The longer-term impact on oil price will depend on the implementation of the accord, and discipline in sticking to the accord.\u201d</p> <p>But few in the oil business expect a return to the prices which dominated the early part of the decade, including the most recent peak of $114 two years ago. It is more likely that a $60 cap will emerge as the Americans, who stand outside the 13-member Opec grouping, unplug the spigots that have kept their shale oil fields from producing in the last year or two. It is the emergence of shale drilling \u2013 where pumping a mixture of chemicals, water and sand into dense rock releases trapped oil \u2013 that has prevented Opec from controlling supply and demand in the way it did in the past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb5f5a37611f077544f9dbfc9bb57bcedd7108f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb5f5a37611f077544f9dbfc9bb57bcedd7108f6/0_0_5103_3061/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Ras Tanurah refinery in Saudi Arabia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ras Tanurah refinery in Saudi Arabia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas J. Abercrombie/National Geographic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cGlobal, and especially US, crude oil inventories are currently at extremely high levels after two years of massive oversupply,\u201d Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale analysts say. \u201cWhile the Opec agreement is very significant and will result in some moderate global stockdraws next year, it is likely to take more than one year for crude inventory levels to return to more normal levels.\u201d</p> <p>The return to action of once-idle derricks on the Texas and Dakota plains is the result of efficiency savings that have seen large jobs losses and a more streamlined approach to drilling from the US industry, after the post-2014 price tumble rendered many operators unprofitable. Only a few years ago, many firms struggled to make a profit at $70 a barrel. Now they can be competitive at much lower prices, with many expecting $50 for West Texas Intermediate \u2013 a lighter crude that typically earns $5 a barrel less than Brent.</p> <p>Since the start of June about 25 US oil rigs have been moving into the market every month. Most firms report taking a cautious approach to give themselves time to assess the Opec agreement and whether it will hold.</p> <p>Analysts at Oxford Economics say the US shale industry is right to be wary. It says a general lack of global demand for oil is another downward pressure on prices and will keep them below $60 a barrel, at least until the end of 2018. A history of Opec governments cheating to improve their revenues \u2013 by pumping more oil in contravention of production cuts \u2013 is also likely to undermine efforts to cut output, they say.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia, which has long been the main producer and most powerful political operator in the Opec cartel, has dug deep into its reserves to make up the shortfall in its public finances following two years of low prices. It hoped to cripple the US frackers by holding down prices. Under that plan, it would then have ratcheted them up again with a well-timed production squeeze. But the US industry has not collapsed and Saudi Arabia has seen its budget ravaged as prices stayed low, forcing an embarrassed King Salman to cut subsidies and services.</p> <p>In the wake of the Vienna agreement, Saudi Arabia will lead the way with reductions of 0.49m barrels a day, with Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait taking smaller hits. Other minor reductions have been promised by Algeria, Angola and Venezuela, while Iran \u2013 which faces the reinstatement of sanctions by an incoming Trump presidency \u2013 was allowed to freeze or marginally increase output.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a69074e0fe28046cc7d2b6470f4b91fc3218238a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a69074e0fe28046cc7d2b6470f4b91fc3218238a/0_200_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fuel being delivered to a petrol station in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fuel being delivered to a petrol station in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/01/opec-deal-pushes-oil-price-up-to-54-a-barrel\" title=\"\">Last Friday, the new strategy appeared to be working</a>. The spot price of Brent crude managed to break out of the $43-$54 range that has been the norm since mid-April, giving a lift to the revenues that oil producers crave.</p> <p>But with the US shale producers still in play, the move is likely to put a floor under the price only, not send it into the stratosphere.</p> <p>Oxford Economics says that, cheating aside, weak demand due to the state of the global economy is one of the biggest barriers to high prices. The fragility of the Vienna deal, and the six-month timescale to implement it, are another two elements keeping forecasts muted.</p> <p>Russia, which is not an Opec member and produces about as much oil as Saudi Arabia, counts as a further reason for caution. It is supposed to be part of the new arrangement, and officials in Moscow are scheduled to announce production cuts next week. The press conference is likely to go ahead, but analysts are sceptical there will be a significant move to cut production when oil revenues make up most of the Russian government\u2019s income.</p> <p>Joshua Mahony, market analyst at spread betting firm IG, says: \u201cA likely rise in US output, in response to higher prices, and an increasing rig count will counteract some of [the production] cut, while the opaque nature of national crude output mean that enforcement will be unreliable at best.\u201d</p> <p>Enforcement of the Vienna deal is the key to preventing oil prices from falling again. But the interaction of supply and demand, most of it outside Opec\u2019s control, means that for the next couple of years, prices are probably going nowhere fast.</p> <h2>Who benefits?</h2> <p><strong>WINNERS</strong><br><strong>BP and Shell </strong>The prospect of a cut to production from January lifted oil prices last week and with them the shares of energy companies. Royal Dutch Shell and BP were the biggest gainers in the FTSE 100 on the day of the deal, on predictions oil could climb to $60 a barrel.</p> <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon </strong>The prospect of higher oil prices should bring some relief to Scotland\u2019s first minister. More than a year of oil prices around or below $50 has put pressure on the North Sea oil industry. Crude in the region has become increasingly tricky to reach and lower returns make investing in oil extraction harder to justify. That in turn has cost jobs, hit tax receipts and blown a hole in Scotland\u2019s public finances.

      "bodyText": "As the nation\u2019s shoppers turn their thoughts to Christmas, a dark cloud looms. Could it be that rising inflation will spoil the party? Only a few weeks ago, Theresa May, Philip Hammond and the rest of the cabinet could have been forgiven for worrying about the impact of inflation after most economic forecasters predicted it was about to send shop prices sky-rocketing. And, worse, more of the same is expected next year, with rising prices eating into disposable incomes to more than halve Britain\u2019s GDP growth rate. In recent days the news has been better. Comments by Hammond and Brexit minister David Davis holding out the possibility of a more accommodative stance towards the European Union have pushed up the value of sterling against the dollar and euro and cut the chances of a much more expensive festive period. Of course, a higher pound could snuff out a welcome recovery in manufacturing output since August. But voters shop much more than they work in manufacturing. So from the narrow perspective of a government attempting to keep the population on side during a potentially turbulent pre-article 50 negotiation period, during which migration data shows record numbers of continental Europeans rocking up on British shores, a lack of inflation will be good news. This situation is unlikely to hold. Davis\u2019s comments that Britain might find a way to pay for access to the single market was simply another way of saying that all options were open. Hammond was also repeating himself: more importantly, he is well known as being a soft Brexiter, a breed vastly outnumbered around the cabinet table. Next week the theme could be hard Brexit \u2013 a change directed as much by the EU\u2019s tough-talking negotiators as by a wild comment from Boris Johnson \u2013 pushing sterling down again. The difficulty in predicting inflation while the Brexit conflict continues lies behind the divergence between various forecasts, with the National Institute of Economic and Social Research reckoning it could rise to 4% by the end of 2017, while others believe prices will grow by little more than 2%. Unfortunately for the forecasters, the pound is not the only influence on prices. There is also the impact that comes from demand for goods and services. At the moment, businesses and the government are sucking demand out of the economy. In the autumn statement, the chancellor extended austerity into a third parliament, with cuts to disability payments and tax credits. His message was that a boost to infrastructure spending would compensate by creating thousands of well-paid jobs in areas such as engineering, science and construction. Last week Robert Chote, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), took a sword to this narrative and killed it stone dead. He said Hammond\u2019s plans to boost infrastructure spending with a \u00a323bn \u201cnational productivity investment fund\u201d failed to move the dial on its forecasts. \u201cThis is not the near-term fiscal stimulus package that some people either expected or feared or wanted,\u201d Chote said in testimony to the Treasury select committee. \u201cIt\u2019s a relatively small, gradually phased increase.\u201d He added that it minimised one of the main boasts for infrastructure spending \u2013 a \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d that sends out ripples of extra work to suppliers and services companies that in turn increase investment and employment. An example of how feeble the infrastructure package is likely to prove was given last week by the tax adviser George Bull of accountant RSM. He was talking of Hammond\u2019s planned 100% capital allowance for companies investing in electric car charging points, and investment of \u00a380m to expand the charging infrastructure. Bull, who describes the move to increase the number of electric vehicles on UK roads as \u201cgloriously inconsistent\u201d with the government\u2019s reduction last year in subsidies for renewable electricity generators, asked who would benefit from this extra tax relief and how much it would be worth. HMRC\u2019s answer was: \u201cIn practice it [the new tax relief] impacts only on those businesses with qualifying plant and machinery expenditure above the level of the annual investment allowance of \u00a3200,000.\u201d \u201cIn other words,\u201d said Bull, \u201cvery few businesses. And the cost to the exchequer, according to HMRC, is negligible. \u201cSo here we have a new tax relief which can\u2019t be used by many businesses, which will hardly cost the exchequer a penny, but which seems inconsistent with the government\u2019s broader policy on renewable energy.\u201d The Institute for Fiscal Studies looked at another autumn statement initiative \u2013 the government plan to extend free childcare for three- and four-year-olds in England from 15 to 30 hours a week \u2013 and asked whether it was likely to boost parental employment. The answer was: \u201cOnly slightly.\u201d So it would leave demand in the economy little changed. Demand can also be affected by business investment growth, which the OBR expects will falter as the Brexit vote debate gets into full swing. It all makes for a bleak picture when low inflation expectations rely on weak consumer spending, low business investment, an autumn statement that can only be described as a non-event and the odd ministerial comment hinting at a softer Brexit.",

      "bodyText": "\u2018All Italians know the government has a problem when it comes to making decisions. It\u2019s just that people are divided over how to make the situation better.\u201d So said one Italian government official last week as he denied that Sunday\u2019s referendum was a verdict on Matteo Renzi\u2019s government, the euro or the European Union. Unfortunately, the referendum has become a judgment on all three, along with the constitutional amendments it is supposed to be about, making it difficult to unpick the views of voters when all the votes are finally counted. No wonder unofficial polling put the number of undecided voters going into the weekend at 6 million, which is a huge number of undecideds when around 12 million votes will probably win the day. Prime minister Renzi is desperate to win, not only to avoid triggering his promise to resign if he loses, but also to push through legislation that has spent much of the last couple of years trundling back and forth between the lower house of deputies and the upper house, the senate. Both have equal status and reject each other\u2019s legislative initiatives. The proposed constitutional changes would demote the senate to being a body of 100 members appointed by regional leaders who can discuss regional matters and have oversight of changes to Italy\u2019s relationship with Brussels. No longer, says Renzi, will attempts to liberalise high street chemists and usher in competition get stuck in the system for two years while senators and deputies with equal status cry foul. Senators will have a different job. There are economists and business leaders who describe the reforms as crucial to Italy\u2019s ability to claw its way back to health. Its industrial output is some 10% smaller than it was in 2007 and the unemployment rate stands at twice its pre-crash level, at 13% (the UK\u2019s is 4.8%). Others believe the reforms are a distraction from dealing with the collapse in manufacturing, and rescuing a banking sector that needs a massive injection of funds. Beppe Grillo, the leader of the radical Five Star Movement, together with the virulently right-of-centre Northern League, form the most vocal opposition, and have done their utmost to make the referendum a verdict on the euro and Brussels. A No vote can only help their cause in bringing a referendum on Italian membership of the eurozone nearer. Few people believe the reforms are the best way to bring about more effective government, but they understand it took a great deal of wrangling to even arrive at a compromise package, and that what is on the table is unlikely to be available for a long time. There is a silver lining to a No vote. Renzi could be persuaded by the president to form another government with a view to tackling the electoral system. Before elections that must be held in 2018, he could produce a system that recognises the need for a winner from Italy\u2019s three main political blocs, including Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s old party, Forza Italia. If so, a clear winner would solve many of the country\u2019s problems. The government could also make strides to shore up the banking sector, which needs around $40bn by most estimates, to offset the mounting losses from decades of bad loans. Monte dei Paschi, Italy\u2019s third-largest bank, needs to raise \u20ac5bn of equity and sell off \u20ac28bn of bad loans. Long ago, Italians might have swallowed their pride and tipped all the non-performing loans into a bad bank. Now they are paying JP Morgan to construct a more complicated vehicle. That\u2019s not ideal either \u2013 but it\u2019s probably more important to get this right than switch around the constitution. Privatised rail\u2019s fundamental flaw The annual, inexorable rise in rail fares is traditionally accompanied by train company representatives taking a ritual kicking on the airwaves, while angry passengers fume over the extra money they will have to shell out for the dubious pleasure of getting to work. Sometimes, train operators merit a smidgen of sympathy when they point out that most fare rises are dictated by ministers. But while regulated fares, set by government to match July\u2019s RPI inflation figure, will rise 1.9%, last week\u2019s figures showed that the overall increase in January will be 2.3%. Certain operators \u2013 most notably Virgin Trains, on the east coast route that was last year still in public hands \u2013 have chosen to drive even harder, adding a whopping 5.5% on average to the fares they control. Given current inflation rates, Virgin\u2019s fare rise should justly provoke anger. But the reasons behind it should also bring concern, from supporters of privatised rail as much as anyone else. The increase comes as Virgin\u2019s east coast operation attempts to keep pace with premium payments \u2013 fare revenues handed to the government \u2013 that are due to rise 23%, on plan to deliver a cumulative \u00a33.3bn to the Treasury by 2023. Other firms who have eyed franchises are aghast at the scale of winning bids, and the Department for Transport has had to reassure the industry that it does not expect such sums again, as it struggles to keep enough participants to make the battered franchising system viable. Virgin\u2019s immediate problem on the east coast is that passenger growth is much lower than predicted. Few would weep to see a dent in the profits of the joint venture between Stagecoach and Richard Branson; but the recent history of this franchise is littered with private firms, from Sea Containers\u2019 GNER to National Express, throwing back the keys when the going got tough. Virgin\u2019s solution appears to be a renewed squeeze on the travelling public. One way or another, the riches that the DfT anticipated for the right to run the lucrative London-Edinburgh route might yet prove to be more fool\u2019s gold. No festive advertising bounce Turns out that trampolining dogs, calamitous cats and skating yetis don\u2019t make us buy more stuff. Christmas does. That was the message from a survey of 11,500 consumers into Christmas TV adverts by MoneySavingExpert.com. Despite retailers\u2019 claims that their seasonal tearjerkers pull in the punters, just 1% of those polled said the campaigns had a \u201cbig impact\u201d on where they shopped. A further 2% said they had \u201can impact\u201d, and a crushing 69% said they had no impact whatsoever. It would seem the likes of John Lewis and Sainsbury\u2019s have become too subtle for their own good. A not insignificant 6% of people said they liked some of the adverts but could never remember who they were for, while 9% said they were \u201cturned off\u201d by the ads and deliberately avoided the stores behind them. And yet, retailers are spending more than ever before on the great festive push, making ad agencies the real winners this Christmas.",

      "bodyText": "Xiao Fang thinks she\u2019s one of the luckier workers making Barbie dolls for the Christmas market at the Mattel toy factory in Chang\u2019an. True, she says, she works 11-hour days, six days a week, and shares a dormitory with nine other women and gets to see her husband only once a week. She had to leave her three-year-old daughter back home in Sichuan. And there is only a communal bathroom, and if they want hot water they must fetch it from another floor. But at least she has a job, she says. And others have it worse. Xiao is one of thousands of workers in Chinese factories making some of this year\u2019s must-have Christmas toys. An investigation with the US-based NGO China Labor Watch reveals that toys including Barbie, Thomas the Tank Engine and Hot Wheels were made by staff earning as little as 86p an hour. Overtime can run to nearly three times the legal limit. In some factories \u2013 including one producing Happy Meal toys for McDonald\u2019s from the new DreamWorks movie Trolls \u2013 that means some are on 12-hour shifts and have to work with hazardous chemicals. According to China Labor Watch, the world of toys may be heaven for children, but it is a world of misery for toy factory workers. The group\u2019s founder and executive director, Li Qiang, said: \u201cWe can\u2019t tolerate that children\u2019s dreams are based on workers\u2019 nightmares, and we must fight against the unfair oppression of workers who manufacture toys.\u201d Undercover investigators infiltrated four factories, and the group shared wage slips and pictures with the Observer to support their findings. The investigators said that they found workers making toys in factories supplying Disney, Mattel, Fisher-Price and McDonald\u2019s who reported having to do more than 100 hours of overtime a month \u2013 nearly three times the legal limit in China. But the toy industry\u2019s own watchdog, the ICTI Care Foundation, says it is powerless to stop many Chinese factories breaking the law on overtime. \u201cThe reality is, across the board, most factories, or the vast majority at least, work way beyond legal limits in China, and legal limits are almost universally ignored,\u201d said Mark Robertson, ICTI Care\u2019s director of communications. \u201cOur position is, we want transparency. We want to know how many hours are worked in the factories, so we can make sure workers are paid for every minute that they work.\u201d Some of this year\u2019s must-have brands were made in the factories visited by the undercover team. At the Foshan Nanhai Diecast Company factory the basic salary for workers was just 86p an hour. Toys photographed inside the factory included Thomas the Tank Engine Minis and Hot Wheels Guardians of the Galaxy, as well as the Cars Piston Cup racing garage and the Fisher-Price Learn with Me Zebra Walker. Fisher-Price is owned by Mattel. Working all available overtime and with all allowances and deductions applied, a worker takes home far less than the average wage in Chinese cities of \u00a3715 a month. An undercover investigator who joined the company as a worker described having to work with isoamyl acetate \u2013 commonly know as banana oil \u2013 which can soften and dissolve plastics. The investigator worked on a production line and came into direct contact with the substance, reporting that some workers had complained to management about the strong odour. Staff also claimed that the company offered prizes for the three most productive workers every day. The prize was a pack of paper towels. At the Chang\u2019an Toy factory, investigators photographed toys from Mattel\u2019s Monster High range of dolls and spoke to workers who said that they made the company\u2019s Barbie dolls. A large pink Barbie banner hangs on the outside of the building. The factory employs about 4,200 people, and workers again claimed they worked more than 100 hours a month overtime at peak periods, starting on a base wage of \u00a31.08 an hour. The basic monthly wage was \u00a3188 and the maximum take-home pay after overtime, allowances and deductions was \u00a3337. The investigators said that the average working week was 68.3 hours. Chinese labour law allows a maximum of only 36 overtime hours a month. A worker averaging 68.3 hours a week would be working an average 88 hours of overtime a month \u2013 but workers claimed the figure was higher during peak production periods over the summer. At the Combine Will factory in Dongguang, which employs about 2,700 people, investigators photographed toys being manufactured for McDonald\u2019s Happy Meals, including Hello Kitty toys and Trolls pencil toppers based on characters from the DreamWorks film. The investigators interviewed workers in the cutting section, who said they sometimes clocked up 100 hours of overtime a month. They also found that the inside of the building could get as hot as 31C. Wages started at \u00a31.08 an hour and some workers say they were expected to work with banana oil and isopropyl alcohol, which can cause dizziness and even death in high concentrations. The basic wage for a five-day week was \u00a3189 a month, with the upper limit of take-home pay about \u00a3337. However, some workers on piece rate were able to earn as much as \u00a3482 a month. In the Shenzhen Wei Lee Fung Plastic Products Co factory, investigators photographed Fisher-Price Imaginext DC Super Friends toys \u2013 including Batman \u2013 along with Disney Princess dolls and toys from the Fisher-Price Little People range. The factory employs about 2,000 workers, who reported that they started on a basic wage of \u00a31.16 an hour and claimed they were expected to work more than 100 hours of overtime. An investigator joining the company undercover was required to sign a statement promising to accept any punishment handed out. China Labor Watch\u2019s Li Qiang accused the toy companies of exploiting Chinese workers. He said: \u201cWorkers in toy factories face heavy workloads every day, but only earn an extremely low wage. They have children as well. \u201cThose who earn high profits from toys have done so by oppressing the interests of workers, and as such their negligence should be subject to public and moral condemnation.\u201d A spokesman for McDonald\u2019s said: \u201cAs purchasers of toys from Combine Will, we take these allegations very seriously. We are committed to ensuring fair and ethical workplace standards in every corner of our supply chain. \u201cWe are working closely with ICTI Care in its investigation as well as overseeing a thorough review of these allegations, and will swiftly and effectively address any issues that are identified.\u201d A Mattel spokesman said: \u201cMattel is committed to ensuring every single person making our toys and products is treated fairly, with respect and is able to work in a safe and healthy environment. Our labour standards, environmental, health and safety programmes and oversight processes reflect this commitment, and we stand behind our record of ethical labour practices and environmental stewardship. \u201cWe are devoted to ensuring that our manufacturing facilities throughout the world are safe and ethical places to work, and we reject any suggestion to the contrary.\u201d Disney referred requests for comment to ICTI Care. Its director, Mark Robertson, said the organisation took the accusations \u201cextremely seriously\u201d and promised a \u201crobust investigation\u201d. He said standards in the industry were improving and the wellbeing of factory workers was the \u201ccore priority\u201d. The Toy Retailers Association said it would work with the industry to tackle the issues raised by the investigation. A spokesman said: \u201cThe Toy Retailers Association views the China Labor Watch report with concern, which we know is shared throughout the industry. \u201cOur members are conscientious retailers who abide by a code of ethics with regard to where and how they purchase toys, which includes compliance with all UK, European and wider standards.\u201d",
