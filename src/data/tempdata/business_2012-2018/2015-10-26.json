      "bodyText": "An Air France executive who was forced to flee shirtless from a staff meeting after he was attacked by protesting workers has described his ordeal as \u201cthe price to pay for democracy\u201d. Xavier Broseta, the airline\u2019s vice president of human resources, was pushed to safety over a fence \u2013 minus his shirt and jacket \u2013 at the airline\u2019s offices in Paris on 5 October after 100 workers angered by a redundancy programme forced their way into a meeting of the airline\u2019s senior management. Broseta, who has received more than 1,000 messages of support from around the world, including from French trade unions, said: \u201cIt is sometimes the price to pay for democracy \u2026 and we have to get used to the fact that the world is crazy.\u201d The executive said in an interview with newspaper Le Parisien that he bore no grudges, despite an attack that saw him and Pierre Plissonnier, vice-president of the airline\u2019s Orly airport hub, escape with their clothes torn to shreds. However, Broseta said he was still smarting from the experience, adding that he would never watch the video footage from the day when he was \u201cthe face of France, but what a face\u201d. He said: \u201cCertain acts are just not admissible.\u201d Broseta confirmed an injured security guard, who lost consciousness for a few minutes after he was throttled in the melee, has left hospital but has not returned to work. Six Air France workers have been arrested in relation to the attacks. Air France workers had stormed a meeting of the airline\u2019s works council aimed at finalising a restructuring plan involving 2,900 redundancies by 2017. The proposed job losses involve 1,700 ground staff, 900 cabin crew and 300 pilots. Undaunted by his experience earlier in the month, Broseta insisted that the carrier needed to reduce costs and warned that Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary could afford to buy Air France as easily as he can buy a pack of cigarettes. He said: \u201cEvery airline in the world has lower costs than ours. If we are not strong enough, we shall be gobbled up.\u201d If the pilots and then the cabin and ground staff accepted the latest proposals, this would \u201creduce the number of job cuts\u201d, and create a \u201cvirtuous dynamic\u201d that would lead to further recruitment fairly quickly. A French opinion poll found that the majority of French people surveyed said they could understand the workers\u2019 violence, even if they did not approve of it. Poll findings divided along predictable lines, with company bosses less sympathetic. French political leaders, including the president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, described the violence as unacceptable.",

An advisory body funded by British meat producers said the key to preventing cancer was avoiding heavy drinking, not smoking and maintaining a healthy weight. \u201cRed and processed meats do not give you cancer,\u201d said Robert Pickard, a member of the Meat Advisory Panel and emeritus professor of neurobiology at the University of Cardiff. \u201cAvoiding red meat in the diet is not a protective strategy against cancer,\u201d he added. \u201cThe top priorities for cancer prevention remain smoking cessation, maintenance of normal body weight and avoidance of high-alcohol intakes. Red meat has a valuable role within a healthy, balanced diet thanks to its high-protein content and rich nutritional composition.\u201d The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, which is funded by the farming industry, played down the report\u2019s findings. Maureen Strong, the nutrition manager for the AHDB, said: \u201cThe International Agency for Research on Cancer isn\u2019t saying red and processed meat as part of a balanced diet causes cancer: no single food causes cancer. Nor is it saying it is as dangerous as smoking ... the IARC itself has said that the risk from processed meat remains small.\u201d The review by the IARC, the WHO\u2019s cancer research arm, put processed meat in its group 1 list, which includes tobacco and asbestos as categories for which there is \u201csufficient evidence\u201d of cancer links. Red meat was in the report\u2019s group 2A list. The National Farmers\u2019 Union said the scientific and medical communities have backed red meat consumption at recommended quantities as beneficial to health. Meurig Raymond, the NFU president, said: \u201cThe NFU has always stated that eating lean red meat has an important role to play in a healthy balanced diet. It\u2019s a traditional part of the British lifestyle and is enjoyed by most of the population,.\u201d One British meat producer, Charles Baughan, owner of Westaways Sausages in Devon, dismissed the report. \u201cI\u2019ve just finished eating some Hog\u2019s pudding and I\u2019m not the slightest bit concerned about my health,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a certain scepticism about reports like the one produced by the World Health Organisation.\u201d Referring to relatives who have run the family-owned firm previously, he said: \u201cMany of them have lived into their 90s and I don\u2019t think any of them have had cancer.\u201d Westaways, which produces 500,000 sausages per week, believes the report will not curb the public\u2019s appetite for red and processed meats. Meanwhile, shares in Cranswick, a sausage-skin manufacturer, were trading broadly unchanged as investors counted on the public retaining their appetite for bacon, sausages and ham.",

The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 27.06 points or 0.42% at 6417.02 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.06% to 10,801.34 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.54% lower at 4897.13 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 0.47% to 22,629.64 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended virtually unchanged, up 0.02% at 10,478.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.78% to 718.04 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 22 points or 013%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. France has reported one of the biggest falls in its jobless numbers since before the financial crisis began. The number of people out of work fell by 23,800 in September to 3,547,800. This was down 0.7% month on month, but up 3.1% on a year earlier. The number of jobless young people dropped for the fourth month in a row. In the UK, TalkTalk shares have slumped more than 12% in the wake of last week\u2019s cyber attack on the company. Since the news was announced that the attack could have led to the theft of personal data from its 4m customers, some \u00a3360m has now been wiped off the company\u2019s value. This was the third data breach to hit the company this year, with investors fearing the attacks would do serious damage to its reputation. The company could also face compensation claims from customers who have been affected by the data breach. Despite some differences and more work needing to be done, Greece and its creditors are making progress in talks to allow the country to receive its next batch of bailout funds, Associated Press reported: Greece and its bailout creditors remain divided over how to toughen foreclosure laws, a European Union official said Monday, though the overall talks on getting the country the next batch of loans are on track. Valdis Dombrovskis, a European Commission vice-president for the euro, said Greece has already done many reforms, quickly. But he warned \u201cthere is no time to lose. There is a need to work very actively to modernize the Greek state and economy.\u201d Greece has committed to broad reforms, savings and tax hikes to secure its third bailout package from its European partners. Bailout creditors are currently reviewing the government\u2019s compliance with the measures they had agreed upon before paying the country a \u20ac2bn loan installment. Greece is under pressure to lower the income and wealth criteria based on which non-compliant borrowers\u2019 primary residences enjoy protection. Dombrovskis and the Greek government officials he met in Athens at the start of a two-day visit agreed that differences remain on the issue of foreclosures. About 40% of all Greek bank loans are now in serious arrears, as successive income cuts over more than five years have left borrowers struggling to repay. At the heart of the issue are housing loans. The left-led government says it wants protection for borrowers whose homes are worth up to \u20ac300,000, and who earn up to \u20ac35,000 a year, about 75% of those affected. It says the creditors\u2019 counter-proposal protection for homes worth up to \u20ac120,000 would expose nearly 80% of borrowers to the threat of foreclosure. Dombrovskis said the Commission wants protection limited to households that \u201cclearly\u201d need it. \u201cBut there is a clear willingness (on) both sides to find a compromise,\u201d he added. Government spokeswoman Olga Gerovassili said Athens will fight \u201call the way\u201d to prevent an explosion in foreclosures. Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy has called a general election for 20 December, in the hope that a recovery in the economy would see his party returned to power. Associated Press reports: Rajoy said he had fulfilled a promise made on taking office in 2011 by reducing sky-high unemployment and spurring economic growth. He said the country had gone from being threatened with needing a bailout to one of full confidence among investors and from record unemployment to a situation of job creation. The ruling Popular Party hopes the recovery will boost its electoral fortunes but polls indicate the party is running neck and neck with the opposition Socialist party and could lose its parliamentary majority. The polls indicate one of the two main parties will have to do a deal with one of the two newcomers, the centrist Ciudadanos (Citizens) party or the far-left Podemos (We Can) group. Global markets are edging lower, with the weak US home sales dampening sentiment. But the real market moving events come later in the week. Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell said: It is likely that today is a mere moment of respite between last week\u2019s market-moving announcements from the European Central Bank and the People\u2019s Bank of China and the wave of important figures and earnings releases still to come before October ends (including the mid-week peak of the latest Federal Open Market Committee statement). On Tuesday alone there is the preliminary third quarter GDP number for the UK, US consumer confidence and durable goods figures and arguably the most anticipated release of the entire earnings season in the form of Apple\u2019s fourth quarter results. The Bank of England will not raise rates until the second quarter of next year, according to a poll of economists by Reuters. This is later than previously thought: two weeks ago in a similar poll, economists believed a rate rise would come in the first quarter. In this latest survey, the median forecast from nearly 60 economists was for the Bank to raise borrowing costs in April, and even then it is expected to be only a 25 basis point rise. The economists pushed back their forecasts since UK inflation remained stubbornly lower than the Bank\u2019s target. More mixed US data. The Dallas Fed manufacturing index of business activity for October has come in at -12.7, compared to -9.5 in September and forecasts of an improvement to -6.5. But some other indices in the survey moved moved higher. The production index, which the Fed calls \u201ca key measure of state manufacturing conditions\u201d, rose from 0.9 in September to 4.8, the first month of output growth this year. The home sales figures have helped push Wall Street lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 30 points. There are signs that the US housing market may be cooling off. New single-family home sales fell 11.5% to a near one year low in September after two months of gains, according to the US Commerce Department. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of 468,000 units was the lowest level since November 2014 and well below expectations of 550,000. August\u2019s figure of 552,000 was revised down to 529,000. New homes in the northeast slumped by 61.8% to the lowest level since April. Even if the decline proves temporary, it provides another piece of downbeat evidence for the US Federal Reserve to ponder as it considers whether to raise interest rates this year. Worries about the US government reaching its debt ceiling if Congress does not vote to raise it seem overdone, according to ratings agency Moody\u2019s. In a new report it said: Failure to raise the US government\u2019s statutory debt limit before the Treasury has exhausted the \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d that it is using to fund the government\u2019s spending, does not mean that the US is about to default on its debt. US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew told Congress earlier this month that the government will have exhausted the measures in place to fund the government by, or around, November 3. Without an agreement to raise the statutory debt limit by then, the Treasury will be forced to begin cutting expenditures to ensure that its spending matches its income. Moody\u2019s expects that an agreement to raise the debt limit will be in place before the measures are exhausted, and if not by then, certainly before November 15, when the Treasury is scheduled to make interests payments of $35 billion. If an agreement is still not in place by this time, the government could delay other expenditures to ensure it has enough cash to pay bondholders. \u201cEven if the debt limit is not raised, we believe the government will order its payment priorities to allow the Treasury to continue servicing its debt obligations,\u201d says Moody\u2019s Senior Vice President Steven Hess. However, the risk that Congress will fail to raise the debt limit in time to prevent this scenario is small, Moody\u2019s says in a report entitled \u201cDebt Limit Deadline Next Week Does Not Imply Debt Default.\u201d In the unlikely event that an agreement is not reached, Moody\u2019s estimates that total government expenditures would have to be reduced by an average of 11 percent during the fiscal year 2016, so that it can run a balanced cash position. However, on a month-to-month basis, the pattern of revenues and expenditures varies considerably, with five months of the year recording surpluses, while the other months are in deficit. November typically records a fairly large deficit, meaning that during that month expenditures would have to be cut by a larger US markets have opened virtually unchanged, with investors remaining cautious ahead of the latest US Federal Reserve meeting this week. Almost no one expects any movement on interest rates this month - there is no scheduled press conference for a start. But economists will be looking for clues about the Fed\u2019s current thinking as to whether it will move at the December meeting. That debate still seems finely balanced. Markets are also a little hesitant ahead of a big week for technology company results, including Apple. So the Dow Jones Industrial is currently down just 9 points. Shortly there are new US home sales and the latest Dallas Fed manufacturing survey. Time for a very quick recap: UK factories have suffered their biggest drop in export orders since 2012. Economists are blaming the strength of the pound, and weakness in emerging markets. Germany is shrugging off the impact of the Volkswagen scandal. Although business conditions deteriorated this month, executives say they are more optimistic about future prospects. VW has lost its crown as the world\u2019s biggest carmaker, by sales, to Toyota. It\u2019s been a subdued morning\u2019s trading in Europe, where China\u2019s interest rate cut has failed to spur much euphoria. The FTSE 100 is now flat, while France\u2019s CAC is slightly lower. Investors are watching the latest Communist Party Plenum meeting. Officials will lay out a new five-year plan - and perhaps accept that the target of 7% growth can\u2019t be sustained. As FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga puts it: The Chinese five year plan, which is currently being formulated by China\u2019s top leadership, may play down growth targets for 2016-2020, since despite the vigorous efforts of the government the Chinese economy has failed to pick up. Elsewhere in the City.... Shares in UK telecoms firm TalkTalk have slid by 9% after it was hacked. Advertising giant WPP lost almost 2%. It warned that business leaders are rather risk averse right now, faced with geopolitical tensions and rising competition from tech upstarts and activists investors. While in the eurozone, Portuguese bond yields are rising after the country\u2019s president ushered the centre-right party back into power. Alexander Aldinger, senior analyst at Bayerische Landesbank, explains: \u201cThe uncertainty whether the proposed minority government will be tolerated by the parliament had a negative impact on the country\u2019s bonds.\u201d Portuguese government bonds are coming under some pressure today as investors react to the unfolding political crisis in Lisbon. While most eurozone bonds have strengthened today, Portugal has gone the other way, pushing up the yield (or interest rate) on its 10-year debt from 2.37% to 2.45%. The move came after opposition parties vowed to bring down Portugal\u2019s new government in a confidence vote later this week. They\u2019re furious that the centre-right coalition, led by former PM Pedro Passos Coelho, has been invited to form another administration despite failing to win a majority in this month\u2019s election. In taking this decision, Portugal\u2019s president Cavaco Silva has enraged some certain commentators who argue that he\u2019s \u201cbanned\u201d the Portuguese left-wing a fair crack at power in a massive failure for democracy. It\u2019s a complicated situation, though. No party won an overall majority, although Passos Coelho\u2019s group came first with 38% of the vote. The socialists came second with 32% followed by the hard left Left Bloc with 10% and the communists with 7%. Those three left-wing parties *could* form a majority, but instead president Silva passed the mandate to Passos Coelho. Crucially, and controversially, he also warned that the far-left parties\u2019 anti-EU views were a threat to Portugal. Enough of a threat to block them from power?! It\u2019s certainly a mess. But politics lecturer Chris Hanretty has written a good blogpost here, explaining why talk of a coup in Portugal is a little simplistic. He says: Often, there is no right or obvious answer to the question, \u201cwho won the election?\u201d. But if Cavaco Silva\u2019s decision is wrong, then it will be righted automatically by the actions of Parliament in less than a fortnight\u2019s time. If that happens, the alarmists will have been proven wrong. Unfortunately, attention will likely have moved on. Sam Tombs of consultancy firm Pantheon Macroeconomic fears that UK factories will continue to struggle because of the strong pound. He\u2019s created a chart showing how exports fall after the the pound strengthens (the inverted left-hand scale, shifted forwards nine months). And that correlation means factory orders could continue to weaken, Tombs explains: The chart shows that the worst is not over for the manufacturing sector; sterling\u2019s further appreciation over the last year will continue to depress export orders until mid-2016, at least. IHS economist Howard Archer is alarmed by the drop in UK factory orders reported by the CBI: This is a thoroughly disappointing survey through and through which indicates that manufacturers\u2019 struggles are intensifying as a moderation in domestic demand adds to a still weakening export outlook. Persistent and seemingly deepening manufacturing weakness is very worrying for hopes that UK growth can ultimately become more balanced and less dependent on the services sector and consumer spending. More signs that UK manufacturers are having a tough time as they contend with China\u2019s downturn and a stronger pound. The latest survey of factory bosses by business group CBI suggests orders have dropped from both within the UK and outside. The report\u2019s key order book balance is the weakest for more than two years. This does not bode well for official GDP figures due on Tuesday that will give the first snapshot of UK growth in the third quarter. The consensus forecast is for quarterly growth of 0.6% in the July-September period, down from 0.7% in the second quarter, according to a Reuters poll. The CBI\u2019s report suggests that in the three months to October new export orders fell at the fastest pace in three years. That was possibly down to the continued strength of the pound, which makes UK goods more expensive to overseas buyers, the CBI said. Total new domestic orders fell over the quarter for the first time since April 2013. Manufacturing production also edged downwards during the three months to October, marking the first decline in the last two years, according to the CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey. Against that backdrop, manufacturers\u2019 optimism about both their business situation and export prospects for the year ahead fell at the fastest pace since October 2012, according to the poll of 463 companies. But they predicted that overall manufacturing conditions will stabilise in the next three months, with a small rise in output. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI director of economics, says UK manufacturers are being buffeted at home and abroad. \u201cManufacturers have been struggling with weak export demand for several months, because of the strength of the pound and subdued global growth. But now they\u2019re also facing pressure back home as domestic demand is easing.\u201d And here are the key figures from the report: 22% of businesses reported an increase in total new order books and 30% a decrease, giving a balance of -8%, the lowest since October 2012. 20% of businesses reported an increase in domestic orders, with 31% noting a decrease. The balance for domestic orders (-11%) was below the long-run average (-5%), the lowest since April 2013 (-14%). 15% reported an increase in export orders, with 33% signalling a decrease. The resulting balance for export orders (-17%) signalled a faster decrease in orders than the historic average (-7%). This marks the lowest rate since October 2012 (-17%). Germany\u2019s central bank reckons that the country\u2019s economy remains \u201cquite strong\u201d, despite signs that growth slowed in the last three months. Former hedge fund boss Magnus Peterson has just been banned from the City, over one of the biggest rogue trading scandals of recent years. Peterson\u2019s Weavering Macro Fixed Income Fund collapsed in 2009, costing investors around \u00a3350m. It had been marketed as a safe and secure investment, which investors could easily reclaim their funds from. But once the financial crisis struck, Peterson embarked on a series of risky wagers on financial derivatives which failed to reverse its fortunes. He was convicted of several counts of fraud, after the high court heard how he had taken out $600m of swap contracts, which turned out to be worthless, with another company under his control. Mark Steward, director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, says Peterson has been banned to protect consumer and markets. \u201cMr Peterson defrauded investors who should have been able to trust him. Over a prolonged period he purposely used investors\u2019 money to prop up his business, and then lied in order to cover up his deception.\u201d This makes little practical difference to Peterson, aged 51, right now, as he was jailed for 13 years in January. Back in the City, UK telecoms group TalkTalk is the biggest faller on the stock market after suffering a major cybercrime attack last week. TalkTalk shares have slumped by around 9.5% this morning. Last week, the firm admitted that customers\u2019 personal and financial details could have been stolen by cybercriminals who breached its security systems. TalkTalk boss Dido Harding told my colleague Josh Halliday last night that it\u2019s too early to say if the company will compensate those affected. She also argued that TalkTalk\u2019s security was better than its rivals, despite the breach: \u201cNobody is perfect. God knows, we\u2019ve just demonstrated that our website security wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 I\u2019m not going to pretend it is \u2013 but we take it incredibly seriously. \u201cOn that specific vulnerability, it\u2019s much better than it was and we are head and shoulders better than some of our competitors and some of the media bodies that were throwing those particular stones.\u201d And despite criticism from shareholders, Harding is determined to hold onto her job: IFO economist Klaus Wohlrabe has confirmed that Germany\u2019s auto industry is shrugging off the revelations that VW deliberately cheated on emissions tests. Speaking to Reuters about today\u2019s IFO report, Wohlrabe pointed out that business expectations and the assessment of current conditions in the sector had both improved this month. That helped to push IFO\u2019s measure of business confidence higher this month, from 103.3 to 103.8. Wohlrabe says: The German automobile industry appears to be unfazed by the VW scandal. German business leaders aren\u2019t frightened by the crisis at Volkswagen, and the slowdown in emerging markets, explains Carsten Brzeski of ING. Here\u2019s his analysis on today\u2019s IFO report: Surprised but not frightened? German businesses showed an interesting reaction to the recent series of uncertainties and turmoil. In fact, the reaction can be summarized as impressed but not frightened. Germany\u2019s most prominent leading indicator, the just released Ifo index dropped to 108.2 in October, from 108.5 in September. The first drop since June this year. Interestingly, the drop was exclusively driven by a weaker assessment of the current situation. The expectation component, on the other side, increased to 103.8, from 103.3, continuing its recent positive trend and actually reaching the highest level since June last year. Of course, one should not interpret too much in a single confidence indicator but today\u2019s Ifo reading suggests that the German business community is filing the Volkswagen scandal as a one-off and also shrugs off the risk from a possible Chinese and emerging markets slowdown. Despite these external uncertainties and regular concerns about the real strength of the German economy, German business remain highly optimistic. There are two possible explanations for this trend: either German businesses are naive optimists or ice-cold realists, sticking to the facts. In our view, there are many arguments in favour of the latter. The euro is slightly higher following the IFO survey: Today\u2019s German business confidence survey shows Europe\u2019s powerhouse economy remains in decent health, say City experts. Economist Frederik Ducrozet is encouraged by the rise in business expectation this month: Die Welt\u2019s Holger Zschaepitz points out that confidence in the German carmaking industry rose this month: Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi points out that demand within Germany is still robust: Business conditions in Germany have fallen this month, according to the latest survey of corporate confidence in Europe\u2019s latest economy. The IFO thinktank has just reported that current conditions in the German economy have deteriorated this month, for the first time in four months. But IFO also found that business leaders are more upbeat about future prospects than in September. That suggests the VW emissions scandal has not caused major trauma. IFO\u2019s business climate index fell to 108.2 in October, down from 108.5 in September, but rather higher than expected. The current conditions index fell to 112.6, from 114 a month ago. That suggests that business leaders are finding life a bit harder -- after seeing exports and factory orders deteriorate over the summer. But the expectations index rose to 103.8, from 103.3, indicating that Germany PLC expects to ride out the slowdown in China and other emerging markets, and the Volkswagen saga. I\u2019ll mop up some reaction now... Speaking of carmakers...Japan\u2019s Toyota has overtaken Germany\u2019s Volkswagen to become the world\u2019s largest carmaker. Toyota has reported that it sold almost 7.5 million cars in the third quarter of 2015, while VW sold 7.43m. Does that show that the diesel emissions scandal has hurt VW? Not really -- that news only broke in mid-September, giving little opportunity for it to show up in these figures. But it does show that VW may already have been finding life tougher, even before admitting that around 11 million vehicles were sold with software to trick emissions tests. Shares in French carmaker Peugeot are down 2% this morning, after reporting a 4.4% drop in sales in China and South East Asia. That took the shine off a 3.8% rise in sales in Europe. Advertising titan WPP is among the biggest fallers in London, down around 2%, despite reporting a 3.3% rise in net sales in the last six months. Traders may be discouraged by a warning that \u201crisk averse\u201d business leaders are reluctant to stick their necks out too far, given the current geopolitical tensions. WPP told shareholders that: Country specific slowdowns in China and Brazil and geopolitical issues remain top of business leaders\u2019 concerns. The continuing crisis in the Ukraine and consequent bilateral sanctions, principally affecting Russia, continued tensions in the Middle East and North Africa and the risk of possible exits from the European Community, driven by further political and economic trouble in Greece, top the agenda. Corporate bosses are also facing a two-pronged squeeze -- from new technology rivals on one side, and cost-cutting activists on the other, WPP added: If you are trying to run a legacy business, at one end of the spectrum you have the disrupters like Uber and Airbnb and at the other end you have the cost-focused models like 3G in fast moving consumer goods, and Valeant and Endo in pharmaceuticals, whilst in the middle, hovering above you, you have the activists led by such as Nelson Peltz, Bill Ackman and Dan Loeb, emphasising short-term performance. Not surprising then, that corporate leaders tend to be risk averse. As predicted, Europe\u2019s stock markets have fallen into the red this morning. The FTSE 100 has shed arounds 33 points, or 0.5%, as Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct, explains: It has been a surprisingly muted overnight session in Asia with markets showing little reaction to Friday\u2019s rate cut news out of China. London\u2019s FTSE-100 is failing to find any inspiration off the back of the news either, with the vast majority of stocks mired in red ink shortly after the open. The other main markets are also down, apart from Germany\u2019s DAX which is flat. Mining and energy stocks are generally lower, showing that concerns over global growth haven\u2019t gone away. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The FTSE, falling by around 25 points soon after the bell, was weighed down by (what else?) its mining and oil stocks, with investors seemingly less sure about the Chinese rate cut than they were last Friday By cutting interest rates, China\u2019s central bank risks creating further instability in a global economy that is already hooked on ultra-cheap money and regular hits of stimulus. As our economic editor Larry Elliott explains, such stimulus measures may already be less effective too: Problem number one is that by deliberately weakening their exchange rates, countries are stealing growth from each other. Central banks insist that this does not represent a return to the competitive devaluations and protectionism of the 1930s, but it is starting to look awfully like it. Problem number two is that the monetary stimulus is becoming less and less effective over time. There are two main channels through which QE operates. One is through the exchange rate, but the policy doesn\u2019t work if all countries want a cheaper currency at once. Then, as the weakness of global trade testifies, it is simply robbing Peter to pay Paul. The other channel is through long-term interest rates, which are linked to the price of bonds. When central banks buy bonds, they reduce the available supply and drive up the price. Interest rates (the yield) on bonds move in the opposite direction to the price, so a higher price means borrowing is cheaper for businesses, households and governments. But when bond yields are already at historic lows, it is hard to drive them much lower even with large dollops of QE. In Keynes\u2019s immortal words, central banks are pushing on a piece of string.... Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s full analysis on the rate cut: Copper, a classic measure of the health of the global economy, hasn\u2019t benefitted much from China\u2019s rate cut. It\u2019s only up by 0.2% this morning. China is also in the spotlight today as top communist officials gather to hammer out its 13th five-year plan, setting the country\u2019s economic programme until 2020. Premier Li Keqiang has already indicated that slower growth is on the agenda, by declaring that Beijing will not \u201cdefend to the death\u201d its target of 7% growth (which was narrowly missed in the third quarter of 2015). He declared: \u201cWe have never said that we should defend to the death any goal, but that the economy should operate within a reasonable range.\u201d Trade links and green issues will also be discussed, as China\u2019s top brass try to manage the country\u2019s economic rebalancing. With China easing monetary policy last week, and the ECB expected to follow suit in December, it could soon be Japan\u2019s turn to stimulate its economy again.... No jubilation in Hong Kong either, where the Hang Seng index just closed 0.2% lower. Investors in Asia have given China\u2019s interest rate cut a cautious reception overnight, but there\u2019s no sign of euphoria. In Shanghai, the main index of Chinese shares rose by just 0.5%, or 17 points, to 3430. Although Friday\u2019s stimulus move has been welcomed, traders are also worrying about whether China is still going to suffer a hard landing. Said Zhang Qi, an analyst at Haitong Securities in Shanghai, says shares got a small lift from the rate cut: \u201cBut the market appeared to be in correction after it rose a lot in October, and some investors sold stocks on the short-lived rise from the rate cuts. So overall, the market stayed stable today.\u201d Japan\u2019s Nikkei gained around 0.7%, but the Australian S&amp;P market dipped a little despite hopes that its mining sector would benefit from Chinese stimulus moves. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll find out whether business confidence in Germany has been badly hit by the Volkswagen saga, and the slowdown in emerging markets. The latest IFO survey, due at 9am GMT, is expect to show that German firms are gloomier about their prospects. That\u2019s understandable, given the drop in German exports, factory output and orders in August. We\u2019ll also be mopping up the reaction to China\u2019s interest rate cut, announced late last week. That did give shares a boost on Friday afternoon, but European stock markets are tipped to fall back this morning, as concerns over the situation in China reemerge. China\u2019s rate cut came just a day after the European Central Bank hinted that it could boost its stimulus package soon, so investors have lots to ponder. China cuts interest rates in surprise move - as it happened In the corporate world, traders are digesting results from advertising giant WPP and French carmaker Peugeot. And we\u2019ll also be keeping an eye on Portugal, where the president has dramatically asked centre-right leader Pedro Passos Coelho to form another government, rather than two eurosceptic left-wing parties.

The expectation component, on the other side, increased to 103.8, from 103.3, continuing its recent positive trend and actually reaching the highest level since June last year.</p> <p>Of course, one should not interpret too much in a single confidence indicator but today\u2019s Ifo reading suggests that the German business community is filing the Volkswagen scandal as a one-off and also shrugs off the risk from a possible Chinese and emerging markets slowdown.

Central banks insist that this does not represent a return to the competitive devaluations and protectionism of the 1930s, but it is starting to look awfully like it.</p> <p>Problem number two is that the monetary stimulus is becoming less and less effective over time. There are two main channels through which QE operates. One is through the exchange rate, but the policy doesn\u2019t work if all countries want a cheaper currency at once. Then, as the weakness of global trade testifies, it is simply robbing Peter to pay Paul.</p> <p>The other channel is through long-term interest rates, which are linked to the price of bonds. When central banks buy bonds, they reduce the available supply and drive up the price. Interest rates (the yield) on bonds move in the opposite direction to the price, so a higher price means borrowing is cheaper for businesses, households and governments.</p> <p>But when bond yields are already at historic lows, it is hard to drive them much lower even with large dollops of QE. In Keynes\u2019s immortal words, central banks are pushing on a piece of string....</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s full analysis on the rate cut:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/25/the-global-economy-warrants-a-big-dose-of-caution\">Why China's interest rate cut may be bad news for the world economy</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-562de19ce4b07b857cc22c0a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-26T08:19:17.000Z\">8.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Copper, a classic measure of the health of the global economy, hasn\u2019t benefitted much from China\u2019s rate cut.

      "bodyText": "British manufacturers are suffering from waning demand from home and abroad, according to the latest business survey highlighting the impact of sputtering global growth and a strong pound. The survey of factory bosses by the business group CBI suggests order books have deteriorated at the fastest pace for three years. Facing a gloomier outlook, manufacturers have scaled back hiring in recent months and are looking to cut spending on training and innovation. The survey echoes other recent economic indicators that suggest demand is being depressed by a downturn in China and the wider global economy, as well as the prospect of more UK spending cuts being announced in the government\u2019s review next month. Official figures released on Tuesday are expected to show that the UK economy slowed in the third quarter as manufacturing remained in the doldrums. The CBI said companies had highlighted concerns about political and economic conditions abroad. It repeated its fears that a stronger pound was knocking competitiveness for UK firms. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI director of economics, said: \u201cManufacturers have been struggling with weak export demand for several months, because of the strength of the pound and subdued global growth. But now they\u2019re also facing pressure back home as domestic demand is easing.\u201d The CBI survey, which assesses the sector based on a balance of responses from individual firms, found that 22% of businesses reported an increase in total new order books. Thirty per cent reported a decrease in the three months to October. That gave a balance of -8%, the lowest since October 2012. New export orders fell at the fastest pace in three years and new domestic orders fell over the quarter for the first time since April 2013. Economists said the strong pound will be felt for some time. \u201cGiven the long time lags involved between changes in export prices and overseas demand, the pound will keep orders weak for months to come,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He added: \u201cThe worst is not over for the manufacturing sector; sterling\u2019s further appreciation over the last year will continue to depress export orders until mid-2016, at least.\u201d The CBI\u2019s survey for 463 companies also showed that manufacturing production edged down during the three months to October, marking the first decline in the past two years. Factory output falling Official figures have shown manufacturing production falling this year. The initial estimate of GDP on Tuesdayis expected to show the services sector continued to power overall economic growth in the third quarter. The consensus forecast is for quarterly growth of 0.6% in the July-September period, down from 0.7% in the second quarter, according to a Reuters poll. Howard Archer, an economist at the IHS Global Insight consultancy, described the CBI survey as \u201cthoroughly disappointing\u201d. \u201cPersistent and seemingly deepening manufacturing weakness is very worrying for hopes that UK growth can ultimately become more balanced and less dependent on the services sector and consumer spending,\u201d he said. The CBI survey echoed that pessimism. It signalled manufacturers\u2019 confidence about their business situation and export prospects for the year ahead fell at the fastest pace since October 2012. But the survey respondents also predicted that overall manufacturing conditions will stabilise in the next three months, with a small rise in output. The survey suggested that headcount rose at the most subdued pace for more than two years in the latest three months. Asked about their investment intentions for the year ahead, manufacturers indicated that their plans for spending on buildings and machinery remained broadly unchanged. Their plans for spending on innovation and training, however, had eased. \u201cWhile on balance firms expect orders to stabilise next quarter, it\u2019s disappointing that firms are having to scale back their investment in innovation,\u201d said Newton-Smith. \u201cOver the longer term, strong investment in innovation and skills is vital to boosting our performance in exports, enhancing our manufacturing growth and improving productivity. It\u2019s crucial that government acts decisively to protect spending in these areas as part of the upcoming comprehensive spending review.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Volkswagen loses sales top spot to Toyota after emissions scandal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has been knocked off the top spot for global car sales by Toyota after taking it from its rival earlier this year, and is likely to languish behind the Japanese firm for the foreseeable future as the emissions-rigging scandal takes full effect. Toyota said it sold 7.5m vehicles in the first nine months of the year, beating VW\u2019s 7.43m reported earlier this month. Both companies had a 1.5% fall in sales, but Toyota outsold Volkswagen in each month of the third quarter. US company General Motors (GM) is in third position after selling 7.2m vehicles, down 1.9% on a year earlier. The figures include less than two weeks of sales after Volkswagen admitted its diesel cars were fitted with a software device to manipulate emissions in official US tests. The scandal has rocked confidence in Volkswagen and has reduced its share of the European car market. In the first half of the year, Volkswagen overtook Toyota to achieve a long-held ambition to become the world\u2019s biggest-selling carmaker. But Volkswagen is now preparing to repair 11m vehicles worldwide and has halted sales of diesel models in several markets. David Bailey, the professor of industrial strategy at Aston University, said: \u201cVolkswagen can say goodbye to being the biggest player for the near future. We haven\u2019t yet seen the full impact of the damage to the firm, and the scandal has killed the diesel market in the US.\u201d Even before the scandal erupted, some analysts thought Volkswagen\u2019s dash for global sales had masked underlying problems, making the company cumbersome and overly complex, with more than 300 models, multiple brands and almost 120 factories. Even as it became the biggest seller worldwide in the first half of the year, Volkswagen suffered its first fall in Chinese sales for a decade. The economic slowdown in China, Volkswagen\u2019s biggest market, hit demand for premium cars, leaving it reliant on low-growth European markets. Sales also fell in the US and Brazil. Martin Winterkorn, the force behind Volkswagen\u2019s global sales push, quit as chief executive last month, less than a week after the scandal broke.

Analysts at RBC have raised their recommendation from sector perform to outperform, while Liberum has moved from hold to buy. Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said there are uncertainties over UK bus operators, and he preferred more diversified groups with overseas exposure: The surprise majority for the Conservative Party in May\u2019s General Election has brought stability to the UK train operators. They now have an unchanged regulatory framework, with the franchise bid timetable intact. However, uncertainty persists for the UK regional bus operators. City devolution is a key government policy, and Sheffield has joined Manchester in gaining powers over local bus services. The extent of these powers is still to be defined. The forthcoming Buses Bill should provide clarity, but this is in consultation and a draft still awaited. The ongoing, if moderated, political risk in the UK, along with sluggish trading conditions in the UK regional bus industry, encourages us to focus on the more diversified groups. Non- UK exposure not only gives geographic diversification, but also spreads regulatory risk. Historically, we have preferred UK regional bus exposure for its commercial freedoms, consistent regulation and superior returns.

      "bodyText": "An investment trust that manages most of the wealth of one of Britain\u2019s richest families will become Britain\u2019s biggest bingo operator in a \u00a3241m deal to buy Gala Bingo. Caledonia Investments has agreed to buy 130 bingo clubs from Gala Coral, the bookmaker preparing to merge with Ladbrokes. Crucially, the Caledonia deal does not include Gala Coral\u2019s online bingo business, galabingo.com, but the clubs will keep the Gala name and the two businesses will work together. Gala Bingo has 38% of the UK bingo market with 1.1 million active members and it made a pretax profit of \u00a333m in the year to September, Caledonia said. Gala is the UK\u2019s biggest bingo operator with 15 million visitors a year, employing 4,000 people. Bingo has staged a surprise revival in recent years, helped by the popularity of the game\u2019s online version and a halving of bingo duty in last year\u2019s budget. In the past month queues have formed outside clubs up and down the country as customers were enticed to play for free in special sessions. The new owners are confident they can build on the recent up-turn in the appeal for a form of entertainment that until recently looked like being in terminal decline. Jane Anscombe of Edison Investment Research said the price tag \u201clooks good for Caledonia given the strong cash-flows\u201d. Simon Longbottom, managing director of Gala\u2019s gaming division, told Euroslot International, a gaming publication: \u201cWe were delighted to see queues forming around some of our clubs. Bingo is a great British institution that thrives on community involvement. So to hear the buzz of a full club made customers and staff alike feel overjoyed.\u201d Caledonia, backed by the Cayzer shipping dynasty, said it was buying Gala Bingo for its steady cashflow and long-term popularity. The current management team, led by the chief executive, Simon Wykes, will stay on. Duncan Johnson, Caledonia\u2019s head of unquoted investments, said: \u201cGala Bingo is well known to Caledonia\u2019s unquoted investments team. Its defensive, enduring business model, which delivers strong cash generation and dividend yield, fit ideally with the investment criteria sought by Caledonia.\u201d Johnson was on the board of Gala Bingo until 2002. Caledonia was bought by the Scottish Cayzer dynasty in 1951 as a holding company for its shipping interests and is still 48.5% owned by the family, whose wealth is estimated at \u00a3620m by the Sunday Times Rich List (\u00a3). The trust has increased its dividend for each of the past 48 years. It donated \u00a375,000 to the Conservative party before the 2010 election but stopped funding the party after other shareholders protested. Will Wyatt, Caledonia\u2019s chief executive, is a direct descendent of Charles Cayzer, who amassed the family\u2019s fortune in the 19th century. The family\u2019s head, Tory peer Lord Rotherwick, is the brother in law of Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England. The trust\u2019s net assets of \u00a31.6bn include investments in private businesses such as loudspeaker maker Bowers &amp; Wilkins and stakes in public companies including AG Barr, the owner of Irn-Bru. Gala Coral said the deal would pave the way for its merger with Ladbrokes to form Britain\u2019s biggest bookmaker. The bingo business was not part of the merger plan. There is still a possibility that the competition regulator might block the deal because the combined group would have too dominant a position in the betting shop market. It is possible that the groups might have to sell off a certain number of shops in order to ensure clearance. Carl Leaver, chief executive of Gala Coral commented: \u201cWe are very pleased to have agreed the sale of Gala Retail, following a competitive process. The sale is another transformative step for Gala Coral Group, following the turnaround of the business over the past few years.\u201d",

The family\u2019s head, Tory peer Lord Rotherwick, is the brother in law of Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England.</p> <p>The trust\u2019s net assets of \u00a31.6bn include investments in private businesses such as loudspeaker maker Bowers &amp; Wilkins and stakes in public companies including AG Barr, the owner of Irn-Bru. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/24/ladbrokes-and-gala-coral-to-merge\">Gala Coral said the deal would pave the way for its merger with Ladbrokes to form Britain\u2019s biggest bookmaker. </a>The bingo business was not part of the merger plan. </p> <p>There is still a possibility that the competition regulator might block the deal because the combined group would have too dominant a position in the betting shop market. It is possible that the groups might have to sell off a certain number of shops in order to ensure clearance.</p> <p>Carl Leaver, chief executive of Gala Coral commented: \u201cWe are very pleased to have agreed the sale of Gala Retail, following a competitive process. The sale is another transformative step for Gala Coral Group, following the turnaround of the business over the past few years.\u201d</p>",

Britain\u2019s biggest specialist wine retailer said that from Tuesday customers would be able to buy single bottles in store and online. It also promised clearer prices after customers said the offers were too complicated. Majestic said it had experimented with allowing single-bottle purchases at some stores over the past few months and the change had proved popular with new and existing customers.

Abandoning the minimum purchase is a big move for Majestic, which sold wines by the case when it was launched in 1980 from a warehouse in Wood Green, north London. When the minimum purchase was halved to six bottles in 2009 it was popular but Gormley said the rule was out of date amid fierce competition. He said: \u201cOur customers were telling us that they wanted simpler, clearer pricing, and an end to the six-bottle minimum. There are now no barriers to shopping at Majestic, the pricing structure is very straightforward and I\u2019m sure our customers will see this as a great move.\u201d Gormley took over running Majestic in April when the company bought his Naked Wines online business after poor Christmas trading capped a run of disappointing results. Majestic has been under pressure from supermarkets using wine promotions to attract customers from each other and fight off the German discounters Aldi and Lidl.

      "bodyText": "A Western Australian man is in jail awaiting extradition to the United States for his alleged role in the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal. The extradition order relates to allegations, which first emerged in 2012, that traders had manipulated the Libor rate, a benchmark interest rate that some of the world\u2019s leading banks charge each other for short-term loans, for their own benefit. Paul Thompson was arrested on an extradition order by Australian federal police in Perth on Thursday and was taken to Hakea Remand Centre. The 49-year-old, who lives with his family in the inner-city Perth suburb of Dalkeith, is wanted for prosecution in the US for charges of wire and bank fraud. Thompson was charged alongside two other Rabobank employees in January 2014 with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud and two counts of wire fraud. According to a statement made by acting assistant US attorney general, Mythili Raman, at the time those charges were laid, the three men, \u201cdeliberately submitted what they called \u2018obscenely high\u2019 or \u2018silly low\u2019 Libor rates in order to benefit their own trading positions\u201d. A spokesman from the Australian attorney general\u2019s office confirmed Thompson\u2019s arrest on Monday but said it was inappropriate to comment further as the matter was now before court. Australian-born Thompson is the former head of Dutch-owned Rabobank Groep\u2019s money market and derivatives trading in south-east Asia and worked for the bank, based in Singapore, between 2006 and 2011. He is one of seven Rabobank employees to be charged in connection to the Libor scandal, which spans across 18 financial institutions and 35 individuals. The charges all relate to allegations traders colluded to fix Libor interest rates. Under the system operating at the time, the Libor was supposed to be set based on an average of supposedly independent submissions made by a number of banks. The trial of London-based former Rabobank employees Anthony Allen, the former global head of liquidity and finance, and Anthony Conti, a senior trader, began in New York this month. Both have denied the allegations. According to the Wall Street Journal, three other Rabobank employees have pleaded guilty and one man is yet to enter a plea. In 2013 the bank agreed to a US$1.07bn settlement to the US, British, Dutch and Japanese authorities. Thompson\u2019s wife Robyn told The Wall Street Journal that she didn\u2019t believe her husband should be tried in the US. \u201cThere is no reason for Paul to be charged by the US,\u201d she said. \u201cFor this reason we were hoping that Paul could defend himself against any allegations in either Australia or the UK, so he could have access to the necessary evidence, financial and emotional support to do this properly.\u201d But the family has not yet indicated it intends to fight the extradition order. In another statement made to the West Australian on Sunday, a person identified only as a spokesman for the family said they would be seeking to have Thompson bailed \u201cas there is no need for him to be in prison while they are addressing the extradition process\u201d. \u201cAs a devoted and loving father Paul poses no risk to anyone in the community and he has not left Perth in the last couple of years, even though he has been aware of these charges since early 2014,\u201d the spokesman said. The spokesman said that Thompson had never worked in the US nor for a US-owned company and had no direct connections to America, and repeated their desire to have the case heard in either Australia or the UK. Guardian Australia has sought comment from Thompson\u2019s family. Under Australia\u2019s procedure for extradition requests, a person who is arrested subject to an extradition order can only be bailed in \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Ridley Scott\u2019s next film and the latest Chris Hemsworth vehicle, Thor: Ragnarok, will be filmed in Australia. The joyful announcement by the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, and the arts minister, Mitch Fifield, celebrated their fine work in persuading 20th Century Fox and Marvel Studies to bring their productions here. The fine work was really done by the money: $47.25m in direct funding to the two productions. And the dollar, at US$0.70 once again, means spending US dollars in Australia makes good sense. What the announcement didn\u2019t say was the $47.25m is only half of the money that the government will provide. It doesn\u2019t include the 16.5% tax offset the productions will receive via the \u201clocation offset\u201d. The location offset is designed to entice big-budget ($15m+) film productions to Australia. I have a bit of a soft spot for it, because in my former life as a public servant it was my job to administer it. But it doesn\u2019t get mentioned by politicians because it is covered by the tax secrecy laws. In total, though, it\u2019s a lot of money. The ministry for the arts notes that in 2014\u201315, there were 56 applications for the location offset and PDV offset (which is a 30% rebate for post and visual effects work), which led to production expenditure in Australia of $356.73m. Rebates payable in 2014-15 for those offsets totalled $69.4m. The policy is the big-budget Hollywood films provide a level of work that keeps the industry going, allowing companies to invest in equipment and training which then can be used on Australian productions, leading to a better quality Australian product. Anecdotally, I am aware companies do often provide services for lower rates to local film productions than they do when Hollywood comes to town. Australian films also get a secret tax rebate, the \u201cproducer offset\u201d, which provides a 40% rebate on production costs if production qualifies as \u201csignificantly Australian\u201d. In 2013-14, the three offsets combined cost $252.0m, according to the Productivity Commission, making it the ninth-biggest budgetary assistance program given to any industry: Most nations have similar tax rebates or credits that are higher than the 16.5% we offer. Ausfilm, the government-funded organisation that markets Australia to international film producers, has lobbied for the location offset to be raised to 30% in order for it to be more competitive. Put bluntly: it\u2019s a hell of a lot easier for an LA film production to go to Vancouver and pretend it\u2019s in San Francisco than it is to fly to the Gold Coast and do so. But instead of raising the location offset to 30%, the government provides money on an ad hoc basis to provide money to make up the difference. The $47.25m in funding announced by Bishop last week for two films is around 15% of the $300m the production will spend in Australia making the film. Add that to the 16.5% rebate and total government subsidy of the film is around the 30% mark. This means the full government investment into the two productions is of the order of $90m, not $47.25m. The Turnbull government is not the first to do this. In 2012 Julia Gillard announced $12.8m for the production of X-Men: Wolverine, and in 2013, the production of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea received $21.6m (filming is yet to begin). So is it good policy? Economically speaking, not really. So costly have the tax credits been in the US, that some states \u2013 such as Louisiana \u2013 have begun to wind them back. Sure, it will bring in $300m in offshore investment to Australia\u2019s economy and create 3,000 (temporary) jobs, but there are plenty of other companies that would add jobs and growth were they given a 16.5% tax break. Certainly since the offsets were introduced in 2007, production has increased. International production took a massive hit from the high dollar and the GFC, but overall production in the Australian film industry is doing well. However, studies in the US suggest the state film tax credits have delivered negligible economic benefits and many of the jobs go to out-of-state workers who come for the production and then leave (although that is less of an issue here). Of course, film funding is not just economic policy, but cultural. So are they delivering on the cultural objectives? And how do we measure that? The producer offset was designed to encourage bigger Australian productions, and it certainly has: Australia, The Great Gatsby, The Lego Movie, Mad Max: Fury Road, the upcoming Gods of Egypt, and I, Frankenstein. Local audiences like these global blockbusters too. Earlier this month Screen Australia noted that Australian films by the start of October had already broken the annual box office record: Mad Max: Fury Road was largely responsible which is no real issue \u2013 box office records are always driven by big-tent pole features. In real terms 2015 is thus Australia\u2019s ninth strongest year for the cinema, the best result since 2000 (The Dish, The Wog Boy, Looking for Alibrandi and Chopper). Or 14th best since 1980 when you consider our national share of the box office take. That share, 6.8%, will definitely fall once the latest Hunger Games and Star Wars movies are released. The problem is the box office is almost a rigged game \u2013 we just don\u2019t have the money to compete. In 1992 when Australian films took in 9% of the Australian box office, the average budget of the top 10 films was US$39.5m, and the average box office takings in Australia was A$11.05m. Last year the average budget of the top 10 films in Australia was US$127m \u2013 a 221% increase. The average box office take? A$26.4m \u2013 only a 139% increase: The cost of making popular films has soared well beyond that which can be recouped just in Australia. The costs have risen but the audiences haven\u2019t: Consider that in 1982 The Man From Snowy River took in $17.23m. The then-average price of $5 a ticket meant around 3.44m tickets were sold. If that many tickets were sold for a film in 2014, it would make $47.11m. For context, last year the most popular movie in Australia was The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1, a massive smash, with a built-in audience, and it made only $32.8m. This cost is also connected with how films make money now. Back in 1982 a film had time to find an audience \u2013 important for the small films Australia generally produces. In 1982, the top 50 films in the US made just 12.8% of their money from the opening weekend; now it\u2019s around 31%: When nearly a third of your income comes from the first weekend you need to make a splash \u2013 an expensive splash. Is there room for a small, plucky Aussie film? Well yes \u2013 Paper Planes, which also received $1.466m in direct funding from Screen Australia, made $9.65m. Oddball, which received $2.263m, made $8.12m. And Last Cab to Darwin, which received $978,500, took in $7.15m. These are fantastic efforts, but they\u2019ll never see Australian-produced efforts crack more than 5-6% of our box office. To get over 10%, the top five Australian films would need to make around $90m combined. How hard is that? It\u2019s roughly the combined takings of Mad Max: Fury Road, The Water Diviner, The Great Gatsby, The Sapphires and Red Dog \u2013 essentially five good years in one. So how to judge the performance of our film polices? Well certainly we have bigger productions, and we are making films that can find a good-sized audience. And artistically, as critics like Luke Buckmaster noted last week, the last 10 years were something of a golden age. So the various film tax offsets are doing what they were expected to do \u2013 increasing domestic film production, of both overseas and domestic films. And there is evidence the policy has led to an increase in audiences for Australian films. Does the cost justify the ends? Given we\u2019re talking both economic and cultural policy, it\u2019s a hard question to answer. It is made doubly difficult for voters, because while the location offset ensures the money and jobs the industry needs to keep it sustained, tax secrecy means you\u2019ll never hear politicians talk about it.",

International production took a massive hit from the high dollar and the GFC, but overall production in the Australian film industry is doing well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"greg\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tEiVI/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>However, studies in <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/research/state-film-subsidies-not-much-bang-for-too-many-bucks?fa=view&amp;id=3326\">the US</a> suggest the state film tax credits have delivered negligible economic benefits and many of the jobs go to out-of-state workers who come for the production and then leave (although that is less of an issue here). </p> <p>Of course, film funding is not just economic policy, but cultural. So are they delivering on the cultural objectives? And how do we measure that?</p> <p>The producer offset was designed to encourage bigger Australian productions, and it certainly has: Australia, The Great Gatsby, The Lego Movie, Mad Max: Fury Road, the upcoming <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2404233/reference\">Gods of Egypt</a>, and I, Frankenstein.</p> <p>Local audiences like these global blockbusters too. Earlier this month <a href=\"http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2015/mr_151007_recordbreakingyear.aspx\">Screen Australia noted</a> that Australian films by the start of October had already broken the annual box office record:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grog\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dO324/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Mad Max: Fury Road was largely responsible which is no real issue \u2013 box office records are always driven by big-tent pole features. </p> <p>In real terms 2015 is thus Australia\u2019s ninth strongest year for the cinema, the best result since 2000 (The Dish, The Wog Boy, Looking for Alibrandi and Chopper). Or 14th best since 1980 when you consider our national share of the box office take. That share, 6.8%, will definitely fall once the latest Hunger Games and Star Wars movies are released.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/may/02/10-classic-australian-films-that-required-government-funding\">10 classic Australian films that were government funded</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problem is the box office is almost a rigged game \u2013 we just don\u2019t have the money to compete. In 1992 when Australian films took in 9% of the Australian box office, the average budget of the top 10 films was US$39.5m, and the average box office takings in Australia was A$11.05m. </p> <p>Last year the average budget of the top 10 films in Australia was US$127m \u2013 a 221% increase. The average box office take? A$26.4m \u2013 only a 139% increase:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"greg\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MuSkp/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The cost of making popular films has soared well beyond that which can be recouped just in Australia. The costs have risen but the audiences haven\u2019t:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"greg\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2Gi1v/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Consider that in 1982 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/may/02/the-man-from-snowy-river-rewatching-classic-australian-films\">The Man From Snowy River</a> took in $17.23m. The then-average price of $5 a ticket meant around 3.44m tickets were sold. If that many tickets were sold for a film in 2014, it would make $47.11m. </p> <p>For context, last year the most popular movie in Australia was The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1, a massive smash, with a built-in audience, and it made only $32.8m. </p> <p>This cost is also connected with how films make money now. Back in 1982 a film had time to find an audience \u2013 important for the small films Australia generally produces. In 1982, the top 50 films in the US made just 12.8% of their money from the opening weekend; now it\u2019s around 31%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"greg\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/q2pGb/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> When nearly a third of your income comes from the first weekend you need to make a splash \u2013 an expensive splash. </p> <p>Is there room for a small, plucky Aussie film? Well yes \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/14/paper-planes-review-a-heart-on-sleeve-tournament-movie-just-for-the-kids\">Paper Planes</a>, which also received $1.466m in direct funding from Screen Australia, made $9.65m. Oddball, which received $2.263m, made $8.12m. And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/07/last-cab-to-darwin-first-look-review-\">Last Cab to Darwin</a>, which received $978,500, took in $7.15m.</p> <p>These are fantastic efforts, but they\u2019ll never see Australian-produced efforts crack more than 5-6% of our box office. To get over 10%, the top five Australian films would need to make around $90m combined.</p> <p>How hard is that? It\u2019s roughly the combined takings of Mad Max: Fury Road, The Water Diviner, The Great Gatsby, The Sapphires and Red Dog \u2013 essentially five good years in one. </p> <p>So how to judge the performance of our film polices? Well certainly we have bigger productions, and we are making films that can find a good-sized audience. And artistically, as critics like Luke Buckmaster <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/20/australias-lost-wave-of-film-or-the-renaissance-nobodys-noticed\">noted last week</a>, the last 10 years were something of <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-23/hugo-weaving-on-staying-grounded-and-australian-films/6876936\">a golden age</a>. </p> <p>So the various film tax offsets are doing what they were expected to do \u2013 increasing domestic film production, of both overseas and domestic films. And there is evidence the policy has led to an increase in audiences for Australian films. </p> <p>Does the cost justify the ends? Given we\u2019re talking both economic and cultural policy, it\u2019s a hard question to answer. It is made doubly difficult for voters, because while the location offset ensures the money and jobs the industry needs to keep it sustained, tax secrecy means you\u2019ll never hear politicians talk about it.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the country\u2019s leading retailers has criticised the government\u2019s planned changes to Sunday trading laws, saying they are open to abuse. Under plans first revealed in the July budget, the government wants to hand new powers to local councils and mayors in England and Wales to relax rules that currently restrict the number of hours large stores can open on Sundays. The changes would also allow local authorities to create special zones in which longer opening hours would apply. Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, said the proposals were too complex and not something customers wanted. Retailers were divided over whether there should be relaxation of Sunday trading hours, he said, but all agreed the current plans wwere \u201cnot a sensible way of going about it\u201d. The proposed laws \u201care open to interpretation and open to abuse. There\u2019s a lot of complexity in the way it\u2019s being framed,\u201d he said. The current rules worked well and were \u201ca happy British compromise\u201d, he added. \u201cThere\u2019s no customer demand for it, or colleague demand for it as far as we are concerned. The current rules work,\u201d he said. If change were deemed necessary, ideally the same rules would apply everywhere, he said, adding that passing control to local authorities could create a series of problems. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to be localised there needs to be some guidelines, some rules enshrined in law [about] whatever a zone actually comprises. I want to see a legally enforceable definition of a zone.\u201d He suggested that the proposals would make it possible to \u201cdraw a line around an Asda store and that could open and nothing else can\u201d. Under the 1994 Sunday Trading Act, stores over 3,000 sq ft are only allowed to open for six hours on Sundays. When it launched a consultation on the planned changes in August, the government said the current system was \u201cdamaging to bricks and mortar stores and frustrating for customers\u201d. It said the restrictions were holding back productivity for retailers and increasing prices. A number of MPs, including some Conservatives are opposed to the changes, but David Cameron has personally backed the idea. Last week, he told parliament there was a strong case for change in response to a question from Labour\u2019s Susan Elan Jones. MPs were set to vote on the changes this week, but that has been delayed while ministers seek more support for the measures, which will be included in the cities and local government devolution bill. The consultation into the planned changes closed last month, and the business department is analysing the feedback. Retailers are divided. Andy Clarke, the boss of Asda, has hailed the proposals as common sense, and Marc Bolland, the M&amp;S chief, said they would be welcome in some areas. James Lowman, the chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, said the group was completely opposed changes that he said would seriously disadvantage independent shopkeepers. \u201cWe think the current laws are a good compromise that work by balancing the needs of the small and large shopkeeper. They give us an advantage on Sunday evenings, cater to the needs of shop workers and are popular with consumers,\u201d he said. Polling conducted by ComRes earlier this year showed that more than three-quarters of the public support the current rules. \u201cThere is no evidence that relaxation would increase overall sales. Sales would spread from small to large stores and over more hours,\u201d Lowman said. He said local authorities would also face a number of issues. If a neighbouring authority chose to allow stores to open on a Sunday, they might be forced to follow suit. Lowman also suggested they were more likely to liberalise trading hours for out-of-town centres and shopping malls, meaning that already struggling high streets might come under more pressure.",
