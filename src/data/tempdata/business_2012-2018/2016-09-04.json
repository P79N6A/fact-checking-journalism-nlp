      "bodyText": "A raft of data published this week will offer the latest health check on the state of the UK economy following June\u2019s vote to leave the EU, with economists expecting the figures to suggest businesses were so far \u201cproving resilient\u201d. On Monday, figures will show how confidence is holding up in the UK service sector, from the latest survey of purchasing managers. Andrew Sentance, senior economics adviser at PwC, said the update would be the most closely scrutinised of all the data due this week after activity and orders in July were found to have contracted at the fastest rate since early 2009. \u201cPeople will be looking very closely to see if there is a bounce back in confidence, as we saw in last week\u2019s PMI survey for manufacturing, and it would not be surprising if there is,\u201d he said. Sentance said it was possible that the business mood in July \u201cwas affected by the shock of the vote and the political fallout\u201d. He added: \u201cSpeaking to businesses it seems confidence has improved as they have realised that the UK economy is not falling off a cliff.\u201d Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said he expected the industry survey to show \u201cmodest expansion\u201d in August. \u201cBoth the manufacturing (especially) and construction (to a limited extent) surveys have shown activity picking up in August after marked weakness in July, and we suspect that this will be the case for the services sector as well,\u201d he said. Although he added that there were likely to be falls in activity in sectors involving commercial property and house sales, which have both taken a hit since the vote to leave. Archer was generally upbeat about this week\u2019s slew of data, some of which is covering the post-referendum period for the first time. \u201cThere is likely to be further evidence that the economy is proving resilient so far following June\u2019s Brexit vote,\u201d he said. Sentance said unless there was anything shocking in this week\u2019s figures \u201cit would reinforce the view that the economy might not grow that quickly in the short term but will hold up reasonably well in the final quarter\u201d. Consumer spending appears not to have taken a knock, with shoppers who are spending getting more for their money. Morrisons launched a new grocery price war at the weekend, and food prices have been tumbling. The latest index from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and industry analysts Nielsen showed a 1.1% fall in prices in August, following a 0.8% drop in July. Meanwhile the cost of non-food items fell by 2.5% over the month, compared with a 2.2% drop in July. The report said a combination of promotional activity by retailers, softening oil prices and a global glut of wheat had all pushed down prices. When the BRC releases a separate report on retail sales on Tuesday, Archer said he expected the numbers to be healthy, with low prices and rising pay supporting consumer spending. The CBI has already published data covering the first half of the month, which showed a summer bounce in sales, while the Office for National Statistics reported a 1.4% increase in July. \u201cRetail sales appear to have been helped in August, as they were in July, by good weather lifting demand for clothing,\u201d said Archer, adding that they may also have been boosted by the feelgood factor of Team GB\u2019s Olympics success, and by visiting tourists exploiting the weakness of the pound to splash out on luxury goods. However, Archer warned that consumer purchasing power could wane as companies look to limit pay increases and inflation rises. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said that prices could start to rise given the devaluation of sterling following the referendum result. \u201cBut that\u2019s likely to take several months to properly feed through, given that retailers won\u2019t feel the brunt of the cost increases until existing contracts with foreign suppliers come to an end,\u201d she said. \u201cEven then, retailers will have to make a decision about when and how much to pass onto consumers. Given the strength of competition in the market, and if the economy softens in line with predictions, any pass through may be more limited than implied by the exchange rate movement.\u201d Official figures on manufacturing and construction due out this week are for July, and only cover the very early days after the referendum. Archer said he expected the ONS data on manufacturing output to show a 0.7% fall month-on-month, with some work having been postponed or cancelled as a result of uncertainty in the immediate aftermath of the vote. Sentance said he would be looking at the figures for capital goods as an early indicator of whether businesses were still investing. However, he said it was very early to reach conclusions on the impact of Brexit. This was echoed by the manufacturing employers group EEF, which said its members were seeing \u201ca mixed picture\u201d so far. Its latest manufacturing outlook survey, produced with accountants BDO, showed that in the third quarter of the year activity levels remained largely unchanged but that confidence in the overall UK economy had taken a knock. Mechanical equipment suffered a big decline but export orders had exceeded expectations, particularly for electronics and electrical equipment. And while recruitment of new employees had fallen, EEF\u2019s members said they did expect to take more people on in the future. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, said: \u201cSigns of an export revival are helping to drive more optimism about activity in the second half of the year, but concerns about whether the UK economy can shrug off post-referendum challenges is clearly evident.\u201d She added: \u201cThese risks are expected to hit some sectors \u2013 such as industries linked to investment goods and construction \u2013 harder than others. Despite the short-term outlook for manufacturing remaining broadly stable, the continued downward slide in investment plans should keep policy makers alive to the potential risks facing the sector.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s largest firms paid directors bigger bonuses in 2015 than the previous year, despite a fall in the number of shareholders backing their remuneration plans, according to analysis by Deloitte. The City firm, which advises many top companies on how to pay executives, said new regulations that increased disclosure and brought in binding votes on board pay had to some extent put the brakes on executive payouts amongst FTSE 100 firms. The median salary increased by 2% in 2015, in line with the previous three years, and the median amount that could be earned as a bonus remained at 150% of salary, where it has been since 2007. But its analysis of the UK\u2019s largest companies found that bonus payments in respect of performance increased last year, with the median payout rising to 77% of the maximum possible, from 73% in 2014. Only four companies paid no bonus to executive directors, it said, while seven companies paid the maximum amount possible. This year has seen more companies face a pay revolt than the so-called shareholder spring in 2012, Deloitte said, suggesting that it could be a \u201cpivotal moment for executive pay\u201d. Eight companies have received less than 75% backing from investors for their remuneration reports and two failed to secure a majority. Just 26% of the top 30 companies were approved by 95% of shareholders or more, just half of the proportion of last year. In April, 60% of shareholders voted against a \u00a314m pay package for the chief executive of BP, in a year in which it reported record losses and cut thousands of jobs, and more than 50% of investors voted against pay deals at the medical equipment group Smith &amp; Nephew. Other big firms also faced pay rebellions. Stephen Cahill, partner in Deloitte\u2019s remuneration team, said: \u201cWhile we\u2019re still talking about a relatively small number of companies, this is rightly a cause for concern. The 2016 AGM season has been bruising for a number of companies, perhaps even more so than the shareholder spring of 2012.\u201d Deloitte said concerns raised by shareholders included bonus targets not being disclosed and a lack of transparency about the link between executive pay and the performance of the business. Cahill said median bonus payouts had consistently been between 70% and 80% of the maximum every year for the last 10 years. \u201cWe believe there needs to be much more rigour in the way the targets for these plans are determined, more discretion used to ensure payouts reflect overall performance, and greater scrutiny by investors once the targets are disclosed.\u201d Votes on remuneration that has already been paid are not binding for firms, but it has been suggested that the rules be changed. Cahill said this would cause some practical issues and may make shareholders more reluctant to vote against a deal. Instead he suggested a \u201cyellow card\u201d approach: \u201cFor example, if a company received less than 75% of votes in support a binding vote would be required in the following year, giving the company time to address the problem.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct braces for investor revolt against management at AGM", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct is braced for a fierce investor revolt at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting this week as another influential City investor declared it would vote against the reappointment of chairman Keith Hellawell. Hermes Investment Management, which manages and advises on \u00a3215bn of assets, is the latest to call for Hellawell to go, saying it will vote against his reappointment on Wednesday. A year ago, the UK fund manager had abstained in a similar vote on Hellawell\u2019s role. A number of other major UK investors \u2013 including Legal &amp; General, Aberdeen Asset Management and Royal London \u2013 are also believed to have lost patience with Hellawell, who is being targeted this year by shareholders unhappy at the group\u2019s governance failures. On Friday, three of North America\u2019s largest investors \u2013 CalPERs, CALSTRS and the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan \u2013 came out in opposition to Hellawell. These voices will be hard to ignore this year after the City regulator introduced changes to voting rules which, in some circumstances, can give greater sway to the views of minority investors. Last year, despite considerable investor unease, Hellawell\u2019s position as chairman was effectively unassailable because he enjoyed the support of the firm\u2019s executive deputy chairman, Mike Ashley, who controls 55% of shares. Since then, new rules from the Financial Conduct Authority have come into force for companies where there is a single dominant investor on the share register. In such cases, non-executive directors must separately win the backing of minority investors. Last year, 28% of shareholders voted against the re-election of Hellawell or abstained, though several are believed to have expressed concerns about him behind closed doors. Hermes has also lost patience with three other Sports Direct directors, and is expected to oppose the re-election of chief executive Dave Forsey, finance director Matt Pearson and non-executive Simon Bentley. Meanwhile Royal London, Britain\u2019s biggest mutual investment manager, is expected to vote against Hellawell for the second year running. It will also oppose the other three non-executives: Bentley, Dave Singleton and Clair Jenkins. Last year Royal London, which manages \u00a394bn of funds, voted for Jenkins. Both Hermes and Royal London will also vote for a separate resolution proposed by trade unions calling for an independent review of labour practices at Sports Direct, in the wake of a highly critical parliamentary report sparked by a Guardian investigation. The union resolution is opposed by the Sport Direct board, but has won widespread support from leading investor groups. Leon Kamhi, Hermes\u2019 head of responsibility, said: \u201cThe chairman, Keith Hellawell, together with independent directors Simon Bentley and David Singleton, have lost the confidence of many of Sports Direct\u2019s minority shareholders and should step down from the board. An external, independent successor to the chair role should be appointed as soon as possible, followed by additional independent directors.\u201d Further disclosures about Sports Direct have included Ashley appointing his daughter\u2019s boyfriend to manage the property arm and paying an obscure company owned by Ashley\u2019s brother to handle international deliveries. The stream of bad news in the past year has coincided with declining financial performance and the share price more than halving, pushing the company out of the FTSE 100 index. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at Royal London, accused the company of being reckless with shareholders\u2019 money and said other investors increasingly shared Royal London\u2019s concerns. She said: \u201cAt the risk of sounding like a broken record, we are astonished at the lack of improvement in corporate governance matters at Sports Direct, despite repeated attempts by ourselves and other investors to push for positive changes at the firm. \u201cSince the 2015 AGM, despite slight increases in revenues and gross profits, the company\u2019s share price has fallen 60% following scandal after scandal, a clear sign of the impact which severe corporate governance issues can have on investors\u2019 long-term outlook for a company.\u201d Hellawell, chairman since 2009, will be the main target for angry shareholders at the AGM at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook head office. Last year almost 24% of independent shareholders voted for Hellawell\u2019s removal but long-standing critics believe a majority could oppose him on Wednesday after investors who had turned a blind eye became concerned. Kamhi said Hermes abstained on Hellawell\u2019s appointment last year because it had not had the chance to speak to the former senior police officer. Now Hermes has told Hellawell he should resign. \u201cWe have given him the benefit of the doubt for some time but there remain considerable issues at Sports Direct and we think it is time to step down,\u201d Kamhi said. The meeting could be a discordant event with other fund managers expected to join Hermes by sending representatives to speak. The Investor Forum, which represents big shareholders, is expected to attend and MPs are sending a committee official to observe the meeting. Standard Life, Sports Direct\u2019s second-biggest shareholder after Ashley with 5%, declined to comment on how it would vote but it has opposed Hellawell at the past two meetings. A report into labour practices, commissioned by Sports Direct from the law firm RPC, could be released early this week but many investors doubt its independence because of close links between RPC and Ashley. Shareholders are divided about whether Ashley, whose title is executive deputy chairman, should stay on the board. Royal London has opposed the billionaire\u2019s re-election but Kamhi said the company would benefit from Ashley\u2019s retail nous, as long as it is managed properly.",

      "bodyText": "An ailing Mao Zedong was presiding over the last knockings of the Cultural Revolution when the era of modern summitry was launched in a French chateau just outside Paris in late 1975. It\u2019s a reasonable bet that none of those present at Rambouillet envisaged that 43 years later the annual get-together for their successors would be in Hangzhou. The emergence of China as an economic superpower with its distinctive breed of state capitalism is a striking example of what has changed in the past four decades. Back then, the six developed nations represented at Rambouillet dominated the global economy. These days it would be inconceivable to hold a meeting to discuss trade, currencies or climate change without the Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians, the Russians and the Saudis. The G6 has become the G20. But while the guest list has expanded, the agenda has remained similar. The inspiration for Giscard d\u2019Estaing\u2019s fireside chat in 1975 was the stagflation unleashed by the weakening of the post second world war boom, triggered by soaring oil prices. The summit was an attempt to reinvigorate the full employment model that had delivered record levels of growth over the previous quarter of a century, but it proved impossible to return to business as usual. Time was up for a generation represented by Harold Wilson and Gerald Ford, both attendees at Rambouillet. The G20 was born in equally difficult circumstances. It met for the first time in Washington a couple of months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, just after the US had voted for Barack Obama to succeed George W Bush. As in the 1970s, the prevailing economic model had suffered system failure. This time the problem was caused by unfettered capital flows and over-exposed banks. Again the imperative was to return to business as usual as quickly as possible. Again, the attempt has been unsuccessful. The extent of the failure was highlighted by the International Monetary Fund in the report it prepared for the Hangzhou G20. \u201cThe weak outlook can further reduce incentives to invest and slow down trade, adding to demand shortfalls and limiting the room for productivity gains going forward. At the same time, income growth has not only been meagre, it has bypassed low-income earners in many countries, raising anxiety about globalisation and worsening the climate for political reform.\u201d You don\u2019t need the skills of a Bletchley Park cryptographer to get the gist. The fund\u2019s message is that there is a lack of investment, a lack of good, well-paid jobs, and a growing disenchantment with the status quo. Hence Donald Trump and his plan to build a wall along the Rio Grande. Hence Brexit, the rise of the Five Star Movement in Italy, and the support for Marine Le Pen in France. To be sure, these trends can be over-stated. Governments of the centre-right and centre-left are still in power in Germany, Italy and France. The polls suggest Trump is going to lose to Hillary Clinton, and Le Pen is unlikely to be the next president of France. Greece\u2019s experiment with the radical left has not been an unalloyed success. But the fund is still right to be concerned. Globalisation was sold to voters in the west as a system that would deliver greater prosperity for all through more open markets. Yet as the IMF noted, the income for top earners in many developed countries has been rising while remaining stagnant for those at the bottom. The customers are not getting what it says on the tin. In his new book*, Guy Standing says it is a myth that the political and economic changes of the 1970s created free markets. Instead, he argues, globalisation has hastened the development of rigged markets dominated by \u201ca plutocracy and plutocratic corporations linked to concentrated financial capital that are able to gain increasing amounts of rental income by virtue of their wealth. Meanwhile wages are stagnating\u201d. Interestingly, this critique has echoes of another feature of the 1970s \u2013 the Alternative Economic Strategy (AES) developed by Tony Benn and his allies on the left of the Labour party. The main thrust of the strategy was that Britain\u2019s economic problems stemmed from the size and power of multinational corporations able to exploit their market power by pushing up prices while at the same time under-investing. Rejecting the idea that Keynesian demand management was sufficient to tackle what Benn called the \u201cspiral of decline\u201d in manufacturing, the AES provided a radical alternative. It involved public ownership of a company in each key sector of the economy, planning agreements with big private-sector companies, price controls, industrial democracy, curbs on imports and withdrawal from what was then the European Economic Community. While Benn and his allies were putting together the strategy, Mrs Thatcher was putting together what might be called the \u201calternative alternative economy strategy\u201d. There was agreement between Benn and Thatcher that British capitalism was in a bad way and a shared derision for the attempts to fix it by the Wilson and Callaghan governments. But there was disagreement about the remedy: Thatcher wanted to sweep away the physical and financial controls without which Benn\u2019s siege economy would not have been viable, and her idea of industrial democracy was to limit the power of the trade unions and restore the \u201cright to manage\u201d. Thatcher\u2019s opponents inside the Conservative party were as dismissive of her ideas as Benn\u2019s enemies inside the Labour party were of his. But only one of the alternative economic strategies was ever implemented, and it was not the left\u2019s. Decades later, there are again competing alternative economic strategies. On the right, Theresa May\u2019s plan to make Brexit work involves some themes familiar to those in the 1970s: workers on boards, an industrial strategy, the need for more public investment. On the left, the Labour party is led by Jeremy Corbyn, who is as critical of Labour\u2019s handling of the economy under Blair and Brown as the Bennites were of the policies pursued by Wilson and Callaghan. If Corbyn\u2019s approach has echoes of the AES that\u2019s because the problems identified in the 1970s \u2013 hollowing out of manufacturing, under-investment and the power of multinational corporations \u2013 remain unresolved. Of course, pursuing an AES in the 2010s is a lot more difficult than it was in the 1970s. Globalisation has seen to that. It is also possible that the AES will be rejected by voters just as it was in 1983. But it is important to understand why Corbyn sees a role for nationalising the train operating companies, why he would set up a national investment bank, and why he retains a strong degree of Euroscepticism. His critique, that there is something dysfunctional about modern industrial capitalism, has not changed since he was a supporter of Benn in the 1970s and 1980s. And, after a decade of crisis, recession and austerity, that\u2019s perhaps unsurprising. * The Corruption of Capitalism by Guy Standing (Biteback, \u00a317.99).

But there was disagreement about the remedy: Thatcher wanted to sweep away the physical and financial controls without which Benn\u2019s siege economy would not have been viable, and her idea of industrial democracy was to limit the power of the trade unions and restore the \u201cright to manage\u201d. Thatcher\u2019s opponents inside the Conservative party were as dismissive of her ideas as Benn\u2019s enemies inside the Labour party were of his. But only one of the alternative economic strategies was ever implemented, and it was not the left\u2019s.</p> <p>Decades later, there are again competing alternative economic strategies. On the right, Theresa May\u2019s plan to make Brexit work involves some themes familiar to those in the 1970s: workers on boards, an industrial strategy, the need for more public investment.</p> <p>On the left, the Labour party is led by Jeremy Corbyn, who is as critical of Labour\u2019s handling of the economy under Blair and Brown as the Bennites were of the policies pursued by Wilson and Callaghan.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/28/the-guardian-view-on-labours-economic-policy-careful-words-bold-intent\"> If Corbyn\u2019s approach has echoes of the AES</a> that\u2019s because the problems identified in the 1970s \u2013 hollowing out of manufacturing, under-investment and the power of multinational corporations \u2013 remain unresolved.</p> <p>Of course, pursuing an AES in the 2010s is a lot more difficult than it was in the 1970s. Globalisation has seen to that. It is also possible that the AES will be rejected by voters just as it was in 1983. But it is important to understand why Corbyn sees a role for nationalising the train operating companies, why he would set up a national investment bank, and why he retains a strong degree of Euroscepticism. His critique, that there is something dysfunctional about modern industrial capitalism, has not changed since he was a supporter of Benn in the 1970s and 1980s. And, after a decade of crisis, recession and austerity, that\u2019s perhaps unsurprising.<br></p> <p>* <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/corruption-of-capitalism.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">The Corruption of Capitalism</a> by Guy Standing (Biteback, \u00a317.99).

    "webTitle": "Interest rate rises won\u2019t work if the Fed has misread the US labour market", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wall Street drew two conclusions from the news that the US jobs engine shifted down into a lower gear last month. The first \u2013 that a September increase in interest rates is now a non-starter \u2013 was almost certainly right. Putting up the cost of borrowing so close to the presidential election in early November always looked like an outside bet. It would have taken thunderously good figures for job creation to have persuaded the more dove-ish policymakers at the Federal Reserve to move, and the ones released on Friday were average at best. To be sure, the August non-farm payrolls have come in worse than expected for the past decade, suggesting that there might be some problem with the way the raw data is seasonally adjusted. What\u2019s more, the two previous months \u2013 June and July \u2013 saw strong increases in demand for labour, so the three-month average for non-farm payrolls is running at a healthy 200,000. That could persuade some of the hawks at the Fed to move, but they will not be able to muster a majority. The second conclusion drawn by Wall Street is more questionable. That is the assumption that the rate rise some analysts had pencilled in for September has now simply been put back to a later date. Some economists believe the Fed won\u2019t waste any time once US voters have chosen who will be Barack Obama\u2019s successor at the White House; some think the central bank will wait until March next year. There is, though, a different way of looking at the numbers. For most of this year, the strength of the US labour market has been at odds with data showing the economy growing only slowly. Sooner or later, the theory went, growth would accelerate and come into line with employment numbers, so justifying higher interest rates. But what if Wall Street has got things back to front? Is it possible that it is the labour market that has been giving off false signals and that eventually job creation will decelerate and come into line with a growth rate that averaged just 1% in the first half of 2016? There is enough evidence to make this a plausible hypothesis. Take the details of the most recent jobs report, for example. The annual growth rate in average hourly earnings fell to 2.4%, its lowest in six months, while average weekly hours worked declined to 34.3, the lowest in two and a half years. Hours worked by production and non-supervisory staff \u2013 who account for five out of six workers in the US \u2013 rose by 1.1% over the past year, the slowest rate of increase since 2010. None of this suggests the labour market is humming, nor that the recent pick-up in consumer spending \u2013 the economy\u2019s only real source of growth in the first half of the year \u2013 can be sustained. With investment weak and exports affected by low global demand and the lagged effects of the dollar\u2019s previous strength, it is not immediately obvious why the Fed would raise interest rates any time soon. Over the past couple of years, the US has succeeded in creating millions of jobs, but most of them are relatively unskilled and attract low pay. There is no obvious inflationary threat. Rather, the Fed should be focused on the risk that the economy might stall altogether. Corporate profits have come under pressure and this is leading to cuts in business investment. Historically, this is a good leading indicator that the US economy is heading into recession. The softness of the US economy is a concern to the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet Yellen, who has rightly adopted an ultra-cautious approach to raising rates. It will also be a concern for Hillary Clinton. The state of the economy does her no favours in her battle with Donald Trump. Now bosses actually have to ask not to get bonuses News that David Brown, chief executive of Go-Ahead Group, has asked not to be considered for a bonus this year prompts an obvious question: why did he think he might get one? Go-Ahead is the main company behind the chaotic Southern rail franchise that delivers daily misery to London commuters. If Brown\u2019s \u00a3558,000 bonus from a year ago had been repeated, riots might have broken out on station platforms. Not all Southern\u2019s woes can be laid at the operator\u2019s door, it should be said. The company doesn\u2019t control the tracks, which is where some of the problems have arisen as Network Rail gives London Bridge a major upgrade. But those difficulties have been compounded by Southern\u2019s bitter battle with the RMT union over plans to hand responsibility for closing train doors from conductors to drivers. Whatever the rights and wrong of the dispute, Southern\u2019s handling of the fallout has been appalling. Time and again, Brown has found himself apologising to customers for the sub-standard service. A bonus would have been another PR disaster. In practice, however, the bonus question arises because the rest of Go-Ahead is doing OK. The bus operations and other parts of the rail business are up to scratch. Despite losses at GTR \u2013 the unit that includes Southern \u2013 Go-Ahead\u2019s pre-tax profits rose 27% to \u00a399.8m. So Brown might have expected a juicy personal reward. But such a notion merely underlines the perversity of the modern bonus. No longer is it a reward for exceptional performance; instead, executives get them merely for delivering targets. In Go-Ahead\u2019s case, meeting the target \u2013 in other words, doing your job \u2013 is worth an extra 75% of salary in normal circumstances; at other companies, the ratio can be higher. This is a nonsense. Pay committees have become wedded to formulas that pay out even when disaster has struck in part of the empire. Boards should get a grip and apply common sense, which they are allowed to do. It should not have been a case of Brown doing \u201cthe right thing\u201d.

The Chinese, we are led to believe, would take offence and abandon Hinkley. Good. The plant would be hideously expensive for bill-payers and developer EDF\u2019s other two Hinkley-style developments outside the UK are years behind schedule.

      "body": "<p>Wall Street drew two conclusions from the news that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/sep/02/markets-await-crucial-us-jobs-report-business-live\" title=\"\">US jobs engine shifted down into a lower gear last month</a>. The first \u2013 that a September increase in interest rates is now a non-starter \u2013 was almost certainly right.</p> <p>Putting up the cost of borrowing so close to the presidential election in early November always looked like an outside bet. It would have taken thunderously good figures for job creation to have persuaded the more dove-ish policymakers at the Federal Reserve to move, and the ones released on Friday were average at best.</p> <p>To be sure, the August non-farm payrolls have come in worse than expected for the past decade, suggesting that there might be some problem with the way the raw data is seasonally adjusted. What\u2019s more, the two previous months \u2013 June and July \u2013 saw strong increases in demand for labour, so the three-month average for non-farm payrolls is running at a healthy 200,000. That could persuade some of the hawks at the Fed to move, but they will not be able to muster a majority.</p> <p>The second conclusion drawn by Wall Street is more questionable. That is the assumption that the rate rise some analysts had pencilled in for September has now simply been put back to a later date. Some economists believe the Fed won\u2019t waste any time once US voters have chosen who will be Barack Obama\u2019s successor at the White House; some think the central bank will wait until March next year.</p> <p>There is, though, a different way of looking at the numbers. For most of this year, the strength of the US labour market has been at odds with data showing the economy growing only slowly. Sooner or later, the theory went, growth would accelerate and come into line with employment numbers, so justifying higher interest rates.</p> <p>But what if Wall Street has got things back to front? Is it possible that it is the labour market that has been giving off false signals and that eventually job creation will decelerate and come into line with a growth rate that averaged just 1% in the first half of 2016?</p> <p>There is enough evidence to make this a plausible hypothesis. <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\" title=\"\">Take the details of the most recent jobs report</a>, for example. The annual growth rate in average hourly earnings fell to 2.4%, its lowest in six months, while average weekly hours worked declined to 34.3, the lowest in two and a half years.</p> <p>Hours worked by production and non-supervisory staff \u2013 who account for five out of six workers in the US \u2013 rose by 1.1% over the past year, the slowest rate of increase since 2010. None of this suggests the labour market is humming, nor that the recent pick-up in consumer spending \u2013 the economy\u2019s only real source of growth in the first half of the year \u2013 can be sustained.</p> <p>With investment weak and exports affected by low global demand and the lagged effects of the dollar\u2019s previous strength, it is not immediately obvious why the Fed would raise interest rates any time soon. Over the past couple of years, the US has succeeded in creating millions of jobs, but most of them are relatively unskilled and attract low pay. There is no obvious inflationary threat.</p> <p>Rather, the Fed should be focused on the risk that the economy might stall altogether. Corporate profits have come under pressure and this is leading to cuts in business investment. Historically, this is a good leading indicator that the US economy is heading into recession.</p> <p>The softness of the US economy is a concern to the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet Yellen, who has rightly adopted an ultra-cautious approach to raising rates. It will also be a concern for Hillary Clinton. The state of the economy does her no favours in her battle with Donald Trump.</p> <h2>Now bosses actually have to ask not to get bonuses</h2> <p>News that David Brown, chief executive of Go-Ahead Group, has asked not to be considered for a bonus this year prompts an obvious question: why did he think he might get one?</p> <p>Go-Ahead is the main company behind the chaotic Southern rail franchise that delivers daily misery to London commuters. If Brown\u2019s \u00a3558,000 bonus from a year ago had been repeated, riots might have broken out on station platforms.</p> <p>Not all Southern\u2019s woes can be laid at the operator\u2019s door, it should be said. The company doesn\u2019t control the tracks, which is where some of the problems have arisen as Network Rail gives London Bridge a major upgrade.</p> <p>But those difficulties have been compounded by Southern\u2019s bitter battle with the RMT union over plans to hand responsibility for closing train doors from conductors to drivers. Whatever the rights and wrong of the dispute, Southern\u2019s handling of the fallout has been appalling. Time and again, Brown has found himself apologising to customers for the sub-standard service. A bonus would have been another PR disaster.</p> <p>In practice, however, the bonus question arises because the rest of Go-Ahead is doing OK. The bus operations and other parts of the rail business are up to scratch. Despite losses at GTR \u2013 the unit that includes Southern \u2013 Go-Ahead\u2019s pre-tax profits rose 27% to \u00a399.8m. So Brown might have expected a juicy personal reward.</p> <p>But such a notion merely underlines the perversity of the modern bonus. No longer is it a reward for exceptional performance; instead, executives get them merely for delivering targets. In Go-Ahead\u2019s case, meeting the target \u2013 in other words, doing your job \u2013 is worth an extra 75% of salary in normal circumstances; at other companies, the ratio can be higher.</p> <p>This is a nonsense. Pay committees have become wedded to formulas that pay out even when disaster has struck in part of the empire. Boards should get a grip and apply common sense, which they are allowed to do. It should not have been a case of Brown doing \u201cthe right thing\u201d. His chairman should have said no bonuses would be paid because Go-Ahead was failing its customers.</p> <h2>The best way to stop Hinkley is to agree to it</h2> <p>What should Theresa May say to her Chinese G20 hosts about Hinkley Point? Nothing. The PM only ordered a review of the \u00a318bn project, which Beijing wants to part-fund, at the end of July. Hard conclusions probably haven\u2019t been reached.

Nice timing because it gave her team breathing space to work out what on earth to do about Brexit. MPs and peers are back tomorrow and economic policy will be under scrutiny. First up on Wednesday is the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, and fellow rate-setters at the Treasury select committee. After the Bank took what its chief economist, Andy Haldane, called a sledgehammer to monetary policy by cutting interest rates and printing more money, MPs will want to hear about their thinking on the impact and limits of monetary policy amid doubts about what rate cuts can achieve when they are close to zero. That should set things up for the Lords economic affairs committee to question chancellor Philip Hammond the next day. Being the Lords, it will no doubt be a civilised affair but peers should take the chance to press Hammond, in his first committee appearance, on what measures he is considering to give the economy a fiscal boost. Even City economists and businessmen such as Sir Martin Sorrell argue the government needs to step in to promote growth, for instance by spending on infrastructure. With Hammond\u2019s autumn statement not far off, what clues will he give to his thinking? Not such a fun summit There are no doubt times when prime ministers look forward to G20 meetings. You get to feel important and have your picture taken with other leaders of major economies, and it\u2019s usually a chance to get away for a few days. But Theresa May is unlikely to feel in this frame of mind at her first G20 summit, which takes place on Sunday and Monday. First, it\u2019s in China. Not only does that mean a gruelling 13-hour flight to Hangzhou, but when she gets there her hosts will demand to know what she\u2019s up to over Hinkley Point. A year ago, China agreed to fund a third of the \u00a318bn nuclear power station in Somerset on the understanding it would get to build two reactors of its own in Essex and Suffolk. May, who has long had doubts about the security implications of all this, put the project under review and one option appears to be going ahead with Hinkley but delaying a decision on the other two reactors. That would incense the Chinese, who want to showcase their nuclear abilities in Europe. Then there\u2019s Brexit and its potential to upset the global economy. May is tough, but she could face a gruelling time from her fellow leaders. High asking price at builder Following share-price plunges straight after the vote to leave the EU, most housebuilders that have reported results have been fairly upbeat. Persimmon, the biggest in the sector, said buyers paused for thought and then carried on viewing. There are more to come this week, including Barratt and Redrow, but the most interesting is Berkeley. The company could \u2013 or should \u2013 face a tough time at its annual meeting near its HQ in out-of-the-way Cobham, Surrey, on Tuesday when it will update on trading. Its shares have picked up a little since their initial drop after the referendum vote, but are still down 18%, and Berkeley is likely to drop out of the FTSE 100. While all this is going on, shareholders are being asked to approve \u00a321.5m in pay for chair Tony Pidgley, mainly from share options. Berkeley builds expensive homes in London whose prices have soared but are now falling fast. The average price of a home in the capital fell by \u00a330,000 in a month in July, according to estate agent Haart. No one knows what effect Brexit will eventually have on the property market, but it\u2019s fair to ask whether Pidgley, whose options date mainly from 2009, when the market was moribund, is raking in millions from a bubble that is bursting.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The leader of the Lib Dems, Tim Farron, struck a chord last week when he said that as a result of the Brexit vote, Britain had become a laughing stock abroad. He is quite right. I myself have been receiving baffled inquiries from friends overseas. And on two recent trips to get away from it all \u2013 to Crete and Provence, since you ask \u2013 we could not escape. Everyone we encountered \u2013 yes, everyone \u2013 asked why this country had taken leave of its senses. It is no good people saying we Remainers, or \u201cBrits-in\u201d as an acquaintance terms us, should shut up, accept that \u201cthe people have spoken\u201d and get on with it. This is the biggest crisis to erupt in my working life, and the implications are far too daunting to be taken lying down. Meanwhile, it is evident from its behaviour so far that the government is all over the place. But one thing is crystal clear: by making immigration the priority over membership of the single market, Theresa May is almost guaranteeing that, in order to offer sops to the Cerberus of burgeoning racism in this country, the economy will suffer. In the past 43 years of membership of the European Union for which successive prime ministers fought so hard, we have become an integral part of the European economy. In addition, until this summer, we enjoyed, in George Soros\u2019s words, \u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d \u2013 being beneficiaries of our trading relations with the rest of the EU, while outside the eurozone and the Schengen arrangement. While I have always been strongly European, I agreed with the many economists who argued that the eurozone was badly constructed, placing noble political aims over economic reality. The American economist and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, who is by no means anti-European, has delivered a powerful critique of the way the eurozone has produced lower growth than potential, and unnecessary and potentially dangerous levels of unemployment in nations that, frankly, were not qualified to join a fixed exchange rate system in which the principal beneficiary was Germany. Nevertheless, the decision not to sign up to the euro \u2013 a masterstroke on the part of Gordon Brown and Ed Balls \u2013 did not diminish the advantages of being in the single market. Big business, and many small businesses, operate at a European level, with supply chains all over the continent. They are accustomed to the existing laws and regulations. Moreover, our membership of the EU is the principal attraction for all that inward investment that governments of both major parties have successfully attracted over the decades. All this is being put at risk, as a result of craven acceptance of an \u201cadvisory\u201d referendum whose result was almost certainly determined by the false prospectus offered by the Brexiters. Even those in the Leave camp who complained that our sovereignty had been sacrificed to Brussels must wonder about a prime minister who last week brushed aside the sovereignty of our parliament when it comes to initiating negotiations with the rest of Europe. The following day, the health secretary reminded her and the rest of us that in this country \u201cwe don\u2019t have government by plebiscite\u201d. I meet many people who express the hope that May is playing a clever game. Knowing the incompatibility of the Brexiters\u2019 demands on immigration and continuing membership of the single market, and the years it would take to negotiate trade deals through the World Trade Organisation (WTO), they hope that the Brexiters will soon drive into a cul-de-sac, and normal service will be resumed. Of course, if the hit to the economy is as bad as one fears, we may find that net immigration from the EU reduces spontaneously as unemployed workers return home. Meanwhile, there is a vociferous element in the (mainly) rightwing, Eurosceptic press saying \u201cLook! The economy is fine. Brexit effect? What Brexit effect?\u201d Yes, consumers may have been on a spending spree during a remarkable summer, and London has been awash with tourists on shopping sprees, attracted by the cheap pound. Employment is still relatively high. But there are time lags in these matters. As Llewellyn Consulting has pointed out, investment plans are being cut back and the prospects for future growth are already deteriorating. Now, most commentators are agreed that the Bank of England, in common with other central banks, is running out of monetary ammunition, and fiscal policy \u2013 the use of government spending and tax cuts \u2013 should be brought in from the ideological cold. Indeed, on the eve of the G20 conference in China, US treasury secretary Jack Lew sounded an optimistic note about a resurgence of fiscal policy around the world. He even cited the UK. The UK? I hope so, but I wonder. A lot of hope has been placed on our new chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s references to the need to \u201creset\u201d fiscal policy. But there is a danger: remember the oracle at Delphi, whose ambiguous words could be open to dangerous misinterpretation? Noises emanating from the Treasury and the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggest there is already panic in the ranks about a prospective deterioration in the budgetary position as a result of the likely impact on tax revenues of Brexit. Might there be a reset in the wrong direction?",

      "body": "<p>The leader of the Lib Dems, Tim Farron, struck a chord last week when he said that as a result of the Brexit vote, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/31/brexit-vote-nigel-farage-making-uk-laughing-stock-abroad-tim-farron\" title=\"\">Britain had become a laughing stock abroad</a>.</p> <p>He is quite right. I myself have been receiving baffled inquiries from friends overseas. And on two recent trips to get away from it all \u2013 to Crete and Provence, since you ask \u2013 we could not escape. Everyone we encountered \u2013 yes, everyone \u2013 asked why this country had taken leave of its senses.</p> <p>It is no good people saying we Remainers, or \u201cBrits-in\u201d as an acquaintance terms us, should shut up, accept that \u201cthe people have spoken\u201d and get on with it. This is the biggest crisis to erupt in my working life, and the implications are far too daunting to be taken lying down.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it is evident from its behaviour so far that the government is all over the place. But one thing is crystal clear: by making immigration the priority over membership of the single market, Theresa May is almost guaranteeing that, in order to offer sops to the Cerberus of burgeoning racism in this country, the economy will suffer.</p> <p>In the past 43 years of membership of the European Union for which successive prime ministers fought so hard, we have become an integral part of the European economy. In addition, until this summer, we enjoyed, in George Soros\u2019s words, \u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d \u2013 being beneficiaries of our trading relations with the rest of the EU, while outside the eurozone and the Schengen arrangement.</p> <p>While I have always been strongly European, I agreed with the many economists who argued that the eurozone was badly constructed, placing noble political aims over economic reality. The American economist and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, who is by no means anti-European, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/10/joseph-stiglitz-the-problem-with-europe-is-the-euro\" title=\"\">has delivered a powerful critique</a> of the way the eurozone has produced lower growth than potential, and unnecessary and potentially dangerous levels of unemployment in nations that, frankly, were not qualified to join a fixed exchange rate system in which the principal beneficiary was Germany.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the decision not to sign up to the euro \u2013 a masterstroke on the part of Gordon Brown and Ed Balls \u2013 did not diminish the advantages of being in the single market. Big business, and many small businesses, operate at a European level, with supply chains all over the continent. They are accustomed to the existing laws and regulations. Moreover, our membership of the EU is the principal attraction for all that inward investment that governments of both major parties have successfully attracted over the decades.</p> <p>All this is being put at risk, as a result of craven acceptance of an \u201cadvisory\u201d referendum whose result was almost certainly determined by the false prospectus offered by the Brexiters.</p> <p>Even those in the Leave camp who complained that our sovereignty had been sacrificed to Brussels must wonder about a prime minister who last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/27/theresa-may-acting-like-tudor-monarch-in-denying-mps-a-vote-over-brexit\" title=\"\">brushed aside the sovereignty of our parliament</a> when it comes to initiating negotiations with the rest of Europe. The following day, the health secretary reminded her and the rest of us that in this country \u201cwe don\u2019t have government by plebiscite\u201d.</p> <p>I meet many people who express the hope that May is playing a clever game. Knowing the incompatibility of the Brexiters\u2019 demands on immigration and continuing membership of the single market, and the years it would take to negotiate trade deals through the World Trade Organisation (WTO), they hope that the Brexiters will soon drive into a cul-de-sac, and normal service will be resumed. Of course, if the hit to the economy is as bad as one fears, we may find that net immigration from the EU reduces spontaneously as unemployed workers return home.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there is a vociferous element in the (mainly) rightwing, Eurosceptic press saying \u201cLook! The economy is fine. Brexit effect? What Brexit effect?\u201d</p> <p>Yes, consumers may have been on a spending spree during a remarkable summer, and London has been awash with tourists on shopping sprees, attracted by the cheap pound. Employment is still relatively high. But there are time lags in these matters. As Llewellyn Consulting has pointed out, investment plans are being cut back and the prospects for future growth are already deteriorating.</p> <p>Now, most commentators are agreed that the Bank of England, in common with other central banks, is running out of monetary ammunition, and fiscal policy \u2013 the use of government spending and tax cuts \u2013 should be brought in from the ideological cold.</p> <p>Indeed, on the eve of the G20 conference in China, US treasury secretary Jack Lew sounded an optimistic note about a resurgence of fiscal policy around the world. He even cited the UK.</p> <p>The UK? I hope so, but I wonder. A lot of hope has been placed on our new chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s references to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36864099\" title=\"\">need to \u201creset\u201d fiscal policy</a>. But there is a danger: remember the oracle at Delphi, whose ambiguous words could be open to dangerous misinterpretation? Noises emanating from the Treasury and the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggest there is already panic in the ranks about a prospective deterioration in the budgetary position as a result of the likely impact on tax revenues of Brexit. Might there be a reset in the wrong direction?</p>",
