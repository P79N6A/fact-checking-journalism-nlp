The appointment was approved by David Cameron and the advisory committee on business appointments last week, although Deloitte did not announce the high-profile signing. The appointments committee added a list of six caveats to its approval letter, designed to ensure Hartnett does not share any information about how to avoid UK tax and to guard against potential conflicts of interest.

      "bodyText": "A Caribbean bank formerly co-owned by Barclays has been targeted by US tax authorities seeking information on suspected American tax evaders. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has filed a \"John Doe\" summons \u2013 a request for information on an unknown number of unnamed people \u2013 against US taxpayers with offshore accounts at FirstCaribbean International Bank (FCIB), who it suspects of having used accounts with the bank as parts of efforts to illegally evade US tax. The First Caribbean International Bank was formed in 2002 from the merger of Barclays' banking operations in the Caribbean and those of CIBC, a Caribbean bank. Barclays maintained a large shareholding in the resultant company of more than 40% until December 2006, when it sold the stake. The IRS request for information extends back to 2004, during the period of Barclays' co-ownership of FCIB, and also details some activity directly involving Barclays branches in the Caribbean before the formation of FCIB. A witness statement filed in support of the summons by IRS agent Cheryl Kiger details how, during her investigation into a leak of offshore data, she came across information suggesting FCIB and Barclays accounts may have been used by tax evaders. \"I discovered information about a US taxpayer (Taxpayer 1) who had opened numerous bank accounts at FCIB and its predecessor Barclays bank in a Caribbean jurisdiction in his own name and in the names of various shell companies he controlled,\" she wrote. \"Taxpayer 1 did not report any income arising from the transactions involving these FCIB accounts.\" Kiger also disclosed information obtained from a programme allowing individuals who have previously evaded US tax to voluntarily disclose this information and receive less stringent penalties. She identified at least 129 such cases which had involved the use of bank accounts with FCIB \"its predecessors in the Caribbean\". The summons uses the fact that the US bank Wells Fargo maintained \"correspondent\" accounts to access its offshore accounts from within the United States as part of the basis for its claim. The summons is seeking information on customers of FCIB or its predecessors who may have avoided US tax. It makes no application for information on the activities of the banks themselves, and nor does it suggest the banks had any intention of supporting, or direct knowledge of, such activities by their customers. However, they do detail how such private banking arrangements, and the use of \"correspondent\" accounts to allow easy access to such funds, help facilitate such potential tax evasion. \"The experience of the IRS has shown that not only private banking relationships can be used to conceal ownership of funds from tax authorities and others,\" said Kiger. \"The practice of offshore banks using correspondent accounts for the purpose of accessing the United States financial market and its banking customers has similarly received substantial attention\" The information request about people banking with FCIB is believed to be part of a cross-border investigation between tax authorities in the USA, UK and Australia \u2013 potentially the biggest in history \u2013 based on 260GB of leaked offshore documents, also obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and used by the Guardian for its Offshore Secrets series. The documents, which are internal databases and communications from two offshore incorporation bodies in the British Virgin Islands, contain multiple references to individuals moving funds between accounts owned by offshore companies with whom they have no official connection (thanks to \"sham\", or nominee directors) and accounts in their own names, including accounts at both Barclays, and then subsequently FCIB. The documents use the case of \"taxpayer 2\" to explain how these elaborate arrangements help people conceal their assets from tax authorities across the globe. \"Taxpayer 2 did not have direct signature authority over the FCIB account, but exercised actual authority through the nominal owner of his shell company, which followed his instructions with regard to the account,\" the declaration notes. A spokesman for Barclays said the bank had no link to the IRS investigation. \"Barclays sold its minority stake in this business in 2006 so any questions about First Caribbean should be addressed to that business,\" he said. \"The attempts to link any on-going investigation into First Caribbean to Barclays is disingenuous and misleading for your readers.\" A spokesman for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which has a majority stake in FCIB, said: \"We are committed to complying with all laws and regulatory requirements.

      "bodyText": "A batch of metal-studded belts sold by online fashion retailer Asos have been hurriedly withdrawn from sale after they were found to be radioactive. The peplum leather belts, which have a ruffle attached, could cause injury to the wearer if worn for more than 500 hours, according to an internal report by the retailer. They are being held in a radioactive storage facility after testing positive for Cobalt-60. The report, called Project Purple Flower and seen by the Guardian, said one of the brass-studded belts was pulled by US border control and tested positive. It led to a worldwide recall of the items, with 49 sold across 14 countries, but it is not known how many have been returned. The report said: \"None of these belts are suitable for public use or possession.\" It added: \"Unfortunately, this incident is quite a common occurrence. India and the far east are large consumers of scrap metal for their home and foreign markets. During the refining process of these metals, orphaned radioactive sources are sometimes accidentally melted at the same time. This in turn [contaminates the process] and traps the radioactivity in the metal as an alloy or in suspension.\" A spokesman for Asos said: \"A product supplied to Asos did not meet UK health and safety standards. Asos worked with all relevant authorities and undertook a precautionary product recall, in line with our high standards of quality and customer care. No other Asos product lines are affected. \"Asos continues to work with the relevant regulatory authorities and is in dialogue with the supplier and the factory workers involved to ensure a satisfactory outcome.\" But a row has now broken out between Asos and the Indian group accused by the company of supplying the belts. Haq International, which had been a supplier to Asos for more than a year, sold 641 belts to that are said to be radioactive. However, Faizan Haq, the boss of the supplier, has been refused permission to inspect the belts, with Asos telling him that counter-terrorism agencies believe he is a security risk, despite the father-of-one having no criminal record. Documents seen by the Guardian show that the belts Asos claims are contaminated do not match the description of the belts supplied by Haq, or any of the 30 products supplied by the firm. Despite this, Asos is demanding \u00a3100,000 from the supplier in recall charges and has withheld \u00a364,000 owed to the businessman, who has had to cancel orders with Miss Selfridge and shut his factory for five months, leaving 18 Indian workers without jobs. He claims he has also had to sell his car to hire his own lawyers. The belts being held as a result of Project Purple Flower have 801 metal studs and weigh 316g, while the peplum belts Haq supplied, which come in four sizes, contain a maximum of 750 brass studs, with the smallest size weighing 370g. Asos claims codes on the boxes with the contaminated belts match those supplied by Haq and that the discrepancies over the number of metal studs is due to the belts all being handmade. Independent tests by the Health Protection Agency at Haq's London warehouse found there was no radiation from any of the belts and metal stored there, while in India the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board carried out an inspection that has not been shared with him. Project Purple Flower confirmed that the majority of the 801 brass studs in the belts were contaminated. However, Asos uses several different belt suppliers. In the Uttar Pradesh province in northern India, workers at the Royal Ascot Leather factory, who earn less than \u00a350 a month, have taken to holding daily protests outside the closed building. They are demanding Asos gives them their jobs back and are burning effigies of Asos bosses. Haq, who has run his business for eight years, said: \"My life has been ruined by this huge company, which claims to look after its suppliers. \"I have been writing to Asos for months now in an attempt to see the belts they claim are mine, but I've been turned away and fobbed off, and now I'm being told I'm banned from inspecting them.\" Asos has since offered to pay Haq \u00a324,000 of the \u00a364,000 he is owed, but he has still not been able to see the belts since the issue was first raised in a meeting with senior Asos buyers in December last year.",

However, Asos uses several different belt suppliers.</p> <p>In the Uttar Pradesh province in northern India, workers at the Royal Ascot Leather factory, who earn less than \u00a350 a month, have taken to holding daily protests outside the closed building.</p> <p>They are demanding Asos gives them their jobs back and are burning effigies of Asos bosses. Haq, who has run his business for eight years, said: \"My life has been ruined by this huge company, which claims to look after its suppliers.</p> <p>\"I have been writing to Asos for months now in an attempt to see the belts they claim are mine, but I've been turned away and fobbed off, and now I'm being told I'm banned from inspecting them.\"</p> <p>Asos has since offered to pay Haq \u00a324,000 of the \u00a364,000 he is owed, but he has still not been able to see the belts since the issue was first raised in a meeting with senior Asos buyers in December last year.</p>",
