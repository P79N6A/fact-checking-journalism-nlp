      "bodyText": "Banking scion Nat Rothschild is forming a consortium to launch a counter-offer for Bumi, the mining firm he set up, in a bitter battle against the powerful Indonesian Bakrie family. The struggle over Bumi, which was brought to the London Stock Exchange by Rothschild with the backing of one of Jakarta's most powerful families, including presidential candidate Aburizal Bakrie, has seen the two dynasties fall out spectacularly. Rothschild is planning to team up with another Indonesian presidential candidate, Prabowo Subianto, among others, to thwart the Bakrie's $1.4bn (\u00a3867m) plans to buy out Bumi, according to Reuters. The Bakries had planned to quit Bumi and dismantle the company by buying back the stakes the plc has in two coal mines \u2013 Bumi Resources and Berau Coal Energy. News of a counter offer by Rothschild sent Bumi shares up 14% to 283p, however they are still a long way off their \u00a310 flotation price. The buyout plan by the Bakries involves swapping their Bumi Plc shares for part of the 29% stake in Bumi Resources held by the London-listed company, then buying the rest of the stake for cash, before acquiring Bumi Plc's 85% stake in Berau. Buying out the 29% stake is seen as straightforward, but prising away from the London listed company its 85% stake for Berau \u2013 Indonesia's fourth largest coal mine \u2013 could prove more difficult. Rothschild quit the board as a non-executive director after the Bakries made their offer to buy out the company, saying it would not be in the interests of shareholders to accept the deal. He said at the time: \"It will be a disgrace to proceed with, or even to entertain the proposal.\" He was forced out as co-chairman after writing to the Bakries demanding a clean up of the company's operations. The resignation came soon after the London-listed company launched an investigation into \"financial irregularities\" at Bumi Resources in Indonesia, after a whistleblower in Jakarta sent documents relating, in part, to a \u00a3198m writedown the company made last year on a business owned by a member of the board. Since Rothschild stood down, the mudslinging between him, the Bakries, and Bumi chief executive Samin Tan \u2013 a Bakrie ally \u2013 has continued. Emails emerged last month revealing that Rothschild was told if he did not step down, Tan and senior non-executive director, Sir Julian Horn-Smith, would leave. Tan said Rothschild had been persistently disruptive, and had hinted he could send the businessman to jail suggesting he had been hacking Tan's emails.Rothschild denies all the allegations, calling them untrue and defamatory. It is thought any deal Rothschild hopes to agree would see Bumi remain as a London-listed company with interests in Indonesian mining. Talks between several parties are ongoing with numerous businessmen being courted by Rothschild as he attempts to repair his reputation from the Bumi fallout. In response to the rise in the share price Bumi issued a statement saying: \"Bumi plc notes the movement in its share price following a number of articles in the media on a possible proposal from Nat Rothschild.

But it was a different story for staff at stricken electricals chain Comet who were dealing with a different type of scrum as shoppers rushed to spend vouchers and collect purchases before administrators from Deloitte took charge. The formal appointment of Deloitte ended the uncertainty hanging over the 236 store chain and its 6,611 staff, and with no white knight-style buyer waiting in the wings, its financial collapse stands out as one of the darkest days for the embattled high street since the demise of Woolworths four years ago. \"Our immediate priorities are to stabilise the business and begin an urgent process to seek a suitable buyer which would also preserve jobs,\" said Deloitte partner Neville Kahn.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hundreds of post offices face an uncertain future after the award of a \u00a3600m contract to provide driving licences and tax discs was delayed by the government, say MPs and unions. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) had been expected to award the contract in October, with the Post Office and bill payment service Paypoint submitting bids, but it will not be decided until the end of November. It is feared that if the contract ends up in the hands of a private contractor new laws would have to be passed for the company to issue tax discs. Post office unions believe the uncertainty is hurting its members, who rely on up to 20% of their revenues on the DVLA contract, which ends in March 2013. George Thomson, general secretary of the National Federation of SubPostmasters said: \"The DVLA contract is essential to the future of our post offices. \"The ongoing delay in announcing a decision on the contract is having a highly unsettling effect on the national post office network and on individual subpostmasters' ability to plan for the future. \"Certainly, if the contract isn't awarded exclusively to the Post Office, it would be catastrophic for the UK's post offices \u2013 thousands of branches may be forced to close and the government's policy on the post office network will be left in tatters.\" Ministers have consistently said they want the Post Office to become the front office for government, with the transport department saying it should act \"as a natural home for the delivery of face-to-face government services and helping citizens interact with government online.\" However, shadow Postal affairs minister, Ian Murray warned the government is failing in its commitment. He said: \"Post Offices are under real strain at the moment and this was a real opportunity to give them a boost and for the government to show how seriously they want to support it. \"I'm surprised by how long it's been delayed when there are only two bidders. \"However, I have been told that a legislative change would have to go through if the contract was handed to Paypoint to sell tax discs. I hope that's not the reason for the delay.\" He said he has written to the Department for Transport, which makes the final decision, asking for an explanation for the delay. Politicians have been inundated with letters from constituents calling for the DVLA contract to be renewed with the Post Office, as many fear it could lead to further closures. Mike Weir, SNP MP for Angus, said: \"I cannot remember a campaign like this. A really surprising amount of people feel strongly about this and I would hope the government and DVLA are watching. \"Hopefully the delay could be a ray of light as the sit up and take notice of the support for the Post Offices.\" Liberal Democrat peer, Baroness Rosalind Scott, agreed and said the topic has been discussed at her local council, leading her to raise the issue in the House of Lords. She said: \"Post offices hold things together and the danger is its like a game of giant Jenga; you pull one block out and the whole thing falls down. \"What post offices want is some certainty about the way forward. They want to plan ahead like all businesses and know what to invest in. It's beginning to get desperately close to the wire with a decision made at Christmas over a contract that starts in March.\" A spokesman for the DVLA said: \"We have completed the evaluation process and we will announce the contract award in due course following final governance steps. We hope to make an announcement during November.\"",

I hope that's not the reason for the delay.\"</p> <p>He said he has written to the Department for Transport, which makes the final decision, asking for an explanation for the delay.</p> <p>Politicians have been inundated with letters from constituents calling for the DVLA contract to be renewed with the Post Office, as many fear it could lead to further closures.</p> <p>Mike Weir, SNP MP for Angus, said: \"I cannot remember a campaign like this. A really surprising amount of people feel strongly about this and I would hope the government and DVLA are watching.</p> <p>\"Hopefully the delay could be a ray of light as the sit up and take notice of the support for the Post Offices.\"</p> <p>Liberal Democrat peer, Baroness Rosalind Scott, agreed and said the topic has been discussed at her local council, leading her to raise the issue in the House of Lords.</p> <p>She said: \"Post offices hold things together and the danger is its like a game of giant Jenga; you pull one block out and the whole thing falls down.</p> <p>\"What post offices want is some certainty about the way forward. They want to plan ahead like all businesses and know what to invest in. It's beginning to get desperately close to the wire with a decision made at Christmas over a contract that starts in March.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the DVLA said: \"We have completed the evaluation process and we will announce the contract award in due course following final governance steps. We hope to make an announcement during November.\"</p>",

It bounced back from a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/02/ikea-dixons-retail-gloom-consumer-confidence?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">3% drop in sales</a> the year before when hard-up households put home makeovers on the back burner. Some 41 million people came through its doors in the past year, including more affluent shoppers looking for affordable furniture.</p> <p>Ikea bucked the trend of falling big-ticket sales \u2013 the UK market as a whole was down 2.2% \u2013 and increased market share by 0.4% to 6.8%. Online like-for-like sales leapt 25% after a further 1,500 products were made available, taking the total on its website to 6,000 (out of Ikea's 9,500-strong product range).</p> <p>Carole Reddish, acting manager for the UK and Ireland, said the company had done more than 500 home visits in the past year and redesigned its shop floor displays, in particular bedrooms, to reflect people's changing living situation. More grown-up children are coming back home after backpacking or university to live with their parents because they cannot afford to rent or buy their own home.</p> <p>\"You need a grown-up space rather than the teenage space that you left,\" said Reddish. \"Families are staying together longer or moving back together. More people are taking care of their [elderly] parents. We're also living in very small spaces. We have a lot of stuff and don't know where to put it.\"</p> <p>Like-for-like sales of bedrooms climbed 16.7%, after Ikea lowered the price of its most popular bedroom storage range, Pax. Prices were reduced by 0.6% overall, following a 5% reduction the year before. Ikea invested \u00a34.7m in slashing the cost of home deliveries from an average of \u00a335 to \u00a315-\u00a325. New in-store \"pick and delivery\" and \"furniture take back\" services were also launched.</p> <p>As it celebrates its 25th anniversary in the UK, the company has sought to brighten up its functional stores by introducing workshops on how to personalise furniture and accessories, canap\u00e9-making classes ahead of Christmas and sampling from its Swedish food market.</p> <p>Reddish said it was about \"bringing theatre to the shopping experience\". The retailer also plans to introduce Wi-Fi.</p> <p>Ikea has won planning permission from West Berkshire Council to build its 19th UK store in Reading \u2013 and aims to double the current number of outlets. It has revamped its Warrington store with a \u00a31m new market hall, where smaller items are sold, and will roll out the new market halls to Manchester, London and the rest of its UK shops.

The Swedish company said a \u00a330m investment in its 18 UK stores and website had paid off, with like-for-like sales in the UK and Ireland climbing 6.3% to \u00a31.2bn in the year to 31 August - the biggest increase in six years. It bounced back from a 3% drop in sales the year before when hard-up households put home makeovers on the back burner. Some 41 million people came through its doors in the past year, including more affluent shoppers looking for affordable furniture. Ikea bucked the trend of falling big-ticket sales \u2013 the UK market as a whole was down 2.2% \u2013 and increased market share by 0.4% to 6.8%. Online like-for-like sales leapt 25% after a further 1,500 products were made available, taking the total on its website to 6,000 (out of Ikea's 9,500-strong product range). Carole Reddish, acting manager for the UK and Ireland, said the company had done more than 500 home visits in the past year and redesigned its shop floor displays, in particular bedrooms, to reflect people's changing living situation. More grown-up children are coming back home after backpacking or university to live with their parents because they cannot afford to rent or buy their own home. \"You need a grown-up space rather than the teenage space that you left,\" said Reddish. \"Families are staying together longer or moving back together. More people are taking care of their [elderly] parents. We're also living in very small spaces. We have a lot of stuff and don't know where to put it.\" Like-for-like sales of bedrooms climbed 16.7%, after Ikea lowered the price of its most popular bedroom storage range, Pax. Prices were reduced by 0.6% overall, following a 5% reduction the year before. Ikea invested \u00a34.7m in slashing the cost of home deliveries from an average of \u00a335 to \u00a315-\u00a325. New in-store \"pick and delivery\" and \"furniture take back\" services were also launched. As it celebrates its 25th anniversary in the UK, the company has sought to brighten up its functional stores by introducing workshops on how to personalise furniture and accessories, canap\u00e9-making classes ahead of Christmas and sampling from its Swedish food market. Reddish said it was about \"bringing theatre to the shopping experience\". The retailer also plans to introduce Wi-Fi. Ikea has won planning permission from West Berkshire Council to build its 19th UK store in Reading \u2013 and aims to double the current number of outlets. It has revamped its Warrington store with a \u00a31m new market hall, where smaller items are sold, and will roll out the new market halls to Manchester, London and the rest of its UK shops.

      "bodyText": "This weekend's G20 meeting should not concentrate exclusively on the eurozone crisis to the detriment of other urgent issues such as the \"fiscal cliff\" facing the US and Japan's debt problems, said German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble. Speaking to Reuters ahead of the meeting, Schauble said: The US and Japan bear as great a responsibility for [ensuring stability] as we Europeans. Schauble said Spain was on the \"right path\" and there were some signs that its economic imbalances were improving. He said Greece must implement the tough measures it has promised. But Schauble dampened expectations that the bailout fund, the ESM, could soon recapitalise banks directly, reiterating the view that an oversight body must first be fully functional. It is important that liability and control go hand-in-hand. In other words, quality clearly comes before speed. And with that, I'm afraid we're closing the blog early again today. Thanks, as ever, for all your comments. A quick look at the markets, which seem relatively unmoved by the positive jobs data out of the US. US Dow Jones: down 0.39% UK FTSE 100: down 0.1%, or 6 points, at 5857 points German DAX: up 0.44% France CAC 40: up 0.36% Spain IBEX: up 0.44% Greece will auction \u20ac1bn of six-month Treasury bills on Tuesday, the country's debt agency PDMA said today, to refinance \u20ac1.6bn of debt that is maturing. These monthly T-bill sales are Greece's only remaining source of market funding. Capital Economics, meanwhile, argue that the US jobs report is neither strong enough nor weak enough to have any marked impact on the presidential election. The analysts conclude: Overall, this report is sure to be spun politically by both sides. The bottom line is that the labour market remains unusually weak, but whether it is weak enough to prevent Obama getting re-elected is anyone's guess. While many have said the US jobs report gives a big boost to Obama, Bill Gross of bond trader PIMCO says it could fade into insignificance compared with fallout from Hurricane Sandy. Back to the eurozone... while bets are laid on who will be the first to leave, Latvia is hoping to join the single currency in 2014. The country aims to ask EU authorities early next year to assess whether it will be ready to adopt the euro in 2014. Reuters reports: Entering the eurozone in two years has been a clear goal for the centre-right government after years of austerity which followed a brutal 2009 recession. Latvia says it has already met the economic criteria to adopt the single currency. Sticking with the US jobs report, it is worth noting that the number of people actively looking for work ticked up. That, in turn, led to the slight increase in the unemployment rate as only people who are currently looking for a job count as unemployed. James Knightley at ING Bank said the figures suggest the economy will grow in the fourth quarter. With the unemployment rate trending downwards and the economy adding jobs this is boosting incomes and the feeling of job security. It is encouraging to see this evaluation backed up by the rise in the Conference Board measure of consumer confidence yesterday, which stands at a four and a half year high. These are all good outcomes and offer hope that the fourth quarter GDP numbers won\u2019t be too bad. However, the uncertainty regarding the fiscal cliff remains a major concern and the longer the post-election arguments drag on, the more damaging it will be for the economy and for jobs. Most analysts agree, it was a good report and the overall trend in jobs in the US is going in the right direction. Mitt Romney did not: Today's increase in the unemployment rate is a sad reminder that the economy is at a virtual standstill. The jobless rate is higher than it was when President Obama took office, and there are still 23 million Americans struggling for work. Joe Weisenthal of Business Insider, for one, thinks the US jobs numbers will provide a pretty conclusive boost for Obama. Some analyst comment on the US jobs figures. Peter Cardillo, at Rockwell Global Capital, is a little circumspect: On the surface the numbers were much better than expected, but I suspect that if you take into consideration two months of upward revisions that means we're averaging close to 130,000 to 140,000 in non-farm payrolls, which is not yet sufficient to powerhouse the labour market and give a big boost to economic activity. David Sloan, economist at 4Cast: Generally it is positive \u2013 the payrolls were strong and the unemployment rate sustained most of its fall from last month. So the unemployment rate at 7.9% was bang in line with expectations. It's a touch higher than September's rate of 7.8%. In terms of the payroll numbers, there were big revisions up for the past two months, with the change in total non-farm payrolls for August revised from +142k to +192k and September revised from +114k to +148k. The statistics office said: Hurricane Sandy had no discernable effect on the employment and unemployment data for October. Household survey data collection was completed before the storm, and establishment survey data collection rates were within normal ranges nationally and for the affected areas. Some reaction from Twitter... US non-farm payrolls added 171,000 jobs in October, beating expectations of a rise of 125,000. The jobless rate inched up to 7.9%. That is good news for Obama, as it will support his case that the economy is on the mend. Spain's lifeline will leave the euro tied in knots, writes Stephen King, chief economist at HSBC, in today's Times. King argues that the ECB's plan to buy up the bonds of crisis-hit countries, providing that they follow a series of strict conditions, is fundamentally flawed. Spain may not be in Greece\u2019s terrible position but it is, nevertheless, in danger of being damned if it does and damned if it doesn\u2019t. Accepting the austerity and restructuring conditions set by others might well lead to lower interest rates but, as the UK knows only too well, lower rates alone are not enough to guarantee recovery. In Spain, the risk would be of continuing economic weakness pushing tax revenues lower and government debt higher. Rejecting those conditions, however, would leave Spain facing ever higher interest rates. Worse, a rejection would reopen the wounds Mr Draghi sought to heal, raising more questions about the single currency. Even if it does opt into the scheme and its borrowing costs plunge, he writes, Spain must become more competitive: that means price and wage cuts. Yet price and wage cuts will only make the debt problem worse: deflation is the debtor\u2019s biggest enemy. Spain simultaneously needs both deflation and inflation. That\u2019s tricky. His solution is a single European economy to match the single currency, so German foreign direct investment pours into Spain, while the Spanish unemployed pour into Germany. If the euro is to survive, there will almost certainly have to be a fiscal union. There may even have to be some form of debt forgiveness. More than anything else, however, there has to be a single economy to match the single currency. Over to Greece where our correspondent Helena Smith says fears are growing over the possibility of defections scuppering next week\u2019s crucial vote on the \u20ac13.5bn austerity package that is key to unlocking further aid. She writes: With D-Day looming ahead of next Wednesday\u2019s vote on the measures, the Greek government is trying to put on a brave face. Emerging from talks this morning with prime minister Antonis Samaras, Athens\u2019 eternally upbeat finance minister, Yiannis Stournaras, said he was \u201cquite optimistic\u201d that the controversial package would ultimately be ratified by the crisis-hit country\u2019s 300-seat House. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget after the Greek parliament, the parliaments of member states of quite a few other countries will also vote on the disbursement [of the \u20ac31.5bn aid installment Greece stands to receive once the measures are approved],\u201d he told reporters. \u201cSo we have to be very, very careful.\u201d Helena continues: But his optimism is not shared by other MPs in the three parties participating in Samaras\u2019 fragile coalition. Rebellion is growing within the ranks of socialist Pasok party following the defections of two high-profile members this week and amid mounting signs that its leader Evangelos Venizelos has lost control. \u201cIt\u2019s a very worrying situation with more and more deputies just not wanting to put their names to spending cuts that could send Greece spinning out of control,\u201d said one insider. \u201cIt\u2019s a war situation because Venizelos has made it clear that if MPs don\u2019t endorse the measures they will be kicked out.\u201d Analysts say there is growing evidence that deputies in Samaras\u2019 centre-right New Democracy party will also break ranks \u2013 along with MPs from the small Democratic Left party who remain steadfast in their refusal to back labour reforms that the EU and IMF say are vital if Greece is to become more competitive. International creditors have signalled they want the coalition, which controls 176 seats, to pass the measures with at least 155 votes. \u201cIf revolt and defections continue, there is a real possibility the latest austerity measures \u2026 may not survive a vote,\u201d said former Pasok MP Elena Panaritis. \"If this occurs, both Pasok and the coalition government will most likely collapse.\u201d So many things could go wrong next week, writes Matthew Boesler on Business Insider. With presidential elections in the U.S. and a critical vote in Greece, the week ahead is going to be even bigger, and markets are going to have even more to digest in a short period of time \u2013 event risk is back. On top of those major events, Spain has a big bond auction, while the ECB and Bank of England are both holding monthly policy meetings. But for now the markets are marking time ahead of the release. UK FTSE 100: down 0.07%, or 4 points, at 5858 points France CAC 40: down 0.17% Germany DAX: down 0.03% Spain IBEX: up 0.25% Italy FTSE MIB: down 0.63% Today's jobs report [out of the US at 12.30pm] will be the last before next week's presidential election, and a strong reading could give support to Obama's case that the economy is on the mend, reports Ransquawk. The consensus forecast is for unemployment to edge up to 7.9%. Non-farm payrolls \u2013 which account for around 80% of the workers who produce US GDP \u2013 are expected to show an increase of around 125,000 workers. Ransquawk notes that the market reaction to a much higher number for non-farms could be confused by a recent announcement from the Fed that it would help stimulate the economy \"until employment growth is satisfactory\". If employment growth looks healthy, the market might be worried that it will cut back its quantitative easing programme. Nationalised Spanish banks sack workers and close branches before accessing any bailout money, said Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, vice president of the European Commission. Spain's central bank should carry out more reforms in the banks it has nationalised before EU member states release bailout funds. Almunia said the Spanish rescue fund Frob, which is the biggest shareholder in Bankia, CatalunyaCaixa, Novagalicia and Banco de Valencia, should push for these reforms to happen immediately. And then she's off to Portugal. Reports on Twitter suggest Merkel will visit the prime minister and president of Portugal and visit a Volkswagen factory on November 12. German chancellor Angela Merkel will meet David Cameron in London next Wednesday for what should be a lively meeting. Cameron has said he wants a freeze on the EU budget and is under mounting pressure to toughen his stance further after his defeat in parliament at the hands of eurosceptic rebels who want a real-terms cut in the budget. Since then, France and Denmark have also threatened to block a deal. In the face of growing insubordination, Merkel said yesterday: I don't want to throw more vetoes into the room, it doesn't help bring about a solution. We've got some analyst comment coming in on the UK construction figures (see 9.41am). Despite the headline figure that showed the sector had grown very slightly, Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says the survey failed to mask the underlying weakness in construction. Even if the construction sector can avoid further contraction in the fourth quarter, it certainly looks unrealistic to expect it to materially contribute to growth. So with the corresponding manufacturing sector pointing to weakness in October, any fourth-quarter growth be heavily reliant on ongoing expansion in the dominant services sector. It will also likely need reasonably decent consumer spending. Archer looks at the reasons behind the weakness in the sector, which has declined by almost 11% in the past year. The construction sector continues to be hampered by major headwinds, notably including public spending cuts, an extended weak economy, a struggling housing sector, and problems in getting funding for large-scale projects. In particular, the government\u2019s spending cuts are limiting overall expenditure on public buildings, schools and hospitals. Italian prime minister Mario Monti has given an excellent interview to Les Echos (in French). In it he says: For Germany, economics is a branch of moral philosophy. Growth is the prize for ethical behaviour. On the part of the individual \u2013 by saving \u2013 and on the part of the group \u2013 through budgetary equilibrium. He said he has made it a point of honour never to use the argument: \"It's difficult, but it is what the European Commission demands\". I have always tried to explain that the potion is certainly bitter, but it must be administered for the good of the country and future generations. Otherwise we pollute the European spirit. He adds that Italians do think the reforms are painful, but says his government remains popular David Cameron is the most eurosceptic leader we have ever had, suggests a blogpost on Conservative Home. Unlike Edward Heath who took us into the EEC, unlike Margaret Thatcher who took us into the ERM, unlike John Major who took us into Maastricht, there can be no doubt that the general direction of travel under David Cameron is away from Europe, not towards it. The writer notes that the UK is preparing to pull out of almost all areas of justice and home affairs, the third pillar of EU jurisdiction. And they quote Ambrose Evans Pritchard of the Telegraph, who sees this as part of a much wider process of British disengagement from the EU. He writes: It is now clear that Britain's decision to stay out of the euro at Maastricht was a de facto decision to leave the EU as well\u2026 It has a taken two decades but we can almost all see now that a free and self-governing Britain can no longer be part of the Project. The UK construction data has little relation to GDP numbers, Rob Wood at Berenberg Bank said, placing the empahsis on Monday's services figures. A bit of positive news on the UK today, as construction output stabilised in October according to the latest PMI. The release has only a loose relationship with output growth, so we cannot draw strong conclusions. We will have to wait until Monday\u2019s key service sector PMI survey before judging the growth momentum heading into Q4. But any good news on construction is welcome given that the sector has seen an 11% fall in output so far this year. If construction stops detracting from GDP growth, it would be helpful for the economy\u2019s growth prospects Taking a closer look at those construction figures out of the UK (see below), the survey showed that although output rose marginally, new work dropped for the fifth month running, which bodes ill for the coming months. A lack of new work led to companies shedding staff in October and an ongoing decline in the use of sub-contractors. Tim Moore at Markit said: The bigger picture remains bleak given ongoing falls in new orders alongside renewed job cuts across the sector over the month. Construction firms are seeing the most protracted period of new business losses since 2008/09, meaning an escalating shortage of work to replace completed projects. Shocking construction figures out of the UK show the sector actually grew in October. The Markit/CIPS construction PMI ticked up to 50.9 from 49.5 in September, just above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. A pretty chart from Markit showing the various eurozone country's differing fortunes. Note the trajector of Ireland, in a bailout programme, compared with Germany. The eurozone almost certainly fell into recession in the third quarter, and this manufacturing data suggests output will continue to decline in the fourth, said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. As a result, he expects that the ECB will ultimately take interest rates down from 0.75% to 0.5%. We don\u2019t expect the ECB to loosen monetary policy at their 8 November meeting but we have pencilled an interest rate cut to 0.50% in December on the assumption that continuing weak economic data and surveys over the coming weeks will increasingly convince the ECB that lower interest rates are warranted. Arhcer noted that manufacturers saw their costs rise in October, but could not increase prices because of weak demand and strong competition, meaning profit margins were squeezed. Overall, the eurozone composite manufacturing PMI dropped to 45.4 from 46.1 in September. Ireland was the only country to see its manufacturing sector grow, with all the other readings below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Rob Dobson at Markit said: Contractions were seen in all nations except Ireland, with the majority reporting faster rates of decline than in September. This is further evidence that the ongoing weakness of the periphery is being combined with hollowing out of the previously strong core of France and Germany. And finally, German manufacturing is also in decline, confirming fears that the trouble in the eurozone has reached right to the core. Falling demand in Europe and lower levels of investment in Asia weighed on new orders for German products. The Markit/BME manufacturing PMI dropped to 46 from 47.4 in September. France's factory sector is also in decline, although the index picked up slightly from a dismal reading in September. The Markit/CDAF PMI rose to 43.7 in October, from 43.7 the previous month. A lack of new orders and falling exports pose a growing risk of recession in the fourth quarter. Some more detail on the Italian factory numbers. Output and new work dropped substantially in October. As a result, Italian manufacturers cut both production levels and staff numbers. In a rare piece of good news, new export orders did increase for first time in seven months. Phil Smith at Markit said: More or less the only positive that can be taken from the latest data was a rise in export orders, though, as a result of continued weakness in key trading partners Franceand Germany, the rate of growth was modest and far from sufficient to offset a further downturn in domestic demand. Italy's economy has been the most sluggish in the eurozone for more than a decade. It shrank by 0.8% in the first and second quarters and the government expects output to drop by 2.4% this year. Now it's Italy's turn and it does not look good. Italy's manufacturing sector shrank for the 15th month in a row in October, suggesting the country is struggling to get out of recession. The Markit/ADACI PMI dropped to 45.5, down from 45.7 last month, in line with analyst expectations. Taking a closer look at Spain's disappointing manufacturing data, output and new orders fell more rapidly, while input costs rose sharply. Worryingly, the survey noted the fastest fall in purchasing activity since April 2009. (The PMI summarises the opinions of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector, who gauge future demand and adjust orders for materials accordingly.) Andrew Harker, economist at Markit, said: The start of the final quarter of the year saw no end to the problems affecting the Spanish manufacturing sector as the economic crisis continued to hit demand. One potential source of comfort from the latest survey was a stabilisation in new export orders, providing hope that growth in external demand may reappear by the end of the year. However, evidence from panellists suggests that any rise in exports would not be enough to compensate for the substantial domestic downturn, as highlighted by the sharp and accelerated reduction in total new business in October. The Spanish manufacturing sector shrank at a faster rate than feared in October. The PMI came in at 43.5, while analysts were hoping for 44.1. The reading dropped from 44.6 in September, falling further away from the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. European Council president Herman Van Rompuy was pushing for greater trade links with Vietnam in a speech in Ho Chin Minh this morning. We need a comprehensive and ambitious free trade agreement to encourage structural reforms and to achieve improved market access in Vietnam, he said. The FTA negotiations will thus require effort, vision and commitment from both the EU and Vietnam, he added. Sticking with Greece, a senior economic adviser at Deutsche Bank delivered a damning assessment of the country's progress on Bloomberg TV this morning. Thomas Mayer said the international creditors should let Greece's bailout programme expire and the European bailout fund, the ESM, should take over and run its banks. Ideally, one should have let this program now expiring because it is not working. What we should have done is to change the approach. Do a specific bank restructuring exercise so at least the banks are afloat. Take them over and have the ESM run the Greek banks so they have a banking system. And then offer help through the European Investment Bank and through structured funds. But basically say that the macro program does not work. Greece must help itself to fix the crisis, Andreas Dombret, Bundesbank board member, said last night. Dombret chastised the country for being far behind in its reform programme, saying it should not rely on international creditors to solve its problems. Bloomberg cited him saying: Announcing and passing laws is not enough if the administration and the general public undermine them. It is now the task of the troika to decide impartially whether Greece meets the conditions for further assistance. He was, however, full of praise for Ireland, which is fast becoming the darling of the international creditors. Dombret said that, while Greece has come to a standstill over basic structural reforms, other countries are making progress. My favourite example is Ireland, which shows that trust can be regained if the agreed measures are adopted and implemented. [US spelling corrected - thank you KhakiSuit] Today Joaquin Almunia, vice-president of the European Commission is speaking in Italy, while the globe-trotting president of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy is out in Vietnam.

This morning we've got construction data out of the UK, which is expected to be dire. And more manufacturing data from the eurozone, which will likely confirm last week's bleak prognosis that problems in the periphery have spread to the core. We'll be keeping an eye on Greece, where the coalition faces an extremely tense few days ahead of the votes in parliament next week over austerity. Rising dissent in the PASOK Socialist party could leave the government without the necessary support to pass the measures. The IMF said yesterday that there were \u201cmany options\u201d to help reduce Greece's debt burden, which should be considered.

      "body": "<p>The US added 171,000 new jobs in October, far higher than expected and handing president Barack Obama's campaign a major boost four days before the election.</p> <p>It was the 25th consecutive month of jobs growth under Obama, but the rate of growth remained sluggish. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had expected the US to create about 125,000 new jobs in October, following a gain of 114,000 in September \u2013 so Friday's numbers were better than expected. August and September's numbers were revised up.</p> <p>Last month's figures helped drive the US unemployment rate below the politically important rate of 8% for the first time since Obama took office in January 2009. The unemployment rate rose slightly from 7.8% to 7.9%.</p> <p>The political spinning began immediately. Mitt Romney said: \"Today's increase in the unemployment rate is a sad reminder that the economy is at a virtual standstill.\"</p> <p>\"The jobless rate is higher than it was when president Obama took office, and there are still 23m Americans struggling for work. On Tuesday, America will make a choice between stagnation and prosperity.\"</p> <p>Obama, speaking at a rally in Hilliard, Ohio, brushed over the job figures, slipping in just a sentence to his normal stump speech.</p> <p>\"Today our businesses have created nearly 5.5 million new jobs. And this morning we learned that companies hired more workers in October than at any time in the last eight months. The American auto industry is back on top. Home values and housing construction is on the rise. We are less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last 20 years.</p> <p>\"We have made real progress but we are here today because we know we have got more work to do. As long as there is a single American who wants a job and can't find one, as long as there are families working harder but falling behind, as long as there is a child anywhere in this country languishing in poverty and barred from opportunity, our fight goes on. We have got more work to do.\"</p> <p>The Romney campaign has attached great importance to the monthly jobs figures.

      "bodyText": "The US added 171,000 new jobs in October, far higher than expected and handing president Barack Obama's campaign a major boost four days before the election. It was the 25th consecutive month of jobs growth under Obama, but the rate of growth remained sluggish. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had expected the US to create about 125,000 new jobs in October, following a gain of 114,000 in September \u2013 so Friday's numbers were better than expected. August and September's numbers were revised up. Last month's figures helped drive the US unemployment rate below the politically important rate of 8% for the first time since Obama took office in January 2009. The unemployment rate rose slightly from 7.8% to 7.9%. The political spinning began immediately. Mitt Romney said: \"Today's increase in the unemployment rate is a sad reminder that the economy is at a virtual standstill.\" \"The jobless rate is higher than it was when president Obama took office, and there are still 23m Americans struggling for work. On Tuesday, America will make a choice between stagnation and prosperity.\" Obama, speaking at a rally in Hilliard, Ohio, brushed over the job figures, slipping in just a sentence to his normal stump speech. \"Today our businesses have created nearly 5.5 million new jobs. And this morning we learned that companies hired more workers in October than at any time in the last eight months. The American auto industry is back on top. Home values and housing construction is on the rise. We are less dependent on foreign oil than any time in the last 20 years. \"We have made real progress but we are here today because we know we have got more work to do. As long as there is a single American who wants a job and can't find one, as long as there are families working harder but falling behind, as long as there is a child anywhere in this country languishing in poverty and barred from opportunity, our fight goes on. We have got more work to do.\" The Romney campaign has attached great importance to the monthly jobs figures. During the Republican national convention in Tampa, Florida, two months ago, one of Romney's senior strategist set out the basics of their campaign, some of which turned out as planned, such as a strong debate performance.

      "bodyText": "Never one to give up a good fight, especially with his reputation hanging in the balance, Nat Rothschild is forming a rival consortium to launch a counter-offer for mining firm Bumi against bitter rivals the Bakrie family. The Indonesian mining saga at Bumi, which was brought to the London Stock Exchange by Rothschild with the backing of one of Jakarta's most powerful families \u2013 including presidential candidate Aburizal Bakrie, has seen the two dynasties fall out spectacularly. According to Reuters, Rothschild has teamed up with another presidential candidate, Prabowo Subianto, to thwart the Bakrie's $1.4bn plans to buy out Bumi. The Bakries had planned to quit Bumi and dismantle the company by buying back the stakes the plc has in its two main coal mine assets \u2013 Bumi Resources and Berau Coal Energy. News of a counter offer by Rothschild sent share up 10.7%, 26.5p, to 273.8p, in early trading, however they are still a long way off the \u00a310 a pop floatation price. The buyout plan by the Bakries involves swapping their Bumi Plc shares for part of the 29% of Bumi Resources held by the London-listed company, then buying the rest of the stake for cash, before buying Bumi Plc's 85% stake in Berau. Buying out the 29% stake is seen as fairly straight forward, but prising the 85% stake away from London for Berau \u2013 Indonesia's fourth largest coal mine - could prove more difficult. Rothschild quit the board as a non-executive director after the Bakries made their offer to buy out the company, saying it would not be in the interests of shareholders to accept the deal. He said at the time: \"it will be a disgrace to proceed with, or even to entertain the proposal\". Previously, he had been forced out as co-chairman after writing to the Bakries demanding a clean up of the company's operations. The resignation came just weeks after the London-listed company launched an investigation into financial irregularities at Bumi Resources in Indonesia, after a whistleblower in Jakarta sent document relating, in part, to a \u00a3198m writedown the company made last year to a business owned by a member of the board. Since standing down, the mudslinging between Rothschild, the Bakries, and Bumi chief executive Samin Tan \u2013 a Bakrie ally \u2013 has continued. Emails reveal that Rothschild was told if he did not step down, Tan and senior non-executive director, Sir Julian Horn-Smith, would leave. Tan claimed Rothschild had been persistently disrupted, hinted he could send the businessman to jail and even suggested the banking scion had been hacking Tan's emails. Rothschild denies all the allegations, calling them untrue and defamatory. Expect this drama to continue.",
