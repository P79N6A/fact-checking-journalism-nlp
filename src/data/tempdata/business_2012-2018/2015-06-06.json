      "bodyText": "The rows of glasses glint on impeccably laid tables, inviting guests to pair wines with chocolate or Turkish delight beneath the cloud-capped Hottentots Holland mountains. Established by the governor of the Cape in the 18th century, the sumptuous Lourensford Wine Estate spans 4,000 hectares and contains vineyards, apple, plum and pear trees and beehives, as well as an art gallery, coffee roastery and landscaped garden. That the farm in South Africa\u2019s celebrated wine country is owned by Christo Wiese, said to be the country\u2019s fourth-richest man, will come as little surprise to those who have felt his spending power of late. The 73-year-old Afrikaner is moving into Britain in a big way. He has just snapped up two household names in short order: Sir Richard Branson\u2019s gym chain Virgin Active for \u00a3682m and high-street fashion retailer New Look for \u00a3780m. He is also backing a new UK fashion chain, Pep &amp; Co, specialising in discount fashion and childrenswear for young mums. The first shop is due to open next month, in Kettering, Northants, and there should be 50 outlets open for business by the end of August. It is a bold plan in a tough market, going up against rivals such as Primark, Matalan and the supermarket fashion labels, and Wiese has hired former Asda boss Andy Bond \u2013 who previously ran the grocer\u2019s George clothing label \u2013 to mastermind the plan. The idea is to cash in on the booming demand for discount stores and provide a fashion shop for those who are regular customers at chains such Wilko, Poundland, Aldi and Iceland. The chain will focus on high-street outlets in smaller towns. \u201cWhat the discounters have done in food, I hope we can do in fashion,\u201d explains Bond. Wiese certainly has the experience. His Pepkor group owns 3,700 clothes stores worldwide, including nearly 3,000 in southern Africa, a 500-store chain in Poland called Pepco, and growing businesses in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, Australia and New Zealand. Like many of the most successful retail entrepreneurs, Wiese also has deep pockets: Forbes puts his fortune at $6.5bn (\u00a34.2bn). But this billionaire is not one for ostentatious displays of wealth: he still drives his own car and works from a third-floor office that has none of the glamour of the Lourensford Estate, or the stupendous ocean views enjoyed by many of Cape Town\u2019s cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. Instead he remains where it all began, on an industrial estate where his parents founded the clothing chain Pep Stores, among carwashes and tuck shops in Parow East. \u201cIt\u2019s the most unfashionable suburb you can imagine,\u201d says Marc Hasenfuss, editor-at-large of South Africa\u2019s Financial Mail. \u201cHe certainly hasn\u2019t got a view of the sea or the mountain. It\u2019s drab and there are certainly no trappings of grandeur there, that\u2019s for sure. He says this is where his constituency is: the people who are shopping at his stores.\u201d Wiese grew up in Upington in Northern Cape, the biggest but least populated province in the country, and his father was a smalltown businessman and farmer. \u201cMy dad drove a nice car, we had a nice home, we went on nice holidays,\u201d he told South Africa\u2019s Sunday Times newspaper in 2011. He trained and worked as a lawyer, but in the 1960s joined the family business as an executive director at Pep Stores, which would grow to become Pepkor. He had brief forays into the diamond mining industry and politics, standing as a candidate for the Progressive Federal party \u2013 a forerunner of today\u2019s opposition Democratic Alliance \u2013 in Simon\u2019s Town in 1977. He came second. He returned to Pepkor as chairman in 1980 and took the company public six years later. By then it had bought grocer Shoprite Holdings, which was later spun off and is now Africa\u2019s biggest food retailer. Wiese had equity in both companies and now owns immensely lucrative stakes in Shoprite and Steinhoff, the South African firm that is the second biggest furniture seller in Europe with brands including Harveys, Bensons for Beds and Cargo. He also owns a stake in Iceland. But his first attempt to crack Britain \u2013 with Poundstretcher and Your More Store \u2013 was not a roaring success. Hasenfuss says: \u201cHe\u2019s certainly not dull. Even when he cocks it up, he\u2019s interesting. He\u2019s a hell of a brave investor.\u201d The recent audacious acquisitions of Virgin Active and New Look suggest that Wiese has lost none of his appetite. Hasenfuss adds: \u201cI believe the guy\u2019s addicted to it. He loves the risk. His eyes light up. Like other people with golf or surfing or whatever, he loves being in the game.\u201d Yet he appears to have made surprisingly few enemies. \u201cWhen I did a cover story on him I was looking for that quote, \u2018Christo\u2019s a bastard\u2019, and really struggled to find anyone to say a bad word about him. He\u2019s an incredibly polite, decent person. He doesn\u2019t hold grudges. I\u2019ve been around for a long time and I\u2019ve never heard, \u2018Jeez, Christo screwed me\u2019. I suppose he\u2019s rich enough that he doesn\u2019t need to.\u201d Wiese bought the Lourensford Wine Estate in 1998, vowing to preserve and protect its heritage, and attends financial meetings there monthly. In 2006 he hired Koos Jordaan to run the wine division. Wiese is not a wine aficionado but is partial to the estate\u2019s chardonnay and M\u00e9thode Cap Classique, according to Jordaan. Sometimes he also come to the property to enjoy clay pigeon shooting. \u201cChristo is very charismatic and easygoing,\u201d Jordaan says. \u201cAlways a smile, always a joke. He\u2019s the kind of guy who would walk in here and say to the staff, how are you doing? He\u2019s down-to-earth, not on a pedestal. He doesn\u2019t have a chauffeur, even though he could afford 10. He\u2019ll always tell stories about the olden times \u2013 in every meeting there\u2019s always a lesson.\u201d Jordaan adds: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned from Christo is that once he\u2019s made a move, he\u2019s like a very good chess player: there are a few steps after that and a very long-term goal. That\u2019s why he\u2019s been successful. He\u2019s been able to identify these opportunities and make the right moves.\u201d South Africa is one of the most unequal societies in the world, polarised between a super-rich, still largely white, elite that includes Wiese, and a black majority plagued by rampant unemployment. \u201cChristo feels business in South Africa has a common responsibility of really uplifting South Africa and Africa, either by offering job opportunities or in other ways,\u201d Jordaan says. \u201cHe\u2019s still very optimistic about the future of South Africa and Africa. He says the resources still need to be developed. That\u2019s why he\u2019s still here.\u201d He is married to Caro, the daughter of the late Japie Basson, the leading politician dubbed a chameleon because of his habit of changing parties, and has three children, all in their 30s. Wiese himself keeps a low political profile. He watches rugby and cricket and spends time helping conservation efforts on his game farm in the Kalahari desert. \u201cI still enjoy what I\u2019m doing, which is building businesses,\u201d he said recently. \u201cI don\u2019t play golf. I don\u2019t have any particular passion apart from my business and my family, and that gives me all the pleasure that I want.\u201d Retirement, evidently, is unthinkable. Syd Vianello, a retail analyst, says: \u201cIn his world it\u2019s about achieving the next business deal and that\u2019s what gives him a kick. It\u2019s a bit strange to go into the UK at this time of life, but it\u2019s in his DNA.\u201d Britain has not always been a happy hunting ground for Wiese. In a strange incident in 2009, he was stopped with almost \u00a3700,000 in cash in a suitcase while boarding a plane at London City airport. But he has since had the money returned to him in full after his lawyers were able to demonstrate that the sum was a drop in the ocean of his personal fortune. The amounts changing hands for Virgin Active and New Look appear to illustrate the point.",

      "bodyText": "Christo Wiese has made a splash with his buyout of New Look, but the South African retail tycoon has tried to muscle in on the UK\u2019s high streets before \u2013 with Poundstretcher discount stores \u2013 and failed. Founded in 1981, Poundstretcher was one of the UK\u2019s first discounters. Today it has 407 stores, but a number of early strategy mis-steps constrained its growth compared with the likes of B&amp;M, Poundland or Poundworld. Managing director Ian York, who is working with current owners Rashid and Aziz Tayub to revive the chain\u2019s fortunes, says that when they took over the business \u201cwas in the dark\u201d. The Tayubs bought into Poundstretcher in 2007, when they took a stake in Brown &amp; Jackson, a quoted company which owned the discount brand and was controlled by Wiese\u2019s Pepkor. Two years later Wiese sold his stake to the brothers. Since then they have invested more than \u00a350m to revamp its stores and revitalise its product ranges in a bid to compete with its bigger rivals in the fast-growing discount sector that has been causing so many problems for the big supermarkets. York says getting the right mix is key. Discounters have caught the attention of British shoppers because they have transformed themselves since the 1990s, when Wiese last tried his luck in the UK. \u201cIn those days, discounters were like bazaars or jumble sales inside a shop. The change in retailing in the last two or three years has been ginormous. The recession helped to drive footfall into massive discounters like B&amp;M and Home Bargains. It has made it acceptable for all demographic groups. But when we come out of recession, all those people aren\u2019t going to say \u2018let\u2019s go to Waitrose\u2019. It\u2019s now acceptable to want to save money.\u201d Under the Tayubs, Poundstretcher has dipped in and out of losses but it made \u00a31.3m profit in the year to March 2014. In the year just finished, York says it will \u201csignificantly increase\u201d profits after sales rose 12% to \u00a3510m. This year it aims for \u00a3560m of sales. \u201cWe have an owner who is passionate about the business and hungry to make it grow,\u201d he says. Their aim is to reach 500 stores within 18 months, though there is hot competition for new sites as all Poundstretcher\u2019s rivals are on the expansion trail. The group is closing almost as many outlets as it is opening as York moves towards larger stores. He wants 12,000-15,000 sq ft sites in which shoppers can be tempted in with 240 PG Tips tea bags for \u00a33.49 or four Twix for \u00a31, then sold a \u00a359.99 double bed or some garden furniture, or a sparkly rug. He has brought in more food and toiletries and developed Pet Hut, a cut-price pet supplies centre, in about 100 stores as he tries to pull in more regular shoppers. But food and toiletries are the fastest-growing part of the business, now making up half of the chain\u2019s sales and taking up about 12% of its store space, compared with less than 5% a year ago. York says that is helping grab market share from the supermarkets. The team have to be fast-moving. Striding the floor of Poundstretcher\u2019s Pontefract store, York points out how it has prepared for what looked set to be a warm and sunny weekend: \u201cWe\u2019ve got gardening stuff outside, fans near the door, paddling pools in the first aisle. We are reactive to what customers want.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Christo Wiese has made a splash with his buyout of New Look, but the South African retail tycoon has tried to muscle in on the UK\u2019s high streets before \u2013 with Poundstretcher discount stores \u2013 and failed.</p> <p>Founded in 1981, Poundstretcher was one of the UK\u2019s first discounters. Today it has 407 stores, but a number of early strategy mis-steps constrained its growth compared with the likes of B&amp;M, Poundland or Poundworld. Managing director Ian York, who is working with current owners Rashid and Aziz Tayub to revive the chain\u2019s fortunes, says that when they took over the business \u201cwas in the dark\u201d.</p> <p>The Tayubs bought into Poundstretcher in 2007, when they took a stake in Brown &amp; Jackson, a quoted company which owned the discount brand and was controlled by Wiese\u2019s Pepkor. Two years later Wiese sold his stake to the brothers.</p> <p>Since then they have invested more than \u00a350m to revamp its stores and revitalise its product ranges in a bid to compete with its bigger rivals in the fast-growing discount sector that has been causing so many problems for the big supermarkets.</p> <p>York says getting the right mix is key. Discounters have caught the attention of British shoppers because they have transformed themselves since the 1990s, when Wiese last tried his luck in the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/06/christo-wiese-south-africa-fashion-billionaire-comes-to-britain\">Christo Wiese: South Africa\u2019s modest fashion billionaire comes to Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn those days, discounters were like bazaars or jumble sales inside a shop. The change in retailing in the last two or three years has been ginormous. The recession helped to drive footfall into massive discounters like B&amp;M and Home Bargains. It has made it acceptable for all demographic groups. But when we come out of recession, all those people aren\u2019t going to say \u2018let\u2019s go to Waitrose\u2019. It\u2019s now acceptable to want to save money.\u201d</p> <p>Under the Tayubs, Poundstretcher has dipped in and out of losses but it made \u00a31.3m profit in the year to March 2014. In the year just finished, York says it will \u201csignificantly increase\u201d profits after sales rose 12% to \u00a3510m. This year it aims for \u00a3560m of sales.</p> <p>\u201cWe have an owner who is passionate about the business and hungry to make it grow,\u201d he says. Their aim is to reach 500 stores within 18 months, though there is hot competition for new sites as all Poundstretcher\u2019s rivals are on the expansion trail.</p> <p>The group is closing almost as many outlets as it is opening as York moves towards larger stores. He wants 12,000-15,000 sq ft sites in which shoppers can be tempted in with 240 PG Tips tea bags for \u00a33.49 or four Twix for \u00a31, then sold a \u00a359.99 double bed or some garden furniture, or a sparkly rug. He has brought in more food and toiletries and developed Pet Hut, a cut-price pet supplies centre, in about 100 stores as he tries to pull in more regular shoppers.</p> <p>But food and toiletries are the fastest-growing part of the business, now making up half of the chain\u2019s sales and taking up about 12% of its store space, compared with less than 5% a year ago. York says that is helping grab market share from the supermarkets.</p> <p>The team have to be fast-moving. Striding the floor of Poundstretcher\u2019s Pontefract store, York points out how it has prepared for what looked set to be a warm and sunny weekend: \u201cWe\u2019ve got gardening stuff outside, fans near the door, paddling pools in the first aisle. We are reactive to what customers want.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "An elite crop of black-tie wearing bankers will head to Mansion House, the grand official residence of the Lord Mayor of London, on Wednesday night, to hear George Osborne and Mark Carney deliver their annual address to the City at what is officially the \u201cBankers and Merchants Dinner\u201d. The speeches by the chancellor and the Bank of England governor at the annual Mansion House dinner, as it is better known, almost always make their audience of 400 or so City workers sit up and take note. Osborne used his first Mansion House speech, in 2010, to confirm his plan to disband the Financial Services Authority and name the five members of his independent commission on banking, which was chaired by Sir John Vickers. This was also the moment he first mentioned the bank levy, now the source of so much controversy. The sale of bailed-out Northern Rock and the government\u2019s stake in Lloyds Banking Group were both announced in Mansion House speeches \u2013 in 2011 and 2013 respectively \u2013 while last year he unveiled plans to let the Bank of England cap risky mortgage loans and announced the launch of a \u201cfair and effective markets review\u201d, to look at the new sanctions needed to clean up finance. This year, Carney is expected to announce the outcome of that review into City practices, and Osborne could unveil the next phase in his bid to sell the government\u2019s remaining stakes in the banks. Among the issues expected to be on agenda on Wednesday are: Stakes in Lloyds and RBS Last week, Osborne set out his plans to further reduce the government stake in Lloyds from 19% \u2013 it was 43% in 2008 \u2013 by drip-feeding shares into the public market. He is preparing an offering to retail investors (an idea he also mooted in a Mansion House address two years ago). He has been less clear about RBS since returning to No 11, apart from signalling in the runup to the election that it would be his priority to sell off the shares if he was returned to his old job. At the very least, Osborne could launch a review of the options for returning RBS to the private sector, including what price the Treasury would be willing to accept. The average price at which the 79% stake in the bank was bought in 2008 and 2009 was 502p, although the shares are valued in the country\u2019s books at 407p (the average price at which the shares were trading on the day the taxpayer stepped in). The shares ended the week well below that price, at 357p: hence the dilemma the chancellor faces. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, says: \u201cMany argue that Osborne should \u2018launch\u2019 a disposal of the UK government\u2019s 79% stake at the Mansion House next week; but why sell now, at approximately 350p, when he didn\u2019t at 404p in February 2015?\u201d Regulatory reform The day before Osborne gets on his feet, Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of HSBC, is expected to set out the criteria the bank will use to decide whether to remain headquartered in London or move back to Hong Kong. The rules surrounding ringfencing \u2013 recommended by the Vickers commission, and requiring the separation of high street and investment banking operations \u2013 have already been cited by Gulliver as a potential factor on his list. The bank levy \u2013 which cost HSBC \u00a3700m last year, more than any other bank \u2013 is another of Gulliver\u2019s gripes. The Conservative manifesto set out a commitment to keeping the bank levy and pressing ahead with ringfencing. Even so, bankers will be watching to see whether Osborne launches a review into the levy, which he has increased nine times since 2010, or shows any sign of relaxing the rules on ringfencing. The British Bankers\u2019 Association wrote to the Treasury last week calling for a formal review of the way the banking sector is taxed. Tougher punishment for bankers The fair and efficient markets review announced in last year\u2019s Mansion House speech is expected to completed by the time Osborne and Carney speak on Wednesday. Bankers expect a tougher set of rules to clamp down on market manipulation in the light of record fines imposed recently for rigging foreign exchange markets, and more emphasis on individual responsibility.",
