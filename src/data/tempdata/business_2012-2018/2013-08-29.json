August 2011 The Co-operative Group announces bid for 632 Lloyds branches. December 2011 Lloyds board approves the Co-op bid. Regulator warns Lloyds that Co-op lacks the necessary reserves to underwrite the deal. July 2012 The deal to purchase the branches wins \"heads of terms\" agreement. Chancellor George Osborne praises the deal, saying it creates \"a new challenger bank\". March 2013 Co-op bank blames Britannia for \u00a3257m loss in 2012. Life insurance, asset management and general insurance businesses are lined up for sale. April 2013 Co-op withdraws offer for branches, citing a \"worsened outlook\" in the economy and \"increasing regulatory requirements\". May 2013 Moody's downgrades the bank's credit rating and Tootell resigns. Former HSBC executive Niall Booker is named as his replacement. Euan Sutherland becomes chief executive of the wider Co-operative Group. Former Alliance &amp; Leicester boss Richard Pym becomes chairman of the bank. 17 June 2013 Group announces a shortfall in reserves of \u00a31.5bn following talks with new regulator the Prudential Regulatory Authority. The Bank says it will offer up to 49% of shares in the bank to bondholders in exchange for \u00a3500m debt write-off. 29 August 2013 Bank reveals largest loss in its history. Co-op members begin campaign to prevent flotation at www.facebook.com/SaveTheCoop.",

Advances in communications technology mean that the prime minister could watch a video of Eton Rifles on MTV and the Bank of England governor could listen to his favourite Bugg tracks on his iPod on the way back from giving a speech in Nottingham. But have globalisation and the IT revolution made music more homogenous, increasing the dominance of American music at the expense of domestic artists? The answer, according to research in the Economic Journal, is no. Somewhat surprisingly, the study by Fernando Ferreira and Joel Waldfogel found that there was a substantial bias among consumers towards music from their own country, and this bias has actually increased since the turn of the millennium. Contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence that iPods or Spotify, the internet or MTV, have made it more likely that everybody will be singing the same global tunes. The study looked at 22 countries in the half century from 1960. It concluded that a country's market share in music was roughly the same as its market share in global output. Consumers tend to prefer home-grown music to imported stuff. Imported music tends to come from countries that are geographically close and share a language. Despite technological advances, the effects of distance and language have remained constant over the past 50 years. Finally, home bias might have increased as a result of the internet and satellite TV channels.

It says India's economic slowdown is likely to \"deeper and longer than our baseline expectations\", further adding to pressures in its banking sector.</p> <p>More from <strong>Fitch</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The 21% depreciation of the rupee since 1 April is likely to pressurize the financial performance of the Indian corporations with unhedged foreign-currency borrowing. As a result, Indian banks' asset quality could remain under prolonged pressure. Moreover, the sharp weakening of the rupee, if not swiftly reversed, will delay any chances of recovery in domestic demand.</p> <p>Recent monetary measures to support the currency have raised the likelihood of a further slowdown within the fiscal year ending March 2014 (FY14). These policy measures, which have sharply raised short-term rates, follow a sub-5% year-on-year GDP growth rate over the past few quarters. These developments belie our earlier expectation of a modest pick-up in India's economic growth. They will also subdue any improvement in the growth rate of loan books.</p> <p>One likely result is that banks' earnings profiles will encounter more pressure than previously anticipated. This is because of weaker margins resulting from higher funding costs, and a lower ability to pass on costs to the customer due to soft demand and slowing loan growth.</p> <p>No bank is likely to be unscathed by recent events. But public sector banks remain under relatively greater pressure. This is because their (standalone) stress-absorption capacity is comparatively lower than their private-sector peers, adding further downward pressure on their Viability Ratings. However, as most public-sector banks' IDRs factor in support from the sovereign, the outlook at that level remains stable - in line with that of the sovereign.</p> <p>Overall, heightened credit pressures would add to concerns about capital adequacy for certain parts of the system. That said, recent statements by the authorities which recognize the need to maintain the capital positions of public sector banks should prove supportive.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-08-29T12:34:22.010Z\">at 1.34pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-521f1f3ce4b06e09d5c58069\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-29T11:06:24.480Z\">12.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The ECB introduces targets to double number of senior women</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2013/html/pr130829.en.html\">European Central Bank</a> has introduced gender targets to double the share of women in management.</p> <p>By the end of <strong>2019</strong> the central bank wants to see 35% of middle management positions held by women, compared with 17% now.

      "bodyText": "After two days of decline, stock markets have mounted something of a recovery. Investor sentiment has been helped by merger hopes in the telecoms market after Vodafone said it was in talks to sell its stake in joint venture Verizon Wireless for perhaps $130bn, as well as easing concerns about an imminent military strike on Syria. Better than expected US GDP figures have also been seen as a positive, despite the possible negative implications for the Federal Reserve's bond buying programme. So here are the scores on the doors: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 52.99 points higher at 6483.05 or 0.82% \u2022 Germany's Dax rose 0.4% to 8190.65 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.68% higher at3987.36 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 0.97% ahead at 16,905.15 \u2022 Spain's Ibex added 0.4% to 8432.1 \u2022 The Athens market climbed 1.45% to 893.77 Meanwhile in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 0.5% or 80 points higher. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments and we'll be back tomorrow. Still with the IMF, a spokesman has said the fund has not held talks with Greece about a third bailout. Gerry Rice told reporters (courtesy Reuters): In our next review we'll discuss developments on that front [Greece's funding needs] and see where we are. The numbers of course could change in either direction. He repeated that Europe had promised to support Greece until it can return to the markets in its own right, provided it sticks to its current obligations. The next review by the IMF is due in the second half of September. As the debate over whether Greece does or does not need a new bailout continues, one part of the troika has appointed a new representative to the country. Wes McGrew will next week become the IMF resident representative in Greece, replacing Bob Traa after his three year term ends. According to the IMF McGrew has previously worked on a number of countries including Ecuador, Turkey, Macedonia, and Cyprus: Most recently, he was a senior member of the IMF team working on Greece. Before joining the IMF, Mr. McGrew held positions at the NASDAQ stock market and at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. He holds a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago. US markets have opened slightly lower: Dow Jones: -0.2% at 14,795 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 1,631 European markets are mixed: FTSE 100: +0.5% at 6,465 CAC 40: -0.1% at 3,956 DAX 30: -0.2% at 8,142 IBEX: -0.1% at 8,403 FTSE MIB: +0.5% at 16,829 And with that, I'll hand over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Sticking with the US, the latest weekly figures from the Labor Department show that new jobless claims fell to 331,000 last week, from 337,000 a week earlier. The four-week moving average was 331,250, an increase of 750 from the previous week's average of 330,500. US second-quarter growth was revised up to 2.5% on an annual basis from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. Economists had forecast a rise to 2.2%. The upward revision was thanks to a jump in exports and will further fuel speculation that the US Federal Reserve will start to wind down its stimulus programme sooner rather than later. It was more than double the 1.1% rate of annual growth achieved in the first quarter of the year. ING's Rob Carnell says: These figures will help to put the September taper question back into the limelight, and certainly encourage thoughts that a taper will be announced at the next FOMC meeting. However, we will have to wait for next Friday\u2019s labour market report to be able to say with more confidence that this is in the bag \u2013 and much can happen in the meantime to scupper these thoughts, including of course a military strike on Syria, and likely slump in investor confidence in the aftermath, and of course, renewed spat over the budget ceiling and government spending. The GDP figures also contain some interesting data on corporate profits, which whilst looking reasonable at a headline level, reveal a worsening in corporate cash-flow, largely, it seems, due to a faster pace of dividend payout. Whilst this helps boost consumer non-employment incomes, and spending power, it doesn\u2019t do much for the prospects of corporate investment growth over the coming quarters, and can help to explain why this has been relatively moribund so far this year. Fitch Ratings has published a note saying the sharp depreciation of the Indian rupee will pile the pressure on the country's banks. It says India's economic slowdown is likely to \"deeper and longer than our baseline expectations\", further adding to pressures in its banking sector. More from Fitch: The 21% depreciation of the rupee since 1 April is likely to pressurize the financial performance of the Indian corporations with unhedged foreign-currency borrowing. As a result, Indian banks' asset quality could remain under prolonged pressure. Moreover, the sharp weakening of the rupee, if not swiftly reversed, will delay any chances of recovery in domestic demand. Recent monetary measures to support the currency have raised the likelihood of a further slowdown within the fiscal year ending March 2014 (FY14). These policy measures, which have sharply raised short-term rates, follow a sub-5% year-on-year GDP growth rate over the past few quarters. These developments belie our earlier expectation of a modest pick-up in India's economic growth. They will also subdue any improvement in the growth rate of loan books. One likely result is that banks' earnings profiles will encounter more pressure than previously anticipated. This is because of weaker margins resulting from higher funding costs, and a lower ability to pass on costs to the customer due to soft demand and slowing loan growth. No bank is likely to be unscathed by recent events. But public sector banks remain under relatively greater pressure. This is because their (standalone) stress-absorption capacity is comparatively lower than their private-sector peers, adding further downward pressure on their Viability Ratings. However, as most public-sector banks' IDRs factor in support from the sovereign, the outlook at that level remains stable - in line with that of the sovereign. Overall, heightened credit pressures would add to concerns about capital adequacy for certain parts of the system. That said, recent statements by the authorities which recognize the need to maintain the capital positions of public sector banks should prove supportive. The European Central Bank has introduced gender targets to double the share of women in management. By the end of 2019 the central bank wants to see 35% of middle management positions held by women, compared with 17% now. It wants to see the proportion of senior management roles held by women rise to 28% from 14%. \"In order to reach the gender targets, the ECB is implementing a gender diversity action plan,\" it said on Thursday. The Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras has told the Guardian it is \"far too premature\" to discuss a third aid package for Greece, and that \"absolutely nothing\" is certain yet. It follows mounting speculation that the debt-stricken country will require a third bailout in 2014. Stournaras said there was a possibility Greece would be able to regain access to international capital funding, having been left out in the cold since 2010. Helena Smith, the Guardian's correspondent in Greece, Turkey and Cyprus, reports: If the eurozone is as strong as its weakest link, then it may be stronger than many think. Speaking exclusively to the Guardian, the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras doused speculation that the debt-stricken country was in dire need of a third bailout \u2013 a prospect raised by the German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble last week. \u201cIt\u2019s very early now to talk about a [third] economic support package. For the next full year we have no additional need for money,\u201d said Stournaras referring to the country\u2019s current EU-IMF sponsored rescue programme. \u201cAll this speculation is premature. The EU [troika] money ends next July and that\u2019s when we\u2019ll have to judge the situation again. Nothing, absolutely nothing is certain yet.\u201d Athens\u2019 aim, he insisted, was to \u201capproach\u201d international capital markets \u2013 from which it has been excluded since 2010 \u2013 which would preclude the need for further aid to plug a funding gap in 2014 and 2015 variously estimated at between \u20ac9.5bn (\u00a38.1bn) and \u20ac11.1bn. \u201cThere is a possibility that next year we will have entered the market again provided we fulfill two conditions, securing a primary surplus [before interest payments on debt] and a positive growth rate [after six years of economic contraction],\u201d he added. Read the full story here. Earlier on Thursday Olli Rehn, the European Commission's economic chief, said Greece's international lenders would step up its assessment of the country's finances next month. The troika of lenders (the EU, European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund) first need to establish the facts and \"then conclude what kind of additional financing needs there are.\" Speaking at a conference in Austria he said the troika would \"intensify our work from September onwards\" and make firm proposals after that. The pound has strengthened against the euro following recent three-week lows, helped by rising bond yields after Mark Carney apparently failed to convince markets that interest rates will not be rasied from 0.5% until 2016. The euro was down 0.5% against the pound at 85.49p, as the value of UK sovereign debt fell with the yield on benchmark 10-year bonds hitting a new two-year high of 2.827% - the opposite direction to the move Carney might have hoped for. It followed his first speech as Bank of England governor on Wednesday. Analysts had expected Carney to try and more firmly talk down money markets, which are factoring in an interest rate hike in 2015, despite the Bank's forward guidance which suggests there will be no rise until 2016. Indonesia's central bank has raised benchmark interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 7% in a bid to shore up its weakened currency. The Indonesian rupiah has fallen by 8.9% against the dollar since the beginning of month, making it the second worst emerging market performer after the Indian rupee. Gareth Leather, Asian economist at Capital Economics, says further agressive rate hikes in Indonesia are unlikely: Today\u2019s 50 basis point rate hike, which takes the main policy rate to 7.0%, is the latest in a series of measures the authorities have taken to reduce the current account deficit and shore up the rupiah. The main policy rate has been increased by a cumulative 125 basis points in the past few months. On Friday the government unveiled plans to promote more foreign direct investment and reduce imports. The outlook for monetary policy depends largely on what happens to the currency. We believe that the current bout of currency volatility will prove short-lived and that a prolonged reversal of capital flows is unlikely. In such circumstances, further aggressive rate hikes in Indonesia are unlikely. Not everyone shares that view however: The number of people out of work in Germany rose by 7,000 to 2.943m in August, but it was not enough to push up the jobless rate, which remained stable at 6.8% according to the labour Office. Economists had expected the number of unemployed people to fall by 5,000. The Spanish economy shrank by 0.1% in the second quarter according to a final official estimate, in line with previous estimates and expections. First-quarter GDP was revised up however to show a 0.4% contraction compared with an earlier estimate of a 0.5% fall. The National Statistics Institute revised its data back to the beginning of 2009 and showed Spain's economy started shrinking in the second quarter of 2011, and not the third quarter of the same year as previously thought. Separate data showed that the country's annual inflation rate slowed to 1.6% in August, from 1.9% in July, which was just above economists' forecasts of a fall to 1.5%. Spain's IBEX which was lagging other European markets at open is now up slightly by 0.1% at 8,410. Europe's major markets have mostly opened higher following the gains in the US and Asia. In the UK, news that Vodafone is in talks with Verizon Communications to sell its 45% stake in their US joint venture pushed the mobile giant to the top of the FTSE 100 leader board, with shares up 8.4% at a 12-year high. Read the full story on Vodafone from the Guardian's telecoms correspondent Juliette Garside here. FTSE 100: +0.4% at 6,455 CAC 40: +0.4% at 3,976 DAX 30: +0.4% at 8,191 FTSE MIB: +0.3% at 16,798 Spain's IBEX is the exception, down 0.3% at 8,374. In the corporate world, a shocking turn of events is unfolding at Zurich Insurance Group. Josef Ackermann, the group's chairman and former Deutsche Bank boss, is linking his resignation this morning to the apparent suicide of the insurer's financial chief earlier this week. Ackermann said in a statement: The unexpected death of Pierre Wauthier has deeply shocked me. I have reasons to believe that the family is of the opinion that I should take my share of responsibility, as unfounded as any allegations might be. As a consequence, I see the possibility of a continued successful Board leadership to the benefit of Zurich called into question. To avoid any damage to Zurich\u2019s reputation, I have decided to resign from all my Board functions with immediate effect.

      "body": "<p>As the market regained some poise - mainly due to merger developments and easing fears about Syria - <strong>Pearson</strong> missed out on the rebound.</p> <p>The Penguin, Financial Times and educational publisher fell 36p to \u00a312.80 after analysts at Deutsche Bank cut their rating from hold to sell. They said:</p> <blockquote> Pearson faces more structural change than any other professional publisher. [A] warning in February partly acknowledged that, but the share price has ignored it. The fact that 60% or more of group revenues are print and digital content and that \"digital &amp; services\" itself faces many challenges is in our view ignored in the current high rating. A near-term upward hike in savings guidance is possible, but we don't see revenue upside risk. Profit warnings seldom come in ones. <br> </blockquote> <p>Overall, after two days of decline on concerns of a military attack on Syria, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> ended 52.99 points higher at 6483.05. Better than expected US GDP figures also helped sentiment, even though it brought the prospect of the US Federal Reserve cutting back its bond buying programme. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote> As politicians continue to discuss an appropriate plan of action over Syria, it looks increasingly less likely that military action will take place prior to a UN report. <br> Today's economic figures from the US will have proven to the Federal Reserve that the progress being made with the US economy is still continuing. The much better-than-expected preliminary quarterly GDP figures should help the cause of those FOMC members eager to introduce tapering. As yet the looming issue of the US once again hitting its debt ceiling is being ignored by equity markets, but it's likely to be increasingly focused on as we tick towards October. </blockquote> <p>Much of the FTSE 100 rise - nearly 30 points - was due to <strong>Vodafone</strong>. The mobile phone group rose 15.45p to 204.75p after it confirmed reports <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/29/vodafone-shares-surge-verizon-talks-back-on\" title=\"\">it had restarted talks over the disposal of its 45% stake in its US joint venture Verizon Wireless.</a> Some analysts believe the stake could be worth up to $130bn.</p> <p>Elsewhere there were positive results from advertising giant <strong>WPP</strong>, up 49p to \u00a312.27, and industrial group <strong>Melrose</strong>, 17.4p better at 301.8p.</p> <p>But outsourcing group <strong>Serco</strong> slumped 68p to 538.5p despite a positive set of half year, with investors paying more attention to Wednesday's late news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/28/police-serco-alleged-fraud\" title=\"\">justice secretary Chris Grayling had called in police to investigate alleged fraud by Serco staff working on a \u00a3285m prisoner escorting contract. </a>Serco said it had discovered misreporting on the contract but found no evidence management knew about the problem. It will repay \u00a32m of profit on the contract and forego any future benefits. Chief executive Chris Hyman said he was \"deeply saddened and appalled\" and would instititute a programme of change.</p> <p>Elsewhere transport group <strong>Stagecoach</strong> accelerated 20.4p to 327.8p after a positive trading update.</p> <p>The company said like for like revenue in its UK rail business rose 6.5% in the twelve weeks to 21 July, while its Virgin Rail joint venture with Richard Branson's conglomerate saw a 5.8% increase. Regional buses, which account for around 60% of group profits, saw revenues climb 4.5%, up from an estimated 2% increase in a weather hit fourth quarter. In its US business, which includes Megabus.com, revenues rose 5.7% in the three months to the end of July.</p> <p>It said trading continued to be good and its prospects remained positive.</p> <p><strong>Evraz</strong> - the Russian steelmaker controlled by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich -jumped 9.3p to 134p despite the company scrapping its dividend after a $122m first half loss.

      "bodyText": "As the market regained some poise - mainly due to merger developments and easing fears about Syria - Pearson missed out on the rebound. The Penguin, Financial Times and educational publisher fell 36p to \u00a312.80 after analysts at Deutsche Bank cut their rating from hold to sell. They said: Pearson faces more structural change than any other professional publisher. [A] warning in February partly acknowledged that, but the share price has ignored it. The fact that 60% or more of group revenues are print and digital content and that \"digital &amp; services\" itself faces many challenges is in our view ignored in the current high rating. A near-term upward hike in savings guidance is possible, but we don't see revenue upside risk. Profit warnings seldom come in ones. Overall, after two days of decline on concerns of a military attack on Syria, the FTSE 100 ended 52.99 points higher at 6483.05. Better than expected US GDP figures also helped sentiment, even though it brought the prospect of the US Federal Reserve cutting back its bond buying programme. Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, said: As politicians continue to discuss an appropriate plan of action over Syria, it looks increasingly less likely that military action will take place prior to a UN report. Today's economic figures from the US will have proven to the Federal Reserve that the progress being made with the US economy is still continuing. The much better-than-expected preliminary quarterly GDP figures should help the cause of those FOMC members eager to introduce tapering. As yet the looming issue of the US once again hitting its debt ceiling is being ignored by equity markets, but it's likely to be increasingly focused on as we tick towards October. Much of the FTSE 100 rise - nearly 30 points - was due to Vodafone. The mobile phone group rose 15.45p to 204.75p after it confirmed reports it had restarted talks over the disposal of its 45% stake in its US joint venture Verizon Wireless. Some analysts believe the stake could be worth up to $130bn. Elsewhere there were positive results from advertising giant WPP, up 49p to \u00a312.27, and industrial group Melrose, 17.4p better at 301.8p. But outsourcing group Serco slumped 68p to 538.5p despite a positive set of half year, with investors paying more attention to Wednesday's late news that justice secretary Chris Grayling had called in police to investigate alleged fraud by Serco staff working on a \u00a3285m prisoner escorting contract. Serco said it had discovered misreporting on the contract but found no evidence management knew about the problem. It will repay \u00a32m of profit on the contract and forego any future benefits. Chief executive Chris Hyman said he was \"deeply saddened and appalled\" and would instititute a programme of change. Elsewhere transport group Stagecoach accelerated 20.4p to 327.8p after a positive trading update. The company said like for like revenue in its UK rail business rose 6.5% in the twelve weeks to 21 July, while its Virgin Rail joint venture with Richard Branson's conglomerate saw a 5.8% increase. Regional buses, which account for around 60% of group profits, saw revenues climb 4.5%, up from an estimated 2% increase in a weather hit fourth quarter. In its US business, which includes Megabus.com, revenues rose 5.7% in the three months to the end of July. It said trading continued to be good and its prospects remained positive. Evraz - the Russian steelmaker controlled by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich -jumped 9.3p to 134p despite the company scrapping its dividend after a $122m first half loss. On a conference call chief executive Alexander Frotov said it may authorise a payout to shareholders following the sale of its South African and Czech assets. It hopes to sell these plants by the end of the year. But oil services group Hunting lost 36.5p to 831.5p after underlying half year profits fell 5.4% to \u00a361.2m, partly due to poor weather conditions in Canada leading to less drilling activity. But it hoped for a better performance in the second half, particularly in the US and Gulf of Mexico. Finally Ophir Energy added 4.3p to 324.3p on renewed takeover talk, with traders mentioning Exxon as a possible predator, and a positive note from JP Morgan Cazenove. The company's shares reacted negatively to a recent drilling update but the bank said: The sector is out of favor and investors are, more sharply than ever, focused on catalysts. With this as backdrop, drilling disappointment (direct: Ghana, indirect: pre-salt Gabon) and the loss of near term triggers has seen Ophir lose its valuation premium.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A thwarted attempt to become a major player in the banking industry earlier this year continued to haunt the Co-operative Group on Thursday as its bank reported a \u00a3709m loss and raised the prospect of a Northern Rock-style rescue if bondholders failed to back a \u00a31.5bn restructuring bid. The group, which has operations spanning funeral services to supermarkets, said there would be no quick fixes as directors conceded that shoring up the bank, which has 4.7 million customers, would involve job losses and significant restructuring of the wider group. Richard Pym, the bank chairman, said that without new capital the banking unit \"will not be a going concern\". The Co-op group's new chief executive, Euan Sutherland, said there was no plan B. The only alternative to meeting regulatory requirements to fill a \u00a31.5bn shortfall in the bank's reserves would be a government takeover similar to the bailout of Northern Rock in 2008. Sutherland reported that losses at the bank of \u00a3709m sent the wider group into a \u00a3559m loss, compared with \u00a318m of profits in the first half of 2012. He blamed \u00a3496m of previously undiscovered bad debts and a \u00a3150m write-off on IT systems for the deterioration in the bank's financial situation. \"It's inevitable in a restructuring of this size that there will be some jobs at risk,\" he said, predicting that the bank would be diminished from its current scale of 10,000 staff and 320 branches. Sutherland said a new management team would devise a turnaround strategy with the management consultancy Oliver Wyman. Sutherland indicated that executives would receive bonuses next year despite the group's travails, saying that a remuneration plan will be announced in March that will reflect the need to retain experienced senior staff. The Co-op's plunge into loss follows a difficult year that started with an audacious bid by its bank to buy 632 branches from Lloyds Banking Group and ended with the banking regulator insisting it abandon the deal and find \u00a31.5bn to cover previously undisclosed bad loans. The debacle stems from the Co-op bank's purchase of the Britannia building society in 2009, which had joined several other banks in making indiscriminate loans to corporate customers, many involved in overvalued commercial property deals. Sutherland said the Co-op bank's bad loans were mostly accounted for by Britannia, with half of all its poorly performing retail loans and three quarters of its roughly \u00a3440m corporate bad debts blamed on over-zealous loan agreements sold by the building society. The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), the City regulator, said on Thursday that the scale of the losses did not alter its demand that the Co-op plug the \u00a31.5bn hole in its balance sheet. A rescue of the bank has the support of the Co-op's board, which is made up of 20 non-executive directors, 15 of whom are elected from regional boards and five from Independent Co-operative Societies. Sutherland said the board had considered all the options and agreed to commit \u00a31bn of the Co-op group's funds to cover bad debts in return for a debt for equity swap by bondholders. Bondholders ranging from pensioners to hedge funds will have to take a loss on their investment under plans for a \"bail-in\" in coming months. They will be forced to contribute \u00a3500m through an \"exchange offer\", which will result in a stock market listing for the bank. Some 15,000 holders of Co-operative Bank bonds have written to the Bank of England's financial policy committee seeking an intervention in rescue of the bank. Mark Taber, representing retail bondholders who believe they should be spared a haircut on their investments, said there was a \"disgraceful\" lack of detail in the Co-op's offer. He said: \"The PRA should not allow this and should make a direction to the Co-op Bank [to alter the restructuring] accordingly.\" While the Co-op's board has agreed the deal, there is likely to be much debate inside Britain's largest mutual organisation about the cost of the rescue, the prospect of running a business with a large number of shares owned by non-mutual institutions and the potential for another banking crash to wreck the wider Co-operative Group. Sutherland, who replaced Peter Marks in May, said: \"We are sorry but we are a new team and grasping the nettle and getting on with fixing the situation.\" If a rescue fails Should the Co-op fail to secure a rescue of its banking division it will fall to the government to step in. There are several options for ministers and which one they choose will depend on the state of the Manchester-based bank. A Northern Rock-style takeover would be the most draconian. The government purchased all the Rock's shares and made it a wholly-owned state enterprise. A bailout of the bank would involve a large injection of cash to cover bad loans in return for partial ownership. The state owns 83% of Royal Bank of Scotland and 39% of Lloyds. In the case of Lloyds, following a \u00a320.6bn injection of funds. Another option was pursued in the case of Dunfermline building society, which like the Britannia building society began offering loans on risky property deals at the height of the housing boom. Dunfermline, which was unable to raise extra funds from its members to cover bad debts, was absorbed into the Bank of England on a Friday and transferred on the following Monday to the Nationwide. In each case the first \u00a3100,000 of individual savings are protected. New tougher rules agreed in Brussels are due to take effect later this year, though no date has yet been set. The Recovery and Resolution Directive will force investors that lend to banks to sacrifice some of their assets as part of any rescue plan. It will also force banks to offload profitable divisions to cover losses under a so-called \"living will\". The Co-op has in effect adopted the strategy put forward in the directive before it has become law, telling bondholders to sacrifice around a third of their holdings to pay a third of the \u00a31.5bn bailout package. The Co-op group will also sell its insurance arm.",

For the next full year we have no additional need for money,\" said Stournaras, referring to the country's current EU/IMF-sponsored rescue programme. \"All this speculation is premature. The EU [troika] money ends next July and that's when we'll have to judge the situation again. Nothing, absolutely nothing is certain yet.\" Athens's aim, he insisted, was to \"approach\" international capital markets \u2013 from which it has been excluded since 2010 \u2013 which would preclude the need for further aid to plug a funding gap in 2014 and 2015 variously estimated at between \u20ac9.5bn (\u00a38.12bn) and \u20ac11.1bn. \"There is a possibility that next year we will have entered the market again provided we fulfil two conditions, securing a primary surplus [before interest payments on debt] and a positive growth rate [after six years of economic contraction],\" he added.

Athens' debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to reach 174%, or \u20ac320bn, by the end of the year according to government figures released earlier this week. \"Recent developments definitely are positive. Revenues are increasing and the recession seems to be easing,\" he said emphasising that most of the turnaround had been due to Greece's spectacular tourist season. \"We've seen a 37% increase in net revenue from tourism compared to last year. If we're lucky and it continues over the next two months there's a good chance the growth rate will exceed projections.\" The spectre of further economic assistance for Greece, no matter how small, is a frightening prospect if it comes on condition of more recession-inducing austerity.

The group said there would be no quick fixes as it embarked on a four-year turnaround plan, after reporting pre-tax losses of \u00a3709.4m in the Co-operative Bank in the six months to the end of June. The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), the City regulator, said the scale of the losses did not alter its demand that the Co-op plug the \u00a31.5bn hole in its balance sheet. The Co-op, which employs more than 100,000 people, warned of job losses as it restructures the wider group as well as the bank - but did not say how many staff will go.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vodafone is in talks to sell its stake in American mobile network Verizon Wireless, in a potential $130bn (\u00a384bn) deal that would rank as the largest corporate transaction since AOL bought Time Warner during the technology bubble. Confirmation from Vodafone that talks have resumed with its joint venture partner Verizon Communications sent the British company's shares to a 12-year high, causing a rally that halted a two-day slide in European markets prompted by fears of military action in Syria. Lowell McAdam, chief executive of Verizon Communications, appears to be within striking distance of achieving his company's long-held ambition to buy back the 45% of Verizon Wireless it does not already own. The group is reported to have approached a series of banks with a view to raising $60bn in order to fund the cash element of a deal that would see 50% of the balance paid in Verizon Communications shares. An announcement could come as early as next Monday, sources told Bloomberg. Analysts estimate the sale could mean dividends of up to \u00a325bn for Vodafone shareholders, representing enough cash to lift the British economy. The dividend could \"create an indirect wealth boost to spending in the UK,\" said Vicky Redwood, chief economist at Capital Economics. \"If Vodafone reinvested that money in the UK that could help boost UK business investment and the economy, with a further indirect boost to the public finances through tax receipts.\" Nomura bank puts the potential dividend at 50p per share, or just over \u00a325bn, a sum equal to the dividends paid by every listed company in the UK last quarter. From April to June, payouts to shareholders reached \u00a325.3bn, the largest ever quarterly total, according to Capita Registrars. \"There would certainly be positive implications for the UK economy,\" said Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets. \"Pension funds are going to be getting a bit of a windfall.\" The sale could also strengthen the pound, said Guy Peddy, an analyst at Macquarie Securities, who suggested the dividend could total \u00a320bn, with \u00a35bn of that flowing directly to UK funds. \"Vodafone will be selling dollars and buying sterling, in order to get the money back in the UK, and that would strengthen the UK exchange rate.\" While Vodafone's recent strategy has involved disposing of stakes in companies it did not control, its earlier taste for acquisitions set the record for the world's largest transaction in 2000, when the company paid \u20ac150bn (\u00a3128bn) to acquire Germany's Mannesmann. The Verizon sale would be the third largest such transaction in corporate history, just behind the $165bn AOL paid in a cash and shares deal to acquire media group Time Warner in 2001. The British company released a statement yesterday morning confirming the talks, saying: \"Vodafone notes the recent press speculation and confirms that it is in discussions with Verizon Communications Inc regarding the possible disposal of Vodafone's US group whose principal asset is its 45% interest in Verizon Wireless.\" Vodafone's chief executive, Vittorio Colao, informally polled his largest investors on the price they would be willing to accept, according to Robin Bienenstock, an analyst at Bernstein Research. The consensus seems to be $100bn net of tax, which would give an overall price of between $105bn and $135bn, depending on the tax structure and the value placed on the Verizon shares used to part-fund the acquisition. \"It's a mega deal,\" said Bienenstock, adding that Japanese rival Softbank or AT&amp;T of the US could move for Vodafone. \"There are two potential outcomes. Number one is Vodafone is immediately in play and the cash is used by Softbank or AT&amp;T to take over the whole of what's left of Vodafone. In that option you are not going to get a dividend in the UK. The second option is Vodafone pays out a special big dividend and has a whole series of acquisitions they are thinking of making, and that would be the better outcome for the UK.\" The remaining Vodafone businesses, which stretch from Britain to Turkey, and India to South Africa, could make attractive targets for foreign telecoms groups looking to gain scale. Masayoshi Son, chief executive of SoftBank, has a stated intention to become the \"world's largest company\".Any deal would present a tax-planning challenge for Vodafone, both from an accounting and a political perspective. The company has been attacked for its minimal contributions to the UK exchequer. Its share in Verizon Wireless is owned by a US-registered company and analysts assume the US government will claim most of any windfall. If Vodafone repatriates the cash for acquisitions or dividends, it could owe money to HM Revenue &amp; Customs. Vodafone is likely to use some cash to fund its expansion into fixed line broadband and television services. A \u00a36.6bn purchase of German cable group Kabel Deutschland is awaiting approval from regulators, and Vodafone is thought to be considering a similar purchase of Fastweb in Italy. As part of the transaction, Vodafone is expected to buy back Verizon's 23% stake in Vodafone Italia, which could be worth \u20ac4bn.\"This deal is extremely important for Vodafone for their convergence strategy toward more cable assets because pure mobile operators will certainly experience capacity bottlenecks in the future,\" said Leopold Salcher, an analyst at Raiffeisen Capital Management, calling $130 billion \"a very good price.\"Vodafone and Verizon have returned to the negotiating table after the latest in a series of talks ground to a halt this Spring. Verizon was created as a joint venture with Bell Atlantic Corporation in 2000 and grew to become America's largest cellular network. The owners came close to a deal as far back as 2004, with Vodafone agreeing to sell its stake if it could buy AT&amp;T Wireless. When the AT&amp;T deal fell through, so did the Verizon agreement. With Vodafone's shares up as high as 9% on Thursday, valuing the company at over \u00a3100bn, the market believes years of uncertainty over the ownership of its most valuable asset may be at an end. Biggest corporate deals 1 Mannesman The German telecoms group was bought by Vodafone for $203bn (\u00a3131bn) in 2000. Thirteen years later, this acquisition is still the largest in history. 2 Time Warner Acquired by online multinational AOL for $182bn including debt in 2001. After destroying value at both companies the merger was unpicked in 2009. Time Warner boss Jeff Bewkes called it the \"biggest mistake in corporate history\". 3 Philip Morris US cigarette firm Altria Group spun off its international tobacco business in 2008 to its shareholders, valuing the new entity at $113bn. 4 ABN-AMRO The $98bn break up of the Netherlands bank in 2007 proved one deal too many for its acquirer Royal Bank of Scotland, which had shared the deal with Fortis Group and Santander. 5 Bellsouth Acquired by AT&amp;T in 2006 in a stock swap valued at $89bn. 6 Warner-Lambert Pfizer pulled off the hostile takeover of its rival in 2000, in an $89bn deal which created the world's second largest drug maker. 7 Mobil Exxon merged with Mobil in 1999 in a blockbuster oil alliance that reunited parts of the Standard Oil monopoly to create what was then the world's third largest corporation. 8 Shell Transport &amp; Trading Another oil giant alliance saw Royal Dutch Petroleum complete its merger with the UK's Shell in 2005 for $80bn. 9 SmithKline Beecham Glaxo Wellcome's $79bn \"merger of equals\" with fellow UK firm SmithKline created the world's largest drugs company in 2000. 10 Suez French state owned Gaz de France merged with Paris-based energy group Suez in a reverse takeover completed in 2008, and valued at $75bn.

      "body": "<p>Vodafone is in talks to sell its stake in American mobile network Verizon Wireless, in a potential $130bn (\u00a384bn) deal that would rank as the largest corporate transaction since AOL bought Time Warner during the technology&#xa0;bubble.</p> <p>Confirmation from Vodafone that talks have resumed with its joint venture partner Verizon Communications sent the British company's shares to a 12-year high, causing a rally that halted a two-day slide in European markets prompted by fears of military action in Syria.</p> <p>Lowell McAdam, chief executive of Verizon Communications, appears to be within striking distance of achieving his company's long-held ambition to buy back the 45% of Verizon Wireless it does not already own.</p> <p>The group is reported to have approached a series of banks with a view to raising $60bn in order to fund the cash element of a deal that would see 50% of the balance paid in Verizon Communications shares. An announcement could come as early as next Monday, sources told Bloomberg.</p> <p>Analysts estimate the sale could mean dividends of up to \u00a325bn for Vodafone shareholders, representing enough cash to lift the British economy.</p> <p>The dividend could \"create an indirect wealth boost to spending in the UK,\" said Vicky Redwood, chief economist at Capital Economics. \"If Vodafone reinvested that money in the UK that could help boost UK business investment and the economy, with a further indirect boost to the public finances through tax receipts.\"</p> <p>Nomura bank puts the potential dividend at 50p per share, or just over \u00a325bn, a sum equal to the dividends paid by every listed company in the UK last quarter. From April to June, payouts to shareholders reached \u00a325.3bn, the largest ever quarterly total, according to Capita Registrars. \"There would certainly be positive implications for the UK economy,\" said Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets. \"Pension funds are going to be getting a bit of a windfall.\"</p> <p>The sale could also strengthen the pound, said Guy Peddy, an analyst at Macquarie Securities, who suggested the dividend could total \u00a320bn, with \u00a35bn of that flowing directly to UK funds. \"Vodafone will be selling dollars and buying sterling, in order to get the money back in the UK, and that would strengthen the UK exchange rate.\"</p> <p>While Vodafone's recent strategy has involved disposing of stakes in companies it did not control, its earlier taste for acquisitions set the record for the world's largest transaction in 2000, when the company paid \u20ac150bn (\u00a3128bn) to acquire Germany's Mannesmann.</p> <p>The Verizon sale would be the third largest such transaction in corporate history, just behind the $165bn AOL paid in a cash and shares deal to acquire media group Time Warner in 2001.</p> <p>The British company released a statement yesterday morning confirming the talks, saying: \"Vodafone notes the recent press speculation and confirms that it is in discussions with Verizon Communications Inc regarding the possible disposal of Vodafone's US group whose principal asset is its 45% interest in Verizon Wireless.\"</p> <p>Vodafone's chief executive, Vittorio Colao, informally polled his largest investors on the price they would be willing to accept, according to Robin Bienenstock, an analyst at Bernstein Research. The consensus seems to be $100bn net of tax, which would give an overall price of between $105bn and&#xa0;$135bn, depending on the tax structure and the value placed on the Verizon shares used to part-fund the acquisition.</p> <p>\"It's a mega deal,\" said Bienenstock, adding that Japanese rival Softbank or AT&amp;T of the US could move for Vodafone. \"There are two potential outcomes. Number one is Vodafone is immediately in play and the cash is used by Softbank or AT&amp;T to take over the whole of what's left of Vodafone. In that option you are not going to get a dividend in the UK. The second option is Vodafone pays out a special big dividend and has a whole series of acquisitions they are thinking of making, and that would be the better outcome for the UK.\"</p> <p>The remaining Vodafone businesses, which stretch from Britain to Turkey, and India to South Africa, could make attractive targets for foreign telecoms groups looking to gain scale. Masayoshi Son, chief executive of SoftBank, has a stated intention to become the \"world's largest company\".Any deal would present a tax-planning challenge for Vodafone, both from an accounting and a political perspective. The company has been attacked for its minimal contributions to the UK exchequer. Its share in Verizon Wireless is owned by a US-registered company and analysts assume the US government will claim most of any windfall. If Vodafone repatriates the cash for acquisitions or dividends, it could owe money to HM Revenue &amp; Customs.</p> <p>Vodafone is likely to use some cash to fund its expansion into fixed line broadband and television services. A \u00a36.6bn purchase of German cable group Kabel Deutschland is awaiting approval from regulators, and Vodafone is thought to be considering a similar purchase of Fastweb in Italy. As part of the transaction, Vodafone is expected to buy back Verizon's 23% stake in Vodafone Italia, which could be worth \u20ac4bn.\"This deal is extremely important for Vodafone for their convergence strategy toward more cable assets because pure mobile operators will certainly experience capacity bottlenecks in the future,\" said Leopold Salcher, an analyst at Raiffeisen Capital Management, calling $130 billion \"a very good price.\"Vodafone and Verizon have returned to the negotiating table after the latest in a series of talks ground to a halt this Spring. Verizon was created as a joint venture with Bell Atlantic Corporation in 2000 and grew to become America's largest cellular network.</p> <p>The owners came close to a deal as far back as 2004, with Vodafone agreeing to sell its stake if it could buy AT&amp;T Wireless. When the AT&amp;T deal fell through, so did the Verizon agreement. With Vodafone's shares up as high as 9% on Thursday, valuing the company at over \u00a3100bn, the market believes years of uncertainty over the ownership of its most valuable asset may be at an end.</p> <h2><strong>Biggest corporate deals</strong></h2> <p><strong>1 Mannesman</strong> The German telecoms group was bought by Vodafone for $203bn (\u00a3131bn) in 2000. Thirteen years later, this acquisition is still the largest in history.</p> <p><strong>2 Time Warner</strong> Acquired by online multinational AOL for $182bn including debt in 2001. After destroying value at both companies the merger was unpicked in 2009. Time Warner boss Jeff Bewkes called it the \"biggest mistake in corporate history\".</p> <p><strong>3 Philip Morris</strong> US cigarette firm Altria Group spun off its international tobacco business in 2008 to its shareholders, valuing the new entity at $113bn.</p> <p><strong>4 ABN-AMRO</strong> The $98bn break up of the Netherlands bank in 2007 proved one deal too many for its acquirer Royal Bank of Scotland, which had shared the deal with Fortis Group and Santander.</p> <p><strong>5 Bellsouth</strong> Acquired by AT&amp;T in 2006 in a stock swap valued at $89bn.</p> <p><strong>6 Warner-Lambert</strong> Pfizer pulled off the hostile takeover of its rival in 2000, in an $89bn deal which created the world's second largest drug maker.</p> <p><strong>7 Mobil</strong> Exxon merged with Mobil in 1999 in a blockbuster oil alliance that reunited parts of the Standard Oil monopoly to create what was then the world's third largest corporation.</p> <p><strong>8 Shell Transport &amp; Trading</strong> Another oil giant alliance saw Royal Dutch Petroleum complete its merger with the UK's Shell in 2005 for $80bn.</p> <p><strong>9 SmithKline Beecham</strong> Glaxo Wellcome's $79bn \"merger of equals\" with fellow UK firm SmithKline created the world's largest drugs company in 2000.</p> <p><strong>10 Suez</strong> French state owned Gaz de France merged with Paris-based energy group Suez in a reverse takeover completed in 2008, and valued at $75bn.</p> <p><em>Source: Thomson Reuters</em></p>",
