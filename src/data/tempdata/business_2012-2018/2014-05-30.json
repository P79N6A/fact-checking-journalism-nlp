As well as the electricity savings, the project will also lead to decreased water consumption (equivalent to 10 Olympic swimming pools), a saving of land equivalent to 10 football fields, and decreased CO2 emissions (the equivalent of a 50-hectare wood of adult conifers, the size of London's Green Park and St James's Park added together). The cave space in Val di Non, in the Trentino region of northern Italy, was created after a local building company extracted rock from the mountain for building purposes.

    "webTitle": "Rolls-Royce plans remote-controlled ships with no captain or crew on board", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A fleet of giant cargo ships, up to almost a quarter of a mile long and wider than a motorway, are to crisscross the world's oceans without a captain or crew on board. The remote-controlled vessels, which could set sail within the decade, are the latest development in the growing trend for unmanned vehicles, with drone aircraft already flying and Google planning to introduce driverless cars. Rolls-Royce, the British engineering company developing the ships, claims the unmanned ships will be cheaper, greener and safer than those with a full complement of captain and crew. \"It's about making the ships more safe,\" said Oskar Levander, Rolls-Royce's head of marine innovation and technology. \"If you look at most accidents in marine they are happening because of human error \u2013 a lack of concentration and people becoming tired. We can provide a safer, more comfortable and better way of steering the ship.\" Levander said marine technology had progressed so fast in recent years that most of the steering and control of ships was already automated, relieving captains of many of their traditional duties for large parts of long voyages. \"If you think about a captain today, most of the work he does every day is on [managing] the crew and bureaucracy \u2013 he is more of an administration person, but he is still trained in operating a ship,\" Levander said. \"You have these highly trained people but they only operate the ship a small part of the time \u2013 why not have them operate ships all the time?\" Under Rolls-Royce's plan captains will be relocated from the bridges of ships to unremarkable office blocks in London, Singapore or Oslo, from where they will control fleets of ships on big screens akin to air traffic control centres. \"Maybe a captain can operate 10 ships \u2026 it might be easier to have a pool of 10 captains in control of 100 ships,\" said Levander, a Finn working at Rolls-Royce's Blue Ocean research centre in \u00c5lesund, a small town known for its art nouveau architecture on Norway's remote western coast eight hours' drive from Oslo. For most the of voyage, captaining the ships will amount to little more than watching blinking lights travel across a computer screen. \"Then, when it approaches port, control of the ship is passed to a full bridge simulator with 360\u00b0 views.\" Levander said the simulators, which are already used for crew training and will be hooked up to dozens of cameras on the ships, would provide captains with a far better view of the vessel and any obstacles than they would have from the bridge. \"If we're going to do this, it must be as safe if not safer,\" he said. \"We can create a better view of reality. The camera can see better than the human eye, they can spot objects in the water that the human eye cannot.\" Levander brushes aside concerns that the ships could pose a danger to other seafarers and the environment. \"We have drone aircraft flying, we have [drone] helicopters, we have Google cars \u2013 these are situations where you need to react in a fraction of a second, with ships you have a lot of margin. A ship isn't going to run up and hit me,\" he said. \"The point is, who is normally in danger if you hit something? It is the crew on the ship, they are the ones that get injured. It is safer if they are not there in the dangerous position.\" If a ship does get into difficulties, spring a leak or lose the satellite link to the control centre it will \"go into safe mode, stop and float there until someone comes\". The technology, which will be tested on a real ship off the coast of \u00c5lesund in the next few months, will be used only on bulk cargo vessels and not passenger ships. Levander said the technology would be used on cargo cable ferries (which are guided across rivers on cables) within the next couple of years, \"but the real benefit will be in ocean going tankers and bulkers\", where remote control would cut operating costs by up to 30%. Spotting the potential cost savings, cargo companies are keen to get remote-controls ships on the water soon, but winning approval from the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the global regulator of shipping, is likely to take some time. If approval is granted, Levander reckons more than half of the world's bulk cargo ships will become remote-controlled, with container ships following later. \"We have ship owners who are seriously interested, but they know they are not going to sign the contract on them this year or next year \u2013 it will take some time.\" The new technology is likely to be most popular in northern Europe, where most marine technology is developed and where crew wages are the most expensive. The prospect of remote-controlled ships comes as cargo companies are beginning to struggle to find people willing to spend months at sea on not hugely generous wages. \"Young people don't want to go into shipping any more, it's not attractive,\" Levander said. \"In the past you joined up to see the world, today you take a low-cost airline ticket and go.\" The EU is funding a \u20ac3.8m (\u00a33m) study into the safety and feasibility of unmanned vessels. The maritime unmanned navigation through intelligence in networks (Munin) programme said: \"Seagoing professions are increasingly perceived as unattractive these days.\" \"Remote-control shipping will also make a captain's life more appealing as they will no longer have to leave their families for months on end,\" Levander said. \"We can provide the possibility of working in shipping but doing it from an office near your home where you can drive back home after a day's work. \"In the future, we would like to spread them [the shipping control centres] out around the world so you only have daytime jobs.\" Not having crews will remove the need for heating, air conditioning, sewage systems and lifeboats, freeing up even more space for cargo. It will also lead to a comprehensive redesign of ships, stripping out the bridge, handle rails and access points, allowing a sleeker shape and making life much harder for pirates attempting a hijacking. \"If you take the crew off you have much less interest for the pirates because you don't have hostages,\" Levander said. \"Even if they do get on board what are they going to do? You can remotely shut down the ship. They can sit there on the ship in the middle of the ocean but they cannot steer it \u2013 you can drive them to the nearest military base.\"",

Next month, on 13 June, after nearly 150 years, the last remaining handful of Dunfermline building society branches will disappear.

Dunfermline, whose 34 branches hold \u00a32bn in deposits and have 300,000 customers, was rescued by Nationwide in 2009 after the government refused to bail out the loss-making organisation.

It is a business that claims to be built on the foundations of the Caledonian Insurance Company, founded in Edinburgh in 1805. It became part of the Guardian group of companies in 1958 and the name slipped out of sight before it was resurrected in Ireland. Scottish Amicable, founded in 1826, is another venerable brand that was eroded by history, despite becoming one of Scotland's best-known fund managers.

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of JD Sports Fashion, Barry Bown, is to step down after 14 years in the job, collecting a near \u00a3900,000 pay-off but continuing to work as a consultant. Bown, 52, who joined JD in 1984 said he wanted more leisure time and would be practising his golf after recently buying his first set of clubs, but he would also continue to offer advice to JD on business and store development. JD shares lost 22p to close at \u00a316.13, but are up from 900p a year ago. The heads of JD's various retail chains, which include its main core sports fashion chain JD Sports as well as outdoorwear stores Blacks and Millets and a string of branded fashion chains Scotts, Bank and Tessuti, will continue to report into JD's executive chairman Peter Cowgill, as they have been doing for about 18 months. In an unusual move, Cowgill said the group would not be looking for a replacement for Bown but intended to train people within the business to potentially take on the role in future. \"When we have brought in outside people in the past it's a bit like a liver transplant, sometimes it takes and sometimes it doesn't, so we want to enhance people we've got and bring them through. Barry has been gradually taking a lighter load over a period of time so this is no big deal.\" Some questioned the quirky arrangement, which leaves Cowgill in sole charge. Retail analyst Nick Bubb suggested Cowgill, whose core skills he thinks lie in buying new businesses, would need more assistance with the everyday running of the group. \"It's a pretty big operation and while the core business is in good shape there are lots of new divisions which I would have thought need knocking together. I definitely feel they need a chief executive.\" Cowgill said the unusual management structure had the backing of JD's main shareholder Pentland Group, which owns 57% of the shares. JD's shares are very tightly held with Newcastle United boss Mike Ashley's Sports Direct owning about 12% and Aberforth Partners 10%.",

Barry has been gradually taking a lighter load over a period of time so this is no big deal.\"</p> <p>Some questioned the quirky arrangement, which leaves Cowgill in sole charge. Retail analyst Nick Bubb suggested Cowgill, whose core skills he thinks lie in buying new businesses, would need more assistance with the everyday running of the group. \"It's a pretty big operation and while the core business is in good shape there are lots of new divisions which I would have thought need knocking together. I definitely feel they need a chief executive.\"</p> <p>Cowgill said the unusual management structure had the backing of JD's main shareholder Pentland Group, which owns 57% of the shares.</p> <p>JD's shares are very tightly held with Newcastle United boss Mike Ashley's Sports Direct owning about 12% and Aberforth Partners 10%.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The US Justice Department is reportedly pushing for a $10bn fine to be levied against BNP Paribas to settle charges that the French bank flouted economic sanctions against Iran, Sudan and other countries. The potential fine, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, is likely to be accompanied by an admission of wrongdoing and comes amid a crackdown on banks by the Justice Department. At $10bn, the settlement would be more than five times the $1.9bn agreement the Justice Department reached with HSBC over its sanctions violations in 2012. In Paris, the bank\u2019s share price dropped sharply on news of the possible scale of the penalty. BNP warned in April that it could end up paying much more than the $1.1bn it had set aside to settle charges, but the new figure is far higher than most previous estimates. BNP is being investigated by federal authorities and New York\u2019s financial authorities over transactions from Cuba, Iran and Sudan that may have violated US money-laundering rules as well as the economic sanctions that ban US bank offices from doing business with those countries. HSBC\u2019s 2012 fine was for similar charges. The then-record payment related to transactions HSBC made that benefited Mexican drug cartels as well as countries the US considered \u201crogue states\u201d \u2013 including Iran, Libya and Sudan. But the British bank was also able to escape without admitting criminal wrongdoing. On top of the potentially huge fine, BNP Paribas could suffer a temporary ban on processing dollar transactions, a business that is essential to the operations of an international bank. Benjamin Lawsky, New York's aggressive superintendent of financial services, is said to be seeking a suspension. The record-breaking fine that could be imposed upon France's largest bank has alarmed French authorities. Christian Noyer, the governor of the Bank of France, said earlier this month that BNP's did not violate European or French laws. \"We have indeed verified that all the transactions were in line with EU and French rules, regulations and directives,\" Noyer said at a news conference. \"So there have been no breaches.\" If the fine is imposed, it would come shortly after the Justice Department fined Credit Suisse for running what senators called a \u201ccloak-and-dagger\u201d scheme to help 22,000 US customers hide billions from the tax authorities. That fine showed \u201cno financial institution no matter its size or global reach is above the law,\u201d attorney general Eric Holder said at the time. The Justice Department has toughened its stance on fining banks after stinging criticism from Congress and elsewhere of fines related to the financial crisis that have left the banks largely unscathed and have avoided any charges of criminal wrongdoing. The US authorities declined to comment, as did a spokesman for BNP Paribas in London.",

Germany's Dax edged up 4.37 points to 9943.27 while France's CAC lost 10.94 points, or 0.2%, to 4519.57. Spain's Ibex rose nearly 70 points to 10798.7, a 0.6% gain, and Italy's FTSE MIB added 118.36 points, or 0.55%, to 21629.71. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones was trading down nearly 18 points at 16681.21, a 0.1% fall, while the S&amp;P 500 was flat at 1921.40 and the Nasdaq was also little changed at 4245.92. The dollar slipped against other major currencies as traders tidied up their books at the end of the month, and ahead of next week's European Central Bank meeting. You can find a summary of today's events here. Thanks for all your great comments. Good night all, and have a good weekend. We'll be back on Monday. The latest growth figures from India have underlined the challenge facing its new government. GDP rose by an annual rate of 4.6% in the first three months of 2014: During the 2013-14 financial year, output grew by 4.7% - the second year in a row of sub-5% growth. Time for a quick recap, with links to the main points in the blog. The International Monetary Fund has urged Tokyo's government to consider bolder fiscal stimulus measures, to avoid Japan's Abenomics programme faltering. IMF deputy MD David Lipton warned that Japan's exports were not growing as fast as hoped; it can't afford to see the yen strengthen, he said. A fall in Japanese factory output also raised fears that the economy is stumbling. Shares in French bank BNP Paribas fell reports that it faces a $10bn fine for sanction-busting. It could be the biggest fine for breaking sanctions ever. They're down 3.5% in late trading -- a slight recovery, after France's far-right National Front urged the country's government to fight the charges and protect their biggest bank (more details on fastFT). The boss of retail chain Kingfisher has said that investment will be halted in Scotland if it votes to break away from the rest of the UK..... ...while his counterpart at JD Sports has stepped down, and could be appearing at a golf course near you soon. Sweden's economy has suffered a surprise fall in GDP, after exports failed to grow as fast as imports. World stock markets are ending the week calmly, with small falls in Europe and the US. Analysts suggests that a correction could be round the corner.... It's not been a great week for goldbugs. The gold price hit its lowest level in nearly four months today, and was on track for its biggest weekly decline in two months. Signs of weaker demand in Asia have hit gold, as investors move money into stocks instead. The spot price of gold is down 0.7% today at $1,246.40 an ounce this afternoon (updated). A quiet start to trading on Wall Street has seen the main indices fall slightly in early trading. Here's the situation: The S&amp;P has hit a series of record highs this month, and has gained almost 2% since the end of April. So much for selling in May and clearing off... Joao Monteiro, analyst at Valutrades, suggests: At the risk of sounding like a broken record, markets are very toppy and a reversion remains a case of \"when\" not \"if\". JD Sports' departing CEO Barry Bown will be spending more time with his golf clubs, reports my colleague Sarah Butler: Barry Bown from JD will be stepping down as chief executive with a pay-off to become a consultant to the business. In a typically quirky move from the sports retailer, Bown will practice his golf a couple of extra days a week but continue to advise on business development while the heads of JD Group's several retail chains will report directly into chairman Peter Cowgill as they have been doing for 18 months anyway. JD Sport shares have fallen 1% following the news that CEO Barry Bown is leaving. Just in -- the boss of JD Sports has resigned with immediate effect. The high street retailer told shareholders that Barry Bown is stepping down after \"30 years of significant contribution to the growth and development of the Company\". And there will be \"no immediate replacement\", suggesting executive chairman Peter Cowgill will run the show, at least for a while. In a statement, Cowgill said: \"The Board would like to thank Barry for his valued and considerable contribution to the growth and progress of the business. We look forward to his continued support as a consultant to the Company.\" We learned yesterday that the US economy shrank for the first time in three years between January and March. And the latest consumer spending data has dampened hopes that growth will surge back in this quarter. Consumer spending fell 0.1% in April -- the first monthly decline in a year -- surprising economists who anticipated a 0.2% rise. It's not an alarm signal -- after all, sales jumped 1% in March, so maybe people just cut back. But it underlines that a strong US recovery isn't a given. The boss of Kingfisher, which owns the home improvements chain B&amp;Q, has said today that investment in Scotland would be frozen if it votes to break away from the rest of the UK. Sir Ian Cheshire added his voice to those warning that a Yes vote in this autumn's independence vote would have serious repercussions. It comes as the official referendum campaign begins -- my colleague Claire Phipps is covering it all in her live blog. A Yes vote would create uncertainty over Scotland's place in the European Union and what currency it would use, Cheshire said. This would mean a pause in investment north of the border, but Kingfisher does not plan to quit Scotland. Cheshire was speaking at newest B&amp;Q warehouse in Port Glasgow, Inverclyde. Press Association has the details: Sir Ian, speaking at his newest B&amp;Q warehouse in Port Glasgow, Inverclyde, insisted he will not pull out if Scots decide to leave the union. But he said: \"It would put a pause on everything. \"If we have differences on VAT, currency, it just puts everything into hibernation as we try to figure out what it will mean. \"At the end of that we have to consider what is the trading environment. \"Because Scotland is such an important part of B&amp;Q, there's no way we're going to let it go, but it would be more complicated, probably more costly and less likely to attract investment, given we could invest in 11 other countries around the world.\" Kingfisher currently operates 27 Screwfix outlets in Scotland. It hopes to open another 23 -- but Cheshire suggests a decision is on hold. PA reports: He would have to \"wait and see\" if conditions were good enough to open more stores, including plans to take the number of Screwfix outlets up to 50 in Scotland. \"Those may or may not happen as a result,\" he said. And Cheshire also touched on the issue of whether an independent Scotland would find it easy to join the EU as a new member: \"Technically, the UK is part of the EU and if you leave the UK you will have to reapply... \"I spend a lot of time in Brussels and I've been told this consistently by a large number of people. \"We see a real problem here and see a real problem with the currency because I just don't see any way in which the UK Government in Westminster is going to agree to a currency union. \"I've heard this up close and personal from both sides of the Coalition, so there has to be some sort of alternative. Quite a forthright intervention... Do keep watching Claire's liveblog for the latest from Scotland Missed this earlier -- but Sweden's economy has suffered a small, surprise contraction, hit by a deteriorating net trade balance. Swedish GDP fell by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of this year. Exports only rose 3% year-on-year, lagging the 5.2% rise in imports, and eating into the growth rate. Economists had expected a small expansion of around 0.1%. The news hit the krona, on speculation that the country's central bank may be forced to cut rates. But analysts reckon that the underlying picture is OK. Andreas Wallstrom of Nordea Bank explained: \u201cIf one looks at the components, for example investments and exports, they were better than we had expected. Household consumption continues to push on so if one looks at the demand components things look pretty good.\u201d Household consumption grew 2.1%, government spending climbed 1.4%, and business investment jumped by 7.7%. On an annual basis, Sweden's output rose by 1.9%. A reminder of how BNP Paribas is facing the biggest fine yet for busting US sanctions. Speaking of the European Central Bank, David Keohane of Alphaville has written a piece about the options which its governing council could deploy next week's policy-setting meeting. It shows that most analyst expect interest rate cuts, but only a handful believe the ECB will embark on a quantitative easing programme: Th old mantra of \"Sell in May and Go Away\" didn't really work out this year, with the FTSE 100 up around 70 points, or 1.1%, this month. That's partly thanks to a string of record highs on Wall Street, and partly due to speculation of new stimulus measures by the European Central Bank next week. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, warns that the rally must break at some point.... A fresh record high for the S&amp;P 500 has failed to enthuse London markets, as some worrying news from China sent miners lower. Chinese government figures indicated manufacturing growth was weakening, contradicting recent signs of improvement in the economy and providing an excuse for some selling in raw materials. In addition, a profit warning from Fenner served as a reminder that the situation is not entirely rosy. Warnings seem to be coming through with disturbing regularity, and the sharp drops in share prices that follow suggest that investor sentiment is far from being rock solid. Even now, many are uncomfortable with valuations at current levels, a signal that the push towards 6900 is likely to be delayed once again. The S&amp;P 500\u2019s steady accumulation of gains carried on yesterday, raising questions about how long this winning streak can continue. The GDP figure had been so widely expected that its overall impact was negligible, but the Chicago PMI number this afternoon is also expected to be weaker, leaving traders wondering how long the market can continue to ignore bad news. \u2018Sell in May\u2019 appears to have been cancelled due to lack of interest, so now we see if June will provide any succour for the bears. Maybe this year's advice should be \"Sell in June before stocks swoon?\". Greek retail sales have fallen again - with volumes falling 0.8% year-on-year in March as the country's long recession continues to hit shoppers. ELSTAT, the country's stats body, also revised February's data to show a welcome 0.9% rise in sales volumes. UK retailer John Lewis continues to enjoy a good May - sales across the chain jumped by 14.2% last week, compared to a year ago. Consumer confidence hit a nine-month high this month; and IHS's Howard Archer reckons the trend will continue -- if real wages outpace inflation this year. The fundamentals for consumers are currently improving overall, and they should continue to do so over the coming months as employment continues to rise and earnings growth likely trends higher than inflation. A profits warning from FTSE 250-firm Fenner (maker of conveyer belts to the mining industry) has helped knock shares in London this morning. Mining firms are leading the FTSE 100 fallers, after Fenner warned that weakness in the U.S. coal sector meant it would miss earnings targets. The FTSE 100 is down 15 points at 6855. BNP Paribas's 5% tumble has pulled the Paris market down - France's CAC index has fallen 0.5%. And the German DAX is flat. Overnight, Greece's opposition leader Alexis Tsipras has emphatically ruled out an alliance in the European Parliament with Britain's Nigel Farage. Tsipras said groups such as UK Independence Party and France's National Front party were \u201cmonstrosities\u201d created by Europe's drive into austerity, calling his Syriza party an \"oasis\". Tsipras declared: \"We are a pro-European force that wants to change Europe, not dismantle it. \u201cAusterity has led to the creation of political monstrosities.\u201d More here: Tsipras calls Farage monstrosity created by austerity The Bank of France says it is following the US Justice Department sanctions busting case against BNP Paribas with the \"utmost attention\". A spokeswoman said: \"The Bank of France has no comment to make for now since negotiations are still in progress. The governor of the Bank of France is following this case with the utmost attention.\" (quote via Reuters) Back to the International Monetary Fund's worries about Japan (details here), and the Fund's deputy managing director, David Lipton, has warned that parts of the Japanese economy are under-performing. Lipton told Reuters that Tokyo needs to improve its competitiveness and growth potential, while also avoiding the yen appreciating in value. \"If anything, we've been seeing Japan experiencing slower export growth than Japan had expected and we had expected,\" \"There's a need for Japan to strengthen its competitiveness. So we don't believe that strengthening of the yen at this point would be helpful because that would go in an opposite direction from that important need.\" Shares in French bank BNP Paribas have tumbled over 5% in Paris, as traders rush to sell following reports that it could be fined $10bn by US authorities for breaking sanctions. That's twice as much as the previous estimate, leaving BNP facing a heavy price for allegedly flouting US economic sanctions against several countries including against Iran and Sudan. A $10bn fine would be the biggest penalty imposed on a bank for sanction-busting (HSBC was fined almost $2bn, with several other banks handing over hundreds of millions of dollars). The WSJ has the story. Here's a flavour: European banks have been the target of many of the recent U.S. fines. The pursuit, with cumulative penalties in the ballpark of $10 billion, has triggered private grumbling among European finance executives and some regulators there. The mounting frustration helps explain why some French leaders appear to be rallying around BNP. Christian Noyer, the governor of the Bank of France, said this month that BNP's alleged actions didn't violate European or French laws. A final resolution of the yearslong U.S. investigation of the French bank is likely weeks away, and it is possible the ultimate settlement amount could total far less than $10 billion. BNP is looking to pay less than $8 billion, according to the people familiar with the settlement discussions, although a person close to the bank said its negotiators haven't mentioned the $8 billion figure in talks with U.S. authorities. BNP and the U.S. authorities also are negotiating whether the bank will temporarily lose the ability to transfer money into and out of the U.S., the people said. Friday has started well for Latvia -- Standard &amp; Poor's raised its credit rating by one notch to A- (the seventh highest rating) this morning. S&amp;P cited Latvia's strong growth prospects, membership of the euro-area and falling government debt (as a percentage of GDP). Another reason to be worried about Japan - factory output fell 2.5% month-on-month in April. That dashed hopes of growth, with the ministry of economy, trade and industry warning that \"production appears to be flat\" at present. Ironically, the IMF's warning comes as Japan's core inflation rate hit 3.2% in April. But... that's because Tokyo hikes its sales tax last month, from 5% to 8%. If you strip that out, then inflation rose by just 1.5% -- still shy of Japan's target of 2%. And core inflation excluding energy and food (which are volatile) is much lower still. I've lifted this chart from fastFT to show the detail: Is Abenomics - Japan's great hope for a return to growth - running out of steam? The International Monetary Fund gave the Japanese government a firm nudge this morning, with a new report warning that Tokyo may need to implement more aggressive economic reforms. Otherwise, the IMF warns, prime minister Shinzo Abe's \"Third Arrow\" of structural reforms to make Japan fit for the 21st century may flounder. That would lead to Japan sinking back into deflation, and and investors losing faith in its ability to repay its debt mountain. In a new report, the Fund said: Over the medium term, transitioning to self-sustaining growth requires greater structural and fiscal reform efforts to avoid slipping back into deflation, overburdening monetary policy, and undermining confidence in the sustainability of government debt. It urged more forceful structural reforms for Abenomics to succeed, such as: \"Concrete measures\" to increase the supply and productivity of labor, put savings to more productive use, and eliminate barriers to investment. Raising the employment of women and older workers and accepting more foreign labour Deregulating agriculture and domestic services sectors further, to raise productivity, competition, and inward investment. And Japan's aging population remains a big worry to the Fund. Because of further declines in the working-age population due to aging, staff projects potential growth to remain below 1 percent over the medium term The IMF also warned that it does not believe Tokyo will hit its target of an annual inflation rate of 2% until 2017 - later than the government is aiming for. It predicted \"a more gradual closure of the output gap and rise in inflation expectations\" than planned. And for that reason, the IMF wants the Bank of Japan to be vigilant, saying: The BoJ should act quickly if actual or expected inflation stagnates or growth disappoints. The full report is here. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, economics, business and the eurozone. Japan's in focus today, as the International Monetary Fund warns that Tokyo may need to operate an \"aggressive monetary policy\" for longer than planned, to avoid sinking back into a low-inflationary mire. Full details and reaction to follow.... In the eurozone, we'll be watching reaction to reports that BNP Paribas is being pushed to pay a $10bn fine by US authorities for breaching sanctions rules. And in the UK, another clutch of surveys have found that the British economy continues to recovery. The CBI reckons economic prospects are at their brightest for a decade - and the British Chamber of Commerce has hiked its growth forecast for this year. Britain's economic prospects brightest in more than a decade, survey finds I'll be tracking the main events through the day as usual -- it may prove to be a quiet Friday, so do flag up anything I miss....",

    "webTitle": "Scottish independence: B&Q boss warns over split in event of yes vote", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher has warned that the DIY group will put investment in Scotland on hold if the country splits from the UK and told Scots that from a business point of view they should vote against independence. Sir Ian Cheshire, pictured below, said a yes vote in September's referendum would create too many uncertainties for the international retailer to press ahead with investment. Kingfisher's plans to almost double the size of the Screwfix chain in Scotland by adding 23 branches would be shelved, he added. Cheshire joined the chief executive of Diageo, which controls 40% of whisky production, in expressing concerns about the impact of independence as the referendum entered its official campaign period before the vote on 18 September. In a planned intervention speaking at the newest B&amp;Q warehouse in Port Glasgow, Inverclyde, Cheshire told the Press Association: \"It would put a pause on everything. If we have differences on VAT, currency, it just puts everything into hibernation as we try to figure out what it will mean. At the end of that we have to consider what is the trading environment. \"Because Scotland is such an important part of B&amp;Q, there's no way we're going to let it go, but it would be more complicated, probably more costly and less likely to attract investment, given we could invest in 11 other countries around the world.\" The intervention by the FTSE 100 retailer's boss is one of the strongest statements on independence from the boss of a large UK company. The insurer and fund manager Standard Life, one of Scotland's most famous native companies, warned in February it would move much of its business to England after a yes vote. The boss of Shell said in March that staying in the UK was better for the oil industry, which is a big part of Scotland's economy. Cheshire said Scotland would be able to operate effectively as an independent country but staying in the union was the better option. \"From a business point of view I would strongly not advise it \u2026 As a business, through our lens, it is clearly better to be part of the UK.\" B&amp;Q employs more than 2,600 people in Scotland out of about 21,000 in the UK. Screwfix has 27 shops in Scotland and employs almost 400 people. Cheshire said practical problems could include changing Kingfisher's UK computer system and repricing thousands of products. Ivan Menezes, Diageo's chief executive, told the Wall Street Journal staying in the European Union was important so the production of Johnnie Walker, Talisker and other whiskies continued to benefit from trade agreements. Menezes refused to come down on either side in the debate but said tax and currency uncertainties could damage the whisky industry, one of Scotland's most important sectors. \"What we will fight for is keeping our industry competitive and thriving, and we're very clear on what that requires,\" he said. Menezes made his most forthright remarks so far on independence after a Guardian investigation into Scotland's wealth found that more than 80% of the country's whisky industry is owned by non-Scottish companies. The inquiry found that income owned and kept in Scotland is up to \u00a320bn less than the headline GDP figure of \u00a3144.7bn because of the extent of foreign ownership of industries including North Sea oil and gas, finance and whisky. Cheshire echoed Menezes' concerns about Scotland's future in the EU under independence. Continuing doubts about whether Scotland would keep the pound added to uncertainties for business, he added. \"Technically, the UK is part of the EU and if you leave the UK you will have to reapply,\" he said. \"We see a real problem here and see a real problem with the currency because I just don't see any way in which the UK government in Westminster is going to agree to a currency union.\" The Scottish government's white paper on independence claims there would be a smooth transition to EU membership in the 18 months between a yes vote and formal independence in 2016. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, which owns Bank of Scotland, would probably have to move their head offices south of the border for regulatory reasons if Scotland split from the UK. Airlines are more favourable to the idea of independence. British Airways and Ryanair have supported first minister Alex Salmond's plan to cut and then maybe abolish air passenger duty. Cheshire discussed his views on the referendum with Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont and local Labour MSP Duncan McNeil when he visited Port Glasgow.",

All three experimental medicines, which treat lung and ovarian cancer, are to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's (ASCO) annual meeting, and AstraZeneca claim their progress is ahead of rival drugs.</p> <p>AstraZeneca's boss, Pascal Soriot, is under pressure from investors to deliver top-selling treatments and prove that the drugmaker can thrive on its own after fighting off an unwanted approach from Pfizer, which was forced to drop its interest on Monday. As part of his defence strategy, Soriot had pledged a 75% increase in annual sales to $45bn (\u00a327bn) by 2023, with the new cancer treatments playing a significant role in the forecasts.</p> <p>The company will present clinical data on its lung cancer treatments AZD9291 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/14/astrazeneca-cancer-drug-med14736-trials\" title=\"\">MEDI4736</a>, and the results of an intermediate phase II study conducted by the US National Cancer Institute on an ovarian cancer treatment.</p> <p>About 30,000 doctors and scientists from the pharmaceutical industry, academia and the public sector are expected to attend the conference. Soriot is attending along with his top scientists.</p> <p>Dubbed the \"new great white hope\" in the battle against cancer, AZD9291 shrank tumours in more than half of patients who had developed resistance to established treatments, according to an early study. The experimental treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer, was developed in Cheshire and has been granted breakthrough therapy status by the US drug regulator.</p> <p>It took just 10 months for AZD9291 to go from early to late-stage clinical trials, skipping the intermediage stage. Bahija Jallal, who runs AstraZeneca's biologics arm MedImmune, told the Guardian: \"It's not very often that you have a molecule that shows you activity very early, at the first dose in phase I.

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca will this weekend give an update on the three cancer drugs that were at the centre of its succesful defence against a \u00a369bn takeover proposal by its US rival Pfizer. Nearly a week after winning its battle for independence, the British pharmaceutical group will showcase some of its new treatments at the world's largest cancer conference in Chicago. All three experimental medicines, which treat lung and ovarian cancer, are to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's (ASCO) annual meeting, and AstraZeneca claim their progress is ahead of rival drugs. AstraZeneca's boss, Pascal Soriot, is under pressure from investors to deliver top-selling treatments and prove that the drugmaker can thrive on its own after fighting off an unwanted approach from Pfizer, which was forced to drop its interest on Monday. As part of his defence strategy, Soriot had pledged a 75% increase in annual sales to $45bn (\u00a327bn) by 2023, with the new cancer treatments playing a significant role in the forecasts. The company will present clinical data on its lung cancer treatments AZD9291 and MEDI4736, and the results of an intermediate phase II study conducted by the US National Cancer Institute on an ovarian cancer treatment. About 30,000 doctors and scientists from the pharmaceutical industry, academia and the public sector are expected to attend the conference. Soriot is attending along with his top scientists. Dubbed the \"new great white hope\" in the battle against cancer, AZD9291 shrank tumours in more than half of patients who had developed resistance to established treatments, according to an early study. The experimental treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer, was developed in Cheshire and has been granted breakthrough therapy status by the US drug regulator. It took just 10 months for AZD9291 to go from early to late-stage clinical trials, skipping the intermediage stage. Bahija Jallal, who runs AstraZeneca's biologics arm MedImmune, told the Guardian: \"It's not very often that you have a molecule that shows you activity very early, at the first dose in phase I. What we can promise is we keep that momentum until we bring it to patients. When you have something like that on your hands it becomes almost a duty to bring it to patients as quickly as possible.\" Analysts at UBS note that the early results are from a large study, \"which makes this a much more robust signal of efficacy\" than results reported by AstraZeneca's US rival Clovis Oncology for a similar drug. UBS added that the results \"should substantially increase confidence in a late 2015 filing [for regulatory approval] and 2016 launch of this compound.\" Another AstraZeneca lung cancer drug, MEDI4736, has been fast-tracked to late-stage clinical trials and is being tested in combination with other compounds. AstraZeneca is in a race with Roche, Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb, who are working on similar drugs, to be first to market, and was the first to start late-stage testing, with a filing planned for 2016 or earlier. Jallal said immunotherapy, which harnesses the body's immune system to fight disease and underpins the AZD9291 and MEDI4736 treatments, had improved dramatically. Ed Bradley, who heads oncology research and development at MedImmune, said: \"We've learned over the last 10 to 15 years how to detect the ways the cancer cells escape immune detection \u2026 You can now take the brakes off or put the gas on the immune system and we are seeing very durable responses in a variety of tumour types so we really think that this can be transformational.

      "bodyText": "The discount retailer B&amp;M is seeking a valuation of up to \u00a32.9bn as it joins the faltering trail of companies planning to float on the stock market this year. The Liverpool-based general merchandise chain has set the range for its initial public offering (IPO) at between 230p and 290p a share, according to sources. That will be used to put a price on the company in discussions with City investors, and values B&amp;M at between \u00a32.3bn and \u00a32.9bn. When B&amp;M announced its intention to float last week it was said to be looking for a valuation of about \u00a32.5bn. The \u00a32.6bn midpoint of the range is said to indicate would-be shareholders' initial enthusiasm for B&amp;M's growth plans. A float price at the top of the range would make the stake of Simon and Bobby Arora, the two brothers who bought the chain 10 years ago, worth \u00a31.1bn and position the company just outside the FTSE 100 index of Britain's biggest companies. If the offer is priced at the middle of the range, the brothers' stake will be worth \u00a31bn. B&amp;M has been joined by the Australian fashion website MySale in raising money from investors. MySale \u2013 which is backed by Topshop owner Sir Philip Green, who owns 25% \u2013 announced its IPO plans on Thursday and is said to be seeking a valuation of \u00a3300m to \u00a3400m. The retailers are pressing ahead with their IPOs as the market for flotations cools down from the frenzy in the first few months of the year. Fat Face pulled its float last week because fund managers rejected the \u00a3440m valuation placed on the casualwear store chain by its private equity owners. Saga, the over-50s travel and insurance group also owned by buyout firms, was forced to price its IPO at the bottom of its intended range. Investors have become wary of lofty valuations demanded by private equity firms to cash in their investments, many made at the market peak before the financial crisis. Card Factory, Pets at Home and Just Eat have all fallen below their IPO prices since the companies sold shares in the last three months, making investors more choosy about which companies can benefit from renewed consumer confidence and economic growth. B&amp;M is chaired by former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy and 60% owned by private equity outfit Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, where Leahy is a partner. The remainder is held by the Arora brothers. The company has 370 stores selling household merchandise including electrical goods, furniture and garden equipment at knockdown prices. Simon Arora said last week that investors believed B&amp;M was a growth story with the potential to feed shoppers' rediscovered desire for bargains. He plans to open 40 stores a year in the UK over the next 10 years and expand in Germany. Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice is also reported to one of the bidders considering a \u00a3300m-plus takeover of outdoor clothes and camping chain Cotswold Outdoor, according to Sky News. Bidders tabling provisional offers this week for the Belgian-based business are also understood to include Sports Direct. Other businesses preparing for IPOs include easyJet founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou's easyHotel chain and Zoopla, the property website.",
