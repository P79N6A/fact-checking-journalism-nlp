Back in 2007, when the now departing Sir Andrew Witty landed the chief executive\u2019s job, the affair was long and bloody. Three internal contenders were invited to pitch their ideas in a semi-public shoot-out. Witty, the youngest and most junior executive, won and the disappointed duo wouldn\u2019t stay for love nor share options. They departed within months. It was a bracing experience and not one you\u2019d think GSK would wish to repeat. There is every chance it will. Witty won\u2019t leave until next March, which creates plenty of time for plots, intrigue and manoeuvring. Did finance director Simon Dingemans, when he quit Goldman Sachs in 2010 to do a real job, aspire to succeed Witty? It is even hard to say who is the leading candidate within the core pharmaceutical business. Is it Abbas Hussain, head of the division, or Patrick Vallance, head of research and development? And perhaps Emma Walmsley, boss of consumer healthcare, a bigger unit after being beefed via a shuffle of assets with Novartis, is a decent outside bet. This time around, external candidates will also have to be considered. Amid it all, the noisy shareholders will want a say. Lauded fund manager Neil Woodford wants GSK to be broken up and, presumably, a boss who is open to the idea. His campaign has started already. The best advice for chairman Sir Philip Hampton, hardened by his years at Royal Bank of Scotland, is to get the appointment done quickly to minimise the fallout. As for Witty\u2019s legacy, it\u2019s easy to forget that drug companies, rather than banks, were the chief corporate bogeymen a decade ago. One of Witty\u2019s first acts was to make HIV drugs available at affordable prices in developing countries. He has also led the way on opening access to clinical research and stopped the indefensible practice of paying doctors to champion individual medicines. In an often unlovely industry, those were smart moves. The serious blemish on his watch was the corruption scandal in China in 2013, for which GSK paid a \u00a3300m fine and had to make a comically fawning apology. Witty had also been paid far too much \u2013 another \u00a36.6m last year, for heaven\u2019s sake \u2013 but the entire pharma industry works like that. As for GSK\u2019s financial record under Witty, it is surely better than the share price \u2013 \u00a311.20 to \u00a314 \u2013 suggests. If the next 12 months run to script, GSK will have overcome a big patent cliff without cutting its dividend or resorting to big and risky purchases of drugs in development. The self-help strategy has also seen expansion into vaccines and consumer products. Those waters are less exciting than pharmaceuticals but relative dullness looks wiser with every passing month. Valeant, epitome of the new breed of deal-a-minute, price-hiking pharma firms, is currently imploding in spectacular fashion in the US. Its shareholders would love GSK\u2019s side helping of toothpaste and hard-to-manufacture vaccines that bring solid cash flows. That is why the view here remains the same: on current form, there is no need to break up GSK. Being a boring miner is best for Rio Succession is cleaner at Rio Tinto. Chief executive Sam Walsh is retiring to spend more time with his milk jugs (he collects the antique variety) and Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques, who runs the copper business, has been named as the new boss. Easy. Walsh\u2019s three-year spell has been a demonstration that digging holes in the ground is a simple business made complicated only by deal-doers. He has cut costs, avoided acquisitions and tried to make Rio boring again after the wild ride under predecessor Tom Albanese, who bet the balance sheet on a $38bn (\u00a326bn) cash takeover of aluminium producer Alcan at the top of a bull market and then compounded his error by buying coal mines in Mozambique. Rio has not avoided financial pain in the current commodity downturn. It has just cut its dividend. But, in a race where all share prices have gone backwards, Rio has outperformed all its main London-listed rivals in the past couple of years. One assumes chairman Jan du Plessis, in the seat since 2009, will ease the new chief executive into position and then look to make his own exit. When he does so, he should hand his own successor a copperplated instruction: never, ever listen to anybody who thinks they can read long-term commodity prices. To ditch RBS cheap would be a bad deal A detail from the Office for Budget Responsibilty is worth noting: its figures assume the government will sell the entire stake in Royal Bank of Scotland during this parliament. Four years is an age, but chancellor George Osborne would surely hope to shed the shares for a lot more than the current price of 231p. Indeed, the first small batch went at 330p last August.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Coca-Cola and other soft drinks companies targeted by George Osborne\u2019s sugar tax have warned that the chancellor\u2019s new levy will not reduce obesity. Analysts said prices were likely to rise for shoppers as a result of the tax, announced in a surprise budget measure on Wednesday, but suggested that the new tax could be hidden in smaller pack sizes or reduced discounts. The tax is set to launch in April 2018 and will put up the price of drinks which contain at least 5g of sugar per 100ml \u2013 such as Fanta, Sprite and Schweppes tonic. Drinks with 8g of sugar per 100ml or more \u2013 such as normal Coca-Cola, Red Bull, Irn-Bru and Lucozade Energy Original \u2013 will face a higher rate of tax. Coca-Cola\u2019s UK boss, Leendert den Hollander, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe the sugar tax is the right thing to be done. We are not debating the issue, we are debating the solution. The facts don\u2019t suggest that a sugar tax works to change behaviour. \u201cWe know this is one of the mechanics and solutions that people think will help deal with the issue of obesity, at least from a government perspective, but there is no evidence to suggest that this will reduce obesity.\u201d Marnie Millard, chief executive of Nichols, the maker of Vimto and Panda soft drinks, said: \u201cWhile we recognise sugar consumption is a shared responsibility, we do not believe that a tax on soft drinks is an effective solution or fair to consumers.\u201d Meanwhile, Britvic said in a statement: \u201cWe are extremely disappointed that the government is proposing to introduce a soft drinks tax from 2018. Singling out soft drinks alone will not solve the obesity problem, given the small proportion of calories they contribute in the average diet. \u201cWe remain of the view that only a holistic, wide-ranging strategy will tackle obesity.\u201d The Treasury has not yet decided how much more producers will have to charge for heavily sweetened drinks, but health campaigners want it to be 20%. That would be equivalent to about 40p on a 1.75l bottle of Coke or a more than 10p on a standard can of fizzy drink. James Brown, at pricing strategy specialists Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners, said: \u201cWe\u2019d expect much of this tax to be passed on to consumers through higher shelf prices, but also in hidden ways such as smaller pack sizes and lower promotional discounts.\u201d He said pubs, cafes and restaurants could be surprise losers from the tax as manufacturers might find the tax easier to pass on to those outlets than to supermarkets, where there are only a few big players who fight hard over price. Analysts at City broker Shore Capital suggested that a price rise of 6p to 8p per can could be enough to persuade shoppers to switch to a healthy alternative but that shoppers might also choose to switch from a brand, such as Coke, to unbranded equivalents. The announcement of the tax hit the stock-market value of soft drinks companies. Shares in AG Barr, the maker of Irn-Bru, were down 6% since Osborne spoke to parliament. Nichols has lost 7.5% while shares in Britvic, which makes and distributes Pepsi in the UK, are down 3.3% as investors fear that sales will suffer. More than 350 products sold by major retailers will be affected by the levy, according to Mysupermarket.co.uk, the price comparison site. It said more than half of those items, which include red can Coca-Cola, standard Pepsi and Red Bull, contain more than 8g of sugar per 100ml. However, heavily sweetened fruit juices and milk-based drinks will be excluded from the tax. One supermarket boss told the Guardian he was looking forward to the potential of reducing the amount of fizzy drinks on his shelves and replacing them with healthier options. But another said the tax was likely to have little impact on sales, given the unflagging popularity of other heavily taxed treats such as alcohol. City analysts believe sales are likely to be hit, but that the scale of the drop is difficult to assess until the government reveals the level of the tax. In France, where a soft drink tax amounted to about 2p per 330ml can, sales fell by about 3% in the first year but the impact reduced as shoppers got used to the new higher prices. In Mexico, when a 10% tax was imposed, sugary drink sales fell by 12% while bottled water sales soared. Nicola Mallard, a consumer industry analyst at Investec, said the threat of the tax would accelerate drinks companies\u2019 efforts to reduce sugar in their products. In the past four years there had been an average 11% reduction in calories from soft drinks, according to the British Soft Drink Association. \u201cThe levy will only be introduced in two years\u2019 time, with the clear intention that companies reformulate their products in the interim to reduce or eliminate exposure to the levy,\u201d she said. She said brands such as Pepsi, which contains 11g of sugar per 100ml, could reformulate to take them into the lower band of the tax but were unlikely to be able to remove sugar altogether. Citing the example of the tax in Mexico, Coca-Cola\u2019s Den Hollander said: \u201cIf the objective is to reduce calorie intake on a daily basis then the example in Mexico shows it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d He said Mexico\u2019s tax on sugar drinks, introduced in 2014, had only reduced average intake by six calories a day.",

      "bodyText": "Investors expect Sainsbury\u2019s to offer as much as \u00a31.5bn for Argos on Friday, as the supermarket considers trumping a rival South African bid for the catalogue shop ahead of a 5pm deadline. Sainsbury\u2019s and Steinhoff International have been set a timescale by the takeover panel to announce a firm intention to bid for Home Retail Group, the parent of Argos, or walk away. The panel clarified on Thursday that if one party revealed a firm intention to make an offer for Home Retail, then the other side would have 53 days to respond. City bankers were divided over whether there was an advantage or disadvantage in moving first in the highly unusual stand off in which both bidders are on the same timetable. If neither side is ready, Home Retail could potentially ask the panel for an extension. Both sides have spent several weeks looking over Home Retail\u2019s books and discussing their potential bids with the Argos owner\u2019s board. At present Steinhoff, which already owns Bensons for Beds, and Harveys in the UK, has the most attractive offer on the table with a cash bid of \u00a31.42bn, or 175p a share. But Sainsbury\u2019s cash and shares offer is currently worth only slightly less \u2013 173p a share \u2013 as its share price has risen more than 10% since Steinhoff first announced its rival offer for Home Retail last month. The supermarket this week bumped up its share price with the revelation of its first quarter of sales growth in more than two years. Home Retail\u2019s share price has risen to 181p, valuing the company at \u00a31.47bn, as investors bet that Sainsbury\u2019s will up its bid to at least that level. Richard Clarke, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said Sainsbury\u2019s was likely to put forward a new bid at around 185p a share \u2013 valuing Home Retail at just over \u00a31.5bn. The supermarket\u2019s fire power has been improved by the performance of its own shares and by Home Retail\u2019s revelation last week that it had generated \u00a3100m more cash reserves than expected in the past year. Sainsbury\u2019s sees the acquisition of Argos as a way to accelerate its attempts to tap into the fast growing online market. But the company has made clear that it is determined not to over pay for Argos and is under pressure from major shareholders not to splash out too much. Revealing Sainsbury\u2019s latest financial results on Tuesday, chief executive Mike Coupe said Argos was not a \u201cmust do deal\u201d. He added: \u201cThere\u2019s a price and we won\u2019t go beyond that. We\u2019ll maintain a level of financial discipline \u2026 There is no reason why Sainsbury\u2019s won\u2019t be a successful company in future without the Argos transaction taking place.\u201d Clarke said both sides would be seeking a recommendation from Home Retail\u2019s board, although Sainsbury\u2019s has made clear that it is willing to make a hostile bid if it cannot get agreement. \u201cThings could get more acrimonious,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cIt will be about who blinks first.\u201d One banker with long experience of takeover negotiations said that Steinhoff was unlikely to be the first to make a move as its bid was already the higher offer. \u201cHome Retail\u2019s board is likely to favour a cash offer and if it announces an agreed deal with Steinhoff I think it would be very difficult for Sainsbury\u2019s to come back,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Sainsbury\u2019s gets an agreed deal I think Steinhoff could counter. If I was Steinhoff I would not put my price up and wait and see what happens.\u201d But Steinhoff, which has an international retail empire, is currently working on a number of other deals. Some analysts believe Steinhoff may lose interest in Home Retail if the price gets too high as it also currently bidding for electrical goods retailer Darty in France and is also rumoured to be looking at Australian electronics chain The Good Guys. It is also backing the expansion of Pep &amp; Co, a new budget clothing chain being developed by Andy Bond, the former boss of UK supermarket chain Asda.",

Think about a scenario where every cent of your mortgage, credit card and university debt must be paid off. Then apply that debt elimination plan to the government sector \u2026 and then the corporate world. If debt is so evil, pernicious, and threatening something akin to a 1930s Great Depression, surely the answer is to pay off debt and have none. The debt debate has stooped to fresh lows in recent weeks, with a number of money managers and commentators joining the usual suspects to highlight the peril for the Australian economy of housing debt. A couple of years ago it was government debt that was the problem, but that scare faded as common sense prevailed, even though government debt has continued to grow at a steady pace. Let\u2019s stop there and think about debt. It goes without saying, or at least it should, that debt is a good thing for the household sector, governments and corporations. It is essential. It allows each segment of the economy to invest and bring forward spending that would otherwise not occur. I can\u2019t be sure of this but I would hazard a guess that every major infrastructure project in the world has been financed by debt and every business has had debt at some stage of its being. With no debt, think of a government taxing people for years to accumulate the funds to build a power station, hospital or to build roads. Absurd, isn\u2019t it? What about consumers buying a car, let alone a house? Not many people, particularly the young, have saved the cash needed to buy a house. So too for corporations who are dependent on debt to invest, expand, innovate and grow. And saving, don\u2019t forget, can\u2019t exist without debt because someone\u2019s savings are another person\u2019s debt. If I deposit $100 in a bank, the bank has debt of $100 to me. Which simply means that deposits cannot exist if there is no debt \u2013 they are opposites of the same balance sheet. Debt is not the problem. The problem, to the extent there may be one, is the regulations that apply to debt. If debt is sought and provided on the basis of robust due diligence \u2013 that there is no fraud and deception and that only creditworthy borrowers are forwarded the funds by creditworthy lenders \u2013 then it matters little whether debt is 10% of household income or 200% of income. Some people borrow six, seven or even eight times their income to buy a house, and it turns out to be a prudent decision. Others default on a $50-a-month debt linked to a mobile phone contract. It is only when too much money is carelessly lent to high-risk borrowers that problems unfold. This was the case in the lead into the banking crisis in 2008 when in the US, UK and other countries (not Australia) anyone on any income could get a mortgage. It wasn\u2019t debt that was the problem, but inept and foolhardy banking practices, financially ignorant borrowers who signed up for loans, and the regulators who let all this happen. Australia\u2019s banks, having seen the disasters of the US, Irish and UK banks in the crisis, have tightened their lending standards. In addition, regulators have tightened the rules for investor mortgage lending, albeit belatedly, but with an express objective of reducing the risk that the wrong people get access to debt. Provisions of bad debts and non-performing loans from the banks and other financial institutions remain at near-historic lows, meaning the health of the debt market, at least for householders, is sound. Which goes back to the starting point. Debt is an essential aspect of the economy, delivering growth, employment and rising living standards. The anti-debt campaigners seem to overlook this when they argue the perils of debt, not just in Australia but around the world.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Glencore\u2019s efforts to reduce fatalities among its staff have suffered a setback with the announcement that the death toll from an accident at a Congolese mine has risen to seven. Rescuers have been searching for survivors for 10 days, after the wall of an open pit mine owned by a Glencore subsidiary, Katanga, collapsed on employees performing upgrade work. It had previously reported three fatalities at the operation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), saying it would keep looking for four people who were unaccounted for. But the Switzerland-based business announced it had given up hope of finding anyone left alive. The accident takes the company\u2019s death toll so far this year to eight, compared with 10 in 2015, after an earlier accident in Kazakhstan. \u201cIt is with deep sadness that Glencore must now assume that any individual who was in KOV open pit at the time of the incident will not have survived,\u201d the company said in a statement. Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive, said: \u201cOn behalf of the board, we offer our deepest condolences to the families of the deceased individuals and our sincere thanks to the search-and-rescue team who have worked tirelessly over the past 10 days. We must reiterate that any loss of life at our operations is unacceptable and we will continue to work relentlessly to improve health and safety across the group.\u201d The London Mining Network, a charity concerned with the impact of mining, said the incident cast doubt on Glencore\u2019s efforts to improve safety. \u201cGlencore has a poor health and safety record, to go with the poor reputation it has earned for environmental and social issues,\u201d said its spokesman, Andrew Whitmore. \u201cThe company claims to be addressing this issue but it is difficult to see how health and safety has the highest priority in a company with the trading and profit-driven culture of Glencore,\u201d he added. The London-listed commodity company, which appears in many UK pension fund portfolios due to its place in the FTSE 100, has sought to address a fatality count that compares unfavourably to its competitors. Criticism of its record reached a peak when it reported 26 deaths in 2013, above the norm for major mining companies. It has since reduced the number of fatal accidents, reporting 16 in 2014 and 10 in 2015, thanks in part to a company-wide initiative called SafeWork. But the new incident, the first at Katanga for 16 months, means it could struggle to keep momentum towards its goal of zero fatalities. Operations at Katanga were suspended last autumn when the company responded to a slump in the copper price by ceasing production at mines in the mineral-rich \u201ccopperbelt\u201d stretching through Zambia and the DRC. The accident is understood to have happened when the north wall of the open pit mine collapsed during upgrade work during the shutdown. Glencore has previously pointed to repairs it has made at Katanga to improve safety after years of state control. A spokesman for Glencore said in 2009 that \u201cmore than $11m has been spent on reinforcing more than 1,900m of mine shaft roof and on completing mined-out production chamber support, following a thorough review of rock mechanics to improve safety\u201d. Glencore\u2019s safety record first came under scrutiny after its stock market flotation in 2011, during which it released a sustainability report saying that 56 people were killed working for the company between 2008 and 2010. BHP had lost 23 in the same period while Rio Tinto reported 32 in a four-year period. The latest tragedy to hit Glencore takes the death toll this year to eight and threatens to see it fall behind its competitors on safety. BHP Billiton, the world\u2019s largest miner, reported five deaths last year, while Anglo American suffered four and Rio Tinto six. Like other mining companies, Glencore wrestles with difficult conditions for miners, with economic slowdown in China resulting in rock-bottom prices for its product. The Switzerland-based company lost $4.9bn last year and its shares have slumped to 156.5p compared to their flotation price of 530p.",

      "bodyText": "Mortgage lending leapt by 30% in the 12 months to February to hit \u00a317.6bn, according to the latest figures from banks and building societies. Despite a 5% fall from January\u2019s figure, the Council of Mortgage Lenders reported strong year-on-year growth, after low mortgage rates and demand for homes fuelled lending. The \u00a317.6bn total compared with \u00a313.6bn in the same month of the previous year and was the highest lent in a February since 2008, when the downturn was starting to take hold. The CML\u2019s figures are for gross lending during the month and do not take into account repayments. Recent months have shown strong levels of remortgaging activity, as borrowers have taken advantage of fixed-rate mortgages at record lows. The CML\u2019s economist, Mohammad Jamei, said the annual rate of growth was in line with the figures for the closing months of 2015. \u201cThe recovery is being underpinned by market fundamentals in the UK, as wages grow and unemployment falls, helped by government schemes and competitive mortgage deals,\u201d he said. The change to stamp duty rates on second homes, which comes into effect on 1 April, led to a 40% rise in buy-to-let loans for house purchase in January, and it is likely that this boost continued into February. However, Jamei said he did not think the figures pointed to a significant acceleration in lending. \u201cWhile there may be a slight current boost to lending as some transactions seek to complete before the 1 April tax changes in the buy-to-let-sector, this is likely to be followed by a slight fall in activity,\u201d he said. \u201cAffordability pressures continue to weigh on activity, as does the low number of properties coming on the market, though this has been improving very recently.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s budget has confirmed that all property investors will face an extra stamp duty bill if they buy homes after 1 April. The rates on additional homes will be three percentage points above the standard stamp duty rates, which will add \u00a36,000 to the upfront cost of investing in a \u00a3200,000 property. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said lending was likely to have been boosted by both remortgaging and purchases. \u201cHousing market activity is seemingly getting some boost at the moment from increased activity from buy-to-let and second home purchases ahead of April\u2019s rise in stamp duty,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could exert limited upward pressure on house prices in the near term. Post April, a likely waning of buy-to-let interest may modestly dilute housing market activity and ease upward pressure on prices.\u201d The main house price indices show the cost of buying a home has risen more quickly than earnings over the past year, and Jeremy Duncombe, director of Legal and General Mortgage Club, which works with advisers and lenders, said buyers were being forced to take out larger loans to cope with increasing house prices. \u201cThese high prices combined with a lack of affordable housing puts owning a property out of reach for many first time buyers. Initiatives that can aid the delivery of the 250,000 extra homes needed annually should be thoroughly explored by the government, with all options considered.\u201d he said. \u201cAs the chancellor himself conceded in his budget, more needs to be done to speed up the realisation of these new properties if the housing market and the wider economy is to return to full health.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "After a volatile day, the London stock market has closed higher tonight thanks to a surge in natural resource companies. Silver produced Fresnillo, mining giant Antofagasta and commodity trading group Glencore all surged almost 10% today. They were following a pick-up in the prices of metals, thanks to the weaker dollar which remains on track for its worst day against the British pound since 2009. So the FTSE finished 25 points higher, at 6,201 points. Chris Beauchamp of IG says miners saved the day: Were it not for the mining sector, the FTSE 100 would be firmly in the red, but with commodity prices looking perkier thanks to a weaker dollar, the index has been able to hold close to its recent peak around 6200. European markets have finisher in the red, with the French CAC losing 0.5% and German DAX down almost 1%. That\u2019s partly due to alarm over the strength of the euro against the US dollar tonight. The oil price is also pushing higher, with US crude hitting a three-month high tonight. Traders will have plenty to chew on as they travel home, particularly about central banker. Last night\u2019s Fed announcements set the scene for a day in which two central banks cut interest rates (Norway and Indonesia), while two more held rates steady but issued gloomy statements (Switzerland and the UK). Can central banks really keep bailing us out? Or as Justin Trudeau point out, isn\u2019t it really time for fiscal policy to do more?..... On that note, thanks for reading and goodnight. Amid choppy trading in New York, the Dow Jones index has quietly hit its highest level of the year. The Dow is currently up 93 points, or 0.5%, at 17,418, as traders ponder the implications of the Fed\u2019s new gloomy view of the global economy and the financial markets. The pound is on track for its biggest one-day jump against the US dollar since October 2009, according to Reuters data. Sterling is currently up 1.7%, or 2.4 cents, at $1.4494 , thanks to the Fed\u2019s sudden dovishness last night. Ever felt like you\u2019re languishing in the wrong job, toiling away at the coalface as your glittering talents go to waste? Me neither. But according to the UK stats office, one in three workers are either over or under-qualified for their roles. As Katie Allen explains, it\u2019s not a great sign: In another blow to hopes that the UK can lift its productivity growth out of the doldrums, data from the Office for National Statistics shows the proportion of workers \u201cmatched\u201d to their job has dropped in recent years. At 68.7% in the three months to December 2015, the percentage of those in employment with a level of education close to the average of their job was down compared with 69.9% two years earlier. Here\u2019s the full story: Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau, has flashed his Keynesian credentials today. Speaking to Bloomberg, the newly-ish elected leader said that Canada can\u2019t simply rely on central bankers for growth. Fiscal measures must do their bit too, Trudeau insisted, saying: \u201cWe should be using fiscal levers a little more and not just expecting monetary policy to have to fix the challenge we\u2019re in. \u201cI think we\u2019re approaching the limit of the impact of monetary policy alone.\u201d Canada\u2019s government is due to present a budget next week, and analysts expect they will lay out plans for a larger deficit. During the interview, Trudeau also diplomatically suggested he could work with Republican front-runner (and global threat-in-waiting) Donald Trump. The fall in the dollar is helping to push the oil and gold prices higher. Brent crude has gained 1.6% so far today, to $41 per barrel. As usual, there\u2019s chatter about a possible agreement to freeze output; producers are due to meet in April. Gold is also enjoying a little romp, up 0.3% to $1,266 per ounce, having surged by 3% yesterday when the Fed decision was announced. The Economist Intelligence Unit is sticking to its forecast that UK interest rates will remain at record lows for another four years. Art Cashin, a legendary figure on Wall Street, reckons the Federal Reserve is still too hawkish about monetary policy when it predicts two rate rises this year. Cashin, UBS\u2019s director of floor operations at the New York stock exchange, told CNBC that Janet Yellen will be lucky to manage one hike before Christmas. (That\u2019s a St Patrick\u2019s Day hat) The US dollar continues to be thumped today, and has shed more than 1% against other currencies. The greenback continues to suffer from last night\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, when the Fed said it will probably only raise interest rates twice this year, not four times. It has tumbled by almost two cents against the British pound, sending sterling up to $1.4452. And the euro is almost one cent higher, at $1.1316. Christopher Vecchio, Currency Analyst at DailyFX, says traders are racing to get out of the US dollar. The US Dollar may still be the greenback, but it\u2019s green in the face now that the Fed has all but stamped out the \u201cdivergence trade\u201d that\u2019s carried the world\u2019s reserve currency for the past two years. \u201cInstead, no matter where you turn, US Dollar charts are \u2018puking\u2019 - most everyone was on one side of the trade, and now everyone is rushing for the exits at the same time.\u201d \u2018Puking\u2019, in City jargon, occurs when an asset plunges rapidly, as seen in this chart of the dollar against other currencies today South Africa has bucked the trend and raised interest rates, by a quarter-point to 7%. Worries about the global economy are likely to weigh the New York stock market when trading begins, in 30 minutes time. Reuters explains: Wall Street was set for a lower open onThursday, a day after the Federal Reserve\u2019s lowered expectations of two interest rate hikes in 2016 pushed the S&amp;P 500 to its highest close this year. The Fed, which left rates unchanged, pointed to moderateU.S. economic growth and strong job gains but cautioned about risks from an uncertain global economy. While markets across assets cheered the move, the central bank\u2019s dovish tone raised some concern about the prospects of the weakness in the global economy impacting the U.S. economy. \u201cThere\u2019s this little bit of rethinking and so, we\u2019re looking at a softer opening as some questions arise to the prospects of future growth impacting earnings,\u201d said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. And here\u2019s IG\u2019s latest opening calls: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, believes UK interest rates will remain at record lows for at least another year. He cites weak demand in the eurozone, and weakness in the UK economy too: \u201cThe prospect of a hike in the Bank Rate remains one for the dim and distant future. The euro-zone - the UK\u2019s single largest source of imports - fell into deflation in February. Moreover, a backdrop of further falls in factory gate prices, subdued wage growth, and February seeing cuts in gas bills, also points to UK inflation rising very modestly this year. In addition, the Chancellor\u2019s Budget plans imply a slightly more severe fiscal squeeze over the next five years than previously planned, which should further caution the MPC against a tighter policy.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s Bank of England announcement: Back to the Bank of England..... and today\u2019s minutes show that the MPC is concerned about the global economy. They say: Over the medium term, growth in the advanced economies should continue to be supported by the boost to real incomes from low commodity prices, and to some degree by fiscal and monetary policy. But emerging market economies are likely to grow more slowly than in recent years and the risks to the MPC\u2019s central projection of only modest global growth lie to the downside. There\u2019s drama in the financial markets -- the Bank of Japan appears to have intervened to weaken the yen. The BoJ would have been unhappy to see the yen appreciate sharply against the US dollar today, after America\u2019s Federal Reserve was so dovish last night. Financial traders are continuing to protect themselves against sterling plunging around June\u2019s referendum, the Bank of England says. Options prices continued to indicate that the price of protection against the risk of a sterling depreciation against the dollar compared with the price of protection against an appreciation was higher than in the second half of 2015. That negative skew had increased over the period since the Committee\u2019s previous meeting. However, there is \u201clittle evidence\u201d that other UK asset prices have been hurt by Brexit fears, the minutes say. The Bank of England has warned that rising Brexit uncertainty could hit economic demand in the UK. In the minutes of today\u2019s monetary policy meeting, it says that the issue has already weakened the pound. There appears to be increased uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming referendum on UK membership of the European Union. That uncertainty is likely to have been a significant driver of the decline in sterling [which has fallen by 9% since last November]. It may also delay some spending decisions and depress growth of aggregate demand in the near term. On the upside, though, the Bank believes that the underlying growth of private domestic demand remains solid. A tighter labour market and rising productivity are expected to support real incomes and consumption. Consumer confidence and most surveys of business investment are above historical averages. Breaking! Britain has entered its eighth year of record low interest rates. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee has voted unanimously to leave borrowing costs at their current record low of 0.5%, extending a run dating back to March 2009. The MPC also voted 9-0 to leave the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme unchanged, at \u00a3375bn. Details and reaction to follow.... With Donald Trump tightening his grip on the Republican nomination, the Economist Intelligence Unit has warned that President Trump would be a serious threat to the global economy. As serious, indeed, as a resurgence of jihadi terrorism destabilising the global economy. In a new report, the EIU argues that if Trump wins November\u2019s presidential election, he would trigger a trade war and incite fresh turmoil in the Middle East Brexit, Grexit, a Chinese hard-landing and fresh conflict between Russia and Eastern Europe are also significant threats, they say: New data has confirmed that the eurozone has fallen back into negative inflation. Eurostat reports that prices dropped by 0.2% across the single currency bloc in February, in line with its earlier flash estimate, and justifying the stimulus measures announced by the European Central Bank last week And there are now 11 eurozone countries in deflation, up from six in January, as cheap oil pulls down energy costs. Howard Archer IHS Global Insight says: Renewed members of the deflation club in February included Germany, France and Italy. Furthermore, Spanish deflation widened markedly to 1.0% from 0.4% in January.... He believes price pressures will remain weak for some months. The Eurozone may well edge in and out of deflation in the near term, before consumer prices gradually edge up due to reduced year-on-year drops in energy prices helped by base effects, the weak euro and ongoing Eurozone growth. Please don\u2019t get excited if you receive a message from the Bank of England governor, offering you millions of dollars. It\u2019s a fraud, despite the \u2018ID Card\u2019 offered as proof that it really, really is Mark Carney (it really isn\u2019t) The Bank of England are on the case: Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says City traders are nervous ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s big announcement in an hour\u2019s time. While rates will surely remain at 0.5%, the minutes of this month\u2019s meeting could add to the pessimistic mood, he says. With the BoE due to release its latest monetary policy outlook, fundamental risk remains at the forefront of trader\u2019s minds, despite little likeliness of any policy shift. Given yet another OBR growth downgrade yesterday, the chances of a rate hike are slim to none, as reflected by the fact that the rates market currently sees a cut as more likely than the much vaunted hike. Indonesia just followed Norway by cutting interest rates. In its case, from 7% to 6.75%. The early optimism in the stock markets is fizzling out, following this morning\u2019s double-dose of central bank gloom. The major European indices are all now in the red, after the pessimistic statements from the Swiss and Norwegian central banks earlier today. They have reignited concerns over weak global growth, and worries that central bankers may be ill-equipped to handle it. Shares in French and German exporters are being hit, following this morning\u2019s rise in the value of the euro against the US dollar (making their goods less competitive). Erica Blomgre of Nordic corporate bank SEB says the Norwegian central bank was more pessimistic than expected today, as it lowered interest rates and predicted further cuts ahead. \u201cThe new rate path is more dovish than what market was pricing ahead of the meeting.... The main reason for the lower path is weaker private and foreign demand, lower rates abroad and lower wages and prices.\u201d Newsflash: Norway\u2019s central bank has just cut interest rates from 0.75% to 0.5%, and issued its own warning about the economic outlook. Governor \u00d8ystein Olsen says: Growth prospects for the Norwegian economy have weakened somewhat and inflation is expected to moderate further out. The Board has therefore decided to lower the key policy rate. And with wage growth weak, and unemployment expected to rise, Olsen says that rates could be cut again: \u201cThe current outlook for the Norwegian economy suggests that the key policy rate may be reduced further in the course of the year.\u201d The Nordes Bank even hints that it could even cut interest rates below zero! Should the Norwegian economy be exposed to new major shocks, the Executive Board will not exclude the possibility that the key policy rate may turn negative. More central bank action, this time in Switzerland. The Swiss National Bank has just left interest rates unchanged at minus 0.75%, and warned that the country faces deeper negative inflation too. The SNB also struck a downbeat tone, saying: The global economic outlook has deteriorated slightly in recent months and the situation on international financial markets remains volatile. The Fed\u2019s sudden dovishness could yet backfire if they are caught out by US inflation pressures, says Jan Von Gerich of Nordea Markets. Mike van Dulken and Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets reckon that the Federal Reserve might not raise interest rates at all this year. They suspect that the looming US election could help keep borrowing costs on hold through 2016 (even though policymakers expect two rate hikes). The Fed chair cited global risks to the US economy and inflation uncertainty, rather than the US economy itself which is performing well, as reasons for a) standing pat in March and b) just maybe standing pat for the rest of the year. We still think (b) is the most likely outcome given what\u2019s on the menu in the US in the latter half of 2016 (i.e. a presidential election the build-up to which is proving even more of a circus than usual), not to mention that the FOMC needs to keep market sentiment in check. The dollar is continuing to weaken this morning, driving the euro up to a five-week high of $1.1279. The pound has also risen against the US dollar, to $1.429. Brexit fears are taking a back seat today. And India\u2019s rupee has also strengthened: Mining companies are leading the rally in London this morning, with Anglo American surging by almost 10%. They are benefitting from the slump in the US dollar, after the Fed said it only expects two interest rate hikes this year, not four. A weaker US currency pushes up the cost of commodities (as they are priced in dollars), and should also prevent capital from pouring out of emerging markets into US assets. Shares are rallying in Europe, and across Asia, after the US Federal Reserve was surprisingly dovish at last night\u2019s policy meeting. America\u2019s central bank tore up its previous forecasts for four interest rate rises this year, and now expects to only hike American borrowing costs twice in 2016. That\u2019s a recognition that inflationary pressures are rather weaker than policymakers previously realised. The Fed struck a somewhat downbeat tone, given it had hiked borrowing costs back in December, cautioning that \u201cglobal economic and financial developments continue to pose risks\u201d. And chair Janet Yellen was at pains to insists that monetary wasn\u2019t on a pre-set course, and that \u201ccaution\u201d was needed. This dovish approach to rate hikes was cheered on Wall Street, and Asian markets followed suit. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite index has closed 1.2% higher, and Australia gained almost 1%. And in London, the FTSE 100 has gained 33 points in early trading to 6210 points. Investors are calculating that the era of ultra-easy monetary policy could be with us for longer than expected, with Japan and the eurozone now operating negative interest rates and British borrowing costs likely to stay low for many years. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s era of record low interest rates will continue into its eighth year today, as the Bank of England meets to set monetary policy. In a busy period for central bankers, it\u2019s the BoE\u2019s turn to consider how to tackle the weak growth and low inflation that is bedevilling the global economy. At noon today the monetary policy committee will announce their decisions, and almost certainly leave interest rates at 0.5%. The minutes of the meeting will be more interesting, showing how worried policymakers are the global economy, the recent turbulence in the financial markets, and even the upcoming EU referendum. And there\u2019s always the possibility that one, or more, of the nine MPC members will vote to change monetary policy today. It\u2019s unlikely, though, as Jasper Lawler of CMC Market explains: Expectations are for another 0-0-9 vote to keep interest rates unchanged. It\u2019s hard to imagine accompanying BOE meeting minutes turning more hawkish before the June Brexit vote given Governor Mark Carney\u2019s warnings about the risks of uncertainty. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Ted Baker has reported a 20% rise in annual profits, with further international expansion plans boosted by well received spring and summer ranges. The British clothing chain, which has 448 stores and concessions worldwide, has been outperforming many rivals and is pushing ahead with a raft of overseas store openings. The company was one of the few high-street retailers to report strong sales over Christmas. The firm, known for quirky fashion details, said the initial reaction to its spring and summer collections had been positive. It is tapping into the growing activewear market with a new range of premium sportswear for women, Fit to a T, featuring flowery designs. Ray Kelvin, founder and chief executive, said: \u201cWe have again traded very well \u2013 despite an uncertain backdrop in some of our markets \u2013 which is testament to the strength of the Ted Baker brand as well as our unwavering focus on quality, design and attention to detail.\u201d Current trading is in line with its expectations, apart from in Asia where demand has slumped. Asia is a small part of the Ted Baker business, making up 3.4% of revenues, and it still sees long-term potential in the region despite its current economic malaise. Rebecca Marks, analyst at the consultancy Verdict Retail, said: \u201cOn track to establish itself as a global lifestyle brand, Ted Baker accelerated its international expansion during the year, with investment in brand-building in newer markets paying off. A strong performance in North America demonstrates the brand\u2019s growing recognition.\u201d The company made a profit before tax of \u00a358.7m for the year to 30 January. Retail sales rose 13.5% to \u00a3348.4m, with UK and European sales up 8.9% to \u00a3252.5m while the US and Canada contributed \u00a380.6m, up 27.3%. Online sales were up 45.8% to \u00a353.5m. The wholesale division posted 33.6% growth to \u00a3107.7m. Womenswear, which makes up 55% of sales, was up 15.9% but menswear was the better performer, with 20.1% sales growth. Marks said Ted Baker responded to its typical 25 to 45-year-old male shoppers\u2019 growing demands for increased choice and style, with its quality collections justifying the high price tags. This year the retailer plans to open a new store in Paris, five outlets across north America and further concessions in France, Germany, Spain, China and Japan. In the past year it opened its first shops in Amsterdam, Azerbaijan, Hawaii, Mexico and Qatar. The company has also invested in a new European distribution centre in Derby which will be fully operational by the middle of next year and employ 250 people. Ted Baker has grown from a Glasgow shirt shop, set up by Kelvin in 1988, to a global fashion brand that also sells jewellery, perfume, luggage, rugs and tiles, with stores from Beijing to Boston. The FTSE 250 company raised its annual dividend by 18.6% to 47.8p a share. \u201cThe Ted Baker brand is unique,\u201d said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Freddie George. \u201cIt remains clearly differentiated from peers and is beginning to gain momentum from a global perspective. It is very much in the early stages of an international roll-out strategy, particularly in Europe.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "One in three UK workers are in the wrong job, ONS figures claim", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Almost one in three workers are either overqualified or underqualified for their jobs, according to new figures that deal a fresh blow to hopes that the UK can lift its productivity growth out of the doldrums. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows the proportion of workers \u201cmatched\u201d to their job has dropped steadily in recent years. In the three months to December, the percentage of those in employment with a level of education close to the average level of learning for their job was the lowest for more than a decade \u2013 at 68.7%. The ONS said one in six workers were overeducated, echoing other reports that skills are being wasted in UK workplaces. Previous figures from the ONS have highlighted the proportion of university graduates in non-degree level work such as bar-tending. The latest news is not what the chancellor, George Osborne, will want to hear after independent forecasters cut the prospects for productivity growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility said that the gloomier economic outlook coupled with a shaky global economy meant UK growth would be 2% this year, down from its previous forecast of 2.4%. The latest ONS figures showed a rise in the proportion of people overeducated for their job to 16.1%, up from 15.3% two years earlier. The proportion of people undereducated for their job, also a potential blow to productivity, rose to 15.1% from 14.8%. Labour-market experts said the data should push policymakers, education providers and employers to take the UK\u2019s skills problems more seriously. \u201cWhilst any well-functioning labour market will have some degree of mismatch between skills and jobs, the persistent skills shortages in sectors such IT and engineering suggest that there are some structural problems in the labour market,\u201d said Steve Hill at The Open University. Hill, who works with employers to help design training programmes, said there should be more such collaborations to ensure colleges, schools and universities give students the skills the economy really needs. Labour-market expert John Philpott said the growing trend in underuse of talent should feature more highly in the post-budget debate on poor productivity growth. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from these estimates that the UK is underusing a lot of talent, with women and people in part-time jobs in particular employed in occupations for which they are overeducated,\u201d said Philpott, director of the consultancy The Jobs Economist. \u201cWhile such a waste of available skill was understandable during the recession the generally upward trend toward increased overeducation since 2012 is worrying.\u201d But there was also evidence that where workers are overqualified for jobs, the surplus education contributes to enhanced productivity, said Geraint Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University Management School. \u201cWorkers who are overqualified for their jobs earn, on average, more than other workers in similar jobs.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has kept the UK base interest rate at its historic low of 0.5% despite a steep fall in the value of sterling linked to the EU referendum, which policymakers said was likely to exert upward pressure on inflation. The BoE said disappointing business investment and the weaker outlook for global trade would offset the impact of a cheaper pound and keep inflation in check in the short term before a rise to its 2% target within the next two years. The Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) also unanimously voted to keep its quantitative easing asset purchase scheme on hold at \u00a3375bn in response to a mixed bag of indicators that it said would keep GDP growth on an upward, though subdued path. The decision on Thursday means the UK is now in its eighth year of historic low interest rates. Wading into the EU referendum debate, the MPC blamed a near 10% fall in sterling since mid-November on uncertainty surrounding the expected referendum vote on 23 June. But it said there were few other signs that the decision to hold a referendum had altered the outlook for growth and inflation. \u201cThere appears to be increased uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming referendum on UK membership of the European Union. That uncertainty is likely to have been a significant driver of the decline in sterling. It may also delay some spending decisions and depress growth in aggregate demand in the near term. Overall, however, the committee judges that the outlook for domestic activity to be little changed from the time of the February inflation report,\u201d the MPC said. A fall in sterling increases the cost of imported goods, which form a large part of the inflation index. James Knightley, UK economist at ING Financial Markets, said the minutes of the Bank\u2019s March meeting showed policymakers were alive to the risks of Brexit. \u201cThe BoE acknowledge that the Brexit vote has weighed on sterling and may also delay some spending decisions and depress growth of aggregate demand in the near term. This is nothing more than stating the obvious, but it could be the first step into what could become a more concerted campaign to highlight the economic risks,\u201d he said. The BoE governor, Mark Carney, has come under pressure recently to follow other central banks that have cut interest rates further and boosted QE to stimulate lacklustre growth. The Bank of Japan recently cut its main deposit rate to negative to discourage saving and promote investment, following similar moves by the European Central Bank. Carney has ruled out adopting negative interest rates, though he has said he could cut rates from the current 0.5% and increase QE if it was deemed necessary. The MPC said growth in the current quarter was likely to follow the same path as the last quarter of 2015, which recorded an expansion in income of 0.5%. Several economists have voiced concerns that monetary policy has lost its potency and is unlikely to prevent a slide in global growth this year. Carney is among several central bankers to urge politicians to use the state\u2019s financial muscle to boost investment and growth rather than rely on monetary policy. The MPC said wages would begin to rise towards 3.5% to 4% as inflation increased towards the 2% target, maintaining its view that the economy will reassert the pattern seen before the 2008 crash. It maintained that recent weakness in wages would be temporary, contradicting analysis by the Resolution Foundation that forecasts a rise in median wages of just 1% over the next four to five years. Chris Williamson, the chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said the UK was suffering a more severe downturn in growth than expected at the start of the year and the Bank may be forced to act. \u201cWhile the Bank stressed that rates are more likely to rise than fall over the next two years, the nagging fear amongst policymakers is that there\u2019s little scope to use conventional rate cuts if the economy enters a new recession, and doubts hang over the effectiveness of further quantitative easing. \u201cIt\u2019s therefore a major concern that the deterioration in the PMI has already pushed the surveys into territory which has in the past seen the Bank of England see the need to inject more stimulus into the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chances of the Bank having to resort to further new non-standard measures to boost the economy have therefore increased considerably in recent weeks, as rising uncertainty regarding \u2018Brexit\u2019 has compounded wider concerns about the outlook for domestic and overseas demand.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest season of House of Cards got a lot of things right except (small spoiler alert) the price of gas. Francis Underwood, our sociopathic slimeball in chief, is facing an economic crisis thanks to sky-high gas prices. In the real world gas prices haven\u2019t been this low for close to a decade. In January there was a station in Ohio pumping gas at $1.20 a gallon. And yet, just as in Underwood\u2019s world, fear spurred by economic uncertainty roils the land. Gasoline prices are now more than 20% below where they were a year ago, leaving a lot more cash in the pockets of most Americans. In times gone by, lower gas prices seemed all that was required for a mini-flurry of optimism to take hold, in both the economy and the stock market. But not this year \u2013 not by a long shot. So why aren\u2019t we any happier? Wow, where to start? First of all, some consumers are starting to worry that those gas price declines might prove ephemeral. Indeed, after gasoline hit seven-year lows of less than $2 a gallon nationwide over the winter, prices are already creeping higher. But if drivers are paying more to fill up their tanks, it isn\u2019t because the muted rally in crude oil prices is propelling gasoline prices dramatically higher. Instead, the culprit is more mundane: a normal seasonal imbalance between supply and demand. When spring arrives, people tend to begin driving more, while refineries begin maintenance on their facilities ahead of the \u201csummer driving season\u201d \u2013 voil\u00e0, a recipe for higher prices, and anxiety on the part of drivers. Not that we were all that confident about the ability of lower gasoline to make a real difference to our household budgets anyway, it seems. The Commerce Department reported that retail sales fell 0.1% in February, and revised a previously reported gain of 0.2% in January into a 0.4% decline, just as gasoline prices were hitting their seven-year lows. Defying all historical trends and economists\u2019 most confident predictions, consumers stubbornly refused to remove their cash and credit cards from their wallets; apparently those remarkable savings on gasoline weren\u2019t enough to make them want to go on a spree at the mall and buoy the economy. In fact, Americans seem to be downright grumpy these days, cheap gasoline notwithstanding. We seem to have opted for a new mantra: don\u2019t be happy; worry. Perhaps it\u2019s because much of the time, it feels as if the only good news out there is the price they see when they pull up at a gas station to refill their car\u2019s gas tank. Sure, the stock market is doing better right now. But how long will that last? Morgan Stanley\u2019s strategists have just published a report arguing that there is nothing to suggest that it will, and arguing that the risk of a global recession is rising. Then there\u2019s the job market. Yes, of course, the headline numbers look good, with the unemployment rate holding at 4.9%, its lowest level since the financial crisis and the Great Recession that followed. But those figures obscure the real problem: that millions of Americans will probably never recover from those years, and the trends in wages that already had begun to manifest themselves even before that point. Since the recession, the percentage of the long-term unemployed has remained significant, and wages remain stagnant. Exacerbating it all is the fact that many Americans have less time to turn their financial situation around. The storm struck when we were in our 40s, 50s or 60s, and wreaked havoc on the value of our homes, our retirement portfolios and, in some cases, cost us our jobs. Millennials, meanwhile, are still struggling to find jobs and pay down astronomically high college loans. Saving a few bucks on gasoline bills just isn\u2019t enough. All that anger has fuelled \u2013 pun intended \u2013 the most heated election any of us has ever seen. And sadly the truth is most Americans are likely to find that their finances remain difficult, regardless of who moves into the White House in November. There will be no quick fix to the country\u2019s economic problems, and the economy and financial markets conceivably could face a lot of hurdles down the road, depending on what policies are implemented and how. Walking away from trade deals and shutting down immigration sounds great to many, until you realize that legal immigrants help keep many Silicon Valley companies moving and growing and creating US jobs, and that without trade deals, we\u2019d end up paying much higher prices for everything from cotton T-shirts to flat-screen TVs. Ditching Obamacare would have dramatic consequences, as would breaking up big banks. But there\u2019s actually some good news buried among all this doom and gloom, believe it or not. There\u2019s a saying on Wall Street that markets tend to climb a \u201cwall of worry\u201d. In other words, financial markets tend to stage stealthy rallies precisely when everyone is caught up in large-scale anxiety attacks of precisely this kind, unable to see any glimpse of sunlight at the end of the tunnel at all. They start looking at big-picture data, like that suggesting that the companies in the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500-stock index will see a dip in profitability for the fourth quarter of last year by the time they finish reporting their earnings, and that this is a sign of \u2013 gasp \u2013 a looming recession. Well, yes, it might be \u2013 if it weren\u2019t for the fact that the profits problem is solely due to the companies in the oil and gas industry, and that if you count out those businesses (which are only 6% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 anyway!) then profits actually jumped during the quarter. In other words, there are a lot of people out there wearing grey-tinted glasses right now. Which, if you haven\u2019t put any money into your 401(k) plan or your IRA yet for the year, makes me wonder whether this might not be a time to go ahead and do just that, especially if you\u2019re investing for the long haul and won\u2019t need those funds for years to come. It\u2019s when everything is priced for perfection that you need to start wondering what unexploded mine you\u2019re about to step on and detonate. In times like this, on the other hand, when everyone is grumpy and not even a seven-year low in the price of gasoline can bring a smile to their lips, the buying opportunities tend to be richer. The biggest example of all, of course, dates back exactly seven years, to the date that the selloff following the financial crisis ended, and ignited the biggest 12-month rally seen in decades, a period in which the S&amp;P 500 soared 90%.",

    "webTitle": "GSK chief Andrew Witty to leave drugmaker", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, is to leave the drugmaker next March after collecting a \u00a36.7m pay package last year. GSK said it had started looking for a successor to the 51-year-old, who joined the company in 1985 from university and has been at the helm since 2008. The company\u2019s annual report (PDF) showed his total pay and shares package rose to \u00a36.66m last year, from \u00a33.9m in 2014. Performance-based pay made up three-quarters of the 2015 remuneration, including an annual bonus of \u00a32.2m, part of which was deferred, and \u00a32.6m from a performance share plan. His salary stayed at just under \u00a31.1m. Moncef Slaoui, chairman of GSK global vaccines, an important part of the business, was the second-best-paid executive with a total package of \u00a35.2m, up from \u00a33m, while Simon Dingemans, the chief financial officer, saw his increase to \u00a33.2m, from \u00a31.9m. Witty has come under pressure to hasten GSK\u2019s turnaround following sliding profits in recent years. Last month, he fended off calls for a break up of the pharmaceuticals, vaccines and toothpaste multinational. He reiterated on Thursday that the company would return to core earnings growth this year, following a 15% decline last year. Richard Parkes, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: \u201cThe decision will allow him to step aside at a high point following the company\u2019s expected return to double digit earnings growth in 2016. We continue to be confident the company will meet or exceed these near-term targets driven by delivery on acquisition synergies and strong performance of its HIV business.\u201d He said Witty\u2019s departure raised two main questions, regarding the dividend and a potential spinout of the consumer division. \u201cAs a reminder GSK has committed to maintaining its dividend out to 2017 and any change to this seems highly unlikely. However, longer term we see it as possible that a new CEO prioritises M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions] to bolster its pharma business putting the dividend at risk longer term. While this could be funded by a sale or spin out of consumer, we view this as unlikely as it would leave any new CEO more exposed to the pharma division\u2019s weak pipeline unless a transformational deal was tied to this.\u201d Witty\u2019s reputation was damaged by a corruption scandal in China, which resulted in a \u00a3300m fine. He took action to clean up the company\u2019s act. GSK became the first drugmaker to stop payments to doctors to speak on its behalf and to scrap bonus payments tied to prescriptions. Another bribery scandal in the US, dating back to 2000, led to a record $3bn (\u00a32.1bn) fine for GSK in 2012. Just last month it was accused of cheating the NHS and fined \u00a337.6m over the cost of anti-depressants, but GSK disputed the ruling and said it actually saved the taxpayer money. However, Witty will also be remembered for the three-part, $20bn deal with Swiss rival Novartis in 2014 to pool consumer healthcare assets and exchange their oncology and vaccine businesses, which was hailed as an innovative deal in the industry. He said: \u201cBy next year, I will have been CEO for nearly 10 years and I believe this will be the right time for a new leader to take over. In making this decision it has been important to me that the board have the time to conduct a full and proper process and that we sustain the momentum of our current business performance.\u201d GSK\u2019s chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, paid tribute to him, saying: \u201cAndrew\u2019s retirement next year will represent the culmination of 32 years of service and leadership to GSK and the industry.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, is to leave the drugmaker next March after collecting a \u00a36.7m pay package last year. </p> <p>GSK said it had started looking for a successor to the 51-year-old, who joined the company in 1985 from university and has been at the helm since 2008.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gsk.com/media/1017500/annual-report-2015.pdf\">The company\u2019s annual report (PDF)</a> showed his total pay and shares package rose to \u00a36.66m last year, from \u00a33.9m in 2014. Performance-based pay made up three-quarters of the 2015 remuneration, including an annual bonus of \u00a32.2m, part of which was deferred, and \u00a32.6m from a performance share plan. His salary stayed at just under \u00a31.1m.</p> <p>Moncef Slaoui, chairman of GSK global vaccines, an important part of the business, was the second-best-paid executive with a total package of \u00a35.2m, up from \u00a33m, while Simon Dingemans, the chief financial officer, saw his increase to \u00a33.2m, from \u00a31.9m.</p> <p>Witty has come <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/feb/03/glaxosmithkline-sales-2015-sir-andrew-witty-resist-calls-breakup-company\">under pressure to hasten GSK\u2019s turnaround</a> following sliding profits in recent years. Last month, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/03/britain-better-inside-eu-says-glaxosmithkline-andrew-witty\">he fended off calls for a break up</a> of the pharmaceuticals, vaccines and toothpaste multinational. He reiterated on Thursday that the company would return to core earnings growth this year, following a 15% decline last year.</p> <p>Richard Parkes, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: \u201cThe decision will allow him to step aside at a high point following the company\u2019s expected return to double digit earnings growth in 2016. We continue to be confident the company will meet or exceed these near-term targets driven by delivery on acquisition synergies and strong performance of its HIV business.\u201d</p> <p>He said Witty\u2019s departure raised two main questions, regarding the dividend and a potential spinout of the consumer division. </p> <p>\u201cAs a reminder GSK has committed to maintaining its dividend out to 2017 and any change to this seems highly unlikely. However, longer term we see it as possible that a new CEO prioritises M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions] to bolster its pharma business putting the dividend at risk longer term. While this could be funded by a sale or spin out of consumer, we view this as unlikely as it would leave any new CEO more exposed to the pharma division\u2019s weak pipeline unless a transformational deal was tied to this.\u201d</p> <p>Witty\u2019s reputation was damaged by a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/19/glaxosmithkline-pays-297m-fine-china-bribery\">corruption scandal in China</a>, which resulted in a \u00a3300m fine. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/29/glaxosmithkline-ceo-business-stabilising-despite-china-slowdown\">He took action to clean up the company\u2019s act</a>. GSK became the first drugmaker to stop payments to doctors to speak on its behalf and to scrap bonus payments tied to prescriptions.</p> <p>Another bribery scandal in the US, dating back to 2000, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/03/glaxosmithkline-fined-bribing-doctors-pharmaceuticals\">led to a record $3bn (\u00a32.1bn) fine for GSK in 2012</a>. Just last month it was accused of cheating the NHS and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/12/glaxosmithkline-fined-anti-competitive-behaviour-seroxat\">fined \u00a337.6m over the cost of anti-depressants</a>, but GSK disputed the ruling and said it actually saved the taxpayer money. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>However, Witty will also be remembered for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/22/novartis-glaxosmithkline-deal-pharmaceutical-shares\">three-part, $20bn deal with Swiss rival Novartis</a> in 2014 to pool consumer healthcare assets and exchange their oncology and vaccine businesses, which was hailed as an innovative deal in the industry.</p> <p>He said: \u201cBy next year, I will have been CEO for nearly 10 years and I believe this will be the right time for a new leader to take over. In making this decision it has been important to me that the board have the time to conduct a full and proper process and that we sustain the momentum of our current business performance.\u201d</p> <p>GSK\u2019s chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, paid tribute to him, saying: \u201cAndrew\u2019s retirement next year will represent the culmination of 32 years of service and leadership to GSK and the industry.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong><br></strong><br></p> <p><strong><br></strong><br></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne has only a 50% chance of fulfilling his plans to deliver a \u00a310bn surplus on the public finances by 2020, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said. On Wednesday, Osborne was forced to acknowledge in his budget statement that a sharp deterioration in the growth forecasts published by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) meant the public finances were \u00a356bn weaker than expected over the next five years, more than reversing the \u00a327bn windfall the OBR predicted as recently as November. The chancellor said Whitehall departments would make spending cuts at the end of the parliament to help meet his pledge to balance the books. But Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, raised the prospect of fresh spending cuts or tax rises if the economy deteriorated further. Analysing the OBR\u2019s latest forecasts, Johnson said at the thinktank\u2019s regular post-budget briefing: \u201cThe problem for the chancellor though is perhaps less that some of these changes were made, and more that he is running out of wriggle room. \u201cHis chances of him having a surplus in 2019-20 are only just the right side of 50-50.\u201d Osborne set up the independent OBR when he arrived at No 11 to prevent the Treasury from politicising economic forecasts \u2013 a charge often levelled at Gordon Brown when he was chancellor. But with the outlook for the public finances darkening, and Osborne keen to show that he can meet his self-imposed rule of bringing the public finances back into the black, the Treasury used a series of accounting tricks, including delaying rule changes on when big firms will pay their tax bills, to make the sums add up. The thinktank director also expressed concern about downgraded OBR forecasts for the UK\u2019s potential productivity growth. \u201cIf the OBR is right about that we should all be worried. This will lead to lower wages and living standards, not just lower tax revenues for the Treasury,\u201d Johnson said. He was critical of Osborne\u2019s decision to freeze fuel duty for a sixth year running, adding: \u201cOne must begin to wonder whether these duties will ever rise again, especially given current low oil prices.\u201d Johnson said: \u201cGiven that the harm created by driving in terms of increased congestion is rising, as is the harm from carbon emissions created by using petrol, we might also be worried by the economic and environmental cost of continuing with this policy.\u201d He said the new tax announced on sugary drinks in Osborne\u2019s budget to tackle childhood obesity was a \u201csound one in economic terms\u201d but added: \u201cIt is similar to the case for a tax on alcohol. It is rather harder to implement, however, and a tax on soft drinks is clearly only very partial.\u201d On Wednesday, the director of the OBR, Robert Chote, appeared to place a question mark over the plausibility of the chancellor\u2019s plans, comparing his repeated tendency to offer short-term \u201cgiveaways\u201d paid for with longer-term \u201ctakeaways\u201d to St Augustine\u2019s plea: \u201cLord make me chaste, but not yet.\u201d Osborne defended the budget, saying: \u201cI have made adjustments to my plan, to make sure we live within our means.\u201d He added: \u201cI did not hide from setting out the challenges our country faces and the action we\u2019re going to take.\u201d The chancellor, who has faced pressure from his own backbenchers over some of his plans, including cuts to benefits for disabled people, insisted that his surplus target was not a \u201cfetish\u201d, and said: \u201cWhat it\u2019s really about is economic security, a country that has a plan.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, also appearing on the Today programme on Thursday, accused Osborne of raising more money from some of the weakest in society, to pay for tax cuts for the rich. \u201cHe has made a political choice: he\u2019s put the interests of the rich in this country before those of the most vulnerable,\u201d McDonnell said. Labour has said it would reverse cuts to personal independence payments for disabled people, funded partly by cancelling the chancellor\u2019s tax cuts for business. Wednesday\u2019s budget statement was Osborne\u2019s last before voters go to the polls to decide whether Britain should remain in the EU. A vote to leave would be widely expected to trigger a Conservative leadership contest, in which the chancellor would square up against Boris Johnson, the outgoing mayor of London and darling of grassroots Tory party members. The chancellor sought to show his backbenchers \u2013 and the public \u2013 that his stewardship of the economy will allow him to hit his target of delivering a surplus on the public finances by 2020, while still tempting voters with tax cuts. But the OBR slashed its growth forecasts for each of the next four years and said the chancellor would only be able to avoid breaking the third of his three fiscal promises by \u201cshuffling\u201d spending and tax receipts to engineer a \u00a310bn surplus in 2019-20. Chote said pointedly that Osborne was meeting \u201cthe letter\u201d of his self-imposed rule to run a budget surplus by the end of the current parliament, noting that \u201cgiveaways\u201d averaging \u00a36bn in 2017-18 and 2018-19 would be followed by \u201ctakeaways\u201d averaging \u00a313bn in the following two years. In total, Chote said, the weaker than expected outlook had blown a \u00a356bn hole in the public finances over the next five years \u2013 more than twice the \u00a327bn improvement Osborne was handed in the autumn statement, which helped pay for his costly U-turn on tax credits. \u201cThe sofa has swallowed roughly two pounds this time for every one that it yielded last time,\u201d Chote said. The chancellor has already missed his targets for capping welfare spending and debt reduction, and the OBR said he would have broken his deficit reduction rule had he not deferred tax increases for companies, increased pension contributions for Whitehall departments, brought forward infrastructure spending and intensified the squeeze on disability benefit payments. Higher-rate taxpayers were the main beneficiaries of Osborne\u2019s income tax cuts. A distributional analysis by Liverpool Economics for the Guardian showed that the changes to income tax thresholds would benefit better-off families far more than those on low and middle incomes. On average, the top 10% of families would gain by more than \u00a3400 a year \u2013 more than five times as much as families in the middle of the income distribution. The big surprise was Osborne\u2019s announcement of a tax on sugary drinks, designed to combat childhood obesity. When introduced in 2018, the tax will raise \u00a3500m by levying a charge of up to 8p on a standard 330ml can. But the chancellor could face a backbench rebellion over cuts to disability benefit payments. The budget revealed that a cumulative \u00a34bn would be cut from the budget for disabled people over the course of the parliament, in a move that Labour described as \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d.",

The revelations appear in documents obtained under freedom of information laws by the NSW Nature Conservation Council and revealed by Fairfax Media. Staff in the Office of Environment and Heritage thought the expansion of what could count as an offset went too far, and was a political decision, rather than one based on the science. Staff said the \u201crecord of success in biodiversity restoration from the rehabilitation of degraded land (specifically mine sites) is very poor\u201d and questioned \u201cwhether restoration of biodiversity on a degraded site is even possible\u201d.

Even the federal government had concerns about the policy, noting that giving companies offset credit for rehabilitating mine sites might imply that mine rehabilitation was not already mandatory. \u201cThe NSW policy does not clearly state that this rehabilitation will be additional to what is already required of mining companies and state agencies under existing legislation and industry practice,\u201d an internal working document from the commonwealth environment department says. The broadened definition of offsets was said by NSW Office of Environment and Heritage staff in one of the documents to be a \u201cbalance [that] was ultimately struck was a decision of government\u201d. The revelations follow earlier documents uncovered by Guardian Australia, showing the federal government was devolving offsetting decision-making to NSW, despite NSW offsetting policies not meeting federal criteria. \u201cSomething is seriously wrong when a government dismisses the advice of its environmental experts when developing key environmental policy,\u201d said Kate Smolski, the chief executive of the Nature Conservation Council. \u201cAllowing mining companies to count rehabilitation of mine sites as offset credits defies logic and does not meet community expectations. \u201cIn light of that, we are calling on the government to conduct a thorough public review of its flawed NSW major projects biodiversity offsets policy. \u201cIt is only reasonable that mining companies be made to clean up their messes and do everything they can to restore the landscape as close as possible to the condition that existed before mining started.\u201d A spokesman for the environment minister, Mark Speakman, told Fairfax Media that revegetation was permitted to make \u201ca limited contribution as an offset\u201d. \u201cThe mine site rehabilitation must be to a high ecological standard, creating a recognisable vegetation community that will sustain itself,\u201d he is quoted saying, adding it must be \u201cbeyond what a mining company would normally be required to do\u201d. And a spokesman for the resources minister, Anthony Roberts, told Fairfax Media the department \u201censures that mine sites post-closure are both safe and rehabilitated back to same state or better\u201d condition.",

      "bodyText": "In his address at the National Press Club on Tuesday, the opposition leader Bill Shorten committed a future ALP government to achieving \u201cfull employment\u201d. It\u2019s a worthy goal, but should not come at any cost \u2013 which is why it is good to see the ALP placing as much focus on underemployment as it is on the overall level of unemployment. The desire for full-employment is a long held commitment, dating in Australia back to the 1945 White Paper on Employment drafted when Ben Chifley was Treasurer, and the Treasury was headed by HC Coombs. The Reserve Bank as one of its legislated aims must \u201censure that the monetary and banking policy of the Bank\u201d is directed such that it will best contribute to \u201cthe maintenance of full employment in Australia\u201d Crucially it is also required to contribute to \u201cthe stability of the currency of Australia\u201d. And this influences the meaning of \u201cfull employment\u201d. No one expects full employment to mean 0% unemployment \u2013 there will always be some unemployment for various reasons \u2013 such as you may have a skill but at that particular time there are not the jobs for that skill. The crucial aspect is the intersection of full employment and stable currency. This intersection is the glorious economic acronym of the \u201cNairu\u201d, or the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. Essentially it is the lowest the unemployment rate at which inflation rate remains steady. The problem is, it\u2019s a bit of a moveable feast. Back in the 1960s, 2% unemployment was almost a given, whereas it is now over 40 years since (in trend terms at least) our unemployment rate has been below 4%: We should remember though that 2% unemployment back in 1966 was a bit easier to achieve than it would be now. For a start, back then only 36% of women were in the labour force \u2013 either working or looking for work; now it is 59.5%. How big a difference is that? Were women\u2019s participation rate to be just 36%, it would mean 2.3m fewer women in the labour force. So while looking at past unemployment rates may have us longing for better times, the reality is they were mostly better so long as you were male \u2013 at least as far as getting a job goes. That\u2019s not to say fewer people were working back then \u2013 in 1974 a peak of 61% of the population over 15 was working \u2013 just below the current level of 61.3%: The difference was back then if you weren\u2019t working you were much more likely to be out of the labour force altogether rather than looking for work and thus being technically unemployed. So what level is full-employment now? Shorten in his speech didn\u2019t specify a number, but on ABC\u2019s 7:30 he suggested a target of 5% unemployment. That is a target that sounds about right, if even a little high. Since 1992, after we came out of the recession and once the RBA began targeting inflation of 2%-3%, the point at which inflation begins accelerating is pretty obvious: Once the unemployment rate hit 5% in 2006, the underlying inflation rate stayed above 2.5% and once the unemployment rate went below 4.5% inflation began rising sharply \u2013 reaching 4.9% in August 2008, at which point the GFC shoved the inflation genie back in its bottle and unemployment rose to 5.8% in trend terms \u2013 the same level it is now. A big reason why inflation rises faster when unemployment gets to a certain level is the lack of capacity. There basically are not enough workers in the right place with the right skills to do all the work. We can see this in the massive surge in skill shortage in 2007 and 2008 when unemployment was low and inflation began to rise: Currently there is much more spare capacity in the labour market, and thus very low pressure on wages. But much of Shorten\u2019s speech talked of increasing capacity \u2013 through training and \u201cinvestments in infrastructure, renewables, defence manufacturing, biotechnology, tourism, food and fibre\u201d. Ideally that would lower the \u201cNairu\u201d. And indeed given our current very low wages growth, there is some speculation that lower unemployment could be achieved before inflation starts letting rip. The RBA noted in its latest minutes that \u201cthe increasingly globalised nature of the labour force\u201d may be a factor in keeping wages growth lower than in the past. If so, that could mean a lower Nairu is possible as wages growth will stay weaker than in the past as unemployment falls. But Shorten was right not to place too much emphasis on the actual unemployment rate. Instead, in both his speech and the 7:30 interview he spent a deal of time talking about underemployed workers. Currently around 8.5% of those in the labour force would like to work more hours. That is actually higher than the 7.9% underemployment rate in the middle of 2009, when unemployment was at the 5.8% level it is now. So we have a case where unemployment is where it was at the peak of the GFC, but where underemployment is higher. The reason is because since then the big jobs growth has been for part-time employment. Since July 2009, time full-time employment has grown by 8.2%, but the adult population has grown by 10.8% so there is now a smaller percentage of adults employed full-time: But the big reason for this is younger workers. In July 2009, 31.8% of people aged 15 to 24 were employed full-time, now it is just 27.9%; whereas the level of full-time workers aged 25 to 64 has actually increased \u2013 from 56.1% to 56.5%: It\u2019s why when you look at the rises in underemployment \u2013 those aged 15-24 are the big movers: Rather sensibly, the ALP have noted this. On Wednesday night they also released a report on inequality, entitled \u201cGrowing Together\u201d. It notes that \u201con average, it takes young people 4.7 years from leaving full-time education to entering full-time work\u201d. Achieving full-time employment and also reducing underemployment will need to focus on ways to reduce that time. Part-time work is an important part of the labour market, but it has never been a sign of economic health for full-time employment to be growing slower than the population. Aiming for full-employment is a worthy goal, but it is also sensible that the ALP have released the goal in line with its research paper on inequality. Full-employment and a low unemployment rate is no real achievement if it comes through short hours of work, in low paid jobs with little security.",
