      "bodyText": "England\u2019s care regulator has warned that one of the country\u2019s largest home care providers, private equity-owned Allied Healthcare, could stop operating at the end of the month. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) has written to 84 local authorities telling them as many as 9,300 elderly and vulnerable people are at risk of losing their home care services after 30 November. The CQC has written to the local authorities across England telling them there is a \u201ccredible risk\u201d that Allied may have to cease services when a loan payment becomes due at the end of the month. Allied, the largest provider of domiciliary care in the UK, is owned by German private equity investor Aurelius. About 13,000 people receive care from Allied across the UK, including Wales and Scotland. Allied is also a major provider to the National Health Service. Andrea Sutcliffe, the CQC\u2019s chief inspector of adult social care, said the regulator has \u201cnot received adequate assurance that the company has, or will have, the ongoing funding or new investment necessary to ensure the business can operate beyond [30 November]. \u201cWe have encouraged Allied Healthcare to provide us with a realistic financially backed plan to support the future sustainability of the business, and given them every opportunity to do so, but they have failed to provide adequate assurance regarding future funding.\u201d However, in a statement Allied insisted its care provision is \u201csustainable and safe\u201d. It is understood that the lender behind the working capital facility due to be repaid on 30 November intends to extend the loan until the new year, while the company is also in discussions with alternative lenders. The Allied statement said the firm is \u201csurprised and deeply disappointed\u201d by CQC\u2019s move, describing it as \u201cpremature and unwarranted\u201d. The CQC \u201cdisregarded\u201d its assurances, Allied said. The CQC is obliged to notify local authorities if it thinks a firm carrying out regulated care services is likely to collapse, to allow councils time to prepare contingency plans. Simon Bottery, a senior fellow at the King\u2019s Fund, a health thinktank, said: \u201cThe problems faced by Allied Healthcare are a symptom of the huge pressures facing a social care system which is at breaking point after years of underfunding.\u201d He added that the problems are \u201cyet another wakeup call to the huge problems in social care\u201d for the government ahead of an expected green paper outlining reforms to the sector. Allied has endured a difficult period in recent years, alongside other struggling care providers. In May it agreed a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) with unsecured creditors, including landlords, suppliers and a closed pension scheme, allowing it to delay payment on some of its debts.",

      "bodyText": "Farewell to the FOBTs, if only in supercharged form. William Hill is off to the US to seek its fortune. That, at least, was the gist of chief executive Philip Bowcock\u2019s pitch to investors that set the eye-catching ambition to double operating profits in the next five years. Unfortunately, he started with a step backwards, since the FOBTs, meaning that the soulless fixed-odds betting terminals are still making their presence felt, even before the government cuts maximum stakes. \u201cAdverse regulatory and tax changes\u201d will hit profits by \u00a320m this year and \u00a325m next, and the blame can largely be pinned on the machines. The tax changes are to compensate the Treasury for loss of revenue when stakes are cut. The regulatory demand to get tough on money laundering and suchlike has followed partly because the entire bookmaking industry, via its belligerent defence of FOBTs in the face of overwhelming evidence of consumer harm, made itself an object of suspicion. The shares fell 6% and stand close to a six-year low. Still, the vision of profitable expansion in the rapidly legalising US market is intriguing. William Hill says it wants to be in every US state and be the market leader, which, if it happens, would clearly be an achievement, given America\u2019s huge potential. The hard part to believe, though, is that local operators will let Europeans collect the winnings. William Hill stands a better chance than most, it should be said. It has a longstanding legal operation in Nevada and is now the only firm with operations in all five states to have legalised. But regulated US markets, whatever it says on the tin, can also be protectionist places where the home side usually wins. Bowcock, bravely or naively, set a target of boosting top-line profits in the US from $50m to $300m by 2023. If that\u2019s credible, the gamble on rapid expansion is clearly worth taking. But you can\u2019t blame investors for deciding that they\u2019ll believe the US bonanza when they see it. The problems at home are real \u2013 success in US is several years away. Greene King\u2019s troubled brew Rooney Anand, long-serving chief executive of Greene King, will step down next year, and the brewer and pubs chain is planning a big bash, if chairman Philip Yea\u2019s words are a guide. \u201cI should like to take this opportunity to thank him publicly on behalf of the board, colleagues and shareholders for all he has done for them,\u201d gushed Yea. So, what\u2019s he done for shareholders? The company\u2019s PR firm needed no invitation to push this \u201ckey statistic\u201d for Anand\u2019s tenure: \u201cTen-year total shareholder is nearly 200%.\u201d Hold on a minute, though: Anand has been chief executive for 14 years, so why are you quoting a number for only the last decade? The answer, of course, is that the scoreboard is more flattering if you start counting from November 2008, when most share prices were whacked after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Greene King fell as low as 300p. But the share price when Anand became chief executive in May 2005 was roughly 500p. There have been excursions along the way to 900p, but the current price, within a penny or two, is once again 500p. In other words, on a 14-year view, all the work on shareholder returns has been done by dividends. What\u2019s the true return for investors under Anand? After some prodding, the company coughed up a figure of 84%, which works out at a compound annual rate of about 4%. No investor ever got rich on that. To be fair to Anand, Greene King has done better than most rivals in a soggy sector that has had to absorb rises in the minimum wage and business rates and the 2007 smoking ban. But, come on, the 200% boast is grossly misleading. Put it in the slops tray. If the energy tariff cap fits \u2026 Good luck, Dermot Nolan, chief executive of Ofgem \u2013 you\u2019ll need it next February. That is when the energy regulator, having just set a default tariff that will \u201csave\u201d 11m customers \u00a376 on average, must rework its models to take account of the latest wholesale prices. Those prices are rising, with an inevitable knock-on effect on the new maximum default tariff. It is possible that the entire \u201csaving\u201d could be reversed. The design of the system is sensible, since companies still have to be able to make an economic return. But the government\u2019s insistence on using the word \u201ccap\u201d, with its suggestion of permanence, was the wrong way to describe a tariff that can move in either direction every six months. Ministers, you can be sure, will let Nolan catch the flak.",

      "bodyText": "A European Union plan to tax Google, Facebook and other internet firms risks failure after a handful of member states announced their opposition. EU countries are studying proposals to levy a 3% tax on big internet companies that make money from user data or digital advertising, in a bid to level the playing field with bricks-and-mortar companies that pay more tax. But the idea, which must be agreed unanimously by all 28 member states, is running into serious opposition, as Ireland, Sweden and Denmark made their criticism public on Tuesday. Germany had initially supported the idea in a joint agreement with France, but is now seeking to water down and delay the proposals, moves that are causing deep frustration in Paris. A dozen countries are moving ahead with their own national digital taxes, with Spain and the UK among the recent converts. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced last week that the UK was prepared to go it alone, with a \u201cnarrowly-targeted\u201d digital services tax that is expected to come into force in April 2020 and raise \u00a3400m for the exchequer. Opponents to the digital tax fear the wrath of Donald Trump\u2019s White House, which regards the EU\u2019s efforts to ensure \u201cfair taxation\u201d of internet giants as an attack on American companies, a charge the EU rejects. Denmark\u2019s finance minister, Kristian Jensen, said that given the way that the tax \u201chas been framed as aiming at US companies, of course there will be a reaction from the United States.\u201d Ireland, which hosts big tech firms including Apple, Facebook and Google, is also opposed. \u201cWhat kind of reaction would this bring if this was a model that was imposed on us?\u201d Irish finance minister Paschal Donohoe asked his counterparts during the live-streamed debate. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, argues that an EU digital tax could spur efforts for an international agreement, led by the the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development thinktank. Paris fears that failure to agree such a high-profile proposal before May\u2019s European elections will be a gift to anti-EU populists, such as Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Rally, formerly the Front National, who claim the EU is in hock to big business. But Le Maire offered a big concession, when he announced on Tuesday that France would support delaying the introduction of an EU tax to allow the OECD to make a comprehensive proposal. Behind the scenes, Paris is deeply disappointed that Berlin has gone cool on the idea after the two countries agreed the initiative more than 18 months ago and reaffirmed it in June in the Meseburg declaration, a Franco-German vision of the EU\u2019s future. It stated the two would aim for \u201can EU agreement on a fair digital taxation by the end of 2018\u201d. The French government is unconvinced that US reaction is any reason to delay, arguing that Germany has no excuse if even the UK, traditionally seen as Washington\u2019s closest ally in Europe, can propose a digital tax. Le Maire still hopes for an agreement in December, but interventions from other member states suggests that is a tall order. Sweden\u2019s economy minister, Magdalena Andersson, said her country could not support the proposal. \u201cI see no government in Sweden that would have any other opinion on this issue.\u201d Hartwig L\u00f6ger, Austria\u2019s finance minister, who chaired the meeting, put a brave face on the divisions, arguing more clarity was needed on whether countries had technical or political objections. \u201cThere is the motivation to find a harmonised solution for Europe,\u201d he said after the meeting. \u201cEven now we have 11 countries \u2013 soon it will be 12 with Spain \u2013 which have national individual solutions on digital taxation.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than 1,400 British jobs are at risk after two European suppliers of car parts, Schaeffler and Michelin, announced plans to close UK factories in a blow to the wider automotive industry ahead of Brexit. Schaeffler, the German car parts supplier, said uncertainty surrounding Brexit had contributed to its decision to close two UK factories, in Llanelli, Wales, and Plymouth, where 570 people are employed. The company said the closures would take place over the next two years. French tyremaker Michelin announced plans to close its factory in Dundee in 2020, nearly 50 years after it opened and where 845 people are employed. It blamed dwindling demand for smaller tyres. It said the decision was unrelated to the Brexit vote. At Schaeffler\u2019s plant in Plymouth, a workforce of 350 people makes bearings and machine parts for the firm\u2019s industrial division as well as the aerospace and defence industries. At Llanelli, about 220 people are employed to make mechanical parts and bearings for the major car manufacturers and other industrial suppliers. The company said it would relocate production from the two UK factories to existing plants in the US, China, South Korea and Germany. The union Unite said it would \u201cfight for every job\u201d as it tries to avert the closures. Tony Burke, assistant general secretary, said: \u201cThis is yet another body blow for the UK\u2019s automotive supply chain and the wider car industry. It should leave no one in any doubt as to what is in store if the UK crashes out of the European Union without a deal that secures tariff-free frictionless trade. \u201cThe uncertainty surrounding the Tories\u2019 shambolic handling of Brexit and their piecemeal industrial strategy is having real consequences. Behind the closures and the uncertainty currently gripping the car industry and component manufacturing are people with bills to pay and families to feed.\u201d The wider UK car industry has repeatedly urged the government to make frictionless trade a priority in Brexit negotiations or risk the loss of thousands of UK jobs. Schaeffler currently employs more than 1,000 people in the UK and said its factory in Sheffield would remain open, while operations at its two logistics centres in Sutton Coldfield and Hereford would be combined in Hereford. Michelin said it was no longer financially viable to keep its Dundee factory open because of a fall in demand for premium tyres of 16-inches and smaller, which are made at the site. It also blamed a shift in that market to low-cost versions made in Asia. John Reid, factory manager at Michelin Dundee, said: \u201cI understand that these proposals will come as a huge blow to our employees and to the city of Dundee as a whole. It\u2019s also a very personal blow for me. \u201cThis factory has faced incredibly tough challenges before and we have come through thanks to the hard work and flexibility of our people and the union, and the backing of the Michelin group. However, the market for the smaller tyres we make has changed dramatically and permanently, and the company has to address these structural changes.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Primark has bucked the retail gloom with \u201cstriking\u201d annual figures showing that its \u201ccheap chic\u201d is drawing shoppers to the high street at a time when rivals are closing stores. The company said sales at UK stores open for more than one year had risen 1.2% in the year to 15 September at a time when British retailers faced a slowdown in fashion sales. The annual increase came despite a difficult second half when the summer heatwave kept shoppers from the high street. Annual profits jumped 15% to \u00a3843m. \u201cThe performance in the UK was striking, with a significant increase in our share of the total clothing market,\u201d said George Weston, the chief executive of the Associated British Foods (ABF) parent group. Primark\u2019s performance was in contrast to the struggling New Look chain, which said at least 85 stores would close as part of the restructuring plan announced earlier this year. In March, New Look predicted 60 closures as a result of its company voluntary arrangement (CVA), but more landlords have opted to take back the keys rather than agree to lower rents. New Look\u2019s executive chairman, Alistair McGeorge, said the future of another 39 stores was in doubt as talks with landlords continued. The veteran retailer has shored up New Look\u2019s financial performance since returning to the helm a year ago, but the trend is still downward, with like-for-like sales 3.7% lower in the 26 weeks to 22 September. Fashion retailers have faced a perfect storm this year as rising costs following last year\u2019s business rates revaluation were compounded by weak consumer spending and a shift to online shopping. Investors are braced for disappointing figures from Marks &amp; Spencer on Wednesday, which some analysts think will show clothing sales down more than 2% as it struggles to arrest a long period of decline. M&amp;S plans to close 100 shops by 2022. Primark \u2013 the UK\u2019s third largest clothing retailer, behind Next and market leader M&amp;S \u2013 is a rare exception these days as it does not sell online. It has defied this year\u2019s gloom and successfully exported its bricks-and-mortar business model overseas to major new markets including the US and Spain. Weston said the retailer used the internet to create a buzz around new ranges among almost 13m shoppers who have subscribed to its social media feeds. \u201cWe can sell clothes in our stores more cheaply than online,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want the best-value clothing, you have to go down to the high street to get it.\u201d Primark will open more than 1m sq ft of new selling space in the coming year, with stores planned in mainland Europe as well as in the UK, including its biggest to date, a 160,000 sq ft branch in Birmingham Pavilions. ABF, boosted by Primark\u2019s strong results, was the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 on Tuesday, closing up 3% at \u00a324.60. Across the ABF group, which also encompasses large grocery, agriculture and ingredients businesses, overall profits were up 3% at \u00a31.4bn on sales of \u00a315.6bn. Its grocery brands include Kingsmill bread, Twinings tea and Silver Spoon sugar. Weston warned that a no-deal Brexit could cause major disruption even if companies attempted to prepare for the worst by stockpiling ingredients, packaging and finished products. \u201cThe reality is, if we lose Dover, we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d said Weston. \u201cIf the Channel tunnel no longer becomes a usable freight route because the French don\u2019t have the customs capability on their side, then the UK food supply chain will struggle.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Drilling starts to tap geothermal power from Cornwall's hot rocks", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A trailblazing energy project has started drilling the UK\u2019s deepest ever borehole in Cornwall in a bid to use heat from hot rocks as a zero-carbon source of electricity. The team behind the \u00a318m scheme hopes to create the UK\u2019s first deep geothermal power station and ignite a renewed interest in the technology\u2019s wider potential. The project near Redruth involves two deep holes being drilled over a course of around six months. Drilling began on Tuesday, with one hole expected to be 1.6 miles (2.5km) deep and the other as far as 2.8 miles (4.5km) down, which would be a UK record for a borehole. Water will then be pumped into the shallower well, where it should be heated by naturally fractured hot rocks deep underground, hitting temperatures of up to 195C. The heated water then comes to the surface via the deeper well, with heat used to produce water vapour that turns a turbine and generates electricity. The water is then injected underground and the cycle starts again. Ryan Law, managing director of Geothermal Engineering, the company behind the project, said the start of drilling was a \u201chuge\u201d moment for geothermal energy in the UK. \u201cFor the broader industry it is a very important project. Should this project succeed it really will be a kickstart to the geothermal industry in the UK,\u201d he said. The site is in the heart of former tin mining country, and Cornwall has long been thought to have the most easily accessible geothermal resources in the UK. The demonstration scheme has been 10 years in the making and has taken an unusual approach to financing an energy project. Around \u00a310.6m hails from EU funding, with \u00a32.4m from Cornwall county council and the remaining \u00a35m raised by a crowdfunding drive. Unlike virtually all other new power stations, it will receive no ongoing subsidies for the electricity it generates. The project is very much a minnow compared with windfarms fast being built around the British coast. The geothermal power station will have a capacity of 3MW, which is about a third of a single modern offshore wind turbine or enough to power around 7,000 homes. While wind is intermittent, however, the Cornish scheme will be able to generate around the clock. Tony Batchelor, an expert dubbed \u201cthe grandfather of geothermal\u201d for his work four decades ago on unlocking the energy of Cornwall\u2019s hot rocks, said the start of drilling was a key step. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite important overall. Our earlier work in the 70s and 80s concluded you wouldn\u2019t really know until you got a deep hole in Cornwall, and here we are, starting with a deep hole in Cornwall.\u201d Batchelor, who is advising on the Redruth operation, said: \u201cThis whole area is the very best that we\u2019ve got. If it can work here, it will work in not dissimilar areas in Devon and Cornwall and you could start looking elsewhere, depending on how it works.\u201d In the future, he said the capacity of projects could be 10-12MW each rather than 3MW, and three or four wells could be fitted on a site without making it much bigger. But he cautioned that it would take time for such a programme. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be quick,\u201d he said. The project is not the UK\u2019s only geothermal scheme, and Law said the firm has already identified up to five other possible sites. Southampton has a much shallower geothermal well that dates back to the 1980s and provides heat and power for local homes. Elsewhere in Cornwall, work is underway to use geothermal to heat the Jubilee Pool in Penzance, and the Eden Project is fundraising for a 5-7MW scheme. Energy experts are split over the commercial prospects of geothermal and whether it could reach scale in the UK. Peter Atherton, an analyst at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight, said: \u201cIt\u2019s like tidal. There is a very large energy source there. But can you get it in a way that is ultimately economic and, secondly, what environmental side-effects does it have? \u201cIf you can tick those two boxes, there is a big resource there. In the south-west there is a decent geothermal geology.\u201d However, energy expert and author Chris Goodall said: \u201cIf this site is successful, hot rocks could provide around 5% of UK electricity and substantial amounts of heat.\u201d Geothermal projects have generated minor earthquakes in the past, but geologists said the risk would depend on the volumes of water and speed with which it is injected. Law said: \u201cAny relative risk of induced seismicity is very well controlled.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "European stock markets have closed lower tonight, as investors await news from the US elections. FTSE 100: down 63 points or -0.9% at 7,040 German DAX: down 10 points or -0.1% at 11,484 French CAC: down 26 points or 0.5% at 5,075 The Footsie was held back by the stronger pound, which makes overseas earnings of multinationals less valuable. In New York, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are both up almost 0.5% though. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the midterm results will swing the markets tomorrow: Surprisingly London traders have been more cautious than their US peers who are awaiting the results of the midterm elections due later tonight. The vote will decide on whether the two US legislative houses remain Republican, like the President, or turn Democrat. The first results for the key swing states are expected around 10pm Eastern time and will colour the trading day Wednesday. For all of President Trump\u2019s threats to his foreign trading partners his domestic economic decisions have injected the US stock markets with some vigour, particularly the massive tax cutting programme. A change in the texture of Congress would hamper his capacity to push through decisions that require legislative approval, causing concerns for businesses. However, some dark clouds are already gathering on the economic horizon, as seen by the massive selloff in stocks and bonds in October. Goodnight! GW You can keep up to date with all the US midterm election action in our liveblog: Over in New York, the US stock market has opened cautiously as midterm voting gets underway. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 50 points, or 0.2%,. The S&amp;P 500 has gained 0.3%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq index has gained almsot 1%. Despite Brexit secretary Raab\u2019s cheeriness, the British cabinet still haven\u2019t actually agreed the terms of the Irish backstop. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman told lobby reporters that an agreement won\u2019t be reached \u201cat any cost\u201d. The key issue is how long the backstop would last (Brexiteers say it can\u2019t be indefinite), and who could end it (Brexiteers want the power to end it). The spokesman said (via our Politics Live blog): [The PM] said that while 95% of the withdrawal agreement had been concluded, on the Northern Ireland backstop there are a number of issues that we still need to work through and these are the most difficult. This includes ensuring that, if the backstop is ever needed, it is not permanent and there\u2019s a mechanism to ensure that the UK could not be held in the arrangement indefinitely. The pound has also nudged a five-month high against the euro, trading as high as \u20ac1.1465. Bloomberg is impressed by the power of Dominic Raab\u2019s thumb to move markets: The responsiveness of the pound to headlines may be well documented, but its sensitivity reached new highs Tuesday as it rallied on a mere hand gesture. Investors had been waiting for news on progress in the Brexit divorce talks with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May gathering her Cabinet Tuesday morning. When BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg tweeted that the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab had said \u201cthumbs up\u201d on the way out of the meeting, it was enough to send the U.K. currency to the day\u2019s high. \u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful to be working in a market where a simple thumbs-up moves a currency by 40 pips?\u201d said Jordan Rochester, an analyst at Nomura International Plc. The pound has jumped to a two-week high as Brexit speculation swirls. Somewhat astonishingly, the rally came after the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg tweeted that Brexit secretary Dominic Raab had given reporters a verbal \u2018thumbs-up\u2019 following a crunch cabinet meeting. There\u2019s no more detail about exactly what Raab meant -- whether he means progress on the Irish backstop, or simply that he\u2019s still optimistic. But it\u2019s enough to send sterling up to $1.3090, up half a cent against the US dollar, at its best position since 22 October. The pound had earlier lost ground after DUP chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson predicted that \u201cwe are heading for no deal.\u201d This rapid rebound suggests the City is extremely anxious for signs that London and Brussels could reach an agreement to avoid the UK crashing out of the EU at the end of March. Rachel Winter, senior investment manager at stockbrokers Killik &amp; Co,isn\u2019t convinced that a Democratic-controlled House would force peace in the trade wars. She writes: \u201cThe President uses the stock market as a barometer of his own success and is clearly keen to keep it at a high level. His plans for further expansionary fiscal policy, for example additional tax cuts and more infrastructure spending, would also have positive consequences for the stock market.\u201d \u201cThere is concern that a Democrat majority in the House would cause governmental gridlock, making it difficult to pass further legislative changes. Further tariffs on China might be difficult to implement, which would potentially be good for emerging markets. That said, Democrats have long been critical of the trade imbalance between the US and China, and many leading Democrats applauded Trump\u2019s tariffs.\u201d The New York stock exchange is expected to drop when trading begins in under two hours, as America heads to the polling booths. The futures market is calling the Dow Jones industrial average down around 50 points, or 0.2%. Yesterday it gained 190 points, so that\u2019s not a major reversal. Cautious traders will be sticking to the sidelines until we have some idea of how the midterm elections have played out. Given recent political shocks, they\u2019ll be treating opinion polls warily. As my colleague Tom McCarthy explains, many scenarios are possible: Election night could end with the Republicans retaining their majority in the House of Representatives and strengthening their majority in the Senate, despite a historic exodus of Republicans retiring from Congress, widespread disapproval of Trump and the customary strength of the opposition party at this stage in the elections cycle. Yet some prominent Democrats \u2013 starting with the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi \u2013 are predicting a blue \u201cwave\u201d that will deliver a strong Democratic majority to the House. (Predictions of the Senate flipping blue are notably fewer.) It\u2019s worth remembering that Wall Street\u2019s interests don\u2019t always run parallel to Main Street\u2019s. Indeed, the two thoroughfares can diverge widely when it comes to the state of America, and the global economy. What\u2019s good for The Market isn\u2019t always good for The People. As analysts at FX Pro put it: Wall Street has its own interest. Financial institutions fear that a full control by the Democrats over both houses (the House of Representatives and the Senate) could lead to the restoration of the Dodd-Frank Act, which restricts the activities of banks and the abolition of recent tax cuts. Dodd-Frank imposed new rules on the banking sector to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, ending the \u2018Too Big To Fail\u2019 scandal. It was partly repealed earlier this year, despite warnings that this would increase financial risks. Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms dramatically slashed the corporation tax rate from 35% to 21%, alongside temporary tax cuts for individuals. That helped to drive stock prices up (as firms became more profitable), but has also pushed America\u2019s budget deficit higher. US wages are now rising faster, finally clearing the 3%/year mark for the first time in almost a decade. But while the economy is still growing robustly, business investment actually declined in the last quarter, suggesting the tax windfall isn\u2019t being pumped into new equipment, machinery and infrastructure. European stock markets are falling deeper into the red as lunchtime approaches. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is now down 43 points, or 0.6%, at 7060. Germany\u2019s DAX and the French CAC are both off around 0.2%. Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx blames midterm jitters, as investors wonder whether the Democrats will claim a majority in the House of Representatives: A tentative start turned resolutely negative as Tuesday went on, investors\u2019 midterm election nerves perhaps becoming more pronounced as voting gets underway. Brexit worries are also weighing on traders\u2019 minds, as Theresa May struggles to reach an agreement over the Northern Ireland backstop that will satisfy Brussels and her own cabinet. A senior member of the DUP (who are supporting May\u2019s government) has predicted that Britain would leave the EU without a deal. Many Americans have already made their choice of senator, congressman or woman, or governor, of course. Early voting has been particularly brisk, suggesting the overall turnout at these midterms could be sizzling high as both sides push hard to get the vote out. The polls are open, meaning early-rising Americans on the east coast can cast their ballots. It\u2019ll be hours until we get any exit polls, though. Most polling stations stay open until at least 7pm local time (so midnight onwards for UK readers). Donald Trump\u2019s trade disputes are being blamed for a slowdown across eurozone companies last month. Data firm Markit has reported that private sector growth in the euro area slowed to a two-year low in October. Manufacturing and service sector companies both reported weaker growth, with some blaming \u201cglobal protectionist measures\u201d such as Trump\u2019s tariffs on EU steel. Germany is particularly exposed to trade wars, thanks to its strong export sector. Its private sector growth slumped to a 5-month low and the joint lowest in over two years, The widerIHS Markit Eurozone PMI Composite Output Index dropped to 53.1 in October, down from 54.1 in September, showing a notable slowdown. Analyst Emanuele Canegrati of BPPrime says it\u2019s a bad start to the final quarter of 2018: Investors are also speculating whether the midterms could intensify the legal pressure on the White House. For the last 18 months, special counsel Robert Mueller has been investigating whether there was collusion between Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and the Russian government to affect the 2016 election, and whether obstruction of justice has taken place There\u2019s been little news from Mueller recently, but analysts believe the probe could burst back into the headlines after the elections. Many US newspapers have reported that Trump advisor Roger Stone is in Mueller\u2019s cross-hairs. In August, Stone himself suggested he might soon be indicted. As The Hill reported last weekend: Robert Mueller continues to zero in on Roger Stone as speculation builds that the special counsel could take a major overt step in his Russia investigation following the midterm elections next week. Stone, a longtime adviser to President Trump who briefly worked on his campaign, is viewed as central to the question of what, if anything, members of the Trump campaign knew in advance about Democratic emails hacked by Russian operatives and then released by WikiLeaks. Stephen Innes of foreign exchange trading firm OANDA says investors should keep a close eye on the Mueller probe: The markets are understandably fidgety given the next 48 hours of headline risk.... However, flying under the radar is that these midterm elections carry a sizable legal risk for the GOP which could dent investor confidence as we will likely hear much more from Robert Mueller sooner rather than later. Asia-Pacific stock market have closed higher tonight, apart from China which lost ground. Here\u2019s AFP\u2019s take: Asian markets mostly rose Tuesday as focus turned to the US midterm elections, which could impact Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, while Apple suppliers suffered on reports the tech titan had cancelled plans to ramp up output of its new iPhone. All eyes are on the US mid-term elections today, says currency expert Kit Juckes at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. He writes: Opinion polls point to policy gridlock with a GOP Senate and DEM House, limiting the scope for further fiscal stimulus as the support from current measures fades. That\u2019s the corner-stone of what feels like a consensual view that growth will slow, and rate speak (near 3%) in late 2019, supporting the dollar now, but pointing to a turn in its trend in the second half of 2019. Juckes says there are two scenarios which would really rock the markets [reminder, the Republicans currently hold the upper and lower houses of Congress] DEM Senate and DEM House: This would be the most dollar bearish scenario, trigger fears of a lame duck presidency and potential impeachment proceedings. While the Fed would continue the tightening path, political confrontation in Washington would weigh on the dollar. GOP Senate and GOP House (least likely): An all-Republican Congress is the scenario would elicit the strongest market reaction, with the dollar rallying on expectations of further fiscal stimulus. As Donald Trump never tires of pointing out, the US stock market has surged by around 40% since his shock election win two years ago. That\u2019s largely due to the tax cuts which the president pushed through last year, which boosted company profits. That\u2019s catnip to Wall Street (other Trump policies, such as his anti-immigration rhetoric, don\u2019t move the markets) That fiscal stimulus is also inflationary, meaning the US Federal Reserve is under pressure to keep raising US interest rates. So, a strong night for the Democrats could spark a dollar selloff, explains Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group: Dollar bulls are looking for a Republican win, which will supportive of more of Trump\u2019s expansionary fiscal policies being pushed through. A Democrat win, and the resultant political deadlock is considered more bearish for the US dollar and US equities although we expect this to be a short-term reaction. The unexpected result of a blue wave with Democrats taking both the Senate and the House would likely shock the markets resulting in an aggressive selloff in the greenback and US equities. It\u2019s worth noting that the stock market also had a good run under president Obama: Subdued trading this morning has seen London\u2019s main stock index, the FTSE 100, dip into the red It\u2019s accompanied by most other European markets, as traders ponder whether today\u2019s US elections will embolden or restrict president Trump. Here\u2019s our guide to the midterms: The midterm elections have been a bruising experience for many presidents over the years. Losing the House of Representatives in 2010 was a major blow for Barack Obama, for example, making it rather harder for him to push his agenda. Bill Clinton had a similarly bad night in 1994, as the Democrats lost control of the House for the first time in 40 years. That dominance had meant the Republican presidents such as Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon had lacked a majority on Capitol Hill. But surprisingly, this situation hasn\u2019t been bad for asset prices. Quite the reverse. Shares often rise during times of political deadlock -- after all, there\u2019s a reassuring certainty if politicians can\u2019t get anything done. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, has crunched the numbers, and explains: The combination of a Republican President and a split Congress have produced an average return of 15.7% on the S&amp;P 500 in the 12 months following every mid-term election since 1950. These strong returns suggest that investors prefer a gridlock, a situation when different political parties control the two legislative houses. While such anomalies are difficult to explain, investors may find that a gridlock produces more predictable political outcomes to model and value equities against. In the case of a gridlock, Democrats cannot roll back recent tax cuts, neither they can tighten the Dodd-Frank banking rules. It may just mean that Trump will face more difficulties in passing new laws. However, in the current tense environment it seems Wall Street will prefer Republicans to retain both legislative houses. That\u2019s simply because a new tax cut will be expected to take place, further deregulation, and probably additional fiscal stimulus. While such measures are not necessarily good for the longer run as deficit and debt may get out of control, many investors will take advantage of these policies in the shorter run. Given that the polling industry got it wrong in 2016 and Trump became President, history may repeat itself this time again. It would be more surprising if Democrats managed to win both houses. This will be a nightmare for Wall Street, as the Trump impeachment threat will become more real, but still, this would require help from some Republicans. Even if he doesn\u2019t get impeached, the President will no longer have the power to pass bills and probably lead to pulling back some of his deregulatory actions, which definitely is not liked by corporate America. The Chinese stock market lost ground today, as traders worried that the midterms won\u2019t blunt Trump\u2019s trade war instincts. The CSI 300 closed 0.6% lower today, back towards the four-year lows hit last month. Other markets were in better mood, though, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei ending 1% higher and Hong Kong up 0.6%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a buzz of election fever in the markets, as Americans prepare to head to the polls in the midterm elections. As usual, the midterms are partly a referendum on the White House\u2019s performance, potentially strengthening or loosening a president\u2019s grip on the levers of power. Investors around the globe are watching nervously to see whether the Democrats can seize control of the lower House of Representatives. Polls suggest they\u2019ve got a good chance. Republicans, though, will probably maintain their grip on the Senate. A good night for the Democrats could allow them to block Trump from further tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus. They could also try to restrict his ability to launch destabilising trade wars with other nations (although the president has plenty of unilateral powers here too). That could weaken the dollar (as it removes some pressure to raise interest rates), bringing relief to emerging market currencies. A Democrat-controlled House could (and surely would) also launch fresh investigations into the president\u2019s conduct, casting the shadow of impeachment over the White House. That could send stocks sliding on Wall Street. But if the Republican vote holds up, Trump would be re-energised to continue pushing his America First strategy - creating more volatility in the markets, and possibly intensifying the trade dispute with China. So currencies, stocks and bonds around the world will be affected by where millions of Americans put their cross today. Tom Fitzgerald, co-manager of the Amity International Fund at EdenTree Investment Management explains: So far, Republican control of the legislative powers \u2013 the House of Representatives and the Senate \u2013 has made possible President Donald Trump\u2019s large fiscal package and his deregulation agenda, as well as protected him from various ongoing investigations. An election outcome favourable to the Republicans, maintaining both the House and Senate, could set the global economy and markets on a very different path at a time when both Europe and China are showing signs of weakness. In such a scenario, President Trump would have broader policy options, including on the fiscal front and the ability to carry on with his deregulation agenda. The market could perceive this scenario as the most pro-growth, as it would raise the chances of larger tax cuts and additional spending. In contrast, in a scenario of favourable election results to the Democrats, giving them control of the House and Senate, President Trump would have very limited policy options for the rest of the legislature. As further fiscal easing may not be possible, President Trump might focus policy efforts on the trade war against China or implement trade threats against the EU. Europe would therefore be negatively affected by such shocks, given the large impact of car tariffs on Germany and Europe. Also coming up today New surveys of purchasing managers at service sector companies across the eurozone are released. They\u2019re expected to confirm that growth slowed in October, matching the slowdown at UK services firms that was reported yesterday. But there\u2019s better news from Germany this morning; factory orders rose by 0.3% in September, stronger than expected.

That dominance had meant the Republican presidents such as Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon had lacked a majority on Capitol Hill.</p> <p>But surprisingly, this situation hasn\u2019t been bad for asset prices. Quite the reverse. Shares often rise during times of political deadlock -- after all, there\u2019s a reassuring certainty if politicians can\u2019t get anything done. </p> <p><strong>Hussein Sayed, </strong>Chief Market Strategist at <strong>FXTM</strong>, has crunched the numbers, and explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The combination of a Republican President and a split Congress have produced an average return of 15.7% on the S&amp;P 500 in the 12 months following every mid-term election since 1950. These strong returns suggest that investors prefer a gridlock, a situation when different political parties control the two legislative houses. While such anomalies are difficult to explain, investors may find that a gridlock produces more predictable political outcomes to model and value equities against. In the case of a gridlock, Democrats cannot roll back recent tax cuts, neither they can tighten the Dodd-Frank banking rules. It may just mean that Trump will face more difficulties in passing new laws. </p> <p>However, in the current tense environment it seems Wall Street will prefer Republicans to retain both legislative houses. That\u2019s simply because a new tax cut will be expected to take place, further deregulation, and probably additional fiscal stimulus. While such measures are not necessarily good for the longer run as deficit and debt may get out of control, many investors will take advantage of these policies in the shorter run. Given that the polling industry got it wrong in 2016 and Trump became President, history may repeat itself this time again. </p> <p>It would be more surprising if Democrats managed to win both houses. This will be a nightmare for Wall Street, as the Trump impeachment threat will become more real, but still, this would require help from some Republicans. Even if he doesn\u2019t get impeached, the President will no longer have the power to pass bills and probably lead to pulling back some of his deregulatory actions, which definitely is not liked by corporate America.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-11-06T08:48:53.735Z\">at 8.48am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5be14db6e4b03c2018f40992\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-11-06T08:24:20.854Z\">8.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Chinese stock market lost ground today, as traders worried that the midterms won\u2019t blunt Trump\u2019s trade war instincts.</strong></p> <p>The CSI 300 closed 0.6% lower today, back towards the four-year lows hit last month. </p> <p>Other markets were in better mood, though, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei ending 1% higher and Hong Kong up 0.6%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Investingcom/status/1059718291348963329\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udcc8 Asian shares inched up on Tuesday, supported by Wall Street gains although momentum was tempered ahead of the U.S. midterm elections... <a href=\"https://t.co/eH0g3bR5Zu\">https://t.co/eH0g3bR5Zu</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nikkei?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Nikkei</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Shanghai?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Shanghai</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CSI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CSI</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AAPL&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$AAPL</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/stocks?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#stocks</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/shares?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#shares</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/asia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#asia</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/7PiyHdLz0W\">pic.twitter.com/7PiyHdLz0W</a></p>&mdash; Investing.com (@Investingcom) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Investingcom/status/1059718291348963329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 6, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5be13d98e4b03c2018f40972\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-11-06T08:02:53.205Z\">8.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The agenda: midterm nerves grip markets</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"391f04a13bf7c5c2e0d49222ce9ef594b091c222\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/391f04a13bf7c5c2e0d49222ce9ef594b091c222/0_0_4998_3144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, left, gives a thumbs up and winks as President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, yesterday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, left, gives a thumbs up and winks as President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, yesterday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Roberson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s a buzz of election fever in the markets, as Americans prepare to head to the polls in the midterm elections.</p> <p>As usual, the midterms are partly a referendum on the White House\u2019s performance, potentially strengthening or loosening a president\u2019s grip on the levers of power.</p> <p>Investors around the globe are watching nervously to see whether the Democrats can seize control of the lower House of Representatives.

The market could perceive this scenario as the most pro-growth, as it would raise the chances of larger tax cuts and additional spending.</p> <p>In contrast, in a scenario of favourable election results to the Democrats, giving them control of the House and Senate, President Trump would have very limited policy options for the rest of the legislature.

      "bodyText": "Energy prices are likely to rise just three months after the government\u2019s price cap takes effect on 1 January, Ofgem has admitted. The energy regulator revealed that the final level of the cap would be \u00a31,137 a year for a typical customer on a default tariff, up by \u00a31.23 on the provisional level it laid out in September. That should amount to an average saving of about \u00a376 for the 11m households on default tariffs, but any relief for consumers may be short-lived. Ofgem noted that wholesale costs are about 35% higher than a year ago. \u201cIf this trend in underlying costs continues, it is likely that in February 2019 we will announce an increase in the level of the cap to take effect in April,\u201d it said on Tuesday. Comparison sites and industry groups warned that more rises were coming despite the cap, and urged people to switch to better deals. Stephen Murray, an energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, said: \u201cIf you do nothing, you could be in for a nasty surprise come spring next year.\u201d Richard Neudegg, the head of regulation at uSwitch.com, added: \u201cThere is a very good chance that the price of standard tariffs will change three times over the next 12 months, and potentially for the worse rather than the better.\u201d Industry watchers have previously warned that cost pressures on suppliers could drive up bills by 5%, or about \u00a360, by next April. The government said the cap, which will be updated every six months, would make the market fairer. Claire Perry, the energy minister, said: \u201cToday\u2019s final cap level brings greater fairness to energy prices and puts consumers at the heart of the energy market.\u201d But trade body Energy UK said competition was already growing and the cap posed a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d to many of the 70-plus suppliers on the market. MPs and fuel poverty groups also raised concerns over 1m households being shifted from an existing, lower cap for vulnerable customers to the new, higher cap. Rachel Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee, said ministers needed to: \u201censure that vulnerable customers do not slip through the net and actually find themselves worse off.\u201d Consumer group Citizens Advice said while the cap would make prices fairer for many consumers, they would save more by changing tariff or supplier. Which? magazine also pointed out the cap will not touch the third of tariffs above the cap, because they are fixed ones rather than \u201cstandard variable\u201d default tariffs. Ofgem conceded that the number of households switching may go down under the cap, potentially by as much as half, but more likely 30%-40%. That would reverse years of growth in switches, and see millions fewer households changing supplier. The energy regulator expects the cap will knock 5% off energy firms\u2019 profits, and wipe up to \u00a31.18bn off their revenues. British Gas owner Centrica and SSE, the market\u2019s two biggest players, saw their shares rise by 1.49% and 0.65% respectively. While the cap is set at \u00a31,137 a year for what Ofgem defines as typical usage of electricity and gas, people who are higher energy consumers will pay more. The cap is the maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy and for a standing charge.",

      "bodyText": "William Hill has warned of lower full-year profits following the closure of a number of customer accounts to combat problem gambling and money laundering, as well as the government\u2019s clampdown on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). The bookmaker also blamed a tax increase and tough conditions on the high street, as it downgraded its full-year profit forecast to between \u00a3225m and \u00a3245m. Analysts had pencilled in profits of \u00a3242.6m; last year the company made \u00a3291.3m. In a trading update, William Hill said it benefited from the later stages of the World Cup, but lost out out to punters on football results in October and had three loss-making weeks on horse racing during the summer. It said online profits this year would be \u00a320m lower this year than previously thought, and \u00a325m down next year, partly due an increase in remote gaming duty from 15% to 21%. But the main impact is from tougher affordability and source of income checks on online customers, which have prompted some to switch to other betting firms and led to William Hill shutting more accounts. The government has forced bookmakers to carry out more checks on people betting online, to tackle problem gambling and prevent money laundering. William Hill was fined \u00a36.2m by the Gambling Commission in February for failing to combat money laundering in the two years to August 2016. The watchdog found that 10 customers were able to deposit money linked to criminal offences, including one customer who was stealing from their employer to fund a gambling problem and another who was defrauding elderly victims. It was the commission\u2019s second-biggest penalty on record, following a \u00a37.8m fine for the betting firm 888 last year for its failure to protect vulnerable customers. About 7,000 of them were still able to access their accounts and place bets despite voluntarily asking to be excluded. William Hill still plans to close up to 900 betting shops that have become unprofitable \u2013 nearly two-fifths of the total \u2013 following the government\u2019s decision to slash maximum stakes on FOBTs from \u00a3100 to \u00a32. As a result, it took a \u00a3915m accounting charge in the first six months of the year, pushing it into a first-half loss of \u00a3820m. Philip Bowcock, the William Hill chief executive, said: \u201cWe are continuing to experience a period of significant change for our industry and have already made important changes over the last two years to transform our digital business, broaden the management team and enhance our financial flexibility ahead of key regulatory changes.\u201d Campaigners have criticised the Gambling Commission for not doing enough to stop problem gambling. In June, the industry watchdog warned betting companies would face a \u201crelentless escalation\u201d in penalties if they did not introduce extra checks on online customers. The commission\u2019s enforcement report found failings in respect of \u201cVIP customers\u201d who lost hundreds of thousands of pounds and used stolen money to fund their problem gambling. The regulator imposed \u00a318m of fines on gambling companies in the year to 1 April, up from \u00a31.6m the previous year. New rules that took effect on 31 October promise tougher action against gambling companies that break advertising rules by appealing to children or glamourising gambling, or breach consumer law by making it hard for customers to withdraw their money, or send \u2019spam\u2019 marketing emails or texts. Faced with the clampdown in the UK, William Hill is pushing into the lucrative US sports betting market, where several states have legalised betting on football, baseball, basketball and other sports following a supreme court ruling in May. Bowcock said William Hill was the only company to be taking sports bets in the first five states to have regulated sports betting \u2013 Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi and West Virginia. \u201cOur goal is to be in every state,\u201d he said. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, and that\u2019s the $5bn-$19bn US sports betting market. William\u2019s Hill\u2019s been fast out the stalls, an advantage of already being an established player in Nevada, and has started racking up the bets.\u201d William Hill shares fell by 8% in early trading, and later traded down 3.4% at 206.4p.",
