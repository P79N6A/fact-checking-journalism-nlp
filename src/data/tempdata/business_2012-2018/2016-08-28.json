      "bodyText": "The remaining 22 BHS stores downed shutters for the final time on Sunday, bringing to an end the department store\u2019s 88-year history on the high street. BHS began as an affordable general store in Brixton in south London in 1928 and became one of the stalwarts of the British high street. Its collapse into administration in April is the largest retail failure since Woolworths in 2008 and has left 11,000 people without jobs. The administrators, Duff &amp; Phelps, had already closed 141 stores in recent weeks, including its flagship Oxford Street branch in the West End of London. Scores of bargain hunters turned up at the last BHS shops over the weekend, with queues forming outside some branches on Sunday. Some shoppers snapped up heavily discounted goods, while others walked away empty-handed, disappointed by what was left. Several people said it was a sad day and that they would miss the department store. The stores were largely stripped of merchandise, shelves and other fittings and several branches shut before the official closing time. While staff oversaw the last of the closing-down sales, former BHS owner Sir Philip Green continued his holiday in the Mediterranean on board his new \u00a3100m super yacht, Lionheart. The Labour MP Frank Field, a fierce critic of Green, renewed his attack on the billionaire, accusing him of asset stripping at BHS. Field, who chairs the parliamentary work and pensions committee, told Sky that he stood by his description of Green as \u201cevil\u201d. He accused the retail tycoon of \u201cplundering\u201d the company. \u201cWhat he turns out to be is a sort of asset stripper,\u201d Field said. Green owned BHS for 15 years before selling it to former bankrupt Dominic Chappell for \u00a31 in 2015. Green has come under fire for taking more than \u00a3400m in dividends from the now defunct department store chain and for selling it to a man without retail experience. A damning report from the work and pensions and the business, innovations and skills committees found last month that BHS was subject to \u201csystematic plunder\u201d by Green, Chappell and their hangers-on, and labelled Green the \u201cunacceptable face of capitalism\u201d. Chappell is planning to put his personal business into administration this week and is restructuring his assets, in an attempt to avoid a substantial tax bill and to protect his cash from investigations into the failure of BHS. This will further enrage BHS staff. Chappell, a former racing driver, has lined up David Rubin &amp; Partners as the administrator of Swiss Rock Ltd., his personal business, which means he could walk away from its debts, which are thought to include a tax bill on his earnings from BHS. Swiss Rock was paid at least \u00a31.6m by BHS and its parent company as part of his acquisition of the retailer. Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions, which bought BHS last year, received at least \u00a317m from BHS during the 13 months of its ownership. Green wants assurances that regulators will drop their investigation into BHS\u2019s \u00a3571m pension deficit if he makes a voluntary contribution, estimated at at least \u00a3300m, Sky News reported. The Pensions Regulator launched an anti-avoidance probe shortly after the retail tycoon sold BHS to Chappell. Field said it would be \u201cgreat to get a settlement which ensures no one takes a pension cut, but that\u2019s not the end of the story\u201d. Thousands of people have been left in limbo over their pensions, and could lose up to 10% of their retirement pots. It could be months before they get clarity. About 22,000 pensions are estimated to be affected. Asked whether Green should be stripped of his knighthood, Field said there would be considerable pressure from the business community, adding that it was not just Labour MPs but also a large number of Tory MPs \u201cwho will be furious\u201d. \u201cThat is a very big alliance that [Green] has got to break up if he is to keep his knighthood,\u201d he said. But the bigger question, Field said, was how to undo the damage inflicted by Green on the department store chain and its staff. He highlighted the Serious Fraud Office\u2019s investigation into the collapse and whether it was caused by fraud or deception. He said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get the jobs back which is the key thing, but it means justice will be delivered even it it\u2019s late.\u201d Green\u2019s Arcadia retail empire, which includes Topshop, is also under investigation from the Pensions Regulator.",

The last 22 BHS department stores closed on Sunday, drawing down the curtain on the 88-year history of the retailer founded with a store in Brixton, south London. Al Mana group, which is based in Doha, is considering opening new BHS branches in the UK after buying the brand as part of its deal for the international and online business. It is understood that Al Mana is looking for a partner that could operate the stores in the UK, potentially through a franchise model. The stores would most likely be positioned as more upmarket than BHS before its collapse and only a handful would be opened, according to sources close to the company. Al Mana runs stores for Harvey Nichols, Zara and Mango in the Middle East. In June it bought 70 overseas BHS stores and the online business, which employs around 150 people, out of administration. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Despite BHS\u2019s struggles, the international and online divisions were considered the best-performing parts of the retailer. BHS collapsed into administration in April, leading to the loss of around 11,000 jobs and leaving a pension deficit of \u00a3571m. The Insolvency Service, the Financial Reporting Council and The Pensions Regulator are investigating the demise of the retailer.

      "bodyText": "The closure of the BHS store in Wood Green, north London, leaves a big hole on the local high street that will be hard to fill, shoppers say. The Wood Green shop shut its doors for the final time at 2pm on Sunday after more than 40 years, three hours earlier than usual after running out of things to sell. Or, more accurately, running out of stock that anyone wanted to buy. Plastered with posters saying: \u201cAll stock reduced. Store closing. Everything must go,\u201d and: \u201cSave up to 80%\u201d in the windows below the severe grey concrete facade, earlier in the day the shop had been teeming with people looking for last-minute bargains. They rifled through the dozen or so clothes rails that were left, with most of the store stripped bare. Babywear cost \u00a31 an item; T-shirts went for \u00a33, down from \u00a310; denim trousers were discounted to \u00a39 from \u00a330; while a motley collection of women\u2019s shoes, dresses, tops and skirts were priced at \u00a37. All store fixtures, fittings and equipment such as rails and shelves were also for sale, all priced at \u00a325 (originally \u00a350) an item. Ella Luma, who said she was a regular BHS shopper, had popped in with her baby to pick up a bargain, but left empty-handed. She said she was disappointed to see that the store was closing. \u201cDo we know what\u2019s going in here?\u201d That was one of the main questions on shoppers\u2019 minds. Joan McLeish said she had been shopping at the Wood Green store for more than 30 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame it is closing. It\u2019s a loss to us, the community.\u201d She still misses the C&amp;A department store, which closed 16 years ago, and the Marks &amp; Spencer, which closed last year, saying it was hard to find local retailers that sold clothes and homeware of good quality. \u201cIt means you have to go further and further \u2026 [BHS] used to be our shop. When we went on holiday, we got everything here.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very sad,\u201d her husband Patrick chipped in. Arnold De Souza had been buying his clothes at the Wood Green shop on and off over the last four decades, but could not find any men\u2019s clothes on the last day. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a sad thing it\u2019s closing. It\u2019s an institution,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they get this Sir Philip Green. He should have put some more money into the pension fund. He took a lot out in dividends. That\u2019s not fair.\u201d He wondered whether the Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, whose rescue bid for parts of BHS was rejected by the administrators, might have done a better job. Like others, De Souza was concerned about what was left on the Wood Green high street, and said shoppers would have to head to the West End. \u201cIn the area there is nothing now \u2013 a lot of restaurants, pawn shops. If you want something good, there is nothing.\u201d The high street near the BHS store is dominated by charity shops, phone shops, food retailers and betting shops. Another shopper, Iwona Gladysheva, was wearing a pair of trousers she had bought on a previous visit to the store. \u201cMany people are very upset, \u201c she said. \u201cThose pound shops are rubbish. This was a good shop. Why is it closing?\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s closest ally has called for Sir Richard Branson to be stripped of his knighthood, days after his company Virgin released CCTV footage casting doubt on the Labour leader\u2019s claim of train overcrowding. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, used an interview in the Sunday Mirror to call Branson, who lives in the Caribbean, a \u201ctax exile who thinks he can try and intervene and undermine our democracy\u201d. He also repeated his call for the former BHS owner Sir Philip Green, whom he called a \u201cfreeloader\u201d, to lose his title as part of a shakeup of the honours system. He said those who were not \u201cacting in the spirit of our country\u201d should lose their honours. McDonnell\u2019s comments follow days of acrimony between Labour and Virgin after Corbyn\u2019s team released a clip, filmed earlier this month, showing the Labour leader sitting on the floor of a Virgin train claiming he could not find a seat on a \u201cram-packed\u201d train and highlighting his policy to nationalise railways. On Tuesday Virgin released CCTV \u2013 which Branson tweeted \u2013 that it said showed Corbyn\u2019s team walking past rows of vacant seats before filming the clip. McDonnell, who is leading Corbyn\u2019s campaign for the Labour leadership, said: \u201cIt should be a simple choice for the mega-rich. Run off to tax exile if you want. But you leave your titles and your honours behind you when you go.\u201d There is no suggestion that the tax affairs of Branson or Green are illegal. Owen Smith, Corbyn\u2019s rival for the Labour leadership, said in an LBC interview that the shadow chancellor was proposing to punish Branson for \u201ctelling the truth\u201d. McDonnell also called for Green, who lives in Monaco, to lose his title. \u201cWhy should Philip Green, who ran BHS into the ground and paid his wife in Monaco \u00a31bn to avoid UK tax, be honoured with a \u2018Sir\u2019?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe whole honours system is cheapened when freeloaders like Green are given awards.\u201d He added: \u201cIf you have been found to be a tax avoider or a tax exile then you should not be on the honours list to begin with. And you should certainly have it stripped from you if you subsequently have been found to be not acting in the spirit of our country.\u201d Instead, he said, awards should go to \u201cunsung heroes who keep our public services running, or devote a lifetime to local communities\u201d. A spokesman for McDonnell said: \u201cJohn believes that it should be for parliament to ultimately decide who is or who is not stripped of their title, if enough members of the public campaign for it. \u201cBut he would not support tax exiles or businessmen who mistreat their employees retaining their titles.\u201d The Labour MP John Woodcock wrote on Twitter: \u201cDare to question Saint Jeremy\u2019s version of the truth? John McDonnell will strip you of your knighthood ...\u201d Smith said he had not heard about McDonnell\u2019s comments before his LBC interview. He told Andrew Castle: \u201cIt seems a bit much, to be honest. I think he was merely pointing out the reality that Jeremy didn\u2019t need to sit on the floor, so I can\u2019t imagine we would strip somebody\u2019s honours for telling the truth.\u201d Smith used the interview to attack Corbyn\u2019s claim that he didn\u2019t consider himself wealthy, saying the Labour leader\u2019s combined \u00a3138,000 pay packet meant he was \u201cwell and truly in the top 1% in the country\u201d. Smith\u2019s own \u00a370,000 MP\u2019s salary put him in the top 10%, he added, \u201cand I think we have to be realistic about that\u201d. Corbyn should be held responsible for the \u201cuglier\u201d tone of debate in the Labour party, Smith added. \u201cWe\u2019ve had an uglier debate within Labour in the last 11 months than we\u2019ve ever had in my life, and I don\u2019t think Jeremy can escape some of the responsibility for that, as he has been the leader during this period,\u201d he said. Smith said internal polling showed his campaign was \u201cmaking real inroads\u201d against Corbyn in the leadership campaign, adding, \u201cI\u2019m fighting as hard as I can.\u201d",

And you should certainly have it stripped from you if you subsequently have been found to be not acting in the spirit of our country.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"091cebf81098114dd4bd7666445b1558118fe374\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/091cebf81098114dd4bd7666445b1558118fe374/0_220_2628_1577/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Philip Green.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Philip Green.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bobby Yip/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, he said, awards should go to \u201cunsung heroes who keep our public services running, or devote a lifetime to local communities\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesman for McDonnell said: \u201cJohn believes that it should be for parliament to ultimately decide who is or who is not stripped of their title, if enough members of the public campaign for it.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cBut he would not support tax exiles or businessmen who mistreat their employees retaining their titles.\u201d</p> <p>The Labour MP John Woodcock <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JWoodcockMP/status/769612962298523652\">wrote on Twitter</a>: \u201cDare to question Saint Jeremy\u2019s version of the truth?

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sallie Krawcheck\u2019s first \u201ceureka\u201d moment came just before her 30th birthday. She had walked away from her investment banking job, after realizing she had been relegated to working with the firm\u2019s most lackluster senior dealmaker. She was at home with her two children when it hit. \u201cI should be an equity research analyst!\u201d It turned out to be the beginning of one of Wall Street\u2019s storied careers, for one of the tiny handful of women to make it big. Accepting the only job offer she got, from Sanford C Bernstein, in 1995, Krawcheck was its chief executive by 2001. By 2002, Sandy Weill, chief executive of Citigroup, had lured her away to take over as head of Smith Barney. In 2005, she was chief financial officer of Citigroup and tipped to become Wall Street\u2019s first female CEO. Even her high-profile firing following the financial crisis didn\u2019t derail her career: Krawcheck surfaced as the head of the newly merged Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s wealth management division, charged with overseeing the famed \u201cthundering herd\u201d. Then Bank of America\u2019s CEO, Brian Moynihan, possibly threatened by her high profile, offered her a choice between departure or demotion. She chose to leave. The aftermath of that high-stakes Wall Street power struggle led to her next great eureka moment. \u201cThere are different ways to attack the boys\u2019 club than from the inside,\u201d she tells the Guardian. For years after her 2011 \u201cresignation\u201d from Bank of America, Krawcheck debated with herself. She knew being a woman had given her a fundamentally different perspective on the way that Merrill Lynch\u2019s \u201cherd\u201d of largely male brokers and financial advisers did business, a view that had been shaped and refined by her years at Citigroup. \u201cBut I made all the arguments to myself,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were plenty of firms out there already\u201d that could opt to do business in a different way, to serve their clients \u2013 especially women \u2013 better. Except that they didn\u2019t. \u201cI watched and watched,\u201d Krawcheck says. The percentage of financial advisers at big Wall Street firms that were men remained unchanged, about 85%. And that matters, she says, because they didn\u2019t pay much attention to the women among their clientele, even when they thought they did. \u201cWe\u2019d study this, when a male adviser met with a couple, and ask him how much time he thought he spent interacting with each member of them, and he\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, 55/45.\u2019\u201d In fact, the evidence showed he had spent 90% of his time talking to the man, and not realized it. Unsurprisingly, Krawcheck found that when they were widowed, 70% of Merrill\u2019s clients took their assets and left. BMO Wealth Institute calculates that women control about 51% of all personal wealth in the US, or some $14tn, and projects that figure to hit $22tn by 2020. Investment firms cannot afford to disregard women or to lose them as clients. And yet they weren\u2019t hiring women as advisers. \u201cOne firm used a marine corps questionnaire for hiring,\u201d Krawcheck recalls. Since it wasn\u2019t her job to force Wall Street into recognizing what it was doing wrong, she decided to try to start doing it the right way. The first step was the purchase in spring 2013 of 85 Broads, a financial membership and networking community established by alumnae of Goldman Sachs, which she promptly renamed Ellevate Network, to reflect its new mission: to provide more women with a way to become involved and engaged in their finances. Earlier this year, she rolled out the next stage of her plan, Ellevest: an investment platform designed around women\u2019s needs and priorities, not those of the men who run Wall Street and the firms where she cut her teeth. \u201cThe whole icon of a bull that stands for Wall Street \u2013 you couldn\u2019t come up with an image of a more male environment,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen feel that the brand doesn\u2019t speak to them.\u201d They also, she argues, speak a very different language when it comes to money, and have very different objectives, which men don\u2019t grasp at all. To the extent that the big Wall Street firms attempt to cater to women, they \u201cpinkify\u201d their offerings, Krawcheck says. Why, she asks, does a woman-friendly approach to investing \u201chave to mean the junior version? \u201cSomehow there is this feeling that women require remedial financial education and so everything must be dumbed down. The reality is that we all need a lot more education, but guys just go ahead and invest anyway.\u201d \u2018Just friggin\u2019 pay them more\u2019 Krawcheck\u2019s irritation and anger at this kind of systemic bias \u2013 and its impact on women, who end up so alienated by the Wall Street system and so daunted by the difficult of finding a firm or an independent adviser who will listen to them that they simply avoid seeking out the investment advice they need \u2013 creep through her trademark charm and humor. When others suggest that it doesn\u2019t make sense to focus on the investment gender gap because it\u2019s more important to close the gender pay gap first, you can almost hear her grit her teeth before answering. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying you broke your arm and you broke your leg, but I\u2019m not going to fix your broken arm because I can\u2019t fix your broken leg yet!\u201d As far as the gender pay gap itself is concerned, she has no patience at all. \u201cJust friggin\u2019 pay them more\u201d is Krawcheck\u2019s message to companies that still compensate men and women inequitably. \u201cOh, and if you haven\u2019t stopped to check whether you have a gender pay gap? You do.\u201d And now Krawcheck has created a place where those women, tired of testosterone-fueled investment jabber about relative price/earning ratios and the best mid-cap growth mutual fund to pick, can find an investment home. Krawcheck\u2019s Ellevest does not \u201cpinkify\u201d investing, she insists, but it does start the process in a very different way. Ellevest\u2019s objective isn\u2019t to design a portfolio that will beat the market or focus on the exciting investment concept of the day. Instead, the robo-adviser designs portfolios based on the user\u2019s investment time horizon and risk tolerance. \u201cWomen think in terms of goals-based investing,\u201d she explains. It\u2019s slightly pricier than rivals (the fee is 0.5% of assets a year), but cheaper than working with a traditional financial adviser would be. Moreover, as Krawcheck points out, it\u2019s a process designed to ensure that women actually feel that their portfolios and goals are in sync. \u201cWomen value capital preservation many times more than men, but you won\u2019t find that reflected\u201d at Merrill Lynch or anywhere else in the industry, she argues. It\u2019s early days still. If the company thrives, however, there\u2019s no downside: success will give women an alternative to the Merrill Lynches of the world and give the latter a much-overdue wakeup call, the kind that its leaders couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t listen to from inside the walls.

      "bodyText": "Do you remember Y2K? The millennium bug? For the benefit of younger readers, fears grew during the 1990s that, because of how we programmed computers, the dawn of 2000 would lead to catastrophes of all sorts. Planes would fall from the sky and power stations would switch themselves off. Yet precisely nothing happened as we waved goodbye to 1999 and said hello to 2000. When the UK voted to leave the EU, sterling fell sharply and is now 10% below its value in the first three weeks of June. That makes us worse off: it costs more to buy stuff from abroad, whether that\u2019s French cheese or foreign holidays. Already, the effect on business costs is evident with input prices rising in July for the first time since 2013. In an otherwise low inflation environment, many businesses have little pricing power so margins are squeezed. There have also been declines in commercial real estate prices and some property funds erected barriers to people wishing to withdraw money. Little of this is good news. But no economic planes have fallen from the sky and no economic power stations have turned themselves off. On the contrary, while surveys said consumer confidence had collapsed, Britain appears to have spent July at the shops. And we were not browsing: retail sales volumes were 1.4% higher than in June, strong growth by any standard. Surveys also said that hiring had ground to a halt. Yet the number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits fell in July. So will Brexit turn out to have been a latter-day Y2K? Some of the claims of the immediate economic consequences of voting leave have been unfounded, but it is too early to declare peace. Car sales and mortgage applications hint that people are pausing when it comes to big purchases. Among the more reliable surveys, such as that conducted by the Bank of England\u2019s agents, there are signs of businesses taking stock before committing to investment. Economic performance could yet dip. Concerned that the worst would come to pass, the Bank of England has acted decisively. While that will blunt any immediate adverse consequences of the leave vote, the more meaningful effects will happen later and demand a different type of response. The long-term economic challenge of Brexit is that voting for restrictions on migration and limiting access to overseas markets will lead to slower growth than would otherwise have been the case. Trade makes us better off, on average, because it allows companies and countries to focus on what they do best. The threat of competition engendered by trade also keeps businesses on their toes, eking out improvements that lead to faster growth and higher incomes. So Brexit becomes a growth challenge and there is barely an economic problem that cannot substantially be solved by faster productivity growth. One route to consider is more investment: create better assets than we have today and they will generate higher incomes tomorrow. That means not only more money in people\u2019s pockets but could lead to better-funded public services. Especially in an uncertain environment in which businesses might hesitate to invest, there is a role for government. Currently, we are committed to balancing this year\u2019s spending and revenue unless growth is very weak. As part of the reset of fiscal policy, a rule allowing government to borrow for sensible investment while otherwise keeping a tight grip on the public finances would complement the Bank of England\u2019s measures and lay a platform for long-term growth. The National Infrastructure Delivery Plan is replete with sound projects. We know that fixing local road networks and adding to aviation capacity will deliver large benefits. It is essential, too, to invest in people \u2013 especially the very young \u2013 and in innovation in a plan for growth. The vote to leave was partly a rebellion against the adverse effects of trade and open borders: we are better off on average but many people lose. Exiting the EU might slow migration and, thus, the rate of growth of demand for public services and housing. However, migration will not turn negative or the population stop rising. So far, the economic consequences of voting leave have been modest. But the race has not been run. It has only started. Winning that race needs a plan for growth.

      "bodyText": "Autumn statements come and go. Like comets, they blaze across the political sky for a couple of weeks in November and December before disappearing into the inky darkness. By Christmas, they are largely forgotten. This year will be different. For once, it matters what the Treasury cooks up and what would have been a rather mundane affair had George Osborne remained chancellor has become a very big deal indeed. Philip Hammond is the new occupant of 11 Downing Street and he has some big calls to make. Is the economy in need of a post-Brexit boost? If it is, can the job be left solely to the Bank of England? If not, can the Treasury take up the baton and at what cost to the public finances? If so, should the stimulus come from lower taxes or higher spending? The answer to the first question is yes. Growth in the second quarter was reasonably robust at 0.6%, and the indicators since the referendum on 23 June have shown that the economy has held up better than most people anticipated. In part, though, that has been the result of policy action already taken by the Bank of England and by the expectation \u2013 fostered by Hammond \u2013 that there will be more to come in the autumn statement. Some softening in growth can be expected as a result of investment decisions being put on hold. Consumer spending appears to have held up well since Brexit, but there have been no figures yet for private capital expenditure. This was already lower in the second quarter of 2016 than a year earlier, and with uncertainty ratcheted up it is possible that there will be further weakness in the second half of the year. The Bank of England is not best placed to cope with this. If interest rates of 0.5% for the seven years leading up to Brexit have failed to persuade companies to invest, it is hard to imagine that interest rates of 0.25% (or even 0.1%) will any more successful. Keynes called this a liquidity trap: business cannot be persuaded to invest no matter how low interest rates go. It is a classic example of the old saw: you can lead a horse to water but you can\u2019t make it drink. Monetary policy, which is what central banks do, is on the point of exhaustion. Indeed, there are some economists who think perpetually low interest rates and QE are the problem. \u201cIt is not that central banks have failed to reduce interest rates enough,\u201d said the consultancy Fathom last week, \u201cbut that the continued application of emergency monetary policy measures has held back growth in productive potential by enabling barely profitable and increasingly unproductive firms to survive. Low rates encourage zombies. Zombies do not grow.\u201d Apart from in the depths of the 2008-09 global slump, fiscal policy has taken a back seat. Finance ministers have sat back and left it to central banks to sort things out. This looked like a mistake in late 2009-10, when the brief flirtation with Keynesianism gave way to the vogue for austerity, and it looks like an even bigger mistake today. There are two necessary preconditions for a Keynesian stimulus: that private sector investment is being prevented by a high degree of uncertainty, and that monetary policy is played out. Both apply in the post-Brexit world. So, Hammond can make a strong case for an expansionary autumn statement on the grounds that there is a risk to the economy that can be dealt with better by the Treasury than by the Bank of England. The next question is what form that stimulus should take. Hammond has two options: to cut taxes or to increase public spending, or perhaps a combination of both. If Hammond goes down the tax route, a cut in VAT is the obvious choice. The chancellor would hope that cheaper goods and services would encourage consumer spending and so limit the risk of the economy sliding into recession. There are, though, drawbacks with this approach. For a start, it is expensive; cutting the main VAT rate from 20% to 17.5% would cost the exchequer \u00a314bn a year. There is also no guarantee that consumers would spend the windfall; they might simply save more. And if consumer spending does increase as a result of a VAT cut, the upshot is likely to be higher imports and a bigger balance of payments deficit. The final reason to be wary of a VAT cut is that boosting consumption is a lower priority than raising investment. And if the problem is that the private sector is not investing, it makes sense for the Treasury to boost public investment. Some of the arguments always mustered against higher state investment can be easily countered. Hammond would not be competing against the private sector for the funds available for investment. There would be no \u201ccrowding out\u201d if the Treasury borrowed more, because the private sector has made it abundantly clear over the past decade that it has a propensity not to invest. Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC, puts it this way: \u201cIn the current environment, the case for public investment is compelling. Interest rates can\u2019t go any lower, uncertainty is extreme and borrowing is cheap.\u201d What\u2019s more, the economy is suffering from obvious supply-side deficiencies that would be eased by higher investment: passenger numbers on the trains have doubled in the past 15 years while spending on railway infrastructure has remained flat as a share of GDP; there is no nationwide superfast broadband; there is a looming energy crisis caused by power stations reaching the end of their lives; the UK spends less on infrastructure than any G7 nation apart from the US; there is an acute shortage of new housing that is leading to excessively high property inflation and impeding labour mobility. All in all, Hammond is spoilt for choice. Public investment is a better option for a stimulus than a VAT cut because it provides assets for the future, improves the economy\u2019s long-term growth potential, and generates a stream of income that ensures the investment pays for itself. The deficit, currently 4% of GDP, will rise in the short term but come down over time. Boosting public investment is not without its problems for the government. Despite all the talk about shovel-ready projects, it would take time for extra spending on infrastructure to show up in the growth figures. There are two other difficulties. One is public opposition to new railways and housing. So-called BANANAism (build absolutely nothing anywhere near anyone) is strong. The other is that the construction sector has a massive problem with skill shortages and the only realistic way to find the workers to build the new homes and lay the new tracks would be to import them from overseas.",

Most central bankers are well aware that their black bag of monetary medicine is running short of remedies to overcome the continuing aftershocks of the 2008 crash. Brexit is the latest seismic convulsion. And the Bank of England duly handed out the financial equivalent of blue, yellow and pink pills to soothe the fevered brows of consumers and businesses alike. It\u2019s true, as Brexiters contend, that the dire warnings of the International Monetary Fund and George Osborne\u2019s Treasury that Britain\u2019s economy would fall off a cliff in the event of a vote to leave the European Union have been proved wrong. It was always unlikely the vote would trigger a repeat of 2008, which was a global financial collapse that dragged the entire developed world down with it. Remainers might want to put their head in the sand, but the vote itself has not caused a 20% drop in property prices or most of the other scary things on the roster of gloomy predictions. But it is also true that the bounceback in consumer spending and business activity has only recovered some of the ground lost over the preceding six months. More than that, the recovery is largely a result of the devalued pound and the Bank of England\u2019s promise to stimulate the economy with another adrenaline shot. In the same vein as European Central Bank president Mario Draghi\u2019s \u201cready to do whatever it takes\u201d speech in the summer of 2012, which soothed the nerves of eurozone investors as Athens burned, the Bank of England made it clear in February, as soon as the vote was called by David Cameron, that it stood ready to give the economy a boost, and duly delivered on 4 August. A cut in the base rate to 0.25%, an extra \u00a360bn of quantitative easing and \u00a3100bn of cheap loans for banks to offset the squeeze from low interest rates was heavily trailed by the Bank\u2019s governor Mark Carney, albeit in the vaguest terms, giving a measure of comfort that a repeat of 2008 could be avoided. The real problem for Carney is that Brexit hasn\u2019t happened yet. And while David Davis and Liam Fox may yet carve out trade deals for the UK that boost trade, the betting is that in an era of globalisation and the domination of powerful trading blocs, the UK is going to struggle to attract international businesses bringing new jobs. Most forecasts have reduced the average growth rate over the next four years from above 2% to below 2%. If that turns out to be true, the UK will need a bit more stimulus to help it through. What does the Bank of England have to offer? What about negative interest rates? Neither the UK or US have allowed their central bank to charge customers \u2013 mostly commercial banks \u2013 to keep funds on deposit in the way that the ECB and Bank of Japan already do. Adam Posen, the former Bank interest-rate setter who is now in charge at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, has urged his former colleagues and the Fed to put aside their reluctance and adopt negative rates. In his defence Carney can cite warnings from the central bankers\u2019 club, the Geneva-based Bank of International Settlements, which worries that negative interest rates will hit commercial bank profits hard and undermine their ability to make loans. Robert Shapiro, a former economic adviser to Bill Clinton and head of the Sonecon consultancy in Washington, says the only reason the Fed is considering an increase in rates is to regain some firepower before the next recession. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve had three quarters of annual growth at around 1%, inflation is low and productivity is around 1% when it should be above 2%, there is still more work to do,\u201d he says. Like many, he wants governments to use low interest rates to fund infrastructure spending and investments in schools and training. He despairs at Hillary Clinton\u2019s $275bn investment plan, which is fully funded from tax rises and savings in government spending. This money should be borrowed at the current ultra-cheap rates \u2013 not least because a policy of ever-cheaper credit is not going to raise productivity. Only an injection of new, freshly minted funds that add to the sum of money in circulation, invested wisely, can do that. Carney and Draghi have argued this case, only for politicians to take a step back. Stanley Fischer, deputy Fed chief, made the same point before this weekend\u2019s meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Unfortunately, month by month, the situation is getting more desperate. Three business confidence surveys do not make a trend, but the pessimism registered by Belgian, French and German firms last week could force the ECB to consider further action before its 8 September meeting. The Bank of England may need to follow suit, however reluctantly, as the post-Brexit fall in sterling pushes up inflation while wages remain stagnant, cutting living standards and growth. The final nail in the coffin would be a rise in US rates, triggering a rush of funds across the Atlantic, forcing the pound down further and inflation higher. Carney would be forced to switch tack, raising rates to stem the flow. Then he wouldn\u2019t need to worry about the colour of his remedy pills: just the looming recession he will surely be blamed for.",

      "bodyText": "When flight schedules go wrong, they go horribly wrong. Terminals become chaotic, with long-delayed and increasingly dishevelled passengers spread all over the concourse. There are queues for \u20ac5 vouchers to join other queues for overpriced food. Tempers get frayed. This correspondent once spent 13 very unhappy hours in a sweaty Palma de Mallorca airport waiting for a flight to transport us to the relative luxury of Luton. Delays such as these are why the EU introduced its flight compensation rules. Brussels declared that when flights arrive at their final destination three hours or more late, the passenger is eligible for \u20ac250-\u20ac600 in compensation, depending on the distance flown. They were cited by some as a reason to vote to remain in the EU. Since the EU261 rules came into force, the airlines have spent much of their time trying to wriggle out of them, as the Observer has highlighted. Many will define routine problems as \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to avoid paying refunds. Online applications are made deliberately obtuse in the hope that frustrated applicants will give up along the way. And many do. But, while newspapers traditionally campaign for consumer rights, could it be that the compensation awards (we\u2019ll whisper this very quietly) are just a bit too generous? Take, for example, a colleague recently back from the Costa Dorada this summer. His Ryanair flight from Barcelona to London was delayed for more than three hours. He has since obtained \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3853) compensation for himself, wife and two children. How much did he pay for those flights? Less than \u00a3400. He feels like he has been given a free holiday. The same colleague flew British Airways from Heathrow to Hawaii last year for a once-in-a-lifetime treat with the family. That flight was also delayed, by just over three hours, and because it was more than 3,500km, they qualified for the big one: \u20ac600 compensation per person. The family picked up \u20ac2,400 (just under \u00a32,000 at the time) from BA. Not quite the whole cost of the tickets, but not far off. You may be left thinking: \u201cI wish I got delayed like that.\u201d Passengers delayed for two-and-a-half hours often find themselves praying the delay will go on for at least another 30 minutes. If they were in America, they wouldn\u2019t be. The US has no formal compensation rules for flight delays. Travellers can be delayed 24 hours on a flight from LA to Manchester and receive nothing, but they can pick up \u00a3500 if they are held up for three hours flying in the opposite direction. The EU261 rules are designed to knock the airlines into shape, and keep delays to a minimum, argue their proponents. These proponents include an increasing number of lawyers keen to snaffle a one-third cut of any \u201caward\u201d from the airline. Back in 2014, easyJet complained that \u201cpaying compensation far in excess of the fare price places a huge financial burden on us as an airline and will ultimately lead to higher fares for all.\u201d The average ticket at easyJet costs \u00a361.93, and half of all sold are below \u00a350. That means the airline has to pay around three times the ticket revenue it receives when there is a delay. Curiously, the airlines were reluctant when the Observer reached out for comment on this issue. They don\u2019t want to appear to be campaigning against consumer rights. But, off the record, their dissatisfaction with the rules is intense \u2013 and understandable. Limiting compensation just to the fare price may make them a little too sloppy when it comes to avoiding delays. But mightn\u2019t it be fairer to repay travellers their ticket price, plus a set fee, such as \u20ac50 or \u20ac100? Still generous, but not excessive. And we need to be thinking about this, because it\u2019s one of those many EU rules which we may have to renegotiate on Brexit. Could there be an \u2018Opec for news\u2019? Finding a way to give newspapers a slug of the advertising cash they have lost to Google is one of those old-media dreams that won\u2019t die. There have been many attempts, most recently in Germany and Spain, but they have all failed. The European commission, we learned on Thursday, is hatching the latest cunning plan. A draft working paper sets out options for a new law. Publishers will have an exclusive right to make their content available to the public and to reproduce it for digital purposes. The intention is to create a better regulatory tool to extract licensing payments from services like Google News. Legislation on its own will change nothing. Publicly funded organisations like the BBC may choose not to demand a fee. And Google could simply stop displaying articles from those who want to charge. The effects can be devastating: when the publisher of Bild, Germany\u2019s biggest tabloid, tried to enforce licensing fees in 2014, its traffic dropped by 80% in two weeks. For licensing to work, news groups will have to act collectively. The creation of Opec in the 1960s transformed the fortunes of oil nations, redressing the balance of power with western-owned oil firms. Should Europe form an Opec for news? Political support for a fightback is at fever pitch in France and Germany, but has been lacking so far in the UK. David Cameron\u2019s links to Google were close. Theresa May, on the other hand, spent years at the Home Office pushing for search engines and social media to take down links to extremist material. She may not be such a fan. But Google is really the wrong target. For many, Facebook is now their primary news source. Publishers voluntarily upload their journalism for free on the platform, where it is then shared between users. The commission\u2019s proposed licensing rights probably wouldn\u2019t apply to the Facebook model. Obtaining fair payment for Europe\u2019s journalistic black gold looks set to remain a pipe dream. A new chancellor should face up to old poverty statistics What does a government do when the numbers stop going its way? Stop publishing the numbers, of course. That\u2019s how it looked when former chancellor George Osborne ditched the Treasury\u2019s analysis of how his budgets affected the very poorest and the richest in Britain. Instead, after the Conservatives\u2019 election victory, an inferior substitute of this \u201cdistributional analysis\u201d was concocted. Rather than looking at 10 income groups, it covered just five \u2013 so the impact of austerity on the very poorest was no longer clear. Instead of showing what households actually received, the new model showed changes in the share of public spending received. The newer analysis also projected future effects, not how households were faring in the present. Now Andrew Tyrie MP, chair of the Treasury select committee, is asking the new chancellor Philip Hammond to revert to the old, more transparent analysis. In a government that pledges to create \u201ca country that works not for a privileged few, but for every one of us\u201d, let\u2019s hope Hammond listens.",
