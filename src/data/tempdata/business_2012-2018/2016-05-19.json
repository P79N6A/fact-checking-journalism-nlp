      "bodyText": "Households will be paying \u00a3100 more for their annual bills within five years to fund four government policies designed to keep the lights on and support low-carbon electricity, according to a review. Independent consultancy Cornwall Energy said energy subsidies will have risen by 124% by 2020-21 due to the cost of the capacity market, renewable obligations, contracts for difference and feed-in tariff schemes. The cost estimates will anger Conservative backbenchers opposed to subsidising green energy, even if it is designed to play a key role in the fight against climate change. \u201cWhile the future path of wholesale prices remains uncertain, policy costs are moving only in one direction,\u201d said Jo Butlin, the managing director of Cornwall. \u201cOur research shows a confluence of factors serving to push these costs up notably in the next couple of years, though important drivers that could yet change the outlook remain beyond anyone\u2019s control.\u201d Cornwall estimates that three of the renewable energy subsidies, excluding the capacity market energy security scheme, will have cost \u00a37.7bn by 2020 \u2013 \u00a3100m more than the spending limit of the levy control framework. The figure compares with an estimated \u00a31.5bn overspend predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility last July. The government said it had taken various steps to reduce the burden on customer bills in the past 12 months. A spokesperson for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \u201cThrough the halting of subsidies for onshore wind in the [2013] Energy Act, to added competition driving down costs in contract for difference auctions and the capacity market, our actions have shown that we will be tough on subsidies in order to keep bills down for our families and businesses, and ensure value for money.\u201d The cost of energy has long been a source of friction between providers and consumers, although some retail bills have been cut by suppliers over the past 12 months, albeit on the back of lower wholesale commodity prices. SSE, one of the big six energy companies, was criticised after it announced on Wednesday that it had kept annual retail profits steady at \u00a3455m, despite losing 370,000 customers to lower-cost competitors. National Grid, which operates pipes and pylons in England and Wales, reported on Thursday that pre-tax profits were up by 15% to \u00a33bn in the year to March. Last autumn, energy regulator Ofgem said the average dual fuel domestic bill was \u00a31,345. While Labour MPs have generally supported the green subsidies needed to support the development of solar and wind farms, the capacity market has been heavily criticised. Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy secretary, said the scheme to encourage energy companies to keep their power plants online to meet periods of peak demand was a \u201cmassive waste of money\u201d. This was because previous payments had ended up going to nuclear facilities and other plants that would have stayed open regardless, or funded carbon-heavy diesel generators, she said.",

      "bodyText": "Bang, there goes 100 points off the FTSE 100. Suddenly, the index is within 60 points of 6,000, a level last seen in late-February, which was roughly when investors recovered from their new year fretfulness and decided the gloom, perhaps, had been overdone. But memories of January\u2019s wobble are fresh and here\u2019s the US Federal Reserve with a reminder of how the alarm came about in the first place. Interest rates could rise next month, according to the latest minutes. An increase is far from being a done deal \u2013 a one-third chance, according to the futures prices \u2013 but September had previously been seen as the moment. In theory, June or September should make little difference. We\u2019re only talking about a quarter-point rise, to follow an increase of the same size last December, so US rates will be low whatever happens. And the Fed will only move if it thinks the US economy is sufficiently strong. Yet it would be wrong to dismiss an early US increase as a fuss about nothing. Relative calm was restored to markets in March when the dollar started to weaken. That eased the pressure on those overextended companies in emerging markets that have foolishly borrowed in dollars. China has been able to get a grip on the renminbi, which was a major source of worry in January. And oil \u2013 priced in dollars \u2013 has risen from $27 a barrel in January to $47 today, creating headroom for under-the-cosh producers like Russia. In short, a weaker dollar has made investors feel better about the world. A US rate rise threatens to undo that work if it forces the dollar higher again. If the oil price slips, corporate bond markets \u2013 and banks \u2013 will again be fretting about defaults by overborrowed US shale producers. Any recurrence of turmoil in China would be taken particularly badly; some China-watchers argue Beijing is waiting for a good moment to devalue the renminbi properly in an attempt to restore competitiveness to an economy that continues to slow. If that were to happen, the currency wars of the past few years would look like minor skirmishes. Meanwhile, the big-picture backdrop for the global economy looks as uninspiring as in January. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund says prospects have become slightly worse \u2013 at the start of the year it was expecting global growth of 3.4% this year but its latest forecasts say 3.2%, little better than the 3.1% of 2015. It is possible, of course, that markets come to view a US rate rise in June as cheerful news \u2013 a sign that the world\u2019s biggest economy is getting stronger. But that\u2019s not the way to bet. The potential of a stronger dollar to cause havoc in the rest of the world remains an underlying obsession. Do not be surprised if markets stage a tantrum in the run-up to June\u2019s vote: it\u2019s the traditional way to scare the Fed into backing off. Life\u2019s no beach for Thomas Cook There was no profits warning, just an admission this year\u2019s outcome may only match last year\u2019s. And the first-half performance, if anything, was slightly better than the City had feared. Yet Thomas Cook\u2019s shares fell 19%. The EgyptAir plane crash was one obvious explanation. But it also looks as if investors have underestimated the scale of the \u201cmarket disruption,\u201d as Thomas Cook puts it, for holiday companies. In Turkey, which used to be the firm\u2019s second biggest market, capacity has been cut by a third, with most of the reductions ordered after the Istanbul bombings in January. Even so, in the middle of May, Thomas Cook faces the daunting prospect of finding 1 million customers to take a summer holiday in Turkey. Meanwhile, Egypt and Tunisia are off-limits and there is a scramble to find hotels in Spain, Bulgaria and Greece. In the circumstances, chief executive Peter Fankhauser\u2019s claim of \u201csignificant progress\u201d in the six months to March was fair. Underlying losses (inevitable in the first half in a seasonal business) were reduced by a 10th. He hopes Thomas Cook, still burdened with too much debt, can return to paying dividends this year. Good luck with that, but you can\u2019t blame investors for feeling they\u2019ll believe it when they see it. Walmart holds fire over poor Asda performance One theory holds that Asda\u2019s sales are so weak that it\u2019s only a matter of time before US parent Walmart orders its UK off-shoot to launch a price war to combat the discount menace of Aldi and Lidl. Asda\u2019s numbers are certainly poor \u2013 like-for-like sales have now fallen for seven quarters in a row. But the idea that Walmart is preparing to roll out the heavy guns doesn\u2019t fit with the tone from the top. Asda was deemed worthy of only a single paragraph in the tour of the global empire. Walmart sounds merely bored by Asda, rather than ready to fund a price war.",

      "bodyText": "A top Bank of England policymaker has warned that even if Britain votes to stay in the EU, underlying weakness in the economy could mean that more support is required from the Bank. Jan Vlieghe, one of the nine policymakers who vote on interest rates, has previously floated the idea of them being cut below zero. Speaking on Thursday, he again raised the prospect of rates coming down further from their record low of 0.5%, when he said the economy could require \u201cadditional monetary stimulus\u201d if it does not rebound after a remain vote in the EU referendum on 23 June. In a speech at the London Business School, Vlieghe echoed the words of his colleagues on the monetary policy committee (MPC) in saying that the referendum was making it harder to gauge the underlying state of the UK economy, which has slowed in recent months. \u201cThe challenge for the committee is that we do not know how much of the slowing in growth is due to the referendum, an effect that should be short lived, and how much of it reflects a more fundamental loss of underlying momentum, which might be more persistent.\u201d Following a vote to remain, Vlieghe said he expected economic activity to pick up as the spending delayed until after the referendum by households and businesses kicks back in. However, he added that he would want to see \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d of an improvement in the economic outlook. \u201cIf such improvement is not apparent soon, this will reduce my confidence that inflation is likely to return to the target within an acceptable time horizon, without additional monetary stimulus,\u201d Vlieghe said. In an answer to a question after his speech, he said rate cuts and more quantitative easing should be among the options if the UK economy needs more support from the Bank. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, drew criticism from some campaigners for the UK to leave the EU last week, when he said an out vote could tip the economy into recession. Presenting quarterly forecasts, Carney said it was the Bank\u2019s job to outline risks to the economy and financial system. But his critics said he had overstepped his remit and strayed into politics. In his speech, Vlieghe repeated the Brexit scenario set out by the MPC last week: a dip in activity and a pickup in inflation as the pound falls. Talking about the challenges for policymakers from a leave vote, he said: \u201cGiven significant uncertainty about the future of the UK\u2019s trading relationships, a meaningful drop in domestic demand and in the exchange rate is possible. For some time, the productive potential of the UK economy might also decline as the economy adjusts to new trading relationships and investment patterns. \u201cThe UK is therefore likely to experience lower growth and higher inflation for a period, as a weaker exchange rate pushes up import prices.\u201d Like his MPC colleagues, Vlieghe would not predict how policymakers might respond to a leave vote. The MPC made it clear last week that whether the Bank cuts, holds or raises interest rates after a Brexit would depend on the extent of the changes to growth and inflation. The bulk of his speech was about long-term interest rates, as opposed to the overnight base rate set by the Bank, and why they had been so low for such a long time in the UK and elsewhere. Vlieghe suggested that low long-term rates reflected confidence among investors that central bankers would continue to set monetary policy to keep inflation and the wider economy on track. \u201cThe reason expected future real rates are low is that monetary policy has responded and is expected to continue to respond appropriately to persistent forces weighing on demand and inflation. Interest rates are low because that is what the economy needs in order to keep inflation expectations anchored,\u201d he said. Vlieghe also raised the prospect of decades of low borrowing costs. \u201cPersistent effects from debt de-leveraging, demographic shifts and changes in the distribution of income have created an environment where a given level of growth might be consistent with substantially lower interest rates than in the past. This environment might persist for years, even decades,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "Markets hit by fears of US June rate hike \u2013\u00a0as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The increasing fear that the US Federal Reserve could raise interest rates next month, earlier than expected, has sent global markets tumbling. Following Wednesday\u2019s more hawkish than expected Fed minutes, a number of the central bank\u2019s key figures have lined up to suggest the June meeting is \u201clive\u201d in terms of a possible rate hike. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Anxiety is setting in for financial markets, as the proposition of another rate hike from the Fed draws the bears out once more. Today\u2019s US open has seen the Dow crash to a two month low, bringing the FTSE down with it as rate sensitive banks benefit at the expense of the wider market. The US dollar strength continues to be a running theme, as energy, metal and materials producers suffer at the hands of a yet another sea of red for the sector. Yesterday\u2019s Fed minutes provided the latest clue that perhaps a June rate hike may not be such a crazy idea, with the markets now factoring in a 32% chance of action. This shift from 4% on Monday to 32% today goes a long way to explain the substantial rise in the US dollar this week. With a hawkish Fed and a three year high in US CPI, the potential implications of a strong jobs report in June is starting to click in the minds of investors. With the dollar rising on the interest rate outlook, commodity prices fell back, including copper hitting a three month low and Brent crude losing 1% to $48.33. So mining companies were among the leading fallers, as were travel companies in the wake of a disappointing update from Thomas Cook and the disappearance of a flight from Paris to Cairo. But banks benefited from hopes that any US rate rise would support their balance sheets. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 112.45 points or 1.82% to 6053.35, its biggest one day percentage fall since early February Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.48% to 9795.89 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.85% at 4282.54 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.95% to 17,545.56 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.14% lower at 8674.7 In Greece, the Athens market fell 0.96% to 622.28 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 140 points or 0.8%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. If the US Federal Reserve is considering raising interest rates, then the Bank of England may be heading in the opposite direction. Katie Allen reports: A top Bank of England policymaker has warned that even if Britain votes to stay in the EU, underlying weakness in the economy could require more support from the central bank. Jan Vlieghe, one of the nine policymakers who vote on interest rates, has previously floated the idea of them being cut below zero. Speaking on Thursday, he again raised the prospect of rates coming down further from their record low of 0.5%, when he said the economy could require \u201cadditional monetary stimulus\u201d if it does not rebound after a remain vote in the EU referendum on 23 June. Helena also reports that Handelsblatt, the German financial daily, says lenders may agree to give Greece a much large tranche of bailout aid once the reform package is passed than earlier thought. \u201cInstead of the scheduled \u20ac5.7bn, the ailing country could receive \u20ac9bn to \u20ac11bn.\u201d That would be enough to keep it solvent until the end of the year - both delaying another potentially explosive financial review and allowing lenders to sort out their own differences over how to deal with Greece\u2019s staggering \u20ac321bn debt load But while politically expedient, senior Athens-based EU diplomats also admit that it does not resolve the underlying problem of Greece\u2019s economic fundamentals simply not adding up. More from Athens where a war of words has broken out on the first day of debate over the controversial omnibus bill the government has brought to parliament outlining the latest reforms the country must take. Helena Smith reports: At 7,500 pages the omnibus bill was never going to be passed lightly. And MPs, faced with the daunting task of reading it, have ensured that debate has got off to a tumultuous start. Highlighting the explosive mood, the former prime minister Antonis Samaras accused the leftist-led government of legislating practically everything it had ever denounced. \u201cIt is increasing Enfia [property tax] that it said it would abolish \u2026 and heating oil which we reduced,\u201d said the ex-conservative leader listing the various levies his successor Alexis Tsipras has agreed to raise in return for further bailout funds. \u201cAnd the worst thing: we brought results. Now they [creditors] don\u2019t believe [Athens] will bring results. And that is why they are imposing an automatic fiscal brake,\u201d he added referring to the mechanism that will trigger automatic across-the-board cuts in the event of Greek finances veering off course. Since being replaced by Tsipras in January 2015, Samaras has made few public interventions. In a caustic statement released in the last ten minutes, Tsipras\u2019 office said: \u201cSamaras should speak publicly more often so that citizens can remember his time in power when the country\u2019s GDP was destroyed [fell] by 25 %.\u201d Opposition parties are describing the fiscal break as amounting to the enforcement of a fourth bailout for a populace already hit by runaway unemployment and poverty. On the eve of the debate beginning, the finance ministry announced that the mechanism would not be included in the omnibus bill but would be tabled \u201cas an amendment\u201d at a later date. Insiders admit they cannot agree with lenders over the cuts that will be made should it be activated next year. And, given the falls seen in stock markets since Wednesday\u2019s more hawkish than expected Federal Reserve minutes: Back with the Fed, and New York Fed president William Dudley has added more comments about possible rate rises. He has echoed the comments elsewhere that June is a live meeting, and that the Fed believes markets were underestimating the probability of a rate rise. He said a June or July move was a reasonable expectation, if his forecasts for the way the US economy is going appear on track. But again, he added that the risk of the UK leaving the EU was one that needed to be considered, and the probability of Brexit will influence the Fed\u2019s decision. Over to Greece, and the International Monetary Fund has said debt relief negotiations for the country need to focus on extended maturity periods and very low interest rates. The IMF reportedly wanted a halt to Greek debt repayments until 2040, but spokesman Gerry Rice would not confirm this in his regular news briefing. But he said (quote from Reuters): We have exchanged preliminary views with our partners on general principles regarding debt relief. We believe that it is possible to restore debt sustainability without upfront haircuts, although this would involve providing very concessional loan terms, including long grace and maturity periods and very low interest rates. The Greek parliament is due to vote on the latest series of reform measures over the weekend, ahead of the latest Eurogroup meeting next Tuesday. New York Federal Reserve president William Dudley has repeated that interest rate changes are very much dependent on the economic data at the time. In a speech confirming the Fed\u2019s desire to help households and businesses understand how the economy is progressing and how that helps determine the Fed\u2019s decisions, he said: When asked about the trajectory for the monetary policy stance, I always point out that it is data dependent. The Federal Open Market Committee calibrates the stance of monetary policy to best achieve our twin objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable employment, taking into account our forecast for how the economy is evolving. This forecast reflects the ongoing flow of the data. Data releases that are close to our expectations have little additional impact on the forecast, while data releases that deviate significantly from our expectations can lead to more significant revisions of the forecast. It is, therefore, important for market participants and households to be able to follow the data along with the FOMC and to understand how we are likely to interpret and react to incoming data. The market fall is accelerating as Wall Street\u2019s losses increase, following the suggestion from the US Federal Reserve minutes that a June rate rise could be on the cards. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 159 points or 0.9%, while Germany\u2019s Dax has dropped 1.2% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 0.58%. In the UK the FTSE 100 is 110 points lower at 6055, a fall of 1.7%. The prospect of a US rate hike as early as June has helped push American markets lower at the start of trading. With the oil price also falling - West Texas Intermediate is down around 2% at $47.15 a barrel - the Dow Jones Industrial Average has slipped 51 points or 0.32%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both opened around 0.4% lower. Another Fed speaker, in the form of vice chairman Stanley Fischer, but there appear to be few clues to the next rate hike in his comments. In a speech - entitled (Money), Interest and Prices: Patinkin and Woodford - at an economics conference in New York, he said: Faster trend growth would increase the long-run equilibrium interest rate, and what we need most, now that we are near full employment and approaching our target inflation rate, is faster potential growth. [The equilibrium rate is the level of borrowing costs associated with stable inflation and full employment, according to Reuters]. New York Federal Reserve president William Dudley is due to speak in an hour or so. There is a strong case for the US to raise interest rates in June, but there might be grounds to wait until July after the UK\u2019s EU referendum, according to Richmond Federal Reserve president Jeffery Lacker. Lacker, a notable hawk but non-voting member at the moment, told Bloomberg Radio that a vote for the UK to leave the EU posed risks to the UK and Europe and could spill over to the US. He said the markets took the wrong signal from the Fed\u2019s decision to leave rates on hold at its last two meetings, overestimating how likely it was to leave rates unchanged in future. Lacker said he was comfortable with four rate rises this year, and had supported an increase at April\u2019s meeting. Meanwhile, there are only tenuous signs of growth according to the latest Philadephia Federal Reserve survey. The current business conditions index came in at -1.8 in May compared to -1.6 in the previous month, and the consensus of +3.5. The Fed said: Firms responding to the Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey continued to report tenuous growth this month. The indicator for general activity was essentially unchanged in May and remained slightly negative. Other broad indicators also reflected general weakness in business conditions. The indicator for employment improved but remained negative. Manufacturers\u2019 forecasts of future activity tempered slightly from last month, overall, but continue to suggest confidence in future growth. It concluded: The survey\u2019s indicators for general activity, new orders, shipments, and employment all remained negative. Though indicators for future conditions fell from last month, expectations for future growth continue to be positive. Here are the weekly jobless claims: Another sign of the strength of the US economy - and therefore another sign that the Federal Reserve may want to raise interest rates next month - has come from the weekly jobless claims. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefit fell by 16,000 to 278,000 last week, although analysts had been expecting a decline to 275,000. Still, the weekly rate has been below 300,000 for 63 weeks in a row, a sign of the strong jobs market. The previous week\u2019s claims had been at a 14 month high. Commenting on the minutes, economist Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: The account of the 20-21 April policy meeting reinforces belief that the ECB is firmly in \u201cwait and see mode\u201d following March\u2019s delivery of a major package of stimulative measures. However, the minutes do indicate that the ECB is prepared to eventually act again if deemed necessary. The account also brings out the ECB\u2019s determination to strongly defend itself from recent intensified German criticism over its highly expansionary policy. The European Central Bank has followed the Fed\u2019s lead, and just released the minutes of its own April meeting. But rather than hint at rate hikes, the ECB is firing a warning shot at some of its critics, particularly in Germany. The minutes state: \u201cThere was general agreement that there was a need to counter the perception that monetary policy could no longer contribute to a return of inflation (to the ECB\u2019s target).\u201d \u201cIn light of recent public criticism...in a Member State, it was viewed as important to reaffirm collectively the independence of the ECB in the pursuit of its mandate.\u201d That independence looked under threat last month, when German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble blamed the ECB for fuelling the popularity of the anti-immigrant, eurosceptic Alternative for Deutschland party. ECB chief Mario Draghi, though, slapped down such criticism at his April press conference -- pointing out that undermining the ECB simply hampered its ability to drag Europe\u2019s economy forwards. The minutes also show that the ECB is in \u2018wait and see\u2019 mode, having announced new stimulus measures in March. It cautions that: \u201cpatience was needed for the measures to fully unfold over time in terms of output and inflation\u201d. And the governing council also urged Europe\u2019s politicians to do more, saying they: \u201cstrongly reiterated the need for other policy areas to contribute much more decisively.\u201d The minutes are online here. The old advice to \u2018sell in May and go away\u2019 worked quite well in 2015 \u2013 if you timed your entry back into the market right. It\u2019s exactly a year since the Dow Jones hits its record high - closing at 18,312 points. It then suffered quite a dive in August, due to worries over China. And although it then recovered, it then suffered another selloff around new year before reviving again.... Last night it closed at 17,526, 4% lower than a year ago: Over in Frankfurt, ECB chief Mario Draghi will be breaking out the best Prosecco. The euro has just hit a seven week low against the US dollar, as the greenback continues to benefit from the Fed\u2019s hawkishness. A weaker euro should help to drag Europe\u2019s inflation rate away from zero, and help exporters too.... Oh dear.... Asda, Wal-Mart\u2019s UK operation, has endured another shocking few months. Like-for-like sales across Asda\u2019s stores slumped by 5.7% in the first quarter of 2016. That\u2019s only slightly better than the 5.8% drop in the final quarter of 2015. Clearly the price-wars and heavy competition in Britain\u2019s supermarkets isn\u2019t letting up... Shares in supermarket giant Wal-Mart just jumped by 5% in pre-market trading, after it released better-than-expected results. Wal-Mart posted earnings of $0.98 per share, compared to estimate of $0.88 per share. Revenues also beat forecasts: Wall Street is expected to join the selloff when it opens at 2.30pm BST (9.30am East Coast time) The Dow Jones is currently being called down 71 points, or around 0.4%, at 17454. But there is some US data due in the next coouple of hours to maybe shift the mood. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Whilst Europe has seen a nasty US rate-hike chatter-inspired decline this morning (the DAX and CAC joining the FTSE with 1.5% and 0.9% plunges respectively), the Dow futures aren\u2019t quite as calamitous just yet. It looks like the US index will open just shy of half a percent lower after the bell, but with Philly Fed manufacturing index and jobless claims figures to come before the session begins. There are also speeches this afternoon from Fed vice-chair William Dudley and FOMC member Stanley Fischer, with investors likely keen to hear their take on the chances of a June rate-hike. Despite the hawkish tone of last night\u2019s minutes, most economists don\u2019t actually expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month. Derivatives traders are now pricing in a 32% probability that the Fed hikes rates at its June 14-15 meeting. That\u2019s up from 4% last week. Some analysts believe the Fed will be reluctant to move, just a week before the UK\u2019s EU referendum. Policymakers may also want to hold off until they receive growth figures for the second quarter of 2016, in July. The team at RBC Capital Markets believe the Fed is signalling its ability to hike, rather than actually setting the scene for action in June. Here\u2019s some more views: After three hours of trading, the FTSE 100 is in full-blown retreat - down almost 90 points or 1.4% at 6079. Mining stocks continue to lead the fallers, with Fresnillo, Anglo American and BHP Billiton all down around 5%. Royal Dutch Shell has shed 4.5%, due to the oil price dropping back to $47.70 per barrel today. And Royal Mail have dropped 4%, after reporting a 33% drop in pre-tax profits in a \u2018challenging\u2019 market. Chris Beauchamp, Senior Market Analyst at IG, blames \u201ca hawkish set of Fed minutes and poor results from a number of firms\u201d for today\u2019s selloff. The Fed has put the market on notice for June, and for the moment the market doesn\u2019t like it. Equities have sold off heavily this morning as investors scramble to reallocate funds towards those areas likely to benefit from rising rates in the US \u2013 namely the US dollar, Treasuries and also US bank stocks. As a result, the rug has been pulled from underneath European markets, with the news of the EgyptAir tragedy having an impact on airline and travel names. The battle over Britain\u2019s EU referendum has switched to that dinner party favourite - house prices. Moodys, the rating agency, has predicted this morning that first-time homebuyers in the UK would benefit from a vote to leave the EU. They argue that prices would fall following a Brexit vote, and there could also be less competition for housing. Buy-to-let landlords could also suffer from lower demand, particularly in London if the capital became less attractive to citizens from overseas. The National Association of Estate Agents also believes that house prices would be hit by a Brexit vote. It reckons homeowners in London could lose as much as \u00a37,500, while homes elsewhere in the UK could lose \u00a32,300. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the rise in UK consumer spending last month is reassuring: \u2018The UK economy\u2019s glass was beginning to look decidedly half-empty, so today\u2019s retail sales figures are a welcome tonic to the gloomy economic mood. Diminishing confidence ahead of the EU referendum and weak pay growth were expected to take a toll on retail sales. Indeed market researcher GfK\u2019s consumer sentiment indicator hit a 15-month low in April, which looked ominous for today\u2019s figures, but in the event fears that the referendum would have a negative impact on consumer spending proved unfounded. The pound has hit a three and a half-month high against the euro. Sterling has hit \u20ac1.305, up from \u20ac1.301 last night, thanks to those strong retail sales figures. Here come the latest UK retail sales figures....and they\u2019ve smashed forecasts! The amount of stuff bought in the shops last month jumped by 4.3% compared with a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics reports. Sales volumes were also 1.3% higher than a month earlier. There\u2019s no sign of pre-Brexit jitters here. Instead, shoppers may have been spurred into action by the fact that average shop prices have fallen by 2.8% over the last year. Sales of most items jumped, but there was a 6.3% drop in clothing turnover. That may be due to cold weather in April, which put people off from buying summer garments. Melanie Richard, ONS Head of Retail Sales, said: \u201cClothing stores remain the main drag on growth in the retail sector, with sales hampered by unseasonal weather. However, both the volume and value of sales increased in April compared with March as lower prices boosted sales. The selloff is gathering pace across Europe, with the main indices all losing ground this morning: Tom Floyd, Senior Sales Trader at Foenix Partner, says investors are taking last night\u2019s Fed minute seriously: With multiple Fed speakers in recent days failing to convince markets of the possibility of June hikes, yesterday\u2019s Minutes seem to have finally done the trick. The Minutes showed Fed members would deem a June hike as \u201cappropriate\u201d so long as economic data continued to improve. With inflation data trending towards target and improving labour market conditions, the Fed\u2019s remaining issue was convincing markets a rise was a likely scenario. The first Harry Potter readers have long since left the classroom for the world of adult mugglehood. But Hogwart\u2019s finest continues to work his charms for UK publishers, Bloomsbury. They have reported a 5% jump in revenues for the last year, thanks to a 133% surge in sales of Harry Potter books. That includes a new illustrated version of \u201cHarry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone\u201d, which apparently went down terribly well. Bloomsbury say: Reviews were consistently good with the Telegraph saying the book was: \u201ca triumph - a book so alive it seems to jump, explode and slither out of your hands as you read.\u201d We sold rights in Jim Kay\u2019s illustrations in 28 languages. Our re-jacketed Jonny Duddle editions of the seven Harry Potter novels continued to perform strongly in all territories. An illustrated version of the Chamber of Secrets is coming soon, along with new content from J. K. Rowling for the new edition of Fantastic Beasts &amp; Where to Find Them. It\u2019s a case of \u201cRevenues leviosa!\u201d, say those wizards at fastFT.... Peter Fankhauser, chief executive of Thomas Cook, is also calling for a shake-up in the school holiday system to help parents get cheaper holidays. He tells reporters that: \u201cUK authorities should look across the pond to Germany and Switzerland where they agree a staggered start of school holiday dates. That relieves some of the pressure. If you had an agreement from local authorities in the UK to spread the dates... that would help us as well, it would help everybody.\u201d Fankhauser said Thomas Cook was doing \u201ceverything we can\u201d to make holidays more affordable for families who face huge hikes in prices during the school holidays. To get the best deal: \u201cyou have to start early in the cycle\u201d, he said. Last week, a UK parent won a landmark case in the High Court against his local authority, after he took his daughter away on holiday during term time. The ruling appeared to give the green light for parents to take their children out of state schools without permission so long as they have a good record of attendance. The government, though, quickly vowed to close this new loophole.... Shares in Thomas Cook have fallen by 15% to a three-year low, after it reported a 5% drop in summer bookings. The holiday company warned this morning that underlying profits will hit the bottom of analyst expectations. It reported that tourists are shunning Turkey, where a suicide bomber killed 10 Germans in an Istanbul square in January. Turkey had been Thomas Cook\u2019s second most popular destination last year; in 2016, though, more tourists are choosing the Balearics (up 14%), Canaries (up 23%) and and USA (up 29%). Thomas Cook says: Demand for Turkey - our second largest market last year - remains significantly below last year\u2019s levels. This has impacted our German Airlines business in particular. Demand for holidays to Belgium is also down, following the Brussels terrorist attacks in March. And that sent shares down to 75p, the lowest since March 2013. The London stock market has shed 50 points, or 0.8%, at the start of trading. Mining shares are leading the selloff, with silver miner Fresnillo sliding by 5%. That\u2019s because the prospect of higher US interest rates is pushing up the US dollar, and driving down commodity prices. Other European markets are also dropping, with the German DAX shedding 1% and the French CAC down 0.5%. Most Asian stock markets are in the red today after the Federal Reserve put a June interest rate rise on the table. The Singapore and Hong Kong indices are leading the selloff Investors are baulked at the prospect of tightening of monetary policy, as Andrew Sullivan, sales trader at Haitong Securities explains (via Associated Press) \u201cMarkets have looked for government stimulus as a reason for investing rather than good company economics or fundamentals. Obviously therefore if there\u2019s less chance of stimulus people are left wondering what to do. \u201cYes it will be a shock to people, and I\u2019m sure there will be a knee jerk reaction but the reality is we are nowhere near normal rates.\u201d Only Japan has avoided any damage -- because Tokyo traders are pleased to see the yen weakening against the US dollar. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. Coming up today... We\u2019ll be tracking the reaction to last night\u2019s Federal Reserve minutes, which showed that America\u2019s central bank could be ready to raise interest rates next month. The Fed surprised investors by revealing that many policymakers believe a June rate hike is appropriate, if economic data over the next few weeks justifies it. As we covered in last night\u2019s liveblog, the minutes of April\u2019s meeting showed that: \u201cMost participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen and inflation making progress toward the [Fed\u2019s] 2% objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the [Fed] to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June.\u201d And that has sent investors scrambling to adjust their expectations - as many had only expected one rate rise in 2016, or even none at all. The minutes also sent the dollar spiking last night, and is likely to weigh on European markets today. Also coming up today \u2026 9.30am: UK retail sales figures for April. Economists are expecting a rise of 0.7%, following a shock 1.6% tumble in March 12.30pm: The European Central Bank releases the minutes of its last meeting. Analysts will look for details of its new stimulus programme, and signs of dissent among the governing council. 1.30pm: The latest weekly US jobless report, showing how many people filed new unemployment claims last week Top Federal Reserve policymakers Stanley Fischer and William Dudley are speaking later today. 6pm: Gertjan Vlieghe, member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, is delivering a speech in London There\u2019s quite a flurry of financial results this morning, including: Thomas Cook, Mothercare, Bloomsbury Publishing, Royal Mail, drinks firm Britvic, construction firm Balfour Beatty, financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown and asset manager 3i. We\u2019ll pick the most interesting bits out... There could be fireworks in Germany today, where Deutsche Bank is holding its AGM: And leading finance minister are heading to Japan, for a G7 meeting, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any action today.",

Following Wednesday\u2019s more hawkish than expected Fed minutes, a number of the central bank\u2019s key figures have lined up to suggest the June meeting is \u201clive\u201d in terms of a possible rate hike.</p> <p>Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anxiety is setting in for financial markets, as the proposition of another rate hike from the Fed draws the bears out once more. Today\u2019s US open has seen the Dow crash to a two month low, bringing the FTSE down with it as rate sensitive banks benefit at the expense of the wider market. The US dollar strength continues to be a running theme, as energy, metal and materials producers suffer at the hands of a yet another sea of red for the sector.</p> <p>Yesterday\u2019s Fed minutes provided the latest clue that perhaps a June rate hike may not be such a crazy idea, with the markets now factoring in a 32% chance of action. This shift from 4% on Monday to 32% today goes a long way to explain the substantial rise in the US dollar this week. With a hawkish Fed and a three year high in US CPI, the potential implications of a strong jobs report in June is starting to click in the minds of investors.</p> </blockquote> <p>With the dollar rising on the interest rate outlook, commodity prices fell back, including copper hitting a three month low and Brent crude losing 1% to $48.33. So mining companies were among the leading fallers, as were travel companies in the wake of a disappointing update from Thomas Cook and the disappearance of a flight from Paris to Cairo. But banks benefited from hopes that any US rate rise would support their balance sheets. The final scores showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 fell 112.45 points or 1.82% to 6053.35, its biggest one day percentage fall since early February</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.48% to 9795.89</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.85% at 4282.54</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.95% to 17,545.56</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.14% lower at 8674.7</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market fell 0.96% to 622.28</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 140 points or 0.8%.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook shares lost nearly a fifth of their value after the holiday company warned that bookings had fallen following terrorist attacks in Tunisia and Brussels. Bookings for summer 2016 were 5% down on last year, the company said, as demand for holidays to Turkey, Tunisia and Egypt fell sharply. Full-year earnings are now expected to come in at the bottom end of City expectations. The warning sent the company\u2019s shares tumbling 19% to a three-year low of 72.45p, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 250. The downgrade also coincided with news of the disappearance of an EgyptAir flight on its way from Paris to Cairo, which affected the whole sector amid renewed concerns that consumers would be reluctant to travel. The rival company Tui, owner of the Thomson brand, fell 25p to \u00a310.08, while airlines were also under pressure, with the owner of British Airways, International Airlines Group, down 12p at 515p and easyJet 26p lower at \u00a314.61. Germany\u2019s Lufthansa lost 1.2% and Air France fell 1%. Elsewhere cruise company Carnival dropped 64p to \u00a334.85, and InterContinental Hotels lost 88p to \u00a325.25. Thomas Cook\u2019s previous update in March had also been cautious, saying the outlook was dependent on a sustained recovery in consumer confidence, and came on the same day that terrorists attacked Brussels airport. In the company\u2019s latest comments, Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, said demand for other destinations such as Spain and the Canary Islands had risen, but it had not fully compensated for the fall in bookings to Turkey. \u201cAs we look ahead to our busiest period, Thomas Cook is trading well to destinations other than Turkey, with particularly strong bookings to Spain and the USA. However demand for Turkey \u2013 our second largest market last year \u2013 remains significantly below last year\u2019s levels.\u201d Commenting on the inflated prices charged by travel companies during the school holidays, Fankhauser said the UK should learn from Germany and Switzerland. \u201cUK authorities should look across the pond to Germany and Switzerland where they agree a staggered start of school holiday dates,\u201d he said. \u201cThat relieves some of the pressure. If you had an agreement from local authorities in the UK to spread the dates \u2026 that would help us as well; it would help everybody.\u201d He said Thomas Cook was doing everything it could to offer affordable holidays for families, adding that to get the best deals, \u201cyou have to book early in the cycle\u201d. His comments came after the high court last week ruled in favour of a father who refused to pay a fine for taking his daughter on holiday during the school term. Fankhauser said the attacks in Brussels airport and on the city\u2019s metro system in March had brought its Belgian business \u201calmost to a standstill\u201d. Following UK Foreign Office guidance, Thomas Cook stopped flying to Tunisia after the attack in the resort of Sousse in June 2015. It has also stopped flying to Sharm el-Sheikh, which was the most popular Egyptian resort with Britons but is now on the Foreign Office\u2019s list of places to avoid. Excluding Turkey, summer bookings for 2016 were up 6% compared with the same point last year. Group revenue edged higher in the first half of the financial year to 31 March, rising to \u00a32.67bn from \u00a32.66bn a year earlier. Thomas Cook said it expected full-year underlying earnings to be between \u00a3310m and \u00a3335m, at the lower end of analysts\u2019 expectations. Analysts at Numis said: \u201cWe remain unenthusiastic about the investment merits of Thomas Cook Group. We believe that the basic business model continues to face structural challenges.\u201d Credit Suisse cut its forecasts, saying: \u201cSlow booking trends impacted by geopolitical events in both source markets and destinations drives our 2016 earnings per share estimates down 21%.\u201d",

Government plans for the tax were confirmed in the Queen\u2019s speech on Wednesday. The Britvic chief executive, Simon Litherland, said the company was aiming to cut the calories in its products by 20% within four years. There had been concerns that it would be affected by shoppers making healthier choices, but Britvic said pre-tax profit rose by 7.3% to \u00a354.5m in the year to 10 April.

Two-thirds of the drinks that Britvic sells, which include Robinsons squash, Fruit Shoot, Pepsi and J2O, currently fall below the proposed threshold for the tax, which was announced in March by George Osborne, the chancellor. However, Litherland admitted that cutting sugar did not always boost sales: the company lost sales after ditching the added-sugar version of Robinsons because shoppers switched to other brands. The sugar tax is not the only problem facing Britvic. UK sales were also hit by supermarket price wars. The price of squash in the UK declined by 3.9% over the six months, more than twice the rate of the same period a year earlier. Litherland said: \u201cI don\u2019t anticipated things getting any better in the short term.\u201d Falling prices were partly being fuelled by a drop in input costs, but they were likely to rise again next year, he added.",

      "bodyText": "The German drugs and chemicals group Bayer has pounced on Monsanto, the world\u2019s biggest seed company, with an unsolicited takeover offer likely to be worth more than $40bn (\u00a327bn). Bayer, which invented aspirin in the 19th century, said executives from both companies had met to \u201cprivately discuss a negotiated acquisition of Monsanto Company\u201d to create a \u201cleading integrated agriculture business\u201d. Combining their operations would create a giant business making drugs such as Yasmin birth control pills, pesticides and seeds for genetically modified crops. Monsanto confirmed an unsolicited takeover proposal from Bayer and said the company\u2019s board was reviewing the offer with its financial and legal advisers. Monsanto, based in St Louis, Missouri, has a market value of $42bn. Last year, the company failed in an attempt to buy Swiss pesticides company Syngenta for $47bn; it has since itself become a takeover target, with global crop prices falling. German chemicals company BASF is also known to be interested. Prof John Colley of Warwick Business School said: \u201cMonsanto certainly do not want to be bought by a European business. However, shareholders always have their price. No doubt Monsanto will reject the bid, but it will need to convince its shareholders that it has seriously considered the offer. A higher bid is likely. \u201cDemand is poor for agribusiness products currently due to low commodity prices. Overcapacity has led to poor performance and lower share prices, in turn providing opportunities for mergers.\u201d Syngenta agreed to be bought by the state-backed China National Chemical Corporation in February. The $43bn deal, the largest foreign acquisition by a Chinese company, is being scrutinised by US regulators amid concerns about the security of the US food supply. A deal between Bayer and Monsanto could also raise antitrust fears in the US, because there is overlap between their seeds businesses, particularly soybeans, cotton and canola. Monsanto is thought to have approached Bayer earlier this year about buying or forming a joint venture for its crop science division. Phillip Tunney, the head of the UK chemical sector group at law firm Eversheds, said: \u201cThis is just the latest development in a series of consolidations in the agrichemicals sector, which has seen some pretty eyewatering numbers involved. It will be interesting to see how any combined company would deal with antitrust issues, which are likely to be significant, and whether Bayer would undertake any divestments to help fund the acquisition.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Asda sales fall for seventh quarter in a row", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Asda has reported another quarter of poor trading as like-for-like sales slumped 5.7% in the first three months of 2016. The supermarket chain\u2019s American parent company, Walmart, admitted that price cuts had failed to stop customers defecting to rivals such as the discounters Aldi and Lidl. \u201cThe UK continues to struggle, due primarily to fierce competition,\u201d said Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer, Brett Biggs. \u201cImprovements in price and product availability throughout the quarter were not enough to overcome traffic and food volume declines in our large format stores.\u201d Asda\u2019s performance was a slight improvement on the 5.8% decline in underlying sales suffered in the final quarter of 2015, which was its worst-ever quarterly sales fall. Asda has now reported seven consecutive quarters of declining sales. Asda is battling the rise of the discounters and stronger performances from its major rivals Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons. While profits at all four supermarket chains have come under pressure, Asda had opted to defend its bottom line rather than its market share. But with the retailer\u2019s market share down from 17.3% two years ago to 16% today, according to Kantar Worldpanel, Asda chief executive Andy Clarke has been forced into action. In a presentation to investors, Biggs revealed that the number of shoppers visiting Asda had declined 5% during the 13 weeks to 30 March. The average amount shoppers spent \u2013 another measure of performance \u2013 was also down 0.7%. The combination meant that it was a less profitable quarter than the same period a year ago. \u201cAsda has lost its low-price crown to players like Aldi and Lidl and, despite its best efforts to regain ground, has found one of its key points of differentiation undermined,\u201d said Conlumino analyst Neil Saunders. \u201cIt has been hard for Asda to mitigate and offset its losses to the discounters with gains from other players.\u201d To win back shoppers Clarke has embarked on \u201cproject renewal\u201d \u2013 an overhaul of the business designed to \u201csimplify and strengthen the customer offer, reduce costs and drive sales\u201d. This year 750 jobs have gone in its stores and head office as it looks to streamline operations. The under-pressure Clarke, who broke with the usual tradition of holding a press briefing to discuss performance, is focusing the retailer\u2019s financial power on making its big stores more appealing to shoppers. To that end it has put the brakes on new business channels such as opening click and collect points in petrol and railway stations and targeting small store openings in London. Instead Asda will refurbish 95 of its biggest stores, some of whose floor space is being handed over to retailers such as the French sportswear company Decathlon, this year. Changes are also taking place behind the scenes with the closure of staff canteens and the removal of services such as photo-processing and pizza-making to cut costs. Savings that had already been made were being invested back in the business, said Biggs. The supermarket is pulling up to a fifth of its products from the shelves as part of a review of its 40,000 lines. Tesco carried out a similar exercise last year in the face of customer defections to the low-cost, low-choice Aldi and Lidl, which typically stock fewer than 2,000 products. Clarke has also promised a fresh wave of price cuts as it tries to narrow the gap with the German discounters. \u201cIf Asda was a ship it is one that is limping back to port having been torpedoed by smaller and more agile competition,\u201d said Phil Dorrell, a consultant at Retail Remedy. \u201cTrying to maintain its position on price alone is simply not working, which it should have realised several quarters ago.\u201d The sales torpor at Asda has led to questions about Clarke\u2019s future. After six years in the job he is the longest serving chief executive of the big four grocers, with last year\u2019s hiring of Sainsbury\u2019s retail and operations director, Roger Burnley, who arrives in the autumn, pointing to a changing of the guard.",

Asda has now reported seven consecutive quarters of declining sales.</p> <p>Asda is battling the rise of the discounters and stronger performances from its major rivals Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons. While profits at all four supermarket chains have come under pressure, Asda had opted to defend its bottom line rather than its market share. </p> <p>But with the retailer\u2019s market share down from 17.3% two years ago to 16% today, according to Kantar Worldpanel, Asda chief executive Andy Clarke has been forced into action.</p> <p>In a presentation to investors, Biggs revealed that the number of shoppers visiting Asda had declined 5% during the 13 weeks to 30 March. The average amount shoppers spent \u2013 another measure of performance \u2013 was also down 0.7%. The combination meant that it was a less profitable quarter than the same period a year ago.</p> <p>\u201cAsda has lost its low-price crown to players like Aldi and Lidl and, despite its best efforts to regain ground, has found one of its key points of differentiation undermined,\u201d said Conlumino analyst Neil Saunders. \u201cIt has been hard for Asda to mitigate and offset its losses to the discounters with gains from other players.\u201d</p> <p>To win back shoppers Clarke has embarked on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/14/asda-supermarket-sales-slump-james-martin-ads\">\u201cproject renewal\u201d</a> \u2013 an overhaul of the business designed to \u201csimplify and strengthen the customer offer, reduce costs and drive sales\u201d. This year 750 jobs have gone in its stores and head office as it looks to streamline operations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2f7cdc1ac2965b6d47404f93f16b87bf5fb1fab5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f7cdc1ac2965b6d47404f93f16b87bf5fb1fab5/1677_282_2577_3221/800.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Clarke.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Clarke.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The under-pressure Clarke, who broke with the usual tradition of holding a press briefing to discuss performance, is focusing the retailer\u2019s financial power on making its big stores more appealing to shoppers. To that end it has put the brakes on new business channels such as opening click and collect points in petrol and railway stations and targeting small store openings in London.</p> <p>Instead Asda will refurbish 95 of its biggest stores, some of whose floor space is being handed over to retailers such as the French sportswear company Decathlon, this year. Changes are also taking place behind the scenes with the closure of staff canteens and the removal of services such as photo-processing and pizza-making to cut costs. Savings that had already been made were being invested back in the business, said Biggs.</p> <p>The supermarket is pulling up to a fifth of its products from the shelves as part of a review of its 40,000 lines. Tesco carried out a similar exercise last year in the face of customer defections to the low-cost, low-choice Aldi and Lidl, which typically stock fewer than 2,000 products. Clarke has also promised a fresh wave of price cuts as it tries to narrow the gap with the German discounters. </p> <p>\u201cIf Asda was a ship it is one that is limping back to port having been torpedoed by smaller and more agile competition,\u201d said Phil Dorrell, a consultant at Retail Remedy. \u201cTrying to maintain its position on price alone is simply not working, which it should have realised several quarters ago.\u201d</p> <p>The sales torpor at Asda has led to questions about Clarke\u2019s future. After six years in the job he is the longest serving chief executive of the big four grocers, with last year\u2019s hiring of Sainsbury\u2019s retail and operations director, Roger Burnley, who arrives in the autumn, pointing to a changing of the guard.</p> <p> <em> <br></em></p>",

Maybe it was the onset of spring and better weather that convinced shoppers to venture out. Could it be that their outside room, sorry, their garden, needed a bit of freshening up? Figures from the rest of the high street and online stores told a similar story: we still have an appetite for more things and we are far from reaching peak stuff. The problem is that shoppers are not spending more than a year ago. They are using their gains from falling food and clothing prices to buy more furniture, and bits and bobs for the home. On average, store prices fell. This means that the economy as a whole is gaining little extra from shopaholic Britons, while other sectors are slackening quite markedly. David Kern, the chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), put it succinctly in his response to the figures for March. \u201cThe fact that average store prices fell suggests that inflationary pressures in the economy are weak,\u201d he said. It is a sign of weak demand if there are no inflationary pressures, Kern said, which \u201cstrengthens the argument for the MPC [monetary policy committee] to persevere with low interest rates for the time being to support the recovery.\u201d Kern is nothing if not consistent. He has long argued that the bedrock of the economy, manufacturing, is weaker than many suspect and more open to the global slowdown in trade than the high street. Last week, the chancellor, George Osborne, told Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, that \u201cthe whole government\u201d was throwing itself into supporting manufacturing. He did not mention shopping as a route out of the current slowdown. Osborne agrees with Kern that low interest rates are an essential element of the support for making things and exporting them. But Kern and the BCC want much more from the chancellor. Perhaps after the referendum, Osborne will dust off his \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d speech and revisit proposals for a more activist policy towards manufacturing. In the meantime, Kern says the vibrancy of the UK high street contrasts with the manufacturing sector and \u201chighlights the unbalanced nature of Britain\u2019s recovery\u201d. \u201cTo secure sustained growth, we need a more balanced economic structure with a stronger focus on exports, investment and manufacturing,\u201d he said.

Sales of the enduringly popular books by JK Rowling jumped by 133% in the 12 months to 29 February, boosted by the new edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, illustrated by Jim Kay and released in October. 1.1m copies have been sold. It will be followed by an illustrated edition of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, to be published within the next year. The first Harry Potter book was published in 1997, and the series is now available in 78 languages with more than 450m copies sold globally. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the final instalment, became the fastest selling book ever when it was published in 2007, selling 2.65m copies in the first 24 hours in the UK. The hugely popular Harry Potter films further expanded the franchise\u2019s reach, with the eight movies released between 2001 and 2011 generating more than $7.7bn in global box office receipts. The spin-off film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which marks Rowling\u2019s screenwriting debut and is intended as the first instalment of a trilogy, is due for release in November 2016. Lisa Campbell, news editor at the Bookseller magazine, said Rowling\u2019s creation remained popular with fans smitten the first time around, while also piquing the interest of a new generation. \u201cThis is down to several factors \u2013 the publisher\u2019s skill and ability to continue to stimulate readers\u2019 interests by releasing new editions, such as the recent \u00a3150 deluxe edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone and the illustrated versions by Jim Kay, but also the success of national events such as Harry Potter Book Night, now celebrated across the world in libraries and bookshops.\u201d Strong demand for the titles helped push pre-tax profit up by 8% over the year to \u00a313m at Bloomsbury.

Moody\u2019s said a fall in house prices triggered by a Brexit would make it more affordable for people trying to get on the property ladder for the first time. \u201cFirst-time buyers would benefit from lower competition for housing, as house price and rental inflation would slow down if immigration is curbed,\u201d said Gaby Trinkaus, a vice president and senior analyst at Moody\u2019s. Trinkaus added that whatever the outcome of next month\u2019s referendum, the outlook was picking up for first-time buyers in the capital. \u201cRegardless of the referendum vote, the ambitious affordable housing agenda for London following the mayoral election will help those looking to get on the housing ladder,\u201d she said. Last week, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said a vote to leave the EU at next month\u2019s referendum could cause a house price and stock market crash. \u201cWe have looked at all the scenarios. We have done our homework and we haven\u2019t found anything positive to say about a Brexit vote,\u201d she said. Estate agents also claimed thousands of pounds could be wiped off the value of UK houses if Britain votes to leave the EU. Prices in London could fall by as much as \u00a37,500, while homeowners in the rest of the country could lose \u00a32,300, the National Association of Estate Agents said. However, Moody\u2019s suggested Brexit would be positive for cash-strapped first-time buyers who are currently priced out of the market. UK prices rose in March at their fastest monthly rate since 2004, the latest official figures showed, boosted over the month as buy-to-let investors rushed to complete purchases ahead of a stamp duty rise in April. House prices increased 2.5% over the month, taking the average price of a home to \u00a3291,820 according to the Office for National Statistics. Moody\u2019s said London\u2019s property market could be more affected by Brexit, and that landlords could struggle to pay mortgages because of falling rental demand. Trinkaus said: \u201cA decline in rental demand could hit landlords\u2019 ability to pay their mortgages on buy-to-let properties if London becomes less attractive to foreign nationals.\u201d Moody\u2019s also warned that self-employed people in Britain would be more at risk than employees from fluctuating pay in the event of Brexit, potentially affecting their ability to make mortgage repayments. The agency said that should a vote to leave the EU have a bigger negative impact on the UK economy than it is expecting, mortgage arrears would increase among self employed borrowers. \u201cThe highest risk would apply to those borrowers with additional risk characteristics such as poor payment history, high loan-to-value or interest-only features,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. It added that London had the highest concentration of self-employed people in the UK, at 17.3% in 2014. The number of self-employed swelled in Britain during the financial crisis, as many people who could not find permanent work or sufficient hours opted to work for themselves instead. Self-employment reached the highest level since records began 40 years ago, with the proportion of the total workforce self-employed rising to 15% in 2014 \u2013 or 4.6m people - compared with 13% in 2008, and 8.7% in 1975.",

      "bodyText": "Retail sales rebounded last month as cheap deals lured British spenders back to the shops, but clothing sales suffered from chilly weather. There was little sign that uncertainty around June\u2019s EU referendum was hurting consumers\u2019 willingness to spend in April. Official figures showed retail sales volumes jumped 1.3% on the month, well ahead of expectations for a 0.5% rise in a Reuters poll. Sales were up 4.3% on a year earlier. The Office for National Statistics also revised its March figures to show a much smaller 0.5% drop in sales on the month, rather than the 1.3% it had previously reported. Retail figures can be volatile from month to month but will help allay fears that British consumers, the main drivers of the economic recovery, have run out of steam. Some surveys have pointed to lower consumer confidence against the backdrop of a global slowdown and in anticipation of next month\u2019s EU referendum. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank in London, said the panic in the high street was over. \u201cThis marks a great start to the second quarter and could help to avert too much of a slowdown in GDP growth for the second quarter,\u201d he said. There was still a danger that consumers could hold back on more expensive, big ticket items before the 23 June referendum, but for now the vote did not seem to be affecting households, Clarke added, citing figures on Wednesday showing employment had hit a new record high. \u201cAs with yesterday\u2019s labour market data, this release suggests: Brexit vote jitters \u2013 what Brexit vote jitters?\u201d There were signs that low inflation, which fell back to 0.3% last month, was buoying consumers, said Sam Alderson, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. \u201cWhile business confidence has notably waned in recent readings, consumer confidence appears to have remained robust, supported by rising spending power, improved credit availability and continued increases in house prices,\u201d he added. \u201cFortunately, these trends look set to continue for some time to come. Though gradually recovering from the near-zero levels seen through the course of 2015, we expect inflation to remain below 1% by the end of this year.\u201d The ONS said all store types, except textile, clothing and footwear stores, recorded increases in sales volumes on a year ago. Its head of retail sales, Melanie Richard, commented: \u201cClothing stores remain the main drag on growth in the retail sector, with sales hampered by unseasonal weather. However, both the volume and value of sales increased in April compared with March as lower prices boosted sales.\u201d Clothes retailers told the ONS that the early Easter hurt their summer ranges. Ian Geddes, head of retail at consultancy Deloitte, agreed. \u201cThe long Easter break falling in March has meant that retailers have not benefited from having a key shopping weekend in April. This has led to particularly poor sales in the clothing and fashion sector, exacerbated by another month of poor, unseasonably cold weather.\u201d But experts also say longer-term trends for consumers to spend more on going out and travel and less on goods are also hurting the high street, which last month suffered BHS\u2019s fall into administration. Geddes added: \u201cIt is clear from our research that consumers are increasingly choosing to spend their money on leisure activities, rather than spending on retail. Lower inflation has boosted consumers\u2019 purchasing power, enabling them to spend more on discretionary items, such as holidays. Low prices on everyday purchases has limited the rise in spending on essentials, which is being felt by retailers, particularly grocers.\u201d There is also pressure on bricks-and-mortar stores from internet retailers, which continued to grow their share of the market last month. The ONS said online sales increased in value by 1.7% on the month in April and by 9.3% on a year earlier. The amount spent online accounted for 13.4% of all retail spending, excluding automotive fuel, up from 12.4% in April 2015.",

We are co-operating with the authorities.</p> <p>\u201cWe do not comment on the subject of ongoing investigations nor on the countries in which those investigations are being conducted.

      "bodyText": "The Turnbull government\u2019s failure to chart a credible path to surplus has made it even more difficult to achieve the goal over the medium term, experts have warned. A panel of former high-ranking federal finance officials, as well as former leader of the Liberal party, John Hewson, has warned that the country\u2019s fiscal settings have become further compromised by the 2016 budget, even though policy should be playing an increasingly vital role in a low-growth, low-interest-rate world. Speaking at the Australian National University forum on the 2016 budget in Canberra on Thursday, the panel said it was not clear from the 3 May budget how the government could return the budget to a sustainable footing. Jan Harris, a former deputy secretary to the treasury, said commentary about the budget has been eerily similar to 2009-10, when the then Labor government delivered the biggest deficit in Australia\u2019s history. She said familiar complaints about the latest budget included: the long-promised return to surplus receding another year across the horizon; spending cuts from the past three years being used primarily to pay for new spending; most of the budget repair was coming from revenues increasing as a share of GDP. \u201cFor all the rhetoric and efforts to date since the GFC, governments have definitely struggled to shift the dial on returning the budget to surplus,\u201d she said. Hewson said the government seemed to have given up on having a \u201csensible, significant reform package\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019ve just had a number of objectives where they\u2019ve had to tick the box, in my view, politically,\u201d he said. \u201cOne is, they had to be seen to be doing something about budget repair. Secondly they wanted to neuter, or steal, some of the policy positions that the ALP had put on the table. \u201cAnd thirdly they wanted to be seen as fair ... [but] there\u2019s not too much done in genuine budget repair.\u201d The forum was held just hours after the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, dismissed claims by the Grattan Institute that his plan to cut the company tax rate by 5% would deliver just half the benefit he has been claiming since budget night. The institute\u2019s director, John Daley, said on Thursday that the government was focusing on its tax cut delivering GDP growth of 1.2% over the long term, but the real benefits would be half that, with gross national income growth of just 0.6%. The former head of the finance department, Michael Keating, told the panel that the budget was good because it did pass \u201cthe fairness test\u201d. He said the superannuation reforms \u201cimminently meet the fairness test\u201d, as did the crackdown on tax avoidance by foreign companies. But the budget would have been fairer if the government had not allowed the deficit repair levy to expire next year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Worsening economic conditions in Asia, Latin America and the Arab world threaten to undo decades of progress in reducing global poverty, according to a report by the International Labour Organization. The UN agency said a third of workers earn less than the \u201cmoderate poverty threshold\u201d of $3.10 (\u00a32.10) a day and their prospects are deteriorating as global trade slows and low oil prices affect producers in developing countries. It urged richer countries to focus on improving the quality of jobs in poorer nations, rather than just on aid, in order to create more sustainable and better paid employment. Research for the ILO\u2019s world employment social utlook (Weso) report for 2016 found that almost 2.5 billion people remain in poverty across the world, despite huge efforts to increase the number of jobs and raise the incomes of low-paid workers. The agency said eliminating poverty by raising incomes to a minimum $3.10 a day would cost $600bn a year, which would only be possible through a mix of higher-grade jobs and transfers from the better off through taxes to pay for healthcare, education and welfare benefits. It argued that without investment in more skilled jobs and better social protection, the bottom 30% of earners would continue to work precarious jobs without basic social protections such as healthcare and welfare benefits, and claim less than 2% of the world\u2019s income. In its first social outlook report (pdf) last year, the ILO, which monitors global employment trends, said only a quarter of workers had found stable employment, with the rest on temporary or short-term contracts, in informal jobs \u2013 often without any contract \u2013 or in unpaid family jobs. The 2016 report, which is mostly based on figures up to 2012, said: \u201cA significant proportion of those who moved out of poverty continue to live on just a few dollars per day, often with limited access to essential services and social protection, which would allow them to exit precarious living conditions on a more permanent basis. Also, in those developed countries where quality jobs are scarce, there is growing anxiety among middle-class families about their ability to sustain their income position. \u201cSimilarly, the recent deterioration of economic prospects in Asia, Latin America, the Arab region, and those countries rich in natural resources, has begun to expose the fragility of the recent employment and social advances. \u201cAlready, in a number of these countries, income inequality has begun to rise after being in decline for decades, and thus a reversal of some of the progress made to date in tackling poverty is not inconceivable. Likewise, latest trends suggest a further escalation in relative poverty levels in Europe and other developed countries.\u201d The UN has recently established a goal of ending poverty by 2030, but has struggled to persuade the US and other developed economies to commit funds to invest in countries that rely on labour-intensive agriculture for most incomes. In a report last year, the UN warned that slowing economic growth since 2008 was reversing decades of improving employment levels, with young people having borne the brunt of the financial crisis. In 2015, the number of unemployed people was 28 million higher than it had been in 2007, and an estimated 39 million people had dropped out of the labour market. The ILO director general, Guy Ryder, said: \u201cClearly, the sustainable development goal of ending poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030 is at risk. If we are serious about the 2030 agenda and want to finally put an end to the scourge of poverty perpetuating across generations, then we must focus on the quality of jobs in all nations.\u201d Raymond Torres, the ILO special adviser on social and economic issues, said: \u201cOnly through deliberately improving the quality of employment for those who have jobs and creating new, decent work, will we provide a durable exit from precarious living conditions and improve livelihoods for the working poor and their families.\u201d Increases in relative poverty across Europe had restricted the ability of less well off workers to better themselves and their families, threatening social cohesion, the ILO said. Weso 2016 found that the incidence of relative poverty had increased by one percentage point in the EU since the financial crisis, while remaining flat in the US. The report estimates that in 2012, more than 300 million people in developed countries were living in poverty, where their earnings represented less than 60% of median incomes.",

Also, in those developed countries where quality jobs are scarce, there is growing anxiety among middle-class families about their ability to sustain their income position.<br></p> <p>\u201cSimilarly, the recent deterioration of economic prospects in Asia, Latin America, the Arab region, and those countries rich in natural resources, has begun to expose the fragility of the recent employment and social advances. </p> <p>\u201cAlready, in a number of these countries, income inequality has begun to rise after being in decline for decades, and thus a reversal of some of the progress made to date in tackling poverty is not inconceivable.

In 2015, the number of unemployed people was 28 million higher than it had been in 2007, and an estimated 39 million people had dropped out of the labour market.</p> <p>The ILO director general, Guy Ryder, said: \u201cClearly, the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/poverty/\">sustainable development goal</a> of ending poverty in all its forms everywhere by 2030 is at risk. If we are serious about the 2030 agenda and want to finally put an end to the scourge of poverty perpetuating across generations, then we must focus on the quality of jobs in all nations.\u201d </p> <p>Raymond Torres, the ILO special adviser on social and economic issues, said: \u201cOnly through deliberately improving the quality of employment for those who have jobs and creating new, decent work, will we provide a durable exit from precarious living conditions and improve livelihoods for the working poor and their families.\u201d <br></p> <p>Increases in relative poverty across Europe had restricted the ability of less well off workers to better themselves and their families, threatening social cohesion, the ILO said.<br></p> <p>Weso 2016 found that the incidence of relative poverty had increased by one percentage point in the EU since the financial crisis, while remaining flat in the US. The report estimates that in 2012, more than 300 million people in developed countries were living in poverty, where their earnings represented less than 60% of median incomes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The latest wages growth figures released on Wednesday saw a record low annual growth of just 2%. It marks three years of negligible growth in real wages, and renders the need for a tax cut for those earning over $80,000 to protect against bracket creep an idea rather out of step with reality. Oh for the days of the wages breakout. Coming off the back of the RBA downgrading its outlook for inflation, Wednesday\u2019s wages price index figures reinforce \u2013 should any reinforcement be needed \u2013 that there is bugger all demand in the economy. Wages in the private sector in March grew just 0.4% in trend terms, tying the lowest quarterly growth on record with that achieved during the depths of the GFC in 2009: But on the annual growth side of things we are way past tying records. Private sector wage growth in the year to March rose just 1.9% in trend terms \u2013 the first time it has ever been below 2%. To give you some perspective, during the GFC, annual wages were still rising by 2.6%, and that was considered astonishingly low \u2013 now it\u2019s a rate not seen for nearly three years: The reason is two-fold: firstly there is very little inflation growth, and as a result the pressure on wages to rise is lessened; and secondly we have a very flexible IR system. Back when the Fair Work Act was introduced the line-up of those on the conservative side of politics and the media warning of a wages breakout was long and dull. In late November 2010 the Australian\u2019s editorial warned Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan directly that there needed to be more flexibility in the IR system lest they risk \u201cthe kind of malaise that produced soaring inflation and exorbitant interest rates decades ago.\u201d At that point annual wages growth was 3.9%; it has never been as high since. But while a flexible system does have benefits \u2013 certainly the RBA believes it has helped keep unemployment lower than otherwise would be expected given the weak GDP growth \u2013 at the moment the flexibility would appear to be all on the employer\u2019s side given the actual growth of employment and hours worked. Normally wages growth increases when the annual growth of hours worked improves \u2013 especially if that growth is over 2%. And yet while the hours worked in the second half of last year was growing strongly, wages growth fell. And as the level of growth in hours worked has now dropped off it means we\u2019re unlikely to see any increase in wages growth in the near term: It also means the budget figures for 2015-16 are likely to be a smidge wrong. The budget projected annual wages growth in June this year of 2.25%. To reach that level wages in the June quarter would need to rise by 0.8% \u2013 a level not achieved since September 2012. And if the budget figures are overshooting the wages growth just a month after the date the budget was handed down, it does not bode well for their prediction for wages growth by June 2019 to be at 3.25%. The one small blessing is that even with the record low wages growth, our current record level of underlying inflation is even lower. The last annual growth of underlying inflation \u2013 which gets rid of some of the irregular bumps and dips was just 1.7%. This meant that in the past year there was a slight uptick in real wages growth: But I doubt anyone is going to break out the champagne over a 0.3% real wages growth \u2013 especially given how low it is compared to previous levels. It means that over the past decade real wages have increased just a touch over 5%, and the current period of flat real wages growth is now as long as that experienced during the GFC: This means that our purchasing power (that is, the quantity of things you can buy with your income) has likely fallen. Real wage growth doesn\u2019t take into account increases in your average tax rate that come with pay increases (even if you stay in the same tax bracket) or reductions in government payments that occur due to going over certain thresholds. It means that for your purchasing power to actually remain steady, you need your wage to increase by slightly more than inflation. And with real wages flat, that means there\u2019s a good chance employees on average have less purchasing power than they did three years ago. The low wages are being felt across all industries. While the mining industry has seen the biggest fall from its 10 year average growth, no industry is currently experiencing stronger wages growth than its average: Similarly all states are experiencing lower wages growth than they have in the past decade \u2013 with the ACT home to the lowest wages growth in the country. Wages in the ACT have for nearly 2 years now being growing annually by less than 2%: With such low wages growth across the country I suspect the sales pitch for a tax cut for those earning more than $80,000 to protect against bracket creep may not be the biggest winner. At the current level of wage growth, someone earning $70,000 today wouldn\u2019t have to worry about reaching $80,000 until 2024. The bracket-creep tax cut is basically combating against a level of wage rises that aren\u2019t happening at the moment. The low wage growth would also mean any talk of penalty rates is rather more electorally potent. Maybe this is the new normal \u2013 perhaps wages and inflation growth will stay this low for the foreseeable future. But for now most Australians would barely notice any pay rises and certainly not to the extent that they would think giving up penalty rates will be balanced by more hours worked and solid growth in wages.",
