      "bodyText": "The scrap at Premier Foods, owner of Mr Kipling cakes, Angel Delight and Bisto gravy, is turning into a mini classic. On one side, there is an angry Hong Kong hedge fund, Oasis, that wants to oust Premier\u2019s chief executive; it calls Gavin Darby overpaid and accuses him of overseeing five years of failure at a \u201czombie-like\u201d company. On the other side, the board argues there are no quick fixes and has rolled out two retailing lords to heap praise on Darby. Lord MacLaurin, who established Tesco as a force in the land in the 1980s and 1990s, called his achievements \u201chugely impressive\u201d. Lord Price, who was in charge of Waitrose for a decade, said the activist risks \u201cdestroying significant value, rather than creating it\u201d if it succeeds. Who to believe? Well, one can understand why Oasis may receive a sympathetic hearing from other shareholders. A glance at the share price would cause most investors to splutter on their French Fancies. The company is worth slightly less today than the \u00a3353m it raised from investors in a rights issue in 2014. It is also carrying borrowings of \u00a3530m and has a deficit of \u00a3437m in one of its pension funds (the other fund, thankfully, is in significant surplus). The only brief excitement came in 2016 when US spice maker McCormick almost made a bid, but never quite did, having been given a brush-off by the board initially. But the growth and financial targets Premier set at the time have been missed. Thus Oasis is definitely correct about Darby\u2019s rewards \u2013 \u00a37m over five years is a lot for a company in Premier\u2019s position. Yet there is a hole in Oasis\u2019 proposal. Its alternative strategy for making progress in a horrible grocery market looks very much like wishful thinking. The idea is to sell an asset or two, with soup brand Batchelors the likely suspect, with the aim of reducing debt and throwing a few quid into the problematic pension fund. It\u2019s a nice thought if somebody wants to overpay for Batchelors. But flinging assets overboard at any price would be short-termist whereas the pension liabilities are for the long term. The last fire-sale saw Premier sell Quorn for \u00a3205m in 2011; the private equity buyer got \u00a3550m four years later. None of which is to suggest that Premier\u2019s board should get a free pass. The relationship with Nissin, the Japanese noodle firm that took a 19% stake at the time of the McCormick saga, looks too cosy for many tastes. Chairman Keith Hamill, in front of the City on Thursday, should be more open about whether the \u201ccooperation\u201d partnership limits Premier\u2019s strategic options. And he should show he is at least open-minded about tidying up loose pieces. Why for example, is the 49% stake in Hovis bread still hanging around? There is a fortnight to run before shareholders get to vote on Darby\u2019s survival. At the moment, you\u2019d probably prefer MacLaurin and Price\u2019s loyalism since they know the grocery territory. Oasis, if it wants to be taken seriously as a long-term-minded agitator (a very rare breed), needs to do more than shout \u201cenough is enough\u201d. It\u2019s nice to believe buyers would queue to buy Premier assets at juicy prices, but what if they don\u2019t? Relief for Bank as reality chimes with theory They will be breathing a sigh of relief at the Bank of England. The economic data is finally behaving as they said it would. After the weak first quarter, affected by the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d, the bounce-back is happening. This week\u2019s surveys have shown slightly stronger levels of activity than the City expected, and the bullish news from services sector completed the set. Chris Williamson, chief economist at IHS Markit said it was consistent with overall GDP growth of 0.4% in the April to June quarter, twice the rate seen in the first three months of the year. That 0.4% figure is key for the Bank \u2013 it is the one predicted in its models. If it actually arrives (find out later this month), it will open the door for the rate increase that Threadneedle Street has been signalling for ages but was forced to defer earlier in the year. The employment figures could still misbehave, wage growth could disappoint, or retail sales could be weak. But sunshine and football success for England are usually good for economic activity.

      "bodyText": "Nearly 600 more retail jobs are to go in the UK as the Jacques Vert, Windsmoor and Precis department store brands are wound down by administrators. Administrators said they had failed to find a buyer for Calvetron Brands, which had been restructured following a rescue deal last summer. The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday\u2019s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks &amp; Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending. A report out this week predicts nearly 70,000 high street jobs will disappear this year unless action is taken to reinvigorate town centres and revamp business rates. Calvetron, which sold clothing from 300 outlets in department stores such as Debenhams, House of Fraser, and M&amp;Co, called in administrators from Duff &amp; Phelps after struggling to cope with high costs and falling sales. Administrators had continued to trade while they sought a buyer but on Wednesday said no viable offers had been received. The closures mark the final demise of a business founded in 1972 by Jack Cynamon and Alan Green, tailors from the East End of London. In 1977 they used their names, with a French twist, to create the Jacques Vert clothing brand. The group, which was once listed on the London Stock Exchange, has been through numerous iterations. It was bought out of administration only last year by a group of businessmen led by Sandeep Vyas and Haseeb Aziz. Benjamin Wiles of Duff &amp; Phelps said: \u201cCalvetron Brands has faced the perfect storm of extremely difficult trading conditions on the high street, rising costs and low customer confidence all of which hindered our ability to secure a buyer. \u201cWe have explored a number of potential options, however no viable offers for the business as a going concern have been received. As such we are now having to close the remaining concessions here in the UK and Ireland as well as Canada and move to trade-out the stock.\u201d The concession closures will lead to 500 retail redundancies in the UK and 90 job cuts at the group\u2019s head offices in Birmingham and London. A further 250 jobs will be lost in Canada. The administrators said it would retain between 20 and 30 staff at Calvetron\u2019s head office to assist with selling final stocks.",

    "webTitle": "Ryanair crew could join pilots' strike action over pay and conditions", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ryanair crew have warned they could join pilots in taking industrial action this summer after presenting the chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, with a list of demands. Speaking after a summit in Dublin, representatives of cabin and ground crew from across Europe said there had been little progress since O\u2019Leary reversed a long-held policy of refusing to recognise trade unions more than six months ago. The intervention by crew on Wednesday comes 24 hours after about 100 pilots at Ryanair\u2019s Dublin base said they had agreed to walk out on 12 July. The Irish no-frills carrier agreed to recognise trade unions for the first time in December last year, narrowly averting widespread Christmas strikes, after a staffing crunch gave pilots the upper hand in negotiations over pay and conditions. However, pilots, cabin crew and ground crew are complaining that since then the airline has not done enough to improve their terms. The International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (ITF), a union umbrella body that represents crew at the vast majority of Ryanair\u2019s bases, listed demands after the summit ranging from improvements to economic conditions to safety and rostering and workplace culture. They also urged Ryanair to take steps to do away with more precarious agency employment, give staff the right to sick pay and end strictly enforced sales targets for products such as scratchcards. \u201cIf Ryanair fails to respond promptly and appropriately then it risks industrial action over the summer,\u201d the ITF said. Campaigns director Liz Blackshaw said O\u2019Leary\u2019s concession on trade union recognition was starting to look like an \u201cempty promise\u201d. \u201cBecause of conditions that have existed for many, many years, staff are frustrated that there isn\u2019t any significant progress. We\u2019re not expecting transformational change overnight but, given the promises made publicly in December, we\u2019d have expected some change by now. \u201cThere haven\u2019t been any and workers and unions are clear on the fact that this is unacceptable.\u201d Ryanair said the demands were \u201cpointless\u201d, listing benefits it said crew already enjoyed. \u201cRyanair is already engaged in extensive negotiations with national cabin crew unions across Europe during which all of these, and other issues, are being negotiated and we have already concluded agreements in the UK and Italy,\u201d a spokesperson said. But a trade union official in Spain said cabin crew in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Belgium from the SITCPLA union were already planning to announce dates for a walkout on Thursday. Strikes threaten to cause huge disruption for holidaymakers flying with Ryanair, Europe\u2019s largest short-haul airline by far with about 130 million passengers per year. While Ryanair has been forced to negotiate with pilots and crew, partly due to cancellations caused by persistent staff rota problems, its financial performance has been largely unaffected by labour rights disputes. The Dublin-based carrier announced a 10% rise in net profit to \u00a31.3bn in May and vowed to face down any strike action.",

Retailers said their sales reflected the wider celebratory mood, with fans watching the games from home shelling out for football parties and al fresco gatherings before games. Over the last week sales of BBQ foods, salads, ice-cream, beer, and wine have been the most popular items bought at Tesco, which predicted a further sales uplift in the run-up to England\u2019s quarter-final game with Sweden on Saturday afternoon. Demand for beer at the UK\u2019s largest retailer last week was the strongest this year, and it predicted sales would be higher this week. It also reported the best summer barbecue meat sales for several years. By the end of this week Tesco expects to have sold more than 1m burgers and,1m hot dog rolls, 6m ice lollies, around 1m tubs of ice-cream, almost 50m bottles or cans of beer and close to 1m bottles of wine. \u201cFantastic weather and the world\u2019s biggest sporting event are creating a real carnival atmosphere across Britain this week,\u201d said Tesco barbecue meats buyer, Natalie Bastow. \u201cThe mere mention of a heatwave is enough to change shopping plans and judging by sales many people are enjoying al fresco dining right now.\u201d The British Retail Consortium predicted consumers would embark on a \u00a390bn spending spree over the summer \u2013 which includes TVs and barbecues \u2013 as a buoyant mood swept the UK. At Waitrose sales of Pimm\u2019s had risen by 21% compared with the same week in 2017, sales of sparkling wine were up by 45%, beer rose by 70%, burgers and sausages were up 55% and 20% respectively. Sales of crisps and nuts rose by 13%, and ice 125%. The hot weather also triggered a week of record sales of ice lollies at Waitrose \u2013 up 188%, while sales of ice-cream cones doubled. Iceland said it set a new ice lolly sales record on the hottest day of the year so far, last Wednesday, up 340% compared with the same day in 2017. Sales of Iceland\u2019s barbecue range shot up 74%, with one of its best-selling products, a BBQ Selection Pack (\u00a35, 1.8kg) soaring by 447% on the same day. \u201cThe fantastic temperatures \u2013 and the World Cup \u2013 have meant that shoppers have been coming in their droves this week to buy frozen food and drink,\u201d said Nigel Broadhurst, Iceland\u2019s managing director. In the run-up to Saturday\u2019s crunch game, Sainsbury\u2019s is predicting a 40% increase in sales of pizza, crisps and dips, party food and snacks, compared with an average week, and a 50% uplift in beer sales. Argos expects a 80% increase in sales of barbecue sets and accessories, compared to the same period last year. In an unexpected sales increase, Marks &amp; Spencer \u2013 the official suit supplier to the England team since 2007 \u2013 said demand for waistcoats had risen 35% because of what the retailer described as \u201cthe Gareth Southgate effect\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The broadcaster Chris Packham and a a former Nasa expert who led early warnings on climate change are among scientists urging London\u2019s Science Museum to terminate its partnerships with the oil giants BP, Shell and Equinor. Packham and James Hansen are among 30 signatories of a complaint to the museum, arguing it is undermining its scientific credibility by taking money from fossil fuel companies. The group said the museum\u2019s internal reports on the oil firms, released under freedom of information rules and seen by the Guardian, show the Science Museum knew about the environmental track records of the companies but approved sponsorship deals anyway. They accuse the museum of breaching its own ethics policy, a charge the institution denies. Packham said: \u201cClimate change is upon us. We are feeling its teeth tighten and it\u2019s not just us \u2013 the world\u2019s wildlife is beginning to seriously struggle. \u201cSo I particularly dislike the fact that petrochemical companies are trying to influence young people, and the idea that they have influenced the structure and shape of Science Museum exhibitions is insidious.\u201d Hansen, who is credited with bringing climate change awareness to the wider public, said: \u201cI\u2019m supporting this complaint because until fossil fuel companies support a rising carbon fee that means they will genuinely pay for the damage they are wreaking, museums of science have a duty not to promote their brands.\u201d The complaint, organised by campaign group Culture Unstained, comes on the eve of Make the Future Live, Shell\u2019s annual \u201cfestival\u201d on energy, to be held in London\u2019s Olympic Park. Shell\u2019s contract with the museum has lapsed but its logo remains on the Science Museum\u2019s site. Equinor, the Norwegian state oil firm formerly known as Statoil, sponsors the museum\u2019s Wonderlab gallery. BP sponsors a research project called Enterprising Science. The Science Museum said all sponsorships were considered in line with its ethics policy, and partners had to accept editorial decisions rested with the museum. Ian Blatchford, director of the Science Museum Group, said: \u201cThe Science Museum Group\u2019s stance is that external sponsorship is not only necessary, it is a positive aspect of the way we work. \u201cWhile I acknowledge the passion of campaigners who would rather we turned our backs on a variety of legitimate business sectors, I strongly believe we are making the right decisions to secure the long-term future of the museum for the public good, a stance agreed by the board of trustees.\u201d The partnerships have been the target of a years-long campaign against oil companies\u2019 partnerships with cultural and scientific institutions. Critics have alleged the firms have sought to influence the Science Museum\u2019s exhibitions. The formal complaint, submitted to the museum this week, said the sponsorships \u201cundermine its integrity as a scientific institution and are in conflict with both the museum\u2019s own group ethics policy and relevant policies governing the wider museums sector\u201d. The museum\u2019s due diligence report on BP lists the Deepwater Horizon disaster, along with other oil rig explosions, pipeline leaks and pollution incidents. A similar report on Shell includes its lobbying of the Brazilian government over concerns about environmental licensing, as well as its continued membership of the American Petroleum Institute, which the museum notes is \u201calleged to obstruct climate change policies\u201d. The Statoil report largely focuses on safety issues, including North Sea gas leaks. Culture Unstained said that while the reports recognised some concerns over the companies, they also inadequately analysed the firms\u2019 contribution to climate change. \u201cConsequently,\u201d the complaint said, \u201cthe Science Museum Group has failed to undertake a \u2018careful review of proposed and ongoing relationships\u2019 as set out in appendix A of the group ethics policy.\u201d The campaigners are calling for the due diligence reporting to be improved, and for the museum to terminate contracts or commit to not renewing them when they expire.",

      "bodyText": "Crumpets are back on the menu at Warburtons after it restarted manufacturing at two factories hit by a shortage of carbon dioxide, which has affected food and drink production across the UK. Warburtons was last week forced to suspend crumpet production at two of its four bakeries \u2013 in Enfield, north London, and Burnley in Lancashire \u2013 because it did not have enough gas for use in packaging designed to keep the products fresh. Under normal circumstances, a total of 8.1m crumpets can roll off the production lines at the two factories each week. The shortage of food-grade CO2 arose from longer-than-expected shutdowns at ammonia and ethanol plants, key producers of the gas, across Europe. Three out of five key UK producers were shut down in recent weeks but two of those have restarted, enabling supplies to filter back to brewers, meat processors, fizzy drinks makers and other users of the gas. However, problems are likely to persist for at least a week as another key supplier of raw CO2, a plant run by CF Fertilisers in Ince, Cheshire, was shut after a power cut thought to be caused by a fire nearby. Air Liquide, a supplier of food grade CO2, which sources raw gas from CF Fertilisers, told its customers it was declaring \u201cforce majeure\u201d because its supplies of gas had worsened as a result of the shutdown in Cheshire, in a letter reported by The Grocer trade journal. It said reserve stocks were severely depleted and it was limiting supplies to clients. A spokeswoman said: \u201c[The Ince shutdown] is temporarily affecting the Air Liquide situation, which has worsened, but does not reflect the overall UK CO2 market situation. \u201cThe situation evolves regularly in Europe, but overall some raw CO2 plants are in a restarting mode, which should progressively allow for more CO2 supply, with a few days delay.\u201d Tearmh Taylor, consumer affairs manager at Warburtons, said: \u201cAfter a tricky couple of weeks, we have finally received a supply of CO2 and production has returned to normal at all sites. We will be back on Britain\u2019s shelves this week.\u201d However, difficulties across the market could continue for weeks. Some retailers said they continued to experience shortages of some fizzy drinks and craft beers, while the British Meat Processors Association has warned it could take up to three weeks for supplies to return to normal.",

      "bodyText": "With this, we are closing the blog for the day. Thank you for all your comments, and good-bye \u2013 we will be back tomorrow. Copper has fallen to a new nine-month low ahead of the implementation of trade tariffs by China and the US on Friday, which could hit demand for the industrial metal. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange slipped 0.6% to $6,450 per tonne, the lowest since September 2017. Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said: Trump is not fostering global trade. There is scrutiny about the export side of the market in terms of copper-containing household goods or electronics being shipped out of China and we believe that will stay with us at least until US mid-term elections in November. Let\u2019s return to trade wars. \u201cTrade wars are good and easy to win\u201d, so says Trump who last weekend railed against the EU for being as \u201cbad as China\u201d on trade practices, writes Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. The rhetoric over global trade has been ramped up in recent weeks. Hewson adds: The decision by the US to raise tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium may well protect US jobs in this particular area but it will also raise costs in the areas of the US economy that use these metals, like auto, construction and manufacturing. This will likely mean higher prices and higher inflation which in turn will hit the US consumer which at the moment, despite a tight labour market is only seeing modest wage growth. This would suggest that in seeking to protect US industry from cheap imports domestic prices could well rise causing US businesses to shed staff to cope with higher costs. In 2002 the Bush administration adopted similar measures on steel however they were abandoned after 18 months as a raft of US companies in related industries went bust as costs increased. While the US does have a point about Chinese steel dumping the scattergun effect of his trade sanctions will also serve to penalise the US\u2019s historical partners and allies, with Canada being hit the hardest. Hewson (and others) believe that trade wars are bad and usually hurt the very people they are designed to protect. The EU has retaliated with a modest range of tariffs on US imports, to the tune of \u20ac2.8bn, on goods like motor cycles, whisky and orange juice. Canada has also followed suit, and China will weigh in later this week, with the risk that the US will respond further as it targets the EU\u2019s huge automotive sector, the US being its second biggest export market. This raises the prospect of making a bad situation worse with consumers likely to bear the brunt, and while one can sympathise with the fact that the US is behaving irrationally, surely the best way to deal with the US is to play the game a different way. Tit for tat responses rarely end well, with the reactions to Smoot Hawley in the 1930\u2019s being used as a historical precedent, as rising costs impacted on domestic consumers. Furthermore, there are significant anomalies on how the EU levies tariffs on US imports, which suggests that President Trump has a point about some of the EU\u2019s trade policy. Rather than dealing with the US by way of counter punch the EU would best serve its consumers by way of engaging with the Trump administration in a more constructive fashion, holding back from kneejerk retaliation and displaying a willingness to negotiate in the expectation that we could see a ratcheting down of some of the recent trade tension that is currently spooking investors. This approach worked in 2002 when the Bush administration was forced to abandon its steel tariffs after 18 months under pressure from US businesses who were adversely affected by the increases in costs. Earlier today, it emerged that a former Rio Tinto executive has been released from a Shanghai prison, after serving eight years in jail following a 2010 conviction for corruption and stealing commercial secrets. Hu, an Australian citizen and the former head of the mining company\u2019s China iron ore business, was originally sentenced to 10 years in jail as tension flared between China, the world\u2019s top user of iron ore, and its biggest supplier, Australia. Fired by Rio in the aftermath, Hu is expected to return to Australia. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, told a daily news briefing in Beijing that Hu had been released on Wednesday. Lu said that Hu had had his sentence reduced in accordance with the law, without saying where Hu currently was nor when he might return to Australia. Here is the full story: Here\u2019s another comment on the UK services data released this morning, from Malcolm Barr at JPMorgan. The stronger-than-expected reading, which points to GDP growth of 0.4% between April and June, coupled with a pickup in inflationary pressures has cemented the view among City economists that the Bank of England will hike interest rates next month. The Markit/CIPS PMI saw the business activity reading climb to 55.1 in June, taking it back in line with the average reported since the series began in 1996. The employment component moved sideways at close to average levels, while business expectations were little changed, sitting toward the bottom end of the range seen since the Brexit referendum in 2016. Taken as a whole, the business survey data for June lend more weight to the idea that the weakness in growth reported for 1Q was temporary: our version of the composite PMI has recovered to sit slightly above its average, having been a couple of points below it in March. Indeed, the weakness in the reported IP data through to April is looking increasingly like an outlier in the data. We continue to look for the MPC to raise rates in August, and see the dataflow and recent MPC commentary as raising confidence in that view. Here\u2019s the statement in full from Beijing\u2019s finance ministry, courtesy of Reuters. The Chinese government\u2019s position has been stated many times. We absolutely will not fire the first shot, and will not implement tariff measures ahead of the United States doing so. Earlier, we thought that the Chinese tariffs on $34bn of US goods ranging from soybean to stainless steel pipes would kick in before the similarly-sized tariffs from Washington, after an unnamed source told Reuters that Beijing\u2019s tariffs would take effect at the start of the day on 6 July, and other similar media reports. Due to the 12-hour time difference, this would have put the implementation ahead of Washington\u2019s. The ministry then issued the brief statement above. Earlier, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China was ready to act, although he gave no details on the timing of tariffs. China has already made preparations. As long as the United States issues a so-called tariff list, China will take necessary measures to firmly protect its legitimate interests. China has denied that it will fire the first shot in an escalating trade dispute with the US. Beijing\u2019s finance ministry said in a statement it would not implement its tariffs on US goods before Washington\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports take effect, according to Reuters. Both sides have threatened 25% tariffs, on a combined $68bn of goods, which are due to kick in on 6 July (Friday). We are awaiting further details... Here our story on the UK outlook: A stronger-than-expected UK services reading, which suggests an improved growth outlook for Britain, has helped the pound this morning. Sterling is extending gains against the euro, rising 0.4% to 88.01p. Jennifer McKeown at Capital Economics said about the eurozone numbers: This is a sign that at least some of the weakness in the first quarter was temporary and at least suggests we are not embarking on the start of a sharp slowdown. There has been some stabilisation in the surveys if nothing else. That will reassure the ECB that a gradual normalisation of policy is warranted. Here is our full story about the impending trade war between Beijing and Washington. Over in the eurozone, it\u2019s a similar story. Business activity picked up in June, according to the latest PMI reports, making it easier for the European Central Bank to tighten policy \u2013 although it should be noted that confidence among companies declined to its lowest level since late 2016. The ECB has already set out plans to end its bond buying programme by the end of the year, dismantling the economic stimulus a decade after the eurozone\u2019s economic downturn started. However, interest rates are likely to stay on hold for quite some time, and ECB president Mario Draghi might leave office in October 2019 without having raised rates once during his eight-year term. IHS Markit\u2019s final composite purchasing managers\u2019 index for the eurozone \u2013 which combines data from manufacturing, construction and services and is seen as a good indicator of economic growth \u2013 rose to 54.9 in June from 54.1 in May, comfortably above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction. IHS Markit said this signalled second-quarter GDP of 0.5% in the eurozone (which compares with an estimated 0.4% for the UK). Services firms have not been hit as hard as manufacturers by the increasingly bitter trade dispute between the EU and the US. Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on European steel and aluminium are driving up costs for US manufacturers and exacerbating a slowdown for eurozone factories, IHS Markit\u2019s manufacturing survey showed on Monday. Markit\u2019s PMI reports suggest that UK companies grew rather faster in June than in March, when snow was dragging the economy back. Jacob Nell of Morgan Stanley says they are \u201cconsistent with a robust rebound\u201d in the second quarter of 2018: ING economist James Smith also spies a UK interest rate hike on the horizon.... Just like the manufacturing and construction indices, the latest UK services PMI has beaten expectations. At 55.1, it now stands at the highest level since October, and despite the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit, new orders are rising at the fastest rate in over a year too. This, much like the recent data emerging from the retail sector, suggests that the economy is having a better ride in the second quarter than in the first - and for the Bank of England, this will be put a fairly big tick in the August rate hike box The jump in UK service sector growth has helped the pound to shake off its early losses. Sterling has crept back over $1.32, having dropped to $1.317 earlier, as traders conclude that an August interest rate hike is now a little more likely. Balraj Sroya, Sales Trader at Foenix Partners, explains: The Services PMI print today concluded a trifecta of phenomenal PMI figures from the UK this month, posting 7-month highs at 55.1. The bullish figures from the Services, Construction and Manufacturing sectors, along with GDP beating estimates last week, prove the UK economy is gaining momentum once again. As a result, the likelihood of the Bank of England raising rates this summer has strengthened, with chances currently sitting over 60% in favour of a hike. The pick-up in growth does have a downside. Companies are struggling to find skilled staff to help them tackle their new orders. Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, explains: \u201cExceeding expectations the sector ended on a positive note at the end of the second quarter, buoyed up by the fastest rise in new orders in over a year and the strongest overall performance since last October. \u201cHowever the downside of this achievement came in the form of relentless capacity difficulties as business backlogs rose to an acute degree, not seen for around three years. Not even the minor uplift in hiring could alleviate the problem as salary pressures and the struggle to find skilled hires caused firms to hesitate to increase staff numbers further. Add increased costs for fuel, and the picture emerges of a sector experiencing the sharpest cost inflation since September last year, as well as the confidence to pass on these additional costs to their clients to maintain their margins. This is actually good news for workers, though, with some companies reporting that staff salaries have risen as they try to attract and retain employees. Today\u2019s forecast-beating services data shows that Britain has recovered from the winter slowdown - when the \u2018Beast from the East\u2019 forced school and shops to close. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, comments: \u201cThese are the best sentiment numbers for the UK services industry since October and highlight that the sector is continuing to bounce back from the weather affected Q1 that saw shops shuttered and supply lines cut. Both growth and inflation within the services sector and the wider economy are set to have risen in Q2 with the PMIs for the period hinting at a GDP number of 0.4-0.5% with inflation higher on both higher fuel and wage costs.\u201d The pick-up in growth last month will encourage the Bank of England to raise interest rates in August, suggests Capital Economics: Boom! Britain\u2019s dominant service sector has picked up pace, suggesting that UK economic growth has accelerated in the last quarter. Service sector firms enjoyed the strongest rise in activity since last October, data firm Markit reports, thanks to a rise in new orders. Companies reported a pick-up in demand, particularly from particularly for business and financial services. Some companies also got a boost from the warm weather, as consumers hit the shops. This has propelled Markit\u2019s service sector PMI up to 55.1 in June, from 54 in May. That\u2019s a stronger result than expected. Markit\u2019s surveys indicate that UK GDP rose by around 0.4% in the last three months - twice as fast as in January-March. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, explains: \u201cStronger growth of service sector activity adds to signs that the economy rebounded in the second quarter and opens the door for an August rate hike, especially when viewed alongside the news that inflationary pressures spiked higher. \u201cThe survey data indicate that the economy likely grew by 0.4% in the second quarter, up from 0.2% in the opening quarter of 2018. The sharp rise in business costs, linked to surging oil prices and the need to offer higher wages, suggests inflation will also pick up again from its current rate of 2.4%. \u201cIt remains encouraging yet also surprising that current business activity continues to show such resilience amid relatively moribund confidence regarding the year ahead outlook. The survey once again highlights how the business outlook remains clouded by widespread concerns about the impact of Brexit uncertainty in particular. Just in: Eurozone service sector growth picked up last month, suggesting Europe\u2019s economy is recovering after a weak start to 2018. Data firm Markit\u2019s eurozone services PMI has risen to 55.2, up from May\u2019s 53.8. This makes up for a slowdown at Europe\u2019s factories, where growth slowed last month. Markit says: The eurozone economy regained some traction at the end of the second quarter. Rates of expansion in output and new business accelerated, although failed to fully recover the momentum lost earlier in the year. The main impetus was provided by the services economy, which saw growth accelerate to a four-month high, offsetting a further waning in the pace of increase in manufacturing production. However, business optimism at eurozone service companies has dropped to a 19-month low. Markit cites \u201crising trade worries and political uncertainty\u201d as likely causes. Beijing policymakers will be relieved to hear that growth in China\u2019s service sector rose last month, despite trade war jitters. The monthly Chinese service sector PMI rose to 53, the highest in four months, showing accelerating growth. Service companies reported a pick-up in new orders, encouraging them to take on more staff. However, the picture is less rosy at China\u2019s manufacturing companies, where new orders fell last month. Trade war worries are hit metal prices today. Copper has dropped to a nine-month low (at $6,423 per tonne) while zinc touched its lowest level in a year. That reflects concerns that economic demand will be hurt by the looming US-China tariffs. China\u2019s stock market has dropped again today, as traders fret about the escalating trade dispute with America. The benchmark Shanghai Composite index fell 1% to finish the day at 2,760 points, its lowest closing point since March 2016. With US and China both finalising tariffs on each others goods, further jitteriness is likely. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, explains: \u201cInvestors should expect volatility to continue. Uncertainty over interest rates, protectionism, and China are key risk factors. We recommend investors stay invested, but consider five actions: looking to alternatives, hedging equity exposure, improving credit quality, diversifying sector and country risks, and taking a longer-term view.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The trade dispute between the US and China is heating up. Beiijng is preparing to impose 25% tariffs on over $30bn of American imports, including agricultural products and manufacturing items, in response to Donald Trump\u2019s own tariffs on Chinese imports which kick in on Friday. And it appears that China will actually get its retaliation first - officials are preparing to implement the tariffs from midnight on July 6, or noon Washington time tomorrow (5pm UK time). Reuters has the details: Chinese tariffs on $34bn of U.S. goods will take effect from midnight July 6 Beijing time, a person with knowledge of the plan told Reuters, amid worsening trade tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Washington has said it would implement tariffs on $34bn of Chinese imports on July 6, and Beijing has vowed to retaliate on the same day. However, the 12-hour time difference puts Beijing ahead in terms of actually implementing the tariffs. \u201cOur measures are equal and being equal means that if theU.S. starts on July 6, we start on July 6,\u201d the source told Reuters, who requested anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media. \u201cThe implementation time for all policies starts at midnight.\u201d Economists had hoped that Washington and Beijing might step away from actually imposing the tariffs they had threatened each other with. But neither side has backed down, despite the real risk that the measures will hurt growth and cost jobs. The prospect of a trade war may cast a shadow over the US today, as it celebrates Independence Day. Wall Street will be closed, so it could be a quieter day generally in the markets. European stocks are expected to dip. Also coming up today We get a healthcheck on Britain\u2019s and Europe\u2019s service sector, as data firm Markit publishes its last monthly surveys of purchasing managers. The UK\u2019s services PMI is expected to be unchanged at 54, showing steady growth. Anything higher would be a boost for the British economy, as Westminster wrestles with Brexit negotiations. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Even if service sector activity is stronger than forecast, it may fail to capture investors\u2019 attention for any significant amount of time. Brexit will be firmly back on the agenda, with the Prime Minister due to hold talks at the Chequers residence this weekend, in the hope of finding a solution to the customs partnership with the EU post Brexit. Theresa May has made a series of pleas to her bickering party to sort out their differences and to the EU, not to decline the third proposal.

Hewson adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The decision by the US to raise tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium may well protect US jobs in this particular area but it will also raise costs in the areas of the US economy that use these metals, like auto, construction and manufacturing.</p> <p>This will likely mean higher prices and higher inflation which in turn will hit the US consumer which at the moment, despite a tight labour market is only seeing modest wage growth. This would suggest that in seeking to protect US industry from cheap imports domestic prices could well rise causing US businesses to shed staff to cope with higher costs. In 2002 the Bush administration adopted similar measures on steel however they were abandoned after 18 months as a raft of US companies in related industries went bust as costs increased.</p> <p>While the US does have a point about Chinese steel dumping the scattergun effect of his trade sanctions will also serve to penalise the US\u2019s historical partners and allies, with Canada being hit the hardest.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b29192ab953c174d593a37b790dd8a03beaae81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b29192ab953c174d593a37b790dd8a03beaae81/0_300_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump arrives at Greenbrier Valley Airport on July 3 in Lewisburg, West Virginia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump arrives at Greenbrier Valley Airport on July 3 in Lewisburg, West Virginia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hewson (and others) believe that trade wars are bad and usually hurt the very people they are designed to protect.</p> <p>The EU has retaliated with a modest range of tariffs on US imports, to the tune of \u20ac2.8bn, on goods like motor cycles, whisky and orange juice. Canada has also followed suit, and China will weigh in later this week, with the risk that the US will respond further as it targets the EU\u2019s huge automotive sector, the US being its second biggest export market.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This raises the prospect of making a bad situation worse with consumers likely to bear the brunt, and while one can sympathise with the fact that the US is behaving irrationally, surely the best way to deal with the US is to play the game a different way.</p> <p>Tit for tat responses rarely end well, with the reactions to Smoot Hawley in the 1930\u2019s being used as a historical precedent, as rising costs impacted on domestic consumers. Furthermore, there are significant anomalies on how the EU levies tariffs on US imports, which suggests that President Trump has a point about some of the EU\u2019s trade policy.</p> <p>Rather than dealing with the US by way of counter punch the EU would best serve its consumers by way of engaging with the Trump administration in a more constructive fashion, holding back from kneejerk retaliation and displaying a willingness to negotiate in the expectation that we could see a ratcheting down of some of the recent trade tension that is currently spooking investors.</p> <p>This approach worked in 2002 when the Bush administration was forced to abandon its steel tariffs after 18 months under pressure from US businesses who were adversely affected by the increases in costs.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-07-04T12:28:44.026Z\">at 1.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b3cb89de4b061883625a9a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-04T12:10:43.900Z\">1.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier today, it emerged that a former Rio Tinto executive has been released from a Shanghai prison, after serving eight years in jail following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/29/rio-tinto-four-jailed-china\">a 2010 conviction for corruption and stealing commercial secrets.</a></p> <p>Hu, an Australian citizen and the former head of the mining company\u2019s China iron ore business, was originally sentenced to 10 years in jail as tension flared between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>, the world\u2019s top user of iron ore, and its biggest supplier, Australia.

The stronger-than-expected reading, which points to GDP growth of 0.4% between April and June, coupled with a pickup in inflationary pressures has cemented the view among City economists that the Bank of England will hike interest rates next month.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Markit/CIPS PMI saw the business activity reading climb to 55.1 in June, taking it back in line with the average reported since the series began in 1996. The employment component moved sideways at close to average levels, while business expectations were little changed, sitting toward the bottom end of the range seen since the Brexit referendum in 2016.</p> <p>Taken as a whole, the business survey data for June lend more weight to the idea that the weakness in growth reported for 1Q was temporary: our version of the composite PMI has recovered to sit slightly above its average, having been a couple of points below it in March. Indeed, the weakness in the reported IP data through to April is looking increasingly like an outlier in the data. We continue to look for the MPC to raise rates in August, and see the dataflow and recent MPC commentary as raising confidence in that view.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b3ca713e4b061883625a8d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-07-04T11:00:45.632Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s the statement in full from Beijing\u2019s finance ministry, courtesy of Reuters.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Chinese government\u2019s position has been stated many times.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK economy has bounced back from a soft patch in the opening months of 2018, according to a closely watched survey of the services sector that showed stronger than expected activity last month. In the latest sign that bad weather held back the economy during the first quarter, the health check by the Chartered Institute for Procurement and Supply and IHS Markit reported the strongest growth in eight months. IHS Markit\u2019s chief economist, Chris Williamson, said the improvement shown by the service sector, which accounts for just under 80% of GDP, suggested the economy would expand by 0.4% in the second quarter \u2013 double its rate of growth between January and March. A breakdown of the survey showed that demand was strong for business and financial services, while the hot weather led to a pick up in consumer spending in bars and restaurants. With the June IHS Markit/Cips surveys for manufacturing and construction also beating expectations, the City said chances of an August interest rate rise from the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) had increased. \u201cStronger growth of service sector activity adds to signs that the economy rebounded in the second quarter and opens the door for an August rate hike, especially when viewed alongside the news that inflationary pressures spiked higher,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cIt remains encouraging, yet also surprising, that current business activity continues to show such resilience amid relatively moribund confidence regarding the year ahead outlook.\u201d The IHS Markit/Cips purchasing managers\u2019 index rose from 54.0 in May to 55.1 in June, with reports of a robust and accelerated pick-up in activity. Any reading above 50 indicates that the sector is expanding. Ruth Gregory, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said it was possible the survey was underestimating the bounce-back in the economy because its findings did not include reports from retailing, where high-profile business failures were offset in recent months by falling inflation, the royal wedding and the recent fine weather. \u201cThe fact that the services survey also contained signs of a strengthening in domestically generated inflation also bolsters the chances that the MPC will press ahead and hike interest rates soon,\u201d Gregory added. Inflation was 2.4% in May and is still above the government\u2019s 2% target despite falling back in recent months. Three of the nine members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee voted for a quarter-point increase in official borrowing costs when it met last month but Threadneedle Street\u2019s quarterly update on the economy will be released in August and is seen as a more likely date for a move. However, some analysts said the Bank might again delay raising rates \u2013 as it did in May \u2013 once hard economic data came in over the next few weeks. That will include a new report from the Office for National Statistics tracking growth on a monthly basis. Dean Turner, a UK economist at UBS Wealth Management, said: \u201cOur expectation is that the data will not be strong enough to encourage the Bank to hike as soon as August.\u201d Businesses in the services sector, which include bars, restaurants and hotels, and accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy, took on new work at the fastest rate in just over a year. Firms said product launches, marketing initiatives and improving economic conditions helped increase business. But companies reiterated that Brexit-related uncertainty had held back investment, affecting spending by large companies in particular. At the same time, business costs have risen sharply on the back of surging oil prices and the need to offer higher wages. IHS Markit reported similar findings in its survey of the eurozone, where a pick-up in business activity in June pointed to 0.5% GDP growth in the second quarter, up from 0.4% in the first. Economists said this should encourage the European Central Bank to start tightening policy later this year.",

Any reading above 50 indicates that the sector is expanding.</p> <p>Ruth Gregory, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said it was possible the survey was underestimating the bounce-back in the economy because its findings did not include reports from retailing, where high-profile business failures were offset in recent months by falling inflation, the royal wedding and the recent fine weather.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that the services survey also contained signs of a strengthening in domestically generated inflation also bolsters the chances that the MPC will press ahead and hike interest rates soon,\u201d Gregory added.</p> <p>Inflation was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/13/uk-inflation-defies-expectations-by-holding-steady-at-24\">2.4% in May</a> and is still above the government\u2019s 2% target despite falling back in recent months.</p> <p>Three of the nine members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee voted for a quarter-point increase in official borrowing costs when it met last month but Threadneedle Street\u2019s quarterly update on the economy will be released in August and is seen as a more likely date for a move.</p> <p>However, some analysts said the Bank might again delay raising rates \u2013 <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/10/bank-of-england-holds-uk-interest-rates-at-05\">as it did in May</a> \u2013 once hard economic data came in over the next few weeks. That will include a new report from the Office for National Statistics tracking growth on a monthly basis.</p> <p>Dean Turner, a UK economist at UBS Wealth Management, said: \u201cOur expectation is that the data will not be strong enough to encourage the Bank to hike as soon as August.\u201d</p> <p>Businesses in the services sector, which include bars, restaurants and hotels, and accounts for about three-quarters of the UK economy, took on new work at the fastest rate in just over a year.

      "bodyText": "Pay is rising much faster for the top 1% of earners compared with those on average salaries in the richest countries, according to a report calling on governments to do more to tackle \u201cwageless growth\u201d since the financial crisis. Despite more people being in work than at any time since the onset of the banking crisis a decade ago, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said wage growth was still \u201cmissing in action\u201d across the 35 countries represented by the Paris-based group of wealthy nations. The OECD said unemployment rates are now below, or close to, pre-crisis levels across its membership base, which should give workers the right conditions to demand higher pay and better conditions. However, it warned significant pay rises remain rare and the trend growth rate for average hourly wage increases had more than halved to 2.1% from 4.8% before the crash. Launching its annual employment outlook report for 2018, Stefano Scarpetta, the OECD\u2019s director of employment, labour and social affairs, said the most worrying finding was \u201cthis unprecedented wage stagnation is not evenly distributed across workers\u201d. \u201cWhile jobs are finally back, only some fortunate few at the top are also enjoying improvements in earnings and job quality,\u201d he said. Finding multiple reasons why wage growth appears to be the missing element of the current upswing for the world economy, the OECD said one of the most important factors was the slowdown in productivity growth since the crisis. It warned the measure of growth in economic output per hour of work had dropped by about half, acting as a drag on wage rises as companies have been unable to generate higher profits with the same resources \u2013 required to pay their staff more. The Bank of England has argued wage growth in Britain should gradually begin to rise with the unemployment rate at the lowest level since the mid-1970s. However, there are few signs of wage growth. Some leading economists have warned the rise of the gig economy, part-time jobs and other precarious forms of work such as zero-hours contracts have eroded the power of employees to demand higher pay. Millions of jobs were lost during the financial crisis, and the OECD said many of the new roles people have taken in the decade since may not be as good as the ones they had before. Several governments, including Britain\u2019s, have implemented sweeping cuts to out-of-work benefits as they implement austerity measures, which could have put downward pressure on wage growth, according to the OECD. While unemployment rates have fallen dramatically, the organisation said cuts to benefits meant many workers had been forced to take worse jobs than the ones they had before the crash and as such were continuing to apply for work. When more people apply for a role, or are waiting to take a position, it diminishes the bargaining power of employees to demand higher pay. The report said: \u201cThe jobs destroyed during the crisis are not the same as those created in the recovery.\u201d As many as one-in-three jobseekers across the OECD receive unemployment benefits on average, although it said this was falling as part of a long-term downward trend since the crisis.",

      "bodyText": "The crisis on UK high streets could leave 100,000 shops empty within a decade, according to an independent review that argues struggling retailers should no longer be relied upon to prop up ailing town centres. The Grimsey Review 2 makes a series of recommendations including an overhaul of the business rates system and a ban on out-of-town developments. It predicts nearly 70,000 high street jobs will disappear this year. \u201cThere is no point clinging to a sentimental vision of the past,\u201d said Bill Grimsey, the former Wickes and Iceland chief executive who first looked at ways to revive the high street in an influential 2013 review. \u201cWe have to accept that there is already too much retail space in the UK and that bricks and mortar retailing can no longer be the anchor for thriving high streets and town centres,\u201d he said. \u201cTown centres need to be repopulated as community hubs.\u201d The report estimates that 28,000 retail jobs have disappeared in 2018 and a further 40,000 are predicted to go by the end of the year. But it says it is possible to turn things around and cites Stockton-on-Tees as a regeneration success story after stakeholders worked together to reinvigorate the north-east town. Town centres should be reinvigorated by focusing on alternatives to retail including housing, leisure, entertainment, education, arts and commercial office space, according to the report. The highest rate of retail failures and store closures since the financial crisis was recorded in the first six months of 2018 and there is no sign of a let up as consumers rein in spending on clothing and household goods and, when they do spend, increasingly shop online. The struggling House of Fraser department store chain said last month it was closing more than half its UK stores with the loss of 6,000 jobs. The list of high street casualties also includes discount chain Poundworld, Maplin and Toys R Us, which have all ceased trading. The carnage has spurred worried MPs on the housing, communities and local government committee to launch an inquiry that is considering what high streets and town centres could look like by 2030. Grimsey\u2019s original study was closely followed in Westminster. A copy was despatched to then prime minister David Cameron who, two years earlier, had asked television retail guru Mary Portas to carry out a similar exercise after being faced with record numbers of empty shops. There are 50,000 empty shops in the UK out of a total of 500,000, according to Matthew Hopkinson, a property analyst who co-authored the report with Grimsey and other experts drawn from fields including finance and regeneration. \u201cThat could rise to 100,000 within a decade if current trends continue,\u201d he said. The Grimsey Review 2, which is being launched at Wednesday\u2019s Local Government Association annual conference in Birmingham, sets out a blueprint for change that includes setting up local town centre commissions with each one tasked with drawing up a 20-year plan. The creation of a new national body \u2013 similar to the Scottish Towns Partnership \u2013 is also among the 25 recommendations in the review. Other suggestions include creating a landlord register; giving local authorities the power to fine owners whose properties are left empty for more than six months; and passing legislation enabling shops to be converted more readily into homes or community facilities such as libraries or arts venues. The report says business rates have contributed to the high street decline with last year\u2019s revaluation adding to the pain felt by half a million shopkeepers, pubs and restaurants. \u201cThere is no confidence in business rates,\u201d said Grimsey. \u201cIt is accelerating shop closures in many towns and is an outdated and unfair tax. \u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that unless drastic action is taken, things are going to get worse. There has been too much timid tinkering in the margins by Westminster and local government.\u201d",
