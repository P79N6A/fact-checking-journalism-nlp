    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is now almost nine years since HBOS failed but, if you thought our City regulators couldn\u2019t possibly spin out their inquiries any longer, you\u2019d be wrong. The next instalment \u2013 the one that will determine whether former top directors and managers of HBOS should be banned from working in the City \u2013 will be completed \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d said Andrew Bailey, head of the Financial Conduct Authority, on Tuesday. In regulator-speak, that means it\u2019s time to re-set your watch. \u201cI can\u2019t put a date on it,\u201d confirmed Bailey. To be fair to him, he can\u2019t be blamed for the delay in conducting the official inquiry, which finally landed in November 2015. Indeed, as head of the Prudential Regulation Authority at the time, he was one of the authors of the damming 400-page report that declared that \u201cultimate responsibility for the failure of HBOS rests with its board\u201d. That same report, however, left the question of sanctions against individuals in the air. Thus the FCA set out in January 2016 to determine whether executives such as former chairman Lord Stevenson and former chief executives James Crosby and Andy Hornby were personally \u201cculpable\u201d, which was the regulatory standard at the time for enforcement action. Some 18 months later, we (and the individuals) are still waiting for conclusions. The delay this time, explained Bailey, is a complication in the form of the FCA\u2019s separate HBOS inquiry arising from the fraud at the HBOS Reading branch for which six people were jailed in February. The Reading evidence will \u201cinform\u201d the main inquiry. Well, yes, we can all agree that it\u2019s best to gather all the facts and do a thorough job. But, come on, a sense of urgency is required. HBOS\u2019s ill-judged lending spree led to \u00a345bn of bad loans and the bank\u2019s failure was as bad as Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s. Nine years, and counting, is too long to wait to learn if the top brass should be barred from the City. Hurry up. Safestore\u2019s pay plan is far from defensible City fund managers tell us they will get tough with companies that propose over-the-top incentive schemes for executives. Now they have a chance to prove it. Safestore, a FTSE 250 company that offers storage space, withdrew its original proposal in March because rewards for individuals were judged too generous and performance targets too soft. Now comes the revised version, which is supposedly a compromise but looks nothing of the sort. The number of shares on offer to the executives has been cut by a fifth but Frederic Vecchioli, the chief executive, would still be able to bag \u00a38.4m-worth at the current share price if he hits his targets over the next five years. To put that in context, it\u2019s about 1% of entire company. Throw in the cut for finance director Andy Jones and 35 other managers, and Safestore is proposing that up to 3.25% of the company\u2019s shares could be handed to management as a reward. That\u2019s \u00a328.6m-worth at today\u2019s price, which is extraordinary. This is a public company, not a private equity adventure. Nor is it a giant multinational like Shell. It\u2019s a UK storage business. The Safestore chairman, Alan Lewis, argues the scheme is good for shareholders but concedes that \u201cthe current backdrop around executive remuneration and public sentiment is not conducive to such change.\u201d Actually, that\u2019s not the real problem. It\u2019s just a greedy scheme. Or, as proxy voting agency ISS puts it, \u201cthe underlying rationale remains not particularly compelling.\u201d The Investment Association has issued a \u201cred top\u201d warning signalling its concerns. Its fund managers should know what to do next week: vote against, and tell Safestore to return with a plan that belongs in the real world. Bank should have been open to persuasion on \u00a310 note The Bank of England has flunked it. Financial themes run through Jane Austen\u2019s novels but Threadneedle Street has avoided a money-related quotation on the back of the new \u00a310 note. It has opted for the well-known but dull: \u201cI declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading.\u201d As some have pointed out, the choice feels wrong because Caroline Bingley in Pride and Prejudice doesn\u2019t believe what she\u2019s saying and is just trying to impress Mr Darcy. What would have a better choice? In light of governor Mark Carney\u2019s warnings about the dangers created by the UK\u2019s \u201clost decade\u201d and the lack of growth in incomes, try this from the selfish Mary Crawford in Mansfield Park: \u201cA large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of.\u201d Provocative? Maybe. But surely perfect for a banknote.",

    "webTitle": "Ecuador risks Opec split by increasing oil output", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Ecuador has become the first country to publicly admit it will not meet Opec\u2019s production curbs, saying it needs to pump more oil to address its fiscal deficit. The South American country\u2019s promised cut of 26,000 barrels of oil a day is a tiny drop in the 1.8m b/d that the cartel recently agreed to curb until early 2018, but the decision is still the first crack in the deal\u2019s unity. \u201cThere\u2019s a need for funds for the fiscal treasury, hence we\u2019ve taken the decision to gradually increase output,\u201d oil minister Carlos Perez told local television, adding he did not think the decision would have a big impact on Opec\u2019s output. However, experts said the move could embolden other countries to rethink their commitment to the cuts. Opec producers and non-members including Russia extended but did not deepen production cuts at the end of May, and the oil price subsequently fell by 8% in June. Recent figures from the cartel show that Opec production in June was up 1.2% on May, as countries including Libya and Nigeria, which are not covered by the deal, pumped more oil. Compliance with the club\u2019s curbs has also slipped from 95% in May to 78% in June, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency. Historically, during previous Opec production curbs, compliance has weakened over time. Ecuador said it would only be able to cut 60% of its agreed reduction because of its considerable budget deficit. \u201cWe are not meeting the quota imposed on us because of the obvious needs the country has,\u201d Perez said. Despite the news from Ecuador, on Tuesday the price of a barrel of oil was up slightly at $48.67, after new figures showed demand from Chinese refineries up and a count of rigs in the US showed they were flat last week, having previously risen for several months. In the first five months of 2017, the price of oil largely sat between $50 and $55 a barrel. Joe McMonigle, of US investment research firm Hedgeye, said that while Ecuador\u2019s production was small, the decision had an impact. \u201cEcuador\u2019s exit from the Opec deal is like a rounding error due to its low production cut target,\u201d he said. \u201c But Ecuador\u2019s exit combined with Kazakhstan\u2019s intended \u2018soft exit\u2019 from the deal undermine Opec market narrative and could potentially prompt others in the deal to look for the doors.\u201d He added that both oil supply and demand in US, where drilling ramped up in the first half of the year, was crucial. \u201cCrude draws in the US now are critical to Opec\u2019s plan and can\u2019t come soon enough with production increases in Libya and continued expansion in US shale. Ecuador\u2019s decision just increases the pressure on Opec,\u201d he said. If other oil producers follow suit and renege on their production curbs, the oil price recovery since Opec\u2019s initial deal last year would almost certainly be undone. Some Opec members have called for deeper cuts this summer to tackle the oil glut and prop up prices, but Kuwait\u2019s oil minister told Reuters on Tuesday that it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to go further. The cartel\u2019s monitoring committee, which is checking compliance with the deal, is due to meet on 24 July. According to Opec\u2019s latest report, the cartel averaged 32.61m barrels a day of production in June, up 1.2% on May. Ecuador produced 570,000 of those barrels, the group said. The South American country had once been seen as a global leader and pioneer in its hopes to leave its oil in the ground, raising hundreds of millions from countries and individuals not to exploit the resource beneath the Yasun\u00ed national park. But in 2013, then president Rafael Correa scrapped the plan and last year it was confirmed drilling had begun beneath the rainforest, considered one of the most biodiverse places on Earth.",

      "bodyText": "It was a tale of banks and currencies in the markets, with investors facing losses of varying sizes almost across the board. Disappointing results from Goldman Sachs, as well as Bank of America, pushed the sector lower and undermined the rest of the market. Meanwhile, lower than expected UK inflation figures sent the pound down 0.2% but did little for the FTSE 100, suffering from falls from Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Indecision has once more reigned for the FTSE today...Much of the FTSE and sterling trade has been centred on this morning\u2019s CPI figures, which certainly gave the BoE some much needed breathing space after months of rising inflation and falling wage growth. Crucially, whilst much of the reduction in headline CPI has been attributed to falling energy prices, it is encouraging to see the core CPI figure also tumble, to 2.4%. Real incomes have been eroded in recent months, with the resulting cut in disposable income expected to hit consumer spending habits. In Europe a stronger euro has sent markets lower, ahead of this week\u2019s European Central Bank meeting. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: The key driver for European stocks appeared to be the currency, with a stronger euro weighing on appetite for equities. The euro/dollar advanced around 0.9% and eased clear of $1.15 to trade at its highest since May 2016 as the euro gained momentum from fresh dollar softness in the wake of the health bill failure. The euro/dollar is now eyeing the May 3 high above $1.16 and, if breached, could start to target the $1.17 handle last seen in August 2015. A lot hinges on some pretty subtle language and shifts in tone by Mario Draghi and the ECB on Thursday. A removal of the easing bias in the policy statement could be enough to push it higher but we must prepare for Mr Draghi to don his dovish cap and talk down the currency lest a stronger euro gets in the way of the ECB\u2019s outlook. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 13.91 points or 0.19% at 7390.22 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.25% lower at 12,430.39 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.09% to 5173.27 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.59% to 21,358.20 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.19% at 10,524.5 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.17% to 848.07 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 79 points or 0.37%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. After the launch of the \u00a310 in Winchester, where he said nothing about the day\u2019s inflation figures, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has been speaking to Sky about that very subject. He said the figures were consistent with the Bank\u2019s forecast that inflation would overshoot its target for some time, and the big picture remained the same: the fall in the pound pushing up prices. The FTSE 100 has slipped back after the weaker than expected inflation figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down on disappointing results and the latest setback for President Trump, but the real declines are in Europe due to the strength of the euro. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, says: Over in the eurozone the Dax and Cac had a serious currency headache, dropping 1.4% and 1.1% respectively. That\u2019s because the euro\u2019s sterling-gains were joined by a similarly strong performance against the dollar, where it surged 0.9% to a fresh 2 and a half month high, now sitting just shy of $1.16. Back with the US and some more disappointing economic figures, this time from the housing market. The National Association of Home Builders housing index slipped from 66 in June to 64 this month, lower than the expected figure of 67. This is the lowest reading since last November. NAHB chairman Granger MacDonald said: Our members are telling us they are growing increasingly concerned over rising material prices, particularly lumber. This is hurting housing affordability even as consumer interest in the new-home market remains strong. Spain\u2019s economic recovery remains strong but the country still needs structural reforms to cope with any future economic shocks, says the International Monetary Fund, which has also upgraded its growth forecast. In its latest report it said: Spain\u2019s economic recovery remains strong, with consumption, investment, and net exports all contributing to a more balanced growth pattern. A shift in resources toward Spain\u2019s competitive export sector, with the services sector creating most new jobs, has played an important part in the rebound. Banking sector balance sheets are stronger, private sector debt is coming down, and credit availability is improving. As the recovery is maturing, it is time to tackle the remaining vulnerabilities related to elevated public debt and complete the still-ongoing post-crisis banking sector adjustment. At the same time, reducing structural unemployment and fostering productivity growth remain priorities. Without farther determined progress on structural reforms and rebuilding of fiscal buffers, the economy would remain vulnerable to shocks and risk leaving some segments of the population behind. The IMF has raised its economic growth forecast from 2.6% this year to 3.1%, saying: Real GDP is projected to grow by 3.1 percent this year, and there is upside risk as the momentum created by past reforms may be bigger than estimated. But it added: [Challenges} need to be fully addressed to offset the expected slow-down in medium-term growth and to build greater resilience. Public debt and structural unemployment are still high, population aging is creating fiscal pressures, and productivity lags that of EU peers. In addition, Spain\u2019s net debtor position with the rest of the world remains large, and financial sector adjustment and further reforms to strengthen and modernize the institutional arrangements are yet to be fully completed. The latest setback for Donald Trump and his healthcare plans has prompted speculation the President will struggle to get other measures passed - notably tax reform - and unsettled investors. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 62 points or 0.29%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are down similar amounts. Healthcare companies were under pressure while uninspiring results from Bank of America and Goldman Sachs saw their shares slip back. But Netflix has jumped nearly 10% after the streaming service topped 100m subscribers, helped by growth outside the US. Here is our report on the launch, from Steven Morris. And the Bank\u2019s press release and Carney\u2019s comments are here. So far no economic commentary from Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who has been praising Austen and putting the new tenner in the context of the history of banknotes. The unveiling of the \u00a310 note is underway and can be seen live here. Later this afternoon, Bank of England governor Mark Carney is at Winchester Cathedral to launch the new polymer \u00a310 note featuring Jane Austen. Given the day\u2019s inflation figures and the implications for interest rates, it will be interesting to see what, if any, comments he makes on the UK economy. The launch of the plastic fiver last June came not long before the EU referendum, so Carney stuck to the subject of banknotes rather than wider economic issues. The pound is still on the slide after the weaker than expected inflation figures suggested a Bank of England rate rise could be some way off. Against the dollar, sterling is now down 0.3% at $1.3016 and 0.9% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1265. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga reckons the pound could fall further: The fact that sterling sharply depreciated across the board on Tuesday, after British inflation rates unexpectedly dropped to 2.6% in June, continues to highlight how the currency has become increasingly sensitive to monetary policy speculation. Price action suggests that those who were heavily reliant on the possibility that higher rates would support sterling further were left empty-handed, as deceleration in inflation eroded expectations of a UK rate increase in 2017. Although the Bank of England has adopted a hawkish tone in recent weeks, today\u2019s fall in inflation is likely to ease pressure on the Bank of England taking action, consequently keeping hawks at bay... Investors should keep in mind that the fundamentals behind sterling\u2019s woes remain intact, with sellers potentially exploiting rate hike speculations and dollar weakness to install fresh rounds of selling. From a technical standpoint, a decisive breakdown and daily close below 1.3000 should encourage a further decline towards 1.2850. Time for a recap, for those of just tuning in. UK inflation fell unexpectedly in June for the first time in nine months as lower fuel prices provided some respite for cash-strapped consumers. The consumer prices index fell to 2.6% from a four-year high of 2.9% in May according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists had expected the rate to be unchanged. The fall was mainly driven by lower petrol and diesel prices, reflecting weaker global oil prices. Fuel prices fell by 1.1% between May and June, compared with a 2.2% rise over the same month a year earlier. Lower prices of games and toys also contributed to the fall. However, at 2.6% inflation is still well above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, and signalled a sustained fall in real wages as prices rise faster than current pay growth of 2%..... Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said the government must act to halt the decline in living standards. \u201cThe government must stop this cost of living squeeze. Many working people are caught in a vice as rising prices crush their pay. Ministers claim they are listening to struggling families. But now is the time to prove it. Britain needs a pay rise across the public and private sector.\u201d A spokesperson for the Treasury acknowledged that some households were struggling financially. \u201cWhile it is encouraging that inflation was lower this month, we appreciate that some families are concerned about the cost of living. That\u2019s why we have introduced the national living wage, which is helping to boost earnings by \u00a31,400 a year, and why we\u2019ve cut taxes for millions of people to help them keep more of what they earn. We are also increasing our free childcare offer to help 400,000 working parents.\u201d.... Here\u2019s Angela Monaghan\u2019s news story on the data: Here\u2019s a reminder of the key charts: Economists have warned that families still face a cost of living squeeze. Maike Currie of Fidelity International says: Our pay packets aren\u2019t keeping up with rising prices despite the UK\u2019s unemployment rate reaching its lowest level since 1975. This is tightening the squeeze on UK households, which is bad news for an economy that relies on confident consumers spending on goods and services. Calum Bennie of Scottish Friendly adds: \u201cDespite a drop in the headline rate of inflation, many families will still be facing the same relentless pressure to make ends meet. The cost of food, household goods and furniture all became more expensive in June and with wage growth still flat those at the bottom will continue to turn to credit or rapidly deplete savings just to keep food on the table. Sterling sharply when the data was released. It has subsided further as traders concluded that UK interest rates are now less likely to rise this year. The pound is now trading at $1.3010, a whole cent lower than early this morning. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, says consumers should cheer today\u2019s inflation data: Firstly, it means the squeeze on real incomes in 2017 and 2018 will be less severe and less pronounced than some have feared. Secondly, it removes the threat of an interest rate rise from the Bank of England. An August increase in the cost of borrowing, while never looking all that likely, is now off the agenda. Here\u2019s his full analysis: Danske Bank economist Conor Lambe fears that Britain\u2019s wage squeeze is hurting economic growth. And we could get the proof next Wednesday, when growth figures for the April-June quarter is released. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s inflation figures: \u201cThe CPI inflation rate in the UK was 2.6 per cent in June 2017, lower than the 2.9 per cent observed in May. This fall was mainly due to lower fuel prices. \u201cThe latest labour market data showed that the rate of nominal wage growth over the year to March-May 2017 was 2 per cent. Therefore, despite today\u2019s fall in the inflation rate, real wage growth is still in negative territory. \u201cAbove target inflation, and the accompanying negative real wage growth, is continuing to squeeze UK consumers and this is likely to be reflected in next week\u2019s preliminary estimate of GDP growth in the second quarter of this year.\u201d Here\u2019s a handy chart, showing how expectations of a UK interest rate rise this year have fallen: The Office for National Statistics has also reported that house price inflation has slowed. Average house prices in the UK rose by 4.7% in the year to May 2017, down from 5.3% in the year to April 2017. This could be another sign that the economy is slowing, and that households are feeling the squeeze from inflation and weak wage growth. The East of England saw the fastest growth, at 7.5% year on year. The lowest annual growth was in the North East, where prices increased by 1.6% over the year, followed by London at 3.0%. On a regional basis, London continues to be the region with the highest average house price at \u00a3481,000, followed by the South East and the East of England, which stand at \u00a3316,000 and \u00a3284,000 respectively. The lowest average price continues to be in the North East at \u00a3127,000. Despite the slowdown in London, prices across the capital have outstripped the rest of the country since the last recession: Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Nick Leung, research analyst at fund manager WisdomTree, says there are three reasons inflation dropped last month: \u201cToday\u2019s inflation reading is slightly softer than expected, underpinned by a combination of oil price weakness, a stabilising pound and import-cost induced inflationary pressures undermining consumers\u2019 debt-fuelled spending power.\u201d As long as wages are subdued, rising inflation is clearly bad news for families. James Brown, Partner and head of the UK Consumer &amp; Retail practice at Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners, explains why: June is the fifth consecutive month where inflation was above the Bank of England target of 2%, and also considerably higher than the 0.5% level recorded in June last year..... The current rate adds more than \u00a350 extra a month to UK households\u2019 monthly expenses covered by CPI compared to the same time last year, putting more pressure on holidays and summer outings budgets. The fall in the value of the pound last June has made foreign holidays much more expensive. But even those who say at home will feel the pinch. Brown explains: Whether families decide to register the children to a kids\u2019 club or summer camp, or whether groups of friends meet for drinks, they will have to pay more for it than they did last year. The figures for June showed that fees for recreational and sporting services went up by 3.5% and beer is 7.5% more expensive than last year. Britain\u2019s inflation target is 2%, so the Bank of England still faces some pressure to consider raising interest rates to push down the cost of living. Calum Bennie, Scottish Friendly\u2019s savings specialist, explains: \u201cDespite a drop in the headline rate of inflation, many families will still be facing the same relentless pressure to make ends meet. The cost of food, household goods and furniture all became more expensive in June and with wage growth still flat those at the bottom will continue to turn to credit or rapidly deplete savings just to keep food on the table. As long as this squeeze continues the Bank of England faces a difficult balancing act. While on the one hand raising interest rates may help to combat inflation, on the other it will cause real pain for homeowners who could see the cost of their mortgages rise.\u201d The drop in inflation in June may show that the cost of living squeeze is rippling through the economy, and making it hard for shops to raise prices. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Markets explains: The slowdown in inflation suggests that the decline in British real wages may have started to translate into a slower consumer inflation, as anticipated by the Bank of England (BoE) Governor Mark Carney. Here\u2019s the Treasury\u2019s comment on today\u2019s inflation figures: \u2018While it is encouraging that inflation was lower this month, we appreciate that some families are concerned about the cost of living. That\u2019s why we have introduced the National Living Wage, which is helping to boost earnings by \u00a31,400 a year, and why we\u2019ve cut taxes for millions of people to help them keep more of what they earn. We are also increasing our free childcare offer to help 400,000 working parents.\u2019 No mention of the public sector pay cap, though, which has caused public splits within Theresa May\u2019s cabinet. The Unison union is also alarmed that wages are still being eroded by rising cost of living. UNISON assistant general secretary Christina McAnea says public sector workers deserve better: \u201cWith inflation much higher than wages, nurses, teaching assistants and care staff are getting poorer. \u201cThe government\u2019s harsh approach to public sector pay is completely out of step with the public mood. \u201cEvery day the pay cap stays, public sector employees are leaving for better paid jobs elsewhere. And it gets that bit harder for the NHS, police forces, schools and town halls to recruit new staff. \u201cThe Chancellor should show he understands the financial struggles of millions of families and end the pay cap now.\u201d Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the odds of a UK interest rate rise in August have shrunk. He writes: UK inflation fell unexpectedly in June to 2.6%, easing the pressure on squeezed household budgets and substantially reducing the likelihood of an August interest rate rise. The ONS said the drop was largely due to falling motor fuel prices, although core inflation \u2013 which strips out the more volatile components such as fuel and food \u2013 also fell, to 2.4%. The news sent the pound sharply lower as currency traders adjusted their outlook for interest rates. The Bank of England\u2019s rhetoric has taken an increasingly hawkish tone in recent weeks, with Mark Carney himself saying at the end of last month that \u201csome removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary\u201d. Chief economist Andy Haldane also indicated he might support a rate rise this year. However if today\u2019s pullback in inflation marks the start of a sustained decline, the pressure on the Bank to raise rates will ease. You can read the inflation report online, here. This chart shows clearly how UK pay packets aren\u2019t keeping up with the cost of living, despite June\u2019s unexpected drop in inflation. It\u2019s via Maike Currie, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International. She says there\u2019s little to cheer in today\u2019s inflation report: \u201cToday\u2019s inflation numbers show CPI inflation rising from 0.5% in June 2016 to 2.6% a year later - that\u2019s more than a five-fold increase in only a year. While inflation has eased back from May\u2019s reading of 2.9%, thanks largely to a fall in the oil price driving down the cost of fuel, this will be cold comfort for Britain\u2019s cash strapped consumers - inflation is still well above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target rate and outpacing our earnings. \u201cLast week\u2019s wage growth figures show regular pay growing at just 2.0% for the three months to May, confirming that our pay packets aren\u2019t keeping up with rising prices despite the UK\u2019s unemployment rate reaching its lowest level since 1975. This is tightening the squeeze on UK households, which is bad news for an economy that relies on confident consumers spending on goods and services. Retail sales figures out on Thursday will provide a telling health check on just how spending is fairing given the mounting pressure on British households. No prizes for spotting the moment that the inflation data was released..... Katie Schmuecker of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says the inflation squeeze is hitting poorer Britons the hardest: TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady isn\u2019t celebrating the drop in inflation. She points out that Britons are still suffering from falling real wages, and urges the government to ditch its 1% cap on public sector pay rises. O\u2019Grady says: \u201cThe government must stop this cost of living squeeze. Many working people are caught in a vice as rising prices crush their pay. \u201cMinisters claim they are listening to struggling families. But now is the time to prove it. Britain needs a pay rise across the public and private sector.\u201d ITV\u2019s Robert Peston reckons that inflation has been dampened by the slowing UK economy: This is the biggest drop in inflation in over two years, points out Jamie McGeever of Reuters: Kevin Maguire of the Mirror points out that the retail prices index (another measure of inflation) hit 3.5% in June: This chart shows how the cost of transport, and recreation activities, both dropped last month: Fuel prices fell by 1.1% between May and June 2017, the fourth successive month of price decreases. There was also a 0.1% drop in recreation - which includes cultural services, and games, toys and hobbies. However, as you can see, food, furniture and household goods all got more expensive during June. And on an annual basis, almost everything is more expensive than a year ago: The pound has fallen sharply since the inflation data was released, shedding all this morning\u2019s gains. Sterling has dropped to $1.3028, almost a cent lower. City traders think there\u2019s less chance of an early rise in UK interest rates. This is the first time UK inflation has fallen since last October. This chart shows how the consumer prices index (in yellow) had rising pretty steadily since last summer: The drop in inflation last month is mainly due to falling petrol prices, says the Office for National Statistics. Breaking! Britain\u2019s inflation rate has fallen to 2.6% in June, down from 2.9% in May. That\u2019s a smaller reading than expected; City has expected inflation to remain at last month\u2019s four-year high. But it still means that living standards are being squeezed, as wages are only rising by 2% (according to the latest data, released last week). More to follow! Tension is rising in the City, as traders get ready for the inflation figures to hit the wires.... If inflation remains at a four-year high of 2.9% in June, or even goes higher, it will intensify the debate about when UK interest rates should rise (for the first time since 2007). Danny Blanchflower and Andrew Sentance, both former members of the Bank\u2019s rate setting monetary policy, (and long-term opponents in economic theory) have been outlining their differing views on the BBC\u2019s Radio 4 Today programme. Sentance says the Bank should follow the US Fed\u2019s example and raise rates immediately: \u201cI think inflation is going to go up eventually this year to over 3% and that\u2019s squeezing the living standards of workers and people throughout the economy and I think the worry that I would have is that the bank of England hasn\u2019t responded at all to this situation. It can do something about it. If it gradually raised interest rates that would help support the value of the pound so we would get less imported inflation and that might take some of the pressure off consumers.\u201d Blanflower on the other hand thinks a rate rise now would be a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d. \u201cHere Andrew goes again he\u2019s been saying the same thing for the last 10 years. This is precisely the wrong thing to do. \u201cWhy would you want to have a self-inflicted wound at a time when Brexit negotiations is taking place, we\u2019ve no idea how it\u2019s going to be resolved and that\u2019s obviously a big problem, firms are sitting thinking what the heck is going to happen. So if you start to raise rates now this is precisely the wrong time to do it. Waiting and watching is sensible. My suspicion is this inflation is temporary and it will start to drop away.\u201d Zing! The pound just hit a fresh 10-month high against the US dollar. Sterling nudged $1.3126 for the first time since September 2016, as Trump\u2019s healthcare setbacks continue to weaken the dollar. City broker Panmure Gordon hopes that the worst of Britain\u2019s inflation surge may be coming to an end. They told clients this morning that the jump in import prices, following the Brexit vote, seems to have peaked a few months ago. That should mean that inflationary pressures ease a little. Here\u2019s a snapshot of their note: Economist Rupert Seggins is tweeting some useful charts on inflation: Some City economists have predicted that UK inflation could rise to 3% this morning. If so, that could send the pound soaring as it would intensify the pressure on the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says: If headline inflation hits 3% or above, this will indicate a high chance of hiking rates when the BoE meets in August. However, if the numbers pull back, this would ease pressure on the central bank and traders will turn their attention to the Brexit talks. The pound has risen over $1.31 in early trading, up almost half a cent. That\u2019s close to last week\u2019s 10-month high, ahead of today\u2019s inflation report. Most currencies are gaining ground against the US dollar this morning, after president Trump\u2019s attempts to shake up America\u2019s healthcare system hit another roadblock. Overnight, two senators declared they wouldn\u2019t support Trump\u2019s push to repeal Obamacare. So, with veteran lawmaker John McCain recovering from surgery, the Republicans simply don\u2019t have the votes....especially as some senators fear that millions of Americans, especially with pre-existing conditions, would suffer if the Affordable Care Act was repealed. This has hurt the dollar, as it undermines hopes that Trump could deliver tax reforms or a big new infrastructure spending programme. This has sent the euro rallying to its highest level against the US dollar since May 2016. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The cost of living squeeze is one of the hottest topics in Britain today, thanks to the decline in the pound last year and the government\u2019s public sector pay squeeze. So the main event today is the latest inflation figures, due at 9.30am today. They\u2019re all-but-certain to show that prices are rising faster than wages. Economists predict that the Consumer Prices Index will hit 2.9% for June, matching May\u2019s figure. That would mean that real wages are continuing to shrink, as basic pay is currently only growing by 2% per year. Prices are being driven up by the slump in the pound last June, which makes imports much dearer. So today\u2019s figures will also show the impact of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Economics predicts that food prices drove inflation up last month: Inflation has surged over the Bank of England\u2019s official target of 2% in recent months, as our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: Inflation was running at 0.6% when the UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016 but it has risen subsequently as a result of higher oil prices and dearer imports caused by the 12% decline in the value of the pound over the past 12 months. That has taken the annual inflation rate to its highest level in four years and close to the level where Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, would be forced to write a letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, explaining why Threadneedle Street had failed to keep the annual increase in the cost of living to within one percentage point of the government\u2019s 2% target. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s preview: The ONS will also publish its latest house price index, which may show that prices rose at a slower pace in May. And over at Winchester cathedral, the Bank of England is preparing to unveil the final design of its new polymer \u00a310 note. We already know it will feature Jane Austen, 200 years after the author\u2019s death.

Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Indecision has once more reigned for the FTSE today...Much of the FTSE and sterling trade has been centred on this morning\u2019s CPI figures, which certainly gave the BoE some much needed breathing space after months of rising inflation and falling wage growth. Crucially, whilst much of the reduction in headline CPI has been attributed to falling energy prices, it is encouraging to see the core CPI figure also tumble, to 2.4%. Real incomes have been eroded in recent months, with the resulting cut in disposable income expected to hit consumer spending habits.</p> </blockquote> <p>In Europe a stronger euro has sent markets lower, ahead of this week\u2019s European Central Bank meeting. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The key driver for European stocks appeared to be the currency, with a stronger euro weighing on appetite for equities. The euro/dollar advanced around 0.9% and eased clear of $1.15 to trade at its highest since May 2016 as the euro gained momentum from fresh dollar softness in the wake of the health bill failure.</p> <p>The euro/dollar is now eyeing the May 3 high above $1.16 and, if breached, could start to target the $1.17 handle last seen in August 2015. A lot hinges on some pretty subtle language and shifts in tone by Mario Draghi and the ECB on Thursday. A removal of the easing bias in the policy statement could be enough to push it higher but we must prepare for Mr Draghi to don his dovish cap and talk down the currency lest a stronger euro gets in the way of the ECB\u2019s outlook. </p> </blockquote> <p>The final scores showed:<strong><br></strong></p> <ul> <li><strong> The FTSE 100 finished down 13.91 points or 0.19% at 7390.22<br></strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed 1.25% lower at 12,430.39</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.09% to 5173.27</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.59% to 21,358.20</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.19% at 10,524.5</strong></li> <li><strong>In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.17% to 848.07</strong></li> </ul> <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 79 points or 0.37%.</p> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening.

A shift in resources toward Spain\u2019s competitive export sector, with the services sector creating most new jobs, has played an important part in the rebound. Banking sector balance sheets are stronger, private sector debt is coming down, and credit availability is improving. As the recovery is maturing, it is time to tackle the remaining vulnerabilities related to elevated public debt and complete the still-ongoing post-crisis banking sector adjustment. At the same time, reducing structural unemployment and fostering productivity growth remain priorities. Without farther determined progress on structural reforms and rebuilding of fiscal buffers, the economy would remain vulnerable to shocks and risk leaving some segments of the population behind. </p> </blockquote> <p>The IMF has raised its economic growth forecast from 2.6% this year to 3.1%, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Real GDP is projected to grow by 3.1 percent this year, and there is upside risk as the momentum created by past reforms may be bigger than estimated.</p> </blockquote> <p>But it added:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Challenges} need to be fully addressed to offset the expected slow-down in medium-term growth and to build greater resilience.

Although the Bank of England has adopted a hawkish tone in recent weeks, today\u2019s fall in inflation is likely to ease pressure on the Bank of England taking action, consequently keeping hawks at bay...</p> <p>Investors should keep in mind that the fundamentals behind sterling\u2019s woes remain intact, with sellers potentially exploiting rate hike speculations and dollar weakness to install fresh rounds of selling.

    "webTitle": "Jane Austen banknote unveiled \u2013 with strange choice of quotation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The new \u00a310 note featuring Jane Austen has been unveiled on the 200th anniversary of the author\u2019s death, complete with a quote about reading \u2013 said by one of her characters who has no interest in books. Austen becomes the first female writer (following in the footsteps of William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens) to feature on a banknote. The note, launched by the Bank of England at Austen\u2019s resting place, Winchester Cathedral, includes an image of the writer and one of her most beloved characters, Elizabeth Bennet. There are also illustrations of her writing table and her brother Edward Austen Knight\u2019s home, Godmersham Park in Kent, thought to be a source of inspiration. But it is the quote that will raise eyebrows among Austen enthusiasts. At first glance the line from Pride and Prejudice \u2013 \u201cI declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!\u201d \u2013 seems a good choice. However, the words were spoken by one of Austen\u2019s most deceitful characters, Caroline Bingley, who has no interest in books. She is sidling up to Mr Darcy, whom she would like as a husband. He is reading a book, so she sits next to him and pretends to read alongside him. Speaking at Winchester Cathedral, the Bank of England\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, explained why Austen was chosen \u2013 and the technical aspects of the notes. He said: \u201cOur banknotes serve as repositories of the country\u2019s collective memory, promoting awareness of the United Kingdom\u2019s glorious history and highlighting the contributions of its greatest citizens. \u201cAusten\u2019s novels have a universal appeal and speak as powerfully today as they did when they were first published.\u201d Turning to practical matters, he said: \u201cThe new \u00a310 will be printed on polymer, making it safer, stronger and cleaner. The note will also include a new tactile feature on the \u00a310 to help the visually impaired, ensuring the nation\u2019s money is as inclusive as possible.\u201d It joins the Churchill \u00a35 in the first family of polymer UK banknotes; a \u00a320 note featuring JMW Turner will follow in 2020. The \u00a310 note has security features that the Bank says make it very difficult to counterfeit. It is expected to last at least two-and-a-half times longer than paper \u00a310 notes \u2013 about five years in total. The new tactile feature is a series of raised dots in the top left-hand corner, developed in conjunction with the RNIB, the charity that supports people with sight loss. This is in addition to the elements already incorporated in UK banknotes for visually impaired people: the tiered sizing, bold numerals, raised print and differing colour palettes. Austen fans will have to wait until later this year before they can begin to use the notes. They will be issued on 14 September and the public will begin to see them in the following days and weeks. The Bank hopes featuring Austen will help it counter accusations of sexism for not featuring more women on notes. The author follows Florence Nightingale and Elizabeth Fry in featuring on notes. Tuesday\u2019s banknote launch is one of a series of events taking place to mark the 200th anniversary of Austen\u2019s death, including the unveiling of a statue in Basingstoke, near her birthplace. Austen, who wrote keenly about money, might have been interested in research from Aviva claiming that the \u00a310 pound note has a relative purchasing power of only 13p compared with what it could buy in 1817.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rising inflation has been one of the big economic stories of the past year. The depreciation of sterling after the EU referendum has made the things Britain imports, such as clothes and food, dearer and the cost of living has risen steadily as a result. The drop in the annual inflation rate to 2.6% in June was a welcome surprise. Two years ago, inflation was zero; in the month of the Brexit vote it was 0.5%. By May it had risen to 2.9%, with many City analysts confident that it would breach the 3% barrier within the next couple of months. Last month\u2019s fall, while much bigger than anybody in the financial markets was expecting, does not mean that inflation has reached a turning point. The coming months are likely to see some further moves upwards in the cost of living, but in the absence of a fresh fall in the value of the pound or a spike in oil prices the peak is not that far away. That will be good for consumers in two respects. Firstly, it means the squeeze on real incomes in 2017 and 2018 will be less severe and less pronounced than some have feared. Secondly, it removes the threat of an interest rate rise from the Bank of England. An August increase in the cost of borrowing, while never looking all that likely, is now off the agenda. There are still lagged effects of the fall in the pound but they are now fading. Official figures for producer prices are a good guide to inflationary pressure early in the pipeline because they measure how much industry is paying for fuel and raw materials, and how much it is charging for goods when they leave factories. At their peak in January, industry\u2019s fuel and raw material bills were increasing at an annual rate of 19.9% but since then the rate of increase has halved to 9.9%. Similarly the cost of goods leaving factory gates was at its highest, 3.7%, in February and March but has now slipped back to 3.3%. It would be unwise, given Britain\u2019s issues down the years, to say inflation is a problem solved. Opec could find a way of making an oil-price rise stick. Workers in the UK could find a way of securing more generous pay awards. Neither, though, looks particularly likely. This is the 2010s not the 1970s.",

      "bodyText": "Inflation fell unexpectedly in June for the first time in nine months as lower fuel prices provided some respite for cash-strapped consumers. The consumer prices index fell to 2.6% from a four-year high of 2.9% in May according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists had expected the rate to be unchanged. The fall was mainly driven by lower petrol and diesel prices, reflecting weaker global oil prices. Fuel prices fell by 1.1% between May and June, compared with a 2.2% rise over the same month a year earlier. Lower prices of games and toys also contributed to the fall. However, at 2.6% inflation is still well above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, and signalled a sustained fall in real wages as prices rise faster than current pay growth of 2%. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said the government must act to halt the decline in living standards. \u201cThe government must stop this cost of living squeeze,\u201d she said. \u201cMany working people are caught in a vice as rising prices crush their pay. Ministers claim they are listening to struggling families. But now is the time to prove it. Britain needs a pay rise across the public and private sector.\u201d A spokesperson for the Treasury acknowledged that some households were struggling financially. \u201cWhile it is encouraging that inflation was lower this month, we appreciate that some families are concerned about the cost of living. That\u2019s why we have introduced the national living wage, which is helping to boost earnings by \u00a31,400 a year, and why we\u2019ve cut taxes for millions of people to help them keep more of what they earn. We are also increasing our free childcare offer to help 400,000 working parents.\u201d Inflation has risen rapidly since the EU referendum in June last year, when the consumer prices index was just 0.5%. The surprise Brexit vote triggered a sharp fall in the value of the pound and drove up the cost of goods imported from abroad, making shop prices more expensive. The pound fell half a cent against the dollar to $1.3020 after the inflation data was published on Tuesday, as investors believed it lessened the likelihood of a rise in UK interest rates in 2017. The last time the Bank of England raised rates was in July 2007, before the global financial crisis took hold, and rates are currently at an all-time low of 0.25%. \u201cToday\u2019s data casts doubt over a rate hike later this year,\u201d said James Smith, an economist at ING. \u201cEven if inflation does recover, the decision to hike rates still hinges on the growth outlook. \u201cBank of England governor Mark Carney recently suggested that the Bank needs to see stronger investment and a recovery in wage growth before tightening policy. But political uncertainty, the deteriorating outlook for consumer spending and rising cost bases from higher import prices mean that both look unlikely to materialise.\u201d Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee and a senior economic adviser at the accountancy firm PwC, said inflation was likely to rise again in the coming months, reaching at least 3% in the second half of the year as the fall in the pound works its way through to shop prices. \u201cWe have not necessarily passed the peak of inflation,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers felt some respite from the inflation squeeze last month, but price rises are still likely to run ahead of wage increases for the rest of this year \u2013 continuing the current consumer squeeze and holding back economic growth.\u201d Sentance said the Bank should follow the US Federal Reserve by starting to gradually raise interest rates. \u201cIf the Bank gradually raised interest rates that would help support the value of the pound so we would get less imported inflation and that might take some of the pressure off consumers,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme before the inflation figures were published. However, David Blanchflower, another former member of the MPC and a professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, said now is \u201cprecisely the wrong time\u201d to raise UK rates. \u201cWhy would you want to have a self-inflicted wound at a time when Brexit negotiations are taking place,\u201d he said. \u201c\u00a7We have no idea how it\u2019s going to be resolved and that\u2019s obviously a big problem.

      "bodyText": "Homebuyers could take out bigger mortgages if the energy ratings of properties were factored into the lending criteria of banks and building societies, government-funded research has found. Although estate agents are legally bound to display energy performance certificates (EPCs) in property listings, few buying decisions hinge on energy bill costs and the efficiency of a home is not considered in affordability calculations by lenders. However, if the A-G rating of the EPC was part of the calculation it would allow people to borrow \u00a34,000 more in many cases and up to \u00a311,500 in extreme ones, according to analysis by the Nationwide Building Society, Arup and building groups. Even if buyers did not borrow the extra money, they would be attracted by the \u201cperception of value\u201d implied by the higher limits, the research said. Well-insulated homes would eventually sell more quickly and command a modest price premium. The idea is the latest in a string of mooted incentives to encourage people to insulate their homes and nudge buyers towards greener properties, such as a discount on stamp duty for energy efficient homes. Experts said the proposal could be a \u201cmajor driver\u201d in linking energy performance to house prices, and ministers called the work a \u201ctimely and valuable contribution\u201d. Richard Twinn, a policy adviser at the UK Green Building Council, said: \u201cThis new research shows that if lenders use information about a property\u2019s energy performance when making lending decisions, this could encourage homebuyers to choose more efficient homes by increasing the size of mortgage available for these properties.\u201d The report by the Lenders group, which includes the Principality Building Society and UCL Energy Institute, examined data from about 40,000 properties to model how much different EPCs would free up expenditure on energy for a bigger mortgage instead. Most mortgage lenders today use Office for National Statistics data on energy bills, based on a smaller dataset of properties, and sometimes also obtain data from customers on their actual spending on gas and electricity. But the figures do not reflect the efficiency of the property being bought and so as the report notes: \u201cpast fuel bills may well not represent future fuel bills\u201d. The difference between an A- and G-rated home would be as much as \u00a311,500 in extra borrowing, the analysis found, falling to about \u00a34,000 extra on a mortgage offer between an E- and C-rated property. The Lenders group said that because energy bills were a sizeable part of borrowers\u2019 essential expenditure, it was a component of the affordability calculation that warranted being made more sophisticated. However, it admitted that incorporating the changes would not be straightforward due to the complexity of lenders\u2019 systems. Making the proposal a reality would provide a major boost for the insulation and building industry. Since 2015 when the government axed the green deal, its flagship energy efficiency policy, there have been no incentives for the so-called able-to-pay market despite the UK having some of the least efficient homes in Europe. During the general election campaign, the energy industry called for the next government to make energy efficiency a national priority to curb household bills and hit carbon targets.",

    "webTitle": "Rail firms to be judged by 'to the minute' train punctuality", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rail companies are to start accounting for the punctuality of trains to the exact minute, as the industry commits to becoming more transparent about delays. Train operators have been criticised by passenger and consumer groups for not always counting the true level of delays, with official measures allowing a five- to 10-minute cushion for lateness. The new benchmark will also report how many trains arrive to the exact minute on every stop along their route, rather than just the final destination. Britain\u2019s rail industry claimed it would give passengers the most transparent measure for train punctuality of any railway in Europe \u2013 and compare favourably with the aviation industry, where a 15-minute delay is counted as arriving on time. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operating companies and Network Rail, said: \u201cBy adopting the most transparent measure in Europe, we want passengers to know that rail companies are putting an even greater focus on ensuring that trains are meeting the timetable, arriving to the minute and at stations along a journey. We are pushing ourselves to drive better punctuality because it will help to deliver a more reliable railway for the whole of Britain.\u201d However, the existing measure of lateness is likely to persist for some time \u2013 partly because, the industry body said, the rail network is only sufficiently connected by existing technology to allow 80% of arrivals at stations to be monitored exactly. The official \u201cpublic performance measure\u201d, where commuter services have five minutes\u2019 leeway and long-distance trains can arrive 10 minutes late and still count as on time, is also the basis on which Network Rail and train operators are monitored and face potential penalties. That standard is now likely to change from April 2019, when Network Rail\u2019s contracts and funding are renewed, and in operators\u2019 franchises starting from that date. Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdog Transport Focus, welcomed the move. He said: \u201cPassengers want a reliable, on-time train service. How that performance is measured and reported should, our research shows, closely mirror passengers\u2019 real-life experience, otherwise trust will not be built up. So it is good to see the rail industry reporting on-time performance at many more stations.\u201d Some rail companies, particularly long-distance ones such as Virgin, have resisted moves to classifying trains as late after the exact time, arguing that removing the flexibility could encourage operators to cancel services or skip stations rather than risk them running late. Automatic compensation for delays is increasingly being paid on some routes, although the new reporting time will not change when it is triggered, usually after 15 or 30 minutes. The Rail Delivery Group said that in the most recent four-week period it had measured, up until 24 June, 65% of trains arrived exactly on time, and 92% of trains arrived within 5 minutes. It said it would publish figures showing average delays and cancellations on a national level, with individual train operators expected to follow suit by next April.

      "body": "<p>Rail companies are to start accounting for the punctuality of trains to the exact minute, as the industry commits to becoming more transparent about delays. </p> <p>Train operators have been criticised by passenger and consumer groups for not always counting the true level of delays, with official measures allowing a five- to 10-minute cushion for lateness. </p> <p>The new benchmark will also report how many trains arrive to the exact minute on every stop along their route, rather than just the final destination. </p> <p>Britain\u2019s rail industry claimed it would give passengers the most transparent measure for train punctuality of any railway in Europe \u2013 and compare favourably with the aviation industry, where a 15-minute delay is counted as arriving on time. </p> <p>Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operating companies and Network Rail, said: \u201cBy adopting the most transparent measure in Europe, we want passengers to know that rail companies are putting an even greater focus on ensuring that trains are meeting the timetable, arriving to the minute and at stations along a journey. We are pushing ourselves to drive better punctuality because it will help to deliver a more reliable railway for the whole of Britain.\u201d</p> <p>However, the existing measure of lateness is likely to persist for some time \u2013 partly because, the industry body said, the rail network is only sufficiently connected by existing technology to allow 80% of arrivals at stations to be monitored exactly. </p> <p>The official \u201cpublic performance measure\u201d, where commuter services have five minutes\u2019 leeway and long-distance trains can arrive 10 minutes late and still count as on time, is also the basis on which Network Rail and train operators are monitored and face potential penalties. That standard is now likely to change from April 2019, when Network Rail\u2019s contracts and funding are renewed, and in operators\u2019 franchises starting from that date. </p> <p>Anthony Smith, chief executive of the independent watchdog Transport Focus, welcomed the move. He said: \u201cPassengers want a reliable, on-time train service. How that performance is measured and reported should, our research shows, closely mirror passengers\u2019 real-life experience, otherwise trust will not be built up. So it is good to see the rail industry reporting on-time performance at many more stations.\u201d</p> <p>Some rail companies, particularly long-distance ones such as Virgin, have resisted moves to classifying trains as late after the exact time, arguing that removing the flexibility could encourage operators to cancel services or skip stations rather than risk them running late. Automatic compensation for delays is increasingly being paid on some routes, although the new reporting time will not change when it is triggered, usually after 15 or 30 minutes. </p> <p>The Rail Delivery Group said that in the most recent four-week period it had measured, up until 24 June, 65% of trains arrived exactly on time, and 92% of trains arrived within 5 minutes. It said it would publish figures showing average delays and cancellations on a national level, with individual train operators expected to follow suit by next April. </p> <p>Passengers can track the punctuality record of specific trains at <a href=\"http://www.mytrainjourney.co.uk/\">www.mytrainjourney.co.uk</a></p>",

PwC said action by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in his autumn budget would help offset weaker household spending and delayed investment by firms anxious about Brexit. But it said the economy\u2019s growth rate was still expected to dip from 1.8% in 2016 to 1.5% this year and to 1.4% in 2018. John Hawksworth, the chief economist at PwC, said: \u201cBrexit-related uncertainty may hold back business investment, but this should be partly offset by planned rises in public investment. Fiscal policy could also be further relaxed in the 2017 autumn budget to offset the ongoing real squeeze on household spending power. \u201cThere are still downside risks relating to Brexit, but there are also upside possibilities if negotiations go smoothly and the recent eurozone economic recovery continues. We expect the UK to suffer a moderate slowdown, not a recession, but businesses should be monitoring this and making contingency plans.\u201d Like most forecasters, PwC was surprised by the resilience of the economy in the six months after the EU referendum in June 2016. Growth rates of 0.6% in the third quarter of 2016 and 0.7% in the fourth quarter meant expansion was stronger in the second half of the year than in the first half. But the consultancy firm said the economy had slowed markedly in the first half of 2017 and pointed to a sharp reduction in housing transactions as evidence of the blow to purchasing power caused by the decline in the value of the pound since the referendum. PwC said it expected house price inflation to fall from 7% in 2016 to 3.7% this year, with the previous property hot spot, London, receiving most of the backwash from the Brexit result. The London property market had been hit most by economic and policy uncertainty and the recent changes to stamp duty, the consultancy said. House price inflation in the capital in the first four months of 2017 was about 4% compared with about 13% in the same period last year. PwC said the city\u2019s housing market would continue to slow, with house prices likely to rise on average by 2.8% this year and by 3.8% in 2018.",

      "bodyText": "One of the more quirky aspects of economic debate in this country is how much attention is focused on interest rates given around two-thirds of the population don\u2019t pay mortgages. The finding from last year\u2019s census show that just 34.5% of homes are owned with a mortgage. But what is concerning is that that level is falling: Australians are now less likely to own a home than ever before. Owning a home is seen as the Australian dream, and a majority of households have either achieved that dream or are on the way. In the greater capital city areas, 36% of households have a mortgage attached, compared with just 31.5% in the non-capital city areas of the nation: But the latest census data confirms the worrying trend of this century of home ownership becoming less common. In 2006, 34.0% of households owned their home outright. By 2011, that had fallen to 32.1% and in the latest census it was now down to just 31.0%: Even including those with a mortgage, the numbers are declining. In 2006, 68.1% of households either owned their property outright or had a mortgage. That fell to 67.0% in 2011 and is now down to 65.5%. The issue isn\u2019t only that people are not paying off their mortgage, but that even the percentage of households with mortgages has fallen. From 2006 to 2011, the percentage of households that were owner-mortgage actually grew from 31.5% to 34.9%. But by 2016 it had fallen back to 34.5%: The biggest fall occurred in NSW, which saw the percentage of households holding a mortgage fall from 33.4% to 32.3%. That is hardly surprising given the increase in housing investment in that period. The massive boom in prices has seen median house prices in Sydney increase by around 60% in the five years from 2011 to 2016 and the cost of mortgage repayments on such loans increase by 30% despite falling interest rates. This drop in housing ownership is not just reflective of the growing unaffordability, but has longer-term implications. As Tim Colebatch has noted, the census found that the falls in ownership are most pronounced among the younger cohorts \u2013 confirming a study by the Grattan Institute in 2014, which concluded that older Australians were the ones who benefitted the most from the mining boom years. Where the declining ownership chickens come home to roost however is in retirement. Australia\u2019s pension and superannuation system is essentially based around the premise of people owning the family home. The more retirees who rent, the greater the level of government outlays to assist with paying those rents. Given it would be political death to include the family home in the assets test for the pension, this could lead to a double whammy in aged care/welfare spending of not just an ageing population but an ageing population that rents. The exclusion of the family home from the assets test, and the continual use of stamp duty as a state revenue measure, also leads to undersupply of housing as recently noted by Hal Pawson, the associate director of the City Futures Research Centre at the University of New South Wales. While Pawson also noted the problem of growing numbers of vacant housing, the current tax and welfare system discourages retirees from selling their family home, even if it is too large for their needs. Thus the size of houses has grown, but the number of people living in them has not: And the data shows that houses owned outright are the type more likely to have a surplus of bedrooms: This is all a heady mix for the Reserve Bank as it attempts to fine-tune the economy though interest rate movements. It would love to be able to keep interest rates stable (raising them before wages start rising would bring with it a very big credit crunch) and it does not want to lower them because it would hate to set off another housing boom, especially in Sydney. And yet in recent months, Australia exchange rate has jumped noticeably \u2013 seemingly on a trajectory to US$0.80: Now in the context of the past few years, that is not all that high, but it is higher than the RBA would like given it has repeatedly noted in its statements on monetary policy decisions of the benefit of the falling exchange rate since 2013 and that \u201can appreciating exchange rate would complicate this adjustment\u201d: A higher dollar makes our exports more expensive and thus hurts such businesses. The problem for the ABS is our currency is improving not really because of our economy, but the US\u2019s. Expectations for more interest rate rises in the US have been dealt a blow because (and stop me if you\u2019ve heard this before) while they have had solid employment growth they have also had very weak wages growth. That change in expectations has weakened the value of the US dollar and in turn increased our dollar\u2019s strength, especially as China\u2019s economy is performing better than expected. For the moment, the wacky prediction game that is the money market has the RBA increasing rates by the end of next year \u2013 a big change on just a couple months ago when the market was predicting a steady cash rate for as far as the eye could see: But if the dollar keeps rising, the pressure will be on the RBA to cut rates in order to lower the dollar\u2019s value. And that could set off another stampede of house prices. The census data shows us that one of the consequences of the RBA cutting rates since 2011 to encourage economic growth has been to reduce the level of home ownership. That doesn\u2019t mean raising rates is the answer, but it does add to the difficulty for the RBA in dealing with the housing market, especially if our dollar keeps rising.",

The more retirees who rent, the greater the level of government outlays to assist with paying those rents.</p> <p>Given it would be political death to include the family home in the assets test for the pension, this could lead to a double whammy in aged care/welfare spending of not just an ageing population but an ageing population that rents.</p> <p>The exclusion of the family home from the assets test, and the continual use of stamp duty as a state revenue measure, also leads to undersupply of housing as recently noted<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/taxing-empty-homes-a-step-towards-affordable-housing-but-much-more-can-be-done-80742\"> by Hal Pawson</a>, the associate director of the City Futures Research Centre at the University of New South Wales.</p> <p>While Pawson also noted the problem of growing numbers of vacant housing, the current tax and welfare system discourages retirees from selling their family home, even if it is too large for their needs.</p> <p>Thus the size of houses has grown, but the number of people living in them has not:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average number of persons and bedrooms per households\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/38O6G/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And the data shows that houses owned outright are the type more likely to have a surplus of bedrooms:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Households by the need for and spare of bedrooms\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1fru3/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>This is all a heady mix for the Reserve Bank as it attempts to fine-tune the economy though interest rate movements.</p> <p>It would love to be able to keep interest rates stable (raising them before wages start rising would bring with it a very big credit crunch) and it does not want to lower them because it would hate to set off another housing boom, especially in Sydney.</p> <p>And yet in recent months, Australia exchange rate has jumped noticeably \u2013 seemingly on a trajectory to US$0.80:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Australia's exchange rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LgpWc/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Now in the context of the past few years, that is not all that high, but it is higher than the RBA would like given it has repeatedly noted in its <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2017/mr-17-13.html\">statements on monetary policy decisions</a> of the benefit of the falling exchange rate since 2013 and that \u201can appreciating exchange rate would complicate this adjustment\u201d:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Australia's exchange rate, 2010-2017\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/No8F2/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>A higher dollar makes our exports more expensive and thus hurts such businesses. The problem for the ABS is our currency is improving not really because of our economy, but the US\u2019s. Expectations for more interest rate rises in the US have been dealt a blow because (and stop me if you\u2019ve heard this before) while they have had solid employment growth they have also had very weak wages growth.</p> <p>That change in expectations has weakened the value of the US dollar and in turn increased our dollar\u2019s strength, especially as <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-17/china-gdp-economic-data/8715426?section=business\">China\u2019s economy</a> is performing better than expected.</p> <p>For the moment, the wacky prediction game that is the money market has the RBA increasing rates by the end of next year \u2013 a big change on just a couple months ago when the market was predicting a steady cash rate for as far as the eye could see:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Market expectations of the RBA cash rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EcqiY/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But if the dollar keeps rising, the pressure will be on the RBA to cut rates in order to lower the dollar\u2019s value. And that could set off another stampede of house prices.</p> <p>The census data shows us that one of the consequences of the RBA cutting rates since 2011 to encourage economic growth has been to reduce the level of home ownership. That doesn\u2019t mean raising rates is the answer, but it does add to the difficulty for the RBA in dealing with the housing market, especially if our dollar keeps rising. </p>",
