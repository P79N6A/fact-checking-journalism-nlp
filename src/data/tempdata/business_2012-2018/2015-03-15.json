Airlines are reaping the benefits of a sharp drop in jet-fuel prices because of the tumble in crude-oil values, but industry experts said carriers are likely put the cost savings to work elsewhere. \u201cIn the short-term, the answer is: there really is no benefit for the consumer,\u201d said Jeff Klee, chief executive officer of CheapAir.com, an online travel agency. \u201cThe reality is airlines don\u2019t price their flights based on their cost.

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s in, what\u2019s out? It\u2019s time for the annual reshuffle of the shopping basket used to measure inflation in the UK, almost 70 years since it was first compiled. The updated contents of the virtual shopping basket will be revealed by the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday. Looking back over the past eight decades, they paint a fascinating picture of changing lifestyles in Britain. In the late 1940s, men\u2019s and women\u2019s hats, gramophone records, cod liver oil, iron bedsteads and gas fires featured in the basket. By 2014, it included video streaming services such as Netflix, condoms, baby wipes and flavoured milk bought on the go. In 1947, the Ministry of Labour and National Service began recording the prices of a \u201ctypical\u201d shopping basket to help calculate inflation. As the prices of the various items in the basket change over time, so does the total cost of the basket. Each year, the basket is updated and new products and services are added while others are removed. Responsibility for the inflation figures later moved to what is now known as the Office for National Statistics. The march of technology saw ebooks included for the first time in 2013 along with digital television receivers. Last year, DVD recorders were dropped (seen as old technology) \u2013 along with hardwood flooring (a victim of austerity). As well as updating the contents of the basket, the ONS also reviews the weighting attached to each item that makes up the consumer price index (CPI), to better reflect the changing nature of the cost of living. Last year, it noted that household fuels now account for a much larger proportion of people\u2019s living costs than a decade ago. Over the last 25 years households started spending far more on services like hairdressers than in the early days of the basket. The basket has got ever larger over the years and now includes restaurant meals, package holidays and insurance policies. Some food staples \u2013 like bread, milk and tea \u2013 have stayed while others drift in and out. Canned corned beef was in the first basket and was only removed in 2005 (charcuterie was added two years ago). In 1947, the food section contained 65 items. It soon expanded to include various cuts of fresh meat in 1956 such sirloin, silverside, brisket and popeseye steak, as the postwar economy recovered. By 2014, the food list had swelled to more than 150 items, including kiwis, avocados, pre-packed salad, energy and mixer drinks, fruit smoothies and fish fingers. The large variety of fresh beef cuts has made way for frozen beefburgers and chicken nuggets. Five years ago, garlic bread ousted pitta bread, and three years ago, rum replaced champagne. Some foods have made a comeback. Frozen prawns dropped out in 1992, only to return 10 years later, while honey left in 1991 and made a comeback last year. Sparkling wine was removed in 2006 and returned in 2011 to reflect the growth of non-champagne sales. Falling food prices and the global oil slump \u2013 which is feeding through to petrol and other fuel prices \u2013 have been pushing inflation lower and it hit 0.3% in January, the lowest level since consumer price records began in 1989. Inflation is even expected to turn negative this spring before picking up again. The key measure in 1947 and for decades to come was the retail prices index (RPI). It has been replaced by the CPI, which is now used by the Bank of England for inflation targeting. The main difference between the two measures is that RPI includes housing costs whereas CPI does not. Pensions and most benefits are now linked to CPI, but some costs such as rail fares are still linked to RPI.",

      "bodyText": "For adherents to the cult of superstar chief executive, it has been an encouraging fortnight. The market appears to believe the theory that one individual\u2019s assumed brilliance can change the fortunes of an organisation employing tens of thousands of people. Standard Chartered\u2019s appointment of Bill Winters, one-time deputy head at JP Morgan, immediately added 5% to the value of the Asia-focused bank. More spectacularly, Credit Suisse rose 8% as it hired Tidjane Thiam from the Prudential. On the face of it, the knee-jerk enthusiasm looks like a case of wishful thinking. Remember one of Warren Buffett\u2019s pieces of wisdom from the 1980s: \u201cWhen a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.\u201d Most of the time, Buffett has been right. In the UK, the number of chief executives who have been highly successful at one company and then repeated their achievements at a higher-profile business is very limited. In the UK, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio is probably in that class. He was the well-regarded boss of Santander UK before and during the banking crisis, and has now led the recovery at Lloyds Banking Group. But in another specialised field \u2013 retailing \u2013 Marc Bolland has not been able to improve Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s share price in the style he did at Morrisons. But in Thiam\u2019s case, there are at least five reasons why his chances of success are better than Buffett\u2019s remarks would suggest. First, he\u2019s clearly an exceptional individual \u2013 you do not emerge from Ivory Coast to rise to the top of the UK\u2019s 11th-largest company unless you\u2019re good. Thiam was the first black chief executive of a FTSE 100 company and got the job in 2009 at the relatively young age of 47. And he has not achieved success via sharp elbows: he is unfailingly polite. Second, he\u2019s good at choosing who he works for. He left Aviva in 2007 to join arch-rival the Pru as finance director, probably spotting that the fortunes of the two companies, seen as peers at the time, were about to diverge. \u201cI voted with my feet in joining the group,\u201d he said afterwards. Going to Credit Suisse does not signal lack of confidence in the Pru, but maybe he judges that bulge-bracket banks are overdue a recovery. Third, it\u2019s relatively easy \u2013 with hindsight \u2013 to explain the success of the Pru under Thiam. The business had improved under predecessor Mark Tucker, but the acceleration since 2009, which has seen a tripling of the share price, has been built on a clear-headed and rigorous allocation of capital. It\u2019s not rocket science. Heavy investment in Asia has been justified by the sums of cash that have flowed to the centre. A dose of similar financial discipline might do wonders for Credit Suisse: it is probably best at wealth management, not investment banking, and maybe a reordering of priorities will provide the necessary jolt. Fourth, Thiam\u2019s big adventure at the Pru \u2013 the abandoned $35bn bid for AIA \u2013 doesn\u2019t look so silly with the passage of time. The bid was killed by Pru\u2019s own sceptical shareholders and Thiam\u2019s job was briefly on the line. But AIA\u2019s value has doubled subsequently. The execution challenges would still have been stiff, but the price was right. Fifth, Thiam is probably not the banking novice of caricature. As he pointed out last week, he worked on restructuring jobs for investment banks when a consultant at McKinsey. He has traded interest rate swaps and built option-pricing models. And the Pru has an $800bn balance sheet, which requires its boss to know how to hedge risk. He is unlikely to be baffled by banking details. There are, of course, no guarantees whatsoever that Thiam will succeed at Credit Suisse, and it\u2019s usually ridiculous in any case to ascribe corporate success to one individual. But, from Zurich\u2019s point of view, the appointment is entirely logical. Berlin bemused by Greek tour As an exercise in shuttle diplomacy, it has manifestly failed. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek leader, tours European capitals, speaking pleasantries, while his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, throws stones. Henry Kissinger it is not. Last week, Tsipras was in Paris and Brussels attempting to charm OECD boss Angel Gurr\u00eda and European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. Meanwhile, Varoufakis traded barbs with German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, taking offence at the German\u2019s quips. Varoufakis seems to exemplify the Syriza-led government\u2019s fixation with being right \u2013 and belief that being right is all that matters. As an economist who has taught in the UK, the US and Australia, he knows a thing or two about recessions. He knows austerity doesn\u2019t work. He might have simply explained that crushing an economy with cuts only increases the debt-to-GDP ratio, and pointed out that France has failed to stay within its borrowing limits for most of the past 15 years, which surely allows Athens a little leeway. But he is a showman and wanted to convince all Europe that the Greeks have suffered a special torture, using terms like waterboarding and asphyxiation. Now the high ground is shifting to Brussels. Officials in the EC are demanding concrete reform proposals. If not the original agenda backed by Germany, then a more social democratic version. Nothing has surfaced so far. And the people of Greece detect that their new leaders are flapping. An editorial in a Greek newspaper chided the Syriza leaders for \u201crushing forward in every direction at the same time\u201d which it said \u201cbetrays weakness and desperation \u2013 as if they chose an impossible task as an excuse for failing where they could succeed\u201d. Support at home could quickly crumble, as Berlin is well aware. It\u2019s worth remembering Tsipras and his radical left party were elected with 36% of the popular vote and is in power thanks to a rule that hands the winning party an extra 100 seats. Energy prices deserve to be cut down to size The energy companies should not be surprised that the Labour party has seized the initiative and pledged to force price cuts before the end of the year. The move by Ed Miliband looks nakedly political in the runup to the election: but there is also an economic logic to it, given that the wholesale cost of power has slumped and the benefits have still not been passed on to consumers. The big six suppliers, which still have a 90% stranglehold on the retail market and an even bigger share of power generation, have in part blamed Labour\u2019s earlier commitment to a price freeze for not passing on their savings. That excuse is not good enough and \u2013 given that the Competition and Markets Authority will not rule finally until December on whether there has been profiteering \u2013 some kind of action is needed in the meantime. With a legacy of mis-selling, poor service and high charges, this industry has few friends. It may not be long before we see full price controls on the table.",

      "bodyText": "Although it is often impossible to remember where you\u2019ve left them, it\u2019s increasingly common for people to have multiple pairs of glasses dotted around the house for various purposes. With a pair for reading, another for using a computer and another to watch the television or drive the car, finding the right ones can be a frustration. But turning the house upside down in the search for the right pair of specs could be a thing of the past thanks to Adlens. The Oxford-based company specialises in \u201cadjustable focus eyewear\u201d \u2013 glasses that can change their strength at the turn of a dial, depending on what activity you\u2019re using them for. Around 600,000 pairs have been bought around the world in almost four years \u2013 including in the developing world, with the eyewear sold for \u00a31 a pair to Rwandans in need of corrected vision via a connected charity. The \u201cAdlens Adjustables\u201d are based on technology from the 1960s developed by the Nobel prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez. The distinctive lens system on the glasses is made up of two polycarbonate plates on each eye which slide across each other by twisting the dials at each side. Where the plates sit determines the strength of the lenses. When they were initially developed in the 1960s, each lens cost $1,000, according to Dr Graeme MacKenzie, director of industry and regulatory affairs at Adlens. Using injection moulding techniques, the company has brought down the price substantially with the flexible glasses now being sold for under \u00a330. James Chen, a member of a wealthy Hong Kong Chinese family, who co-founded the company in 2005, says: \u201cWith this you can have [glasses for the] computer, reading, reading in bed [and] different lighting. Adjustability proved a huge factor.\u201d Where the glasses differ from cheap pairs sold by high street chemists is their flexibility to be changed to whatever the user needs at the time, he said. Adlens has marketed the glasses as a temporary measure for when prescription glasses are lost or broken and for those with diabetes who see changes in their vision as blood levels fluctuate. Any fears that the self-diagnosis may damage the eye are unfounded, says MacKenzie. \u201cThe visual system is really good at detecting discomfort and if, particularly on this product, if you turn it in and you get it wrong, you will feel it. If you go too far, you will feel your eye straining and you can very easily turn in the other direction. \u201cWhat this product does is it takes that exact procedure [with an optician] but it cuts out the external person. You can make a judgment on your own.\u201d Japan has proved a fruitful market, selling 100,000 of the 600,000 sold so far, with the US, Mexico and Norway emerging as other key sales areas. Not so the UK, however. Only 1,000 pairs have been sold because they can only be bought through optometrists. Regulations dictate that glasses can only be sold via a prescription from an optometrist unless they are reading glasses, which can be bought off the shelf in retailers such as Boots. \u201cIn the UK, the current regulation restricts the sale of our glasses in a way that you don\u2019t have in Japan or in other countries,\u201d says MacKenzie. Running parallel to the commercial operation is the charity Vision for a Nation, which supplies the glasses free of charge to Rwanda\u2019s health authorities and funds a training programme for nurses to conduct eye tests. It is estimated that up to 1 million of the country\u2019s 11 million people need glasses, says Chen. Most of those with sight difficulties will need standard reading glasses while between 5% and 10% will be able to get the Vision for a Nation adjustable lenses. Chen, who says that vision issues have a low priority in the developing world, hopes to expand the project to Bhutan in the future. \u201cI would not have even started this project if all I was thinking about was making money from this,\u201d he says. \u201cIf all I did was make a lot of money, sold a lot of these things in the developed world who already have access to glasses, I would feel I had not succeeded. The benchmark to success is that we are able to bring access to vision and to bring glasses to people who otherwise would not have been served and I think that is something that informs everything that we do.\u201d By charging \u00a31 a pair, the glasses are given a value to the person buying them as opposed to being given away for free, says Chen. That money is then put into a fund to deal with other eye-related problems such as cataracts. Chen\u2019s investment in the project \u2013 he is co-founder, owner and board member at Adlens and a trustee of the charity \u2013 has been put in the millions. The next product to come to market from the company is a much more elaborate version of the adjustable glasses. Pairs of chunky and fashionable glasses \u2013 which appear identical to conventional eyewear \u2013 have a discreet dial on each of the arms which can switch between three different pre-set strengths. The new range uses a different type of technology to their stablemates in that fluid is injected into the lens to change the curvature. Instead of having to test and adjust to the strength, the presets switch the power of the glasses through the three different prescriptions depending on what the wearer is doing. Dr Rob Stevens, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, says Adlens are aiming for people over 45 who are unhappy with their varifocal lenses, which have invisible lines between the reading and distance part of the lens. Testing the US The new range of Adlens glasses have a discreet switch in the arms to vary between three different preset strengths. They cost $800 and are in the early stages of sales in the US. The company claims that capturing 3% of the existing market for varifocals in America would be worth around $180m. If successful, they could go on sale in the UK next year.",

The benchmark to success is that we are able to bring access to vision and to bring glasses to people who otherwise would not have been served and I think that is something that informs everything that we do.\u201d<br></p> <p>By charging \u00a31 a pair, the glasses are given a value to the person buying them as opposed to being given away for free, says Chen. That money is then put into a fund to deal with other eye-related problems such as cataracts.</p> <p>Chen\u2019s investment in the project \u2013 he is co-founder, owner and board member at Adlens and a trustee of the charity \u2013 has been put in the millions. </p> <p>The next product to come to market from the company is a much more elaborate version of the adjustable glasses. Pairs of chunky and fashionable glasses \u2013 which appear identical to conventional eyewear \u2013 have a discreet dial on each of the arms which can switch between three different pre-set strengths.</p> <p>The new range uses a different type of technology to their stablemates in that fluid is injected into the lens to change the curvature. Instead of having to test and adjust to the strength, the presets switch the power of the glasses through the three different prescriptions depending on what the wearer is doing. </p> <p>Dr Rob Stevens, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, says Adlens are aiming for people over 45 who are unhappy with their varifocal lenses, which have invisible lines between the reading and distance part of the lens.<br></p> <h2>Testing the US</h2> <p>The new range of Adlens glasses have a discreet switch in the arms to vary between three different preset strengths. They cost $800 and are in the early stages of sales in the US.<br></p> <p> The company claims that capturing 3% of the existing market for varifocals in America would be worth around $180m. If successful, they could go on sale in the UK next year.</p>",
