Analysis of the wealth of America\u2019s richest people found that Gates, Bezos and Buffett were sitting on a combined $248.5bn (\u00a3190bn) fortune. The Institute for Policy Studies said the growing gap between rich and poor had created a \u201cmoral crisis\u201d. In a report, the Billionaire Bonanza, the thinktank said Donald Trump\u2019s tax change proposals would \u201cexacerbate existing wealth disparities\u201d as 80% of tax benefits would end up going to the wealthiest 1% of households. \u201cWealth inequality is on the rise,\u201d said Chuck Collins, an economist and co-author of the report. \u201cNow is the time for actions that reduce inequality, not tax cuts for the very wealthy.\u201d The study found that the billionaires included in Forbes magazine\u2019s list of the 400 richest people in the US were worth a combined $2.68tn \u2013 more than the gross domestic product (GDP) of the UK. \u201cOur wealthiest 400 now have more wealth combined than the bottom 64% of the US population, an estimated 80m households or 204 million people,\u201d the report says. \u201cThat\u2019s more people than the population of Canada and Mexico combined.\u201d The report says the \u201cbillionaire class\u201d continues to \u201cpull apart from the rest of us\u201d at the fastest rate ever recorded. \u201cWe have not witnessed such extreme levels of concentrated wealth and power since the first gilded age a century ago.\u201d Forbes celebrated 2017 as \u201canother record year for the wealthiest people in America\u201d, as \u201cthe price of admission to the country\u2019s most exclusive club jumped nearly 18% to $2bn\u201d. That was a tenfold increase on the amount of money needed to enter the list when it first started in 1982. Josh Hoxie, another co-author of the thinktank report, said: \u201cSo much money concentrating in so few hands while so many people struggle is not just bad economics, it\u2019s a moral crisis.\u201d The report says many Americans are joining an \u201cemerging anti-inequality movement\u201d. \u201cA century ago, a similar anti-inequality upsurge took on America\u2019s vastly unequal distribution of income and wealth and, over the course of little more than a generation, fashioned a much more equal America,\u201d it says. The rise at the wealthiest end of society comes as one in five US households live in what the report\u2019s authors call the \u201cunderwater nation\u201d, with either zero or negative wealth. Inequality is even more stark among minorities. Three in 10 black households and 27% of Latino ones have zero or negative wealth, compared with 14% of white families. Just two African Americans made the Forbes 400: Oprah Winfrey (number 264 with $3bn) and the tech investor Robert Smith (226 with $3.3bn). Five members of the Forbes 400 have Latino backgrounds, including the property magnate Jorge P\u00e9rez, the LA Angels baseball team owner Arturo Moreno and three members of the family of late Colombian beer magnate Julio Mario Santo Domingo, a major shareholder of SABMiller. The top 25 people in the survey are all white. The richest is Gates, the Microsoft founder, with $89bn, followed by Amazon\u2019s Bezos with $81.5bn, then investor Warren Buffett with $78bn and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg with $71bn. Since the Forbes 400 was published last month, Amazon\u2019s share price has increased by more than 10%, lifting Bezos\u2019s fortune to an estimated $95bn, putting him in the provisional number one spot. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Paddington Bear, the star of Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s Christmas ad, always kept a marmalade sandwich in his hat in case of emergency. M&amp;S itself just reaches for another restructuring. The latest rejig is not the full sandwich, it should be said. Chief executive Steve Rowe is merely accelerating the store closure programme and making the expansion of Simply Food simply slower. Both measures look sensible. Taking five years to close 10% of the floor space devoted to clothing and homeware always felt too leisurely. As for food, finding new trading tricks \u2013 as opposed to opening lots more stores \u2013 is clearly the priority. Like-for-like sales are going sideways at a time when food inflation is 3%. M&amp;S has been caught on the hop in food. Competitors have saturated the country with convenience stores and online competition is biting. Yet nobody is pretending that the latest strategic shuffle is the final stage in delivering the \u201cfaster, more commercial M&amp;S\u201d that Rowe wants. \u201cThe business still has many structural issues to tackle as we embark on the next five years of our transformation,\u201d he declared. He\u2019s been saying as much since he got the job 18 months ago, but some of the details should shock shareholders. His predecessor, Marc Bolland, spent a fortune on logistics and digitalisation but, it turns out, yet more investment is required in technology. That expensive tale seems never-ending. So do the \u201cadjustments\u201d \u2013 always downwards, naturally \u2013 to profits. The adjustments in the latest half-year totalled \u00a3101m but arrive after a colossal \u00a3437m in the last financial year and \u00a3201m in the year before that. If five more years of toil lie ahead, there may be more to come. On the plus side, Rowe can claim early success in his big push to get M&amp;S off the promotional treadmill in clothing. Full-price sales were up 5.3% in the half-year, which is a significant number. But \u201cstronger headwinds\u201d \u2013 his description of trading conditions in food \u2013 is a phrase chief executives use when they\u2019re not expecting the breezes to change direction soon. That is a new factor that makes the reinvention of M&amp;S even harder. \u201cThings are always happening to me,\u201d complained Paddington. M&amp;S shareholders know the feeling. GSK\u2019s priorities right with top scientific appointment Emma Walmsley, after six months as chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, hasn\u2019t yet worked any magic on the share price but she clearly knows how to make high-profile hires. Her first coup was to poach Luke Miels from arch-rival AstraZeneca as head of pharmaceuticals. AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot was reported to be livid. The latest arrival, as GSK\u2019s chief scientific officer, is Hal Barron, who is a big name in the pharma world. He comes directly from Calico, a Google-funded Californian biotech outfit, but was previously chief medical officer at Roche, responsible for developing drugs for both the parent and its high-flying Genentech subsidiary. There were a few big blockbuster drugs out of Roche in that period. GSK is in need of similar medicine. Barron doesn\u2019t come cheap. He\u2019ll be paid slightly more than Walmsley, reflecting both the cost of US pharma executives and the fact that, at a big pharma company, the top scientist is arguably more important than the chief executive. If he hits his incentive targets, Barron will be on about $13.5m (\u00a310.3m) a year. GSK\u2019s shares have fallen 10% since Walmsley talked vaguely at last month\u2019s third quarter update about bidding for Pfizer\u2019s consumer products division. It remains hard to see how GSK could afford the Pfizer unit, which might cost $15bn, while still maintaining its much-prized dividend. But the hiring of Barron addresses the parallel worry that she\u2019s gone wobbly on pharmaceuticals. The appointment underscores \u201cthe absolute unequivocal prioritisation\u201d of pharmaceuticals, said Walmsley. She\u2019s labouring the point, but it\u2019s the right point: GSK needs a fatter pipeline of new drugs. About time boardroom diversity shifts to executive appointments \u201cToo much of the focus has been on the non-executives of listed firms, not the day-to-day leaders of our biggest businesses,\u201d says Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, pointing out the obvious flaw in the multiyear drive to get more women into the boardrooms of our biggest public companies. Mildly encouraging headline figures \u2013 27.7% of board positions in FTSE 100 companies are occupied by women, up from 11% in 2007 \u2013 mask the real story. There have been lots of women appointed to non-executive posts, but too few to executive jobs. Currently only six chief executives at FTSE 100 firms are women, and there are only 10 women in the top executive posts at FTSE 250 companies, reports Cranfield School of Management. For women in all executive directorship roles, the ratios are only slightly higher: about 10% in the FTSE 100 and just 7.7% in the FTSE 250. For all the prodding by government-backed reviews, those figures are terrible. Attention is now shifting to executive appointments \u2013 about time too. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Struggling care home provider Four Seasons, which is responsible for 17,000 elderly and vulnerable people, is set to be taken over by a US hedge fund in a complex rescue deal being closely monitored by regulators. Four Seasons has buckled under the pressure of state funding cuts, a shortage of EU nurses since the Brexit vote, higher costs after the introduction of the national living wage and meeting repayments on a debt pile of \u00a3525m. The UK\u2019s second-largest care home provider, owned by multi-millionaire Guy Hands\u2019 private equity group Terra Firma, put forward its own survival plan last month ahead of a \u00a326m debt repayment due in December that it would have been unable to honour. But H/2 Capital, a privately-owned hedge fund and property investor based in Stamford, Connecticut that has gradually bought up the majority of Four Seasons\u2019 debt, countered with an alternative proposal that will see it take over ownership. The proposals will leave Terra Firma sitting on a huge loss from an investment that this week\u2019s Paradise Papers leaks reveal was designed to generate a near-\u00a3900m windfall via a complex system of loans facilitating legal tax avoidance. Under H/2\u2019s rescue plan, which has been welcomed by Terra Firma, the US firm will inject \u00a3135m of equity into the business, cancel \u00a3247m of debt and defer interest payments until March 2018. Terra Firma will also inject \u00a345m of new equity and will be left with just an 11% stake in the business. H/2 also intends to spend \u00a325m on refurbishing some of Four Seasons\u2019 335 care homes and its 25 hospitals and specialist care centres, and set up a \u00a315m bonus scheme for its 25,000 staff. It is not clear what experience the company has in running care homes. The \u201cStrategy\u201d section of its website focuses on investments in rental housing in the US. But the company\u2019s proposal offers a much-needed exit for Terra Firma from an investment that has been among the most disastrous in a portfolio that also included the collapse of EMI under its debts. It bought Four Seasons for \u00a3825m in 2012 and has failed to turn it around despite \u00a3450m of investment, eventually being forced to write down the value of the business to a nominal sum. Information revealed in the Paradise Papers reveals that Terra Firma hoped to extract \u00a3890m from the company by arranging costly loans from its own subsidiaries. The private equity firm eventually had to write off the debt but interest payments have still proved unaffordable, amid a perfect storm of increased costs and lower funding from government. The Brexit vote has added to Four Seasons\u2019 woes as a 96% reduction in the number of nurses coming to Britain from the EU has forced it to turn to more expensive agency nurses. Responding to H/2\u2019s proposal, Terra Firma said: \u201cWe stand ready to agree the transfer of our interest [...] to the creditors for a nominal sum as part of this restructuring.\u201d Spencer B Haber, H/2 Capital\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said: \u201cWe firmly believe that with the right stewardship, enterprises like Four Seasons best serve their investors when they best serve their residents. Responsible private capital understands the primacy of resident care and peace of mind for their families. He said Four Seasons staff were \u201cmore than capable of setting an example here, right across the social care community. While we share a mission with these talented individuals, it is their role \u2013 and not ours \u2013 that holds the consequence and the challenge. \u201cWe just need to do the easy part, which is to enable them by providing the bedrock of financial stability, aligned incentives, and a fair cost of capital that enables the Group to carry out the solemn responsibility of caring for 17,000 vulnerable people.\u201d The real estate company, which has no significant investments in healthcare or in the UK, is proposing to install Baroness Ford as Four Seasons chairman. The cross-bench peer served as chairman of Grove Limited, the holding company of Barchester Healthcare, between 2012 and 2015. She has also been a director of energy regulator Ofgem, the Scottish prison service and chaired the Olympic Park Legacy Company. The Care Quality Commission, a division of the Department of Health that regulates and inspects health and social care services, said it was monitoring the situation closely. Speaking last month, after Four Season\u2019s original rescue plan was proposed, the CQC said the firm\u2019s effort to refinance itself \u201cwould provoke some anxiety but is an important step in securing the long-term financial future of this company\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "And finally..... Sky News has an interesting tale about Brexit and the banking sector.... Here\u2019s a flavour: The boss of JPMorgan\u200e warned Theresa May and Philip Hammond on Wednesday that the French government is intensifying efforts to lure British banking jobs across the Channel, even as he hailed greater clarity about the UK\u2019s post-Brexit planning. Sky News has learnt that Jamie Dimon, the Wall Street banking giant\u2019s \u200echairman and chief executive, held private talks with the Prime Minister and Chancellor in Downing Street on Wednesday. It was the latest in a series of meetings between one of the global banking sector\u2019s most powerful ex\u200eecutives and British Cabinet ministers amid efforts to persuade the Government to provide firm evidence of how it intends a transition period to work. Sources familiar with the meeting, which was also attended by Daniel Pinto, who runs JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank globally, said the bankers had committed to retaining \u201ca large proportion\u201d of their existing UK operations after Brexit. JPMorgan employs roughly 15,000 people in the UK. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here\u2019s our news story about the pressure building on UK wages as firms struggle to find staff: In the media world, one of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s key allies has sold his stake in the mogul\u2019s 21st Century Fox. The move could strengthen those shareholders who are unhappy about the Murdoch clan\u2019s domination of the group, and agitating for change. My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who controls the investment firm Kingdom Holding and is one of the world\u2019s richest men, at one stage owned more than 6% of Fox and has consistently backed the Murdochs in shareholder votes about the family\u2019s control of the company. He has been a shareholder in Murdoch companies \u2013 including Fox and News Corp, the owner of the Sun, Times and Wall Street Journal \u2013 for two decades and expressed public support for the family after the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World in 2011. Regulatory filings in New York show Prince Alwaleed reduced his stake to 4.98% in December 2015, and an analysis of Bloomberg data shows the stake has fallen to zero since the end of the last financial quarter, on 30 September. It is not clear why he sold the stake or to whom. The sale represents the loss of an ally for the Murdochs and adds an extra twist to reports this week that Fox held talks with Disney about selling most of the company... More here: The UK\u2019s blue-chip index, the FTSE 100, has closed 16 points higher at 7529 Unions have warned they will not accept job cuts if the proposed merger between SSE and NPower goes through. UNISON national energy officer Matt Lay says staff are feeling pretty nervous following the tie-up: \u201cThis bolt from the blue will have left many of the companies\u2019 employees feeling decidedly anxious. \u201cWith the merger only just announced, there\u2019s no detail yet as to the number of jobs that may go, the posts most affected, or the sites at risk. Stock markets are taking a breather today, it seems. Wall Street has opened calmly, with the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all dipping slightly. Snap, the social platform, has slumped by 10% though after posting disappointing results last night. It is now planning to redesign its app, after failing to hit analyst forecasts for user growth or revenues. China\u2019s Tencent, which operates the Wechat messaging platform WeChat, has now built a more than $2bn stake in Snap.... In London, the FTSE 100 is up 11 points, or +0.1%, while the French CAC is down 0.2% and the German DAX is unchanged. The pound has been under pressure today as traders try to keep up with another day of political drama in the UK. International development secretary Priti Patel is flying back to the UK as the row over her \u2018working holiday\u2019 in Israel escalates. Could she be sacked today? Has she already been fired? Political hacks are glued to Flightradar24 for the latest. Foreign secretary Boris Johnson is in familiar hot water too, facing calls to quit after wrongly stating last week that imprisoned UK citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been training journalist in Iran. It all leaves Theresa May\u2019s government looking anything but strong and stable, which isn\u2019t great for sterling. The pound is down 0.5% at $1.3105 vs the dollar, and \u20ac1.1305 against the euro. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, explains: \u201cThe pound slipped against the dollar and the euro today as the next round of Brexit negotiations approach, amid fresh political controversy at Westminster. Progress in negotiations has so far remained incremental, but the markets are hopeful on the back of renewed discussion of a transition period from the government. Following last week\u2019s allegations that resulted in the resignation of the defence secretary, fresh controversy over Secretary of State for International Development Priti Patel\u2019s conduct overseas and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson\u2019s comments have put immense pressure on Downing Street. If the situation worsens today sterling could potentially be pressured lower. Irish house prices inflation has hit a two-year high, driving prices back to their highest level since the financial crisis. House prices across the Republic rose by 12.8% per annum in September, up from 11.8% in August. The Central Statistics Office explains: Dublin house prices increased 12.4%. Apartments in Dublin increased 11.4% in the same period. The highest house price growth was in Dublin City, at 13.9%. In contrast, the lowest growth was in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, with house prices rising 9.9%. This pushes the CSO\u2019s index of Irish house prices up to 99.9, a whisker away from their level in 2005, and the highest level since April 2009. If British firms do cut back on investment, it will make it even harder to hit the UK\u2019s research and development goals. The UK government\u2019s goal is to get R&amp;D spending up to to the OECD target of 2.4% within a decade, and to 3% in the long term. But in 2015, UK R&amp;D spending was \u00a331.6bn, or just 1.7% of GDP - well shy of the target. A report issued yesterday by The Royal Society showed how Britain is lagging behind. The report warned: Increasing overall R&amp;D investment is the target. To deliver this we need to create a vibrant environment that fosters research and innovation throughout UK public services, universities, charities and businesses and attracts global investment, incentivising companies to locate their R&amp;D here. A strategic approach, alongside an Industrial Strategy, will be key to realising our ambition. Only by doing this will we improve the health and wealth of the nation. UK recruitment firms say British employers are having to offer bigger pay rises, to cope with a shortage in workers from the EU. Reuters has the details: The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said its monthly survey showed starting salaries rose in October at the second-quickest rate since November 2015. \u201cWe already know that EU workers are leaving because of the uncertainties they are facing right now,\u201d REC chief executive Kevin Green said. \u201cWe therefore need clarity around what future immigration systems will look like. Otherwise, the situation will get worse and employers will face even more staff shortages.\u201d British workers really do need a pay rise. As these chart shows, real wages have been shrinking since the spring as inflation has rattled up to 3% - mainly due to the slump in the pound after the EU referendum. UK firms seem to be particularly reluctant to commit to new offices and factories. The Bank of England\u2019s agents found that firms expect to invest less in 2019 and 2020, as they await more clarity about Britain\u2019s economic future and how Brexit will play out. The agents\u2019 report says: Firms in the survey expected investment growth to be little changed over the next twelve months, relative to the past twelve months. However, investment growth was expected to be somewhat weaker over the following two years. Expectations for investment growth in the coming twelve months were strongest for business services contacts, and were weakest \u2014 at broadly unchanged levels \u2014 for construction. This chart confirms that firms expect to spend less: This report is based on interviews with 375 businesses, who employ 578,000 people in the UK. Breaking: UK companies are struggling to recruit new staff, and expect to hand over larger pay rises next year. That\u2019s according to the latest survey from the Bank of England\u2019s regional agents, just released. The agents found that : Recruitment difficulties had intensified and were above normal in a range of activities, alongside continued modest employment growth. As a result, pay growth had edged up and was expected to be somewhat higher in 2018 than this year. Firms suggested that pay settlements next year could be clustered around 2\u00bd%\u20133\u00bd% rather than 2%\u20133% during 2017. If they\u2019re right, then Britain\u2019s cost of living squeeze could end next year. The latest figures show that basic pay is only rising by 2.1%, while inflation has hit 3%. The agents also found that firms\u2019 expectations of investment growth in the following two years were weaker than last month. Many blamed economic uncertainty, due to Brexit and concerns about the future availability of overseas labour. The report says: Investment plans were being boosted by companies\u2019 desire to increase their efficiency and to meet expected increases in demand, but expectations about the United Kingdom\u2019s future trading relationships were dragging on spending. The BoE\u2019s agents also reported that growth in activity remains \u201cbroadly stable\u201d, adding: Manufacturing output growth had risen again, with export supply chains supported by the past fall in sterling and some signs of increased domestic sourcing. But construction output growth had eased. Services turnover growth remained moderate. Anne-Sylvaine Chassany, the FT\u2019s Paris bureau chief, reports that Bank of America is pressing on with its plans to move 300 staff from London: Britain\u2019s Big Six could soon be the Big Five. No, not in the football (before any long-suffering Arsenal fans cry foul), but in the energy market. SSE and Npower have now agreed terms to merge their household supply businesses in Britain, creating a new supplier with over 11 million customers, more than anyone else. The deal, which was reported yesterday, is likely to stir worries about competition and could yet be blocked by regulators. SSE is the second largest supplier, while nPower is joint-4th largest. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Market says the deal will face \u201cintense competition scrutiny\u201d.... Especially after the government\u2019s recent pledge to control price increases for the most vulnerable to fix what many regard as a broken market, where prices continue to rise despite a move towards renewables. Big six to big five doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u201cconsumer benefit\u201d. Marks &amp; Spencer also reports that its food sales -- usually so buoyant - dropped by 0.1% in the last six months. Rising food inflation took a bite out of profitability too, leaving M&amp;S hoping that its new Christmas advert starring Paddington Bear is a hit. Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown sees little to celebrate: The food business has been keeping M&amp;S afloat in recent years, but now progress seems to be flagging here, the clothing division needs to start pulling its own weight. The festive period also looks set to be challenging for the high street. Real wages are around 0.5% lower than they were last year, and the recent interest rate rise might well make consumers think twice about loading up on debt to fund the annual Christmas splurge. For M&amp;S it\u2019s still early days in the turnaround plan, and it\u2019s unfortunate that the retailer\u2019s structural issues have been compounded by tough times in the industry as a whole. There won\u2019t be any champagne accompanying the marmalade sandwiches at M&amp;S HQ, it\u2019s a quick brew, then back to work.\u2019 Over in the City, shares in Marks &amp; Spencer have dropped by more than 2% after it announced it is speeding up its turnaround plan. Chief executive Steve Rowe warned that M&amp;S still faces \u201cmany structural issues\u201d. The firms now plans to open fewer new Simply Food outlets, and accelerate the closure of other stores. CFO Helen Weir is also moving on. Here\u2019s the full story: Brexit continues to loom over the City of London, as the clock ticks towards 31 March 2019 when the UK is scheduled to leave the EU. The Financial Times reports that major banks warned the US commerce secretary last week that they will soon start shifting jobs out of London, unless there is more clarity. The Wall Street titans, including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, reportedly cited Britain\u2019s unstable government and the lack of progress in planning Britain\u2019s future. Collectively they employ tens of thousands of people in the City. Crucially, they warned Wilbur Ross that they are approaching the \u201cpoint of no return\u201d -- where they have to trigger their Hard Brexit contingency plans and begin shifting jobs, capital and infrastructure overseas. As the FT puts it: Those briefed on the talks, which were held over lunch at Wilton\u2019s restaurant in London\u2019s exclusive St James\u2019s district, said the banks were particularly concerned by the failure of Britain to provide clarity over whether it will secure a transition deal to smooth the changing regulatory regime after the UK leaves the EU. They warned they had even less clarity over what a final Brexit deal will look like. Absent clarity from the government about post-Brexit plans, the executives said jobs would move back to the US or to other European capitals as banks begin to enact their worst-case contingency plans, the sources said. \u201dThere was broad discussion around the lack of progress in the Brexit talks and some discussion around various political scenarios,\u201d one person briefed on the talks said. UK business chiefs have also been urging Theresa May\u2019s government to nail a transition deal by the end of this year. So, with Wall Street\u2019s major players getting nervous, the pressure is growing.... China\u2019s trade figures landed shortly before Donald Trump touched down in Beijing for a state visit. And I\u2019m sure the president will want to know that China posted a trade surplus of $26.6bn with the US in October. That\u2019s $1.5bn less than in September, but 12% higher than in October 2016. It means that China has racked up a trade surplus with the US of $223 billion so far this year, on track to match 2016\u2019s total, despite Trump\u2019s promises to trim it. US and Chinese companies are expected to sign several commercial deals during Trump\u2019s visit (these agreements are typically lined up to give politicians some good news to share). The South China Posts says Beijing has four key goals: Persuade Washington to lift export restrictions on hi-tech products, so US firms could sell more to China Create more cooperation between the US and China in research and development in fields such as space and aviation Boost US participation in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative - a massive economic expansion drive - and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Press the US to tone down its probe into alleged Chinese IP violation Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. New trade figures from China have missed expectations, which may be a sign that global growth isn\u2019t as punchy as we hoped. Chinese export growth slowed to 6.9% in October, below expectations of 7.2% growth, and down on September\u2019s robust 8.1%. Import growth also slower, rising by 17.2% last month after a blistering 18.7% in September. The figures could signal that China\u2019s economy, after a solid year, is flagging a little this autumn -- as Beijing cracks down on pollution and tries to shift from manufacturing to services. Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard says: \u201cThe big picture is that both outbound and inbound shipments have softened recently, a trend that continued last month. \u201cWe suspect that this reflects a slight easing of growth in other emerging markets along with weaker domestic demand as a result of slower infrastructure spending.\u201d Mubina Kapasi, analyst at ET Now, points out that China imported less iron ore than usual, and also shipped out less steel. Given China\u2019s key role in the world economy, these trade figures may weigh on European stock markets today.

      "bodyText": "A shortage of factory workers is starting to push up pay rates but wage rises in the services sector remain rooted at around 2%, according to the latest feedback from the Bank of England\u2019s regional agents. The central bank said its agents, which are based in offices across the country, found that shortages this month across the manufacturing sector were leading to a \u201cslight increase in pay growth\u201d that would take average rate of pay rises up by half a percent, from 2-3% this year to 2.5%-3.5% in 2018. The report appeared to justify Threadneedle Street\u2019s move last week to increase interest rates, which officials at the bank said was needed to dampen the inflationary effects of wage rises. A survey of employers in October by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation chimed with the BoE report after it found firms were having to raise their pay offers to hire new staff. The REC said the increase, the second quickest rise in wages since November 2015, followed a fall in unemployment to the lowest level in 40 years that had restricted the number of workers available to take up new positions. It warned that higher pay offers were also needed to counter a growing shortage of EU workers ahead of Brexit. \u201cWe already know that EU workers are leaving because of the uncertainties they are facing right now,\u201d said Kevin Green, REC\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe therefore need clarity around what future immigration systems will look like. Otherwise, the situation will get worse and employers will face even more staff shortages.\u201d Official data shows that in August net migration fell to its lowest level in three years, with more than half the drop caused by EU citizens leaving and fewer arriving since the Brexit vote. The REC said its survey, conducted with the data firm IHS Markit, showed that the availability of permanent and temporary workers had continued to fall sharply in October. However, shortages highlighted by recruitment agencies have yet to feed through into official pay figures, which show that average wages growth across all sectors remains muted. Figures from the Office for National Statistics estimated that average weekly earnings in the three months to August rose by just over 2% a year, below the rate of inflation, which has hit 3%. The BoE report also pointed to there probably being only modest investment in new equipment and processes by firms over the next two years due to the uncertain economic outlook. The agents said that while firms were overhauling and upgrading their IT systems, they were reluctant to commit resources to expanding production while the outcome of Brexit negotiations remained unclear. The report said: \u201cExpectations about future trading arrangements and other factors related to the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, such as concerns around the future availability of overseas labour, were also reported to be restraining investment.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Tim Martin said warnings from companies such as Sainsbury\u2019s and Whitbread about the risks of a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit were \u201cfactually incorrect and highly misleading\u201d. \u201cThe misinformation from directors and trade organisations seems to be designed to support the view that staying in the EU for an additional two years is necessary to avoid a \u2018cliff edge\u2019,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThere is no cliff edge. Wetherspoon is ready now to leave the EU, since almost no preparation is required \u2013 as is almost certainly the case for Sainsbury\u2019s and Whitbread, and the vast majority of companies,\u201d he added. Martin, a vocal Brexit supporter in the run-up to the EU referendum said it was false to claim that no deal would result in higher food and drink prices. He said it would actually knock 3.5p off the price of a Wetherspoon meal, and 0.5p off a pint. \u201cThe lowest food prices can be obtained by the UK, without the need for the agreement or consent of any third party, by avoiding a \u2018transitional deal\u2019 \u2013 which would keep EU tariffs in place \u2013 and leaving the EU in March 2019,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThis would enable the UK to scrap EU food tariffs, as permitted under World Trade Organisation rules, on food imported from outside the EU. Under WTO rules, tariffs would not then be charged on imports from the EU either.\u201d Last week the National Institute Economic Review warned that UK shopping bills would rise sharply if Britain walks away from Brexit talks without a trade deal. It predicted that the cost of European imports would jump if the UK fell back on World Trade Organisation rules. Martin made the comments as Wetherspoon reported a 6.1% increase in like-for-like sales \u2013 stripping out sales at pubs opened in the last year \u2013 for the first quarter. Total sales for the 13 weeks to 29 October were up 4.3%. Martin said the company had had a positive start to the year, but warned that costs had been significantly higher than last year, with further increases expected in areas including labour, business rates, utilities and sugar taxes. Mark Brumby, an analyst at Langton Capital, said: \u201cThe group is a superlative operator and, with Mr Martin\u2019s views on Brexit well known, the company is likely to continue to pull out all the stops to show that Brexit and the uncertainty that surrounds it will not prevent it from reporting good numbers.\u201d Wall Street banks do not share Martin\u2019s relaxed view about Brexit, though. According to the Financial Times, they told the US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross that jobs will soon start to shift out of the City, unless there is more clarity about Britain\u2019s future.",

James Finley, Keith Barnett and Louis Zuurhout, who worked in the company\u2019s energy division, entered the plea following parallel investigations by US and UK authorities into whether bribes were paid to secure overseas contracts over a 14-year period between 1999 and 2013. They are accused of being involved in schemes whereby foreign government officials received bribes in exchange for deals that benefited a Rolls-Royce subsidiary in the US, including a contract to supply equipment and services to power a gas pipeline from central Asia to China. A further individual, Andreas Kohler, who worked for an international engineering consulting firm instructed by Rolls-Royce\u2019s former customer in Kazakhstan, also entered a guilty plea. Another individual, Petros Contoguris, who worked as an intermediary for Rolls-Royce has been charged by FBI. \u201cToday\u2019s indictment and guilty pleas reveal that those associated with this corruption did knowingly conspire to break the law for their own personal gain,\u201d said Stephen Richardson, assistant director of the FBI\u2019s criminal investigative division. \u201cNo one is above the law, so let today\u2019s announcement be a warning to those who may try to perpetrate a similar scheme that the FBI will aggressively pursue those who attempt to bribe foreign officials for an unfair advantage in the global marketplace,\u201d he added. A spokesperson for the company said: \u201cRolls-Royce has committed to full ongoing co-operation with the Department of Justice and cannot comment on action against individuals.\u201d Rolls sold its energy business in 2014. In January this year, Rolls-Royce agreed to pay \u00a3671m in penalties after long-running investigations into claims it paid bribes to get export contracts. The settlement meant the FTSE 100 company would avoid prosecution by anti-corruption investigators in the UK, US and Brazil, but it did not exempt individuals. The US Justice Department said its prosecutors and FBI agents had worked closely with their counterparts in Brazil and with the SFO. Kenneth Blanco, acting assistant attorney general of the US Justice Department\u2019s criminal division, said the defendants would face justice, \u201cwhich represents another important step towards levelling the playing field for all ethical and honest businesses.\u201d The SFO said its investigation into conduct of individuals in Rolls-Royce civil, defence, marine and former energy divisions continues, in parallel with a US Department of Justice investigation.",

      "bodyText": "The new chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer has accused the struggling store chain of \u201cdrifting\u201d for more than 15 years and pledged to lead a radical shake-up of the business. \u201cThis business has been drifting, underfulfilling its customer promise not for five years, not 10 years but 15 years and maybe beyond,\u201d said the M&amp;S chairman, Archie Norman, of the company\u2019s serial financial underperformance under successive management teams. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do,\u201d said Norman, who is highly regarded for turnarounds during his career including at Asda and ITV. \u201cThis is a business that customers all want to win. There is an emotional force that wants M&amp;S to be the business they sort of remember but in a modern incarnation.\u201d Norman\u2019s comments came as the retailer confirmed it was speeding up plans to close underperforming clothing departments and putting the brakes on expansion of its Simply Food chain. It has also embarked on a five-year turnaround plan underpinned by a major cost-cutting drive to shave \u00a3340m, or 10%, from its \u00a33.4bn UK running costs. One of M&amp;S\u2019s biggest costs is its large store network. \u201cWe have made good progress in remedying the immediate and burning issues at M&amp;S,\u201d said its chief executive, Steve Rowe. \u201cThe business still has many structural issues to tackle \u2026 in the context of a challenging retail and consumer environment.\u201d The update came as M&amp;S reported underlying pre-tax profits down 5% at \u00a3219.1m for the six months to 30 September. Like-for-like food sales were down 0.1%, with profits margins squeezed by input inflation as the weakness of sterling pushed up sourcing costs. Underlying clothing sales were also flat, which was a better outcome than many analysts had predicted. The shares closed up more than 1% at 333.1p. In recent years M&amp;S has focused on the expansion of its upmarket food halls as its clothing arm struggled. But Rowe said it now faced \u201cstronger headwinds\u201d in food and needed to sharpen its prices and improve the product ranges to keep pace with rivals. It had previously announced plans for 200 new Simply Food stores by 2019, but the rate of openings will now be slowed down. \u201cThe headwinds facing our food business have intensified as competitors have encroached on some of our space with the rapid growth of convenience,\u201d said Rowe. \u201cHard-pressed consumers are more aware of value and are careful about premium choices.\u201d There was also more bad news for investors as the company revealed that it still needed to modernise its supply chain \u2013 despite a multibillion-pound investment programme under Marc Bolland, Rowe\u2019s predecessor. Its warehousing and IT needed to \u201cbe faster and lower-cost\u201d, Rowe said, as it prepared for a future where 30% of its clothing and homewares sales were online. The Whitman Howard analyst Tony Shiret said the fresh upheaval meant the burning question was: \u201cHow much should I cut my profit forecast by?\u201d \u201cThe problems are still the problems but now there are a few extra ones.\u201d Despite Norman\u2019s withering assessment of previous management teams who had had not moved fast enough in a cutthroat retail market, he was full of praise for Rowe whose actions meant \u201cwe no longer have a haemorrhaging business\u201d. The troubleshooter said Rowe had been \u201cgrasping nettles and slaughtering sacred cows\u201d as part of a successful firefighting campaign that had stabilised M&amp;S\u2019s clothing and overseas businesses. Last year, M&amp;S announced it would close 30 stores to reduce the amount of shopfloor space devoted to its struggling clothing arm by 10%. A further 45 are being downsized or converted into food-only stores. The retailer said it had decided to accelerate the closure plan after more shoppers took their business to a nearby M&amp;S store when their local branch closed. M&amp;S\u2019s mixed bag of results comes amid fears of a tough festive season on the high street after the British Retail Consortium revealed a 1% fall in like-for-like sales in October.

    "webTitle": "Low-income families will be biggest losers in next recession, says IFS", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Working families on low incomes will be among the biggest losers when the next recession hits, after their finances were weakened by welfare spending cuts in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, a leading tax and spending watchdog, said plans for a reduction in tax credits \u2013 which boost the incomes of low paid workers \u2013 will take a particularly large toll on households where one or more adults face cuts in hours or lower wages. In a recession, tax credits increase to replace a proportion of a family\u2019s lost income and act to keep low income workers and their children out of poverty. Figures covering the last recession show that inequality in the UK remained stable, despite an average fall in pre-tax earnings of more than 10%. Andrew Hood, a senior research economist at the watchdog and an author of the report, said protections offered to low-income families in the last recession would be much reduced in the next downturn, which could be five years away. The warning comes as ministers face a pressure in parliament to slow the deployment of universal credit, which is being rolled out as a replacement for six in-work benefits, including tax credits and housing benefit. Cuts in payments of universal credit have already forced thousands of families to seek support from food banks and led to an increase in arrears in council tax and rent payments, according to debt charities. The work and pensions secretary, David Gauke, has refused to delay the expansion of the social security scheme, arguing that the system delivers better incentives for people to work. The bill for tax credits and housing benefit more than doubled between 2008 and 2012 from about \u00a325bn to \u00a350bn a year. International agencies, including the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund, praised the UK for using in-work benefits to protect low-income families from worst effects of a deteriorating jobs market. But the IFS said cuts planned over the next few years will deny many families the access to the same level of in-work benefits enjoyed 10 years ago. Instead they will be more vulnerable to the effects of falling levels of pay and hours. The study shows that a repeat this year of the falls in the earnings of workers seen between 2007\u201308 and 2011\u201312 would hit the poorest 30% of working-age households with only a 39p drop in their after tax income despite a \u00a31 decline in pre-tax earnings. When benefit cuts currently being rolled out are fully in place, the IFS said that figure rises to 53p for every \u00a31. \u201cThis matters. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) puts the chances of a recession in any five-year period at 50:50. Economic uncertainty is currently high. When the next recession does hit, the tax and benefit system will offer less support to low-income households,\u201d the report said. The OBR, which is the Treasury\u2019s independent economic forecaster, is expected to downgrade its estimate for GDP growth over the life of this parliament in part due to Britain\u2019s failure to upgrade the skills of the workforce and its reliance for increases in output on sectors dominated by low-skilled, low-paid workers. Hood said: \u201cWhen governments change the tax and benefit system they should consider the impact on the support the system will provide to households when the next recession hits. \u201cPlanned cuts to working-age benefits will leave low-income households with children in particular more exposed to any future downturn in the labour market, by reducing the extent to which earnings losses would be offset by increased entitlement to benefits. This is particularly important since many in this group have little or no savings which they can draw on during a period of temporary difficulty.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Value fashion chain Primark continues to win new customers from rivals and has unveiled sales growth of more than 6%. Strong sales of homewares, childrenswear, beauty products and licensed merchandise such as Beauty &amp; the Beast and Harry Potter branded items all helped the cut-price chain put on a strong performance over the summer. A 6%-7% rise in sales at established UK stores in the six months to September contributed to a 19% total rise in sales to \u00a37.05bn for Primark in the year to the same date. Underlying operating profit climbed by 7% to \u00a3735m for the year \u2013 \u00a3150m more than the profit Marks &amp; Spencer is expected to achieve this year. The performance comes amid fears of a tough festive season looming on the high street after the British Retail Consortium revealed a 1% fall in like-for-like sales in October. John Lewis, Next and New Look have all recently reported poor trading. Primark said it had a taken a bigger slice of the womenswear market in the UK despite a fall in sales in that category. George Weston, the chief executive of the chain\u2019s owner, Associated British Foods, said the entire womenswear market had shrunk because fashion has fallen down shopping lists in favour of holidays, technology, eating out and even Netflix. \u201cWomen\u2019s fashion has been the most difficult area for the whole market but it looks like we have done better than most,\u201d he said. He said part of the problem was the \u201cathleisure\u201d trend for cheap casual sporty clothing that requires few accessories. Weston said October had been \u201cquiet\u201d as warmer weather had affected sales but that he was feeling \u201cvery bullish\u201d about Primark\u2019s Christmas ranges. Weston said Primark still has no plans to sell online as it has increased market share across 10 different countries without doing so. Primark\u2019s strong growth was reported as New Look revealed an 8.4% fall in sales at its established UK stores as its new executive chairman Alistair McGeorge said the chain\u2019s fashions had become \u201ctoo young and edgy\u201d. The company fell to an underlying operating loss of \u00a310.4m in the six months to 23 September, compared with a profit of \u00a359.3m a year. McGeorge said warm October weather and the uncertainty around Brexit were also not helping high street chains. He predicted the fashion chain\u2019s performance would not pick up until next year. McGeorge, who ran the company for three years until 2014 and has just rejoined, said the brand\u2019s problems were \u201cself-inflicted and it is only us that can fix it\u201d. \u201cThere are not that many people doing a great job for 30- and 40-year-old fashion-conscious women and there\u2019s nothing to say we can\u2019t get that sweet spot back again,\u201d he said. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

George Weston, the chief executive of the chain\u2019s owner, Associated British Foods, said the entire womenswear market had shrunk because fashion has fallen down shopping lists in favour of holidays, technology, eating out and even Netflix. </p> <p>\u201cWomen\u2019s fashion has been the most difficult area for the whole market but it looks like we have done better than most,\u201d he said.

The S&amp;P/ASX200 reached its highest level since before the global financial crisis on Tuesday and remained above the benchmark level at the close on Wednesday at 6,016 points \u2013 a slight rise on the overnight close of 6,014. A strong showing from the banks helped the market offset a negative impact on mining stocks from a dip in commodity prices. Commonwealth Bank, for example, gained 2.65% after it reported a rise in its quarterly profit to $2.65bn. Investors in Australia have been buoyed by strong leads from the US and other major markets. The MSCI all-country index burst through the 500-point mark for the first time on Tuesday. It also follows a series of record highs on Wall Street, and Monday\u2019s rally in London which pushed the FTSE 100 to a record close. On Tuesday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei also popped higher to its highest closing point in 25 years. In the US, strong profits from companies such as Apple, Amazon, Caterpillar, Mastercard, BP and Goldman Sachs have overcome concerns about the trump presidency and geopolitical issues such as tension with North Korea.

      "bodyText": "A third of cars manufactured by Volkswagen with devices to cheat emissions tests remain unfixed, two years after the scandal erupted. In what was coined the \u201cdiesel dupe\u201d, VW equipped their vehicles with defeat devices designed to realise when they were being tested so they could appear to be much less polluting than in reality. The company subsequently pledged to recall all of its cars and remove the devices. However, the monthly rate of fixes to Volkswagen manufactured cars has fallen to 2% of those affected from a previous high of 10% in February, despite the task not having been completed, according to the Department of Transport. The emissions scandal affected 1,207,152 vehicles in the UK and while two-thirds of the cars have been fixed, the rate of fixes to the remainder has stalled. An analysis showed the fix-rate of Skoda\u2019s spiked between July and August to around double that of other Volkswagen brands, an anomaly queried by Mary Creagh, Labour MP for Wakefield and chair of the environmental audit committee. The fix-rates for other brands has faltered. Creagh has written to the Department for Transport to express the committee\u2019s concerns about the lack of progress in applying fixes to cars equipped with the defeat devices. \u201cIt is over two years since the VW emissions scandal was discovered, a third of vehicles have yet to be fixed and rates have slowed considerably,\u201d said Creagh. \u201cIt is essential that the vehicles on Britain\u2019s roads adhere to emissions regulations, particularly as the country is faced with dangerous levels of pollution. The department must take responsibility for ensuring that these fixes are completed as soon as possible\u201d. A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: \u201cThe UK government continues to take the unacceptable actions of Volkswagen extremely seriously and is working hard on behalf of UK consumers.\u201d \u201cOfficials in the Department for Transport hold monthly meetings with representatives from Volkswagen for information on the number of updates applied across all of the affected brands and to press them on remaining issues.\u201d Volkswagen UK managing director Paul Willis told the Commons transport select committee in February that the firm hoped to have completed the fixing programme by autumn of this year. Greenpeace clean air campaigner Mel Evans said: \u201cTime and again VW has dodged its responsibility. \u201cIt\u2019s paid no fines, or faced criminal charges in the UK as it has in the US. \u201cNow it won\u2019t even meet its own timeline for a product recall of its dodgy diesels, which is currently the only redress on offer to the public here.\u201d The report comes the day after it was announced the UK government is being sued for a third time over the widespread illegal levels of air pollution, which cause 40,000 early deaths every year. Nitrogen dioxide pollution, largely produced by diesel vehicles, has been unlawfully high in most of urban Britain since 2010. The government\u2019s latest plan was derided as \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d by city leaders and \u201cinexcusable\u201d by doctors. Volkswagen manufacture cars for the Audi, Skoda, SEAT and VW brands, all of which were affected by the scandal that affected 11m cars worldwide. The hidden damage from VW vehicles fitted with the devices amounted to between 250,000 to 1m extra tonnes every year, according to one analysis. This could equate to all of the UK\u2019s NOx emissions from all power stations, vehicles, industry and agriculture. The car\u2019s were programmed to adjust air-fuel ratios and exhaust flows, and in some cases, to inject a solution which makes NOx harmless when they were being tested. However, when running normally, at a far greater performance level, the cars would never operate in the same way. The NOx they produced, for instance, would indeed be harmful. Following the initial revelations VW boss Michael Horn said the company had \u201ctotally screwed up\u201d, while other bosses pledged to win back trust by \u201cleaving no stone unturned\u201d.",
