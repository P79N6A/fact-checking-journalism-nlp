      "bodyText": "George Osborne will be forced into an embarrassing climbdown over next month's budget by having to admit that borrowing this year will go up, not down, according to his own independent tax and spending watchdog. Less than three months after the chancellor insisted in his autumn statement that the government's austerity programme would ensure the budget deficit fell every year, the Office for Budget Responsibility signalled that lower tax receipts and higher spending meant it was unlikely that the borrowing forecasts would be met. The OBR, which is drawing up economic and public finance forecasts for the budget on 20 March, presented its gloomy analysis after the release of unexpectedly good data which showed the exchequer in credit by \u00a311.4bn last month \u2013 the second highest January surplus on record. But the watchdog said there would have to be a marked improvement in the final two months of the 2012-13 financial year to meet the forecast in December's statement which said borrowing would fall from \u00a3121.4bn to \u00a3119.9bn this year. Osborne had used the OBR forecast to wrongfoot his Labour shadow, Ed Balls, at the autumn statement. The OBR said on Thursday that borrowing would have to be \u00a36.4bn lower than last year, in February and March, to hit the \u00a3119.9bn figure, which excludes the transfer to the Treasury of the Royal Mail pension fund and the profits made by the Bank of England on its purchases of gilts under the quantitative easing programme. \"The proceeds from the 4G spectrum auction will reduce borrowing by \u00a32.3bn in the remainder of the year,\" the OBR said. \"Nonetheless, to meet our autumn forecast would now require much stronger growth in tax receipts in the last two months of the year than we have seen since December, or much lower-than-forecast expenditure by central or local government.\" Osborne controversially included an expected \u00a33.5bn from the sale of the 4G mobile services licences in his autumn statement, thereby ensuring that borrowing fell between 2011-12 and 2012-13. A Treasury spokesman said: \"Today's public-sector finances show an improvement on last year. They underline what the governor of the Bank of England said last week: the road ahead will be difficult, but the economy is on the right track. The deficit has been cut by a quarter in two years and over a million private-sector jobs have been created.\" Chris Leslie, shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Strip away the smoke and mirrors \u2013 like the transfer of cash from the Bank of England \u2013 and underlying borrowing so far this year is rising and is \u00a35.3bn higher than the same period last year. \"A flatlining economy means the government is borrowing more to pay for economic failure as the welfare bill is up. By failing on growth and jobs, David Cameron and George Osborne are failing on the one test they set themselves \u2013 to get the deficit and debt down.\" Separate analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the UK's leading thinktank on public finances, suggested that after a year of flat output, borrowing in 2012-13 would be \u00a37bn higher than in 2011-12. Rowena Crawford, an IFS researcher, said: \"As the chancellor prepares for his budget next month, he will likely be disappointed by today's public finance figures.\" January tends to be one of the year's biggest months for tax collection, and the surplus last month was higher than in the same month a year earlier, even when special factors such as the \u00a33.8bn payment by the Bank to the Treasury of QE profits were taken into account. Stripped of all the special factors the government was in the black by \u00a37.8bn in January 2013, up from \u00a36.4bn in January 2012. But Crawford said tax receipts were running below the growth forecast for the year as a whole, while spending continued target as a result of welfare benefit payments and higher outlays by Whitehall departments. \"As a result borrowing is now on course to be almost \u00a37bn higher this year than the OBR forecast in December. Therefore borrowing is more likely to be slightly higher rather than slightly lower than last year's level, although much uncertainty remains and things could still change in the final two months of the year.\" Further austerity would be needed if the outlook for the deficit failed to improve, Crawford added. \"What matters more than the level of borrowing this year is the outlook for revenues and spending in the medium term. Some of the extra borrowing so far this year is due to Whitehall departments under-spending by less than assumed. \"This may not persist and therefore might not concern the chancellor, in particular if the money is being spent well. Potentially more concerning is the low growth in tax receipts and the high growth in spending on welfare benefits: were these to persist in to future years then the planned fiscal tightening might need to be increased.\"",

No I can't, but our core objective would be to not pass it on,\" Asda's chief executive, Andy Clarke, said on Thursday.</p> <p>The head of Britain's second largest supermarket chain said retailers faced a challenging year in 2013. Speaking as Asda reported a 1% increase in like-for-like sales for 2012, Clarke said: \"It's likely to be a challenging and uncertain year ahead and so we will continue to focus on the customer and adapt the business to their needs. By doing this I'm confident we have a strong business that can drive growth in a sustainable way.\"</p> <p>Clarke added that Asda had taken a \u00a3100m hit to keep its Essentials range of bread, eggs, sugar and milk at the same price in order to retain cost-fixated customers. \"We took a very conscious decision as an organisation \u2026 that meant that we were going to hold back inflation to grow volume.\"</p> <p>Clarke expects customers to feel the pinch even more with changes to child benefit and other welfare cuts, which he said would affect sales.</p> <p>While store sales remained stagnant, however, online shopping and click-and-collect services have soared.

      "bodyText": "Asda has warned that it expects an uncertain year ahead and does not rule out meat price increases as a result of the horsemeat scandal. \"Can I say that nothing will be passed on [to consumers]? No I can't, but our core objective would be to not pass it on,\" Asda's chief executive, Andy Clarke, said on Thursday. The head of Britain's second largest supermarket chain said retailers faced a challenging year in 2013. Speaking as Asda reported a 1% increase in like-for-like sales for 2012, Clarke said: \"It's likely to be a challenging and uncertain year ahead and so we will continue to focus on the customer and adapt the business to their needs. By doing this I'm confident we have a strong business that can drive growth in a sustainable way.\" Clarke added that Asda had taken a \u00a3100m hit to keep its Essentials range of bread, eggs, sugar and milk at the same price in order to retain cost-fixated customers. \"We took a very conscious decision as an organisation \u2026 that meant that we were going to hold back inflation to grow volume.\" Clarke expects customers to feel the pinch even more with changes to child benefit and other welfare cuts, which he said would affect sales. While store sales remained stagnant, however, online shopping and click-and-collect services have soared. Asda's online sales increased 18.8% last year, making it the fastest growing area of the business.The company said 40% of online groceries sales were now collected in store, with 16% of online orders placed via a mobile phone. Click-and-collect has become so popular the company has opened its first collection-only depot for customers at an office site in Reading. It was George from Asda clothing that outperformed the rest of the business and pushed the brand into the number three position on the high street for clothes sales behind Primark and Marks &amp; Spencer. George from Asda now has a market share of 11%. Around a third of clothes sales in the UK were at a discount, while only 16% of clothes sold by George were reduced. Sales of onesies were particularly popular, with 1m units sold in the past year. Unveiling its results, the company focused heavily on its non-food range, as it continues to battle negative headlines relating to the horsemeat scandal. Clarke said he was shocked by the horsemeat revelations, but said he would leave \"no stone unturned\" in dealing with the crisis. He added that all 180,000 staff, including the board that oversaw the horsemeat scandal, would receive a bonus this year. Asda's sales update was released as its parent company Wal-Mart reported a rise in profits to $5.9bn (\u00a33.9bn) in the three months to the end of January.",

What a pity the UK energy companies would not say the same thing. Only on Wednesday, one of the Big Six power companies, RWE npower, unleashed the latest salvo of criticism about muddled thinking by Number 10. There is some irony that Britain spends \u00a340bn a year of taxpayers' money on keeping the military on active service abroad and yet risks the lights going out at home because cash will not be spent on energy security. Around \u00a3120bn is needed in the medium term to modernise UK power infrastructure so that it is suitably equipped for a low-carbon world where demand can be met in an era of climate change and rising global temperatures. Much of that cash can be expected to come from the energy suppliers and the bulk of that will ultimately be taken from the consumer in the way of higher energy bills. But given the rising scale of fuel poverty in Britain, why can't the Treasury play a more active role? Even the government's much-vaunted Green Investment Bank \u2013 meant to kickstart wind and other renewable energy projects \u2013 will have pitiful amounts of money available. Its ability to borrow has been drastically delayed till at least 2016/17. All those depressed coastal cities such as Barrow-in-Furness \u2013 centre of BAE's submarine business \u2013 that have become desperately dependent on public defence spending could play a role in energy security. They could build gas and wind turbines rather than just submarines. Not so many people would mind subsidies being available for the nuclear industry if the playing field was flattened to ensure that renewables and other technologies were given equal help. Alistair Buchanan, the energy regulator, warned this week that Britain was on a \"rollercoaster\". A combination of old coal and atomic power plants closing, and foreign gas supplies shrinking, had left future domestic energy reserves \"uncomfortably tight\". The energy companies \u2013 unlovable though they are with their doorstep misselling, deliberately complex tariffs and executive pay excess \u2013 need encouragement to invest in new plants by long-term government policies. The UK consumer \u2013 householders and businesses \u2013 can benefit most from a massive drive for energy efficiency. That drive is way beyond the limited scope of the Green Deal or just switching energy suppliers. Cameron should realise a true UK defence policy begins at home.

      "body": "<p>BrewDog, the independent brewer that at one time made the world's strongest beer, is to open its first bars outside the UK this year as it cashes in on a growing interest in locally brewed ales.</p> <p>The Aberdeenshire company, which makes craft beers including Punk IPA and Trashy Blonde is to open bars in Stockholm in Sweden and S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil and potentially two other locations. Another six bars will be added to the UK chain of 10 after BrewDog opened a \u00a37.8m new brewery to cope with demand.</p> <p>James Watt, co-founder, said: \"More and more people are becoming frustrated at the lack of choice in the UK beer industry which is dominated by faceless corporations making lowest-common-denominator yellow liquid.\"</p> <p>As part of its attempt to challenge mainstream brewers it fought a kind of alcohol arms race with a German brewery, Schorschbr\u00e4u, to claim the world's strongest beer, which culminated for BrewDog in 12 bottles of a 55% beer it named \"The End of History\" \u2013 Schorschbr\u00e4u later took back the crown with a 57% ABV beer less creatively named Schorschbock 57.</p> <p>He said BrewDog's bars offer more choice of beers from a selection of brewers from around the world alongside its own beers, which it claims pack more flavour than mass-produced rivals. It tries to employ knowledgeable staff and holds tasting sessions where drinkers can learn about the process of brewing. \"We want to elevate the status of beer,\" Watts said.</p> <p>BrewDog is part of a new wave of breweries springing up in the UK making \"craft beer\", a loose term for more strongly flavoured beers produced by enthusiasts, usually on a relatively small scale.

      "bodyText": "BrewDog, the independent brewer that at one time made the world's strongest beer, is to open its first bars outside the UK this year as it cashes in on a growing interest in locally brewed ales. The Aberdeenshire company, which makes craft beers including Punk IPA and Trashy Blonde is to open bars in Stockholm in Sweden and S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil and potentially two other locations. Another six bars will be added to the UK chain of 10 after BrewDog opened a \u00a37.8m new brewery to cope with demand. James Watt, co-founder, said: \"More and more people are becoming frustrated at the lack of choice in the UK beer industry which is dominated by faceless corporations making lowest-common-denominator yellow liquid.\" As part of its attempt to challenge mainstream brewers it fought a kind of alcohol arms race with a German brewery, Schorschbr\u00e4u, to claim the world's strongest beer, which culminated for BrewDog in 12 bottles of a 55% beer it named \"The End of History\" \u2013 Schorschbr\u00e4u later took back the crown with a 57% ABV beer less creatively named Schorschbock 57. He said BrewDog's bars offer more choice of beers from a selection of brewers from around the world alongside its own beers, which it claims pack more flavour than mass-produced rivals. It tries to employ knowledgeable staff and holds tasting sessions where drinkers can learn about the process of brewing. \"We want to elevate the status of beer,\" Watts said. BrewDog is part of a new wave of breweries springing up in the UK making \"craft beer\", a loose term for more strongly flavoured beers produced by enthusiasts, usually on a relatively small scale. Summer Wine Brewery, Thornbridge Brewery and Camden Brewery are all generally agreed to be part of the movement which accounts for about 5% of UK beer sales, according to Euromonitor.

January is an important month for receipts but, although growth in income tax receipts was strong, this was partially offset by very weak growth in corporation tax receipts. Together this leaves tax receipts running below the growth forecast for the year as a whole. Spending continues to run higher than forecast, due to strong growth in spending on both welfare benefits and on the delivery and administration of public services.</p> <p>As a result borrowing is now on course to be almost \u00a37bn higher this year than the OBR forecast in December. Therefore borrowing is more likely to be slightly higher rather than slightly lower than last year's level, although much uncertainty remains and things could still change in the final two months of the year.</p> <p>What matters more than the level of borrowing this year is the outlook for revenues and spending in the medium term. Some of the extra borrowing so far this year is due to Whitehall departments underspending by less than assumed. This may not persist and therefore might not concern the chancellor - in particular if the money is being spent well.</p> <p>Potentially more concerning is the low growth in tax receipts and the high growth in spending on welfare benefits: were these to persist into future years then the large planned fiscal tightening might need to be increased.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-02-21T15:02:28.657Z\">at 3.02pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5126325f95cb9676d7dbd9a1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-21T14:42:39.941Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Dutch consumer morale hits a low</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are clouds gathering over the Netherlands, with reams of data out today showing it could struggle to hold onto its prized triple-A credit rating.

But it is expected to stay weak, as a result of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/feb/20/bank-england-governor-outvoted-qe-mervyn-king\">signs the Bank of England could expand the quantitative easing programme</a>.</p> <p>Sterling was down 0.1% on the day at $1.5223, recovering for a two-and-a-half-year low it hit earlier in the day.</p> <p>But, says Nick Beecroft of Saxo Bank, the UK is very much back in the currency wars.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When the UK economy hit the doldrums in the wake of the credit crunch in 2008, authorities were left with two main weapons to fight their way out of recession: low interest rates and a weaker sterling to help boost exports. Given that, historically, low rates have failed to boost consumer spending by alleviating households\u2019 debt burden, UK policy makers will be tempted to manipulate their currency.</p> <p>When asked about the perceived potential benefits of QE, central bankers of the US, UK and the Eurozone will wax lyrical about some combination of improved monetary transmission, improved sentiment through higher asset prices, cheaper government bond rates, leading to lower mortgage rates and project discount rates, and fear of inflation which promotes near term consumption, but the one benefit that dare not speak its name is currency debasement. We\u2019ll never hear an explicit admission from any of those central banks, that a major corollary benefit of their QE programme is a decline in the value of their currency. That would be tantamount to a declaration of economic war - a trade war - such as the one which so damagingly extended and deepened the 1930\u2019s Depression.<br>&#xa0;<br>The trouble is that, with the political uncertainty about the future of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU hampering investments and British export performances since 2000 being the worst among the G20 nations, achieving economic growth will be difficult. The question is: how long will the Bank of England be able to keep its powder dry and refrain from currency devaluation.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-02-21T12:25:41.545Z\">at 12.25pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5126074395cb9676d7dbd95d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-21T11:38:43.503Z\">11.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK factory orders better than expected</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to the UK, where factory orders improved more than expected in February.</p> <p><strong>The CBI's industrial trends survey rose to -14 from -20 in January, beating expectations of a reading of -15. </strong></p> <p>Of the 436 manufacturers, 15% responded that total order books were above normal and 29% said they were below, giving a balance of -14%</p> <p>The export order book balance also rose to -20 from -29.</p> <p>Anna Leach of the CBI said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rebound in manufacturing orders and expectations for output growth provide some further signs of improvement in the outlook for the UK economy.

Without a credible plan from the government to break the vicious circle of a sluggish economy, low tax revenues and rising public sector borrowing, the credit rating agencies are likely to lose their patience.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-02-21T11:14:09.006Z\">at 11.14am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5125f0b895cb9676d7dbd92d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-21T10:02:32.136Z\">10.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">QE 'profits' reduce UK deficit less than hoped</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It should be noted, the UK public finances data enjoyed a \u00a33.8bn boost from 'profits' from the Bank of England's holdings in the gilt market, as a result of the quantitative easing programme.</p> <p>But the ONS estimates that this <strong>interest income will only reduce the deficit by \u00a36.4bn, significantly less than the \u00a311.5bn the government's independent budget watchdog estimated in December</strong>.</p> <p>Reuters writes that this is because the ONS would not allow the full amount transferred to count towards reducing the budget deficit. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-02-21T10:10:03.451Z\">at 10.10am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5125efb795cb9676d7dbd92c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-21T09:58:15.616Z\">9.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK data cuts threat of AAA downgrade - economist</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The UK could escape the embarrassing fate of losing its prized triple-A credit rating, writes James Knightley of ING, following better than expected public finances data (see below). </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This may be perceived as lowering the threat of an imminent AAA rating downgrade from one of the major ratings agencies and so is going to be a short term positive for sterling.</p> </blockquote> <p>But George Osborne still faces a difficult decision at next month's budget, writes Capital Economics:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With borrowing still very high and fiscal progress appearing to have ground to a halt, the dilemma faced by the Chancellor at next month\u2019s Budget over whether to tighten fiscal policy, or loosen and go for growth, remains acute.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5125ee0e95cb9676d7dbd92a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-21T09:51:10.161Z\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">But UK borrowing still higher than last tax year</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>But it is still not clear whether the UK chancellor will be able to say that deficit reduction is on track when he presents his budget in less than a month.</p> <p><strong>Borrowing since the start of the tax year in April 2012 came to \u00a393.8bn, excluding a one-off boost from the transfer of&#xa0;Royal Mail&#xa0;pension assets.</strong></p> <p>That is 1.6% higher than at the same point in the 2011/12 tax year, and Osborne faces a tough task to meet his target to bring full-year borrowing down to \u00a3108.5bn, from around \u00a3120bn in 2011/12.</p> <p>Marc Otswald of Monument Securities says, leaving aside the slightly larger than expected monthly surplus, there is nothing to comfort Osborne in the data.

European markets have been hammered today, on the back of data showing the French economy continues to falter, and fears that the US could switch off its stimulus programme. UK FTSE 100: down 1.64%, or 105 points, at 6290 France CAC 40: down 1.87% Germany DAX: down 1.68% Spain IBEX: down 1.72% Italy FTSE MIB: down 2.81% Back to the UK's public finance data again (see 9.40am and following), which the highly-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies says will be a disappointment for George Osborne Rowena Crawford at the IFS said: As the chancellor prepares for his budget next month, he will likely be disappointed by today's public finance figures. January is an important month for receipts but, although growth in income tax receipts was strong, this was partially offset by very weak growth in corporation tax receipts. Together this leaves tax receipts running below the growth forecast for the year as a whole. Spending continues to run higher than forecast, due to strong growth in spending on both welfare benefits and on the delivery and administration of public services. As a result borrowing is now on course to be almost \u00a37bn higher this year than the OBR forecast in December. Therefore borrowing is more likely to be slightly higher rather than slightly lower than last year's level, although much uncertainty remains and things could still change in the final two months of the year. What matters more than the level of borrowing this year is the outlook for revenues and spending in the medium term. Some of the extra borrowing so far this year is due to Whitehall departments underspending by less than assumed. This may not persist and therefore might not concern the chancellor - in particular if the money is being spent well. Potentially more concerning is the low growth in tax receipts and the high growth in spending on welfare benefits: were these to persist into future years then the large planned fiscal tightening might need to be increased. There are clouds gathering over the Netherlands, with reams of data out today showing it could struggle to hold onto its prized triple-A credit rating. An unholy trinity of releases showed: Consumer confidence hit its lowest point since records began in 1986, at -44 points Unemployment hit its highest level in around 16 years House prices dropped at their sharpest rate over a year since 1995 And here comes US manufacturing PMI data, which looks pretty good. The pace of growth of the factory sector slowed in February, but remained near a nine-month peak thanks to strong domestic demand. Markit's manufacturing PMI came dropped back to 55.2 from 55.8, still comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. But job creation in the sector hit a three-month low. Chris Williamson at Markit said: While the survey therefore paints an encouraging picture of the manufacturing sector, helping to drive a return to growth for the economy as a whole in the first quarter of this year, firms still need to see greater confidence in the longer-term economic outlook for employment numbers to pick up again. Back to Ireland, which is apparently looking to issue a 10-year bond in the first half of this year. Reuters reports that Irish finance minister, Michael Noonan, who is on a visit to London, said Ireland wanted to prove it is ready to exit its bailout programme. I think the issuance will be 10-year and that will be one of the serious tests of market conditions and of our ability to get back into the market. I would like that we would be back in the markets fully by 2014... and at present I think we are on track. Panic-driven austerity in the eurozone produced the double-dip recession and could have even more dire consequences, write two economists on the VOX blog. Paul De Grauwe of the London School of Economics and Yuemei Ji of the University of Leuven argue that fear and panic led to excessive, and possibly self-defeating, austerity in the south while failing to induce offsetting stimulus in the north. The conclude that resistance to austerity measures could once again raise the spectre of countries wishing to leave the eurozone. The intense austerity programs that have been dictated by financial markets create new risks for the eurozone. While the ECB 2012 decision to be a lender of last resort in the government bond markets eliminated the existential fears about the future of the eurozone, the new risks for the future of the eurozone now have shifted into the social and political sphere. As it becomes obvious that the austerity programmes produce unnecessary sufferings especially for the millions of people who have been thrown into unemployment and poverty, resistance against these programs is likely to increase. A resistance that may lead millions of people to wish to be liberated from what they perceive to be shackles imposed by the euro. More US data reveals that jobless claims across the Atlantic rose more than expected last week, but remain at levels consistent with a steady improvement in the jobs market. Initial claims for unemployment benefits rose 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 362,000, compared with forecasts of 355,000. Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, told Bloomberg: Businesses just seem to be sitting tight with regard to layoffs, which is reason for optimism. If we get through these hurdles over the next couple months the job market should begin to improve more noticeably. US inflation was unchanged in January, which should make it easier for the Federal Reserve to maintain its ambitious stimulus programme. Official data showed that weak petrol and food prices helped suppress annual inflation, which came in at 1.6%, down from 1.7% in December. The French minister who recieved a letter lambasting the \"lazy\" French (see 8.50am) has retaliated, reports the Telegraph. Arnaud Montebourg, minister for industrial renewal in France, told Maurice Taylor, chief executive of US tyremaker Titan: Your comments, which are as extremist as they are insulting, display a perfect ignorance of our country, France. He pointed out that since Titan is \"20 times smaller\" than \"French technology leader\" Michelin, which is \"35 times more profitable\", Taylor \"could have learned and gained enormously from a French base.\" The pound regained some ground today against the dollar, after the better-than-expected public finances data. But it is expected to stay weak, as a result of signs the Bank of England could expand the quantitative easing programme. Sterling was down 0.1% on the day at $1.5223, recovering for a two-and-a-half-year low it hit earlier in the day. But, says Nick Beecroft of Saxo Bank, the UK is very much back in the currency wars. When the UK economy hit the doldrums in the wake of the credit crunch in 2008, authorities were left with two main weapons to fight their way out of recession: low interest rates and a weaker sterling to help boost exports. Given that, historically, low rates have failed to boost consumer spending by alleviating households\u2019 debt burden, UK policy makers will be tempted to manipulate their currency. When asked about the perceived potential benefits of QE, central bankers of the US, UK and the Eurozone will wax lyrical about some combination of improved monetary transmission, improved sentiment through higher asset prices, cheaper government bond rates, leading to lower mortgage rates and project discount rates, and fear of inflation which promotes near term consumption, but the one benefit that dare not speak its name is currency debasement. We\u2019ll never hear an explicit admission from any of those central banks, that a major corollary benefit of their QE programme is a decline in the value of their currency. That would be tantamount to a declaration of economic war - a trade war - such as the one which so damagingly extended and deepened the 1930\u2019s Depression. The trouble is that, with the political uncertainty about the future of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU hampering investments and British export performances since 2000 being the worst among the G20 nations, achieving economic growth will be difficult. The question is: how long will the Bank of England be able to keep its powder dry and refrain from currency devaluation. Back to the UK, where factory orders improved more than expected in February. The CBI's industrial trends survey rose to -14 from -20 in January, beating expectations of a reading of -15. Of the 436 manufacturers, 15% responded that total order books were above normal and 29% said they were below, giving a balance of -14% The export order book balance also rose to -20 from -29. Anna Leach of the CBI said: The rebound in manufacturing orders and expectations for output growth provide some further signs of improvement in the outlook for the UK economy. However, exports order books are likely to remain relatively weak until global conditions, especially in the eurozone, improve more markedly. Sticking with Ireland, Irish finance minister Michael Noonan says he expects a compromise to be secured on a proposal to cap bankers' bonuses. His view is of particular interest as Ireland currently holds the European Union's rotating presidency. Negotiations to introduce a cap on bankers' bonuses in the European Union stalled on Tuesday after EU countries and the bloc's parliament clashed over how far to go in curbing pay for the industry's top earners. Noonan said on Bloomberg TV: We think there is a median where a settlement can be reached without upsetting the cost base in the city of London or without depriving people of rightfully earned bonuses. But is has to be done in a new formulation. Over to the debt markets, where Spain has sold more bonds than targeted, thanks to strong demand. Madrid sold \u20ac4.2bn of debt due in 2015, 2019 and 2023, compared with a target of \u20ac3bn-\u20ac4bn, and borrowing costs eased. The bond due in 2019 had an average yield of 4.275%, almost 2.5 percentage points lower than yields paid at its last outing in July, at the height of worries about the eurozone. The bond due in 2015 had an average yield of 2.54%, compared with 2.82% in February. The bond due in 2023 sold at a yield of 5.2%, in its first auction since it was introduced. But traders said the sale was helped by the amount of money central banks are pumping into markets. Lyn Graham-Taylor at Rabobank said: This is a strong set of results and continues the theme of decent demand for Spanish debt. We still believe this to be largely driven by the large amount of central bank liquidity in the system rather than an improvement in the fundamentals of Spain and major progress towards fiscal union being made by the eurozone. Ireland, meanwhile, sold \u20ac500m of three-month Treasury bills at a yield of 0.24% \u2013 close to the lowest levels it has reached since Ireland returned to the debt markets last year. Here's David Tinsley of BNP Paribas on the UK public finances data. It seems the longer the economists have taken to digest the figures, the gloomier they are... The UK public sector finances get more confused with reclassifications by the month. But looking through the smoke, things don't look too jolly. The figures are being flattered by one-offs, but the big picture is the consolidation effort stalled in 2012/13. Indeed, the underlying deficit actually rose a little. The best one can say is that it is against a backdrop where the economy showed zero growth, so at least the rise wasn't larger. But there may be a storm brewing if the economy doesn't show some growth soon. The president of the European parliament has told Italians not to vote for Silvio Berlusconi in this weekend's elections, in what looks like an unwise move that could easily backfire. Martin Schulz \u2013 once compared to a Nazi concentration camp guard by Berlusconi \u2013 urged Italian voters to 'make the right choice'. He said: Silvio Berlusconi has already sent Italy into a tailspin with irresponsible behaviour in government and personal escapades. Much is at stake in the forthcoming elections, including making sure that the confidence built up by (prime minister) Mario Monti is not lost. I am very confident that Italian voters will make the right choice for their country. The fear is that his comments will prompt a backlash in Italy. Here's Chris Williamson on the public finances data, which he says makes it likely the UK will lose its triple-A rating. The government's borrowing target for the year of \u00a3108.5bn is still looking unrealistic. Borrowing for the year is now looking likely to come in around \u00a35-10bn higher than the government was hoping, and could easily end up higher than the \u00a3120bn seen in 2011-12 if tax revenues continue to disappoint. With borrowing rising and the economy stagnating over the past year, the UK's AAA credit rating is looking increasingly at risk. The spring budget will need to address the concern that more stimulus is needed besides central bank action in order to get the economy on a sustainable recovery path. Without a credible plan from the government to break the vicious circle of a sluggish economy, low tax revenues and rising public sector borrowing, the credit rating agencies are likely to lose their patience. It should be noted, the UK public finances data enjoyed a \u00a33.8bn boost from 'profits' from the Bank of England's holdings in the gilt market, as a result of the quantitative easing programme. But the ONS estimates that this interest income will only reduce the deficit by \u00a36.4bn, significantly less than the \u00a311.5bn the government's independent budget watchdog estimated in December. Reuters writes that this is because the ONS would not allow the full amount transferred to count towards reducing the budget deficit. The UK could escape the embarrassing fate of losing its prized triple-A credit rating, writes James Knightley of ING, following better than expected public finances data (see below). This may be perceived as lowering the threat of an imminent AAA rating downgrade from one of the major ratings agencies and so is going to be a short term positive for sterling. But George Osborne still faces a difficult decision at next month's budget, writes Capital Economics: With borrowing still very high and fiscal progress appearing to have ground to a halt, the dilemma faced by the Chancellor at next month\u2019s Budget over whether to tighten fiscal policy, or loosen and go for growth, remains acute. But it is still not clear whether the UK chancellor will be able to say that deficit reduction is on track when he presents his budget in less than a month. Borrowing since the start of the tax year in April 2012 came to \u00a393.8bn, excluding a one-off boost from the transfer of Royal Mail pension assets. That is 1.6% higher than at the same point in the 2011/12 tax year, and Osborne faces a tough task to meet his target to bring full-year borrowing down to \u00a3108.5bn, from around \u00a3120bn in 2011/12. Marc Otswald of Monument Securities says, leaving aside the slightly larger than expected monthly surplus, there is nothing to comfort Osborne in the data. He points out some of the low lights of the ONS report (citing figures for the tax year to date, compared with the same period in the previous tax year): - Income Tax receipts a little lower but that is no surprise given a weak economy - Corporation Tax still very weak \u00a336.8bn vs. \u00a340.5bn - VAT receipts up: \u00a385bn vs. \u00a383.8bn, but that is in fact less than the pace of inflation... so weak - Outlays - horrible, net departmental outlays \u00a3476.9bn vs. \u00a3466.3bn, with some offset from Interest payments due to fall in Gilt yields - so much for getting the budget under control There was good news for George Osborne this morning, with Britain's public finances showing a bigger than expected surplus in January. The government's preferred measure of public borrowing, which strips out some of the effects of its bank bailouts, showed a surplus of \u00a311.4bn in January. That is up from \u00a36.4bn pounds in January 2012 and above analysts' forecasts of a surplus of \u00a38.15bn. January is typically a good month for tax receipts, as it marks the deadline for self-assessed tax returns to be paid. The ECB's bond-buying programme may have improved sentiment but it has not lifted economic activity, says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. The purchasing managers survey reinforce concern that while the eurozone economic environment has been helped by a marked reduction in sovereign debt tensions, lower bond yields and improved business confidence since late-2012 (largely due to the ECB unveiling its bond buying policy) this is still not really feeding through to lift economic activity. He says the data could push the ECB to cut rates. The relapse in manufacturing and services activity in February puts renewed pressure on the ECB to cut interest rates, especially given the recent strength of the euro. We suspect that the ECB will remain reluctant to trim interest rates for now, but it could buckle if the eurozone continues to falter. Here's Capital Economics on the eurozone data. The fall in the composite eurozone PMI in February puts a dent in hopes that the region would emerge from recession in the first quarter. On past form, the index points to a quarterly fall in GDP of about 0.3%, after Q4\u2019s 0.6% fall.... The fall in the French PMI is more worrying \u2013 at face value the index is now consistent with a 1% quarterly fall in GDP. In all, then, the latest PMI number supports our view that the improvement in the financial markets will not be enough on its own to kick start an economic recovery. Ouch. Eurozone PMIs do not look good, with services dropping in February, dashing hopes that the region could emerge from a recession soon. The flash services PMI \u2013 one of the earliest monthly indicators of economic activity in the region \u2013 dropped from 48.6 to 47.3 in February, a big miss from analyst expectations of a rise to 49. Chris Williamson of Markit highlighted the growing divide between Germany and France. Digging into the data shows increasing schisms within the eurozone. National divergences between France and Germany have widened so far this year to the worst seen since the survey began in 1998. Germany is on course to grow in the first quarter. In contrast, Frances\u2019s downturn is likely to deepen, bringing the euro area\u2019s second-largest member more in line with the periphery than with the now solitary-looking German \u2018core\u2019. Here's Markit's graph showing just how bad it looks in France. The composite PMI, which usually preempts GDP data fairly accurately, is sliding dramatically. This morning the French media suggested the EU Commission is expected to cut its already grim forecast for France's economy and budget deficit this year, citing a report due out Friday. Le Monde and Le Point reported that the commission's economic experts have reduced their forecast for France's economic growth this year to 0.1% from 0.4%. The country's deficit is now forecast at 3.6% of GDP, up from a prior estimate of 3.5%, which would miss the Maastricht treaty target of 3%. France is the second largest economy in the eurozone and problems there signal problems right at the very heart of the currency bloc. One man will be unsurprised by the miserable data out of France (see 8.20am) and that is Maurice \"Morry\" Taylor Jr, the head of US tyre company Titan International, which yesterday launched a blistering attack on the French work ethic. My colleague Kim Wilsher in Paris reports: Taylor, a 1996 US Republican presidential candidate, revealed he was no loss to the international diplomatic service in his letter to the minister, who had suggested he might like to take over a Goodyear tyre factory in the economically struggling industrial heartland of northern France, near Amiens. \"Do you think we're stupid?\" Taylor wrote to Montebourg in the letter, which was made public on Wednesday. \"I've visited this factory several times. The French workers are paid high wages but only work three hours. They have one hour for their lunch, they talk for three hours and they work for three hours. I said this directly to their union leaders; they replied that's the way it is in France. Over to the markets, which are suffering after minutes released last night showed signs of a split over the US Federal Reserve's stimulus programme. UK FTSE 100: down 1.2%, or 80 points, at 6314 France CAC 40: down 1.2% Germany DAX: down 1.2% Spain IBEX: down 1.75% Italy FTSE MIB: down 2% German business activity, meanwhile, increased for a third straight month in February, adding to signs the region's largest economy is rebounding after GDP declined in the fourth quarter. The data points to a widening gulf between it and the region's second largest economy, France, which continues to flounder. The German composite PMI, which accounts for more than two thirds of the economy, stood at 52.7 in February. That was down from January's 54.4, but still comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Tim Moore at Markit said: Despite the slight loss of momentum since January, the survey suggests that Germany can still be relied upon as an engine for the eurozone. While we wait for Germany's PMIs, check out the Guardian's spread on Italy in the paper this morning. My colleague Lizzie Davies in Rome numbers the six things wrong with Italy and how to solve them, starting with the effects of austerity. She goes on to highlight the plight of women in the country run for years by Silvio Berlusconi, a man better known for his bunga bunga parties than anything else. She writes: Held back by ingrained cultural attitudes, inadequate public services and political under-representation, they may have better educational qualifications than their male counterparts but they are significantly less likely to be in paid work. The French data is predictably bad. The French services sector shrank in February at its fastest rate in nearly four years, suggesting it is far from a turnaround. The services PMI came in at 42.7 in February, compared with 43.6 last month. The manufacturing index ticked up to 43.6, but remains well below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. The composite PMI, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of French economic output, dropped to 42.3 from 42.7 in January. Chris Williamson at Markit said: There is a fairly consistent picture showing that the French business sector is suffering its worst downturn since the height of the financial crisis. A quick look at today's agenda, before we plunge into the French PMIs. France PMIs for February: 7.58am Merkel addresses the Bundestag on the EU budget: 8am Rajoy speaks in State of Nation debate: 8am Italian election candidates hold press conference: 8.10am Germany PMIs for February: 8.28am Eurozone PMIs for February: 8.58am UK public sector borrowing for January: 9.30am UK CBI trends for February: 11am US inflation for January: 1.30pm US weekly jobless claims: 1.30pm US PMIs for February: 1.58pm In the debt markets, the UK is selling a \u00a32.25bn of a 10-year gilt; while Spain is selling \u20ac3bn-\u20ac4bn of bonds maturing in 2015, 2019 and 2023. Good morning and welcome back to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis and other global economic events. The state of the French economy will be in focus this morning, with eurozone PMIs set to show a widening gulf between France and Germany. UK chancellor George Osborne will also be in the spotlight when the public sector borrowing figures are released. These could offer some relief after the miserable 4G auction proceeds, as January is traditionally a strong month for tax receipts. Later in the day, we've got a Spanish 10-year bond auction, as Mariano Rajoy's government continues to take advantage of lower rates. And there's a key UK gilt auction, which could suffer from the news that Mervyn King voted for more QE at the Bank of England's last meeting.",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 108 points, erasing two days of gains.</p> <p>Since the financial crisis, Bernanke has presided over a massive financial aid initiative with three rounds of quantitative easing (QE) aimed at stimulating lending and jobs growth.

      "bodyText": "A split is emerging in the Federal Reserve as officials worry that chairman Ben Bernanke's $85bn-a-month efforts to bring down unemployment may backfire. According to the minutes of the last Fed meeting, released on Wednesday, a number of senior officials were concerned about the risks involved in the Fed's massive bond-buying programme, and warned that the initiative might be hard to stop in the future. The news triggered a sell-off in the US stock markets, with all the major indices falling after the minutes' release. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 108 points, erasing two days of gains. Since the financial crisis, Bernanke has presided over a massive financial aid initiative with three rounds of quantitative easing (QE) aimed at stimulating lending and jobs growth. The latest round will reach $1.14tn before the first quarter of 2014, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. Bernanke is reportedly not seeking a third term as chairman, and the minutes show he clearly has the support of most Fed members. But they also provide the strongest sign yet that dissent towards his policies is growing. \"Several participants stressed the economic and social costs of high unemployment,\" the minutes said. \"However, many participants also expressed some concerns about potential costs and risks arising from further asset purchases.\" According to the minutes, \"a number of participants\" wanted closer scrutiny of the efficacy, costs and risks of the asset-purchase programme. They appear concerned that the risks of the program may now outweigh the benefits, and suggest the committee could reduce or stop the initiative before Bernanke hits his target rate for unemployment. \"A number of participants stated that an ongoing evaluation of the efficacy, costs, and risks of asset purchases might well lead the committee to taper or end its purchases before it judged that a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market had occurred,\" the minutes state. However, it is clear that Bernanke's supporters remain in the majority and do not want to call time on the asset-buying scheme too early. \"A few participants noted examples of past instances in which policymakers had prematurely removed accommodation, with adverse effects on economic growth, employment, and price stability,\" the minutes said. \"They also stressed the importance of communicating the committee's commitment to maintaining a highly accommodative stance of policy as long as warranted by economic conditions.\" The Fed plans to evaluate how its programmes are doing at its next meeting March 19 and 20, and Bernanke will answer questions at a press conference following that meeting. Paul Ashworth, the chief US economist at Capital Economics, described the minutes as \"something of an eye-opener\". He said the extent of the split within the Fed was not apparent from the statement it released immediately after its meeting on January 30, in which it reiterated its commitment the bond-buying programme. \"In contradiction to what the statement released after the meeting indicated, they suggest that a number of Fed officials might want to 'taper or end its purchases before it judged that a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labour market had occurred',\" he wrote in a note to clients. Dan Greenhaus, the chief global strategist at BTIG, said it was clear that most Fed members were still in favor of Fed policy, and that the Fed was \"reconciling the improving economic backdrop with their ongoing asset purchase programme.\" \"There is clearly support for asset purchases although the implementation is being debated.

Such criticism was vocalised by the future Archbishop of Canterbury who described the terms of some of their loans as \"usurious\" and its business model as \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9700796/Justin-Welby-the-Bishop-of-Durham-calls-for-cap-on-total-cost-of-payday-loans.html\" title=\"\">morally wrong</a>\".</p> <p>There are many who would consider MoneyLine's business model to be socially preferable.
