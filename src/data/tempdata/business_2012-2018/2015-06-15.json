    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s all for tonight, after a day that began with the EU and creditors blaming each other for the collapse of talks last night... ....followed by Tsipsas\u2019s claim that lenders were driven by \u201c\u201dpolitical purposefulness\u201d after years of looting.... ....which preceded Mario Draghi calling for a deal very soon... ...and reports of big withdrawals at Greek banks.... ...and ended up with those (denied) reports that capital controls could be forced on Greece this weekend. All punctuated by heavy losses on the stock markets. I\u2019m be back on Tuesday morning for another day of drama. Thanks, as ever, for reading and commenting. Goodnight! GW Alexis Tsipras\u2019s pledge early this morning to resist any more looting by its creditors makes the front page of tomorrow\u2019s FT: The Daily Telegraph reports that Greece could potentially ask the European Court of Justice to protect it..... Germany\u2019s Suddeutsche Zeitung reported that the creditors are drawing an ultimatum to the Greeks, threatening to cut off Greek access to the European payments system and forcing capital controls on the country as soon as this weekend. The plan would lead to the temporary closure of the banks, followed by a rationing of cash withdrawals. Syriza sources have told the Telegraph that Greece may seek an injunction from the European Court of Justice to stop the creditors and the EU institutions acting in a way that breaches Greek treaty rights. This would be an unprecedented move, greatly complicating the picture. The FT has a rather unsympathetic quote from one of Greece\u2019s creditors tonight: According to a copy of Greece\u2019s counter-proposal presented to Mr Juncker\u2019s staff at the weekend and obtained by the FT, Athens agreed to meet the creditors\u2019 demands on budget surplus targets for this year and next year. For 2015, Athens said it would reach a primary budget surplus of 1 per cent and 2 per cent in 2016 \u2014 something the Greek government has resisted for nearly two weeks. But officials representing Greek creditors said many of the underlying fiscal measures \u2014 particularly the \u20ac2.4bn in savings attributed to \u201cadministrative measures\u201d \u2014 were unlikely to be met, making the promise to achieve surplus levels meaningless. \u201cIt\u2019s like you saying you promise to lose 20 kilos by next June, but you keep eating the same amount of chocolate,\u201d said one senior official from one of Greece\u2019s bailout monitors. A spokesman for the German government has said he could not confirm or deny S\u00fcddeutsche\u2019s claim that eurozone governments are considering pushing Greece to implement capital controls, if there\u2019s no deal by the weekend. A Greek official has apparently denied that it could be bounced into implementing capital controls this weekend. A majority of Greeks blame creditors, not their leaders, for the long deadlock - according to a new poll just released. Top officials in Athens have roundly rejected claims made by EU officials that the Greek government agreed to measures which it then rowed back on, triggering the collapse in talks on Sunday. The version of events leaked by insiders close to EU commissioner, Jean-Claude Juncker, was not only misleading but very \u201ceconomical with the truth,\u201d a government source told the Guardian. \u201cWhat we said at a dinner [attended by] Juncker last week was that if the whole agreement, the package of reforms, was economically viable we, in turn, could move towards their fiscal targets for 2015 and 2016,\u201d said the official insisting that the leftist-led government never agreed to specifics such as how such targets would be met. \u201cWe never agreed to any of their baseline scenarios, or what would be done, or that we would reduce pensions and to leak that is very misleading,\u201d he added. \u201cYes, reports that we were late by an hour are true but the rest is being very economical with the truth.\u201d Government insiders refused to be drawn on when negotiations would resume saying: \u201cwe don\u2019t know when that will happen.\u201d \u201cIt is up to our European partners to decide whether, after six years of recession, the priority should be a strong reform programme to counter tax evasion, the power of the elites and the failings of the Greek public administration or yet more recessionary measures, yet more cuts in pensions and real wages,\u201d said one insider. \u201cIt is also time for a decision whether Europe can encompass a government and people that have set social and economic priorities somewhat different from the mainstream.\u201d The time had come, he said, to see whether pluralism, fairness and democracy \u201care still European values worth preserving.\u201d German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung is reporting tonight that European leaders are drawing up an emergency plan for Greece, including capital controls. They would be implemented, it claims, if a Greek deal was not agreed by the weekend. This would effectively be an ultimatum to Greece to accept creditors demands.... Time for another recap of this afternoon\u2019s developments. Brussels insiders have revealed that Greece\u2019s latest proposals were rebuffed on Sunday night without even being considered by its creditors, in a sign of how relations have deteriorated. Our Brussels editor Ian Traynor has learned that a team from the creditors spent all weekend waiting in vain for a proposal that was worth considering in detail. In the end, by Sunday evening, said Brussels officials, the talks were not only stalemated or at an impasse, but had actually suffered a reversal, with the Greeks trying to re-open issues that both sides had already agreed. More here. The collapse of talks prompted Greek savers to withdraw funds from their bank accounts again today; \u20ac400m was taken out, according to insiders. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, has urged both sides to work towards a strong agreement, which is now needed very soon. Testifying at the European Parliament, he told MEPs that: We need a strong, and comprehensive agreement with Greece. And we need it very soon.... While all actors will now need to go the extra mile, the ball lies squarely in the camp of the Greek government to take the necessary steps\u201d The Greek government, though, said it is waiting for an invitation from creditors, as both sides become entrenched. In a sometimes tetchy hearing, Draghi told MEPs that the ECB will keep providing funding for Greece\u2019s banks as long as they are solvent. He also rejected claims that the ECN is letting Greece down, pointing out that it has provided around \u20ac118bn of liquidity support. Draghi warned that a Greek default would be \u2018uncharted waters\u2019. And he also flagged up that Greece\u2019s institutions are concerned about its funding needs once its current bailout ends (one way or another). Member states must tackle this issue, he warned, in a signal to Europe\u2019s leaders to face reality. The crisis sent shares down across Europe today, driving the London market to a three month low. And our lunchtime summary explains how Athens and Brussels blamed each other for the collapse of talks, as one EU commissioner predicted a \u2018state of emergency\u2019 next month without a deal very soon. Back in Greece tonight, social security minister Dimitris Stratoulis says the cuts being demanded of Greece in pensions amount to \u20ac1.8bn -- the equivalent of a 20% drop in earnings for pensioners (our own Helena Smith reports) Stratoulis, a Syriza hardliner, added: \u201cThey are also demanding \u20ac1.8bn in revenues from increasing VAT. These measures are measures of annihilation and will lead to the enslavement of the Greek people. They are unacceptable and therefore to be rejected.\u201d \u201cThere are no high pensions. Pensions have already been cut by 50%, a new reduction would leader to even greater recession.\u201d However... EC spokeswoman Annika Briedthard firmly denied today that the creditors were demanding cuts to individual pensions. And for a deeper understanding of the issue, check out this post by our data blog, Alberto Nardelli: Video: Here\u2019s a few highlights from Mario Draghi\u2019s appearance at Europe\u2019s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee: Although Mario Draghi made some interesting points to MEPs, he \u201cfailed to ignite much hope in the Eurozone this afternoon\u201d about Greece. So says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex.com: Stating that the region needs a \u2018strong deal\u2019, Draghi failed to clarify how much progress has been made on such a solution, likely because there hasn\u2019t been any, whilst also refusing to speculate on the consequences of any potential Greek ECB repayment failures. The DAX has now effectively lost all of the ground it had made back across last Wednesday and Thursday, and looks like it could return to the 4 month lows it saw last Tuesday, especially with what is looking like it will be another damp squib of a Eurogroup meeting on the 18th. That photo of the \u201cCome home drachma, all is forgiven\u201d sign has prompted our correspondent, Helena Smith, to send another photo of the same patch of graffiti. It shows Tom, the resident Irishman of Plaka (the district beneath the ancient Acropolis), who painted the billboards standing with a can of local Greek brew: fix beer. Helena, who also lives in Plaka, explains: Tom, who is perhaps the most colourful character in Plaka - where he has lived for decades - believes he has come up with the best solution yet for Greece. \u201cWe all need to drink Fix beer to fix it,\u201d he tells passersby (of which there are many). The Irishman regularly paints the billboards that enclose the property on which he lives. The pithy observations accompanying his artwork often snapped by the gang of professional photographers who now roam the streets of Athens. A bad day in Europe\u2019s stock markets has ended with the FTSE 100 hitting its lowest level in over three months. And London got off pretty lightly compared to the rest of Europe - the Italian FTSE MIB slid almost 2.5%. And in Greece, the Athens market finished the day down 4.6%, with Piraeus Bank tumbling 12%. Mario Draghi concludes his appearance at the European Parliament\u2019s Economic and Monetary Affairs committee by reiterating that Europe needs a Greek deal very soon. Both parties are now being called to their capacity to find a compromise that yields...a strong agreement that generates growth with social fairness, with fiscal sustainability and addresses some potential financial stability issues. And lets not forget my earlier point to Mr Weizs\u00e4cker (about Greece\u2019s future funding needs), the ECB president adds. We need two elements. One that concerns the substance of the policy agreement, and one that addresses the financing issues. And that\u2019s the end of the hearing. The committee chair says he hopes everyone will heeds Draghi\u2019s wise words. Draghi smiles modestly (ish). Back to Brussels, where Mario Draghi is being asked whether more gender equality would help the eurozone economy. I completely, totally, agree with you, Draghi replies All evidence shows that where we have gender equality objectives, productivity is higher, labour participation is higher, aggregate demand is higher. This may not fall under a central bank governor\u2019s remit, he muses, but sometimes a central banker has to take a wider view. Between 2000 and 2005, he continues, the regulation on financial stability in some important jurisdictions was being destroyed. Then, we were not thinking that financial stability would fall into the jurisdictions of central banks, But with hindsight, wouldn\u2019t it have been better for central banks in those jurisdictions to have spoken up about financial stability, Draghi asks. So yes, on the issue of gender equality, Draghi \u201cfully agrees that we should have it in mind when we consider structural reforms\u201d and ways of stimulating the eurozone economy. Breaking away from Mario Draghi\u2019s testimony (which is being streamed here). Reuters is reporting that Greek savers have taken out around \u20ac400m today. Bankers said that the pace of withdrawals picked up from last week, after talks collapsed over the weekend, but it\u2019s not a bank run. One said: \u201cThere is worry but the outflows were rather contained, not as bad as feared in the context of a bad climate after negotiations hit an impasse. \u201cFor the system as a whole, Monday\u2019s outflow is estimated at around 400 million euros.\u201d In April, Greek banks lost \u20ac4.9bn of deposits, or around \u20ac163m per day (or \u20ac220m excluding weekends). Every withdrawal leaves Greece\u2019s banks even more dependent on the ECB\u2019s emergency liquidity support, and potentially needing a further injection this week. Asked about European integration, Draghi says it\u2019s more important to expend energy strengthening the eurozone rather than adding more members. Mario Draghi then makes an important point about the Greek crisis -- the International Monetary Fund believes that Greece needs further financing to cover its needs beyond June 30th (when the eurozone bailout expires). And this view is shared by other institutions, he adds. So the IMF cannot hand over its portion of Greece\u2019s bailout loans, worth around \u20ac16bn over the next year, without some breakthrough on this issue. Member states must give an answer.....It is not easy, but it is essential. [The eurozone, though, says it won\u2019t discuss a third bailout until the current programme is resolved]. German MEP Jakob von Weizs\u00e4cker asks Draghi what would happen if Greece fails to meet its repayments to creditors this summer? And what would it take to prompt the ECB to end the emergency liquidity it is providing? I don\u2019t want to speculate about possible missed payments, Draghi replies. We know from the Greek leaders that these comments will be made fully, and in a timely manner. And on the ELA, Draghi confirms that it would take a two-thirds majority at the governing council to veto an extension of emergency liquidity. Another MEP asks why the ECB is driving up asset prices by its QE scheme, thus helping the wealthy, but not doing more to help the poor in Greece. Whether we like it or not, banks and markets exist and are the only way of transmitting monetary policy, Draghi replies. And what\u2019s the biggest cause of poverty? Unemployment. Are you suggesting we should raise interest rates now, Draghi asks, rhetorically. And then he switches into Italian (his mother tongue, of course), to declare that the ECB is aware of the criticism over its polities, but it is doing its best. And if we fails, at least we tried. Another MEP asks Draghi why he won\u2019t include Greece in his QE stimulus programme. Why are you blackmailing Athens, at a time when millions are in poverty and many children cannot even access basic healthcare? We are simply following the rules, Draghi replies. We are not a political player. And the rules state that: The ECB can\u2019t buy the bonds of a eurozone government which is currently being reviewed by the International Monetary Fund It can\u2019t buy bonds below a certain credit rating (and Greece\u2019s ratings are only a few notches above default) There\u2019s a limit to the share of any eurozone government\u2019s debt the ECB can hold. Dramatic scenes in Brussels! Greek MEP Notis Marias challenges Draghi about the dire state of the Greek economy, and the unfolding humanitarian crisis. He wants the ECB to do more to help Greece, by assisting with its payments to the IMF. The situation in the Greek is dramatic, Draghi agrees. But the ECB cannot undertake any monetary financing. He then outlines that Greece has received \u20ac223bn of bilateral loans from Europe, plus the ECB\u2019s liquidity support (\u20ac118bn so far), plus the IMF loans, plus the debt haircuts in 2012 (a 53.5% cut in the face value of \u20ac200m of debt). I don\u2019t want to overplay the significance of these numbers, but the responsibility does not lie only with the institutions who have provided this help. At this point, Marias thumps the table and waves a document, which he claims shows Mario Draghi assisted with such financing when he was governor of the Bank of Italy. Draghi says he\u2019s not clear what this is about (me neither, sorry), but will discuss it afterwards. You must read the law and not speculate on an answer, shoots back Marias. MEPs are asking Draghi about how much contagion would be created in the eurozone if Greece doesn\u2019t get a deal with its creditors and defaults. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s productive to speculate about possible outcomes, Draghi replies. We would be entering into \u201cuncharted waters\u201d, but he believes policymakers have all the tools to manage the situation. It is quite clear that our union is an unfinished construction, he concludes. And we need a \u201cquantum leap\u201d to complete monetary union. The Greek government doesn\u2019t agree that the ball is in its court! Alexis Tsipras\u2019s office just released a statement, saying it is waiting to be invited back to the negotiating table: \u201cWe are awaiting the invitation of the institutions and we will respond, at any time, to resume the negotiations.\u201d Mario Draghi now turns to Greece, and defends the European Central Bank\u2019s handling of the crisis. We will continue to take our decisions with full independence, he vows. This rules-based approach is what is required from us. This is what we have been following, and will continue to follow. Our current liquidity support now totally \u20ac118bn, says Draghi. That\u2019s 66% of Greek GDP. The highest level of any eurozone country. We will support Greek banks for as long as they are solvent, and have enough collateral. But, we cannot raise the cap preventing Greek banks from buying more Greek government debt, until there are clear signs that the current ongoing review of its bailout will be successfully concluded (meaning the \u20ac7.2bn of bailout funds can be unlocked). Draghi adds: We need a strong, and comprehensive agreement with Greece. And we need it very soon. Such a \u201cstrong\u201d deal would generates growth, has social fairness, addresses competitiveness, and the remaining sources of financial instability. And Draghi concludes that Greece must now take new steps to break the deadlock. While all actors must go the extra mile, the ball lies firmly in the camp of the Greek government to take the necessary steps. Mario Draghi turns to the impact ECB\u2019s QE programme: A large-scale asset purchase programme is \u201cnot without risks\u201d, Draghi says, and we monitor them very closely. In particular, we manage credit risks by only buying assets of sufficient quality. And we also decided the government bond purchases will not be \u2018risk-shared\u2019 (ie, each central bank is on the hook for purchases of its own sovereign bonds). We see financial stability risks as relatively contained right now, Draghi continues. There are no signs of overheating in the eurozone housing market. And he then turns to the distributional impact of the QE\u2019s huge stimulus package, acknowledging that it results in changes in asset prices, and wealth gains for investors. (in other words, if you\u2019re rich enough to own shares or bonds, you benefit) But this lies at the heart of monetary policy. Interest rate changes always change the attractiveness of saving vs spending. In the long run, stimulus will help everyone, including those who are relatively poor or out of work, he argues. Draghi tells MEPs that the ECB won\u2019t be panicked by the recent volatility in the bond markets. We must keep a steady monetary course and firmly implement measures, including our asset purchase scheme, Draghi declares firmly, reiterating comments made at the ECB\u2019s press conference earlier this month. He reaffirms that the ECB will keep buying \u20ac60bn of assets each month until September 2016, and at any rate until inflation is back on target. After apologising for being late (please don\u2019t mention it, Mario), Draghi begins giving his statement to the committee: The latest economic indicators and survey data broadly confirm that the economic recovery is proceeding, at a moderate rate, he says. There are encouraging signs that private investment is picking up, he says, suggesting the recovery should broaden. Our monetary policy measures are working their way through to the real economy. And he confirms that the ECB expects inflation to remain low for some months, before rising towards its targets close to, but below, 2%. Mario Draghi will mainly be testifying on his new asset-purchase scheme, the QE programme which was announced in January. But he will \u201ccertainly\u201d give his view on the negotiations between Greece and its creditors, says the committee chairman, Roberto Gualtieri. Gualtieri says that those talks have reached a critical point. Mario Draghi has just arrived at the European Parliament, around 15 minutes late. Perhaps his working lunch with Jean-Claude Juncker overran..... The first link I provided may require a plug-in; if so, you could try watching on EbS instead The FT has also published details of Greece\u2019s latest proposals (which, as you now know, was swiftly rebuffed before actually reaching the Troika). They confirm that Athens did accept the creditors demand of a 1% budget surplus this year, but its method of getting there was inadequate (as explained at 12.41pm) European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is about to testify before the European Parliament\u2019s Economic and Monetary Affairs committee. It is being streamed live here. Over in Athens the political opposition has accused prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led government of attempting to take debt-stricken Greece back to the drachma. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: The breakdown of talks with creditors has unleashed a welter of criticism from the Syriza-led government\u2019s political foes, with the main opposition centre right New Democracy party accusing the radical leftists of wanting to remove Greece from the euro zone. Lashing out at the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, New Democracy\u2019s parliamentary spokesman, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said it was now clear that the academic-turned-politician \u201chas bankruptcy in the back of his mind.\u201d \u201cIt may be a very fine day for Mr Varoufakis but it not a fine day for the rest of Greeks who, even at this very last moment, want an honourable compromise with Europe and cannot imagine Greece outside the Eurozone,\u201d he told the radio station, Focus 103,6. \u201cIf the government chooses rupture [from Europe] it means a return to the drachma in conditions of absolute chaos with a loss of income of around 30 % and more impoverishment of the Greek people.\u201d Speaking to the leftist radio station stokokkino.gr earlier today, the Greek finance minister called the breakdown in talks \u201ca moment of clarity.\u201d \u201cToday is a very fine day,\u201d Varoufakis said, adding. \u201cFinally we have arrived at the moment of clarity, yesterday Greece said enough is enough, now the Europeans have to take decisions.\u201d Seen \u201cfrom a positive angle\u201d things were now crystal clear, Varoufakis insisted, adding that it was impossible to have \u201creal convergence\u201d with creditors if the focus of the discussions was only on fiscal adjustments and not debt restructuring. He told the station. \u201cIf there was no discussion of debt relief and only the fiscal [reforms] that they want, [we] can\u2019t move forward. Finally, we have arrived at the moment of clarity where the opposite side, and specifically, the German chancellor, has to take decisions.\u201d The finance minister\u2019s remarks earned this retort from Mitsotakis. \u201cMr Varoufakis is clearly picturesque and dangerous. Unfortunately, Mr Tsipras didn\u2019t have the \u2026 courage to sideline him.\u201d EU officials have signalled their utter disenchantment with the Greek negotiations, by supplying unusual detail on how a weekend of talks in Brussels actually amounted to no negotiations at all. Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, reports: On Saturday and Sunday, a team from the creditors, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund, waited in a separate room at the European Commission\u2019s headquarters, while Martin Selmayr, chief of staff to Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, assessed whether there was enough of a basis for negotiations to begin. In the end, by Sunday evening, said Brussels officials, the talks were not only stalemated or at an impasse, but had actually suffered a reversal, with the Greeks trying to re-open issues that both sides had already agreed. The creditors had been promised new Greek proposals from the team that rushed to Brussels on Saturday morning. According to the account in Brussels, they failed to produce a paper. There was nothing to negotiate and the Greeks were asked to produce new figures on their fiscal targets by 10pm on Saturday evening. They delivered by 11pm. The offer was viewed as inadequate. The troika of creditors kept to their separate room and failed to meet the aides to Alexis Tsipras. The Greeks were asked to return to the table on Sunday afternoon with a revised proposal. The 3pm deadline passed. At 4pm the Greeks arrived with their proposals. An informed official described what then took place. \u201cSelmayr asked \u2018are these the pages you sent today?\u2019 \u2018Yes\u2019, was the answer. \u2018Are the figures any different from yesterday?\u2019 \u2018No\u2019.\u201d The conclusion: \u2018There was no basis for discussion\u201d. The Sunday talks broke up after 45 minutes. The troika team never met the Greeks all weekend. [PS: this latest Greek proposals was published by Kathimerini this morning] Time for a recap, as we await Mario Draghi\u2019s appearance at the European Parliament this afternoon. The Greek government and the European Commission have blamed each other for the collapse of negotiations over its bailout programme last night, amid rising concern that Greece could soon run out of cash to service its debts. Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellardis told reporters in Athens that Greece will keep working towards a deal, but insisted that it will not accept fresh cuts: The Greek government has only one plan and that is to reach a deal..... We will not adopt measures which will cut pensions, raise the value added tax on basic goods or measures which exacerbate the vicious circle of austerity. While in Brussels, the EC criticised Greece for producing numbers that didn\u2019t \u201cadd up\u201d. Spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt said the package proposed by the institutions was substantial, valid and made full economic sense. \u201cThe proposals meet the needs of the Greek people, the Greek government, but also of the other 18 (euro zone) member states..... \u201cThe targets have already been significantly lowered... It\u2019s not a one-way street.\u201d The EC also denied that it is pushing for pensions to be cut, but does want the overall cost of the system to be lowered by 1% of GDP. Germany\u2019s EU Commissioner Guenther Oettinger has dramatically raised the tensions today, telling MPs in Germany that Freece Reuters reports: \u201cWe should work out an emergency plan because Greece would fall into a state of emergency,\u201d said Oettinger, the EU Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society who is also a senior member of Merkel\u2019s CDU in unusually strong comments. \u201cEnergy supplies, pay for police officials, medical supplies, and pharmaceutical products and much more\u201d needed to be ensured, he said. He noted that the EU has \u201cproven mechanisms\u201d that can help states to fulfil essential duties such as with police protection and healthcare. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras remains steadfastly opposed to compromise, telling a Greek newspaper that the days of allowing creditors to loot the country are over. Tsipras has been meeting with senior ministers today discuss the crisis. Greek government debt has slumped in value today, as traders see a higher danger that it will default on its loans. That drove the yield on Greek two-year bonds soaring to 29.6%, up from below 25% on Friday night. European stock markets have been hit hard by the crisis today too. The FTSE 100 has shed 70 points or 1.1%, to 6714 points - that\u2019s a three-month low. And there are steeper losses in other markets; Athens has slumped by over 5%. And there was no escape from the Greek crisis for Francois Hollande as he visited the Paris Air Show. France\u2019s president urged Greece to resume talks soon, in an attempt to get a deal before Greece\u2019s bailout expires on 30 June, when it also owes \u20ac1.5bn to the IMF. AFP has the details: \u201cThis message is for Greece,\u201d Hollande told reporters at the Paris Air Show. \u201cIt should not wait and should restart discussions with the institutions... Let\u2019s not waste time.\u201d I\u2019d recommend getting your lunch breaks in soon, gang Despite the deterioration in relations between the two sides, some analysts believe a deal will be reached in time. One is Salman Ahmed of Lombard Odier, the Swiss private bank, who reckons Greece\u2019s lenders can force Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government to make new concessions. Here\u2019s his take: \u201cThe Greek banking sector is now totally dependent on the ELA provided by the ECB, which gives the European authorities a very strong bargaining chip as any reduction of this support will very quickly push Greece towards capital controls and extended bank holidays, which in turn will make the ruling Greek government very unpopular. \u201cWe expect noise on the Greek front to continue over the short-term (or even escalate), but expect a deal of some form to happen before the end of the month, given how damaging the alternative is for both sides.\u201d Greek newspaper Kathimerini has now published Greece\u2019s latest offer to its lenders, which was rejected last night. And it shows that Greece proposed imposing a special windfall tax on corporate profits over \u20ac1m, and also hiking corporate income tax from 26% to 29%, to claw in additional revenue. The report also confirms that Greece proposed just \u20ac71m of pension savings next year (and nothing this year); that\u2019s the 0.04% of GDP figure which the Commission cited as inadequate this morning. And Greece also refused to abolish its lowest VAT rate, as lenders want. Instead, it would actually cut that entry-level rate from 6.5% to 6%, for medicine, books, and theatres. Despite that, Athens still reckons it can bring in \u20ac680m of extra funds this year, and \u20ac1.36bn in 2016, by VAT reforms. The eight-page list also included cuts to defence spending, new taxes on TV adverts and new luxury taxes on private boats and yachts. Together, the measures show Greece hitting the primary surplus targets set by creditors, of 1% of GDP this year and 2% in 2016. Here\u2019s Kathimerini\u2019s report (in Greek). And here\u2019s a PDF of the Greek proposal (in English) Over in Athens there\u2019s been fighting talk this morning from the man who leads the government\u2019s junior partner, the stridently anti-austerian right wing populist Independent Greeks party. Helena Smith reports: Speaking to state-run TV this morning, the defence minister Panos Kammenos, who also heads the government\u2019s coalition partner, Anel, dug in his heels. According to Kammenos, Greece\u2019s foreign lenders must choose whether \u201cthey want a solution\u201d or whether they want \u201cto impoverish and humiliate a country.\u201d \u201cThe position of Greece and the Greek government is clear. For so many years Greeks have been forced to endure misery because of the failed policies that lenders imposed. These policies aren\u2019t going to continue, we are not going to surrender democracy, nor our parents, the Greek men and women pensioners who are now living under the poverty line. We have made a huge effort to find a solution. It is now up to them.\u201d Kammenos, whose popularity ratings like that of the governing radical left Syriza party have also improved since elections in January, insisted that the government didn\u2019t have the mandate \u201cto surrender either our national sovereignty or the dignity of the country and that is what we are going to stick by.\u201d Jean-Claude Juncker has invited Mario Draghi to a working lunch today, before Draghi\u2019s appearance at the European Parliament this afternoon. They plan to discuss the Four President\u2019s report on strengthening the eurozone, rather than the Greek crisis, the Commission says. Is there time to conclude the Greek programme by the end of June if eurozone ministers don\u2019t reach an agreement at their eurogroup meeting on Thursday? The only deadline is the 30 June when the Greek bailout programme expires, Schinas replies. Thursday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting would have been a good opportunity to assess any progress made over the weekend. Earlier today, EU Commissioner Guenther Oettinger warned that Greece will face a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d unless it has a bailout deal by the end of June. What plans is the EC taking to handle this? EC spokesman Margaritis Schinas says that the Commission is very busy negotiating an agreement. Over in Brussels, the European Commission is holding its own press briefing and defending its position. Spokeswoman Annika Briedthardt is explaining that the Institutions have already significantly lowered their budget targets in recent months, down from a surplus of 3.5% of GDP to 1%. It is up to the Greek government to make fresh proposals, she says, saying negotiations are not a \u201cone-way street\u201d. We want the numbers to add up.... According to Briedthardt, Greece\u2019s pensions reforms only added up to 0.04% of GDP, not the 1% that its lenders are looking for. She also firmly denies that that creditors are demanding that individual pensions are cut. Some more highlights from Greek government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis\u2019s briefing: The Greek government press briefing is being broadcast live here (no English translation, though). Gabriel Sakellaridis also blamed Greece\u2019s creditors for the collapse in talks last night, saying they didn\u2019t actually have a mandate to negotiate with them. That echoes what the top negotiator, Euclid Tsakalotos, told my colleague Helena Smith last night. Greece\u2019s main government spokesman, Gabriel Sakellaridis, is fielding questions in Athens now. Sakellaridis is insisting that Greece will keep working towards a deal, but on its terms rather than accepting the pension cuts, VAT rises and tougher budget surplus targets its lenders demand (reminder, there is a \u20ac2bn gap between the two sides). Sakellaridis also denied that Greece might be forced to call early elections -- we have a mandate to govern until 2019, he says. Reuters has snapped the key points: GREEK GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SAYS WE WILL CONTINUE EFFORTS TO REACH A DEAL GREEK GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SAYS OUR PARTNERS DON\u2019T WANT DEBT RESTRUCTURING BUT A CONTINUATION OF AUSTERITY GREEK GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SAYS GREEK GOVERNMENT\u2019S ONLY PLAN AT THE MOMENT IS TO REACH A DEAL GREEK GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN, ASKED ABOUT EARLY ELECTIONS, SAYS THIS GOVT HAS A MANDATE TO RULE FOR FOUR-YEAR TERM GREEK GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SAYS SCENARIOS FOR ELECTIONS OR REFERENDUM ARE NOT ON THE TABLE The president of Portugal, An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva, has also urged Greece and her creditors to resume talks quickly, echoing Francois Hollande\u2019s concern. But he is also unwilling to see Greece cut much slack. SOFIA - PORTUGAL PRESIDENT SAYS AGREEMENT BETWEEN GREECE AND TROIKA SHOULD BE REACHED AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, THIS WEEK IF POSSIBLE PORTUGAL PRESIDENT SAYS THERE ARE RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR ALL AND EXCEPTIONS COULD NOT BE MADE FOR ANY COUNTRY Germany isn\u2019t buckling this morning -- the Berlin government says they want Greece to stay in the single currency, but Athens must offer new proposals first. 10:31:30: GERMAN GOVT SPOKESMAN SAYS GERMAN GOVT WANTS GREECE TO STAY IN THE EURO ZONE 10:33:55: GERMAN FINMIN SPOKESMAN SAYS BALL IS IN GREECE\u2019S COURT French president Francois Hollande warned reporters at the Paris Air Show that Europe will suffer turbulence unless Greece and her creditors reach a deal. I\u2019ve taken the quotes from Reuters: \u201cWe are arriving at a time that could be turbulent if we don\u2019t reach an agreement.... Let us not waste time and let\u2019s restart the negotiations as soon as possible.\u201d Newsflash from Greece: The government\u2019s top ministers have begun holding an emergency meeting (earlier than we thought....) France\u2019s president, Francois Hollande, has urged Greece and its institutions to resume talks as soon as possible. I think he was speaking at the Paris Air Show. Greek banks appear to be working normally today: I know you\u2019re all heard this before, but it really is a crunch week for Greece. Its existing bailout programme expires on 30 June; if there\u2019s not a deal by then, Greece will lose \u20ac7.2bn of outstanding loans which have been frozen for months. The best, possibly last chance of a deal to unfreeze those funds comes in three days time when eurozone finance ministers meet. And Europe\u2019s stock markets will be \u201cdriven by the saga\u201d, says Peter Rosenstreich, Head of Market Strategy at online bank Swissquote: The deadline is approaching fast (end of June) and the Eurogroup meeting on Thursday is broadly seen as the last chance for Greece to reach an agreement that will unlock the remaining \u20ac7.2bn bailout fund. In spite of last week\u2019s highly uncertain environment, markets remained relatively stable with most market participants consolidating their positions. However, we expect markets will feel the heat this week as the odds of a Greek default have increased considerably. Jens Weidmann, the head of Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, has just warned that time is running out for Greece, Reuters reports. Weidmann was giving a speech in Frankfurt this morning, and warning that central bank policy can\u2019t do everything. BUNDESBANK CHIEF WEIDMANN SAYS MORE EXPANSIONARY MONETARY POLICY WOULD NOT ADDRESS FACTORS THAT ARE DRAGGING ON GROWTH BUNDESBANK CHIEF WEIDMANN SAYS HIGH PUBLIC DEBT AND RESULTING TAX BURDEN COULD DAMPEN GROWTH IN EURO ZONE WEIDMANN SAYS MONETARY POLICY CAN MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO RETURNING TO SUSTAINABLE AND SOLID GROWTH Greek media are reporting that Alexis Tsipras will meet his bailout negotiating team this afternoon, around noon BST. The selloff in Greek government debt is intensifying too: The Athens stock market has now hit its lowest point since late April, as bank shares drag it down: The Greek stock market has tanked by over 6% in a panicky rush of sell orders, as trading begins in Athens. Banking shares have slumped by over 12%, hit by fears that the Greek government could default. Greek banks are already heavily reliant on the emergency liquidity provided by the European Central Bank. It will decide on Wednesday whether to maintain that support. Alexis Tsipras is implacable that Athens will not cave in to creditors\u2019 demands. In a defiant statement to the Ton Syntakton newspaper, the Greek prime minister said his government will wait \u201cpatiently\u201d until lenders become realistic. Tsipras told the paper that he would not surrender his democratic mandate, having won power in January on a pledge to end the \u201cvicious cycle of austerity\u201d. \u201cOne can only see a political purposefulness in the insistence of creditors on new cuts in pensions after five years of looting under the bailouts.\u201d \u201cWe will await patiently until the institutions accede to realism,. We do not have the right to bury European democracy at the place where it was born.\u201d The unfolding Greek crisis has sent shares sliding in London, Paris, Amsterdam, Milan, Madrid and Frankfurt: Ian Williams of Peel Hunt explains: The tone of the reports over the weekend suggested that the other European leaders are losing patience with Greece and news that the implications of a default are under serious discussion does not suggest hopes for a compromise are high. European markets are falling in early trading as fears that Greece could soon default on its loans sweep the trading floors. As feared, the German DAX fell 1.3% at the start of trading in Frankfurt, followed by France\u2019s CAC (down 1.1%). In London, the FTSE 100 is down 35 points, or 0.5%, at 6750 as investors react to the collapse of talks on Sunday evening. The parliamentary leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) has urged Greece to \u201cget back to reality\u201d this morning, showing that tensions in Berlin are rattling up. Volker Kauder also warned that the Bundestag will refuse to back a Greek aid package unless the IMF is fully involved: Kauder told the ARD TV station: \u201cI couldn\u2019t vote for a further payment if the IMF says it won\u2019t work...We\u2019re pleased that the IMF is with us but if it says it won\u2019t work then our parliamentary group will also say we can\u2019t pay out further (loan) tranches.\u201d \u201cWe all know what\u2019s at stake. No one else in Europe is carrying the responsibility for this except Greece itself. \u201cNot only Angela Merkel (wants to keep Greece in the euro), a lot of people want that....We\u2019re saying Greece should remain. But it won\u2019t work that Greece sets the terms and says \u2018everyone else has to dance to our tune\u2019. Greece needs to get back to reality.\u201d (quotes via Reuters) And here\u2019s another sign of alarm: EURO/DOLLAR 1-MONTH IMPLIED VOLATILITY RISES TO 3-1/2 YEAR HIGH OF 14.305%, TRADERS CITE GREEK WORRIES That means investors are paying more to protect themselves against sharp swings in the value of the euro in the weeks ahead. Money is flowing into German bonds and out of Italian, Spanish and (of course) Greek debt this morning. That has pushed the yield (or interest rate) on German 10-year bunds down to 0.8%, from 0.85% on Friday night. The yield on two-year Greek bonds has risen to 26%, from 25.86% on Friday night, showing it\u2019s seen as even riskier this morning. Stock market traders in Frankfurt may be reaching for the tin hats. The German DAX is tipped to fall by around 150 points, or 1.3%, when trading begins in around 20 minutes time. Other markets are also expected to lose more ground, extending last week\u2019s losses: Chris Weston of IG says there is \u201ca modest degree of concern\u201d about Greece. The Greek negotiating team are still optimistically pushing for continued inclusion in the Monetary Union, while at the same time pushing for debt forgiveness and maintaining government. This is simply not going to happen but it is important to note that both the Greeks and the Creditor nations have common ground, in so much that they are both agreeing on a 3.5% primary surplus by 2018. It\u2019s the pace and how they get there in the years leading into this that are a major point of contention. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek bailout negotiations and other key events across the world economy, the financial market and business. Fears of a Greek default are rising this morning after last-ditch talks between Athens and its creditors collapsed on Sunday night. A meeting between the two sides broke up after under an hour, with negotiators unable to reach any agreement on pension reforms, budget targets and tax rates. That has dashed lingering hopes that eurozone finance ministers could rubber-stamp a deal when they meet on Thursday. Instead, Greece is careering towards the end of June, when its bailout programme expires and it owes around \u20ac1.6bn to the International Monetary Fund. EU insiders dismissed the Greek plans as \u201cincomplete\u201d, while Greece\u2019s top negotiator Euclid Tsakalotos blamed the creditors for failing to compromise. Tsakalotos told us: \u201cWe made huge efforts to meet them halfway but they insisted on both pension cuts and the increase in VAT on restaurants and would not accept closing the gap even partially via administrative measures to reduce tax evasion, even though this was a central plank of our electoral programme. Moreover, they told us bluntly they had no mandate to discuss a compromise! So much for negotiating... Here\u2019s Helena Smith full story: It tees up another \u201ccrunch week for Greece\u201d, with Thursday\u2019s eurogroup meeting likely to be extremely tense. We\u2019ll hear from the Greek government shortly, and then from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi this afternon, when he appears at the European Parliament from 3pm Brussels time (2pm BST) Even as the talks were collapsing, the IMF was launching a blogpost by the IMF\u2019s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, which explained that a \u201ccredible\u201d deal must include some debt relief for Greece. Blanchard wrote: On the one hand, the Greek government has to offer truly credible measures to reach the lower target budget surplus, and it has to show its commitment to the more limited set of reforms. We believe that even the lower new target cannot be credibly achieved without a comprehensive reform of the VAT \u2013 involving a widening of its base \u2013 and a further adjustment of pensions. Why insist on pensions? Pensions and wages account for about 75% of primary spending; the other 25% have already been cut to the bone. Pension expenditures account for over 16% of GDP, and transfers from the budget to the pension system are close to 10% of GDP. We believe a reduction of pension expenditures of 1% of GDP (out of 16%) is needed, and that it can be done while protecting the poorest pensioners. We are open to alternative ways for designing both the VAT and the pension reforms, but these alternatives have to add up and deliver the required fiscal adjustment. On the other hand, the European creditors would have to agree to significant additional financing, and to debt relief sufficient to maintain debt sustainability. We believe that, under the existing proposal, debt relief can be achieved through a long rescheduling of debt payments at low interest rates. Any further decrease in the primary surplus target, now or later, would probably require, however, haircuts. But some Greek politicians won\u2019t settle for mere debt haircuts. According to Ambrose Evans-Pritchard in the Telegraph today: The radical wing of Greece\u2019s Syriza party is to table plans over coming days for an Icelandic-style default and a nationalisation of the Greek banking system. Syriza sources say measures being drafted include capital controls and the establishment of a sovereign central bank able to stand behind a new financial system. While some form of dual currency might be possible in theory, such a structure would be incompatible with euro membership and would imply a rapid return to the drachma. The confidential plans were circulating over the weekend and have the backing of 30 MPs from the Aristeri Platforma or \u2018Left Platform\u2019, as well as other hard-line groupings in Syriza\u2019s spectrum. It is understood that the nationalist ANEL party in the ruling coalition is also willing to force a rupture with creditors, if need be. With one Syriza MP vowing not to be \u201cthrottled to death by European monetary union,\u201d it\u2019s going to be another dramatic week....",

According to the account in Brussels, they failed to produce a paper. There was nothing to negotiate and the Greeks were asked to produce new figures on their fiscal targets by 10pm on Saturday evening. They delivered by 11pm. The offer was viewed as inadequate. The troika of creditors kept to their separate room and failed to meet the aides to Alexis Tsipras.</p> <p> The Greeks were asked to return to the table on Sunday afternoon with a revised proposal. The 3pm deadline passed. At 4pm the Greeks arrived with their proposals. An informed official described what then took place.</p> <p>\u201cSelmayr asked \u2018are these the pages you sent today?\u2019 \u2018Yes\u2019, was the answer. \u2018Are the figures any different from yesterday?\u2019 \u2018No\u2019.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The conclusion: \u2018There was no basis for discussion\u201d.

We believe that even the lower new target cannot be credibly achieved without a comprehensive reform of the VAT \u2013 involving a widening of its base \u2013 and a further adjustment of pensions. Why insist on pensions? Pensions and wages account for about 75% of primary spending; the other 25% have already been cut to the bone. Pension expenditures account for over 16% of GDP, and transfers from the budget to the pension system are close to 10% of GDP. We believe a reduction of pension expenditures of 1% of GDP (out of 16%) is needed, and that it can be done while protecting the poorest pensioners. We are open to alternative ways for designing both the VAT and the pension reforms, but these alternatives have to add up and deliver the required fiscal adjustment.</p> <p>On the other hand, the European creditors would have to agree to significant additional financing, and to debt relief sufficient to maintain debt sustainability.

Past Greek crises always seemed likely to end in a deal, and did. This time, even at the 11th hour, red lines are turning scarlet. Given that backdrop, the reaction of financial markets was remarkably sanguine. Greek stocks, especially banks, were clobbered, obviously. But the wider reaction was mild. Yields on the debt of eurozone stragglers rose but are well below levels seen in 2011-12. Stock markets outside Greece were down but not heavily. It suggests one of two things. Either investors still believe a deal will come, or they think Greece is too small to matter. The former should be known by the end of the week. But the idea that the Greek crisis is not terribly important for markets looks wildly wrong. The up-front financial damage from a Greek default would be real to the lenders, causing a who-knows-what response in elections everywhere from Spain to Finland to Germany. A go-it-alone Greece could descend into economic collapse, forcing Berlin and Brussels to act to avoid interference from Moscow. Equally, if Greece were to abandon the euro and prosper in time, the single currency\u2019s unity would be in doubt. The view from US politicians and financial figures tends to be astonishment that Greece has not been cut more slack. They\u2019re right to worry: it\u2019s impossible to know precisely which problems default would bring, but all look serious. Good governance, bad way of telling us Wouldn\u2019t it be useful to be able to invest only in companies that are governed well?

The other is a ranking based on criteria that are supposedly more objective \u2013 companies are scored on 53 factors. If the purpose of running two rankings was to illustrate that perceptions and reality can be miles apart, it succeeds. Barclays, for example, is perceived as being poorly governed but the bank is near the top of the pile on the analytical basis. So ignore the subjective views and stick to the more rigorous stuff? You\u2019d think that would be the conclusion, but it\u2019s not what the IoD suggests. It proposes blending the two methods. It\u2019s not clear why. Ken Olisa, an IoD director who had an unhappy spell at governance-challenged miner ENRC, calls the approach \u201cnovel\u201d but it can also be seen as arbitrary. Or, perhaps, it may be an implicit admission that judging good governance involves more art than science. Some wrong \u2019uns can be easy to spot. ENRC was obviously so, even before Olisa branded the company \u201cmore Soviet than City\u201d on his resignation. But companies in the middle will always be trickier. Would the IoD\u2019s index have weeded out the rotten banks, circa 2007, or Tesco, before its accounting scandal? If the IoD could answer yes, and provide the statistical evidence, we\u2019d be all ears.

      "bodyText": "JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, faces embarrassment after it emerged that the bank\u2019s fund management arm takes investor voting advice from a firm at the centre of his attacks on \u201clazy\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d shareholders. Advice from Institutional Shareholder Services is regularly taken by JP Morgan Asset Management, which looks after $1.7trn (\u00a31.1tn) of investments for clients, the investment division confirmed. Its recommendations are only overridden in a \u201clow number\u201d of cases. The admission, made after JPMAM\u2019s voting history was leaked to Responsible Investor magazine, comes less than three weeks after Dimon\u2019s outburst. Speaking to an investor conference in New York, the investment bank boss said: \u201cGod knows how any of you can place your vote based on ISS or Glass Lewis [a competitor advisory firm]. If you do that you, are just irresponsible, I am sorry. And, you probably aren\u2019t a very good investor, either. I know some of you here do it because you are lazy.\u201d His bad-tempered remarks were made in the wake of JP Morgan\u2019s annual shareholder meeting a week earlier in Detroit, where Dimon faced heavy criticism of his own pay arrangements. Many shareholders had been moved to vote against his pay at the meeting, in part on advice from ISS. Leaked JPMAM voting records, shown to Responsible Investor, revealed votes against boardroom pay arrangements at five international companies during the first three months of the year \u2014 in each case, in line with advice from ISS. The five companies were Swiss specialist piping supplier Georg Fisher, US drug firm Arrowhead Research, South Korea\u2019s Lotte Chemical, French caravan maker Trigano and Chinese glassmaker Xinyi Glass. Many controversial votes over pay and governance issues are reviewed by Robert Hardy, head of corporate governance for JPMAM in Europe. But his team of three are responsible for votes at about 5,000 meetings each year, making it useful to draw on the recommendations of so-called proxy voting agencies such as ISS in many instances. Hardy said: \u201cThe industry as a whole has gravitated to the use of proxy voting agencies for a reason. They are a cost-effective and efficient means of collating and assessing large amounts of voting information in a timely and consistent way, and to enable us to focus on names and issues which have material impacts on our clients.\u201d A JPMAM spokesman said: \u201cWe are not against proxy advisors. Jamie\u2019s point is that you should use them for advice \u2013 but not automatically outsource your vote to them.\u201d H ardy said that, so far this year, JPMAM had overridden advice from ISS on \u201ca relatively low number\u201d of votes. Hardy suggested this was largely because JPMAM\u2019s own corporate governance policy was based on the same best practice prinicples as ISS guidelines. Three years ago, JPMAM had written to European regulators in support of the role played by proxy advisers. \u201cThe evidence clearly suggests that the major proxy voting agencies have an important role in modern cross-border voting activity, and have the potential to influence voting outcomes,\u201d wrote JPMAM. \u201cWhilst institutional asset managers should not absolve themselves of their duty to their clients by outsourcing their proxy voting activity, it is absolutely appropriate that companies \u2026 should be encouraged by their owners to aspire to international governance principles and greater standards of corporate governance, and it is our view that proxy advisors play a key role in helping to facilitate this.\u201d JPMAM told regulators it had overridden ISS recommendations on 834 votes in 2011, or 4.3% of the time. So far this year, the fund manager said it had overridden ISS on 82 occasions. Last month 38.1% of votes at JPMorgan\u2019s annual meeting failed to support a controversial $20m pay deal for Dimon, including $7.4m in cash. Dimon\u2019s 2014 pay award was made despite JP Morgan paying about $1bn in penalties to regulators to settle foreign exchange rigging allegations during the year. ISS\u2019s objection to his pay, however, had concerned the large cash bonus component, described as having been granted \u201cwithout compelling rationale\u201d. JP Morgan\u2019s senior non-executive and chair of the executive compensation committee, Lee Raymond, had told last month\u2019s investor meeting that directors \u201cacknowledge the importance of the question\u201d being raised over Dimon\u2019s pay and promised to review the arrangements. Raymond himself was among America\u2019s best-paid boardroom bosses before he retired as chief executive of Exxon 10 years ago. The issue of pay is not the first over which Dimon has crossed swords with ISS. In 2013 Dimon had resisted shareholder efforts to strip him of the role of chairman, which he holds in addition to his position as JP Morgan chief executive. Efforts to award the chairmanship to an independent board member were defeated, despite support from ISS.",

    "webTitle": "Greece talks must yield imminent agreement, says European Central Bank", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has warned that time is rapidly running out to resolve the Greek debt crisis, as financial markets took fright at the prospect of a looming default. Shares fell across Europe after the latest breakdown in talks between Athens and its creditors diminished hopes of a deal being agreed at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Luxembourg on Thursday. Giving evidence to the European parliament in Brussels, Draghi said: \u201cWe need a strong and comprehensive agreement with Greece. And we need it very soon.\u201d His remarks came amid evidence of the fragile state of Greece\u2019s banks, where the pace of deposit withdrawals increased to \u20ac400m (\u00a3289m) on Monday. Capital flight is making Greece more dependent on emergency funding from the ECB but Draghi hinted that there would be no immediate loss of support from Frankfurt, despite the souring of the relationship between Athens and its creditors. \u201cWhile all actors will now need to go the extra mile, the ball lies squarely in the camp of the Greek government to take the necessary steps,\u201d Draghi said. Alexis Tspiras, Greece\u2019s prime minister, showed no sign of giving in to demands to make the state pension less generous, raise VAT or water down his government\u2019s plans to reform labour laws in favour of workers. \u201cWe will await patiently until the institutions accede to realism,\u201d Tsipras told the Greek newspaper Efimerida ton Syntakton. \u201cWe do not have the right to bury European democracy at the place where it was born.\u201d He blamed \u201cpolitical expediency\u201d on the part of lenders for the impasse and their insistence on new cuts in pensions \u201cafter five years of looting under the bailouts\u201d. The stance adopted by Tsipras infuriated officials at the European Commission in Brussels, who took the unusual step of releasing details of how an attempt to revive talks on Sunday broke down in less than an hour. The \u201clast-chance\u201d negotiations represented a worsening of the situation as the Greeks sought to reopen issues already agreed upon, EU officials said on Monday. Signalling disenchantment with the Greek negotiations, the officials voiced deep pessimism that a deal can be struck. \u201cWe are ready to convene at very short notice. The only condition is that something serious is on the table that makes discussions productive. That has not been possible,\u201d said an official briefed on the events of the past three days. Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis said he is not planning to present new reform proposals at a meeting of the eurogroup committee of eurozone finance ministers later this week, according to excerpts from a German newspaper interview published on Tuesday. Asked if he would present such a list, Varoufakis was quoted as saying: \u201cNo, because the eurogroup is not the right place to present proposals which haven\u2019t been discussed and negotiated on a lower level before.\u201d However, the Greek negotiation team is \u201cavailable at any time\u201d to find a comprehensive solution with its partners, Varoufakis said, adding that officials from the three institutions representing Greece\u2019s lenders needed to come back to the negotiation table \u201cwith a clear, robust mandate\u201d. Varoufakis repeated his call to German chancellor Angela Merkel to give his country a \u201cspeech of hope\u201d, to signal Europe was ready to end its demands for austerity, similar to that given to Germany at the end of the second world war. The meeting of the eurogroup committee of eurozone finance ministers in Luxembourg is seen as yet another last chance to reach a deal before Greece\u2019s current bailout package expires at the end of the month. Athens must pay \u20ac1.6bn to the International Monetary Fund by 30 June and requires the release of a further \u20ac7.2bn in bailout funds in order to meet the payment. In return, Greece\u2019s creditors \u2013 the ECB, European commission and the IMF \u2013 are demanding economic reforms. Responding to Tsipras\u2019s statement that he would patiently wait for a call to resume talks, an EU official responded: \u201cHe may not have time for patience.\u201d As Brussels considers how to cope with a Greek default, Berlin is said to be particularly exercised about the risks of social breakdown in Greece. Unnamed German government sources told Munich\u2019s S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung that an emergency summit on Greece could be convened in Brussels as early as Friday if the eurozone finance ministers fail to make a breakthrough on Thursday in Luxembourg. The German sources warned of Greek banks being closed down and capital controls imposed over the weekend. Sources in Brussels last night denied there were any plans for an emergency summit this week. \u201cNothing planned. Nothing decided. All eyes on Eurogroup,\u201d said an official in Brussels. \u201cWe should work out an emergency plan because Greece would fall into a state of emergency,\u201d said Germany\u2019s European commissioner, Guenther Oettinger. \u201cEnergy supplies, pay for police officials, medical supplies, and pharmaceutical products and much more\u201d needed to be ensured, he said. Athens\u2019s benchmark ATG equity index fell 4.7% on Monday, with the Athens stock exchange FTSE Banks Index down 8%. National Bank of Greece fell 5.7% and Bank of Piraeus dropped 12.2%. Other European bourses were affected by the gloomy mood. The key German and French share indices were down almost 2%, while the Italian index lost 2.5%. In London, the FTSE 100 closed at its lowest level in three months, dropping 74 points or 1.1% to close at 6710.52.",

In Athens, tourists out for an early look at the Parthenon find they can no longer get euros out of the cash machines. Contingency plans have been triggered to prevent a run on the banks. Strict capital controls are in force. As late as the middle of last week, this all seemed a bit fanciful. Officials in Brussels were briefing that a breakthrough was close.

The IMF called its negotiating team home from Brussels last week because the talks were going nowhere. Attempts to get them going again were abandoned on Sunday after less than an hour. The rhetoric has become angrier and angrier as positions have hardened. Normally, the choreography that precedes a euro fudge would see the two sides edging closer together. The officials that prepare the ground for a deal would be piecing together 90% of the final agreement, leaving ministers the other 10% to haggle over on Thursday. That does not appear to be happening, which is why both sides are preparing for a default. Can it be prevented? Yes, but it would either require the troika to moderate their key demands on pensions, tax and labour market reform, or for Tsipras to cross his red lines on the same issues. Neither looks likely.",

      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook is to launch a joint venture in China, as the tour operator seeks to capitalise on a tourism boom in one of the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The Chinese recently overtook Americans as the world\u2019s biggest-spending tourists, splashing out $165bn (\u00a3106bn) in 2014, with more than 100 million people travelling abroad. Hong Kong and Macau remain the biggest holiday destinations for Chinese tourists, but Europe is popular among an affluent minority. In a bid to profit from that growing wanderlust, one of the world\u2019s oldest travel firms has unveiled a joint venture with Fosun International, one of China\u2019s largest conglomerates. Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, described the deal as a significant milestone. Thomas Cook said the joint venture would marry its \u201cbrand heritage and expertise in international travel\u201d with Fosun\u2019s \u201clocal market knowledge and operation resources\u201d. The two firms are putting in a combined \u00a31.6m to launch the venture, which will also sell internal tours. Thomas Cook, which began life in 1841 by selling rail excursions to a temperance rally in Loughborough, has been trying to reinvent its business for the internet age after it almost collapsed in 2012 following a slump in bookings. The firm hopes that the deal will allow it to develop upmarket hotels in China, which will be exclusive to Thomas Cook customers. Fosun, which was founded by four university graduates in Shanghai in 1992, is one of China\u2019s largest conglomerates, with interests spanning banking, pharmaceuticals and mining. In March, Fosun paid \u00a392m for a 5% stake in Thomas Cook, raising speculation of an eventual takeover. Fosun also bought the ailing French holiday company Club Med in February, having acquired a 7% stake in 2010. The joint venture could bring a wider range of holidays to China\u2019s burgeoning middle class. \u201cToday there is a lack of innovation and differentiation in the travel product offerings for Chinese tourists in China and abroad, presenting an excellent opportunity for our new joint venture to gain a competitive advantage,\u201d said Qian Jiannong, president of Fosun\u2019s tourism and commercial group. Wolfgang Georg Arlt, director of the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute, agreed there was \u201ctoo much run-of-the-mill stuff\u201d for Chinese tourists. He said that a second wave of Chinese tourists \u2013 younger, well educated and more likely to work for international companies \u2013 wanted bespoke holidays. \u201cThey are less interested in ticking off a list of famous places and more interested in doing things\u201d \u2013 such as learning local dances, taking cookery classes or going punting in Cambridge. But the \u201cfive countries in 10 days\u201d coach tours most associated with Chinese tourists in Europe are likely to remain popular. Stefanie Gallob, head of research at the European Travel Commission, said more Chinese tourists were travelling independently, but the market was likely to remain dominated by group travel for the medium term, because it was easier to obtain travel documents from Chinese authorities. \u201cIt is not a free travel market \u2013 it is a highly regulated and centralised market.\u201d France was named as the top \u201cdream destination\u201d in a survey of outbound Chinese tourists conducted by China Confidential, a research arm of the Financial Times. Italy was in second place, followed by the UK and Germany, although the top five countries actually visited were all in Asia. The UK, which is outside the EU\u2019s Schengen area of passport-free travel, attracts barely one-third of the tourists who went to France: between January and September 2014, 619,294 Chinese tourists visited France, but only 239,967 went to the UK, fewer than went to Switzerland, Germany or Russia. Last year, George Osborne announced that 25,000 Chinese tourists visiting the UK in organised groups could get their visa costs refunded, as the government seeks to entice more high-spending holidaymakers to visit Britain. Bicester\u2019s retail village, in Oxfordshire, is among the most popular UK destinations for Chinese tourists. The ETC said it had not yet seen any change in Chinese tourists\u2019 holiday intentions since the changes were announced.",

He said that a second wave of Chinese tourists \u2013 younger, well educated and more likely to work for international companies \u2013 wanted bespoke holidays. \u201cThey are less interested in ticking off a list of famous places and more interested in doing things\u201d \u2013 such as learning local dances, taking cookery classes or going punting in Cambridge.</p> <p>But the \u201cfive countries in 10 days\u201d coach tours most associated with Chinese tourists in Europe are likely to remain popular. Stefanie Gallob, head of research at the European Travel Commission, said more Chinese tourists were travelling independently, but the market was likely to remain dominated by group travel for the medium term, because it was easier to obtain travel documents from Chinese authorities. \u201cIt is not a free travel market \u2013 it is a highly regulated and centralised market.\u201d</p> <p>France was named as the top \u201cdream destination\u201d in a <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5ce95ca6-1326-11e5-ad26-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3d7XrFVR5\">survey of outbound Chinese tourists</a> conducted by China Confidential, a research arm of the Financial Times. Italy was in second place, followed by the UK and Germany, although the top five countries actually visited were all in Asia.<br></p> <p>The UK, which is outside the EU\u2019s Schengen area of passport-free travel, attracts barely one-third of the tourists who went to France: between January and September 2014, 619,294 Chinese tourists visited France, but only 239,967 went to the UK, fewer than went to Switzerland, Germany or Russia.<br></p> <p>Last year, George Osborne announced that 25,000 Chinese tourists visiting the UK in organised groups could get their <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29184299\">visa costs refunded</a>, as the government seeks to entice more high-spending holidaymakers to visit Britain. Bicester\u2019s retail village, in Oxfordshire, is among the most popular UK destinations for Chinese tourists. <br></p> <p>The ETC said it had not yet seen any change in Chinese tourists\u2019 holiday intentions since the changes were announced.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The idea that increased income inequality makes economies more dynamic has been rejected by an International Monetary Fund study, which shows the widening income gap between rich and poor is bad for growth. A report by five IMF economists dismissed \u201ctrickle-down\u201d economics, and said that if governments wanted to increase the pace of growth they should concentrate on helping the poorest 20% of citizens. The study \u2013 covering advanced, emerging and developing countries \u2013 said technological progress, weaker trade unions, globalisation and tax policies that favoured the wealthy had all played their part in making widening inequality \u201cthe defining challenge of our time\u201d. The IMF report said the way income is distributed matters for growth. \u201cIf the income share of the top 20% increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. In contrast, an increase in the income share of the bottom 20% is associated with higher GDP growth,\u201d said the report. Echoing the frequent warnings about rising inequality from the IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, the report says governments around the world need to tackle the problem. It said: \u201cRaising the income share of the poor, and ensuring that there is no hollowing-out of the middle class, is actually good for growth.\u201d The study, however, reflects the tension between the IMF\u2019s economic analysis and the more hardline policy advice given to individual countries such as Greece, which need financial support. During its negotiations with Athens, the IMF has been seeking to weaken workers\u2019 rights, but the research paper found that the easing of labour market regulations was associated with greater inequality and a boost to the incomes of the richest 10%. \u201cThis result is consistent with forthcoming IMF work, which finds the weakening of unions is associated with a higher top 10% income share for a smaller sample of advanced economies,\u201d said the study. \u201cIndeed, empirical estimations using more detailed data for Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries [34 of the world\u2019s richest nations] suggest that, in line with other forthcoming IMF work, more lax hiring and firing regulations, lower minimum wages relative to the median wage, and less prevalent collective bargaining and trade unions are associated with higher market inequality.\u201d The study said there was growing evidence to suggest that rising influence of the rich and stagnant incomes of the poor and middle classes caused financial crises, hurting both short- and long-term growth. \u201cIn particular, studies have argued that a prolonged period of higher inequality in advanced economies was associated with the global financial crisis by intensifying leverage, overextension of credit, and a relaxation in mortgage-underwriting standards, and allowing lobbyists to push for financial deregulation,\u201d it said. It added that pretax incomes of middle-class households in the US, the UK, and Japan had experienced declining or stagnant growth rates in recent years. Additional pressures on the middle class reflected a declining share of labour income \u2013 the predominant source of income for the majority of households. Inequality could lead to policies that hurt growth, the IMF study said, noting that it could it could cause a backlash against growth-enhancing economic liberalisation and fuel-protectionist pressures against globalisation and market-oriented reforms. \u201cAt the same time, enhanced power by the elite could result in a more limited provision of public goods that boost productivity and growth, and which disproportionately benefit the poor.\u201d The paper called for extra investment in health and education policies that reduce poverty, and more progressive taxation. \u201cFiscal policy already plays a significant role in addressing income inequality in many advanced economies, but the redistributive role of fiscal policy could be reinforced by greater reliance on wealth and property taxes, more progressive income taxation, removing opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion, better targeting of social benefits while also minimising efficiency costs, in terms of incentives to work and save.\u201d",

It said: \u201cRaising the income share of the poor, and ensuring that there is no hollowing-out of the middle class, is actually good for growth.\u201d</p> <p>The study, however, reflects the tension between the IMF\u2019s economic analysis and the more hardline policy advice given to individual countries such as Greece, which need financial support.</p> <p>During its negotiations with Athens, the IMF has been seeking to weaken workers\u2019 rights, but the research paper found that the easing of labour market regulations was associated with greater inequality and a boost to the incomes of the richest 10%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Raising the income share of the poor and ensuring that there is no hollowing-out of the middle class is good for growth</p> <footer> <cite>IMF report</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis result is consistent with forthcoming IMF work, which finds the weakening of unions is associated with a higher top 10% income share for a smaller sample of advanced economies,\u201d said the study.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed, empirical estimations using more detailed data for Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries [34 of the world\u2019s richest nations] suggest that, in line with other forthcoming IMF work, more lax hiring and firing regulations, lower minimum wages relative to the median wage, and less prevalent collective bargaining and trade unions are associated with higher market inequality.\u201d </p> <p>The study said there was growing evidence to suggest that rising influence of the rich and stagnant incomes of the poor and middle classes caused financial crises, hurting both short- and long-term growth.</p> <p>\u201cIn particular, studies have argued that a prolonged period of higher inequality in advanced economies was associated with the global financial crisis by intensifying leverage, overextension of credit, and a relaxation in mortgage-underwriting standards, and allowing lobbyists to push for financial deregulation,\u201d it said.</p> <p>It added that pretax incomes of middle-class households in the US, the UK, and Japan had experienced declining or stagnant growth rates in recent years. Additional pressures on the middle class reflected a declining share of labour income \u2013 the predominant source of income for the majority of households. <br></p> <p>Inequality could lead to policies that hurt growth, the IMF study said, noting that it could it could cause a backlash against growth-enhancing economic liberalisation and fuel-protectionist pressures against globalisation and market-oriented reforms. \u201cAt the same time, enhanced power by the elite could result in a more limited provision of public goods that boost productivity and growth, and which disproportionately benefit the poor.\u201d<br></p> <p>The paper called for extra investment in health and education policies that reduce poverty, and more progressive taxation. \u201cFiscal policy already plays a significant role in addressing income inequality in many advanced economies, but the redistributive role of fiscal policy could be reinforced by greater reliance on wealth and property taxes, more progressive income taxation, removing opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion, better targeting of social benefits while also minimising efficiency costs, in terms of incentives to work and save.\u201d <br></p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Why is this a crunch week for Greece? The Athens government has been in debt talks with its international creditors for months in a bid to get them to release a last chunk of held-up bailout funds and avert bankruptcy. It needs the money to meet debt repayments and without it there is a fear that Greece will end up defaulting, which could precipitate its exit from the eurozone. Talks at the weekend ended in a stalemate. Eurozone finance ministers meet on Thursday, possibly the last chance to unlock badly needed rescue funds for Greece before it has to repay \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.2bn) to the International Monetary Fund at the end of June. What are the debt talks? After bailouts in 2010 and 2012, Greece owes money to the so-called Brussels Group, made up of the IMF, the European commission and European Central Bank (ECB). A further \u20ac7.2bn in bailout money is still to be paid out to Greece by the trio of creditors. The creditors, also known as the troika, want to see more reforms in Greece in return for releasing the last lump of rescue funds. Greece\u2019s government, led by Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, contends that austerity measures demanded by creditors are too harsh and that some of its huge debts need writing off or shifting back for much later repayment if the country is ever to get back on its feet. Tsipras came to power on an anti-austerity ticket in January and is refusing to accept new spending cuts and tax rises to achieve the budget surpluses demanded by Greece\u2019s lenders. Tsipras has indicated he would accept compromises on the lenders\u2019 austerity demands in return for debt relief \u2013 the writing off or rescheduling of some of Greece\u2019s debt. But debt relief, and the prospect of never recovering money owed, is staunchly opposed by Germany, the biggest contributor to Greece\u2019s \u20ac240bn bailouts. Where have the two sides got to? Last-ditch talks on Sunday collapsed in acrimony after 45 minutes. European Union officials dismissed Greece\u2019s latest reform package as incomplete and said there was still a \u20ac2bn gap between Athens and the trio of lenders in terms of yearly permanent budget savings. Greece continues to insist on softer terms for the rescue funds. Tsipras implied on Monday that he would continue to resist demands to raise taxes and cut pensions. \u201cOne can only see a political purposefulness in the insistence of creditors on new cuts in pensions after five years of looting under the bailouts,\u201d he said in a statement to the Greek newspaper Ton Syntakton. \u201cWe will await patiently until the institutions accede to realism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not have the right to bury European democracy at the place where it was born.\u201d After the breakdown of Sunday\u2019s talks, the IMF sought to bring the parties closer together, with its chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, making suggestions for both sides. He said Brussels should be prepared to delay more of Greece\u2019s debt repayments, accept only limited reforms and cut the interest applied to debt-relief loans, while Tsipras should offer further pension reforms and accept that some VAT exemptions must be dropped. What happens this week? On Wednesday, the ECB\u2019s governing council meets and will discuss whether to extend emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) for Greece. The ECB has been drip-feeding this support to Greek banks as they struggle with dwindling deposits because worried Greek savers are pulling their money out of accounts to keep at home or move overseas. However, as the name implies, this was never intended to be a long-term measure to keep a eurozone country afloat and the ECB has come under pressure to pull the plug. On Thursday, eurozone finance ministers gather in Luxembourg, and the cash-for-reform talks will resume. Headlines say time is running out. Is it? Over five months of fruitless talks, phrases like \u201clast-ditch\u201d and \u201ccrunch time\u201d have been used again and again. But a look at Greece\u2019s debt repayment schedule suggest things really are coming to a head now. Greece has a heavy calendar of debt repayments, as the chart below shows (note that the June payments to the IMF are now due in one lump sum of \u20ac1.6bn on 30 June, after Greece was allowed to bundle them together). Greece also needs funds for domestic spending obligations such as paying public-sector workers and pensions. Without the held-up bailout money Greece will sooner or later miss a debt repayment \u2013 technically defaulting. As Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at the broker CMC Markets UK, says: The fact is, unless some significant concessions are made on either side, a default is now more or less inevitable, and even if a plan were agreed that was agreeable to the creditors, it is unlikely that the Greek government would be able to get it through their parliament. Given that Germany won\u2019t countenance anything like debt relief at this point, we are likely set to see a continuation of this game of political cat and mouse through this week\u2019s Eurogroup finance ministers\u2019 meeting on Thursday, and beyond to the end of the month. Hewson and other analysts say it is now only a matter of time before capital controls are introduced in Greece, whereby limits are placed on what savers can withdraw from banks. Views vary over whether Greece can avoid a default and eventual exit from the eurozone, termed the \u201cGrexit\u201d. The French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said on Monday: Our economists\u2019 base-case scenario [60% probability] remains that a last-minute deal will be struck, leading to a semi-stable scenario, but most likely not before the EU summit on 25-26 June. Alastair Winter, chief economist at the broker Daniel Stewart, paints a gloomy picture: Mr Tsipras had better get ready to blink if he wants to get a single additional euro from Germany or, indeed, any of the other member countries. Of course, he too may have given up on reaching an agreement and is keeping up appearances simply to impress Greek voters. Either way, he is no longer in last-chance saloon but no-chance saloon. What is happening to Greece\u2019s economy in the meantime? As talks grind on, Greece\u2019s economy has fallen back into recession. A sharp drop in investment by increasingly nervous businesses and falling imports and exports left GDP down 0.2% in the first quarter after a 0.4% drop in the final months of 2014, according to the latest figures. Unemployment remains the highest in the eurozone at more than 25%. Youth unemployment is above 50%. In the financial sector, capital flight continues and Greek bank deposits have slumped to a decade low. Will Greece really leave the eurozone? Greece does not automatically leave the eurozone if it defaults on its debts. Some analysts argue all parties will want to avoid Grexit, even in the case of a default, given the long-term damage it could inflict on the euro project. Jean-Pierre Durante, at Pictet Wealth Management, comments: Even in the event of default, Grexit should be avoided. It is not in anyone\u2019s interests for Greece to leave the eurozone. For Greece, it would mean widespread bankruptcies. For the remaining eurozone members, the fact that a precedent of exit had been established would probably lead to a permanent upwards re-pricing of their sovereign debt. For both sides, it would be a very risky leap into the unknown. A short-lived default should not therefore lead to Grexit. It would not be the end of the road for Greece, but potentially the precursor to a breakthrough on a longer-term deal. But others argue Greece would need considerable help recapitalising its banks following a default, given those banks own significant amounts of government bonds and government-guaranteed bonds and they would slump in value after a default. Greek banks also use their government bonds and government-guaranteed bonds as collateral to raise funds at the ECB but that would no longer be possible after a default, further raising the pressure on Greece\u2019s financial system. The ELA support that has been propping up the system would probably end. All this raises the risk of Grexit. Without the help of European partners, recapitalising the banks would probably require issuing IOUs or in fact a new currency altogether \u2013 in other words Greece leaves the euro. Traders polled by Reuters on Monday put the chances of Grexit at one in three, higher than just a month ago. If it leaves, Greece would move to a drastically devalued currency. That could attract tourists and overseas manufacturers keen to take advantage of cheap deals on holidays and labour, respectively. But in the short-term, Grexit would entail capital controls, financial market chaos and high inflation. What happens to the rest of the eurozone if Greece leaves? There are plenty of risks to the eurozone aside from the damaging symbolism for politicians such as the German leader, Angela Merkel, of presiding over the first departure from the single currency. Near-term worries focus on volatility in financial markets and damage to the euro currency. A disorderly exit by Greece would probably raise fears about the other eurozone countries that were worst hit by the financial crisis and the interest rates on their government bonds would rise. On the other hand, banks around Europe have reduced their exposure to Greece and the ECB has insisted financial buffers are sufficient to prevent contagion to other weak economies in the currency union. In the longer term, there is the worry that Greece leaving may well prompt other countries to follow, threatening the entire eurozone project. Gary Jenkins, chief credit strategist at asset manager LNG Capital, says much would depend on whether Grexit can be turned into a \u201cseminal moment\u201d that brings the remaining eurozone countries closer together, such as through jointly issued bonds. Much would depend upon the response of the eurozone and the ECB in the short term, economic growth (or the lack of) in the medium term and of course the economic performance of Greece relative to the other eurozone countries in the longer term... So we could soon find out if the eurozone/ECB really do have a plan B. One would hope so, after all, as a certain Mr Wilde might have said: to lose one country may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose two looks like carelessness.",

Greece\u2019s creditors demand that Athens should cut pensions further. But the Greek government says it has gone as far as it can go. In recent years, Greece\u2019s much-criticised pension system has seen a slight improvement. It is no longer rated as the weakest in the world. It is now ranked eighth lowest in the world. The previous government cut pensions (although a court has recently ruled that measures carried out in 2012 were unconstitutional), became better at identifying bogus claims and collecting debt, and had passed legislation to reduce supplementary pensions by preventing the state from subsidising such payments. There has been some progress on pensions under the leftwing government of Alexis Tsipras, however. The current administration has pledged to continue to integrate pension funds (in 2008, Greece had more than 100 separately administered funds), to phase out some early retirements and progressively reduce higher pensions. It has also promised to halt legal oddities, including those loopholes enabled by job categories entitled to retire early due to \u201chazardous working conditions\u201d, meant for sectors such as bomb disposal, yet also covered radio and television presenters (at risk from the bacteria on their microphones), musicians playing wind instruments and hairdressers. But it\u2019s not enough. Make no mistake, Greece\u2019s pension system is not sustainable and still needs major reform. As a proportion of GDP, no country in the EU spends as much as Greece\u2019s 17.5% on pensions, according to Eurostat: What\u2019s more, in Greece the size of the deficit in the pension system is 9% of GDP, compared with 3% of GDP in Germany. Funding shortfalls remain. Pension funds have lost at least \u20ac25bn since 2012. The system remains mired in bureaucracy and the pace of change is slow. The government\u2019s tax-revenue shortfall in January alone was 23% below its \u20ac4.5bn target for the month. There is also a backlog of more than 400,000 pension applications to deal with (many of which are requests for early retirement) that will add to the country\u2019s existing tally of 2.65 million pensioners. As part of a package of savings and tax increases, Greece\u2019s creditors are demanding the government cut pensions by the equivalent of 1% of gross domestic output, a more rapid clampdown on early retirees and for supplementary pensions to be financed by contributions, not by the state (which would effectively mean cutting them further). But can the refusal of Tsipras and the Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, to comply with these demands simply be explained by a stubborn unwillingness to reform? In order to answer this question, we should consider the following: First, demographics. About 20.5% of Greeks are over 65 \u2013 behind only Italy and Germany in the EU when it comes to an ageing population. And with the country\u2019s youth unemployment rate still above 50%, its young people are not going to be able to pay for their grandparents pensions any time soon. Second, Greek society has a dependency on pensioners. One in two households rely on pensions to make ends meet and the country has an old-age dependancy ratio above 30%, which means that for every 100 people of working age in Greece there are 30 people aged 65 or over. Third, Greek pensions aren\u2019t so generous. About 45% of pensioners receive pensions below what is considered the poverty limit of \u20ac665 per month. Looking at the actual expenditure on beneficiaries, Greece\u2019s figures don\u2019t stand out as exceptional and are instead on par with the EU average: What makes the country\u2019s pension system unsustainable is not the specific size of each individual pension, but the overall cost of a grossly inefficient and badly funded system (yes, mainly due to of decades of endemic tax evasion that means as much tax revenue slips through Athens\u2019 fingers as it collects). According to analysis by Macropolis, the average pension in Greece is roughly \u20ac700 per month, while the supplementary one is \u20ac169. The same analysis also shows that nearly 90% (\u20ac2.07bn) of the total monthly expenditure (\u20ac2.35bn) on pensions in March went towards the main pension. It also reveals that only 0.6% of supplementary pensions were above \u20ac500 a month. For 60% of pensioners the total gross monthly intake is below \u20ac800. In addition, many retirees in Greece have already seen their pensions cut. Some by a third, others by nearly 50%. Fourth, although there can be no doubt that many Greeks will have jumped on early retirement possibilities, exploited loopholes and claimed pensions when they weren\u2019t allowed to, one needs to only look at the change in the unemployment rate among 55-64 year olds \u2013 it now stands at 20%, up from 6% five years ago \u2013 to realise that many will have opted for early retirement not because they wanted to, but because they were unable to find work - and a pension is often the only safety net. Fifth, sustaining pensions through contributions alone is a just endeavour but doing so by raising taxation, mainly on consumption, is a questionable prescription given the patient\u2019s state. In 2012, pension funds, which were obliged under a law introduced in 1950 by the then king of Greece, Paul I, to keep a minimum of 77% of their assets in government bonds, took an \u20ac8.3bn hit following the restructuring of sovereign debt.

However, it would do little to solve the underlying challenges in the longer term. The wider problem The key point is there is no question that the Greek pension system, and broader economic fundamentals, are unsustainable. But so too is Greece\u2019s societal and humanitarian predicament. There is a clear conflict between the economics, society and the politics, the immediate versus the long term. And there is no single solution that can immediately satisfy all three conundrums simultaneously. But the risk is that by continuing to pull in different directions in search of a one-size-fits-all answer, the fabric of Greece, and with it possibly that of the wider eurozone, will eventually tear.

The Greek stock market slumped by almost 7% in early trading, as traders showed alarm that a deal will not be reached before the country\u2019s bailout programme expires on 30 June. Despite growing pressure, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is refusing to accept new spending cuts and tax rises to achieve the budget surpluses demanded by Greece\u2019s lenders. \u201cOne can only see a political purposefulness in the insistence of creditors on new cuts in pensions after five years of looting under the bailouts,\u201d Tsipras told Greek newspaper Efimerida Ton Syntakton on Monday morning. \u201cWe will wait patiently until the institutions accede to realism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not have the right to bury European democracy at the place where it was born.\u201d The war of words between the two sides continued, with Jens Weidmann, the head of Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, saying time was running out for Greece. Greek financial shares were routed on Monday morning, with Piraeus Bank tumbling by 18% and Eurobanks down 15%, dragging the Athens market to its lowest point since mid-April.

      "bodyText": "Majestic Wine is considering scrapping its minimum six-bottle purchase as the new chief executive, Rowan Gormley, seeks to revamp stores and revive the ailing business. Gormley, who took over in April, said Majestic\u2019s warehouse-style stores and minimum-order requirement put off customers. He said the company would experiment over the next six months before settling on a new format. For the year ended 30 March, pre-tax profit excluding exceptional items fell 12% to \u00a320.9m. Profit will fall again this year as Gormley spends \u00a33m on improving service and stores. Majestic appointed Gormley when it bought his Naked Wines online business two months ago. He replaced Steve Lewis, who left after poor Christmas trading capped a period of disappointing results. Majestic was founded in 1980, selling wines by the case to retail customers from a warehouse in Wood Green, north London. The company grew to become Britain\u2019s biggest wine retailer but it has faced stiff competition from supermarkets and online wine retailers. Lewis halved the minimum purchase to six bottles in 2009 but Gormley said the restriction helped deter people from shopping at Majestic. \u201cWhat customers are saying is they find the warehouse format, the six-bottle minimum and the discount pricing structure difficult and intimidating. The six-bottle minimum comes up again and again so it\u2019s something we will have to test,\u201d Gormley said. The warehouse setup, with cases piled high around the store, may also have had its day, he said. \u201cThe reason a number of new customers who walk into the store walk out again is that they thought it was a wholesale store.\u201d High turnover of store managers and understaffed branches have also taken their toll, he said. When shop managers left, usually to work elsewhere in the wine trade, store sales fell and the company\u2019s response was to cut staff, causing a vicious circle. \u201cCustomers tell us: \u2018Every time I go in a store there\u2019s a different person there. Nobody knows the wines I like and nobody treats me as an individual.\u2019\u201d Majestic\u2019s main computer systems are 10 years out of date and need overhauling to support a business selling online and in shops. They would also give branch managers data on individual customers so they can suggest new wines. Gormley said it would take three years to revive Majestic. Improving the computer systems will take two years and another year will be needed to implement changes across the branch network. Majestic\u2019s shares had risen 40% since the purchase of Naked Wines and Gormley\u2019s appointment were announced but they fell as much as 5% to 418p after the results announcement. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \u201cAfter the excitement about the future for the merger of Majestic Wine and Naked Wines after the deal was announced, today has brought the City back down to earth with the warning that that things will get worse before they get better.\u201d",

Profit will fall again this year as Gormley spends \u00a33m on improving service and stores.</p> <p>Majestic appointed Gormley <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/10/majestic-wine-to-buy-online-retailer-naked-wines-for-70m\">when it bought his Naked Wines online business</a> two months ago. He replaced Steve Lewis, who left after poor Christmas trading capped a period of disappointing results.</p> <p>Majestic was founded in 1980, selling wines by the case to retail customers from a warehouse in Wood Green, north London. The company grew to become Britain\u2019s biggest wine retailer but it has faced stiff competition from supermarkets and online wine retailers. </p> <p>Lewis <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/19/wine-review-majestic\">halved the minimum purchase to six bottles in 2009</a> but Gormley said the restriction helped deter people from shopping at Majestic. </p> <p>\u201cWhat customers are saying is they find the warehouse format, the six-bottle minimum and the discount pricing structure difficult and intimidating. The six-bottle minimum comes up again and again so it\u2019s something we will have to test,\u201d Gormley said. </p> <p>The warehouse setup, with cases piled high around the store, may also have had its day, he said. \u201cThe reason a number of new customers who walk into the store walk out again is that they thought it was a wholesale store.\u201d</p> <p>High turnover of store managers and understaffed branches have also taken their toll, he said. When shop managers left, usually to work elsewhere in the wine trade, store sales fell and the company\u2019s response was to cut staff, causing a vicious circle. </p> <p>\u201cCustomers tell us: \u2018Every time I go in a store there\u2019s a different person there. Nobody knows the wines I like and nobody treats me as an individual.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Majestic\u2019s main computer systems are 10 years out of date and need overhauling to support a business selling online and in shops. They would also give branch managers data on individual customers so they can suggest new wines.</p> <p>Gormley said it would take three years to revive Majestic. Improving the computer systems will take two years and another year will be needed to implement changes across the branch network.</p> <p>Majestic\u2019s shares had risen 40% since the purchase of Naked Wines and Gormley\u2019s appointment were announced but they fell as much as 5% to 418p after the results announcement.</p> <p>Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \u201cAfter the excitement about the future for the merger of Majestic Wine and Naked Wines after the deal was announced, today has brought the City back down to earth with the warning that that things will get worse before they get better.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "You would think there is nothing surer in life than death and taxes \u2013 and the belief that people think they pay too much tax. But the latest annual survey on attitudes towards taxation by the progressive thinktank Per Capita reveals that people are mostly satisfied with the amount of tax they pay. The survey also found that the number of people who believe they are taxed too high has fallen dramatically from 2012 and there are now more high-income earners who believe they pay too little tax than those who believe they pay too much. Taxation is a vexed issue for governments. It is needed to pay for services and yet increasing taxes is considered a politically risky move, especially when applied to income tax. In the early 1990s Paul Keating infamously advised then UK opposition leader, Tony Blair: \u201cDon\u2019t ever put up income tax, mate. Take it [money] off them anyhow you please, but do that and they\u2019d rip your fucking guts out.\u201d From the results of the 2015 Per Capita tax survey it would appear Keating knew what he was talking about. When the 1,413 people in the survey were asked about collecting tax for \u201cquality public services\u201d, raising income tax was the least favoured way: The only response less popular than raising income tax was the suggestion the government should borrow more. As the report\u2019s author David Hetherington notes, the Abbott government\u2019s \u201cunequivocal message that further debt is unhealthy for the Australian economy\u201d appears to have struck a chord with the public. Not surprisingly, respondents were most in favour of the government raising revenue in ways which wouldn\u2019t directly affect their income. Sixty-five per cent of respondents were in favour of cutting corporate tax avoidance, while 44% were in favour of increased income tax \u2013 so long as it was only on the richest 5% of income earners. Should the government wish to tinker with the GST, it would seem people are most comfortable with the range of items which already receive tax. Whereas 15% suggested they would be happy to see the current 10% GST rate increased, only 9% would prefer to see the GST broadened to include private education and health. Somewhat confusingly, 13% want to see it broadened to include all items \u2013 such as food. But changing the GST is much less popular than cutting negative gearing. Thirty-five per cent surveyed were in favour of such as move \u2013 suggesting the Greens latest policy to phase out negative gearing for new housing investments could find some broad support. This is also supported by the responses to Per Capita\u2019s specific question about negative gearing and what changes should be made to the system. Only 16% of respondents suggested it should not be changed at all. Fifty-eight per cent of those surveyed wished to see some restrictions placed on negative gearing \u2013from 19% who wanted it abolished completely to just 8% who wanted it restricted only to new buildings. That a number of respondents answered \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d, however, suggests this is still a debate there to be won by either side. Clearly the impetus is with those arguing in favour of change. One debate that clearly has been won is on the GP co-payment. Per Capita found while 32% were in favour or either a $5 or $7 co-payment, a majority were against any co-payment at all: A majority also agreed they were paying the right level of tax; 50% believed they paid \u201cabout the right amount\u201d. This was down from 53% in 2014 but well above the mere 35% content with the amount of tax they paid in 2012: But while most believe they themselves pay the right amount of tax, there is a strong belief that the wealthiest pay too little. Sixty-seven per cent of people believed high-income earners paid too little \u2013 this was down from 72% last year but well up from 55% in 2012: Now while it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that a majority believe the richest should pay more tax \u2013 given most people are not high-income earners \u2013 what is surprising is more high-income earners believe they pay too little tax than too much: Thirty-eight per cent of those who earn more than $200,000 believe high-income earners pay too little tax, and only 35% believe they pay too much. Similarly, while 57.3% of those who earn between $150,000 and $200,000 believe high-income earners pay too little tax, only 9% believe they pay too little. Now perhaps there is a fair amount of non-self-selection going on here. Those earning above $150,000 but less than $200,000 may not see themselves as high earners. Though given the top income tax bracket kicks in at $180,000, they would be suspending a fair degree of disbelief about their wealth. People\u2019s views of reality on taxation does not often accord with the actual state of affairs. When asked whether compared with other nations Australia was a low, medium or high taxing nation with a small,medium or big government, a near majority, 47%, believed we have a high-taxing, big government. This figure was down from 57% in 2012 \u2013 perhaps as Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey\u2019s rhetoric of a big spending and debt-ridden ALP government was in full cry: Since 2012 our tax level has actually increased. Despite this, Australia remains very much on the low taxing side of the ledger. In 2012 (the latest complete figures) Australia was the seventh lowest taxing nation in the OECD: The results of the survey shows the impact of the political debate on people\u2019s views on taxation. The 2014 budget and resulting debate has put a spotlight on tax equality. People still wish to have quality public services such as health and education, but the anti-debt campaign of the past five years has had an impact. People have little desire to increase public debt. They also don\u2019t just want taxation in general increased. The view that the tax system needs to address equality is highlighted through people\u2019s preference to pay for spending by closing taxation loopholes on big business, reducing negative gearing and increasing taxation on the wealthiest.",

This was down from 53% in 2014 but well above the mere 35% content with the amount of tax they paid in 2012:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1dNC5/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But while most believe they themselves pay the right amount of tax, there is a strong belief that the wealthiest pay too little. Sixty-seven per cent of people believed high-income earners paid too little \u2013 this was down from 72% last year but well up from 55% in 2012:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 3\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/X0O84/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Now while it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that a majority believe the richest should pay more tax \u2013 given most people are not high-income earners \u2013 what is surprising is more high-income earners believe they pay too little tax than too much:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 5\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2rB2K/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Thirty-eight per cent of those who earn more than $200,000 believe high-income earners pay too little tax, and only 35% believe they pay too much.</p> <p>Similarly, while 57.3% of those who earn between $150,000 and $200,000 believe high-income earners pay too little tax, only 9% believe they pay too little. </p> <p>Now perhaps there is a fair amount of non-self-selection going on here. Those earning above $150,000 but less than $200,000 may not see themselves as high earners. Though given the top income tax bracket kicks in at $180,000, they would be suspending a fair degree of disbelief about their wealth. </p> <p>People\u2019s views of reality on taxation does not often accord with the actual state of affairs. </p> <p>When asked whether compared with other nations Australia was a low, medium or high taxing nation with a small,medium or big government, a near majority, 47%, believed we have a high-taxing, big government. </p> <p>This figure was down from 57% in 2012 \u2013 perhaps as Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey\u2019s rhetoric of a big spending and debt-ridden ALP government was in full cry:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 8\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qAVax/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Since 2012 our tax level has actually increased. Despite this, Australia remains very much on the low taxing side of the ledger.</p> <p>In 2012 (the latest complete figures) Australia was the seventh lowest taxing nation in the OECD: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 6\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ehTqU/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The results of the survey shows the impact of the political debate on people\u2019s views on taxation. The 2014 budget and resulting debate has put a spotlight on tax equality. People still wish to have quality public services such as health and education, but the anti-debt campaign of the past five years has had an impact. </p> <p>People have little desire to increase public debt. They also don\u2019t just want taxation in general increased. The view that the tax system needs to address equality is highlighted through people\u2019s preference to pay for spending by closing taxation loopholes on big business, reducing negative gearing and increasing taxation on the wealthiest. </p>",
