      "bodyText": "Mark Carney has just made Sir Philip Green\u2019s life even more difficult. The retail tycoon\u2019s bid to bail out the BHS pension scheme, and hold on to his knighthood, could have soared to more than \u00a3700m after the Bank of England governor presided over a cut in interest rates last week. Adding to the pressure, the Bank also pumped more cash into the UK economy in a move that hit gilt yields \u2013 the return on government debt. The cut in borrowing costs to 0.25%, combined with a new round of quantitative easing, sent gilt yields crashing to a new low. This could add another 7% to pension scheme deficits, according to consultancy Hymans Robertson, which would add nearly \u00a350m to the BHS bill. In order to ensure that members of BHS\u2019s schemes receive full pension benefits, Green\u2019s total bill could now be about \u00a3717m, valued by the most pessimistic measure which includes the cost of an insurance company taking on the scheme\u2019s liabilities. The last official measure of the deficit showed it was \u00a3571m. Green, who sold BHS for \u00a31 to the formerly bankrupt Dominic Chappell about a year before the retailer went into administration, remains on the hook for bailing out the collapsed chain\u2019s pension deficit because regulators have powers to pursue former owners. The fiery entrepreneur is also battling to rescue his reputation, as he has been widely criticised for selling on the business with a huge pension deficit and leaving the incomes of more than 20,000 pensioners at risk. When BHS went into administration, the pension scheme automatically fell under the auspices of the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which is funded by levies on company pension schemes. A plunge in the value of gilt yields after the EU referendum contributed to a near-19% rise in the average value of pension deficits controlled by the PPF between February and June. That suggests a rise of about \u00a3100m for the BHS scheme\u2019s maximum deficit, taking it to \u00a3670m. Last week\u2019s action by the Bank of England has sent it soaring again. However, Green is unlikely to have to stump up the new total of \u00a3717m. Appearing before a parliamentary inquiry into the demise of BHS last month, Green said he would \u201csort\u201d the pension deficit. He expressed a determination to offer BHS pensioners more than they would have got under the PPF\u2019s lifeboat scheme, which trims future benefits by 10%. Offering the same as the PPF would cost Green about \u00a3350m at present gilt yield returns, and this is likely to be his starting point. He is expected to try to offset this bill by offering to buy out those BHS pensioners who have pension pots of \u00a318,000 or less \u2013 about 17,000 people. They would get the benefit of cash in their hands which they can invest elsewhere, and the cost to Green would be less than the long-term cost of servicing their pension terms. It\u2019s not clear how much offering these so-called \u201cwind-up lump sums\u201d might cut the total bill by, but it could be at least \u00a3100m. Buying out some of the company\u2019s pensioners would still leave the question of how to serve those wishing to remain in a scheme. Green\u2019s advisers are thought to have proposed the bulk transfer of members to a new scheme linked to a shell company, a financial vehicle that would underpin future pension payments. However, the PPF has previously signalled its distaste for such structures and is unlikely to support such a proposal. In a response to a public consultation on handling of the pension schemes linked to ailing firm Tata Steel, the PPF said it was concerned that \u201cin the absence of a genuine sponsoring employer, PPF levy-payers would be directly underwriting the risk of the existing or new scheme\u2019s investment strategy failing\u201d. Green\u2019s Arcadia group, which owns Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, could potentially be lined up as a sponsor. But this is problematic because the company is already dealing with its own pension deficit, last valued at nearly \u00a3190m. It is difficult to see how Arcadia\u2019s board would approve such a move. Topshop, Arcadia\u2019s most prized asset, is also 25%-owned by private equity firm Leonard Green, further complicating the group\u2019s involvement. A spokesman for Arcadia has previously said: \u201cThe Arcadia pension fund is well funded and well run. The deficit has widened in the past two years, as it has in almost all occupational schemes, but is still modest in the context of a company that makes \u00a3240m a year and has no debt at the operating level.\u201d Arcadia pays about \u00a325m a year into the scheme, which the company\u2019s spokesman said was \u201cample given the size of the deficit\u201d. Ultimately, a settlement is likely to hinge on Green securing a pragmatic deal with the Pensions Regulator. The watchdog has powers to pursue interested parties for money which it deems have been extracted from a company to the detriment of a pension fund. It is not just the Green family that could be pursued as the former controlling party of BHS. Their Arcadia group and the directors of Dominic Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions, the group that bought BHS for \u00a31 just over a year before it went bust, could also come under pressure. The regulator will want to avoid lengthy and costly legal battles as it seeks a solution. But the size of the problem, for all concerned, just got bigger. What Green could sell off Sir Philip Green has said he is making \u201creal progress\u201d in talks with regulators about a bailout for the BHS pension scheme. However, even if the tycoon does reach a deal with the Pensions Regulator to resolve the shortfall in BHS pensions, which now could be as much as \u00a3717m, there are questions about how he will raise the cash. Even for a billionaire, raising hundreds of millions in cash quickly is not straightforward. Green and his family are estimated to be worth \u00a33.5bn, according to the latest Sunday Times Rich List. However, Green may have to sell assets to raise the money for the pension scheme. Here is a list of main assets in the family empire and where the tycoon might turn to solve the BHS pensions scandal. Arcadia Green\u2019s main retail business \u2013 Arcadia \u2013 owns Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Miss Selfridge, Wallis, Outfit and 75% of Topshop and Topman. The latest accounts for Taveta Investments, Green\u2019s main investment company and the ultimate parent of Arcadia, show that in the year to 29 August 2015 it generated sales of \u00a32.4bn and pre-tax profits of \u00a3151m, up from \u00a3118m the previous year. If you value Arcadia at the same price-to-earnings ratio as its listed high street rivals, such as Marks &amp; Spencer, then it is worth around \u00a31.75bn. However, some of the company\u2019s brands, such as Burton, appear in desperate need of significant investment. The BHS saga may also have dampened the appetite of others in the retail industry to do business with Green. One senior retail source said: \u201cWho is going to buy anything off PG at the moment given the scrutiny that Dominic Chappell came under? ... The guys who have the money to do this are not going to give him the price he needs to get out of trouble.\u201d Topshop The US private equity firm Leonard Green &amp; Partners bought a 25% stake in Topshop for \u00a3350m in 2012, giving the brand a value of \u00a31.4bn. Green could further sell down his stake in Topshop, although some analysts believe it could now be worth less. Analysing the strength of Topshop is difficult because its operations are closely linked with the rest of the Arcadia empire. Topshop/Topman Ltd increased sales marginally from \u00a3999m to \u00a31bn last year, with pre-tax profits rising \u00a3108m to \u00a3113m. However, the accounts for Arcadia Group (USA) suggest that Topshop\u2019s expansion in the US has not been straightforward: it recorded a loss of \u00a313m in the last financial year. Nonetheless, Topshop appears to remain extremely valuable to Arcadia and Green. As part of the Leonard Green deal and the movement of Topshop\u2019s assets and brand outside Arcadia, Topshop issued a \u00a3600m loan note to Arcadia. In the last financial year Topshop paid Arcadia \u00a352.5m in relation to the loan note, including \u00a327.5m in interest. Cash Green\u2019s wife Lady (Tina) Green, pictured, collected a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2005, the biggest in corporate history, as well as the majority of the \u00a3586m that was paid out of BHS in dividends, interest and rent when the family owned the retailer between 2000 and 2015. The family received another \u00a353m windfall last year when Arcadia bought BHS\u2019s headquarters from Lady Green, as well as \u00a370m from selling BHS store sites back to BHS as part of Dominic Chappell\u2019s controversial takeover. Furthermore, the parliamentary report in the collapse of BHS claims Lady Green receives payments from a loan that Taveta used to buy BHS in 2009 as part of a group restructuring. Last year Lady Green collected \u00a38.3m in interest and \u00a320m from an annual repayment of the loan. Property Taveta owns freehold, long leasehold and short leasehold property worth \u00a3552m, according to its 2015 accounts. However, this now looks a conservative estimate. Sources believe that Topshop\u2019s flagship store on Oxford Street in London \u2013 the jewel in the crown of Green\u2019s property portfolio \u2013 could be worth \u00a3500m on its own. There have been rumours for years in the gossipy world of West End property that Green \u2013 who owns the building through a company called Redcastle (214 Oxford Street) Ltd \u2013 could sell it. Any sale could allow the tycoon to raise the funds to deal with the BHS pension without any impact on his day-to-day business. Other In the words of the MPs who investigated the demise of the BHS, Green operates behind a \u201ccomplex web of companies, many registered offshore\u201d. Thus, it is difficult to establish how many other foreign vehicles are owned by Green and Lady Green. However, other assets include Shelton Capital, which owns 22% of online fashion retailer MySale, which is worth almost \u00a330m, as well as an apartment in Monaco worth an estimated \u00a320m and the family\u2019s new yacht, Lionheart, which cost as much as \u00a3100m.",

      "bodyText": "Oil may be a precious and dwindling resource, but at the moment, at least, it looks like we just have too much of it. Crude-oil prices are now at their lowest since early April, hit by continued oversupply, concerns about global demand and negative price sentiment by oil-market participants. And that situation looks likely to continue in the near future. The US crude oil benchmark price, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded at the New York Mercantile Exchange, closed at $39.51 a barrel on Tuesday, the first time since 6 April. The global Brent crude oil benchmark closed at $41.50 on Tuesday, a three-and-a-half-month low. As of midday Wednesday, prices were just above those levels. Prices rebounded by the end the week following a better-than-expected July US jobs report. September WTI crude oil settled at $41.83 a barrel and October Brent closed at $44.28. But US petroleum prices are down about 25% from the June highs of around $52, putting them in bear-market territory. However, they remain above the depths of the decade-plus price lows established in February, when US prices fell below $30 a barrel. Some of the reasons for crude oil\u2019s June rise are also responsible for its current retreat, market watchers said. There was a series of supply outages earlier this year, said Bill O\u2019Neill, a principal at the commodities consulting group Logic Advisors, such as Canadian wildfires in the oil-sands region, sharp production decreases in Nigeria and Libya and an oil workers\u2019 strike in Kuwait. \u201cThose have been more or less solved, or been alleviated. So we\u2019re seeing a glut of supply as production in most of those areas is returning,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. At the time there were hopes the production outages and relatively lower prices would mean higher demand would drain the bloated inventories to finally bring the crude oil market back into balance between supply and demand, said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. However, when US crude-oil prices hit $50, it encouraged some US shale-oil producers to open the spigots again, as evidenced by a few weeks of rising oil-rig counts, said Stewart Glickman, head of energy research at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. \u201cWhat had been a pretty precipitous decline in US production doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to be so precipitous anymore,\u201d Glickman said. As the new supply trickled in, oil refiners\u2019 profits were shrinking. With smaller margins and high inventory of products like gasoline and diesel, refiners had little incentive to produce more, leaving crude inventories to pile up, Glickman added. In the background is the decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to continue its market share grab and pump as much oil as possible. Some news reports suggest Opec\u2019s July production could hit a record because of increases from Iran and Nigeria. That bloated inventory is evident in data from the Department of Energy\u2019s statistical arm, the Energy Information Administration, which shows continued historically high levels of crude oil. Haworth said hopes were high the summer driving season would deplete some of those stocks. Demand is strong, but so far has been under expectations. \u201cThe market appears somewhat disappointed how inventory declines happened during peak seasonal demand \u2026 It happened less than we all expected,\u201d he said. The swiftness of oil\u2019s rally to $50 may have spooked users, said Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager for the InfraCap Active MLP exchange-traded fund (AMZA). \u201cPeople are sensitive to prices \u2026 we need lower prices to clean out the excess inventory,\u201d he said. Some worries about global demand contributed to the recent selloff. Chinese imported oil demand is slowing, said Haworth, Glickman and O\u2019Neill. Additionally, O\u2019Neill added there are still concerns about European demand following the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU and the lower-than-expected US gross domestic product data also weighed on sentiment. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing on the economic side that indicates a need to rush into buying,\u201d he said. Haworth, Hatfield and O\u2019Neill said as prices weakened into July, short-term traders followed the downward momentum and established positions to benefit from further price drops. That compounded the price break and helped to send values to the $40 level. Hatfield said in the near term there was little reason for demand to pick up since the energy markets are entering the \u201cshoulder season\u201d where refiners take downtime for maintenance, and as they get ready to switch from summer fuel blends to winter fuel blends. Weather during the next few months is usually temperate with no increased heating or cooling needs. Prices could dip a little further, but none of the market watchers expect a retreat to the $20s. Nor do they see prices going much above $50. Also, most investment banks haven\u2019t changed their long-term price forecasts for crude oil to be near $50 toward year\u2019s end. However, the crude-oil market\u2019s actions have confounded many in the past two years. Part of that might be because there\u2019s a still a bit of a bias that crude oil prices usually rise, O\u2019Neill said. \u201cMany markets have a bias [on price direction]. Being bullish on crude oil for the last 10 to 15 years clearly was right. But that might not be the case anymore,\u201d he said.",
