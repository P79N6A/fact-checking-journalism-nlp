    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was the banks and Gordon Brown wot did it. Neutered by New Labour and unable to prevent the City from behaving in an increasingly reckless fashion, the Bank of England could only issue reports and deliver sermons as Britain slid inexorably towards its worst financial and economic crisis since the 1930s. That is the recent past as seen through the eyes of Sir Mervyn King, and there will be many both in the financial sector and at Westminster who will raise more than a sceptical eyebrow at the governor's conclusions. King, they will argue, is now rewriting history in order to salvage his own reputation. Several mistakes were made, the governor admitted in his BBC Today Programme Lecture. The Bank should have done more to prevent the disaster and should have tried much harder to make the case for a big recapitalisation of the banks before the critical moment in October 2008 when the entire global system teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. But a mea culpa it was not. In his lecture, King sought to guard his back against three separate charges. The first is that the Bank should have done more to \"lean against the wind\" in the years leading up to the start of the financial crisis in August 2007. The governor's critics say that he should have done more in these years to prick the bubbles in the City and the housing market and that a long period of steady, non-inflationary growth bred a lot of complacency on the Bank's monetary policy committee. Not so, according to King, because unlike the wild gyrations of the late 1980s \"this was a bust without a boom\". And since there was no boom, the Bank is absolved of responsibility for what happened next. The next charge against Threadneedle Street is that it became too narrow in its focus, seeing itself solely as a monetary policy institute rather than as a body which, along with the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority, had a responsibility for the stability of the banking system. King's approach here is to blame the Bank's low-key approach on Brown's decision within a month of the 1997 election to strip Threadneedle Street of its responsibility for banking supervision. At no stage before 2007, however, did King express any kind of desire to have the much bigger role in policing the City that he has now been handed by George Osborne; on the contrary, he was happy for the Bank to focus on ensuring that the government's inflation target was hit. Finally, there is the claim that the Bank failed to appreciate until it was too late the full magnitude of what was unfolding in the year that separated the run on Northern Rock in September 2007 and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Alistair Darling, the then chancellor of the exchequer, was frustrated by what he saw as King's over-academic approach to the crisis, with lectures on the perils of moral hazard when there should have been pre-emptive action to head off the looming downturn. In the summer of 2008, when Britain was in the early stages of a recession that would wipe more than 7% off national output, the Bank was fretting about the spike in inflation caused by rising oil prices. The fact that King and his colleagues did eventually act decisively to slash interest rates and bail out the banks does not mollify critics who say that it was a bit late in the day. Tonight's lecture comes at a pivotal time for the Bank. It has been handed vastly increased powers by the government to supervise the banks. It is presiding over an economy precariously poised between a double-dip recession and stubbornly high inflation. So King is eager to show that public confidence in his institution is merited. In reality, that trust is now more conditional than it was five years ago and the reputation of the Bank \u2013 and its governor \u2013 would be shredded in the event of a policy blunder that could be laid at Threadneedle Street's door.",

    "webTitle": "Sir Mervyn King admits: we did too little to warn of economic crisis", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Mervyn King has admitted that the Bank of England should have \"shouted from the rooftops\" its concerns about the looming disaster in the City as he warned that Britain's recovery from recession would be a long, slow process. The Bank's governor urged the coalition government to press ahead with reforms that would ringfence the high-street operations of banks from their speculative activities, after blaming the last Labour government for allowing the financial sector to take ever bigger gambles in the build-up to the financial crisis of 2007-08. King said that the decision by Gordon Brown to strip Threadneedle Street of its powers to regulate banks had left him unable to do more than \"issue reports and preach sermons\" as the financial system became \"increasingly fragile\". While accepting that \"no one could quite bring themselves to believe that in our modern financial system the biggest banks in the world could fall over\", the governor said the Bank had been aware of the precarious position of institutions that were lending too much. \"That isn't to say we were blind to what was going on\", he said in the BBC Today Programme Lecture, adding that for several years the Bank of England and other central banks had warned that the financial markets were underestimating the risks they were taking. \"So why, you might ask, did the Bank of England not do more to prevent the disaster? We should have. But the power to regulate banks had been taken away from us in 1997. Our power was limited to that of publishing reports and preaching sermons. And we did preach sermons about the risks.\" Looking back at the events since global financial markets froze up in August 2007, King said the Bank had not imagined the scale of the disaster that would occur when the risks it had identified crystallised. The crisis led to a three-day run on Northern Rock \u2013 the first on a British high street bank since the 1860s \u2013 and, a year later, the part-nationalisation of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. \"With the benefit of hindsight, we should have shouted from the rooftops that a system had been built in which banks were too important to fail, that banks had grown too quickly and borrowed too much, and that so-called 'light-touch' regulation hadn't prevented any of this,\" King said. \"And in the crisis, we tried, but should have tried harder, to persuade everyone of the need to recapitalise the banks sooner and by more. We should have preached that the lessons of history were being forgotten \u2013 because banking crises have happened before.\" The financial crisis led to the deepest slump in the UK output since the second world war, but King defended the Bank's handling of monetary policy in the pre-crash years. Recessions, he said, were supposed to follow booms and periods of high inflation: there seemed no reason in this case to expect the worst recession since the 1930s. \"In the five years before the onset of the crisis, across the industrialised world growth was steady and both unemployment and inflation were low and stable. Whether in this country, the United States or Europe, there was no unsustainable boom like that seen in the 1980s; this was a bust without a boom.\" The governor was critical of a banking system that had \"overextended\" itself, noting that, by the end of 2006, the banks had borrowed \u00a350 for every pound provided by their own shareholders. Problems were building in the banking system, he said, noting \"on all sides there was a failure of imagination to appreciate the scale of the fragilities and their potential consequences\". King added: \"In good times, banks took the benefits for their employees and shareholders, while in bad times the taxpayer bore the costs. For the banks, it was a case of heads I win, tails you \u2013 the taxpayer \u2013 lose.\" The governor expressed strong support for moves to ensure that banks are better regulated, operate under a framework that ensures they can fail without harming depositors, and are restructured so that day-to-day banking services are kept distinct from \"complex and potentially risky trading activities\". He said: \"For the sake of future generations, we too must be bold and decisive and, while the memory is fresh, learn the lessons from this crisis. Reform is essential. \"We don't build nuclear power stations in densely populated areas; nor should we allow essential banking services and risky investment banking activities to be carried out in the same 'too important to fail' bank. \"Last autumn, the independent commission on banking, chaired by Sir John Vickers and comprising some of our most brilliant bankers and economists, published recommendations on how to do this. It's vital that parliament legislates to enact these proposals sooner rather than later.\" Britain's economy is still more than 4% smaller than it was when activity peaked in the first quarter of 2008 and King said recovery was taking longer than expected. \"The present crisis is far from over, as events in the euro area illustrate weekly. Our own economy is still not back to health. Although inflation has fallen back in recent months, it is still too high. And despite efforts to stimulate the economy, the recovery is proving slower than we had hoped. It will come. But dealing with the consequences of our 'bad banking situation' is likely to be a long, slow process.\" Although concerted action by the world's leading nations prevented a full-scale financial collapse in late 2008, King said that the bank bailouts came too late to prevent the financial crisis spilling over into the world economy. \"The realisation of the true state of the banking system led to a collapse of confidence around the world and a deep global recession. Over 25m jobs disappeared worldwide. And unemployment in Britain rose by over a million. To many of you this will seem deeply unfair, and it is. I can understand why so many people are angry.\"",

And despite efforts to stimulate the economy, the recovery is proving slower than we had hoped. It will come. But dealing with the consequences of our 'bad banking situation' is likely to be a long, slow process.\"</p> <p>Although concerted action by the world's leading nations prevented a full-scale financial collapse in late 2008, King said that the bank bailouts came too late to prevent the financial crisis spilling over into the world economy.</p> <p>\"The realisation of the true state of the banking system led to a collapse of confidence around the world and a deep global recession. Over 25m jobs disappeared worldwide. And unemployment in Britain rose by over a million. To many of you this will seem deeply unfair, and it is. I can understand why so many people are angry.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Former MG Rover workers are to be rewarded with compensation of just \u00a33 each following a seven-year battle for redundancy payments in the wake of the collapse of Britain's last major carmaker. News of the tiny payouts was announced to campaigners at a meeting on Monday and has led to calls for personal donations to the workers' compensation fund from the so-called Phoenix Four \u2013 John Towers, Nick Stephenson, John Edwards and Peter Beale \u2013 the businessmen who bought the company for \u00a310 in 2000 and then paid themselves and managing director Kevin Howe a total of \u00a342m. Carl Chinn, a trustee of the former employees' fund, said: \"I hope they will search their conscience to see if they can find the goodwill to help those who have lost so much. But as they have been ignoring my calls for four or five years, I'm not holding out much hope.\" Chinn said a request for contributions had been put to representatives of the quartet, who last May were disqualified from working as company directors in Britain for a total of 19 years. A spokesman for the four said: \"All we would want to say is that the request has been noted.\" Former Longbridge employee Oliver Thomas, of the Justice for Rover Workers group, said: \"[The Phoenix Four and Howe] have ignored pleas from Carl Chinn, numerous MPs, the archbishop of York and myself to end this matter with a contribution already, so I've limited hope this time around.\" MG Rover workers and campaigners had been hoping for \u00a310m-30m to be paid into the trust fund following the liquidation of assets from within the Phoenix group of companies that owned MG Rover and its businesses. Shortly after Rover's 2005 collapse, Towers said: \"What we are trying to do is place a fortune into the benefit of all of the employees. We've launched the employee trust ... \"That's got gross assets in excess of \u00a350m. There are clearly creditors to pay ... but I'm very confident it will have millions of pounds available for those employees.\" However, the fund has ended up with just over \u00a322,000 in its coffers, which it needs to share among approximately 6,500 workers who lost their jobs. Hopes of securing a further \u00a312.5m have just been dashed in the high court, which ruled that MG Rover's former parent Phoenix Venture Holdings was not entitled to more information about monies paid to creditor HBOS by administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2005. A spokesman for Lloyds Banking Group, the part-taxpayer-owned bank that now owns HBOS, said: \"As a major lender to MG Rover we made losses from its collapse. We therefore have a duty to our shareholders, including the taxpayer, to try to minimise these losses. Along with other creditors, we are seeking to do this through the normal recoveries process.\" A final pot of cash containing \u00a323m from within a company called MG Rover Capital is currently frozen by the pensions regulator, which has until the end of this year to state whether it will make a claim. Should the funds be released, the money will be split between shareholders of the company, which is 51% owned by HBOS and 49% by Phoenix Venture Holdings directors. A spokesman for the Phoenix Four declined to say if the businessmen would give the windfall to former workers, should they receive their \u00a311m share. Campaigners said that Howe, who has not faced official sanction, should also contribute to the compensation fund. While his old colleagues were being barred from acting as company directors last year, the carmaker's former managing director was being registered as a member of a limited liability partnership called The Exit Partnership \u2013 a role that encompasses almost identical responsibilities and restrictions to a director of a company. He is now understood to be working in the US. When Phoenix acquired Rover in May 2000, they did so with the enthusiastic backing of the then Labour government as well as jubilant Rover workers who hailed Towers as he arrived at the Longbridge plant in a Rover 75, chanting: \"There's only one John Towers\". The then industry secretary Stephen Byers was also cheered by MPs when he announced the deal.",

      "bodyText": "Rising unemployment and plunging business confidence in the euro area revealed the increasingly fragile state of the region's economy on Wednesday, as voters in France and Greece prepare to deliver their verdict on austerity in Sunday elections. Official figures showed that unemployment across the 17-member single currency zone increased by 169,000 in March, for the 11th consecutive month, to hit 17.37m. The unemployment rate was 10.9%, the highest level in its history. Even in Germany, which has so far largely escaped unscathed from the downturn sweep of the labour market, unemployment began to tick up in March, though it remained at just 5.6% of the workforce. There was also evidence that businesses are being hit by what many analysts expect to be a eurozone-wide recession. The manufacturing PMI for the zone in April \u2013 a measure of confidence among businesses \u2013 registered a sharp decline, from 47.7 to 45.9, the lowest since June 2009, and well below the 50 mark which signals growth. The sharpest declines were seen in Italy and Spain. But the PMI reading for Germany also slipped, to a 33-month low of 46.2, suggesting that Europe's largest economy is being dragged into the malaise that is afflicting its austerity-ravaged neighbours. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: \"The latest data on the state of the eurozone labour market and manufacturing sector underline the enormity of the challenge facing policymakers to respond the growing calls for growth across the region.\" Neil Mellor, currency strategist at BNY Mellon, said: \"The bottom line is, Europe needs growth, there is no growth, and austerity may be part of the answer, but not without demand.\" As Lucas Papademos, Greece's technocratic prime minister, who was drafted in at the height of the country's sovereign debt crisis, prepared to bow out and return to teaching at Harvard after Sunday's elections, more than one in five of the Greek workforce \u2013 21.7% \u2013 are unemployed. Greece's figures date from January, the most recent Europe's statistical agency could collect, so the situation may even have worsened. In Spain, meanwhile, focus of the latest wave of market panic about the future of the single currency, unemployment was at 24.1% in March, while in Portugal, it was 15.3%. In total, eurozone unemployment has increased by 1.68m in the past 12 months. Financial markets are braced for a rocky ride next week if voters in France and Greece strike a blow against the centrally-imposed deficit targets that have been at the heart of Europe's response to the debt crisis over the past two years. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the socialist candidate and frontrunner for the French presidency, has said he wants to negotiate a package of pro-growth measures alongside the \"fiscal compact\" that allows Brussels to enforce strict deficit limits on eurozone member countries. Sony Kapoor, of the Brussels-based thinktank Re-Define, said yesterday's data underlined the need for a new agreement among the eurozone's leaders about how to restore growth. \"The EU needs a growth compact more than anything else in order to stem the downward spiral of falling growth, rising unemployment and weakening banking systems that has currently taken hold,\" he said. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, last week added his voice to those warning that spending cuts are starting to undermine growth in the eurozone, saying that austerity is, \"starting to reverberate its contractionary effects\". The ECB's governing council will gather in Barcelona today, for one of the two meetings a year it holds in a member-state away from its Frankfurt base. Spanish police have laid on extra protection for the meeting, fearing that the ECB could become the focus of social unrest about rising unemployment. Christel Aranda-Hassel, director of European economics at Credit Suisse, said the darkening economic outlook could force the ECB to cut interest rates in the coming months. \"If the ECB prepares the ground for a June cut, it would mean that under Draghi's leadership the ECB has not only become more pragmatic but is also becoming more pro-active,\" she said. With polls in Greece suggesting the parties that signed up to the country's latest bailout deal will be unable to form a majority government after Sunday's election, political momentum appears to be building across the eurozone against austerity. Young workers are continuing to be disproportionately hit by the sharp rise in joblessness, Wednesday's figures showed, with the unemployment rate for the under-25s standing at 22.1% for the eurozone as a whole. However, that average masks wide variations between countries, with 7.9% of young German workers unemployed, compared with more than half of under-25s in Greece and Spain. Kapoor said: \"With catastrophic unemployment levels in Spain, Portugal and Greece that are still rising, the real question is, how long before the social fabric gives way?\" The deteriorating labour market in the eurozone underlined the contrast between the economic fortunes of Europe and the US, where unemployment has started to fall in recent months, and recent business surveys have suggested rising confidence. US firms hired an extra 119,000 workers in April, according to a survey by payroll provider ADP, which gives an early indication of what official figures are likely to show on Friday. Graham Turner, of GFC Economics, said America's ability to sell its exports into fast-growing developing markets had helped it to \"decouple\" from the struggling eurozone. \"The euro was created to underpin the single market, which was meant to provide an unrivalled 'free trade' zone to foster faster economic expansion. Instead, the aggressive expansion of free trade agreements on a bilateral basis has put the US in the driving seat as developing countries continue to increase their share of world imports.",

    "webTitle": "Argos sales tumble but Home Retail sticks with catalogue format", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of Argos has dismissed claims that the chain's catalogue-showroom business model is dying as he announced a collapse in annual profits. Shares in Argos's parent Home Retail tumbled 14%, wiping \u00a3100m off the value of the business, after the company unveiled profits down 60% to \u00a3102m and said it would not pay a final dividend. As recently as 2008 the group, which also owns Homebase, was making \u00a3426m. Some analysts, who have been calling for a major programme of store closures, were furious the group had not announced a radical shakeup to improve the performance of Argos's stores. Home Retail's embattled chief executive, Terry Duddy, blamed Argos's problems on the economic downturn, which he says has disproportionately affected its shoppers. The majority of Argos customers come from the mass-market C2 and D socio-economic groups, who have borne the brunt of the downturn, he said: \"We have to keep moving and getting better but the major issue here is the market and economy,\" said Duddy. Like-for-like sales, which exclude any gains made from store openings and expansions, fell nearly 9% at Argos in the year to 25 February, as demand in important sales areas such as TVs, stereos and video game consoles fell away. The retailer said the consumer electronics market had shrunk by 20% during the year. The shares, which have lost more than half their value over the last year, closed down 14.7p at 86.30p. Analysts argue that Argos, which generates two-thirds of group sales, is being crushed by structural change as the products it sells increasingly move online. They say Argos is being outgunned by internet rivals such as Amazon as well as supermarkets, which now offer similar \"click and collect\" services. They fear it risks being saddled with too many stores in the future and believe it must act; at the moment the group's total lease commitments add up to \u00a33.3bn. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said the catalogue-showroom format had \"died a painful death\" everywhere else in the world barring the UK. \"In the US, the discount stores such as Walmart and the online giants like Amazon destroyed long ago the convenience and range advantage of the catalogue showroom. Is it only a matter of time before the same pressures prevail in the UK?\". Investors had not expected such a \"brutal\" move on the dividend, Bubb added. Total sales at Home Retail finished down 6% at \u00a35.5bn in the year to 25 February with both chains misfiring: operating profits at Argos were down 57% at \u00a394.2m and halved at sister chain Homebase to \u00a322.8m. Despite the dismal performance, Duddy insisted it would not announce an \"en masse store closure programme in the near future\". He said only seven of Argos's 750 stores were not making a profit and that nearly 90% of its sales involve a store at some point. \"It would not make any sense to close stores that are currently making us money.\" If the retailer closed its 100 least profitable stores it would still be on the hook for rent liabilities of \u00a3125m, making a \"significant store reduction programme financially unattractive,\" Duddy added. Instead, the firm is only likely to close 10 Argos stores this year and will also look to strike better deals with landlords. \"We have got 300 or so stores coming up for lease renewal or lease break over the next five years or so. Each of those stores, at the point the lease renewal comes up, will be reviewed,\" he said. Analysts were frustrated that Argos's new managing director John Walden did not present his proposals for revitalising the business. He joined last month but has since drafted in consultants OC&amp;C to help him. Duddy said Walden, a former Sears and Best Buy executive, had arrived with \"ideas\" but not a plan and would report back in the autumn. Plans already in the pipeline included launching a revamped Argos website before Christmas. It will also be expanding its product offering, with 24,000 lines being made available in its spring/summer catalogue and an additional 9,000 online-only products. Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan questioned the need to draft in consultants: \"Why don't management decide what to do? We believe that Argos will need a significant store closure programme as it shifts towards clicks, rather than bricks; it will need to match Amazon on price; and it will probably need a rescue rights issue to finance change.\"",

A compensation survey by Mercer found US employers planned average increase in base pay of 3% in 2012.

      "bodyText": "America's top bosses have handed themselves double-digit pay rises for the second year in a row, according to interim figures from the most comprehensive survey of CEO pay. The Guardian's exclusive first look at the research by GMI Ratings reveals that rising share prices helped drive a 15% pay hike for the average US CEO in 2011, with the average compensation package hitting $5.8m. It comes on the back of a 28% pay rise the year before. The two years of double-digit growth follow two years of decline in 2008 and 2009. The boom time for chief executives contrasts sharply with the wider economy, where average wages have been little better than flat. A compensation survey by Mercer found US employers planned average increase in base pay of 3% in 2012. Inflation is about 2.7%. Last year, the census bureau reported that the income of the typical American family had dropped for the third year in a row. The median family income in 2010 was $49.445, 7.1% below its 1999 peak and when adjusted for inflation roughly at levels last seen in 1996. The news comes as shareholders have begun to challenge outsized pay deals. Last month, Citigroup shareholders voted against the bank's plans to award chief executive Vikram Pandit $14.9m in compensation, including his first bonus since the bank's near-collapse in 2007. GMI's half-year report looked at the 2011 pay deals for CEOs at 817 companies. The full analysis of 3,000 firms will be available at the end of the year, so it is still to early to tell exactly how lucrative 2011 was, but the interim figures suggest another golden year for top bosses. The survey also found: \u2022 CEOs in the top 500 companies, enjoyed, on average, total realised compensation of $12.1m \u2022 Annual salary has risen just 3% this year on average compared to 18% last year. But compensation from share schemes has soared. \u2022 The 10 highest paid CEOs made about 78% of their compensation through stock options and other share sales. \u2022 The highest paid CEO so far is Michael Johnson of direct marketing firm Herbalife, who raked in $89,419,474 in 2011. \u2022 Three of the 10 highest paid CEOs thus far in 2012 are from the software industry. Greg Ruel, the report's author, said overall average salaries had increased only marginally in 2012, but CEOs were now reaping the benefit of share awards they were granted in leaner times. As the stock markets have bounced back, they have made fortunes. \"Last year we saw a return to cash as wages went up. This year, we are seeing the benefit of equities,\" he said. \"The stock markets have risen. It may not feel like that to the rest of us, but if you own thousands of shares, a few bucks on the share price can make a huge difference.\" Michael Johnson of Herbalife exercised more than 1.8m stock options in 2011 for a profit of almost $77m. His base salary was $1.23m. Many of these options were awarded between 2003 and 2005, when Herbalife's shares traded below $10. They now trade for over $70. Samuel Palmisano, CEO of IBM, and Edward Breen, CEO of Tyco, each received realized compensation of about $63m, mostly from equity profits. Last year, chief executive pay roared back after two years of stagnation and decline. GNI's annual survey found pay hikes of between 27 and 40%. Ruel said that while he expected that CEO pay would boom again this year, he also believed shareholders would make their voice heard. Newly introduced \"say on pay\" rules give shareholders a chance to voice their concern at outsized pay deals. Although the votes are non-binding Citigroup has already said it will amend its pay deal with Pandit. \"I think shareholders are finding their voice,\" said Ruel.",

      "bodyText": "Taxes on bars and pubs are worsening the north-south divide, the boss of the country's biggest pub chain said on Wednesday. JD Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin warned that high taxes mean future pub expansion will slow, creating fewer jobs. New pubs are less likely to be opened in poorer areas because taxes on drinks are disproportionately hitting these areas, he said. \"The economic impact of adding tax to beer - say 10 pence on a pint \u2013 has more impact in less affluent areas where a pint costs \u00a31.90 than in places where it costs \u00a33.\" He revealed that the company's tax bill would hit \u00a3500m next year, up \u00a350m, or 11% on 2011. The business has cut the number of new pubs it will open in the coming year from 50 to between 20 to 30, creating 3,000 jobs, but fewer than initially hoped. In a statement the pub chain said: \"The overall level of taxes have greater economic effect in less affluent parts of the UK. \"The result is that the majority of prominent pub and catering companies are investing in the southern part of the UK and in major towns and city centres elsewhere, contributing to serious economic problems for many high streets in Britain and Northern Ireland.\" The company saw like-for-like sales between January and April up 2% compared with the same period a year earlier. It opened 29 new pubs, and closed two of its 850-strong chain, in the last nine months and say they plan to open between 20 and 30 pubs over the next year \u2013 nearly half the number pledged previously. Publishing a detailed breakdown of its tax bill, the company revealed it paid \u00a3250.1m in the first half of this year, compared with \u00a3225.7m during the same six months a year earlier. The bill \u2013 which included income tax and national insurance contributions paid by employees \u2013 saw VAT top its contributions, handing over \u00a3115.6m compared with \u00a395.1m last year, up 21.5%. It spent \u00a31.2m on a new carbon tax and the only fall in contributions was in corporation tax, which fell from \u00a311.1m in 2010/11 to \u00a39m. Martin has railed against the government over levies on pubs and bars in the past. He has turned his ire on supermarkets repeatedly, in particular over VAT. In Wednesday's statement, the company said: \"The extra taxes on fruit/slot machines and the late-night levy are not applicable to supermarkets, so the tax disparity between supermarkets and pubs has been further increased.\" It added: \"We have also created approximately 3,000 jobs, but all of the economic benefits of our expansion are currently being levied by the government as taxes - an unsustainable situation.\" The government is set to introduce the late-night levy in October, which could be as high as \u00a34,440 a year per bar. It has faced huge opposition from publicans, but police say it is vital to fund the extra costs associated with late-night antisocial behaviour. Home Office minister Lord Henley said recently: \"Where there is a vibrant late-night economy, with premises remaining open into the early hours, then the local authority should have the flexibility to charge for a contribution towards any extra policing that this generates.\" The company is expected to make a full-year pretax profit of \u00a367.4m, on sales of \u00a31.2bn. The company said: \"We continue to be slightly more cautious about the potential outcome for the current financial year,\" Shares in JD Wetherspoon were down 1.3p to 407.1p.",

Now, with the shares priced almost two-thirds cheaper, the company can't even afford to give its owners a final dividend. This column asked six months ago whether that share buy-back was one of the world's worst and the question has now been answered. Naturally, departing chairman Oliver Stocken didn't bother to explain today why he sanctioned a distribution of almost half the company's cash resources via a voguish share buy-back in preference to a plain-vanilla special dividend. In a rational world, boards announcing buy-backs would have to set out their reasoning at the time with reference to the price paid, as Terry Smith, chief executive of Tullett Prebon, has long argued. At Home Retail there was a long list of reasons to be cautious in 2010-2011: the group's return on capital had fallen for three years in a row, so had operating profits and so had Argos' like-for-like sales. If Stocken and chief executive Duddy thought the worst had past and thus buying shares was a sensible way to use excess capital, they were grossly mistaken. Today's figures reveal a thumping 60% collapse in \"benchmark\" pre-tax profits to \u00a3102m and a 9% fall in same-store sales at Argos. Stocken is leaving shareholders with the thought that dividends in future will be set \"at a level which is sustainable and which reflects the trading prospects and financial position of the group.\" What he means is the dividend ain't coming back at the old level. The company says it is \"not uncomfortable\" with forecasts that profits will fall again this year to \u00a375m. The shares are down 13% today, partly because the City can't detect a detailed plan to revive Argos. A new managing director of the chain has been recruited but the first move made by John Walden, fresh from a spell as a management consultant, has been to appoint other management consultants, which presumably means the fightback starts next year. Mass closures of stores have been ruled out since all but seven of the 748 Argos units are contributing a profit. Instead, the best idea seems to be to use the expiry of 230 leases at Argos over the next five years as an opportunity to demand lower rents from landlords. That plan should stand a reasonable chance of success. One might even call it a disciplined approach.

That's worrying enough in itself: if the economy is to re-tool itself for exporting to fast-growing markets in the developing world, and create new industries to drive growth as the financial services sector shrinks, it will require substantial investment. Optimists often suggest larger firms can borrow from the bond markets, so that a decline in overall bank lending to business shouldn't be too much of a concern. But the Bank's analysis shows that in each of the past three months, the new debt raised has been more than outweighed by the decline in loans. It's not just the headline volume of lending that should worry the Treasury either: the details of the Bank's figures show that small businesses are paying the highest price for the banks' caution. Michael Saunders, of Citigroup, points out that there was a differential of close to 2% \u2013 1.83% \u2013 in March between the interest rate being charged on larger loans of more than \u00a320m (ie those to big firms) and small ones of \u00a31m or less. That compares with an average spread of just 0.46% between 2004 and 2007. And it fails to take into account the other costs many small firms complain they're facing from their banks, such as rocketing overdraft fees and tighter lending conditions. George Osborne's policy of credit easing \u2013 billed as a radical way of using the government's financial muscle to lower the cost of loans to small firms \u2013 took six months to put in place, and is meant to cut the interest rates on small business loans by up to 0.5%. But these latest figures suggest the banking sector is still simply not functioning in supplying businesses with credit. That is bound to hamper recovery \u2013 as Saunders puts it, \"the poor state of credit availability is an extra hurdle for the UK, which already faces an array of headwinds from private deleveraging, fiscal drag and the EMU crisis.\" Credit e asing only got under way just before the budget, so it's too soon to see whether it's having an effect; but given that we've now sunk back into recession, it's surely time to think about whether more radical action \u2013 such as a state-backed British investment bank \u2013 is needed.",

But the Bank's analysis shows that in each of the past three months, the new debt raised has been more than outweighed by the decline in loans.</p> <p>It's not just the headline volume of lending that should worry the Treasury either: the details of the Bank's figures show that small businesses are paying the highest price for the banks' caution.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, of Citigroup, points out that there was a differential of close to 2% \u2013 1.83% \u2013 in March between the interest rate being charged on larger loans of more than \u00a320m (ie those to big firms) and small ones of \u00a31m or less. That compares with an average spread of just 0.46% between 2004 and 2007. And it fails to take into account the other costs many small firms complain they're facing from their banks, such as rocketing overdraft fees and tighter lending conditions.</p> <p>George Osborne's policy of credit easing \u2013 billed as a radical way of using the government's financial muscle to lower the cost of loans to small firms \u2013 took six months to put in place, and is meant to cut the interest rates on small business loans by up to 0.5%.</p> <p>But these latest figures suggest the banking sector is still simply not functioning in supplying businesses with credit. That is bound to hamper recovery \u2013 as Saunders puts it, \"the poor state of credit availability is an extra hurdle for the UK, which already faces an array of headwinds from private deleveraging, fiscal drag and the EMU crisis.\"</p> <p>Credit e</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-389546131\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2012/5/2/1335962388237/Net-funds-raised-by-UK-bu-001.jpg\" alt=\"Net funds raised by UK businesses\" width=\"460\" height=\"325\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Net funds raised by UK businesses.

      "bodyText": "UK construction maintained its 16-month recovery last month, according to financial data provider Markit, despite official data showing that the sector experienced steep falls in output at the start of the year. The Markit/Cips purchasing managers index (PMI) reported strong new orders and a rise in employment during April as growth fell back only marginally to 55.8 in April from 56.7 in the previous month. Markit data shows much of the boost to output came from an upsurge in commercial building and civil engineering during the spring which is expected to continue through the summer months. Commercial building expanded by 57.7 while civil engineering activity hit 56.5. However, much of this activity is in London and the south-east where the Olympics, Crossrail and the development of King's Cross are in full swing while projects like the Westfield shopping centre in Bradford remain on the drawing board. Economists are divided over the conflicting data, with some believing the Office for National Statistics is overly gloomy while others argue the Markit data fails to pick up the downturn affecting smaller firms in the north and west. House building is a high profile area that has also caused controversy.

      "bodyText": "The trend for South American nations to reclaim privatised energy businesses has strengthened after Bolivia's president Evo Morales said he planned to seize control of the main power grid from a Spanish-owned company. The move is a blow to Red El\u00e9ctrica Corporacii\u00f3n, which has operated most of Bolivia's electricity distribution since the grid was privatised 15 years ago. It follows Argentina's controversial move last month to take control of the country's oil company, YPF, from the Spanish energy company Repsol, which had a majority interest. Spain's ambassador to La Paz expressed alarm that another overseas Spanish asset was effectively being seized. He said the electric grid takeover \"is sending a negative message that generates distrust\". Morales chose to press ahead with the move on May Day, the international labour day, by ordering troops to occupy the company's installations. Red El\u00e9ctrica is the sole operator of the transmission grid in Spain, and the Spanish government holds a 20% stake in the company. Morales did not say how much the company would be compensated, but the nationalisation decree says the state would negotiate a compensation fee. Morales said only $81m (\u00a349.9m) had been invested in Bolivia's power grid since it was privatised in 1997. The government, meanwhile, \"invested $220m in generation and others profited. For that reason, brothers and sisters, we have decided to nationalise electricity transmission,\" he said. Argentina president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner also blamed a lack of investment by Repsol for her decision to nationalise the oil companies assets. Bolivian soldiers peacefully took over the company's offices in the central city of Cochabamba, hanging Bolivia's flag across its entry. Red El\u00e9ctrica had no immediate comment. The company owned 74% of Bolivia's electrical transmission network, or 1,720 miles of high voltage lines. Two years ago, on May Day, Morales' government took control of most of Bolivia's electrical generation, nationalising its main hydroelectric plants. Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, has moved to put energy, water and telecommunications under state control. But analyst Jo\u00e3o de Castro Neves of the Eurasia Group said the president has been far more pragmatic and less radical than the leftist leaders of Venezuela or Argentina. \"He knows his limits,\" Castro Neves said. \"The Bolivian state doesn't have the capacity to take over all these sectors, including mining, and maintain the high levels of investment they need.\" He noted that Morales still has not come to terms for taking over several small mines whose nationalisation he announced last May Day. Bolivia's government also has not been able to negotiate compensation for the power plants taken from GDF Suez of France and Britain's Rurelec. In his first year in office in 2006, Morales announced he was \"nationalising\" the oil and gas sector. He began extracting concessions from multinational energy companies, renegotiating contracts to give Bolivians greater control of and a bigger share of profits from the natural gas industry, the country's biggest ahead of mining. In 2008, he used May Day to announce the completion of the nationalisation of Bolivia's leading telecommunications company, Entel, from Telecom Italia. The nationalisations have not saved Morales from widespread criticism by Bolivians upset over rising consumer prices, lower domestic oil production and discontent over government plans to build a highway through a lowlands nature preserve inhabited by Indians. Morales' approval rating is down to about 40% from 69% when he began his second term in January 2010.",

The index has remained below 50, the level indicating expansion, since October. The bank's purchasing manager' index (PMI) reported that new export orders rose at a \"fractional rate\".
