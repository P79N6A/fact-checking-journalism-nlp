      "bodyText": "Mission accomplished? Assessing the capital health of the UK\u2019s banks is a neverending task, of course, but Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, seems pleased with the current state of affairs. \u201cUK banks are now significantly more resilient than before the global financial crisis,\u201d he declared. Lending to the real economy could continue even if severe stresses materialise. The UK banking system is \u201cwithin sight\u201d of the optimal level of capital. The big seven lenders passed their stress tests, though it was a narrow squeak for Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered. None will have to raise more capital as a result of the tests. Even a hike in the new counter-cyclical capital buffer, designed to ensure credit keeps flowing when economic storms arrive, \u201cwill not, in itself, change the overall capital requirements for UK banks\u201d. But the best bit from the banks\u2019 point of view was Carney\u2019s clear message that fresh capital demands were not on the agenda: \u201cAll should be clear, there is no new wave of capital regulation coming,\u201d he said. \u201cOur objective has never been to raise capital without limit. Or by stealth.\u201d Thus the share prices of most banks rose strongly. It is indeed excellent news that the governor is so confident. Even on much-debated risks such as the surge in buy-to-let lending in the UK, Threadneedle Street seems relatively relaxed. The Prudential Regulation Authority unit will examine the buy-to-let market but no curbs on lending were announced on Tuesday. Here\u2019s the nagging doubt: in the aftermath of the 2007-09 crisis, regulators seemed determined to set banks\u2019 capital thresholds far higher than is now deemed acceptable. The UK\u2019s Vickers commission and the international Basel committee spoke of core equity ratios of 18%. In the event, the bank has settled on 11%. Carney, to be fair, gave a full explanation. First, capital is better designed these days \u2013 bondholders in the biggest banks can be forced to take pain in a crisis, for example. Second, \u201cforward-looking\u201d regulators are making better judgments on risks. Third, those counter-cyclical buffers can be flexed up and down as conditions require. The arguments all sound plausible, but 18% to 11% is a mighty leap downwards. Perhaps it was necessary to avoid \u201cthe stability of the graveyard\u201d, meaning banks so over-capitalised that they take too few risks. But perhaps more alarmingly, today\u2019s central bankers just have complete faith in their ability to spot dangers. BlueCrest is hedging its bets no more \u201cSo long, clients, you\u2019ve been holding us back with your over-cautious approach to risk; we\u2019ll make loads more money without you.\u201d Naturally, this was not how Mike Platt, founder and boss of BlueCrest, one of the UK\u2019s leading hedge fund managers, told his external investors that their $8bn of funds were no longer wanted. He is a polite billionaire and he thanked them for their custom. But the logic of why BlueCrest, one of the world\u2019s largest hedge funds, is turning itself into a private partnership is as summarised. Platt calculates that BlueCrest will be better off by dropping its passengers and managing only its own partners\u2019 fortunes. \u201cThe new model provides the opportunity to create significant value for our partners, our traders and our staff, due to a step-change in profitability,\u201d he said. On the face of it, the decision seems bizarre. Managing $8bn produces $160m of revenue when you charge a basic fee of 2%. BlueCrest\u2019s assets under management have fallen in recent years, but you can still hire a lot of traders and computers for that money. The problem, it seems, is that the clients don\u2019t share BlueCrest\u2019s appetite for backing its trading positions with debt and the hedge fund\u2019s trading strategy seems to depend on leverage to produce decent returns, at least in today\u2019s low interest rate world. For the past three years, BlueCrest\u2019s main fund has returned 4% on average, which doesn\u2019t excite. Memories of the 45% BlueCrest achieved in 2009 have faded. In liberated form, the BlueCrest partners can bet their own money as aggressively as they wish and try to recapture past glories. Call it a tale of the times: institutions have become more careful and the hedgies, or some of them, pine for the old days. In the circumstances, divorce does indeed seem the best option. Staley on the starting blocks at Barclays When Jes Staley, new chief executive of Barclays, addresses staff for the first time on Wednesday he should make one thing clear: the giant plastic blocks in the head office foyer, labelled \u201crespect\u201d and \u201cintegrity\u201d and so on, are staying put. Staley has been caricatured, almost certainly unfairly, as the man who will cut former chief Antony Jenkins\u2019s \u201cpurpose and values\u201d moralising \u2013 embodied by the blocks \u2013 and get back to the job of making money for Barclays shareholders. But it would be highly dangerous if traders fell for such misleading pre-publicity. Keep the plastic. The blocks aren\u2019t pretty but removal would send the wrong message.",

Staley, who told staff he was joining with \u201cexcitement and optimism for the future\u201d, is being bought out of bonuses from one of his previous employers, US bank JP Morgan. Barclays had said it expected this to cost about \u00a31.9m when his appointment was announced a month ago although the bill has now risen to more than \u00a32m because of the rise in the value of JP Morgan\u2019s shares. The US banker is scheduled to address Barclays staff at the bank\u2019s headquarters in Canary Wharf, London, on Wednesday when he is expected to set out his hopes and ambitions as chief executive following the ousting of his predecessor Antony Jenkins was ousted in July. Staley benefited from a rise in Barclays shares on his first day following the result of annual stress tests at the Bank of England. The bank was the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, up 4.6% at 233p, and back at the level Staley spent \u00a36.4m buying shares after his appointment on 28 October. Barclays is paying him up to \u00a38.25m a year \u2013 before the buyout from JP Morgan \u2013 and taking on the cost of relocating him and his family from the US. According to his contract \u2013 dated the day his appointment was confirmed \u2013 the bank will pay his accommodation expenses for 90 days and provide him with advisers to help him find a suitable home in the UK. Barclays will cover the cost of moving personal items that fit into a 12-metre (40ft) container but has ruled out covering the removal costs of specialist items such as wine or pianos. Boats are also excluded which may be of interest to Staley who owns a luxury 28-metre wenge wood yacht. The 58-year-old, who spent most of his career at JP Morgan before leaving three years ago to join a hedge fund, is also able to travel first class from the US, with his family. He was close to being appointed to the top Barclays role in 2012 when Jenkins was named to replace Bob Diamond, who left in the fallout from the Libor rigging crisis. But as a result of the political mood at the time, Barclays picked insider Jenkins. Staley is also being given advice on applying for work visas and fees associated with filing tax returns. His contract shows that he is expected to abide by the values set out by his predecessor in a mission statement and emblazoned on five huge perspex blocks that Jenkins had installed in Barclays\u2019 headquarters.

    "webTitle": "Stress tests: Bank of England flags up buy-to-let concerns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England is scrutinising the terms under which mortgages are being granted to buy-to-let landlords as it decides whether to take action to cool the fast-growing market. The Bank\u2019s latest warning to landlords came in a list of risks to the financial system, as Threadneedle Street put banks on notice thatthey could be forced to hold a special capital cushion of up to \u00a310bn to guard against any economic downturn. On what analysts had dubbed \u201csuper Tuesday\u201d for the banking sector, the Bank announced the results of its \u201cstress tests\u201d which found that Standard Chartered and bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland had the weakest financial positions. But in a shift in policy, Threadneedle Street said the banking system had moved out of the post-crisis phase and it was \u201cactively considering\u201d whether banks should start to put capital aside in anticipation of future downturns. The Bank has been warning for many months that it is concerned about the buy-to-let mortgage market. While it did not take immediate action to cool this sector \u2013 in which lending has risen 10% in the first nine months of the year compared with 0.4% in owner-occupied properties \u2013 it said it was reviewing the lending criteria adopted by firms and stands \u201cready to take action\u201d. It said it was monitoring the effect of the extra 3% stamp duty announced last week by George Osborne in his autumn statement and provided a detailed analysis of the fallout on landlords from any interest rate rise. The Bank found that if mortgage rates were to increase by three percentage points, nearly 60% of buy-to-let customers could run into repayment difficulties while only 4% of homeowners would be likely to experience similar pain. The announcement on bank capital was the first signal from Threadneedle Street that it could use new so-called countercyclical buffers in response to the 2008 banking crisis when banks ran down their capital before the economic downturn. Banks could be ordered to make use of profitable periods to build up additional safety funds. The move could push up lending rates without a rise in the Bank\u2019s 0.5% interest rate. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said: \u201cIn the process of increasing capital requirements there will be cost passed on to borrowers that will have an impact on demand and some impact on inflation.\u201d But the Bank played down the impact as knocking 0.1 percentage points off GDP over three years and increasing the cost of bank funding for loans by 0.05 percentage points. The Bank will announce in March whether it intends to put countercyclical buffers in place and each bank\u2019s current capital will be assessed between now and then. John Thanassoulis, professor of finance economics at Warwick Business School, said the move could \u201cbe in effect tightening monetary policy, which is not good for the UK with inflation so subdued\u201d. Shares in UK banks rose as Carney scotched lenders\u2019 concerns that policymakers would keep increasing their demands for capital \u2013 which is now 10 times greater than before the crisis. Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and RBS were among the 10 biggest risers on Tuesday. The half-yearly assessment of risks to the system \u2013 which warned that the global economic environment was challenging \u2013 was published alongside heath checks on seven major lenders. The Bank said it was not concerned about the strength of the banking system, seven years on from the crisis. \u201cThe global environment is unforgiving and the legacy of the crisis means private and public balance sheets remain stretched. This calls for resilience not fatalism. Today we have reaffirmed the strength of our banks in the face of these risks,\u201d Carney said. The Bank subjected seven major lenders to a hypothetical scenario that involved a dramatic slowdown in the Chinese economy, prolonged deflation, a reduction in interest rates to zero and a huge increase in costs for fines and legal bills of \u00a340bn. The test found that profits would fall more than they had done during the 2008 banking crisis \u2013 by \u00a3100bn by the low point of the hypothetical scenario in 2016 \u2013 but capital cushions remained strong enough to withstand the downturn while increasing credit to the economy by 10%. While RBS and Standard Chartered both passed the overall thresholds set by the Bank, they did not meet the policymakers\u2019 judgment-based assessment of their capital strength. But neither was forced to change its plans as they had already taken steps to improve their financial position: RBS by selling businesses including Citizens in the US and Standard Chartered by embarking on a \u00a33.3bn cash call. The other lenders tested in the second annual assessment of financial health were HSBC, Barclays, Nationwide, Santander UK andLloyds. Thanassoulissaid: \u201cWhat the latest stress tests show is that we are out of the financial crisis \u2013 as all of the banks have passed \u2013 although two came close to not passing the test: Standard Chartered and Royal Bank of Scotland.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Swadlincote, a market town in south Derbyshire, has won \u00a31m from Sainsbury\u2019s to invest in finding ways to halve household food waste. The supermarket will work with community groups and the local council next year to test ideas such as growing mushrooms in used coffee grounds, using artificial \u201cnoses\u201d that detect whether food is safe to eat and introducing community cook-ups to find new ways of using unwanted food. Families in Swadlincote could save a collective \u00a31.2m a year by reducing food waste, Sainsbury\u2019s said, and local people would contribute to a book designed to inspire other places to adopt some of the ideas. The town beat 189 rival towns and cities that applied to take part in the trial. Sainsbury\u2019s plans to spend \u00a310m over the next five years to promote similar schemes. Mike Coupe, the chief executive, said: \u201cFood waste is one of society\u2019s biggest environmental issues at the moment and there is a genuine passion across the UK to tackle it.\u201d The move comes as supermarkets face increasing pressure to tackle food waste. Last week campaigners dumped skips full of waste food outside the headquarters of Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco and delivered a petition signed by more than 190,000 people urging them to reduce waste in their supply chains. The Stop the Rot campaign group wants supermarkets to cut waste at stores and factories by at least 30% by 2025. It is also calling for funds to measure food waste on farms by 2018, so targets can be set for that too. The campaign is backed by celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall who highlighted supermarket waste in his BBC show Hugh\u2019s War on Waste last month. Just over 1% of food wasted in the UK \u2013 200,000 tonnes \u2013 comes from stores, according to figures released this year by the government-backed Waste Resources Action Programme. Of the estimated 15m tonnes of food thrown away in the UK each year, more than half is disposed of in people\u2019s homes. In June, Labour MP Diane Abbott tabled an early-day motion calling on the government to introduce legislation that would ban supermarkets from discarding food that is approaching its best-before date. Instead they would have to make it available to charities. In October, Marks &amp; Spencer launched a scheme to distribute thousands of tonnes of surplus food from its 500 UK stores to local charities, including food banks. Tesco started a similar scheme in June in partnership with the redistribution charity FareShare.",

Mike Coupe, the chief executive, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cFood waste is one of society\u2019s biggest environmental issues at the moment and there is a genuine passion across the UK to tackle it.\u201d</p> <p>The move comes as supermarkets face increasing pressure to tackle food waste. Last week campaigners dumped skips full of waste food outside the headquarters of Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco and delivered a petition signed by more than 190,000 people urging them to reduce waste in their supply chains.</p> <p>The Stop the Rot campaign group wants supermarkets to cut waste at stores and factories by at least 30% by 2025. It is also calling for funds to measure food waste on farms by 2018, so targets can be set for that too.</p> <p>The campaign is backed by celebrity chef <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/hugh-fearnley-whittingstall\">Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall</a> who highlighted supermarket waste in his BBC show <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06nzl5q\">Hugh\u2019s War on Waste</a> last month.</p> <p>Just over 1% of food wasted in the UK \u2013 200,000 tonnes \u2013 comes from stores, according to figures released this year by the government-backed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/waste\">Waste</a> Resources Action Programme. Of the estimated 15m tonnes of food thrown away in the UK each year, more than half is disposed of in people\u2019s homes.</p> <p>In June, Labour MP Diane Abbott tabled an early-day motion calling on the government to introduce legislation that would ban supermarkets from discarding food that is approaching its best-before date.

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen\u2019s emissions scandal has devastated US sales. On Tuesday, the company announced a 25% drop in November compared with last year. The total number of units sold last month was 23,882, down from 31,725 in November 2014. The German carmaker has laid the blame for this drop in sales on the emissions-cheating scandal that broke in September when US researchers found Volkswagen engineers had deliberately gamed software to fool US emissions tests. The company halted sales of the diesel turbocharged direct injection (TDI) models affected after the scandal broke. VW has made much of its \u201cgreener\u201d credentials in the US, and the scandal has tarnished its reputation with US customers. \u201cVolkswagen is working tirelessly on an approved remedy for the affected TDI vehicles. During this time we would like to thank our dealers and customers for their continued patience and loyalty,\u201d said Mark McNabb, chief operating officer of Volkswagen of America. VW also announced on Tuesday that it was recalling 324,000 cars in India to remove devices linked to emissions cheating. This comes a week after VW was ordered by South Korea to recall more than 125,000 diesel vehicles. In October, VW group saw its global sales slip by 3.5%. \u201cThere is caution in buying. The CO2 issue has triggered a greater crisis of confidence [in VW products] than the nitrogen [emissions] issue,\u201d Bernd Osterloh, chief of VW works council, told reporters last week. \u201cEmployment is safe provided we are selling cars. If we sell no cars, it will get relatively difficult.\u201d At a time when VW is struggling to sell cars across the world, carmakers in the US are gearing up for what seems to be a record year for car sales. According to Autodata Corp, the selling rate for 2015, adjusted for seasonal trends, is on track to reach 18.2m vehicles. The last record \u2013 a selling rate of 17.4m cars \u2013 was set 15 years ago in 2000. Many Americans have held off buying a new car during the recessions, leaving large portions of populations with old cars. The US unemployment rate has dropped to 5% and the average gas price, according to American Automobile Association, is set to fall below the $2 per gallon benchmark by Christmas. \u201cIt\u2019s cheap to run \u2019em, it\u2019s cheap to buy \u2019em and there\u2019s more people with jobs, so more people need \u2019em,\u201d Mark Wakefield, managing director and head of the automotive practice for consultant AlixPartners, told Bloomberg. He pointed out that low gas prices have already saved Americans about $98bn. Last month, Fiat Chrysler\u2019s sales reached 175,974 \u2013 a 3% rise. \u201cDespite having two less selling days this November, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US still recorded its best November sales since 2000 and our 68th consecutive month of year-over-year sales increases,\u201d said Reid Bigland, head of US sales for Fiat Chrysler. \u201cThe favorable IOU environment of low interest rates, oil prices, and unemployment, coupled with our strongest product lineup ever, continues to be a significant driver of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles sales.\u201d Hyundai Motor America, which saw a 11.8% rise, said it had its best November ever with 60,000 vehicles sold. Toyota sales were up 3.4%. Nissan North America sales were up 3.8%. Ford sales were up 0.4%. GM sales were up 1.5% in the US. Chevrolet sales were up 4.8%. America Honda Motor sales were down 5.3%, due to a drop in Acura brand sales. \u201cAutomakers are in a very healthy position after the close of Black Friday promotions, with nine of the top 12 manufacturers experiencing notable revenue gains,\u201d said Eric Lyman, vice president of industry insights at TrueCar. \u201cRevenue in December should also be strong as it\u2019s historically a huge month for luxury brands, ranking as the top-selling month for premium vehicles for the past six years.\u201d",

But it has turned its attention to Google as internet searches for Ryanair promote the eDreams website and an eDreams subsidiary, Opodo \u2013 as well as Google\u2019s own flight search adverts \u2013 above Ryanair\u2019s site. Ryanair says it has received thousands of complaints from consumers and accused Google of misleading customers and breaching its own code of conduct. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, said on Tuesday that he forwarded the emails to the inbox of his Google counterpart, Eric Schmidt, and the Irish high court proceedings were an attempt to force action after Ryanair\u2019s complaints were ignored. O\u2019Leary has been incensed that eDreams is advertising lower, non-existent fares, and using a web address whose URL contains the name Ryanair and uses its branding. In a survey conducted on behalf of the airline, 82% of adults believed it was an official Ryanair site. Ryanair says that as well as being subject to additional charges, consumers have experienced problems with their bookings such as contact details being omitted, and checked luggage and additional passengers not being recognised. The airline has been engaged in legal action around Europe against eDreams, a global travel website based in Spain. A recent ruling in Germany has stopped eDreams including the word Ryanair in its German domain name. Ryanair\u2019s chief marketing officer said the airline had no choice but to take legal action against both Google and eDreams. The subdomain, branding and design were \u201ca deliberate attempt to dupe consumers into thinking they are directly booking Ryanair\u2019s low fares\u201d, Kenny Jacobs said. \u201cOur repeated calls for greater Google advert transparency, or for Google to comply with their own code of conduct, have been ignored, and in order to prevent thousands more consumers being misled on the Google search engine, we have commenced these high court proceedings. \u201cWe have no problem with Google charging advertisers on its paid search function, but we expect Google to ensure that this advertising is honest and transparent.\u201d Jacobs admitted the Ryanair of old, before its conversion to improved customer service, may not have taken the high ground over eDreams: \u201cThree years ago we wouldn\u2019t have been sitting here, telling Google to do the right thing ... it\u2019s a bit \u2018poacher turned gamekeeper\u2019.\u201d O\u2019Leary added: \u201cI got a lot of things wrong in the past. But we never engaged in this kind of deception.\u201d He said that while previous Ryanair practices, such as making customers opt out of buying travel insurance and charging for most payment cards, were \u201cegregious errors we made\u201d, consumers had been able to buy their advertised low fares in significant quantities. In contrast, he said: \u201cThese guys advertise fares on Ryanair that simply don\u2019t exist.\u201d The chief executive said there was a \u201cnotional\u201d financial impact on the airline but the legal move was an attempt to stem the complaints and preserve Ryanair\u2019s new, improved reputation. EasyJet has also had long-standing complaints against eDreams, and has warned that passengers who book through third-party websites often do not have their details correctly registered \u2013 an issue the airline believes contributed to difficulties faced by passengers stranded last month in Sharm el-Sheikh who said they were not contacted by the airline. An eDreams spokesperson said: \u201cThe case against Google and eDreams has only just been filed so there is little we can say beyond the fact that we disagree strongly with Ryanair\u2019s position. \u201cThis action is clearly just another attempt from Ryanair to stop online travel agencies from offering consumers the best price and choice when it comes to booking flights.\u201d Google had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "OK, time to wrap up. Britain\u2019s biggest lenders have passed the second major stress tests imposed on the sector since the financial crisis. HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Santander and Nationwide all breezed through - but Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered only got a tick due to action already taken to boost their capital reserves. RBS admitted that it must to more to become a \u2018strong and resilient\u2019 bank. The Bank of England has declared that the \u201cpost-crisis period is over\u201d. It also promised that it is not planning a further wave of capital requirements on the banks. Buy-to-let landlords may be concerned to hear that the BoE is monitoring the sector closely. The central bank is concerned that BTL borrowers could be in the firing line when interest rates rise, or house prices fall. The BoE is also considering imposing a higher counter-cyclical buffer on banks. That would make them hold onto more capital, reining in risky lending and giving them more protection for a downturn. Governor Mark Carney has hinted that this would allow the Bank to leave interest rates at record lows for longer. Bank shares have rallied, as traders showed relief that no-one actually failed the test. And that\u2019s all for today. Cheers. GW Our financial editor Nils Pratley is concerned that the BoE may letting the banks off too easily: In the aftermath of the 2007-09 crisis, regulators seemed determined to set banks\u2019 capital thresholds far higher than is now deemed acceptable. The UK\u2019s Vickers commission and the international Basel committee spoke of core equity ratios of 18%. In the event, the Bank has settled on 11%. Mark Carney, to be fair, gave a full explanation. First, capital is better designed these days \u2013 bondholders in the biggest banks can be forced to take pain in a crisis, for example. Second, \u201cforward-looking\u201d regulators are making better judgments on risks. Third, countercyclical buffers can be flexed up and down as conditions require. The arguments all sound plausible, but 18% to 11% is a mighty leap downwards. Perhaps it was necessary to avoid \u201cthe stability of the graveyard\u201d, meaning banks so over-capitalised that they take too few risks. But perhaps more alarmingly, today\u2019s central bankers just have complete faith in their ability to spot dangers. More here: These two charts explain why the Bank of England is fixing its eye firmly on the buy-to-let market, but isn\u2019t actually trying to puncture the credit market yet: The rallying bank shares mean London\u2019s stock market is beginning December on the front foot. With Barclays jumping 4%, RBS gaining 3% and Lloyds up 2.5%, the wider FTSE 100 has risen by 37 points to 6394. That would be a three week high (if the market closed now). It could be the start of the traditional \u2018Santa rally\u2019, as my colleague Sean Farrell explains: Investors could bag themselves a better Christmas present than socks or an Adele CD by putting money into the stock market at the start of December, if history is a guide. The so-called Santa rally, in which shares do well at the end of the year, is backed up by a surprising amount of evidence but there is less agreement on the cause of the trend. Research by the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown shows that December has been the best month for the stock market in the last 30 years. British shares have risen in December almost nine times in 10 in that time and the average December return was almost three times that for all months of the year... More here. Get your diaries out... the 2016 Budget will take place on Wednesday March 16: Mark Carney\u2019s broad message today is that Britain\u2019s financial sector is finally leaving its \u2018post crisis period\u2019. That\u2019s the long era of reconstruction which began once the dust settled after the failure of Lehman Brothers. It has seen new rules to regulate the City, new bosses at our major banks, and billions of pounds of fines and compensation. The Financial Times has a good take: The Bank of England has declared that the UK\u2019s financial system has moved out of the \u201cpost-crisis period\u201d but was not showing enough signs of overheating to require action to rein in credit. Officials at the Bank clarified that in future they would seek to use regulation to strengthen lenders in good times rather than tame the credit cycle. The BoE\u2019s Financial Policy Committee said on Tuesday it \u201cintends to make active use of the time-varying countercyclical capital buffer\u201d \u2014 the capital banks must build up in good times to ensure they can operate their core banking functions in the event of a shock. But it declined to raise that buffer immediately from 0 per cent and said any increase, expected in March, would not raise overall capital requirements for the UK banking system. \u201cThere is no Basel IV,\u201d said Mark Carney, BoE governor, referring to concerns over a new and tighter round of global banking regulations. \u201cOur objective has never been to raise capital without limit or raise it by stealth.\u201d More here: Bank of England declares end to post-crisis period A quick peek at the commodities market shows why the Bank of England is cautious about the global economy - the iron ore price has hit a record low today: Steven Hall, banking partner at KPMG, has ploughed through today\u2019s stress test results (which are online here) and found a problem. Although the banks had enough decent-quality capital to handle the 2014 test (based on a UK downturn) and also to pass this year\u2019s exam (which included more international risks), they would struggle to pass a combination of both scenarios. And that\u2019s what the 2016 test will do. Hall says: \u201cAnother stress test and another festive celebration as all the banks pass. However the overall severity of the stress impact on CET1 capital levels is higher this year compared with last year. The good news for UK banks is that by combining today\u2019s stress impacts with the additional capital accretion and asset reductions they have completed in 2015 would mean all 7 banks would pass the tougher stress test hurdle that the PRA will apply from next year. We calculate that in aggregate the sector has a buffer of \u00a3115bn of capital as of Q3 2015. The bad news is that if one combined this year\u2019s scenario (trading and conduct related) with last year\u2019s UK domestic property-related shock, we estimate that the aggregate CET1 capital ratio would not meet the proposed 2016\u2019s combined hurdle with an estimated \u00a323 billion shortfall in CET1 capital. Barclays has now climbed to the top of the FTSE 100 leader board, up over 4% today. The City is welcoming today\u2019s stress test results, and Mark Carney\u2019s insistence that regulators won\u2019t impose much tougher capital requirements. Mike Van Dulkan of Accendo Markets says Barclays has done better this year than in the 2014 tests: UK banks shares are in celebratory mood this morning in the wake of the latest round of BoE stress tests. This comes from suggestions that the central bank is set to ease capital pressures on the sector after years of post-crisis reform in contrast to expectations of stiffer hurdles next year. Barclays (BARC), however, is outperforming on account of its bigger exposure to riskier investment banking activities, an area it had been scaling back due to excessive pre-crisis risk-taking that led it into trouble, as well it last year having the lowest levels of capital for this year\u2019s new leverage ratio test. While all passed, peers RBS and Standard Chartered only did so thanks to bolster buffers and ensure targets are hit. Both RBS and Lloyds were close to the mark last year, but Lloyds turnaround efforts have served it while RBS still clearly has much work to do.  It\u2019s good news for new CEO Jes Staley on his first day at Barclays. He had lost 300 grand on shares purchased since his appointment.... A couple of photos from today\u2019s press conference: David Parker, Head of UK &amp; Ireland Banking at Accenture, says the Bank of England is right to be concerned about cybercrime risks (as Jon Cunliffe hinted earlier). Parker says: Interestingly, the Systemic Risk Survey [online here] published today sees a significant increase in those who now believe a cyber-attack poses a risk to the UK financial system. As banks look to offer new services to their customers in an increasingly competitive field, they create the potential for new vulnerabilities in their systems. Financial institutions need to focus on both operational and technical ways to counter this threat. These range from changing the way they think about risk to investing in cutting edge cyber security systems. Every silver lining has a cloud, though: Some unexpected good news from the eurozone just landed. The eurozone unemployment rate has dropped to 10.7%, lower than expected, and the best reading since December 2011: That\u2019s still double the rates in the UK and America, though. Today\u2019s stress test results should give Britain\u2019s banks more confidence to boost their lending. So argues James Belmont, director of risk and compliance at management consultants Baringa Partners: The news that five of the seven banks passed the 2015 stress test, and the remaining two, RBS and StandardChartered, have taken appropriate steps to strengthen their balance sheets and will not be required to raise additional capital, will be given a guarded welcomed across financial markets. It should give banks greater confidence to expand their credit to the real economy, helping fuel job creation and long-term investment. Belmont also reminds us why some banks did worse than others: The extended stress scenario, which included Chinese growth slowing \u201cmaterially\u201d and lower oil prices, had a greater impact on banks with significant retail and corporate presence in Asia and emerging markets, such as HSBC and Standard Chartered, and universal banks with material trade risk exposures to these markets, such as HSBC, Barclays, Standard Chartered and RBS. Back to the stress tests. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic, says the Bank of England seems relatively relaxed about the banking sector. It judged the appropriate Tier 1 equity requirement for the banking system to be 11% of risk-weighted assets, less than the 13% held in aggregate by the major banks in September 2015. And it judged that banks do not need to raise more capital in response to this year\u2019s stress tests, which they all passed by a healthy margin, even though the test\u2019s economic scenario was severe. Breaking away from the Bank of England briefly.... a closely watched survey of British factories has shown that growth slowed last month, but remains fairly solid. The UK manufacturing PMI, which measures activity across the sector, fell to 52.7 in November, down from October\u2019s 16-month high of 55.2. Any reading over 50 indicates that activity and output rose. Markit, which compiled the report, says it shows that manufacturing is less of a drag than during the summer (when it shrank by 0.4%). Markit\u2019s Rob Dobson adds: \u201cWhile the improvement in recent months is a welcome trend, scratching beneath the surface of the manufacturing numbers stills exposes a number of weaknesses. Growth remains heavily focussed on the domestic consumer, while the strong gains at large-scale producers have yet to filter through to SMEs. A broadening of the expansion is necessary if the nascent recovery is to be sustained. Mark Carney ends the press conference by repeating that he\u2019s not planning to slap the sector with tougher capital requirements: That may be a not-too-subtle hint at those bankers who have complained that they might move their headquarters out of Britain to avoid its regulatory regime. Q: Could the Bank include a cyber attack in future stress tests? Deputy governor Jon Cunliffe reminds us that the first stress test (in 2014) focused on the UK economy. Today\u2019s test has an international flavour - modelling an emerging market crash that sends a wave of deflation across the globe. So in the future, the annual stress test won\u2019t change too much - it will model changes in housing, unemployment, some overseas impact. But every other year, the Bank will also launch an \u2018exploratory scenario\u2019, which will allow it to examine a broader range of risks. And a cybercrime attack is \u201ca possibility\u201d, Cunliffe concludes. Any time you increase the capital, there is a flow through to the cost of borrowing, Mark Carney says. Q: What might future stress tests look like? Carney reiterates that the regulators are not planning a new \u2019big wave\u2019 of capital requirements. Instead, they want to strengthen and clean up remaining problems in the system. As Carney puts it: There will be changes that merit the \u2018back page\u2019* of the paper, but not the front page. (* I don\u2019t think he means the sport section!). Reminder: The Bank hasn\u2019t adjusted the counter-cyclical buffer today, but it has signalled that it might do so in March 2016. Q: Would raising the counter-cyclical buffer in March 2016, to force banks to hold more capital, allow the Bank to leave interest rates unchanged for longer? Carney explains that the buffer is a better way of handling risks than raising interest rates (which is a blunter tool). So if you can increase resilience in the system by using this kind of macro-prudential tools, you don\u2019t need to raise interest rates to address financial stability risks. Interest rate rises, when they come, will be limited and gradual, Carney insists (not for the first or last time). So if the Bank\u2019s Financial Stability Committee is vigilant to financial risks, it gives the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee more confidence that it can just use interest rates to handle inflation, not financial stability risks. (I think that\u2019s a \u2018yes\u2019) Q: Why does the Bank of England have a counter-cyclical buffer, and under what conditions might it lower the buffer to encourage risk? This is a complicated issue, Carney says, but worth understanding. The top-line is that there is basically enough capital in the UK banking system to cover future losses. The counter-cyclical buffer is needed because there are deficiencies in how risk is measured globally. (if there weren\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t need the buffer at all). So the buffer goes up when times are good, and down when banks are risk-averse (to encourage lending). Q: Are you under any political pressure to water down your regulatory changes because of complaints from the banks? No, absolutely not, Carney replies. The responsibility for financial stability rests with the Financial Policy Committee, and we will do everything within our power to enforce it and create conditions for balanced, sustained growth. [this relates to the global review of bank\u2019s trading books] And Carney adds that global regulators are absolutely not preparing to force the overall banking sector to hold more capital (although obviously some banks will need to). \u201cI will say it again and I would like you to print it...there is no Basel 4. there is no big wave of capital to come.\u201d (The Basel committee draw up these global rules for banks) Some banks will always need to take actions [to strengthen their capital base], but this is a well-capitalised system, says Mark Carney. Deputy governor Jon Cunliffe also weight in on the buy-to-let market. A survey found that 15% of buy-to-let landlords said they would consider selling if they couldn\u2019t meet their mortgage payments from rental income, he says. And 45% said they would consider selling if house prices fell. And a property downturn can have a serious impact on the banking sector, Cunliffe continues, as commercial real estate is used to secure lending a large percentage of UK borrowing. Carney says there is no question that the Bank has built resilience into the core of the banking system, to protect the UK from global turmoil. Q: How concerned is the Bank of England about the buy-to-let market? Carney says the BoE isn\u2019t taking any action now. He says the new stamp duty levy announced by George Osborne in last week\u2019s autumn statement will affect the market. Deputy governor Andrew Bailey adds that that the Buy-to-Let market isn\u2019t regulated separately. But there is evidence that the sector is more sensitive to interest rate rises than the wider market, so the Prudential Regulatory Authority is watching closely.... Onto questions... Mark Carney says the motivation for raising its counter-cyclical buffer would be to make Britain\u2019s banks safer, not to rein in credit growth. Bank shares have risen at the start of trading in London. Investors are welcoming the stress test results (which mean banks will not be forced to raise more capital). Lloyds, Barclays, RBS and Standard Chartered are all among the top risers on the FTSE 100: Today\u2019s stress test results should reassure the UK public as we head into the Christmas period, Carney concludes. Carney also warns that the global economic climate is challenging, with risks \u2018rotating\u2019 from emerging markets to advance economies and world growth still subdued. Mark Carney confirms that the Bank of England is\u201dactively considering\u201d raising its counter-cyclical buffer. As explained earlier, that would force banks to set aside up to \u00a310bn in extra capital, to protect themselves from a downturn. Mark Carney\u2019s press conference is being streamed live, here. BoE governor Mark Carney is holding a press conference now, to explain today\u2019s stress test results - and the latest Financial Stability Report. Carney says Britain\u2019s banks are significantly stronger than before the financial crisis, which testifies to the value of reforms taken since 2008 to strengthen the banking sector. He adds that global regulators have now agreed capital reserve levels for banks, to ensure they are strong enough to handle their rirks and avoid another severe financial crisis. The Bank of England has also warned that it might take action to cool the buy-to-let markets. Our City editor Jill Treanor explains: The Bank has been warning for many months that it is concerned about the buy-to-let mortgage market. While it did not take immediate action to cool this sector - where lending has risen 10% in the first nine months of the year - it said it was reviewing the lending criteria adopted by firms and stands \u201cready to take action.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson claims that Britain\u2019s banks are \u201cwell placed\u201d for the future, even though RBS and Standard Chartered only passed the tests because they\u2019re already taking remedial action. Here\u2019s HM Treasury\u2019s statement: \u201cToday\u2019s stress test results are testament to the progress that has been made in strengthening Britain\u2019s banks. \u201cThe government\u2019s plan to protect Britain\u2019s economy and extend opportunities for working families requires a resilient banking system capable of weathering future financial storms both at home and abroad. \u201cThat is why we radically reformed the regulatory system putting the Bank of England back at its heart and it is why Britain\u2019s banks are well placed to help secure the economic recovery.\u201d Nationwide is unruffled by the stress test results. It says: The results of the test confirm that under these stress conditions, Nationwide would remain profitable, with minimum stressed ratios for CET1 and leverage of 19.1% and 4.1% respectively, in each case substantially above the regulatory hurdle rates set for this stress test of 4.5% and 3% RBS has also issued a statement to the City, confirming that it passed the test - thanks to recent measures taken to strengthen the bank. RBS\u2019s Tier 1 leverage ratio under the hypothetical adverse scenario was 2.9%. After the impact of management actions, the ratio was 3.0%, which met the 3.0% post-stress minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio threshold set by the BoE. The public has a particular interest in RBS, having rescued the bank from disaster in 2008. Ewen Stevenson, RBS\u2019s chief financial officer, says it is getting stronger: \u201cWe are pleased with the progress we have made relative to the 2014 stress test, but recognise we still have much to do to restore RBS to be a strong and resilient bank for our customers. \u201cDuring 2015 we have continued to strengthen our core capital ratio and improve our leverage position. Following the divestment of Citizens in October 2015, our pro-forma CET1 ratio at 30 September 2015 would have been 16.2% and our leverage ratio 5.6%.\u201d Standard Chartered says it is pleased to have passed the stress test, thanks to the \u201cstrategic management actions\u201d which it is taking this year (including raising $5bn from shareholders). New CEO Bill Winters has told shareholders: \u201cWe are pleased to have met the PRA stress test thresholds through a significant and prolonged stress scenario. The results of the test demonstrate our resilience to a marked slowdown across the key markets in which we operate. The test was conducted on our balance sheet as at the end of 2014. Since then we have made further significant progress in strengthening our capital position. We are operating at capital levels above current minimum regulatory requirements and have a number of additional levers at our disposal to further manage capital.\u2019 This chart shows how the banks capital ratios would fall during the crisis scenarios which the BoE tested: Why such big differences? Because this year\u2019s tests are structured to model a global financial crisis. So Standard Chartered, which is focused on Asia and emerging markets, is particularly hit. The BoE explains: For example, the CET1 ratio of Nationwide, with its focus on UK household lending, is projected to fall to a trough just 0.7 percentage points below its end-2014 starting level. In contrast, with the majority of its exposures in Asia, Standard Chartered\u2019s CET1 ratio is projected to fall by 5.1 percentage points to its low point. These results differ from those of the 2014 stress scenario, which incorporated larger shocks to UK economic activity and house prices. Barclays has issued a statement, confirming it passed the stress tests: It says: Under the BoE\u2019s assessment of the effects of the modelled adverse stress scenario, Barclays\u2019 minimum stressed Common Equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) ratio over the period 2015-19 was 7.3% after the impact of strategic management actions. The minimum stressed CET1 ratio before the impact of strategic management actions of 6.8% exceeded the 4.5% minimum threshold by a significant margin. (CET1 = common tier equity 1, a broad measure of financial strength) My colleague Jill Treanor has been locked in the Bank of England since before 5am, reading the stress tests and the Financial Stability Report. She\u2019s now broken free, and is tweeting the key points: Another important development - the Bank of England has signalled that it will soon want Britain\u2019s banks to hold up to \u00a310bn more capital. It has concluded that the credit cycle has moved to a more \u2018normal phase\u2019, which means it will soon be time to deploy its \u201ccountercyclical capital buffer\u201d. That is the amount of extra capital banks must hold in \u2018the good times\u2019, to cover them for a rainy day. It is currently set at 0% of risk-weighted assets, and the BoE is signalling that it should rise to 1% eventually. It says: \u201cFollowing the global financial crisis, there was a period of heightened risk aversion and retrenchment from risk-taking. The system has now moved out of that period.\u201d The Bank isn\u2019t raising the buffer today -- but it is signalling that this could happen in March 2016. This chart shows how Standard Chartered and RBS were found to have the lowest capital reserves when the stress test scenarios were run: (a smaller number means the bank is more vulnerable) In a nutshell: The Stress Test results are online here. Here\u2019s the official results from the Bank, confirming that five banks passed the tests straight away - while RBS and Standard Chartered had the weakest positions: This stress test did not reveal capital inadequacies for five out of the seven participating banks, based on their balance sheets at end-2014 (Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide Building Society and Santander UK). The Royal Bank of Scotland Group did not meet its individual capital guidance after management actions in this scenario. In light of the steps that The Royal Bank of Scotland Group has already taken to strengthen its capital position, coupled with its plans for future additional Tier 1 (AT1) issuance, the PRA Board did not require The Royal Bank of Scotland Group to submit a revised capital plan. Standard Chartered did not meet its Tier 1 minimum capital requirement of 6% after management actions in this scenario. In light of Standard Chartered\u2019s recent strategy review and the associated steps taken to strengthen its capital position, the PRA Board did not require Standard Chartered to submit a revised capital plan. Here we go! All seven banks have passed the tests. Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC, Nationwide and Santander all cleared them easily. But Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered had a hitch, and had to raise new capital during the process. RBS did not achieve the \u201cindividual capital guidance test\u201d, while Standard Chartered would have failed, if it hadn\u2019t already raised $5.1bn from shareholders in June. The Financial Times also reckons that Britain\u2019s biggest banks will all pass this year\u2019s stress test, but it could be a close-run thing.... The test will model a drop in Chinese economic growth from about 7% to 1.7%, causing property prices to crash in China and Hong Kong. It will also examine the impact of a financial market crisis, including the default of several securities trading counterparties. This year\u2019s test still models tough conditions in the UK economy, which contracts by as much as 2.3%, while residential property prices drop a fifth and there is a prolonged period of deflation and zero interest rates. Last year the Co-operative Bank was the only failure, but it has been excluded this year because it is in the middle of a drastic restructuring. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect any of the firms to fail this year\u2019s test, but the question will be how close do they come to doing so,\u201d said Steven Hall, partner at KPMG. FT: UK banks likely to pass annual BoE stress tests Last year, the Co-operative Bank failed the BoE\u2019s stress tests; it simply didn\u2019t have enough capital to ride out a property downturn. That forced Co-op to start reducing its loan book, meaning it is not taking part this time. This year\u2019s stress tests put more weight on the global economy, which means closer scrutiny of HSBC and Standard Chartered (due to their large international operations) Good morning. We\u2019re about to find out whether Britain\u2019s biggest banks are strong enough to survive another financial crisis. The Bank of England is about to release the results of its annual stress tests, and also give its view on Britain\u2019s financial stability. Barclays, HSBC, Santander UK, Standard Chartered, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Nationwide building society, have all been put through their paces, to find how they would handle a new financial crisis. The scenarios include a \u2018hard landing\u2019 in China, a new eurozone recession, a deep dose of deflation, further cuts in UK interest rates and a UK property crash. The banks will probably all pass. BUT, It\u2019s possible that some may have to cut their payments to shareholders, to ensure they have enough capital to ride out a crisis. The results are released at 7am GMT, followed by a press conference at 8am sharp. As well as the stress tests, the Bank of England is also releasing its latest Financial Stability Report. That will show how concerned the BoE is about the UK economy. It\u2019s possible that the Financial Policy Committee has decided to impose new measures to rein in borrowing, to prevent a credit bubble building up. City editor Jill Treanor explains: Speculation that the Bank could impose more stringent capital rules on banks was sparked by remarks last week by Andy Haldane, the Bank\u2019s chief economist, that consumer credit, and personal loans in particular, had been \u201cpicking up at a rate of knots\u201d. His view that the Bank might want to look \u201cfairly carefully\u201d at this area had led to expectations that the Financial Policy Committee (FPC), set up to look for bubbles in financial markets, might use new powers to demand banks hold more capital against riskier lending operations. I\u2019ll be tracking all the news from the Bank of England through the morning.",

The UK\u2019s Vickers commission and the international Basel committee spoke of core equity ratios of 18%. In the event, the Bank has settled on 11%.</p> <p>Mark Carney, to be fair, gave a full explanation. First, capital is better designed these days \u2013 bondholders in the biggest banks can be forced to take pain in a crisis, for example. Second, \u201cforward-looking\u201d regulators are making better judgments on risks. Third, countercyclical buffers can be flexed up and down as conditions require.</p> <p>The arguments all sound plausible, but 18% to 11% is a mighty leap downwards. Perhaps it was necessary to avoid \u201cthe stability of the graveyard\u201d, meaning banks so over-capitalised that they take too few risks. But perhaps more alarmingly, today\u2019s central bankers just have complete faith in their ability to spot dangers.</p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/dec/01/bank-stress-tests-fail-to-quell-doubts\">Bank stress tests fail to quell doubts</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-565d9ed1e4b0c85a2e20703b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-01T13:34:27.400Z\">1.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>These two charts explain why the Bank of England is fixing its eye firmly on the buy-to-let market, but isn\u2019t actually trying to puncture the credit market yet:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/statuses/671680024362287105\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Buy to let borrowers are more sensitive to interest rate changes <a href=\"https://t.co/IqD9eXxo7g\">pic.twitter.com/IqD9eXxo7g</a></p>&mdash; Duncan Weldon (@DuncanWeldon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/status/671680024362287105\">December 1, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/statuses/671681979901976576\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There&#39;s a time to worry about credit bubbles.

      "bodyText": "Mission accomplished? Assessing the capital health of the UK\u2019s banks is a neverending task, of course, but Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, seems pleased with the current state of affairs. \u201cUK banks are now significantly more resilient than before the global financial crisis,\u201d he declared. Lending to the real economy could continue even if severe stresses materialise. The UK banking system is \u201cwithin sight\u201d of the optimal level of capital.

      "bodyText": "Investors could bag themselves a better Christmas present than socks or an Adele CD by putting money into the stock market at the start of December, if history is a guide. The so-called Santa rally, in which shares do well at the end of the year, is backed up by a surprising amount of evidence, but there is less agreement on the cause of the trend. Research by the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown shows that December has been the best month for the stock market in the past 30 years. British shares have risen in December almost nine times in 10 in and the average return was almost three times that for all months of the year. If someone invested \u00a310,000 in the British stock market 30 years ago and reinvested dividends, the stake would be worth \u00a3152,500 today \u2013 but pulling out each December would have reduced that by almost \u00a380,000, Hargreaves Lansdown found. Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cStock market history suggests Santa really does deliver gifts to investors in December with surprising regularity. Investors should certainly not be investing for just one month, but for those who are currently thinking of investing in the stock market, history indicates they stand a good chance of getting off to a good start.\u201d There are various theories about why share indices tend to rise in December, as they did last year. These include \u201cwindow dressing\u201d by fund managers buying the year\u2019s most successful shares to make their portfolios look good and people investing their Christmas bonuses. Khalaf said window dressing made little sense because clients would ask why the fund manager\u2019s performance did not match the year-end stock picks. The idea that bonuses were invested \u201cprobably credits us with a superhuman level of prudence\u201d, he said. Mike Van Dulken, head of research at the spread betting firm Accendo Markets, said window dressing could take the form of hoarding existing shares that had done well, pushing up prices. Thin trading as the City wound down for Christmas could also exaggerate rises, he said. Santa rallies are starting earlier each year, according to Van Dulken. His firm published a report alerting clients to the trend in early November to make sure they had time to digest the idea. \u201cI believe in the phenomenon. Each year we have published our piece earlier and earlier because it\u2019s becoming a self-fulfilling thing with retail investors buying into the concept,\u201d he said. After a volatile year, the FTSE All-Share index is up more than 4% since mid-November. Van Dulken said gains could have further to go but this December is unusual because the US Federal Reserve was expected to start increasing interest rates after almost seven years close to zero. Markets have tended to react badly to signs that US rates would rise but fears may have been assuaged, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been teed up for it for so long now and people are maybe waiting for it to happen to say: \u2018There are no negative surprises \u2013 let\u2019s carry on\u2019,\u201d he added. The top-performing share in Santa rallies since 2001 was CRH, the building materials company, which had risen in the last two months of the year in all but two years with an average gain of 10.8%, Accendo found. Other strong performers have included Unilever and WPP, though past trends do not indicate future performance. Khalaf argues that the most likely reason for the Santa rally is a general feeling of good cheer as the festive season takes hold. \u201cNo one can really explain this seasonal phenomenon, so don\u2019t be too surprised if it turns out to be one of those years when Santa stays in his grotto,\u201d he said.",

In the ad, which has been viewed on YouTube almost 10m times, a lonely old man comes up with drastic measures to bring his family together: he fakes his own death. It starts with the man, played by British actor Arthur Nightingale, receiving a voicemail from his daughter telling him that, once again, the family won\u2019t make it home for Christmas. He sits alone at the dinner table, enduring yet another lonely Christmas. In the next scene, his children, all busy in daily life, get the news that their father has died. One of the sons, on a business trip to China, starts crying and another fights to hold back tears in his job at hospital. They all meet at their father\u2019s house, grieving and dressed in black, but to their astonishment find the table set for dinner and their father, obviously alive, emerging from the kitchen. \u201cHow else could I have brought you all together?\u201d he asks. The loneliness of the elderly at Christmas was raised by John Lewis in its Man on the Moon ad, which has been viewed almost 20m times. Sainsbury\u2019s also went for the sentimental approach by resurrecting Mog the Cat for its Christmas ad, which has had more than 18m views on Youtube. The Edeka ad, which was created by German advertising agency Jung von Matt, has received a mixed response in social media, with some finding it too dark while others have welcomed the spotlight on loneliness.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Growth in Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector has weakened and costs are falling sharply, suggesting inflationary pressure remains subdued, and Bank of England policymakers are unlikely to be in a rush to raise interest rates. The purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for manufacturing, based on a survey of the sector, declined to 52.7 in November, from a revised 55.2 in October. That remained above the 50-level that signals expansion; but suggested momentum in the sector is weakening. Analysts at data provider Markit, which carries out the survey, also pointed out that prices are falling at one of the fastest rates in the survey\u2019s 24-year history, as declining global commodity costs feed through the supply chain. Rob Dobson, of Markit, said: \u201cIf this mix of subdued growth and weak price pressures is reflected in other sections of the economy, the Bank of England will have further cause to push any potential rate increase into the spring of 2016.\u201d Bank of England governor Mark Carney has suggested that the decision about rate rises is likely to \u201ccome into sharper relief around the turn of this year;\u201d but continued deflation across industry is likely to undermine the arguments for an increase in borrowing costs at next week\u2019s monetary policy committee meeting, the last of 2015. Dobson added that growth among manufacturers remains focused on consumer sectors, rather than the exports the government is keen to promote; and is concentrated in larger firms. \u201cWhile the improvement in recent months is a welcome trend, scratching beneath the surface of the manufacturing numbers stills exposes a number of weaknesses,\u201d he said. Samuel Tombs, of consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the survey underlined the fact that while the chancellor may want to rebalance the economy towards manufacturing, creating a \u201cmarch of the makers\u201d, growth is likely to continue to be reliant on the key services sector. \u201cWith the strong pound making exports uncompetitive and domestic consumer demand likely to grow less robustly next year as real income growth slows, the manufacturing sector is unlikely to see sustained growth in the near-term.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A stoush between the manufacturer of Tim Tams and a major retailer has been resolved, ending any fears of a potential shortage of Australia\u2019s favourite chocolate biscuit. But reports of a \u201cTim Tam war\u201d between Arnott\u2019s and Coles appear to have been overstated. The Australian reported on Tuesday that Arnott\u2019s told Coles in early October it was planning to raise wholesale prices of some lines, including Tim Tams. Coles refused to pay the higher prices, and two weeks later Arnott\u2019s stopped supplying the items. Coles held out for 10 days, but then agreed to pay the higher price for 44 of the 54 biscuit lines and seven of the 11 stock products. The others are no longer stocked by the supermarket. The affected varieties of Tim Tam are Royal Dark; the Adriano Zumbo range in Coconut Cream, Choc Raspberry and Salted Caramel; and the Chocolicious multipacks in Dark, Caramel and Original. Arnott\u2019s Twisted Faves in Salted Caramel and Strawberry Cream and the Arnott\u2019s Cheeseboard were also culled from Coles\u2019s range in the stoush, as were Campbell\u2019s stock in beef, chicken, vegetable and salt-reduced 500ml varieties. The loss of the less popular Tim Tam lines (and stock varieties) gives consumers a choice between shopping at another retailer or switching allegiance to the Double Coat variety, still reportedly in plentiful stock. A spokesman said the supermarket chain had a commitment to bring down the cost of shopping for its customers. \u201cSo when a major international manufacturer decides they will unilaterally force through a price hike without justification, we will resist that. \u201cOur average family shopper spends around $150 per week on food and groceries, and they don\u2019t have the spare cash laying around to give to Campbell\u2019s-Arnotts every time they decide to put their prices up.\u201d Arnott\u2019s said that as a matter of policy it did not discuss its customers or its business, and would not be providing further comment. But it did issue a statement, reassuring \u201cconcerned Aussies that there is no shortage of supply of our famous biscuits, including Tim Tam\u201d. It confirmed that the standard wholesale price had been increased in October. Arnott\u2019s said that its customers \u2013 the retailers \u2013 set the price at which biscuits are resold to consumers, and reminded concerned readers that they could \u201ccurrently find great Tim Tam promotions across different national retailer this week\u201d, though it did not give specifics.",

The American banker, who spent much of his career at JP Morgan, paid 233p for each of the 2.8m shares he bought on 4 November and is now facing a 10p loss on each share as they closed on Monday at 223p. He spent \u00a36.4m buying the shares. He formally becomes chief executive on Tuesday, the same day that Barclays receives the results of stress tests imposed on the UK\u2019s major lenders to test their resilience to a shock in the global markets and prolonged deflation. Staley, who stands to receive \u00a310m in his first year, replaces Antony Jenkins, who was ousted in July to put a new emphasis on growth at the bank which has been scrambling to repair its reputation in the wake of the 2012 Libor rigging scandal. Once the outcome of the stress test is known, Staley will have the task of setting a strategy for the bank that bolsters returns to shareholders but also satisfies regulators\u2019 requirement for it to ringfence its high street business from its riskier investment banking operations. Ian Gordon, a banks analyst at Investec, said the key to improving returns was focusing on cutting costs rather than aiming for dramatic increases in revenue. \u201cRevenues fell 5% in 2013, 8% in 2014 and we forecast a 3% decline in 2015,\u201d said Gordon. His forecasts for revenue growth in 2016 and 2017 respectively are 2% and 3%. Staley has already told staff that he wants to turn Barclays into a bank that is \u201csuccessful, admired and well regarded by all\u201d. Last week, Jenkins predicted that the banking industry could see a 50% cut in jobs over the next 10 years as a result of technological advances.",
