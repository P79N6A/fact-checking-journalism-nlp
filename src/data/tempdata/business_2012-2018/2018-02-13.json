These two facts are connected: the reason young people have become renters rather than owner-occupiers is that property became expensive. Property has become so dear that the average first-time buyer is now 30 years old and has a salary of \u00a341,000 a year. Owner-occupation rates have fallen from 70% to 63% over the past decade and it is not difficult to see why. Ultra-low interest rates mean that it has never been cheaper to service a mortgage, but that doesn\u2019t matter all that much when the price of a home relative to incomes is so high. For those who want to buy their own home, the good news is that house-price inflation will be modest in 2018. Earnings growth is still around 2.5%; the Bank of England is warning that interest rates are likely to go up faster and by more than previously expected; and tax changes that have helped cause a 17% annual drop in buy-to-let purchases in the year to December are going to become more stringent in April. House prices would already be falling were it not for the fact that interest rates and unemployment are low. It was the combination of 15% interest rates and a doubling of the jobless total that caused the property-price collapse of the early 1990s, and a repeat of that looks highly improbable because of a (welcome) lack of distressed sellers. The air has gradually been seeping out of the housing-market bubble for the past 18 months, and that process will continue until the house price-to-earnings ratio falls to more sustainable levels, making property affordable to more first-time buyers. House prices are going to tread water and despite what estate agents might say, this is no bad thing. On the contrary, it is an entirely healthy development. Nicky Morgan gets tough over RBS. About time too In a week\u2019s time, the damning report spelling out how just how badly the Royal Bank of Scotland treated its small business customers will be fully in the public domain. That\u2019s the clear message from Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury select committee. Morgan is taking a no-nonsense approach to her dealings with the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, which commissioned the report into RBS\u2019s Global Restructuring Group but has so far only released edited highlights from it. The FCA has said it will be breaking the law if it publishes the full report without the consent of the RBS executives named or implicated in the findings, but late last week was ordered by Morgan either to do so or to hand over a copy to her committee. Andrew Bailey, the FCA\u2019s chairman, said he would hand over the report by this Friday if \u2013 as was almost certain \u2013 he had failed to get permission from the RBS executives by then. But a copy of the report has now found its way online and Morgan has had enough. \u201cA version of the report is now in the public domain. The FCA has completely lost control of the publication process,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the FCA doesn\u2019t publish or provide the report by Friday, it will have breached an order of the House of Commons and may be found in contempt of parliament.\u201d Ouch. Morgan will use parliamentary privilege to ensure that the report can be published in full without legal challenge from RBS executives \u2013 and a good thing too. The way in which the bank treated its small business customers was scandalous. That it was more than 80% owned by the government at the time adds insult to injury. What is the statistics office trying to say about MPs? The Office for National Statistics has announced that from April it will be publishing its report on the state of the UK labour market on a Tuesday rather than a Wednesday. The reason, according to the ONS, is that the release \u2013 which includes data for employment, unemployment, job vacancies and earnings \u2013 currently comes out two and a half hours before Theresa May stands up for prime minister\u2019s questions. To be sure, the labour market statistics run to many pages and \u2013 as the ONS notes \u2013 are complicated and multi-faceted.

      "bodyText": "Despite an opening fall on Wall Street after two trading days of recovery, markets in Europe had a fairly calm session. With the euro gaining some ground against a weaker dollar, they ended slightly down on the day but there was by no means any sustained burst of selling. Italy was among the worst performers, as investors started to fret about the country\u2019s forthcoming election. In the UK investors shrugged off the higher than expected inflation figures, which gave some credence of the Bank of England\u2019s hints of rising interest rates. In the US, investors decided to take some profits ahead of the key inflation figures due on Wednesday. The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 9.05 points or 0.13% lower at 7168.01 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.7% to 12,196.50 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.6% at 5109.24 italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.35% to 22,034.42 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.23% lower at 9650.7 In Greece, the Athens market edged down 0.2% to 821.85 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 111 points or 0.45%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. As US interest rates do go up, it will put more pressure on households who have borrowed heavily. And the latest figures show an increase in debt, up $193bill to $13.15tn in the three months to December compared to the previous quarter. The figure was $402bn higher than the same time in 2016. The increase was driven by a rise in mortgage loans. The markets have dealt fairly well with the stronger than expected UK inflation figures, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: Though the global indices are broadly negative, the markets haven\u2019t coped too badly with a pretty damn hawkish UK CPI reading. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if investors have the same kind of reaction to tomorrow\u2019s US figures \u2013 after all, it was fears that the country\u2019s inflation would continue to creep higher that helped spark the recent market bloodbath. Meanwhile in Cyprus it has been announced that finance minister Harris Georgiades, much plaudited for masterminding the island\u2019s economic recovery, will retain his position in a new government unveiled today. Helena Smith reports: The news will go down well in Brussels. Georgiades is feted for almost single handedly overseeing Cyprus\u2019 extraordinary return to growth after it was bailed out to the tune of \u20ac10bn during its banking crisis five years ago. The island, which exited its bailout programme ahead of schedule in March 2016 following stringent implementation of reforms, was one of the fastest growing economies in the euro area with a growth rate of 3.8 % in 2017. At 7.4 % it also registered the biggest year-on-year drop in government debt. But challenges still lie ahead: the island has one of the highest bank stocks of non-performing loans which, increasingly, has been cause for alarm in Brussels. President Nicos Anastasiades, re-elected to a second five year term in office ten days ago, may well have held onto him in the knowledge that the 45-year-old economist will rise to the challenge of restructuring the bad debt. New Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said the global economy has recovered strongly since the financial crisis, but the bank remained alert to any risks to stability. In opening remarks at his swearing in ceremony, he said: We are in the process of gradually normalizing both interest rate policy and our balance sheet with a view to extending the recovery and sustaining the pursuit of our objectives. We will also preserve the essential gains in financial regulation while seeking to ensure that our policies are as efficient as possible. We will remain alert to any developing risks to financial stability. European markets appear relatively untroubled by the falls in the US, which seem fairly contained so far. The FTSE 100 is off its best levels and is virtually flat on the day, but Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac have recovered from the worst of their earlier losses and around both down around 0.3%. After two days of recovery, US markets are falling back again at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 95 points or 0.4% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both opened around 0.5% lower. The dips come ahead of consumer price data due on Wednesday, which will reinforce talk of interest rate rises if the figures come in stronger than expected. David Morrison, senior market strategist at GKFX, said: Headline CPI (including food and energy) came in at +2.2% in November but slipped back to 2.1% in December. Investors are hoping for further evidence that inflation has topped out for now. If so, and we see another modest reduction to 2.0% then this should be enough to push bond yields down and equities up. But in the current environment we can expect US Treasury yields to soar if January\u2019s number were to come in at 2.1% or higher. This would be a problem as the key 10-year Treasury note yield is dangerously close to testing 3.0% - a four-year high, increasing fears that the 35-year bond bull market is finally over. This would signal higher borrowing costs to come which would not be good for global equities. Earlier Cleveland Federal Reserve president Loretta Mester said the recent stock market sell-off would not damage the economy\u2019s strong prospects. She added that inflation was expected to rise towards the Fed\u2019s 2% target over time, but not so fast the Fed needed to increase rates more quickly. The pound has come off its best levels against the dollar. After hitting a high of $1.3923 following the stronger than expected inflation figures, it has now drifted back to $1.3874, a 0.3% gain on the day. Despite the unchanged inflation figure of 3% - rather than the expected dip - an imminent UK interest rate rise is not necessarily a done deal, says Forex.com market analyst Fawad Razaqzada: The pound staged a small rally after this morning\u2019s publication of the latest UK inflation figures, before giving back a sizeable chunk of its gains against the dollar. It actually turned negative against the euro and yen, though it was holding its own better against commodity currencies...Overall inflation rose more than expected, and the pound\u2019s initial response was a swift rally. However sterling came off its best levels around midday as traders who bought the news, took profit. It is worth noting that the Bank of England will probably not be surprised by the outcome of today\u2019s inflation figures after it predicted that CPI will remain elevated and that it intends to combat this by raising interest rates earlier and faster than previously expected. But is the BoE correct in its projections? Can they be trusted? While inflation could easily rise further, one has to consider the alternative scenario too. After all, the impact of sterling\u2019s post declines has fallen away. What\u2019s more, crude oil prices have been falling of late, with both Brent and WTI recently turning negative on the year. If oil prices fall further then this may be reflected in lower fuel and energy prices, and hopefully lower inflation. Given the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the BoE would favour not having to hike rates if inflation were to fall back. So, an imminent rate hike is not a done deal by any means. Still, the BoE has definitely dropped its dovish bias and the next change in interest rates will most likely be a raise than a cut. So, there is a possibility we may see the pound drift higher in the coming months. If sterling were to shine, its best bet would be against a non-US dollar currency, as the greenback has been on a good run of form against most currencies of late. One of the concerns driving the recent turmoil in the markets was a rise in inflation and the subsequent belief that central banks might start raising interests rates more quickly than expected. But Capital Economics believes that inflation may not rise very far. Chief global economist Andrew Kenningham said: For a start, underlying inflation has remained low and stable recently. Core inflation in the OECD was 1.9% in December. Moreover, it has been between 1.5% and 2.0% for the past six years, and 1.1% and 2.5% since 2003. The stability of underlying inflation for most of this century suggests that only a huge economic shock, or major structural change, would dislodge it far from the typical 2% target. Of course, the average inflation rate can mask big variations between countries. But even in economies which are closest to full employment, inflation has remained low. In Japan, where the unemployment rate is at its lowest level since 1993, inflation excluding fresh food and energy is only 0.3%. And in Germany, the unemployment rate is at its lowest since 1980 but core inflation is just 1.5%. Second, wage inflation is not rising very rapidly. We do expect average earnings growth in the US to trend up this year but the jump to 2.9% y/y in January, which triggered the market sell-off, was exacerbated by temporary weather patterns and may be reversed. Fears that trade union demands will push Germany\u2019s inflation rate up sharply look misplaced. (See our European Economic Update, \u201cGerman pay demands won\u2019t see inflation surge\u201d, 30th January.) And elsewhere in the euro-zone, wage pressures are much weaker. Third, inflation expectations remain low. For the euro-zone and the US, measures of expected inflation between five and ten years in the future derived from financial markets are still below their post-crisis average. And while the University of Michigan measure of household inflation expectations in the US edged up to 2.5% in January, this is still below its average level since the financial crisis. Finally, the inflationary impact of higher oil prices is likely to fade in the coming months. Indeed, if we are right in expecting Brent crude prices to decline, energy price inflation will turn negative next year. He concludes: The big picture is that global inflation is edging up, not taking off. The upshot is that while interest rates are likely to rise gradually over the next year or two, there is no need to panic. We expect government bond yields to rise, but remain very low by historical standards, with ten-year US Treasury yields, for example, unlikely to get much higher than 3% by the end of this year. If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s inflation figures: Britain\u2019s stock market is holding onto its earlier gains, and so is the pound. The FTSE 100 is currently up 20 points, or 0.3%, on top of Monday\u2019s 1.2% jump. That\u2019s despite the pound gaining half a cent against the US dollar following the inflation figures (a strong sterling is usually bad for shares). Mining companies are leading the rally, as the weaker US dollar pushes up commodity prices, along with holiday companies after today\u2019s decent results from TUI. This follows a strong day on Wall Street yesterday, and gains across most of Asia earlier on Tuesday. However, European stocks are being dragged down by the strengthening euro (the dollar is getting a kicking generally today). The US stock market opens in just over an hour, and is expected to dip.... In other news (which I missed earlier), UK house prices are rising faster than wages or the headline inflation rate. Average house prices in the UK rose by 5.2% in the year to December 2017, up from 5.0% in November 2017. That\u2019s twice as fast as earnings, underlining how hard it is to get onto the property ladder (even though price rises have slowed). London was the slowest part of the housing market, with prices only rising by 2.5% over the last year. However, that still leaves the average house in the capital at \u00a3484,000 - more than double the UK average of \u00a3227,000. Paul Mumford, fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management, is hopeful that inflation might fall this month: He explains: January\u2019s figures exclude the full effect of the recent market shake out, a subsequent decline in oil prices and weaker sterling against the dollar. It could easily be that inflation drops back in February, something that would take the pressure off of rates. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at thinktank NIESR, predicts that UK interest rates will rise in May (probably from 0.5% to 0.75%).....and keep rising over the next couple of years: Kara says: UK January CPI inflation was unchanged at 3.0%. Inflation has likely peaked and is set to return to the target rate of 2.0% over the next eight quarters. Our forecast assumes a rate increase by the MPC in May and every 6 months after that until it reaches 2%.\u201d In historical terms, that would be a relatively low cost of borrowing (UK interest rates averaged 5% before the financial crisis). But it could still put some families in a very tough spot - especially as wages are being eroded by inflation Jane Tully, director of external affairs at the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, is worried, saying: Inflation remains high at three percent with wages not keeping pace, and for the thousands of people we hear from each week at National Debtline, meeting day-to-day costs, such as energy, water and council tax continues to be a challenge. \u201cRecent research shows that as many as half of all low income households are already struggling. We are concerned that the slightest change in circumstances, such as a further interest rate rise, could push many of these households into further difficulty. At 3%, the UK\u2019s consumer prices index is close to the six-year high of 3.1% struck in November. And inflation is becoming an increasingly home-grown problem, rather than simply being driven by higher import costs. Stephen Clarke, Senior Economic Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, explains: \u201cContrary to expectations, inflation held steady on last month, meaning households will have to wait until later in 2018 for expected falls to materialise. \u201cBut the drivers of inflation are changing. While the price of oil is something to watch in future as it pushes up input prices for UK manufacturers, the effect of the post-Brexit pound devaluation is waning slightly with items that are less import-intensive driving the recent rise ininflation. Prices of recreational and cultural goods, such as trips to the cinema, rose at their fastest rate for 8 years. \u201cWhile Brexit continues to dominate the headlines, looking forward we need to be paying more attention to domestic cost pressures.\u201d Here\u2019s a handy breakdown of the factors pushing inflation up: [Eagle-eyed readers will note that Resolution are using \u2018CPIH\u2019, a measure of inflation which includes owner occupiers\u2019 housing costs. It stuck at 2.7% in January] Bad news for UK households: economists expect UK inflation to only fall slowly during 2018. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, fears that the real wage squeeze will continue for most of this year: \u201cInflation remained stuck at 3% in January, still well above earnings growth. \u201cWe do expect inflation to fall back gradually over the course of the year, but this will be a slow process given that global commodity prices have generally been on an upward trend in recent months. The squeeze on real earnings may therefore persist until late in 2018, which will continue to dampen consumer spending growth this year.\u201d Inflation has been running ahead of wages since the start of 2017, as this chart shows: If wages do start rising, the Bank of England will face more pressure to raise interest rates. That would be a blow to indebted families who are already struggling to handle their debts. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: Economists have been expecting inflation to gradually fall back to the 2% target over the coming year or so, starting today with a drop to 2.9%. But in fact the rate remained at 3.0%, with price rises driven by clothing, footwear and recreational goods/services. Inflation\u2019s now been above target for 12 straight months. This adds further weight to the case for higher interest rates sooner rather than later. Indeed Bank of England policymakers said last week they\u2019ll try and bring inflation back to target more quickly than previously expected, which means rates could rise faster and further than anticipated. The news that recreational costs (such as zoo and parks) prevented inflation falling last month has caused a bit of a stir in the City. James Smith of ING bank predicts that this trend won\u2019t last: Core inflation rose more than expected to 2.7%, as recreation prices fell considerably less rapidly than would be seasonally expected at the start of the year. Some of this is reportedly down to entrance fees at zoos and gardens, but given that much of the recreation category (things like computers and TVs) is fairly sterling-sensitive, we wouldn\u2019t expect this resilience to last. That\u2019s because the sharp fall in the pound after the Brexit vote has now more-or-less fed through to consumer prices and the rate of pass-through is starting to ease. The recent sterling strength will only accelerate this process. Encouragingly for consumers, the prices charged by UK factories rose at a slower rate in January. The annual producer price inflation rate dipped to 4.7%, down from 5.4% in December. That suggests that the impact of the pound\u2019s Brexit-vote slump may be fading. The ONS says: \u201cFactory goods price inflation continued to slow, with food prices falling in January. The growth in the cost of raw materials also slowed, with the prices of some imported materials falling.\u201d With inflation stuck at 3%, British workers are still suffering a cost of living squeeze. Average wages only rose by 2.4% per year in the three months to November (the most recent figures), or by 2.5% if you include bonuses. So in practice, wages are shrinking by around 0.5% to 0.6%. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says the government needs to act - by raising wages for the lowest paid, and pumping more money into infrastructure projects. She warns: \u201cInflation is still outpacing wages and working people\u2019s living standards are falling fast. The government can\u2019t keep on standing by and doing nothing. A plan to boost wages is urgently needed. \u201cPublic sector workers must get a proper pay rise. The minimum wage must go up to \u00a310 as quickly as possible. And the Chancellor must boost infrastructure spending in his spring statement \u2013 this would help counter the loss of confidence in the economy caused by Brexit uncertainty.\u201d The Treasury, though, tweets that it\u2019s doing its bit... The Bank of England is charged with keeping Britain\u2019s inflation rate close to 2%, so today\u2019s data show it has a lot more work to do. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says: \u201cThere is no breathing space for Mark Carney and the Bank of England who continue to battle with high inflation, though at least that figure has steadied and not risen further. \u201cDespite many expecting the figure to drop, inflation remains at 3%, sitting way above the Bank\u2019s 2% target, though policy makers will at least be pleased to see producer prices fall back. So could the Bank raise interest rates soon, as it hinted last week? Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, says a May interest rate hike is certainly possible - although he thinks Carney and co will hold off.... Today\u2019s number will keep the May Bank of England meeting \u2018in play\u2019 for an interest rate hike. We think that this is still too early for a hike as caveats on Brexit and the sustainability of growth remain but as we heard last Thursday, the sticky inflation picture is putting gradual but sooner increases in the base rate into more people\u2019s central scenarios of what happens in the UK in 2018.\u201d The pound has jumped on the back of the news that Britain\u2019s inflation rate was higher than expected last month. Sterling gained half a cent to $1.39, as traders calculated that it makes an early interest rate rise more likely. UK food prices fell between December and January (which makes sense, as people tighten their belts after the Christmas festivities). The ONS says: This effect came from prices for a wide range of types of food and drink, with the largest contribution coming from a fall in meat prices. However, prices are still higher than a year ago, as these charts show: The Office for National Statistics says that petrol prices had a downward impact on inflation....but recreational activities kept the cost of living up. It says: The largest downward contribution to change in the rate came from prices for motor fuels, which rose by less than they did a year ago. The main upward effect came from prices for a range of recreational and cultural goods and services, in particular, admissions to attractions such as zoos and gardens, for which prices fell by less than they did a year ago. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s inflation rate remained at 3% in January. That\u2019s higher than the 2.9% that the City had expected, and means the cost of living squeeze continues. More to follow... The MSCI world stock market index has recovered a small slice of last week\u2019s slump: That\u2019s thanks to last night\u2019s rally on Wall Street, followed by the gains in most of Asia today. The US dollar has weakened after the US government outlined its 2019 budget last night - showing whopping deficits in the years ahead. Under Donald Trump\u2019s new $4.4 trillion budget plan, the US federal deficit would hit around $1 trillion next year - even though he\u2019s also aiming to cut welfare spending. And looking further ahead, there\u2019s no expectation of a balanced budget in the next decade, due to Trump tax cuts and his plans to to hike military spending. This splurge of borrowing - if approved by Congress - would push America\u2019s national debt to fresh record highs. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take: President Donald Trump\u2019s budget for the upcoming fiscal year calls for steep cuts to America\u2019s social safety net and mounting spending on the military. That combination in the $4.4 trn budget plan submitted Monday to Congress steps far back from Trump\u2019s promises last year to balance the federal budget. If enacted, his plan would establish annual $1 trillion-plus deficits, a major reversal for Republicans who objected to increased spending during the Obama administration. Trump\u2019s budget revives his calls for big cuts to domestic programs that benefit the poor and middle class, such as food stamps, housing subsidies and student loans. Retirement benefits would remain mostly untouched, as Trump has pledged, though Medicare providers would absorb about $500bn in cuts a nearly 6 percent reduction. Asian stock markets have closed with gains across the board...apart from Japan, where the stronger yen pulled the Nikkei down. European stock markets are being held back today by the weakness of the US dollar. The euro has gained 0.3% against the US dollar to $1.232, which (as in Japan) has a negative impact on shares. So while London\u2019s market is slightly higher, the main European indices are dipping a little. Investec economist Victoria Clarke predicts that Britain\u2019s inflation rate held steady at 3% las month - dashing hopes of a fall to 2.9% She writes: We expect CPI inflation to trend lower over the year ahead, although it may be a slow creep. Indeed, we are pencilling in a steady 3.0% in January. Clarke reckons that air fares fell less in January than a year ago; meaning they applied \u201csome upward pressure\u201d to the 12-month inflation rate. But food and fuel may have risen slower, she adds: We expect this to be more than offset by drags from elsewhere in the wider transport category, given that the rise in petrol prices looks set to be notably less than in January 2017. Another negative influence is the food price category. Britain\u2019s stock market is gaining a little ground in early trading. FTSE 100 has risen by 17 points at the open, sending the blue-chip index up 0.22% to 7191. Holiday group TUI is the biggest riser, up 2.5%, after reporting an 8% rise in turnover in the last quarter and a smaller net loss. TUI says sales of summer holidays for 2018 has \u201cstarted well\u201d. Demand remains strong for the Western Mediterranean and Caribbean (despite hurricane disruption and reflecting demand from North America) and continues to improve for Turkey and North Africa. Japan\u2019s stock market isn\u2019t coming to the party, though. The Nikkei fell 0.7% today to 21,244.68. The selloff came as the yen hit a five-month high against the US dollar, which hurts Japanese exporters. China\u2019s stock market helped led the recovery in Asia today, with South Korea and Hong Kong close behind. The benchmark Chinese index, the CSI 300, has gained almost 1.2% in late trading. South Korea\u2019s Kospi 200 is up 0.9%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng has gained 1.3%. while Australia is up a more modest 0.6%. But this doesn\u2019t mean the recent phase of volatility is over, as Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities explains: What we\u2019re seeing right now is a continuation from Friday\u2019s bullish session that allowed the global stock markets to breathe a bit easier and with bond yields retreating slightly from their recent highs equity traders are looking for bargains. Nevertheless, it is still too early to suggest that the correction that we\u2019ve witnessed since the beginning of the month is over. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After last week\u2019s turmoil, a degree of calm has returned to the financial world. Most Asian stock markets are rallying today, after a strong performance on Wall Street last night which saw the Dow jumping 410 points. With fears of a crash fading, investors can indulge in one of their favourite pastimes - trying to bag a bargain. As Jim Fong, portfolio manager at Oceanwide Asset Management Ltd, puts it: (via Marketwatch) \u201cIt\u2019s a golden opportunity to accumulate some good, quality stocks. European markets are expected to open calmly; a change for traders who have watched the major indices swing violently in recent days. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains: Overnight the Dow had its best session in two years jumping over 400 points. It\u2019s fair to say that whilst volatility has eased up from the 1000 plus swings last week, these are still much more volatile sessions than what we are used to. The impressive rally on Wall Street spilled across into Asian markets, which posted healthy gains across the session. Unsurprisingly European bourses look set to follow suit and push on higher at the open. Here\u2019s the opening calls for Europe\u2019s major stock markets: UK FTSE to open 7 points higher at 7184 German DAX to open 26 points higher at 12,308 French CAC to open 12 points higher at 5152 But the mood in the City could change when the latest UK inflation figures are released this morning. The Consumer Prices Index is expected to fall to 2.9% in January, down from December\u2019s 3%. But, given the strength of the oil price, some City economists doubt whether inflation has started falling yet. Royal Bank of Canada say: With the oil price having risen significantly in recent months it now looks more likely that CPI inflation will be relatively slow to fall in 2018 even though the impact of previous exchange rate depreciation starts to fade. A high inflation reading puts more pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates soon - as it threatened last week.

Despite the unchanged inflation figure of 3% - rather than the expected dip - an imminent UK interest rate rise is not necessarily a done deal, says Forex.com market analyst Fawad Razaqzada:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound staged a small rally after this morning\u2019s publication of the latest UK inflation figures, before giving back a sizeable chunk of its gains against the dollar. It actually turned negative against the euro and yen, though it was holding its own better against commodity currencies...Overall inflation rose more than expected, and the pound\u2019s initial response was a swift rally. However sterling came off its best levels around midday as traders who bought the news, took profit.</p> <p>It is worth noting that the Bank of England will probably not be surprised by the outcome of today\u2019s inflation figures after it predicted that CPI will remain elevated and that it intends to combat this by raising interest rates earlier and faster than previously expected. But is the BoE correct in its projections? Can they be trusted?</p> <p>While inflation could easily rise further, one has to consider the alternative scenario too. After all, the impact of sterling\u2019s post declines has fallen away. What\u2019s more, crude oil prices have been falling of late, with both Brent and WTI recently turning negative on the year. If oil prices fall further then this may be reflected in lower fuel and energy prices, and hopefully lower inflation. Given the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the BoE would favour not having to hike rates if inflation were to fall back. So, an imminent rate hike is not a done deal by any means. </p> <p>Still, the BoE has definitely dropped its dovish bias and the next change in interest rates will most likely be a raise than a cut. So, there is a possibility we may see the pound drift higher in the coming months. If sterling were to shine, its best bet would be against a non-US dollar currency, as the greenback has been on a good run of form against most currencies of late.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a82ec52e4b03213d18fb408\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-13T13:51:08.217Z\">1.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the concerns driving the recent turmoil in the markets was a rise in inflation and the subsequent belief that central banks might start raising interests rates more quickly than expected.</p> <p>But Capital Economics believes that inflation may not rise very far. Chief global economist Andrew Kenningham said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For a start, underlying inflation has remained low and stable recently. Core inflation in the OECD was 1.9% in December. Moreover, it has been between 1.5% and 2.0% for the past six years, and 1.1% and 2.5% since 2003. The stability of underlying inflation for most of this century suggests that only a huge economic shock, or major structural change, would dislodge it far from the typical 2% target.</p> <p>Of course, the average inflation rate can mask big variations between countries. But even in economies which are closest to full employment, inflation has remained low. In Japan, where the unemployment rate is at its lowest level since 1993, inflation excluding fresh food and energy is only 0.3%. And in Germany, the unemployment rate is at its lowest since 1980 but core inflation is just 1.5%. </p> <p>Second, wage inflation is not rising very rapidly. We do expect average earnings growth in the US to trend up this year but the jump to 2.9% y/y in January, which triggered the market sell-off, was exacerbated by temporary weather patterns and may be reversed. Fears that trade union demands will push Germany\u2019s inflation rate up sharply look misplaced. (See our European Economic Update, \u201cGerman pay demands won\u2019t see inflation surge\u201d, 30th January.) And elsewhere in the euro-zone, wage pressures are much weaker. </p> <p>Third, inflation expectations remain low. For the euro-zone and the US, measures of expected inflation between five and ten years in the future derived from financial markets are still below their post-crisis average. And while the University of Michigan measure of household inflation expectations in the US edged up to 2.5% in January, this is still below its average level since the financial crisis. </p> <p>Finally, the inflationary impact of higher oil prices is likely to fade in the coming months. Indeed, if we are right in expecting Brent crude prices to decline, energy price inflation will turn negative next year.</p> </blockquote> <p>He concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The big picture is that global inflation is edging up, not taking off. The upshot is that while interest rates are likely to rise gradually over the next year or two, there is no need to panic. We expect government bond yields to rise, but remain very low by historical standards, with ten-year US Treasury yields, for example, unlikely to get much higher than 3% by the end of this year. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a82e627e4b0a97663fa8284\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-13T13:20:54.213Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s inflation figures:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/13/uk-inflation-living-standards-squeeze-brexit-pound\">UK inflation remains at 3% as living standards squeeze continues</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a82e1b5e4b0967c7192f644\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-13T13:19:54.219Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK shares up....but US may fall</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Britain\u2019s stock market is holding onto its earlier gains, and so is the pound.</strong></p> <p>The FTSE 100 is currently up 20 points, or 0.3%, on top of Monday\u2019s 1.2% jump.</p> <p>That\u2019s despite the pound gaining half a cent against the US dollar following the inflation figures (a strong sterling is usually bad for shares).</p> <p>Mining companies are leading the rally, as the weaker US dollar pushes up commodity prices, along with holiday companies after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/feb/13/stock-markets-shares-ftse-uk-inflation-pound-business-live?page=with:block-5a829d3be4b0a97663fa7fb7#block-5a829d3be4b0a97663fa7fb7\">today\u2019s decent results from TUI</a>.</p> <p>This follows a strong day on Wall Street yesterday, and gains across most of Asia earlier on Tuesday.</p> <p>However, European stocks are being dragged down by the strengthening euro (the dollar is getting a kicking generally today).</p> <p>The US stock market opens in just over an hour, and is expected to dip....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/963397876503252992\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US Opening Calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DOW?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DOW</a>  24525  -0.31%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SPX</a>  2649  -0.25%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NASDAQ?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NASDAQ</a>  6509  -0.23%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IGOpeningCall?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#IGOpeningCall</a></p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/963397876503252992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 13, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a82d854e4b0967c7192f5b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-13T12:47:54.072Z\">12.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>In other news (which I missed earlier), UK house prices are rising faster than wages or the headline inflation rate.</strong></p> <p>Average house prices in the UK rose by 5.2% in the year to December 2017, up from 5.0% in November 2017.

Norwegian\u2019s chief executive, Bj\u00f8rn Kjos, said the new route would be followed in June by the setting up of a subsidiary in Argentina, licensed to fly up to 152 routes around the continent. \u201cWe have big plans for Argentina. It\u2019s going to be very interesting to see the onward connections we can offer from a Buenos Aires hub. South America is underserved.\u201d He said Brazil, Chile and Uruguay could also soon be available on low-cost flights from Gatwick. Kjos said: \u201cThe UK will be at the heart of our continued global expansion and we remain fully committed to the market.\u201d The airline has more than 1,000 pilots and crew at Gatwick, where it will base its newest 787s. The airline\u2019s transatlantic expansion will get another lift from 2020 with the delivery of the first versions of the Airbus321neo, which are expected to fly from Gatwick to eastern US cities such as Philadelphia or Detroit. The single-aisle planes are the size of those typically used on European short-haul flights but with a longer range. Investors and rivals have questioned the sustainability of Norwegian, which has rapidly expanded since its creation 15 years ago. It is now Europe\u2019s third biggest low-cost airline. Kjos said: \u201cWhen we started to build up the short-haul network we experienced the same. Last year we took in more than 600 pilots. That is not free. \u201cYes, we could do it at a slower pace \u2013 but then you might not have the [airport] slots in two or three years. It\u2019s tough when you do the expansion. After huge investment you won\u2019t pay it off in a month.\u201d He said the modern fuel-efficient fleet of 787s, allied to the low-cost structures found at short-haul budget airlines, meant they could sell fares advertised from \u00a3260 one way: \u201cI can\u2019t understand how other airlines can do [South American routes] with older aircraft. You burn a hell of a lot of fuel.\u201d Reports in Norway say George Soros\u2019s fund has attempted to short-sell the airline, while the Ryanair boss, Michael O\u2019Leary, predicted that Norwegian and Monarch would not survive the winter. Monarch went into administration in October. Kjos said O\u2019Leary\u2019s comments may have been prompted by Norwegian recruiting between 200 and 300 pilots from Ryanair, which led to a winter crisis for the Irish airline instead. \u201cHe\u2019s been saying that since 2002,\u201d Kjos said. \u201cIt means nothing.\u201d Kjos said the airline was continuing to attract more business passengers and was increasing the size of its premium cabin from 35 to 56 seats on its 787s. Meanwhile, Norwegian is considering further expansion to the far east and south Asia. Kjos said: \u201cWe could fly millions of Asian passengers to London \u2013 Tokyo, Beijing, there\u2019s no exception, everyone wants to fly to London.\u201d However, routes are being held up by the refusal of Russia to grant overflying flights in its trans-Siberian air corridor, despite UK government backing for Norwegian under a bilateral agreement.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "British households remained under significant pressure last month from rising prices as the rate of inflation stayed at its highest level for almost six years, continuing the squeeze on consumers. The consumer price index (CPI) held steady at 3% in January for the second month running, according to the Office for National Statistics, confounding economists\u2019 expectations that the rate would fall to 2.9% as the effects of the post-EU referendum drop in the pound begin to fade. The reading comes after the Bank of England stoked speculation about a rise in interest rates from as early as May by suggesting last week that it would need to increase the cost of borrowing somewhat earlier and to a greater extent than previously expected. The figures show CPI sticking stubbornly above the Bank\u2019s target rate of 2% set by the government. The ONS said the cost of buying tickets for attractions such as zoos and gardens, as well as the price of music downloads and books, had fallen considerably less rapidly than would have been expected at the start of the year. The increasing cost of recreation and culture was partially offset by falling prices for food and non-alcoholic drinks such as tea and coffee, with a particularly sharp fall in the price of meat recorded last month. There was also downward pressure on inflation from a slower rise in the cost of fuel from a year ago. Statisticians said that after rising strongly since around the time of the Brexit vote in the middle of 2016, when the weak pound pushed up the cost of imports to Britain, food price inflation now appeared to be slowing. Economists believe the rate of inflation will gradually fall over the coming months as a consequence. However, Nikesh Sawjani, an economist at Lloyds Bank, said the unchanged CPI reading from December showed the downward trend in inflation was likely to be very gradual. \u201cOver the coming months, as the fading impact of previous sterling weakness unwinds, domestic inflation pressures are expected to build,\u201d he said. The Bank of England has warned that the fading effects from the fall in sterling will be offset by rising oil prices. Although it has begun to fall again in recent weeks, the price of crude has risen by more than 20% over the past six months amid booming global demand from an upswing in economic activity in the eurozone, US and China. Economists are also looking for evidence of increasing wage growth from official figures due to be released next week, which could put further upward pressure on the cost of living as companies increase their prices to accommodate higher wage bills. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has said inflation could rise above 3% over the coming months from a combination of the residual effects of the weak pound and the rising oil price and accelerating global growth that is lifting demand for goods and services. Wage growth has so far proven sluggish, and some economists do not believe workers will see their pay rise above the rate of inflation this year. Peter Dowd, Labour\u2019s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cWith inflation remaining around a five-year high, working people are still seeing their incomes squeezed as wages fail to keep up with prices, and household debt levels soar.\u201d The pound rose against the dollar on international exchanges as investors bet on the increasing likelihood of an earlier rate rise from Threadneedle Street, with sterling hitting $1.39 against the US currency. Financial markets have been thrown into turmoil in recent weeks over growing fears of stubbornly high inflation. Investors are concerned that central banks may need to raise interest rates more quickly than previously thought in order to prevent prices from spiralling out of control. Joel Kruger of currency trading firm LMAX Exchange said: \u201cA prolonged period of subdued inflation around the globe has been a major contributor to record high stock markets \u2026 the reversal of this process should therefore have the opposite effect.\u201d",

Pendragon, which trades under the Evans Halshaw and Stratstone brands and sells all the main marques, said profit before tax fell to \u00a360.4m last year from \u00a375.4m in 2016. Used car revenues rose 15.8% to \u00a32.1bn while new car revenues fell 8.9% to \u00a31.8bn. Along with other dealers and carmakers, Pendragon sold luxury cars at big discounts to clear excess stock in the summer. Following its surprise profit warning in October, the company put its US motor division up for sale in December, hoping to raise more than \u00a3100m. It expects to make a further \u00a3100m from selling a number of its luxury new car showrooms in the UK as part of a shift towards used vehicles. Trevor Finn, the Pendragon chief executive, said the used car market \u2013 which totalled 7.8m vehicles last year \u2013 was more than three times bigger than the new car market and that margins were higher. Pendragon plans to double its share of the used car market to 10% by 2021. It will open outlets that only sell used vehicles in Norwich, Ipswich and Shrewsbury by the end of March, aiming to take the number of used car sites from 27 to 40 over the next three years. The firm is also investing in its website. The UK market for new cars declined last year for the first time since 2011, bringing an end to a boom that had been fuelled by cheap finance and personal contract plans (PCP), which now account for the vast majority of all of new car registrations. That number has been stable, at about 82%. \u201cCustomers who bought cars on this method [PCP] are continuing to buy cars on this method, and repeat the purchase every two to three years,\u201d said Finn. Britain\u2019s car industry body expects demand for new cars to fall by a further 5%-7% this year before recovering next year. It has blamed uncertainty caused by Brexit and the government\u2019s diesel policy. Finn concurred with this forecast, noting that some car manufacturers had started scaling back production in the UK, where demand has waned since hitting a record high in 2016. Shares in Pendragon jumped 17% as investors welcomed the company\u2019s plans.",

About 220 holidaymakers flew from Birmingham to Enfidha airport with the tour operator on Tuesday, with the same number boarding a flight from Manchester later in the day. Another flight to Enfidha will depart from Gatwick airport on Wednesday. It is more than six months after the Foreign Office lifted its advice against non-essential travel to the north African country. All three flights were sold out, with all-inclusive seven-night holidays starting at \u00a3306 per person. Holidaymakers can choose from 10 hotels in the resort of Hammamet and newer Yasmine Hammamet on the north-east coast, as well as Skanes. A total of 14 hotels will be available in the summer. Thomas Cook, one of Europe\u2019s biggest tour operators, will add flights from Glasgow and Newcastle upon Tyne in April and from Stansted in May. It has so far taken 15,000 UK bookings up to the end of the summer. A seven-night Easter holiday at a Thomas Cook hotel in Tunisia costs about \u00a32,000, compared with \u00a33,000 in Gran Canaria. Thomas Cook has continued to sell holidays in Tunisia to German, French and Belgian holidaymakers, whose governments did not warn against travel to the country. Last year it flew nearly 70,000 people to Tunisia, more than half of them from Germany. The year before the 2015 terrorist attack in Sousse that claimed 38 lives and left 39 wounded, 430,000 British holidaymakers had travelled to Tunisia with tour operators.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Network Rail says it will deliver a 15% reduction in train delays and almost 1,000 new services every day by 2021 under a \u00a347.1bn five-year plan. But there are no fresh promises of major projects after massive budgetary overruns in the last five-year plan left many schemes abandoned or delayed. The bulk of the 2019-24 budget will be spent on maintenance, operations and renewals to make the most of the existing railway. The provisional funding announced by government in October means Network Rail expects to have almost 25% more money to spend on day-to-day operations. Just \u00a310.1bn will be available for \u201cenhancements\u201d, or rail upgrades, the majority of which are expected to be works deferred from the 2014-19 plan. The biggest single focus is likely to be the TransPennine line from Leeds to Manchester, where up to 20 schemes could speed up the link at the heart of the north\u2019s rail network. Mark Carne, the chief executive of National Rail, said: \u201cThis way of allocating capital is a much healthier way than it was [for 2014-19]: you\u2019ve got \u00a315bn and a long shopping list of stuff, which was really very immature.\u201d Carne added that he would delay his planned retirement to hand his successor a robust, detailed plan, negotiated and accepted by the regulator and government. The next five years would be fundamentally different from last time when, Carne said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a plan built in the right kind of way.\u201d Poorly costed estimates of major works led to, most notably, the tripling of the budget to electrify the Great Western mainline. Carne said the next business plan, which Network Rail expects to submit by Wednesday for the government and regulator\u2019s approval, was built from the ground up. Last time round, the rail regulator, the ORR, angered Network Rail by slashing about \u00a32bn from the budget to attempt to encourage efficiency. Carne acknowledged that reason for that move by the ORR, saying: \u201cIt was such a high-level plan, it was almost impossible for the regulator to know if it should be better.\u201d He said the level of detail now supplied would make any such reduction more questionable. While flagship projects such as the recent redevelopment of London Bridge are absent from the plans, Network Rail expects to carry out improvements to the TransPennine route between Leeds and Manchester, adding capacity and cutting journey times. Rail passengers in the north have been concerned since the promise of full electrification of the route subsided, when other projects were axed by Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, after the overspend on Great Western. Carne said a menu of options for upgrading the line had been submitted to the Department for Transport, with about 20 separate schemes potentially contributing to improving the line. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated bit of track, which means that all of the problems we had on Great Western in terms of access on a live railway are present.\u201d Grayling could announce his decision on TransPennine upgrades, which are believed to cost between \u00a31bn and \u00a32bn, in March, when he responds to Network Rail\u2019s broader budget plans. The final signoff is due in October. Carne said he would commit to further staff diversity, after 20% more women were hired under his watch. He has a set a target to drive up the number by 50% in the next five years, meaning a quarter of the 38,000 Network Rail employees in a heavily male-dominated industry would be women.",

Just \u00a310.1bn will be available for \u201cenhancements\u201d, or rail upgrades, the majority of which are expected to be works deferred from the 2014-19 plan.

Carne said the next business plan, which Network Rail expects to submit by Wednesday for the government and regulator\u2019s approval, was built from the ground up. Last time round, the rail regulator, the ORR, angered Network Rail by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/12/network-rail-spending-plans-regulator\">slashing about \u00a32bn from the budget</a> to attempt to encourage efficiency. </p> <p>Carne acknowledged that reason for that move by the ORR, saying: \u201cIt was such a high-level plan, it was almost impossible for the regulator to know if it should be better.\u201d He said the level of detail now supplied would make any such reduction more questionable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/12/transport-committee-inquiry-intercity-east-coast\">Transport committee to launch inquiry into InterCity East Coast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While flagship projects such as the recent redevelopment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/04/london-bridge-station-revamp-review\">London Bridge</a> are absent from the plans, Network Rail expects to carry out improvements to the TransPennine route between Leeds and Manchester, adding capacity and cutting journey times. Rail passengers in the north have been concerned since the promise of full electrification of the route subsided, when other projects were axed by Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, after the overspend on Great Western.</p> <p>Carne said a menu of options for upgrading the line had been submitted to the Department for Transport, with about 20 separate schemes potentially contributing to improving the line. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated bit of track, which means that all of the problems we had on Great Western in terms of access on a live railway are present.\u201d</p> <p>Grayling could announce his decision on TransPennine upgrades, which are believed to cost between \u00a31bn and \u00a32bn, in March, when he responds to Network Rail\u2019s broader budget plans. The final signoff is due in October.</p> <p>Carne said he would commit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/26/network-rail-boss-attacks-safety-record-macho-culture\">to further staff diversity</a>, after 20% more women were hired under his watch. He has a set a target to drive up the number by 50% in the next five years, meaning a quarter of the 38,000 Network Rail employees in a heavily male-dominated industry would be women. </p>",

      "bodyText": "A federal environment department investigation into Adani\u2019s failure to disclose its CEO\u2019s link to a mining company convicted of causing serious environmental harm says the failure to disclose \u201cmay have been negligent\u201d. But knowledge of the link would not have altered the decision to grant Carmichael mine ministerial approval, an internal document says. The document, released to the Australia Institute and published by the ABC following a freedom of information request to the federal environment department, is the summary of an investigation conducted by the department following the revelation that the chief executive of Adani Mining, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, had charge of Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) in Zambia when the company pleaded guilty to serious environmental offences, including polluting the major river. The company has no link to Adani apart from Janakaraj\u2019s work history. Janakaraj himself was not charged but was responsible for overall operations at the mine for at least a period of his tenure with the company. In 2015, before granting federal approval for the $16bn Carmichael coalmine and rail project in Queensland\u2019s Galilee Basin, the department wrote to the company to ask if any of its executives had \u201cbeen the subject of any civil or criminal penalties or compliance-related findings, for breaches of, or noncompliance with environmental laws \u2026 [and] information about his or her roles both in Australia and in other countries\u201d. Adani\u2019s response failed to mention Janakaraj\u2019s involvement with KCM. The department\u2019s compliance report, dated 18 December 2015, said it began investigating Adani\u2019s failure to disclose after it was reported by the ABC and found that: \u201cAdani Mining Pty Ltd may have been negligent in failing to disclose a complete account of one of its executive officers in relation to environmental matters.\u201d Adani Mining is an Australian subsidiary of the Adani Group, an Indian multinational. Failing to disclose information upon request, or being negligent about whether material is false or misleading, is an offence under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999. However, the compliance report said the department \u201cfound no evidence that would establish, beyond reasonable doubt as the law requires, that Adani Mining Pty Ltd was reckless in its actions.\u201d It also found that if that information had been provided to the department prior to the project getting federal environmental approval, \u201cthere would not have been a material change to the recommendations made to [the environment minister] with respect to the decision you made on this project\u201d. \u201cThis means that the company\u2019s failure to disclose relevant information would not have resulted in an obvious benefit or advantage,\u201d the report said. The Department of Environment and Energy confirmed on Tuesday that it wrote to Adani \u201ccautioning that the findings of the department\u2019s review, and Adani\u2019s admission, will be taken into account for any future actions under the act\u201d. But in a statement to Guardian Australia, Adani said it did not receive a caution. \u201cThe assessment we received from the department stated: \u2018Our assessment concluded that the omission did not result in environmental harm and, further, that the 36 conditions imposed under the EPBC Act on the Carmichael coalmine and rail project will ensure that Adani will meet the highest environmental standards; the omission was likely due to a mistake and Adani officials provided full cooperation,\u2019\u201d an Adani spokeswoman said. \u201cThe Adani Group has at no time been connected with the Konkola Copper Mine or its listed parent company Vendanta Resources.\u201d The federal Labor party appears ready to withdraw its support for Adani\u2019s controversial Carmichael mine project, which Labor strategists believe is hurting the party in the polls as far south as Victoria. Bill Shorten this month called for an investigation into reports Adani had submitted an altered laboratory report in appealing a $12,000 fine for contaminating wetlands in Queensland in March 2017.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct shoppers will be invited to take a break from browsing for leisurewear to play video games, with the chain unveiling a partnership that will see Game Digital open pay-to-play concessions in its stores. Under the terms of the agreement, Sports Direct, owned by Mike Ashley, hopes to cash in on the growing popularity of eSports by clearing space in stores to host live matches between players battling it out in a variety of competitive video games. Sports Direct, which bought a 25.8% stake in Game Digital in 2017, will also pay \u00a33.2m for 50% of the intellectual property of Belong, the computer game company\u2019s eSports offshoot, and will be entitled to half its profits. The retailer will also provide a \u00a355m loan to Game\u2019s Spanish division to help fund development of more eSports venues in the country. Game Digital said it hoped to capitalise on the overlap between traditional sports and eSports, a fast-growing genre that has attracted sponsorship from major brands and captured the attention of celebrity backers such as the singer Jennifer Lopez and the Formula One driver Fernando Alonso. Global revenues from eSports grew beyond expectations to reach $1.5bn (\u00a31.1bn) last year, and are forecast to be $2.3bn by 2023, according to the gaming research company SuperData. Belong has sought to harness the popularity of eSports by creating \u201ctribes\u201d, groups of gamers clustered around UK cities with team names such as London Lionhearts, Preston Invincibles and Plymouth Armada. They are charged up to \u00a37 an hour to play and can book other experiences such as 10 minutes of virtual reality for \u00a35 or birthday parties. Under its deal with Sports Direct, some of the 16 new Belong arenas planned for this year will be housed within the retail chain\u2019s stores. Game Digital said: \u201cThe arenas provide dedicated space for both PC and console gamers to play with friends, compete in tournaments, enjoy gaming nights, celebrate new games and technology launches, and share game themed events and experiences.\u201d Its chief executive, Martyn Gibbs, said the partnership and loan from Sports Direct would help the company \u201cmove from a seller of physical products to providing gaming experiences\u201d. Game Digital has struggled in recent years as supermarkets and online retailers such as Amazon have muscled into the video game specialist\u2019s market. It has opened 19 Belong venues as part of its plan to make money from an increasing trend among retailers and hospitality venues for offering experiences, alongside their traditional products. The strategy, which has been dubbed \u201cshoppertainment\u201d, has been adopted by major retailers such as John Lewis, which staged an Alice in Wonderland-themed show in its store in Oxford\u2019s Westgate centre. Game Digital launched Belong in 2016 as part of a plan to move away from traditional retail sales and now hopes to accelerate investment, backed by Sports Direct\u2019s money. Revenues from the division doubled last year to \u00a38.7m, according to the company\u2019s annual report, with players typically spending more money than other customers. The average Game Digital customer spent \u00a3165 in its shops last year, but the figure was \u00a3239 among Belong gamers.",

      "bodyText": "MPs have accused the \u201cbig four\u201d accountancy firms of \u201cfeasting on what was soon to become a carcass\u201d as it emerged they banked \u00a372m for work linked to collapsed government contractor Carillion in the years leading up to its financial failure. Less than a fortnight before Carillion\u2019s auditor KPMG is due to face questions from MPs on two select committees, the accountant and rivals Deloitte, EY and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) submitted evidence to the inquiry. Responses to questions from the committees revealed that the quartet of firms issued bills worth \u00a371.6m over 10 years from 2008 for work for Carillion, its pension scheme and its government contracts. Details of accountants\u2019 fees emerged as more than 4,400 former Carillion staff working in prison maintenance, as well as catering and cleaning on military bases were told that they will keep their jobs. The total number of jobs saved has now reached 6,668, more than a third of Carillion\u2019s 19,500-strong workforce. But nearly 1,000 people have already been made redundant, while a further 11,800 staff still face an uncertain future. Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, highlighted the benefits enjoyed by the under-fire accounting profession from work performed for Carillion. \u201cThe image of these companies feasting on what was soon to become a carcass will not be lost on decent citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw at the end of our evidence session [last week] that the former directors of Carillion, unlike their pensioners, suppliers and employees, are alright. \u201cThese figures show that, as ever, the Big Four are alright too. All of them did extensive \u2013 and expensive \u2013 work for Carillion.\u201d He said the fact that PwC was the only major firm that did not have a conflict of interest preventing it from administering Carillion\u2019s liquidation showed the industry was an \u201coligopoly\u201d. Business committee chair Rachel Reeves pointed to the role of KPMG, which signed off Carillion\u2019s last accounts before a profit warning in July last year that saw the outsourcer slash the value of key contracts by \u00a3845m. \u201cEither KPMG failed to spot the warning signs, or its judgement was clouded by its cosy relationship with the company and the multimillion-pound fees it received,\u201d said Reeves. The committees pointed out that three of Carillion\u2019s former finance directors had also worked for big four accountancy firms, two of them at KPMG. \u201cFor the sake of all those who lost their jobs at Carillion and in the interests of better corporate governance KPMG should, as a bare minimum, review its processes and explain what went wrong,\u201d said Reeves. In a letter to the committee, KPMG defended itself, saying that in the construction industry \u2013 a large part of Carillion\u2019s business \u2013 \u201can accumulation of adverse events [...] can quite quickly cause a precipitous decline.\u201d KPMG chairman and senior partner Bill Michael said: \u201cIt does not follow automatically from a company collapse either that the opinion of management was wrong, or that the auditor did a bad job.\u201d said KPMG chairman and senior partner Bill Michael. Executives from KPMG, whose audit of Carillion is already being examined by the Financial Reporting Council, will face questions from the two select committees on 22 February. The other three firms provided breakdowns of work performed for Carillion, both before and after it got into financial difficulty. Criticism of accounting firms came as the official receiver, the arm of the Insolvency Service finding new homes for Carillion\u2019s contracts, raised hopes for 11,800 employees yet to learn their fate. The receiver, which has saved 6,668 jobs so far, said more could be rescued because several companies are interested in taking over former Carillion contracts. But it said a further 59 people have been made redundant, taking the running total of job losses to 989.",
