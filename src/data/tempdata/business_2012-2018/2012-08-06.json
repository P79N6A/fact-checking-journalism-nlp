      "bodyText": "Standard Chartered bank ran a rogue unit that schemed with Iran's government to hide more than $250bn (\u00a3160bn) in illegal transactions for nearly a decade, according to a scathing report by New York regulators that may put intense pressure on the management of the UK-based bank. According to the report filed by the New York state department of financial services (NYSDFS), when warned by a US colleague about dealings with Iran, a Standard Chartered executive caustically replied: \"You f---ing Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we're not going to deal with Iranians.\" About 60,000 transactions were involved between 2001 and 2007 and the bank faces losing its ability to trade in the US if the allegations are proven. The regulator has demanded a meeting with the bank on 15 August and just hours before trading began in its shares in Hong Kong this morning the bank insisted it \"strongly rejects the position or the portrayal of facts as set out\". Shares in the British bank dropped sharply in the final seconds of trading; the accusations were published just as the London stock market was closing. The shares slumped 6% to \u00a314.70 to become the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. The attack on Standard Chartered \u2013 which is accused by the US of \"wilful and egregious violations of law\" \u2013 could be a severe blow to the reputation of the bank which, until last night, had been regarded as the most solid of any of the London-listed banks after the 2008 taxpayer bailouts, the more recent Libor-rigging scandal at Barclays and the money laundering offences at HSBC. Its top management team \u2013 the chief executive, Peter Sands, and the finance director, Richard Meddings \u2013 are held in such regard that only last week they were fending off questions about their potential candidacies for governor of the Bank of England or joining Barclays in the wake of the Libor scandal. The 27-page report claims that Standard Chartered bankers helped Iranian clients skirt US financial sanctions against their country for nearly a decade. Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the NYSDFS, said a Standard Chartered subsidiary in New York had also sought to do business with other US-sanctioned countries, including Libya, Burma and Sudan. It is the latest blow to the reputation of the City, already criticised in Washington following the HSBC money-laundering debacle and JP Morgan's multibillion-dollar trading losses at its London office. \"It seems to be that every big trading disaster happens in London,\" New York congresswoman Carolyn Maloney told a Congressional panel investigating the JP Morgan fiasco in June. The New York regulator has provided emails between members of Standard Chartered staff. In one the head of the US operations warned, among others, the executive director of risk in London, that the dealings with Iran could cause \"very serious or even catastrophic reputational damage\" to the group. The email, dated October 2006, warned: \"There is equally importantly potential of risk of subjecting management in US and London (e.g. you and I) and elsewhere to personal reputational damages and/or serious criminal liability.\" It was this memo that provoked the response about \"you f---ing Americans\". Financial transactions with Iran have been subject to US sanctions since 1979. Limited, highly scrutinised transactions known as \"U-turns\" were allowed as long as the money ended up in non-Iranian banks. In 2008 the US Treasury revoked authorisation for U-turn transactions, because it suspected that Iran was using its banks to finance nuclear weapons and missile programmes, and terrorist groups including Hezbollah and Hamas. According to Lawsky, Standard Chartered set up an operation known as Project Gazelle, aimed at helping Iranian banks put money through the US financial system. The bank is alleged to have removed codes to hide transfers for Iranians. \"For almost 10 years, SCB [Standard Chartered bank] schemed with the government of Iran and hid from regulators roughly 60,000 secret transactions, involving at least $250bn, and reaping SCB hundreds of millions of dollars in fees. \"SCB's actions left the US financial system vulnerable to terrorists, weapons dealers, drug kingpins and corrupt regimes, and deprived law enforcement investigators of crucial information used to track all manner of criminal activity,\" the regulator said. \"In short, SCB operated as a rogue institution.\" In one example from 2001 detailed in the report, Standard Chartered was approached by CBI/Markazi, Iran's central bank, to act as recipient for daily oil sales from the National Iranian Oil Company. Iranians warned the bank that disclosure of their identities to US banks would cause \"unacceptable delays in clearing funds\", according to the report. The bank took legal advice and was told it \"should ascertain that the payments are authorised\", according to the report. Instead, it \"conspired with Iranian clients to transmit misinformation to the New York branch by removing and otherwise misrepresenting wire transfer data that could identify Iranian parties\", the report claims. Standard Chartered, which is one of the top five largest banks in the UK by market value, was unprepared for the scale of the criticism, despite having made disclosures in previous annual reports \u2013 and in its interim report last week \u2013 about discussions with the US over breaking sanctions. The bank stressed that it had complied with the regulations. \"Well over 99.9% of the transactions relating to Iran complied,\" the bank said as Asian markets opened for Tuesday. Discussions continue and the bank said it was \"surprised to receive\" the regulatory order. \"The group takes its responsibilities very seriously and seeks to comply at all times with the relevant laws and regulations,\" the bank said.",

The country's biggest supermarket chain wants to cash in on the rise of smartphone users and has set up 10 screens in the airport's departure lounge with images of its most popular products. Customers can then scan the items with their phone to create a virtual shopping list and order a delivery for shortly after they arrive back home following their break. Currently, nearly one in seven online grocery orders involve the use of a smartphone \u2013 such as an iPhone or Android device \u2013 in an overall market worth an estimated \u00a34.5bn. Tesco controls around half of all online grocery orders. Showing off the new screens at Gatwick's north terminal, where they will be for a two-week trial, internet retailing director Ken Towle said a similar scheme launched last year in South Korea for commuters to order groceries at railway and bus stations had been a huge success. He said: \"We got a lot of interest in our Korean sites and it went viral, so we wanted to see if customers would use this, with a view to launching at more airports.\" Around 50% of the population have a smartphone and this is set to increase to 90% within five years. Tesco relaunched its website this year and said online orders account for \"high-single digits\" of total revenues, thought to be around \u00a35bn a year. On Monday morning not everyone at Gatwick was impressed. Lisa McDougall, 42, who was travelling to Spain with her young family, said: \"I do a lot of online shopping but wouldn't do it at the airport. I couldn't see myself doing the shopping when I'm in holiday mode.\" Mike Cameron, 50, travelling to Edinburgh agreed.

      "standfirst": "It is half a decade this week since the 'world changed', in Adam Applegarth's famous phrase. But what has happened to the architects of economic meltdown? And has anything really changed for them?", 
      "body": "<p>When Adam Applegarth was forced out of a sinking Northern Rock in December 2007, it was amid the kind of numbers that tend to dance in front of your eyes. In the five years running up to the bank's spectacular crash he had been paid around \u00a310m. During the 18 months immediately before he cashed in shares worth \u00a32.6m. On leaving he secured a golden goodbye to be paid in monthly instalments, totalling \u00a3760,000. His pension, payable when he turns 55, is worth \u00a3304,000 a year.</p> <p>The year after his exit he was glimpsed in a very familiar setting, once again turning out for the second XI of his beloved Sunderland Cricket Club. \"This summer,\" said one of his old associates, \"he will be putting his feet up. He is playing an awful lot of cricket, enjoying his motors and travelling.\"</p> <p>In the autumn of 2009 Applegarth became a senior adviser to the American private equity firm Apollo Management, advising a new arm, the European Principal Fund, on the buying-up of distressed debt \u2013 perhaps a field of expertise. Three years on he remains in the job and shielded behind a communications firewall administered by a New York PR firm called Rubenstein Associates, whose other clients include Walt Disney, the Las Vegas Comedy Festival, and the American Kennel Club.</p> <p>When I contacted them, I was handed over to a breathlessly efficient operative called Melissa, who said I should send over my questions. With a view to at least trying to get his attention, I kept them non-confrontational, and short: What does Mr Applegarth's role at Apollo involve? Could he explain how the depth of banks' problems in 2007 first revealed itself to him? And how has his life been since? Twenty-four hours later she called back: \"Put us down for a decline to comment,\" she said.</p> <p>So, on to another lead. In September 2010 it was reported that Applegarth had joined his son Greg in setting up a company called Beechwood Property Management, in which he held 55 of the 100 shares. Their documents list both men's occupation as \"consultant\". Their registered office is on the 11th floor of a gleaming Newcastle office block called Cale Cross House, but when I called the in-house security guard he had never heard of them. In fact, this is merely the address of their accountants \u2013 who passed on a message, with no result.</p> <p>There is no entry for Beechwood Property Management in the phone directory, nor has it a website. On the face of it, it is a ghost outfit, whose existence is only noticeable to those hard-bitten people who pore over records held at Companies House.</p> <p>Such is the great cloud of silence that now surrounds people who were once among the loudest voices in the financial services industry.</p> <p>The reclusive lifestyle of former Royal Bank of Scotland chief Fred Goodwin barely needs mentioning. Steve Crawshaw, who turned Bradford and Bingley from a staid building society into a specialist in self-certified mortgages and left the company weeks before it had to be nationalised, has apparently retired to the Yorkshire countryside: his only publicly-recorded activity these days is as the chair of the advisory board of the School of Management at Bradford University, who forwarded him my list of questions, but I heard nothing back.</p> <p>Even the few who still have heavyweight business roles keep schtum: there may be a beautiful poetry in the fact that the former HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby is now the boss of Coral bookmakers, but getting him to talk is a non-starter. \"As the article does not relate to his current role at Coral he wishes to respectfully decline your request,\" said his spokesman.</p> <p>At the height of a financialised age, it was the done thing to refer to these people as \"Masters Of The Universe\". Five years on, picking through the subsequent career histories of those who sparked first the credit crunch and then the crash, the suggestion of omnipotence sounds absurd. Most of the people at the centre of the events of 2007-8 tend to suggest a much less titanic stereotype: the faded rock star, often still trying to keep their hand in, well aware that the hits have dried up, the old tricks have long since turned embarrassing, and their time has passed.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a very awkward question sits in the public mind: will there ever be any convincing payback?</p> <p>In the US, only a tiny handful of former bankers have been criminally indicted on charges relating to the crash: most notably, Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, two former Bear Stearns employees \u2013 and one-time sub-prime specialists \u2013 who were acquitted of fraud and conspiracy in November 2009. In February this year a civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission was settled on the basis of a $1.05m payout from the two, which the judge in charge termed \"chump change\".</p> <p>The only big figure sent to jail for his part in two decades of crazed speculation and irresponsibility has been Bernie Madoff. By contrast, the people who bundled up the bad debt in arcane financial instruments that pushed the world to the brink of ruin are still out there: hugely diminished \u2013 but free, and hardly penniless.</p> <p>Even those who steered Lehman Brothers into catastrophe and thus started the decisive crash of 2008 seem to have got away with it. In May this year an internal memo from the SEC leaked to Reuters said that after its investigation into the bank it had been \"determined that charges will likely not be recommended\".</p> <p>Which brings us to 780 3rd Avenue in Manhattan, the location of an almost comically dull office block that looks like a giant house brick.</p> <p>Inside is the HQ of Matrix Advisors. Its founder is a byword for the events of 2007-8: Dick Fuld, the CEO of Lehmans, until its cataclysmic demise. Back then, he was the pumped-up corporate icon once known as \"the Gorilla\", the man who summed up his business style with the boast that he wanted to reach into the bodies of Lehmans' competitors, \"rip out their hearts and eat it in front of them before they die\".</p> <p>These days he apparently flits between New York and his homes in Florida and Sun Valley, Idaho \u2013 on bog-standard commercial flights, according to witnesses \u2013 looking after a tiny outfit which provides \"strategic advice to client management teams and senior employees \u2026 across all aspects of business\". One source close to Fuld has said that the workforce extends to \"a young guy from Lehman and two secretaries\". When I called their office, I therefore had the tantalising sense that the figure most indelibly associated with the crash might only be a few yards from the person parrying my questions. Her name was Carla Schiavo: she suggested I send over a few lines of inquiry.</p> <p>What, I asked, does Mr Fuld's work at Matrix Advisors involve? What are his views on the aftermath of the credit crunch and how banks and regulators have responded? What did the financial services industry need to do to recover its esteem? Eventually, Schiavo pointed me in the direction of Fuld's lawyer, a former president of the New York Bar Association named Patricia Hynes \u2013 who, predictably enough, did not deign to reply to either phone calls or emails.</p> <p>Two months ago Fuld was seen at an ice hockey game between the New Jersey Rangers and the New York Devils. An eyewitness reported on the scene for the Wall Street news and gossip site Dealbreaker: \"He was with two goons who were clearly his bodyguards, one sitting next to him in a tan jacket and the other one standing behind him in black. Fuld was wearing a suit \u2026 I guess to try and look like he actually has a job he was coming from before the game.\"</p> <p>Documents filed with US regulators two years ago said Fuld's work at his new venture stretched to around 60 hours a week. Such hard graft may be a necessity: proof, as with the sale of his Park Avenue apartment three years ago (for $25.87m) that he may not be enjoying quite the life of unending luxury that some would imagine, and setting money aside for future litigation, which has so far been met from the coffers of Lehmans' insurers. There is also an abiding sense of twitchiness. When a reporter doorstepped him three years ago, he blurted out: \"You don't have a gun. That's good.\"</p> <p>For others who were intimately involved in the crash, there is a similar sense of shrunken lives, and mouths sealed shut. Kathleen Corbet was the president of the hugely important ratings agency Standard &amp; Poors, but quit in August 2007 just as it started to become clear that the safe-as-houses triple-A ratings given to mortgage-backed securities had turned out to be illusory. She is now in charge of Cross Ridge Capital, a small private equity firm based in New Canaan, Connecticut \u2013 and did not respond to messages asking for her take on what happened in 2007 onwards, and what has transpired since.</p> <p>Neither did Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg, who pumped up AIG to the point that the American group became the biggest insurance company in the world \u2013 only to watch it plunge towards bankruptcy and become 80% nationalised by the US government.</p> <p>He resigned two years before the start of the crash, in 2005, in the midst of the accounting scandal that began the firm's nosedive \u2013 but the fact that he avoided direct involvement in the crash presumably accounts for the fact that in controlled circumstances, he can speak with a belligerence that might suggest the events of 2007-8 never happened.</p> <p>\"We now have huge government, which is not the creator of opportunity \u2013 it's the private sector that creates opportunity, so our basic values are under attack,\" he recently said, warning against the prospect of \"regulating ourselves out of business\". By way of putting his money where his mouth is, Greenberg is suing the US state for $25bn, alleging that AIG's board was \"coerced\" into turning over control of the company to the federal government.</p> <p>Such a high-profile action contrasts with the post-crash story of his old AIG colleague Joseph Cassano \u2013 the man who sold credit default swaps in London to keep the money coming in, and thereby pushed the company towards such ruin that it needed \u00a3182bn of US taxpayers' money to keep it alive. Back then, Cassano lived in an opulent townhouse behind Harrod's. He has since moved back to Westport, on Long Island Sound, where he is apparently unemployed, and uncontactable.</p> <p>But if there is one man who remains the best embodiment of all the delusion and absurdity that led to the crash, it is 74-year-old Angelo Mozilo, the son of a Bronx butcher, a man so tanned that his skin looks like an orange dipped in toffee. Until July 2008 he was the chairman and chief executive of Countrywide Financial, the USA's biggest provider of sub-prime mortgages. Between 2001 and 2006 he took home something in the region of $470m.</p> <p>The company crashed from August 2007 onwards, finally being bought out by the Bank Of America. In a civil case that ended in October 2010 Mozilo settled with the SEC to pay $22.5m to cover allegations of fraud and insider trading, with a further $45m going to his company's former shareholders to cover \"ill-gotten gains\", to be taken from BoA and Countrywide's insurers.</p> <p>The SEC's director of enforcement said this: \"Mozilo's record penalty is the fitting outcome for a corporate executive who deliberately disregarded his duties to investors by concealing what he saw from inside the executive suite \u2013 a looming disaster in which Countrywide was buckling under the weight of increasingly risky mortgage underwriting, mounting defaults and delinquencies, and a deteriorating business model.\" At the same time, Mozilo was cashing in shares to the tune of $285m.</p> <p>Last year a criminal investigation into Mozilo's activities was shelved. But the intrigue swirling around him will not go away: four years after stories about his firm's dealings with American lawmakers first appeared in the media, a Congressional Committee has alleged that Mozilo ran a \"Friends of Angelo\" unit to grant influential members of congress preferential loans, and thereby subdue any drive to rein in his very risky kind of business.</p> <p>The impact of what Mozilo and his company did cannot be overstated: it was Countrywide that led the drive to drown the international financial system in bad debt, while he was paying himself spectacular amounts of money. In Wall Street, the City and beyond, the result of what he and his colleagues were doing was a deathly panic, and the end of the boom years; in the real world, millions of people had their homes repossessed or lost their jobs and now we labour under the austerity cuts that still grip the Western economies like a vice.</p> <p>In May this year a piece in the LA Times reported that Mozilo and his wife Phyllis had sold their home in Thousand Oaks, 29 miles west of near LA, for $2.9m. It described a \"Georgian Colonial-style two-storey\" property, sitting above the second fairway at the Sherwood Country Club, complete with \"a cherry-finished library-office, five bedrooms, six bathrooms and an oversized four-car garage\", along with \"an infinity pool, spa, lawn and a built-in barbecue\".</p> <p>Reading it, you wondered if perhaps, in their own way, the Mozilos were feeling the pinch. And then came the last sentence, and the sickly scent of the high life, uninterrupted: \"They hold other southern California properties in trust, in Riverside and Santa Barbara counties.\"</p>",

Steve Crawshaw, who turned Bradford and Bingley from a staid building society into a specialist in self-certified mortgages and left the company weeks before it had to be nationalised, has apparently retired to the Yorkshire countryside: his only publicly-recorded activity these days is as the chair of the advisory board of the School of Management at Bradford University, who forwarded him my list of questions, but I heard nothing back. Even the few who still have heavyweight business roles keep schtum: there may be a beautiful poetry in the fact that the former HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby is now the boss of Coral bookmakers, but getting him to talk is a non-starter. \"As the article does not relate to his current role at Coral he wishes to respectfully decline your request,\" said his spokesman. At the height of a financialised age, it was the done thing to refer to these people as \"Masters Of The Universe\". Five years on, picking through the subsequent career histories of those who sparked first the credit crunch and then the crash, the suggestion of omnipotence sounds absurd. Most of the people at the centre of the events of 2007-8 tend to suggest a much less titanic stereotype: the faded rock star, often still trying to keep their hand in, well aware that the hits have dried up, the old tricks have long since turned embarrassing, and their time has passed. Meanwhile, a very awkward question sits in the public mind: will there ever be any convincing payback? In the US, only a tiny handful of former bankers have been criminally indicted on charges relating to the crash: most notably, Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, two former Bear Stearns employees \u2013 and one-time sub-prime specialists \u2013 who were acquitted of fraud and conspiracy in November 2009. In February this year a civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission was settled on the basis of a $1.05m payout from the two, which the judge in charge termed \"chump change\". The only big figure sent to jail for his part in two decades of crazed speculation and irresponsibility has been Bernie Madoff. By contrast, the people who bundled up the bad debt in arcane financial instruments that pushed the world to the brink of ruin are still out there: hugely diminished \u2013 but free, and hardly penniless. Even those who steered Lehman Brothers into catastrophe and thus started the decisive crash of 2008 seem to have got away with it. In May this year an internal memo from the SEC leaked to Reuters said that after its investigation into the bank it had been \"determined that charges will likely not be recommended\". Which brings us to 780 3rd Avenue in Manhattan, the location of an almost comically dull office block that looks like a giant house brick. Inside is the HQ of Matrix Advisors. Its founder is a byword for the events of 2007-8: Dick Fuld, the CEO of Lehmans, until its cataclysmic demise. Back then, he was the pumped-up corporate icon once known as \"the Gorilla\", the man who summed up his business style with the boast that he wanted to reach into the bodies of Lehmans' competitors, \"rip out their hearts and eat it in front of them before they die\". These days he apparently flits between New York and his homes in Florida and Sun Valley, Idaho \u2013 on bog-standard commercial flights, according to witnesses \u2013 looking after a tiny outfit which provides \"strategic advice to client management teams and senior employees \u2026 across all aspects of business\". One source close to Fuld has said that the workforce extends to \"a young guy from Lehman and two secretaries\". When I called their office, I therefore had the tantalising sense that the figure most indelibly associated with the crash might only be a few yards from the person parrying my questions. Her name was Carla Schiavo: she suggested I send over a few lines of inquiry. What, I asked, does Mr Fuld's work at Matrix Advisors involve? What are his views on the aftermath of the credit crunch and how banks and regulators have responded? What did the financial services industry need to do to recover its esteem? Eventually, Schiavo pointed me in the direction of Fuld's lawyer, a former president of the New York Bar Association named Patricia Hynes \u2013 who, predictably enough, did not deign to reply to either phone calls or emails. Two months ago Fuld was seen at an ice hockey game between the New Jersey Rangers and the New York Devils. An eyewitness reported on the scene for the Wall Street news and gossip site Dealbreaker: \"He was with two goons who were clearly his bodyguards, one sitting next to him in a tan jacket and the other one standing behind him in black. Fuld was wearing a suit \u2026 I guess to try and look like he actually has a job he was coming from before the game.\" Documents filed with US regulators two years ago said Fuld's work at his new venture stretched to around 60 hours a week. Such hard graft may be a necessity: proof, as with the sale of his Park Avenue apartment three years ago (for $25.87m) that he may not be enjoying quite the life of unending luxury that some would imagine, and setting money aside for future litigation, which has so far been met from the coffers of Lehmans' insurers. There is also an abiding sense of twitchiness. When a reporter doorstepped him three years ago, he blurted out: \"You don't have a gun. That's good.\" For others who were intimately involved in the crash, there is a similar sense of shrunken lives, and mouths sealed shut. Kathleen Corbet was the president of the hugely important ratings agency Standard &amp; Poors, but quit in August 2007 just as it started to become clear that the safe-as-houses triple-A ratings given to mortgage-backed securities had turned out to be illusory. She is now in charge of Cross Ridge Capital, a small private equity firm based in New Canaan, Connecticut \u2013 and did not respond to messages asking for her take on what happened in 2007 onwards, and what has transpired since. Neither did Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg, who pumped up AIG to the point that the American group became the biggest insurance company in the world \u2013 only to watch it plunge towards bankruptcy and become 80% nationalised by the US government. He resigned two years before the start of the crash, in 2005, in the midst of the accounting scandal that began the firm's nosedive \u2013 but the fact that he avoided direct involvement in the crash presumably accounts for the fact that in controlled circumstances, he can speak with a belligerence that might suggest the events of 2007-8 never happened. \"We now have huge government, which is not the creator of opportunity \u2013 it's the private sector that creates opportunity, so our basic values are under attack,\" he recently said, warning against the prospect of \"regulating ourselves out of business\". By way of putting his money where his mouth is, Greenberg is suing the US state for $25bn, alleging that AIG's board was \"coerced\" into turning over control of the company to the federal government. Such a high-profile action contrasts with the post-crash story of his old AIG colleague Joseph Cassano \u2013 the man who sold credit default swaps in London to keep the money coming in, and thereby pushed the company towards such ruin that it needed \u00a3182bn of US taxpayers' money to keep it alive. Back then, Cassano lived in an opulent townhouse behind Harrod's. He has since moved back to Westport, on Long Island Sound, where he is apparently unemployed, and uncontactable. But if there is one man who remains the best embodiment of all the delusion and absurdity that led to the crash, it is 74-year-old Angelo Mozilo, the son of a Bronx butcher, a man so tanned that his skin looks like an orange dipped in toffee. Until July 2008 he was the chairman and chief executive of Countrywide Financial, the USA's biggest provider of sub-prime mortgages. Between 2001 and 2006 he took home something in the region of $470m. The company crashed from August 2007 onwards, finally being bought out by the Bank Of America. In a civil case that ended in October 2010 Mozilo settled with the SEC to pay $22.5m to cover allegations of fraud and insider trading, with a further $45m going to his company's former shareholders to cover \"ill-gotten gains\", to be taken from BoA and Countrywide's insurers. The SEC's director of enforcement said this: \"Mozilo's record penalty is the fitting outcome for a corporate executive who deliberately disregarded his duties to investors by concealing what he saw from inside the executive suite \u2013 a looming disaster in which Countrywide was buckling under the weight of increasingly risky mortgage underwriting, mounting defaults and delinquencies, and a deteriorating business model.\" At the same time, Mozilo was cashing in shares to the tune of $285m. Last year a criminal investigation into Mozilo's activities was shelved. But the intrigue swirling around him will not go away: four years after stories about his firm's dealings with American lawmakers first appeared in the media, a Congressional Committee has alleged that Mozilo ran a \"Friends of Angelo\" unit to grant influential members of congress preferential loans, and thereby subdue any drive to rein in his very risky kind of business. The impact of what Mozilo and his company did cannot be overstated: it was Countrywide that led the drive to drown the international financial system in bad debt, while he was paying himself spectacular amounts of money. In Wall Street, the City and beyond, the result of what he and his colleagues were doing was a deathly panic, and the end of the boom years; in the real world, millions of people had their homes repossessed or lost their jobs and now we labour under the austerity cuts that still grip the Western economies like a vice. In May this year a piece in the LA Times reported that Mozilo and his wife Phyllis had sold their home in Thousand Oaks, 29 miles west of near LA, for $2.9m. It described a \"Georgian Colonial-style two-storey\" property, sitting above the second fairway at the Sherwood Country Club, complete with \"a cherry-finished library-office, five bedrooms, six bathrooms and an oversized four-car garage\", along with \"an infinity pool, spa, lawn and a built-in barbecue\". Reading it, you wondered if perhaps, in their own way, the Mozilos were feeling the pinch. And then came the last sentence, and the sickly scent of the high life, uninterrupted: \"They hold other southern California properties in trust, in Riverside and Santa Barbara counties.\"",

      "bodyText": "It is tempting to regard the self-inflicted explosion at US broker Knight Capital as little more than an entertaining tale of what can happen when computers are given too much power. A glitch in the automation process generated thousands of mistaken orders for stocks and, in 45 minutes last week, Knight ran up a devastating $440m loss. The events clearly represent a disaster for Knight's shareholders \u2013 the firm had to be rescued on Monday by a four-strong consortium of backers at a knock-down price. But has anybody else, apart from Knight's employees, suffered serious harm? Well, yes, they have. The problem is that computer-inspired disasters are happening too often, especially in the US. The botched Facebook flotation caused a $356m loss at UBS, for which the Swiss bank is suing Nasdaq.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "General Motors deliberately drove Saab into bankruptcy, the Swedish car firm's former owner claimed in a $3bn lawsuit filed on Monday. Spyker NV, which bought Saab from GM in 2010 for $74m, filed the claim in the US firm's home state of Michigan. Saab declared bankruptcy just over a year after the deal was done, unable to pay its suppliers or employees and leaving debts of $2bn. According to the Netherlands-based sports car manufacturer, GM sealed Saab's fate by sabotaging a deal with Chinese investors in order to prevent Saab from competing against the US firm in China, a fast-growing market for the car firm. \"This lawsuit seeks redress for the unlawful actions GM took to avoid competition with Saab Automobile in the Chinese market,\" Spyker said in a statement. \"GM's actions had the direct and intended objective of driving Saab Automobile into bankruptcy, a result of GM's tortuously interfering with a transaction between Saab Automobile, Spyker and Chinese investor Youngman that would have permitted Saab Automobile to restructure and remain a solvent, going concern,\" Spyker said. GM responded to the lawsuit saying: \"We will vigorously defend the company against these baseless allegations.\" \"They [GM] had it coming,\" Spyker chief executive Victor Muller told Reuters. \"They never thought we would survive. Well Spyker's still here. They assumed Spyker would end up in the graveyard with Saab and obviously that didn't happen.\" As Saab headed for bankruptcy Spyker tried to set up rescue deals with various investors, including China's Pang Da Automobile Trade Co, and Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile Co. GM effectively ended the investment after it said it would stop supplying technology and vehicles to Saab's owners. Muller told reporters that the $3bn claim was based on what Saab would have been worth if a deal with Chinese investors had gone ahead. \"GM created the appearance of initially encouraging Saab to enter into a deal with Chinese investors to save the company, only later to unlawfully pull the rug out from under Saab, driving it into bankruptcy liquidation,\" Spyker said in its complaint, filed in United States district court in Michigan. \"Indeed, it was GM's intent by whatever means necessary to quash any financing or investment deal that could save Saab from liquidation, because GM simply sought to eliminate Saab from competition, particularly in the Chinese automobile market,\" the complaint said. GM bought 50% of Saab in 1989 for $600m, exercising an option to become its full owner in 2000. But attempts to introduce new models to the US market met with failure and by 2008, as GM struggled across its businesses, the brand was put under review. Talks with firms including BMW, Fiat, Hyundai and Tata Motors went nowhere and the company went into bankruptcy, as did GM. \"We owe it to our stakeholders and ourselves that justice is done and we will pursue this lawsuit with the same tenacity and perseverance that we had when we tirelessly worked to save Saab Automobile, until GM destroyed those efforts and deliberately drove Saab Automobile into bankruptcy,\" said Muller.",

Richard Schulze, the company's former chairman, owns more than 20% of the chain and his offer values Best Buy at $8.84bn.</p> <p>\"There is no question that now is the moment of truth for Best Buy and that immediate and substantial changes are needed for the company to return to its market-leading ways,\" Schulze said. \"After assessing all of my options, it is my strong belief that Best Buy's best chance for renewed success is to implement with urgency the necessary changes as a private company.\"</p> <p>Best Buy said it would comment \"in due course\".</p> <p>Schulze, who was chief executive for 36 years, said in June he would step down as chairman and resign from the company's board to explore his options. The offer, worth $24 to $26 a share, represents a premium of 36% to 47% to Best Buy's closing price Friday.

      "bodyText": "The founder of Best Buy, the troubled big-box electronic retailer, has made a bid to take the company private. The world's largest electronics store chain has seen off its major real world rivals including Circuit City but has struggled to compete with online retailers like Amazon. Richard Schulze, the company's former chairman, owns more than 20% of the chain and his offer values Best Buy at $8.84bn. \"There is no question that now is the moment of truth for Best Buy and that immediate and substantial changes are needed for the company to return to its market-leading ways,\" Schulze said. \"After assessing all of my options, it is my strong belief that Best Buy's best chance for renewed success is to implement with urgency the necessary changes as a private company.\" Best Buy said it would comment \"in due course\". Schulze, who was chief executive for 36 years, said in June he would step down as chairman and resign from the company's board to explore his options. The offer, worth $24 to $26 a share, represents a premium of 36% to 47% to Best Buy's closing price Friday. Shares rose by more than 17% to $20.56 in early trading. The Best Buy chain started life in 1966 as a single stereo shop called the Sound of Music in St Paul, Minnesota. Schulze turned that store into the world's largest consumer-electronics retailer with 167,000 employees and $5bn in annual sales. In 2008 the chain made a $1.34bn (then \u00a31bn) investment in Carphone Warehouse in the UK, as part of a plan to open branches of Best Buy across Britain.
