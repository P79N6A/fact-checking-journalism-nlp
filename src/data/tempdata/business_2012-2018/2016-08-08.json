      "bodyText": "Warm weather and heavy discounts have helped drive a rebound in retail sales, potentially tempering fears of the UK economy grinding to a halt following the Brexit vote. Figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC), published on Tuesday, showed that the value of online and high street sales rose at the fastest pace for six months in the four weeks to 30 July. The statistics chime with other signs that shoppers shrugged off the EU referendum result and continued spending in the weeks that followed. But economists have warned against reading too much into early indicators, while the Bank of England has predicted that growth will slow sharply over coming months, despite cutting interest rates to a record low. July sales were up by 1.1% on a year earlier in like-for-like terms, according to the BRC\u2019s monthly sales monitor, compiled with consultants KPMG. This marked a recovery from the 0.5% fall witnessed in June and was the strongest performance since January. In total terms, not adjusting for the effect of new store openings, sales rose by 1.9% in July, also the strongest growth since January. The figures support consumer spending data from Visa and Barclaycard, which suggested that shopping, day trips and nights out were little affected in the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave the EU. However, they contrast with a survey from the CBI showing that retail sales volumes declined in July and a poll from market researchers GfK, which found that consumer confidence had tumbled. Surveys of businesses are also gloomier, signalling a decrease in activity across services, manufacturing and construction since the referendum on 23 June. The BRC said the Brexit vote would pose a challenge for retailers in the months ahead, but for now, shoppers appeared to be taking a \u201clife goes on\u201d approach. \u201cThis month\u2019s solid sales figures may come as a shock to some, given the slew of early indicators suggesting that consumer activity was slowing in the wake of the referendum result,\u201d said the BRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson. \u201cHowever, little has materially changed for most UK households [since] 23 June, so it is not surprising to us that sales are simply responding to their normal underlying drivers.\u201d Reflecting the pattern of low inflation throughout 2016, the BRC said retailers were continuing to rely on promotions to keep people shopping. Intense price competition has made it hard for retailers to grow their takings and the BRC\u2019s measure of sales growth on a 12-month average basis held at 1.2% in July, the weakest since May 2009, when the UK was mired in recession. Dickinson said the big question for retailers was whether the stronger performance in July could be carried forward into full price sales. A mini heatwave last month helped raise food and drink sales for barbecues and picnics, and also lifted fashion sales, the BRC said. There was also evidence of a boost to retailers and tourism from the weaker pound, which has fallen sharply since the referendum. Holidays, as a result, are more expensive for Britons going abroad, but coming to the UK is cheaper for foreign tourists. The BRC report noted a pickup in sales of jewellery and watches as some tourists were drawn to the UK for shopping splurges. Separate figures suggested that flight bookings to the UK jumped after the referendum, driven by demand from customers in the US and Asia Pacific. In the 28 days before the vote, flight reservations had been down 2.8% year on year. However, in the month after the referendum, they were up by 4.3%, according to travel research company ForwardKeys. Spending was also helped last month by people finding money to go out with friends and family, despite feeling more nervous about the economic outlook, according to figures from Barclaycard. It reported that consumer spending grew by 2.6% in July on a year earlier, but this was down from growth of 3.6% in May and June. Spending in pubs was up by 12.2%, restaurants enjoyed a 12.8% rise and cinema spending increased by 10.1%, as Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie and Ghostbusters helped draw in customers, following a lull in June. Barclaycard also polled 1,680 people to gauge consumer confidence, of whom 63% said they had carried on spending as they did before the Brexit vote. But half of those polled said they were not confident in their ability to spend more on nonessential items, the highest proportion since February. Paul Lockstone, the managing director of corporate affairs at Barclaycard, said: \u201cThese are the first full month\u2019s figures since the EU referendum, so it\u2019s too early to say if this is the start of a long-term trend, but it seems likely consumers will be watching the external environment carefully ahead of any major spending decisions.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union may have been a shock, but a prolonged period of warm weather in July was even more unexpected. At least that is what the latest retail sales figures show. Like-for-like retail sales, which excludes newly opened or closed stores, rose by 1.1% in July, while total sales rose by 1.9%. This was the best performance since January according to the British Retail Consortium and KPMG index. The increase suggests there has been no post-referendum drop-off in consumer spending, despite surveys forecasting that the confidence of business and households have taken a hit. However, this should not be a surprise. Firstly, more than half of voters wanted Brexit. It is an obvious statement but one worth remembering when considering the potential damage to the economy from the vote. The 52% who voted for Brexit presumably did not think that they would be worse of as a result, so they will be less inclined to rein in spending then those who wanted to stay in the EU. In fact, some Brexiters may have celebrated the result by spending a few bob on a nice bottle of bubbly. As it stands, of course, nothing has actually changed yet. Britain is still a member of the EU. The impact on household spending may not filter down until businesses actually pull operations out of the country or cut jobs. Secondly, though, the warm weather in July offset any underlying shift in consumer sentiment. Retail sales figures for the UK are notoriously volatile, with the BRC and KPMG report considered the most accurate of a mixed bunch by retailers. However, trends are easily identifiable, and those in the July report show a textbook British reaction to a heatwave \u2013 spending on summer clothing, picnic and barbecue food went up, and spending on furniture went down. Food enjoyed its best sales performance since November 2013, excluding distortions for the timing of Easter. In contrast, furniture fell from being the best-performing retail category in the year so far to just the fourth best. After all, who wants to do DIY inside when the sun is shining? There is one intriguing titbit in the figures that will be worth watching in the coming month \u2013 sales of jewellery and watches rose sharply in July, making it the best performing retail category. BRC and KPMG claim this is at least partly because of international consumers taking advantage of the weakness of sterling to buy luxury items. However, Eid also took place in July, which will have boosted the market. It will be interesting to see whether the luxury market can sustain this performance. If it does, then it could offset the effects of a Brexit slump if one hits households when the warm weather inevitably disappears. National living wage vs executive pay The trade associations who have written to the government calling for the national living wage to be reconsidered could not have timed their letter worse. Their intervention was revealed on the same day that the High Pay Centre reported that the average pay for FTSE 100 chief executives rose 10% last year to \u00a35.5m. Company bosses now earn 129 times more than their employees. The disparity between the national living wage letter and executive pay is staggering. The trade bodies want Greg Clark, the new business secretary, to slow or scrap the scheduled increase in the national living wage from \u00a37.20 an hour now to more than \u00a39 by 2020. The initiative was introduced by George Osborne and establishes a new level of base pay for workers over 25. If it does reach \u00a39 then it will be one of the highest minimum wages in the developed world. To be fair, some of the organisations behind the letter represent small businesses, convenience stores, pubs and farms. They are concerned about the economic uncertainty caused by the result of the EU referendum and are keen to keep their costs under control. However, the national living wage must not fall victim to Brexit. The policy was a small step towards closing the grotesque gap between the pay of workers and their bosses. Any change would send a terrible message. Theresa May has already said she wants the economy to work \u201cfor all, not just the few\u201d. The new prime minister should be looking at ways to increase the national living wage further and clampdown on executive pay, not vice-versa. Southern strike The new five-day strike by workers on the Southern rail network does not reflect well on the RMT trade union, Govia Thameslink, the company that holds the franchise, or the government. The long-running saga is a national embarrassment. Not one of those parties has done enough to resolve the dispute, which revolves around the phasing out of conductors on trains. The RMT claims that the safety of commuters will be put at risk by conductors being removed from trains, but their safety is more at risk from having to squeeze on overcrowded trains during the dispute. As for Govia Thameslink, when the dust finally settles from this dispute, they should lose the franchise. They have been unable to cooperate with trade unions and their workforce, which is surely a vital component of any service.",

      "bodyText": "Walmart is buying Jet.com, an online retailer less than two years old, for more than $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) as it attempts to rebuild its internet retailing strategy to try to catch up with Amazon. The big box store giant, which operates more than 11,000 stores across the world, including Asda in the UK, on Monday said said the total $3.3bn purchase represented \u201canother jolt of entrepreneurial spirit being injected into Walmart\u201d. The entrepreneurial spirit comes in the form of Marc Lore, Jet\u2019s 45-year-old founder and chief executive, who will join Walmart in a senior role as part of the deal. Lore, who started Jet in 2014 after selling his previous company to Amazon for $550m, is in line to collect as much as $825m from this deal as he still owns 25% of Jet, according to Recode.

The Arkansas-based company is expected to axe its current president of e-commerce, Neil Ashe. Lore, a 45-year-old serial entrepreneur from Staten Island, said: \u201cWe started Jet with the vision of creating a new shopping experience. I couldn\u2019t be more excited that we will be joining with Walmart to help fuel the realization of that vision.\u201d Analysts say Walmart\u2019s acquisition of the loss-making startup is an admittance that the retailer\u2019s online efforts are failing to make headway. Walmart was very slow to the online shopping revolution now dominated by Amazon, and the gap between them has grown: Walmart currently has a stock market value of $230bn, compared to Amazon\u2019s $365bn. \u201cI think it\u2019s an admission that they [Walmart] never really got off to a flying start with online; they never had the growth they should have had,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail analyst service Conlumino. \u201cWalmart\u2019s aim should have been: we are the biggest retailer in the world \u2013 we want to be the biggest online retailer in the world. \u201cInstead, [online] growth has taken a lot longer to come through than they would like. Walmart is under the average growth rate of the market, so they are definitely losing [market] share online. It means in some [product categories], they are losing share overall as people stop buying some products in stores in favor of online.\u201d Walmart\u2019s online sales came to about $14bn last year, compared with $99bn at Amazon. Doug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s president and CEO, said: \u201cWe believe the acquisition of Jet accelerates our progress across these priorities. Walmart.com will grow faster, the seamless shopping experience we\u2019re pursuing will happen quicker, and we\u2019ll enable the Jet brand to be even more successful in a shorter period of time. Our customers will win.

When he started, Jet Lore told Bloomberg he had \u201cno bad feelings toward Jeff and Amazon\u201d, but he wanted to create a online retail challenger aimed at more price-sensitive consumers \u2013 and one that treated its staff with civility. At Jet, staff members are not required to sign non-compete agreements, and board presentations are posted online for all staff to see. \u201cWhat goes around comes around,\u201d Lore said. \u201cThere\u2019s more loyalty and trust that is built [by valuing and trusting employees].\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Eurozone shakes off Brexit fears, but Chinese trade figures disappoint \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The summer lull is in full swing, so let\u2019s quickly recap. China has reignited concerns over global economic growth, after posting disappointing trade figures. The 4.4% drop in exports suggests world demand is weakening, while the 12.5% tumble in imports is a reminder that China\u2019s economy is slowing. Economists expect Beijing to weaken the yuan, in an attempt to stimulate its economy. Eurozone investors have shrugged off the shock of Britain\u2019s Brexit vote, according to the latest morale survey from Sentix. And Brits also defied slowdown concerns in July, spending more in the shops: Britain\u2019s bosses are back in the fat-cat house, after research showed their salaries jumped by 10% last year. Some employees seem more concerned that they may pay their poorest employees too much; they\u2019re lobbying against planned increases in the National Living Wage. The government, though, says it\u2019s committed to boosting the take-home pay of those at the bottom. On a lighter note, we also enjoyed seeing Bank of England governor Mark Carney glittered up at a swanky festival, and learning that Financial Times editor Lionel Barber is being honoured by Paris (but apparently it\u2019s a secret.... ) And with little corporate news around, the FTSE 100 index hit a new 14-month high this morning. But it\u2019s now up just 1 point, a clear sign that we should shut up shop :) See you in the morning.... GW Britain will be the worst-performing advanced economy this quarter, as the Brexit vote hits the country\u2019s economic output. That\u2019s according to JP Morgan, which predicts UK GDP will fall by 0.5% in July-September, before recovering the lost ground in the final three months of 2016 Warm congratulations to the Financial Times\u2019s editor, Lionel Barber, who has been granted France\u2019s highest honour, to become Chevalier in the Ordre National de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur. Barber has been recognised for his \u201cremarkable career\u201d, his \u201ccontribution to high-quality journalism, and the Financial Times\u2019 positive role in the European debate\u201d. Worthy recognition for a long run at the top of British media, at a time of unprecedented change. However, he\u2019s not going to pick up any prizes for social network skills. Barber accidentally leaked the news himself today, in a direct message that went to all his 37,000 followers. He quickly deleted it. But not quickly enough.... Wal-Mart, the US shopping mega-giant, has just snapped up e-commerce site Jet.com for $3bn. It\u2019s another gobbet of news to brighten up a quiet day, but a pretty small deal by Wal-Mart\u2019s standards: Good news for low-paid workers. The British government hasn\u2019t abandoned its plan to raise the minimum wage over the next few years, despite this pressure from business groups. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \u201cThe Government is committed to building an economy that works for all and ensuring that the National Living Wage works for employees as well as businesses of all sizes, and will continue to back small firms to grow and create jobs by providing an environment in which they can thrive. \u201cThe Low Pay Commission plays a critical role in providing recommendations for National Minimum Wage rates, and now has additional responsibilities to help deliver the National Living Wage. The Government has asked the Low Pay Commission to recommend increases to the National Living Wage towards 60% of median earnings by 2020, subject to sustained economic growth.\u201d Another reminder of how China\u2019s economy has looked sluggish for some time... Up in Scotland, oil exploration firm Transocean has confirmed that one of its rigs has been blown back onto the coast while being towed. It says that: During severe weather, the Transocean Winner lost its tow, and subsequently grounded off the Western Isles of Scotland. Fortunately, no personnel are at risk, the company says. And here it is, off the Isle of Lewis: Readers may remember that Transocean owned the Deepwater Horizon exploration rig, which caught fire and sunk in 2011 with the loss of 11 lives, causing the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster. In \u201cnews I missed earlier\u201d, eurozone investors appear to have shaken off their initial panic over Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. The Frankfurt-based Sentix research group\u2019s monthly index of investor morale has risen to 4.2, from 1.7 in July. Sentix says: \u201cThe Brexit shock only lasted a short while. Worries about an economic slowdown have not grown further.\u201d That may be because the Bank of England moved swiftly to respond to the vote, offering hundreds of billions of pounds of liquidity to banks. Eurozone investors may also have noticed that Britain hasn\u2019t actually done very much about leaving the EU yet. Back to China\u2019s trade data....and economist Des Supple also predicts Beijing will devalue the Chinese yuan against the US dollar, to help its exporters. He fears that the global economy simply isn\u2019t growing fast enough to keep Chinese factories busy: Some breaking news for crisp fans -- Tyrrells, supplier of flavoured fried potato slices to the masses, has been sold to US popcorn maker Amplify Snack Brands in a \u00a3300m deal. Tyrrells was created by farmer William Chase, who found it was rather more profitable to turn his potatoes into crisps than sell \u2018em by the kilo. Chase cashed out back in 2008, when he sold the business to a private equity firm. He\u2019s still got his hands full of potatoes, though, turning them into expensive spirits. Mrs W assures me that the \u00a338-a-bottle Chase Gin is worth every penny..... Here\u2019s a chart of China\u2019s choppy trade stats, showing how exports and imports have been weak (in dollar terms) recently: It\u2019s been a tough few months for the world\u2019s central bankers, so we\u2019re delighted to see that Bank of England governor Mark Carney had a relaxing weekend at the Wilderness Festival in Oxfordshire: We don\u2019t know if any irate Cotswold savers tackled Carney over last week\u2019s interest rate cut - but anyone lashing out \u00a3177 for a ticket to the four-day jamboree will hopefully ride out the slowdown. Conor D\u2019Arcy, Policy Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, is also alarmed that UK companies are trying to squeeze pay rates at the bottom, while letting CEO pay surge by another 10%: \u201cOn a day when new figures show that Chief Execs are now paid 140 times as much as the average worker, it\u2019s not the best time for some businesses to focus on slowing the pay growth of those at the very bottom. \u201cBy sensibly pegging the National Living Wage to typical earnings, the government has already built in flexibility to help steer it through choppy economic times. Most employers acknowledge and support this approach, and the government should continue with a policy that will deliver a much-needed pay rise to up to six million workers. With deliciously poor timing, a group of trade bodies are lobbying the government to change its plans to raise the UK minimum wage. They are arguing that the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote means companies may not be able to pay staff at least 60 per cent of median earnings by 2020 (which would raise wages to around \u00a39.02 per hour from \u00a37.20 today). The Financial Times\u2019s Sarah O\u2019Conner has the story: Businesses are trying to persuade the government to slow or even abandon its policy to raise the \u201cnational living wage\u201d to one of the highest rates in the developed world by 2020. At least 16 trade associations have written jointly to Greg Clark, the new business secretary, recommending that he \u201cexercise caution\u201d on the national living wage in light of the \u201ceconomic uncertainties the country faces\u201d after the Brexit vote. Ideally, they would like the government to drop the 2020 target and restore the original powers of the Low Pay Commission, the committee of experts tasked with recommending minimum wage rates each year. More here: Business pushes back on national living wage There is a serious point here - there must be an \u2018optimum\u2019 level for the minimum wage that delivers the maximum benefit to workers without harming recruitment. However, businesses would be on firmer footing if they hadn\u2019t just handed their bosses a 10% pay rise. Buzzfeed\u2019s Simon Neville nails it: Ana Thaker, market economist at PhillipCapital UK, reckons Beijing will be spurred into action by July\u2019s weak trade data. The figures highlighted the weakness we have seen in the global economy and as exports slow, we could see the government and central bank engage in more easing policies to weaken the Yuan and stimulate domestic consumption and output. A weak Yuan would also have the added benefit of stifling imports and leading Chinese consumers to buy more domestically produced goods - leading to the consumption driven economy the country has been aiming for over recent years. After a lacklustre spring, Germany\u2019s factory sector bounced back in June with a 0.8% increase in production. If you strip out energy and construction, the figures are even better - with a 1.5% jump in output. France\u2019s Airbus group is missing out on today\u2019s rally. Shares in the aerospace company have dropped by 1.3% after it revealed Britain\u2019s Serious Fraud Office is conducting a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption in the commercial airline business. Europe\u2019s main stock markets are all rising in early trading: The weak Chinese trade data hasn\u2019t spooked the City, though. The FTSE 100 index has gained 29 points to 6823, its highest level since Jun 2015\u2020. Mining stocks are among the risers, with Anglo American and BHP Billiton both up around 3.5%. Traders may be expecting Beijing to launch further stimulus efforts to keep its economy on course, which would boost demand for their natural resources. China\u2019s appetite for overseas oil may also be waning. Imports of crude oil in July dropped to their lowest level since January, new figures show, signalling that energy demand has dipped: Economist are disappointed by the fall in Chinese imports and exports in July. Capital Economics\u2019 China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard fears further trouble ahead (Reuters reports). \u201cSigns of stronger manufacturing activity among many of China\u2019s key trading partners has so far failed to lift export growth. \u201cThe country\u2019s export growth is likely to remain subdued for some time.\u201d IG analyst Angus Nicholson believes China\u2019s trading partners will be concerned that its trade surplus swelled to $52.3bn last month (via the WSJ) \u201cI definitely think we could see concern over the surplus...We have a long way to go before we really see a decline in China\u2019s overcapacity.\u201d Clara Leonard of RBC Capital Markets says the trade figures are a bad start to a busy week of Chinese data: In China this morning, July trade data was a disappointment, highlighting that world trade growth remain weak.... In China, there will be several other important economic releases this week, including July inflation (Tuesday), industrial production (Friday), retail sales (Friday) and finally new loans and M2. The week is beginning with worrying news from China. Chinese exports shrank by 4.4% year-on-year in July in dollar terms, following a 4.8% decline in June, according to fresh figures from the country\u2019s customs department. It may indicate that Britain\u2019s Brexit vote has hit global confidence, or that the world economy is weakening for other reasons. Chinese imports were even worse, shrinking by 12.5% year-on-year, the biggest decline since February. That suggests China\u2019s domestic demand is faltering despite Beijing\u2019s efforts to stimulate its economy. The figures are slightly better in local currency terms, due to the recent depreciation of the yuan. But it\u2019s not what the markets were looking for, and renews concerns over China\u2019s ability to rebalance its economy and tackle the bad debts lurking in the banking sector. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK, says the trade figures could spark more concern about China: Investors have not paid much consideration to Chinese numbers for some time now, as their attention was very much focused on Brexit and the Fed interest rate. However, the number released over in China has made investors wary once again that the situation both at home and abroad is not improving. I\u2019ll pull together more reaction shortly.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britons are waking up to the news that the bosses of their largest companies have enjoyed another bumper pay rise. The average CEO (and some of them are more average than others) took home \u00a35.5m last year in pay and other incentives, according to the High Pay Centre. That\u2019s 10% more than a year ago. Advertising magnate Sir Martin Sorrell needed a particularly large wheelbarrow, as he picked up \u00a370m thanks to a long-term incentive plan. The report piles more pressure on the City to reform its pay policies, after a summer of shareholder anger against boss pay. My colleague Juliette Garside explains: \u201cThere is apparently no end yet in sight for the rise and rise of chief executive pay packages,\u201d said the centre\u2019s director, Stefan Stern. \u201cIn spite of the occasional flurry from more active shareholders, boards continue to award ever larger amounts of pay to their most senior executives.\u201d Leading company bosses now typically earn 129 times more \u2013 including pensions and bonuses \u2013 than their employees. The prime minister has promised to rein in soaraway salaries. In a shot across the City\u2019s bows, Theresa May last month set out a series of boardroom reforms, including giving employee representatives a seat at the top table. She condemned the \u201cirrational, unhealthy and growing gap between what these companies pay their workers and what they pay their bosses\u201d. The report should get plenty of attention today, especially as we\u2019re into the August lull. There\u2019s really not much on the agenda today, apart from Chinese trade data (more on that shortly) German industrial production figures for June Eurozone Sentix confidence survey, at 9.30am BST And the European stock markets are likely to be subdued:",

Investcorp, a Bahrain-based investor in luxury brands, has sold Tyrrells to Amplify Snacks, the US owner of SkinnyPop popcorn. Amplify plans to increase US sales of Tyrrells products, which include parsnip crisps and sour cream flavoured tortillas with poppy seeds. The deal is the third sale of Tyrrells since it was founded as a sideline business 14 years ago by William Chase, who was then a struggling Herefordshire potato farmer. Chase sold the business to private equity firm Langholm Capital in 2008 for around \u00a340m. Langholm sold Tyrrells to Investcorp in 2013 for \u00a3100m. Under Investcorp\u2019s ownership, sales have more than doubled, while non-UK sales have increased from 20% of the total to almost 40%. It has also added organic and gluten-free snacks to the product range. David Milner, Tyrrells\u2019 chief executive, will stay on as international president at Amplify, which specialises in healthier snacks. He joined Tyrrells in 2010. Milner said: \u201cAs a small, UK farm-based business it is a tremendous achievement to be now part of a US publicly traded company with the international reach to make Tyrrells a global brand.\u201d Tyrrells said it was still based at the Herefordshire farm in England where Chase launched the business in 2002. Chase became disillusioned with Langholm after it ditched the small retailers he had cultivated and started selling to Tesco. Chase, who has branched out into making premium vodka, also complained that Langholm stopped using his premium potatoes for cheaper ones. Amplify\u2019s chief executive, Tom Ennis, said: \u201cThe product characteristics and flavour profiles of Tyrrells\u2019 on-trend premium brands align with Amplify\u2019s better-for-you snacking strategy.

The Lloyds Trade Union, which has 30,000 members, has begun action against the bailed-out bank over an issue it estimates could cost major UK companies \u00a320bn. The action relates to guaranteed minimum pensions (GMPs), whereby companies provided an equivalent pension to those wanting to top up their retirement savings. \u201cIt\u2019s been accepted by almost everyone that GMPs are by their nature discriminatory between men and women,\u201d the LTU said. This is because men and women accrue benefits at different rates and are entitled to their pensions at different ages, 65 for men and 60 for women. The government published a consultation on the matter in 2012 but has not legislated on how the situation should be resolved for an estimated 5 million women who have contracted out of pension schemes. Mark Brown, general secretary at LTU, is now seeking action. He said: \u201cGMPs is one of the last bastions of pensions discrimination and the issue needs to be resolved now. Up to 5 million women, including up to 148,000 in Lloyds Banking Group, have either got or are going to get smaller pension increases than men and that is simply unacceptable.\u201d The LTU\u2019s legal advisers have launched a legal action on behalf of three women which could lead to a class action on behalf of 28,000 female members of the defined benefit pension schemes. The case could rise to 148,000 individuals, based on estimates of active scheme members, those who have deferred entitlements and existing pensioners. Lloyds\u2019 schemes have about 275,000 active, deferred and pensioner members. Lloyds declined to comment. The LTU was \u201cderecognised\u201d by the bank last year.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green should get his cheque book out now to support BHS staff whose pensions are threatened by the company\u2019s collapse, the chairman of a parliamentary committee has said. Iain Wright, who chairs the business, innovations and skills committee, said he was frustrated by the lack of progress in resolving the pension deficit at BHS since Green told MPs in mid-June that he would \u201csort it\u201d. Wright said MPs were determined to put pressure on Green to deal with the deficit, which could be more than \u00a3700m, although he admitted they had few formal powers to make him do so. Green\u2019s knighthood is under review and his reputation has taken a battering after MPs pressured him to appear before the parliamentary committee. Wright told the BBC\u2019s Today programme: \u201cPhilip Green came before our committee and said he would sort out the pension scheme, but there has been very little progress since then. If he wanted to sort this \u2026 he would be getting his cheque book out and sorting it now.\u201d Green, who sold BHS for \u00a31 to the formerly bankrupt Dominic Chappell about a year before the retailer went into administration, may be still liable for bailing out the pension deficit because regulators have powers to pursue former owners. He and his wife, Tina, have combined wealth of $5.6bn (\u00a34.3bn), according to Forbes. The pension scheme was in surplus when Green bought BHS in 2000. Green and other shareholders since took out more than \u00a3400m in dividends from the business. The deficit may now stand at more than \u00a3700m after the Bank of England\u2019s post-Brexit measures reduced yields on government bonds, in which pension schemes invest. However, Green\u2019s starting point is likely to be the \u00a3350m it would cost the Pension Protection Fund to partly compensate members of the scheme. Wright said that instead of reassuring members of the BHS pension scheme, Green\u2019s advisers are involved in a standoff with the pensions regulator. He admitted that the regulator acts slowly but that the scheme\u2019s deficit was Green\u2019s fault because he let it build up when he owned BHS. \u201cThe pensions regulator is in early discussions with Sir Philip\u2019s people. They are circling around each other like punch-drunk fighters around the ring without landing a decisive blow,\u201d Wright said. \u201cPhilip Green needs to do the right thing. The responsibility for BHS, including the enormous pension scheme deficit, lies with Philip Green. It\u2019s up to him. He has got the responsibility to sort it out.\u201d Green\u2019s PR advisers could not immediately be reached to comment.",

They are circling around each other like punch-drunk fighters around the ring without landing a decisive blow,\u201d Wright said. </p> <p>\u201cPhilip Green needs to do the right thing. The responsibility for BHS, including the enormous pension scheme deficit, lies with Philip Green. It\u2019s up to him.

      "bodyText": "The bosses of Britain\u2019s largest public companies earned an average of \u00a35.5m last year, and have enjoyed a 10% pay rise while wages in the rest of the economy lag far behind. Rapid inflation for the country\u2019s best paid executives is being driven by a small, all-male group at the top of the corporate tree, according to the High Pay Centre, which published its annual survey on earnings at FTSE 100 companies on Monday. \u201cThere is apparently no end yet in sight for the rise and rise of chief executive pay packages,\u201d said the centre\u2019s director, Stefan Stern. \u201cIn spite of the occasional flurry from more active shareholders, boards continue to award ever larger amounts of pay to their most senior executives.\u201d Leading company bosses now typically earn 129 times more \u2013 including pensions and bonuses \u2013 than their employees. The prime minister has promised to rein in soaraway salaries. In a shot across the City\u2019s bows, Theresa May last month set out a series of boardroom reforms, including giving employee representatives a seat at the top table. She condemned the \u201cirrational, unhealthy and growing gap between what these companies pay their workers and what they pay their bosses\u201d. For the average worker, wages rose by 2% in 2015, according to the Office for National Statistics. The modest increase followed sharp falls in the wake of the financial crisis. In the meantime, top bosses\u2019 pay has soared from \u00a34.1m in 2010 to just under \u00a35m in 2014, to \u00a35.48m last year. The advertising boss Sir Martin Sorrell topped the high earners league for the second year running, receiving a record \u00a370m in 2015, one of the biggest annual windfalls in UK corporate history. The executive who built WPP from a manufacturer of wire baskets into the world\u2019s largest advertising group saw his pay jump from an already controversial \u00a343m in 2014. Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of house builder Berkeley Group, came second with \u00a323m. His pay rocketed thanks to share options granted in 2009, when the financial crisis had triggered a collapse in Berkeley\u2019s stock market value. Sorrell is one of six bosses who have appeared in the top 10 two years running. The others include Rakesh Kapoor at pharmaceuticals group Reckitt Benckiser, who took home \u00a323m; Bob Dudley, who collected \u00a313m for running the oil group BP; and the banker Ant\u00f3nio Horta Os\u00f3rio, who was paid \u00a38.8m at Lloyds Group, which is partly owned by the taxpayer. \u201cBig pay is a boys\u2019 club,\u201d the report claims. No women made it into the ranks of the 10 highest earning executives in either of the last two years. The Sky television boss, Jeremy Darroch, with \u00a317m, and Flemming \u00d8rnskov, the Danish chief executive of pharmaceuticals group Shire, are among the new entrants. Boardroom reform was a central plank of Theresa May\u2019s successful campaign to become leader of the Conservative party. She promised to make shareholder votes on pay not just advisory but binding; called for all listed companies to publish the ratio between chief executive and average worker pay; and said that under her prime ministership, employees would have a seat in the boardroom alongside company directors. \u201cThe High Pay Centre was delighted by Theresa May\u2019s recent intervention on this issue,\u201d said Stern. \u201cThere now seems to be political will and momentum behind attempts to reform top pay.\u201d Under new rules introduced by the former business secretary Vince Cable in 2013, the annual vote on the pay report \u2013 which approves how much executives actually earn \u2013 is non-binding. Shareholders can make binding votes only on a company\u2019s executive pay policy, which sets out a three-year plan. But investors have complained of being asked to approve schemes without knowing enough about them. The three-year plans contain predictions for the maximum executives could earn, but these have not always proved reliable. Rewards at Berkeley, Sky, Shire and Sports Direct have all overshot predictions by some margins. In April, BP shareholders were furious when the board decided to hike Dudley\u2019s pay by nearly 20%, in a year when the company had run up a $6.5bn loss. Investors staged a rebellion, with 59% of votes cast against the board. However, under the current system, the vote was non-binding. May\u2019s proposals, if they are made, represent a culture shift. Currently, no FTSE 100 company publishes its chief executive to employee pay ratio and just one, according to the High Pay Centre, has employee representatives on the board. Travel group Tui, which merged with Germany\u2019s Tui AG in December 2014, has an airline pilot and a travel agent sitting alongside its directors. In Germany, worker representation at companies over a certain size is a right. Up to half the seats on supervisory boards of companies with more than 2,000 staff can be held by employees.
