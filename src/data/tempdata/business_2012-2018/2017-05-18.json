      "bodyText": "Cineworld has agreed to meet union representatives to try to resolve a long-running dispute over pay and conditions at its Picturehouse chain. Staff at the Ritzy in Brixton and five other Picturehouse cinemas have gone on strike in recent months, disrupting the London film festival in October, in their battle to secure the independently calculated living wage and better sick pay for workers. More strikes are planned, including one at the East Dulwich Picturehouse on 27 May. At the company\u2019s annual meeting on Thursday in a recently refurbished Cineworld cinema in Wandsworth, south London, three Picturehouse staff asked the company chair, Tony Bloom, to start paying workers the living wage. Bloom said the company \u2013 one of the biggest cinema operators in Europe with 226 cinemas, half of which are in the UK \u2013 would be happy to meet with representatives of the Bectu union as long as both sides acted in \u201cgood faith\u201d. Natalie Parsons, a shareholder who works for the Ritzy, said: \u201cEvery time the Ritzy is closed on a Saturday, the company loses \u00a320,000, and five other cinemas are now participating in industrial action. Would it not make financial sense to meet with staff as soon as possible to reach a resolution on this dispute?\u201d Edward Bauer, who works at the Hackney Picturehouse, which has also staged strikes, added: \u201cI\u2019m paid \u00a39.05 per hour for nine hours. I can\u2019t live on popcorn and free cinema tickets. It\u2019s a struggle. We genuinely believe that staff in London and elsewhere deserve the security of having wages pegged to the cost of living.\u201d Bloom said the board was \u201cproud of our employment practices everywhere\u201d and defended the Picturehouse pay rates, claiming they were the highest in the industry, at \u00a39.05 an hour in London (Ritzy staff are paid \u00a39.10 an hour) and \u00a38.18 outside the capital. Including paid half-hour breaks, this amounted to \u00a39.65 \u2013 \u201cwithin inches\u201d of the London living wage, Bloom said \u2013 and to \u00a38.72 outside London. The living wage calculated by the Living Wage Foundation stands at \u00a39.75 an hour in London, and \u00a38.45 outside the capital. Bloom expressed concern about the company becoming a living wage accredited organisation, like its rival Curzon. \u201cIf we agree to the living wage and it rises to \u00a315 next year we\u2019ll be bound to follow that,\u201d he said. Last autumn the Curzon chain agreed to pay all staff, including agency workers, the living wage. However, Cineworld\u2019s other main rival, Odeon, pays the minimum wage of \u00a37.50 an hour. A spokesperson for Cineworld said all its staff were paid above the statutory rates but did not disclose the rates for Cineworld workers. Until now the company has negotiated pay deals with its staff forum, which it says represents the majority of Picturehouse staff, and refused to meet with Bectu. But some staff have rejected the forum, saying it was set up and funded by Picturehouse. Bectu initially only represented 50 workers at the Ritzy but the number has grown to more than 300 members at other cinemas, who have been involved in strikes. Other issues brought up by workers include zero-hours contracts, sick pay and maternity pay. Ben Lennon, who works for the East Dulwich Picturehouse, told the AGM: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to pay rent in London on a zero-hours contract. I pay rent and I don\u2019t have much left after that.\u201d About 70% of Cineworld\u2019s front-of-house staff in the UK \u2013 3,750 including 700 at Picturehouse \u2013 are on zero-hours contracts. The company said staff could choose whether they want to be on a zero-hours contract and that it suited certain people such as students. The shareholder group ShareAction said it was supporting staff in their battle for better pay. The campaign has also received backing from Sir Ian McKellen, Ken Loach and others in the film industry. A trading update published before the AGM showed Cineworld enjoyed revenue growth of 21.3% for the period from 1 January to 11 May, with cinemagoers flocking to their screens to see Beauty and the Beast, La La Land and The Lego Batman Movie.",

Mark Newton-Jones, Mothercare chief executive, said it would look to close up to 70 of its 152 UK stores as it adapts to a digital age where 41% of sales are rung up online. \u201cWe are taking a fresh look at our estate and asking how many do we really need?\u201d said Newton-Jones. \u201cWe\u2019ve got six stores in Bristol \u2013 we don\u2019t need six stores in Bristol. In Sheffield we\u2019ve got five within a 20-minute drive time when we only need one or two. To cover all the major conurbations you only need 80 to 100 stores.\u201d At the start of this decade Mothercare was a ubiquitous presence on British high streets with closer to 400 stores but successive management teams have whittled away at that figure as the retailer struggled to compete with incursions by the supermarkets and online giant Amazon into what was once a specialist market. Newton-Jones was hired in 2014 to lead a turnaround of Mothercare, but confidence was knocked by poor trading last summer. Since taking the helm he has closed 100 loss-making UK outlets and modernised 70% of the remaining stores.

Pruning the UK chain, which has racked up losses of close to \u00a3100m over the last six years, has put it on the road to recovery with analysts predicting it will move into profit next year. In recent years Mothercare has been forced to fall back on the success of its large overseas business but that is now facing headwinds of its own as shoppers in the Middle East \u2013 its biggest regional market outside the UK \u2013 spend less because of the slump in the oil price. Pre-tax profits at Mothercare were flat at \u00a319.7m on sales of \u00a3667.4m in the year to 25 March. Within that UK losses narrowed to \u00a34.4m from \u00a36.4m a year ago while underlying profits at its international business declined 13% to \u00a335.2m. UK like-for-like sales were up 1.1%. The shares closed down more than 3% at 124p. GlobalData analyst Sofie Willmott described the figures as \u201clacklustre\u201d with the inclusion of online sales masking some poor store performances in the UK: \u201cGiven that Mothercare\u2019s turnaround plan is in part focussed on investment in store refits we expected to be seeing more significant gains in UK store sales by now.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain went on a spending spree in April. The shops were full of punters. Online retailers coined it in. Spring brought with it an end to the winter consumer spending blues. That at least is what the official figures suggest. The Office for National Statistics reported that the volume of retail sales rose by 2.3% last month, smashing City expectations. It was enough, in combination with Donald Trump\u2019s political woes in Washington, to send the pound back through the $1.30 level to its highest since last September. But hang on a minute. This is the same Office for National Statistics that said earlier this week that living standards were being squeezed because wages were failing to keep pace with prices. Something doesn\u2019t quite add up. One explanation is that the ONS has got its seasonal adjustment wrong. The late timing of Easter this year would be expected to lead to a rise in spending between March and April and the ONS tries to make an allowance for this. But it is not an exact science, which is why the monthly movements in retail sales often look quite dramatic. April\u2019s big rise followed a 1.4% fall between February and March. The weather also has an impact, particularly for certain sectors of retailing. April was a relatively warm month, which tends to increase footfall in the high street. Garden centres seem to have done especially well. A less benign explanation is that consumers are either ignoring the squeeze on their real incomes or are oblivious to it. If so, expect to see an increase in consumer debt over the coming months. This, though, does not square with what happened in the first few months of 2017, when consumers did seem to be tightening their belts after spending freely in the second half of 2016. Despite record levels of employment and ultra-low interest rates, there was a marked slowdown in retail activity. All of which suggests that the April increase in retail sales should be treated with some caution. The ONS always suggests that looking at retail sales over the latest three months is a better guide to what\u2019s happening than a single month\u2019s data, and that advice is particularly apposite here. Between the three months ending in January and the three months ending in April, retail sales volumes rose by 0.3%. That looks about right and fits with the general picture of an economy that is not about to plunge into recession but is not exactly firing on all cylinders either. Conservative consumers The Conservative manifesto has much to say about consumer protection. Action is pledged to help motorists, rail passengers, leaseholders and phone users. Despite the derision heaped on Ed Miliband when he proposed the self-same policy two years ago, there will be a price cap on energy bills, which ministers estimate would be worth \u00a31.7bn a year to households. There is, though, one big omission from the list: help for people buying their own homes on standard variable rate (SVR) mortgages, who could save themselves money by moving to a cheaper home loan deal. This is curious for three reasons. Firstly, the savings are considerably higher than for the energy cap. Banking analysts at Bernstein note that it is possible to get a two-year fixed rate mortgage at 1.4% while the 35% of mortgage payers on SVRs are paying 4.2% (on average). If they remortgaged at the market interest rate of between 2.2% and 2.6% they would save themselves between \u00a35bn and \u00a37bn a year. Lloyds, by virtue of owning the Halifax, would stand to be the biggest losers. Secondly, savings of this size would ease the pressure on living standards and help the economy through its current sticky patch. The evidence suggests that those on SVRs tend to be lower-income households in the poorer regions of Britain. They would spend any windfall they received from a lower mortgage rate. Finally, there is a simple mechanism by which the government could effect change. Competition in the mortgage industry means that people are coming off SVRs albeit at a slow rate. But lenders that are charging what are effectively rip-off mortgage rates have received more than \u00a3100bn in cut-price funding from the Bank of England in recent years. That provides the government with considerable leverage. It should not hesitate to use it. Putting your money where the man is Returning to Lloyds, the government\u2019s disposal of its stake in the bank - which once stood at 43% \u2013 has prompted speculation that its boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio will now consider it job done and head for the exit. The Portuguese banker seems to be trying to quash such talk: he spent \u00a336,000 on shares on Wednesday, not usually the actions of an executive about to walk.",

The late timing of Easter this year would be expected to lead to a rise in spending between March and April and the ONS tries to make an allowance for this. But it is not an exact science, which is why the monthly movements in retail sales often look quite dramatic. April\u2019s big rise followed a 1.4% fall between February and March.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/18/uk-retail-sales-best-forecasts-despite-pay-squeeze\">UK retail sales surge despite pay squeeze</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The weather also has an impact, particularly for certain sectors of retailing. April was a relatively warm month, which tends to increase footfall in the high street. Garden centres seem to have done especially well.</p> <p>A less benign explanation is that consumers are either ignoring the squeeze on their real incomes or are oblivious to it. If so, expect to see an increase in consumer debt over the coming months.</p> <p>This, though, does not square with what happened in the first few months of 2017, when consumers did seem to be tightening their belts after spending freely in the second half of 2016. Despite record levels of employment and ultra-low interest rates, there was a marked slowdown in retail activity.</p> <p>All of which suggests that the April increase in retail sales should be treated with some caution. The ONS always suggests that looking at retail sales over the latest three months is a better guide to what\u2019s happening than a single month\u2019s data, and that advice is particularly apposite here.</p> <p>Between the three months ending in January and the three months ending in April, retail sales volumes rose by 0.3%. That looks about right and fits with the general picture of an economy that is not about to plunge into recession but is not exactly firing on all cylinders either.</p> <h2>Conservative consumers</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/18/theresa-may-launches-conservative-manifesto-for-community-and-country\">The Conservative manifesto </a>has much to say about consumer protection. Action is pledged to help motorists, rail passengers, leaseholders and phone users. Despite the derision heaped on Ed Miliband when he proposed the self-same policy two years ago, there will be a price cap on energy bills, which ministers estimate would be worth \u00a31.7bn a year to households.<br></p> <p>There is, though, one big omission from the list: help for people buying their own homes on standard variable rate (SVR) mortgages, who could save themselves money by moving to a cheaper home loan deal.</p> <p>This is curious for three reasons. Firstly, the savings are considerably higher than for the energy cap. Banking analysts at Bernstein note that it is possible to get a two-year fixed rate mortgage at 1.4% while the 35% of mortgage payers on SVRs are paying 4.2% (on average). If they remortgaged at the market interest rate of between 2.2% and 2.6% they would save themselves between \u00a35bn and \u00a37bn a year. Lloyds, by virtue of owning the Halifax, would stand to be the biggest losers.</p> <p>Secondly, savings of this size would ease the pressure on living standards and help the economy through its current sticky patch. The evidence suggests that those on SVRs tend to be lower-income households in the poorer regions of Britain. They would spend any windfall they received from a lower mortgage rate.</p> <p>Finally, there is a simple mechanism by which the government could effect change. Competition in the mortgage industry means that people are coming off SVRs albeit at a slow rate. But lenders that are charging what are effectively rip-off mortgage rates have received more than \u00a3100bn in cut-price funding from the Bank of England in recent years. That provides the government with considerable leverage. It should not hesitate to use it.</p> <h2>Putting your money where the man is</h2> <p>Returning to Lloyds, the government\u2019s disposal of its stake in the bank - which once stood at 43% \u2013 has prompted speculation that its boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio will now consider it job done and head for the exit. The Portuguese banker seems to be trying to quash such talk: he spent \u00a336,000 on shares on Wednesday, not usually the actions of an executive about to walk.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A surprise surge in retail sales in April helped push the pound to its highest level in eight months as Britain\u2019s consumers shrugged off concerns over falling living standards. Warm weather and the Easter holidays encouraged shoppers back onto UK high streets, with retail sales up 2.3% over the month according to the Office for National Statistics. It was more than double the 1% rise forecast by economists, and the biggest monthly rise since January 2016. April\u2019s rise was a significant rebound compared with March, when sales fell 1.4%, easing fears of an imminent consumer slowdown and signalling a decent start to the third quarter. The stronger-than-expected figures were at odds with broader expectations of a slowdown in consumer spending this year, as prices begin to outpace wage growth, putting increasing pressure on household budgets. Falling real pay is already a reality for UK workers, with average earnings rising by 2.1% year on year in the three months to March \u2013 slower than the 2.3% rate of inflation in the same period. \u201cThe latest data showed shoppers continued to shrug off any Brexit and political uncertainty with retail sales beating even the most optimistic expectations,\u201d said Richard Lim, chief executive of the consultancy Retail Economics. \u201cDespite the surge in inflation and squeeze on households\u2019 finances, consumers were out in force during the Easter break with the warm weather driving sales across the sector.\u201d The UK has relied heavily on consumers to drive growth since the financial crisis, with other sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing and construction taking a bigger hit. However, with inflation expected to pick up to about 3% and pay growth expected to remain weak, household budgets are likely to come under increasing pressure. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said that despite the strong retail figures in April, he expected the consumer slowdown to materialise in the coming months, which in turn would weigh on the wider economy. \u201cWith inflation likely to continue accelerating sharply, the headwinds facing the consumer will intensify, which in turn is likely to slow the pace of consumer spending later in the year. We therefore remain of the view that the pace of GDP growth has further downside into the end of the year.\u201d The rise in April was fairly broad based, with sales in non-food stores up by 2.3% and sales at supermarkets and other food stores up by 1.3%. However, department store sales were down by 0.9%. The April jump helped retail sales over a broader three-month period grow by 0.3%. This followed a brief period of contraction. The annual rate of growth doubled to 4% from 2% in March. The stronger-than-expected figures pushed the pound as high as $1.3045 at one point on Thursday \u2013 its highest against the dollar since 29 September last year \u2013 partly as traders brought forward their expectations for an interest rate rise from the Bank of England. The pound has fallen sharply since the Brexit vote last June, and at $1.30 it is still 13% lower against the dollar than it was on the day of the referendum. Sterling\u2019s strength on Thursday was also a story of dollar weakness, as US investors grew increasingly nervous about the controversy surrounding President Trump and his firing of FBI director James Comey. Investor jitters spread to European stock markets, with most major indices closing down. In the UK, the FTSE 100 closed down 0.9% at 7,436, while Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC were down 0.3% and 0.5% respectively. In the US, markets were slightly higher after suffering their biggest one-day fall since September on Wednesday. \u201cEuropean equities are now fully entangled in the Trump-related sell-off. On Wednesday the US market bore the brunt of the move but now it has gone global,\u201d said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK. \u201cThe gains that were made at the beginning of the month are quickly evaporating, and dealers are looking to dump their stocks. Trump has been close to controversy for some time now, but a story like this will hang around, and that is precisely the reason why traders want to exit the market.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As forecast, the continuing controversy over Donald Trump and his actions relating to Russia and the sacking of FBI director James Comey, sent Wall Street lower again as markets opened. But after their worst day since September, the falls have been fairly limited and could easily be reversed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 14 points, while the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.15% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.22% in early trade. Meanwhile European markets remain under pressure, with the FTSE 100 down 1.2%, Germany\u2019s Dax dropping 0.65% and France\u2019s Cac 0.89% lower. Dennis de Jong, managing director UFT.com, said: While the impeachment of Donald Trump may not be a serious possibility at this stage, the mere mention of the word has seen warning lights go off across the world, with doubts over the President\u2019s ability to deliver on his planned infrastructure spending and tax reforms. Investors are steering clear of any risky assets due to the uncertainty over Trump\u2019s future \u2013 and given the unpredictable nature of the presidency so far, this is unlikely to improve any time soon. With potentially more revelations on Trump yet to surface, global financial uncertainty could be a feature of the next four years \u2013 if he lasts that long, that is. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. And nor is Brazil: Ahead of the Wall Street open, and European markets are not looking too healthy: More fallout from the uncertainty surrounding President Trump and his future plans. Copper has fallen 1.8% on concerns that his promised infrastructure spending could be derailed by the current controversy surrounding the president. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Asa Bridle told Reuters: Anything that is industrially oriented has taken a bit of a whack because there are doubts about whether Trump can push through his massive infrastructure spending plans. Back to the US, and despite the current political shenanigans the day\u2019s economic data is better than expected. US jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week, down by 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 232,000. Analysts had forecast a rise to 240,000. The number of Americans receiving unemployment benefit is now at a 28 and a half year low. Meanwhile the Philadelphia business conditions survey for May jumped from 22 in the previous month to 38.8, much higher than the forecast level of 19.5. The US is not the only country which could be heading for political problems: Here is the background: At the ECB meeting, according to the minutes, ECB board member and chief economist Peter Praet warned colleagues to be careful when talking about the future of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy: Mr Praet considered that, at the current juncture, the Governing Council had to be particularly cautious regarding the future evolution of its policy communication. After a prolonged period of exceptional monetary policy accommodation, financial market participants were particularly sensitive to any perceived change in the future course of monetary policy. Any substantial change in communication needed to be motivated by some more evidence that the present indications of acceleration in activity found confirmation in hard data and fed through to a sustainable adjustment in inflation. Looking ahead to the Governing Council\u2019s 7-8 June monetary policy meeting, a new round of Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections and a new assessment of the risks to the outlook would become available to inform discussions on the way forward. At last month\u2019s regular meeting the European Central Bank kept its interest rate policy and bond buying programme unchanged, with the eurozone economy improving but the inflation outlook subdued. In the minutes of the meeting just released, the ECB expands on this: While there was broad agreement that the configuration of risks to euro area activity had improved overall, some members considered that the risks to real GDP could now be characterised as broadly balanced, in particular given the improvement in recent data and indicators and the decline in political uncertainty. Other members maintained that downside risks to growth still prevailed and that a change in the risk assessment was premature in view of continued risks and uncertainties, even if diminishing, both globally and in the euro area. There is more detail on the outlook and the risks involved: Members exchanged views on the outlook and risks for the external environment, also taking into account the latest IMF World Economic Outlook, which had been released after the Governing Council meeting in early March, and the related discussions at the IMF spring meetings. It was underlined that the latest data on global activity and trade pointed to stronger global growth momentum and a re-synchronisation of the recovery, between global growth and trade and between advanced and emerging economies. However, the external outlook was considered to be still subject to elevated uncertainty, and the balance of risks to the outlook for global growth was assessed to remain on the downside. Among the factors that continued to contribute to this uncertainty were the scope and timing of the future policy choices of the new US Administration, the economic impact of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, the rebalancing of demand and the transition towards lower growth rates in China, and developments in other emerging market economies. In particular, reference was made in the discussion to the high degree of uncertainty surrounding short-term developments in the US economy, which reflected a significant divergence between hard and soft data for the United States. Moreover, financial market participants and investors were reassessing the outlook for US growth and inflation, as it appeared that US data were no longer exceeding market expectations, and there was still considerable uncertainty surrounding the new US Administration\u2019s policies, including the prospects for fiscal stimulus, and their likely expansionary effects. April\u2019s UK retail sales figures should be treated with a little caution, says economics editor Larry Elliott: Britain went on a spending spree in April. The shops were full of punters. Online retailers coined it in. Spring brought with it an end to the winter consumer spending blues. That at least is what the official figures suggest. The Office for National Statistics reported that the volume of retail sales rose by 2.3% last month, smashing City expectations. This, though, is the same Office for National Statistics that said earlier this week that living standards were being squeezed because wages were failing to keep pace with prices. Something doesn\u2019t quite add up. His full analysis is here: Future market moves will be balanced between the growing Trump risk and the reasonable economic and corporate data coming out, suggests Nick Brooks,head of economic and investment research at asset manager Intermediate Capital Group: Scepticism about Trump\u2019s ability to follow through on his campaign promises has been growing over time as reflected in the flattening of the US yield curve and weakening of the US dollar since the beginning of the year. Up until the Comey firing, however, most investors in risk assets largely ignored the political noise, preferring to focus on improving economic and earnings data. The most recent events are being taken far more seriously by investors, with recent market movements indicating investors are looking at the latest scandal as potentially representing a death knell for Trump\u2019s fiscal agenda. Those investors that have not already capitulated on so-called Trump trades will likely be liquidating those positions sharply. A prolonged wider risk asset sell-off seems unlikely, however, as long as the macro and earnings data continues to hold up. The recovery in the US futures market seems to have gone into reverse: Here\u2019s our full story on the UK retail sales, from my colleague Angela Monaghan: Most first quarter GDP figures have now been released, and Germany is leading the way again as it did last year: The pound is holding on to its gains, up 0.45% against the dollar at $1.3027 and 0.8% better against the euro at $1.1712. At its peak so far during the morning, the pound reached $1.3045, which is its highest against the dollar since 29 September last year. But it is still way below the $1.4878 level the day before the Brexit result was announced. The strength of sterling is conversely hitting the FTSE 100 due to its preponderance of overseas earnings, with the leading index now down 100 points or 1.34%. Online sales continue to gain ground, points out Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte: Online sales have been particularly strong over the last few months and April is no different; online retail is up 19% from last year and now accounts for 15.6% of all retail spending. Indeed, UK consumers spent \u00a31bn a week online in April. He also suggests - with some reservations - that May might also be a good month for the high street: Looking ahead, May\u2019s retail sales figures could benefit from mild, sunny weather coinciding with the two bank holiday weekends, which should be the perfect recipe for further increased footfall. However, May 2016 was a particularly strong month, so it will be interesting to see how the year-on-year comparisons fare, and whether the figures for May 2017 show the first signs of inflation starting to bite. More reaction to the forecast-busting UK retail sales figures, and there are warnings that consumer optimism may not last with the continuing squeeze on real earnings: Ben Brettell, senior economist, Hargreaves Lansdown: Given yesterday\u2019s news that real wages are now falling, today\u2019s retail sales data was always going to be closely scrutinised. The theory went that squeezed household budgets would likely hit retailers in the pocket too. But in fact the figures beat expectations handsomely, with sales in April 2.3% higher than in March and growing 4.0% year-on-year. April\u2019s figures were always expected to be better than March, because of the timing of the Easter holiday, but economists had forecast a smaller rebound of 1.0%, and much more subdued annual growth of 2.0%. The ONS says April\u2019s warm weather encouraged people to spend on food, home improvements and gardening equipment. The balance of probability suggests that at some point the combination of higher inflation and lacklustre wage growth will take its toll on the UK consumer. But today\u2019s numbers provide some welcome evidence the economy has made a brighter start to the second quarter following disappointing GDP growth of 0.3% in Q1. With the labour market looking relatively robust, it\u2019s possible the current mood of pessimism is unjustified. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit: April\u2019s sharp rebound in retail sales gives a boost to second quarter GDP growth prospects. It buoys hopes that consumer spending will not hamper UK GDP growth as it clearly did in the first quarter. It is evident that the more than halving of UK GDP growth to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2017 (from 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016) was primarily the consequence of previously buoyant consumers reining in their spending as purchasing power was hit hard by inflation and low earnings growth combined. However, April\u2019s jump in retail sales looks unlikely to mark the beginning of a renewed upturn in consumer spending given the sharp and increasing squeeze on purchasing power. April\u2019s decent rebound in retail sales was clearly helped substantially by warm weather lifted sales of outdoor products. There is also the possibility that the later Easter had some beneficial impact although the ONS indicated that the data are seasonally-adjusted to allow for this. The suspicion is that it needs something special like markedly warmer weather to currently get consumers to really loosen their purse strings, given the marked dilution of their purchasing power in recent months. Worryingly for UK growth prospects, the squeeze on consumers looks highly likely tighten further over the coming months as rising inflation eats further into purchasing power with the pressure reinforced by ongoing muted earnings growth... There is also a strong likelihood that consumer confidence and willingness to buy major items will soften \u2013 as it is not only pressurised by weakened purchasing power but also by increasing concerns over the economy and perhaps job security... It is also questionable as to whether the labour market can continue to hold up given the growth slowdown and uncertain outlook (including likely difficult Brexit negotiations with the EU coming increasingly coming to the forefront after the 8 June general election is done and dusted. James Smith, economist at ING Bank: A big rebound in retail sales is likely to prove temporary, as the ongoing squeeze on household incomes starts to weigh more heavily on consumer activity over coming months. Today\u2019s retail sales data was clearly boosted by warmer weather and a late Easter, which helps retailers sell their summer wares (particularly clothing and household/garden items) in higher volumes, but also at more profitable prices. A rainy, cold early Easter makes the lives of retailers much trickier in this respect. Whilst that is likely to account for much of April\u2019s 2% MoM gain in retail sales (ex. auto fuel), we have to remember that these figures are extremely volatile. It\u2019s very likely that there are seasonal adjustment issues, as statisticians struggle to keep pace with ever-changing consumer habits \u2013 the rise of Black Friday style sales is a good example. To us, today\u2019s data doesn\u2019t change the underlying story, where the squeeze in household incomes is starting to weigh on consumer activity. This week\u2019s surge in inflation (2.7%) and subdued wage growth (2.1%) means real incomes are now falling. It\u2019s also worth noting that much of the strength in consumption over the past few months has been driven in no-small-part by higher borrowing and lower savings, which is unlikely to prove sustainable. For that reason, we don\u2019t expect the Bank of England to hike rates before 2019. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the retail sectors: Sterling could move even higher, according to David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trader XTB: The pound is trading higher across the board this morning and the recovery seen in the currency since hitting a multi-decade low in January has been impressive and looks set to continue. The retail sales figure itself was the best since the start of 2016 and will go some way to allay the fears of a slowdown in consumer spending following last month\u2019s sharp drop in this widely viewed indicator. The release marks a 3rd consecutive day of GBP positive economic data, after both the CPI and unemployment figures surpassed estimates. With short positioning still at elevated levels in the pound there could be more legs to this rally, with little by the way of technical resistance seen until \u00a21.32. Analysts had been expecting a recovery in retail sales after the slide in March, partly because of the timing of Easter. But the increase was much bigger than forecast, and the Office of National Statistics said the fine weather last month had also helped boost high street spending. Boom! UK retail sales volumes have beaten expectations by some margin in April, rising by 2.3% compared to a 1.4% fall in March (itself revised up from an initial estimate of a 1.8% decline.) Expectations had been for a rise of around 1%. The news has sent sterling above $1.30 for the first time since last September, on the basis the strong figures suggest the possibility of an earlier than expected interest rate rise from the Bank of England. But the FTSE 100 has fallen further, down 72 points or 0.96%, which is not surprising given that the overseas earners which dominate the leading index benefit from a weaker pound. The sell-off in shares may not last, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index Direct: European markets have opened lower once again as they digest the latest news that Congress is officially investigating the Trump/ Comey claims and demanding that the FBI hand over the Comey memo that states President Trump put pressure on the FBI chief to drop an investigation into his National Security Advisor. But, the selloff may not last as US futures are actually predicting a positive open for US stocks later today. We will be watching the futures markets to see if sentiment towards US markets change, but after Wednesday\u2019s steep sell off, a bit of profit-taking is to be expected. However, this does not mean that the political risks are put to bed, if this crisis continues to escalate then we would expect a further sharp reaction in the markets. Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday that he was amazed that investors had become so blas\u00e9 about political risk, until it was staring them in the face. If the political genie has escaped from the bottle, then it could be an edgy summer for investors as they remain cautious about the political outlook for the US. We continue to think that the bar to impeachment is high, after all, there are some questionable aspects to Comey\u2019s character (remember the reopening of the Hillary emailgate a few weeks before last year\u2019s election?), and the Republican Congress may be wary of starting proceedings that could impeach their own President. However, if it does come to this then we would expect to see both the dollar and US stocks slide sharply and in tandem, which would be a clear sign that the political situation in the US had taken a severe turn for the worse. The \u201cleak\u201d comment refers to this (\u00a3). Earlier, new figures showed France\u2019s unemployment rate dipped slightly in the first quarter. It fell from 10% in the previous quarter to 9.6%, according to the national statistics office. The dip is a bit of good news from new French president Emmanuel Macron and his new government. ING Bank economist Julien Manceaux said: Figures just published by the INSEE show that unemployment went down by 0.4ppt in the first quarter, reaching less than 10% for the first time since 2012. At 9.6%, it certainly remains a challenge for [the] new government. Its members are known since yesterday, a choice that respects a very delicate equilibrium between right and left, men and women, politicians and civil society members. At this stage, the main question is if it will survive the June legislative elections... The [unemployment] trend is yet to be confirmed in coming quarters however, as the unemployed population increased by 41k in the first quarter after having declined by 60k in the second half of 2016. The move was mainly due to the fact that one part of the population under training or subsidised jobs reintegrated the main unemployment statistics as they failed to find a job after this period. This illustrates the weakness of the subsidised system: without a strong recovery in private sector job creation, it can only be a temporary success. These difficulties were illustrated this morning by ILO data showing that the employment rate failed to increase among the active population it remained at 64.7%. Finally, figures released this morning showed in particular that unemployment among the youngest workers (15-24 y.o) remains very high at 21.8%. This is probably the main task of the new Government, in particular for Mrs Penicaud, the new labour Minister who was one of the surprises of yesterday\u2019s announcement. Mrs Penicaud, a business school professor, has occupied several managerial positions in the private sector (Dassault, Danone, Orange) but also in public companies (SNCF, Paris Airports). She is expected to bring a liberal touch to the future labour market reforms, but is already facing a strike in her own ministry this week by the main left-wing union CGT. Royal Mail is also among the leading risers despite a fall in profits and a warning that letter volumes would continue to drop. Annual profits fell 6% to \u00a3712m, after the uncertainty over Brexit hit marketing and business mail, while it also continues to face growing competition for parcel delivery from the likes of Amazon. It is also in talks with unions about plans to close its defined benefit pension scheme. Chief executive Moya Greene said the company had come through a challenging period well, and with cost cutting and more efficient investment spending, it would maintain \u201ca progressive dividend policy.\u201d Richard Hunter, head of research at Wilson King Investment Management, said: Royal Mail has registered delivery of a solid set of numbers, underpinned by a strong contribution from the overseas unit. The general trend to which the group continues to react is becoming established \u2013 a letters and cards market in terminal decline, offset by the growth in the parcel delivery space as online shopping strengthens its grip on consumer behaviour. Within the numbers, there are a number of promising signs, such as the investment programme having peaked, cost savings still in focus, an improvement to the earnings per share metric and a short-term boost expected by general election mailings. Meanwhile, the dividend yield of 5.2% is extremely attractive in the current environment and remains possible given the group\u2019s cashflow. Elsewhere, recent moves to alter the pension scheme should provide financial solace further out. Challenges inevitably remain with the current uncertainty within UK PLC as the Brexit negotiations unfold impacting expenditure decisions, whilst the entrance of other large players into the lucrative parcels arena will pile further pressure on trading conditions. In addition, whilst there are some positive signals, progress will need to be maintained since the letters business revenue must be replaced in due course. Even so, the general direction of travel is encouraging. The shares have had a difficult year, dipping 14% over the last 12 months and remaining some way off their highs of over \u00a36 in January 2014 following the initial success of the IPO. The company is, nonetheless, focussing on those areas which are particularly troublesome, and the consensus of the shares as a hold may come under review after these results. As expected European markets have slipped back in early trading, following the slump on Wall Street and overnight declines in Asia, on the latest Trump developments. The FTSE 100 has fallen around 45 points or 0.6% while Germany\u2019s Dax opened 0.2% lower and France\u2019s Cac down 0.1%. Among the risers is Burberry, up 1.7% after the luxury goods group issued a positive outlook statement despite a 21% fall in full year pretax profits stripping out the benefits of the falling pound. The drop was in line with expectations and came after weak demand in the US. Investors were cheered by news the group planned a new \u00a3300m buyback to be completed in 2018. Ahead of the UK retail sales, the pound is have a mixed time. Against the dollar it is currently down 0.15% at $1.2950 but it has edged up 0.14% against the euro to \u20ac1.1635, reversing the previous day\u2019s trend. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga said: April\u2019s UK retail sales report... will be vital in providing some insight over the behaviour of consumers amid Brexit developments. With wage growth lagging behind inflation, the sales data may come under scrutiny for any signs of falling wages impacting consumer confidence. If retail sales fail to meet expectations and follow the same pattern as they did in March, concerns are likely to heighten over the sustainability of the UK\u2019s consumer-driven economic growth. Although markets are expecting retail sales to rebound in April to 1% due to the Easter holiday, this still may not be convincing enough to brush away Brexit concerns. The Bank of England has already warned of a consumer spending squeeze while the uncertainty blanketing Brexit continues to weigh on sentiment. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It was only a couple of days ago that all the talk was of new stock market peaks and low volatility. But thanks to the escalating controversy over Donald Trump\u2019s firing of FBI director James Comey and even talk of possible impeachment, the mood has changed dramatically. US markets suffered their biggest one day fall since September, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 372 points, while the dollar lost all the gains it made since Trump was elected president. The US currency and stock markets had been boosted by Trump\u2019s promises of tax reforms and infrastructure spending, but his current problems mean these proposals are on the backburner. And the prospect of a rate rise by the US Federal Reserve next month, almost a given a couple of days ago, now looks more unlikely amid a potential political crisis. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: With the VIX languishing at multi year lows only a couple of days ago it was perhaps inevitable that the low volatility of the past few weeks would in all likelihood end rather abruptly, with the only unknown being as to what the catalyst might be. As it turns out it was events in Washington DC that delivered investors the kick in their complacency that many had been warning about, as stock markets and the US dollar fell sharply, while safe haven assets like gold surged.... Having waited months for evidence that we would eventually see something resembling a reform program and fiscal stimulus to justify the rally in the US dollar and stock markets since November, investors finally lost patience amid a selling frenzy with US markets posting their biggest one day loss since September last year. The big question now is whether this turns out to be the start along a road to an impeachment process or whether this is another bump in the road. The risks to global markets from Trump\u2019s woes is considerable, given how far they have climbed on the back of his long awaited measures to stimulate the US economy. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: The past six-month\u2019s reflation rally would face severe reversal risks. If the markets were to retrace the Trump-reflation gains, this would trigger a decent \u2018deflation\u2019 squeeze. A quick glance to recent stock price history could give an indication of the risks. The Dow Jones rallied from 17,480 to above 21,100 following Donald Trump\u2019s victory on November 9 election; this is roughly a 21% rise... Unfortunately, the US stocks are not the only ones concerned. The global Trumpflation virus contaminated the major stock markets across the globe. Since November 9, the German DAX rallied more than 26%, Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 gained past 12%, the Japanese Nikkei stepped up to 24%, the Australian ASX 200 soared nearly 18% before the sell-off started at the beginning of May and the UK\u2019s FTSE rose by more than 12%. Even the Brazilian stocks believed in the reflation story for a moment and added 22% between December and February. Of course, Brazil has got its own problems. Brazil is plunging back to a bribery crisis concerning its newly elected President Michel Temer \u2013 following the former President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s impeachment last year. Overnight the Nikkei followed Wall Street\u2019s lead lower, ending down 1.32%, while European markets are also expected to open on the back foot: Meanwhile the fall in the dollar has benefited the pound, but that has disguised a general weakness for the UK currency which has fallen back against the euro. But UK retail sales figures due shortly could well give the pound some support. After a poor month in March, when retail sales fell 1.8%, they are expected to recover some lost ground. CMC\u2019s Hewson explains: While March was a surprisingly bad month, it could merely been a case of consumers holding back ahead of Easter, as all the indicators seen in recent data from food retailers suggested that shoppers recovered some of their mojo in April. The latest BRC retail sales numbers from last week showed that, and today\u2019s retail sales numbers are expected to show a rise of 1.2%. There are also a host of company results out today - typically for a Thursday. We will be following all the major events of the day.",

Looking ahead to the Governing Council\u2019s 7-8 June monetary policy meeting, a new round of Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections and a new assessment of the risks to the outlook would become available to inform discussions on the way forward.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cc5a903e4c01ee4a2542a790b5256df6fc69613\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cc5a903e4c01ee4a2542a790b5256df6fc69613/140_0_3138_1855/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Praet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"591\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Praet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Medina/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-591d8859e4b0a9ae59334d8d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-18T11:46:41.275Z\">12.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/apr/27/markets-trump-tax-plan-european-central-bank-draghi-business-live?page=with:block-5901f46ae4b08d339d3625a0#block-5901f46ae4b08d339d3625a0\">last month\u2019s regular meeting</a> the European Central Bank kept its interest rate policy and bond buying programme unchanged, with the eurozone economy improving but the inflation outlook subdued. In <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2017/html/ecb.mg170518.en.html\">the minutes of the meeting</a> just released, the ECB expands on this:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While there was broad agreement that the configuration of risks to euro area activity had improved overall, some members considered that the risks to real GDP could now be characterised as broadly balanced, in particular given the improvement in recent data and indicators and the decline in political uncertainty. Other members maintained that downside risks to growth still prevailed and that a change in the risk assessment was premature in view of continued risks and uncertainties, even if diminishing, both globally and in the euro area.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is more detail on the outlook and the risks involved: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Members exchanged views on the outlook and risks for the external environment, also taking into account the latest IMF World Economic Outlook, which had been released after the Governing Council meeting in early March, and the related discussions at the IMF spring meetings. It was underlined that the latest data on global activity and trade pointed to stronger global growth momentum and a re-synchronisation of the recovery, between global growth and trade and between advanced and emerging economies. However, the external outlook was considered to be still subject to elevated uncertainty, and the balance of risks to the outlook for global growth was assessed to remain on the downside. </p> <p>Among the factors that continued to contribute to this uncertainty were the scope and timing of the future policy choices of the new US Administration, the economic impact of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, the rebalancing of demand and the transition towards lower growth rates in China, and developments in other emerging market economies. In particular, reference was made in the discussion to the high degree of uncertainty surrounding short-term developments in the US economy, which reflected a significant divergence between hard and soft data for the United States. Moreover, financial market participants and investors were reassessing the outlook for US growth and inflation, as it appeared that US data were no longer exceeding market expectations, and there was still considerable uncertainty surrounding the new US Administration\u2019s policies, including the prospects for fiscal stimulus, and their likely expansionary effects. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-591d8340e4b0ca009308d9b7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/larryelliott\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-18T11:21:20.111Z\">12.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>April\u2019s UK retail sales figures should be treated with a little caution, says economics editor Larry Elliott:</p> <blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/18/uk-retail-sales-best-forecasts-despite-pay-squeeze\">Britain went on a spending spree in April. </a>The shops were full of punters.

But in fact the figures beat expectations handsomely, with sales in April 2.3% higher than in March and growing 4.0% year-on-year. April\u2019s figures were always expected to be better than March, because of the timing of the Easter holiday, but economists had forecast a smaller rebound of 1.0%, and much more subdued annual growth of 2.0%. </em></p> <p><em>The ONS says April\u2019s warm weather encouraged people to spend on food, home improvements and gardening equipment.</em></p> <p><em>The balance of probability suggests that at some point the combination of higher inflation and lacklustre wage growth will take its toll on the UK consumer. But today\u2019s numbers provide some welcome evidence the economy has made a brighter start to the second quarter following disappointing GDP growth of 0.3% in Q1. With the labour market looking relatively robust, it\u2019s possible the current mood of pessimism is unjustified.</em></p> <h2>Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit:</h2> <p><em>April\u2019s sharp rebound in retail sales gives a boost to second quarter GDP growth prospects. It buoys hopes that consumer spending will not hamper UK GDP growth as it clearly did in the first quarter.</em> <em>It is evident that the more than halving of UK GDP growth to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2017 (from 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016) was primarily the consequence of previously buoyant consumers reining in their spending as purchasing power was hit hard by inflation and low earnings growth combined.</em></p> <p><em>However, April\u2019s jump in retail sales looks unlikely to mark the beginning of a renewed upturn in consumer spending given the sharp and increasing squeeze on purchasing power.</em></p> <p><em>April\u2019s decent rebound in retail sales was clearly helped substantially by warm weather lifted sales of outdoor products. There is also the possibility that the later Easter had some beneficial impact although the ONS indicated that the data are seasonally-adjusted to allow for this.</em></p> <p><em>The suspicion is that it needs something special like markedly warmer weather to currently get consumers to really loosen their purse strings, given the marked dilution of their purchasing power in recent months.</em></p> <p><em>Worryingly for UK growth prospects, the squeeze on consumers looks highly likely tighten further over the coming months as rising inflation eats further into purchasing power with the pressure reinforced by ongoing muted earnings growth...</em></p> <p><em>There is also a strong likelihood that consumer confidence and willingness to buy major items will soften \u2013 as it is not only pressurised by weakened purchasing power but also by increasing concerns over the economy and perhaps job security...</em></p> <p><em>It is also questionable as to whether the labour market can continue to hold up given the growth slowdown and uncertain outlook (including likely difficult Brexit negotiations with the EU coming increasingly coming to the forefront after the 8 June general election is done and dusted.</em></p> <h2>James Smith, economist at ING Bank:</h2> <p><em>A big rebound in retail sales is likely to prove temporary, as the ongoing squeeze on household incomes starts to weigh more heavily on consumer activity over coming months.</em></p> <p><em>Today\u2019s retail sales data was clearly boosted by warmer weather and a late Easter, which helps retailers sell their summer wares (particularly clothing and household/garden items) in higher volumes, but also at more profitable prices. A rainy, cold early Easter makes the lives of retailers much trickier in this respect.</em></p> <p><em>Whilst that is likely to account for much of April\u2019s 2% MoM gain in retail sales (ex. auto fuel), we have to remember that these figures are extremely volatile. It\u2019s very likely that there are seasonal adjustment issues, as statisticians struggle to keep pace with ever-changing consumer habits \u2013 the rise of Black Friday style sales is a good example.</em></p> <p><em>To us, today\u2019s data doesn\u2019t change the underlying story, where the squeeze in household incomes is starting to weigh on consumer activity. This week\u2019s surge in inflation (2.7%) and subdued wage growth (2.1%) means real incomes are now falling. It\u2019s also worth noting that much of the strength in consumption over the past few months has been driven in no-small-part by higher borrowing and lower savings, which is unlikely to prove sustainable.</em></p> <p><em>For that reason, we don\u2019t expect the Bank of England to hike rates before 2019.</em></p> <p><em><br></em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-591d6050e4b03ddbc8d5a978\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-18T08:50:47.289Z\">9.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a breakdown of the retail sectors:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b07cf4adcc71807455d95840e9d976bb2d05538\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b07cf4adcc71807455d95840e9d976bb2d05538/0_0_705_662/500.jpg\" alt=\"retasles1\" width=\"500\" height=\"470\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-591d5e4be4b0a9ae59334caa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-18T08:42:47.524Z\">9.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sterling could move even higher, according to David Cheetham, chief market analyst at online trader XTB:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pound is trading higher across the board this morning and the recovery seen in the currency since hitting a multi-decade low in January has been impressive and looks set to continue.

At 9.6%, it certainly remains a challenge for [the] new government. Its members are known since yesterday, a choice that respects a very delicate equilibrium between right and left, men and women, politicians and civil society members. At this stage, the main question is if it will survive the June legislative elections...</p> <p>The [unemployment] trend is yet to be confirmed in coming quarters however, as the unemployed population increased by 41k in the first quarter after having declined by 60k in the second half of 2016. The move was mainly due to the fact that one part of the population under training or subsidised jobs reintegrated the main unemployment statistics as they failed to find a job after this period. This illustrates the weakness of the subsidised system: without a strong recovery in private sector job creation, it can only be a temporary success. These difficulties were illustrated this morning by ILO data showing that the employment rate failed to increase among the active population it remained at 64.7%. Finally, figures released this morning showed in particular that unemployment among the youngest workers (15-24 y.o) remains very high at 21.8%.</p> <p>This is probably the main task of the new Government, in particular for Mrs Penicaud, the new labour Minister who was one of the surprises of yesterday\u2019s announcement. Mrs Penicaud, a business school professor, has occupied several managerial positions in the private sector (Dassault, Danone, Orange) but also in public companies (SNCF, Paris Airports). She is expected to bring a liberal touch to the future labour market reforms, but is already facing a strike in her own ministry this week by the main left-wing union CGT.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-591d4905e4b0a9ae59334c5f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-05-18T07:30:24.325Z\">8.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Royal Mail profits fall but shares rise</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Royal Mail is also among the leading risers despite a fall in profits and a warning that letter volumes would continue to drop.</p> <p>Annual profits fell 6% to \u00a3712m, after the uncertainty over Brexit hit marketing and business mail, while it also continues to face growing competition for parcel delivery from the likes of Amazon.

Within the numbers, there are a number of promising signs, such as the investment programme having peaked, cost savings still in focus, an improvement to the earnings per share metric and a short-term boost expected by general election mailings.

But thanks to the escalating controversy over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/17/trump-russia-investigation-special-counsel-robert-mueller-fbi\">Donald Trump\u2019s firing of FBI director James Comey</a> and even talk of possible impeachment, the mood has changed dramatically.</p> <p>US markets suffered their biggest one day fall since September, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 372 points, while the dollar lost all the gains it made since Trump was elected president. The US currency and stock markets had been boosted by Trump\u2019s promises of tax reforms and infrastructure spending, but his current problems mean these proposals are on the backburner. And the prospect of a rate rise by the US Federal Reserve next month, almost a given a couple of days ago, now looks more unlikely amid a potential political crisis. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:<strong> </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With the VIX languishing at multi year lows only a couple of days ago it was perhaps inevitable that the low volatility of the past few weeks would in all likelihood end rather abruptly, with the only unknown being as to what the catalyst might be. </p> <p>As it turns out it was events in Washington DC that delivered investors the kick in their complacency that many had been warning about, as stock markets and the US dollar fell sharply, while safe haven assets like gold surged....</p> <p>Having waited months for evidence that we would eventually see something resembling a reform program and fiscal stimulus to justify the rally in the US dollar and stock markets since November, investors finally lost patience amid a selling frenzy with US markets posting their biggest one day loss since September last year. </p> <p>The big question now is whether this turns out to be the start along a road to an impeachment process or whether this is another bump in the road.</p> </blockquote> <p>The risks to global markets from Trump\u2019s woes is considerable, given how far they have climbed on the back of his long awaited measures to stimulate the US economy. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The past six-month\u2019s reflation rally would face severe reversal risks. If the markets were to retrace the Trump-reflation gains, this would trigger a decent \u2018deflation\u2019 squeeze. A quick glance to recent stock price history could give an indication of the risks. The Dow Jones rallied from 17,480 to above 21,100 following Donald Trump\u2019s victory on November 9 election; this is roughly a 21% rise...</p> <p>Unfortunately, the US stocks are not the only ones concerned. The global Trumpflation virus contaminated the major stock markets across the globe. Since November 9, the German DAX rallied more than 26%, Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 gained past 12%, the Japanese Nikkei stepped up to 24%, the Australian ASX 200 soared nearly 18% before the sell-off started at the beginning of May and the UK\u2019s FTSE rose by more than 12%. Even the Brazilian stocks believed in the reflation story for a moment and added 22% between December and February. Of course, Brazil has got its own problems. Brazil is plunging back to a bribery crisis concerning its newly elected President Michel Temer \u2013 following the former President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s impeachment last year.</p> </blockquote> <p>Overnight the Nikkei followed Wall Street\u2019s lead lower, ending down 1.32%, while European markets are also expected to open on the back foot:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/865080077016473600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our European opening calls:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTSE&amp;src=ctag\">$FTSE</a> 7456 -0.63%<br>$DAX\u00a012584 -0.37%<br>$CAC\u00a05292 -0.50%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBEX&amp;src=ctag\">$IBEX</a> 10743 -0.40%<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MIB&amp;src=ctag\">$MIB</a> 21213 -0.33%</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/865080077016473600\">May 18, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Meanwhile the fall in the dollar has benefited the pound, but that has disguised a general weakness for the UK currency which has fallen back against the euro.</p> <p>But UK retail sales figures due shortly could well give the pound some support. After a poor month in March, when retail sales fell 1.8%, they are expected to recover some lost ground. CMC\u2019s Hewson explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While March was a surprisingly bad month, it could merely been a case of consumers holding back ahead of Easter, as all the indicators seen in recent data from food retailers suggested that shoppers recovered some of their mojo in April. The latest BRC retail sales numbers from last week showed that, and today\u2019s retail sales numbers are expected to show a rise of 1.2%. </p> </blockquote> <p>There are also a host of company results out today - typically for a Thursday. We will be following all the major events of the day.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-05-18T06:45:32.463Z\">at 7.45am BST</time></p>  </div>",

    "webTitle": "$6.40 an hour and a few raises in nine years: how I got stuck in a Walmart career", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "\u201cYou don\u2019t know shit!\u201d is a hard lesson to swallow, but it was one of the first things I learned when I started my nine-year career as a sales and inventory control associate at a Walmart in Laramie, Wyoming. When I was hired by the company at $6.40 an hour, I believed I would only be working there for a few months before I landed a cool gig at a non-profit in Denver, or had my manuscript discovered by Random House. I had dropped out of college to pursue my dream of becoming the next Stephen King. I thought I was wise beyond my years and looked down on many of my new co-workers: soon I would be living in Denver, Santa Fe, or even New York City while they would still be stuck at the local Walmart. Of course, my Gothic novel was not picked up by a fancy publisher, and soon the harsh reality set in: no one would be hiring a kid from Wyoming with only a high school degree and no work experience in the midst of the recession. Almost nine years later, I was still working at the same store. I was broke, in debt, and Walmart was one of the few employment options in town. I earned around $2,000 a month after putting in a lot of hours and snatching up overtime whenever it was offered, working 11 days in a row or taking long shifts. After paying $475 for rent, $193 a month on my car, $75 per month for car insurance, utilities, phone, basic cable, food, minimum payments on my credit card debt that were over $100, taxes (single working people making over the poverty level usually do not get any tax deductions), and $230 a month for health insurance, I had little left over. I felt like a failure with no future, no money, no assets, and lots of credit card debt. The small savings I accumulated would quickly disappear into an emergency car repair for the six-mile round trip to work (especially necessary during the cold, windy winter), or were used to pay the doctor for necessary care out of my pocket because my health insurance plan had a $7,500 deductible. Walmart did offer steady hours and, if you could afford the deductions from your paycheck, provided health, dental, and disability insurance. We received paid sick days and vacation time \u2013 although you had to work an entire year before you were granted a single precious week of vacation. I was disillusioned with politicians on both sides of the aisle who didn\u2019t seem to give a damn about people who weren\u2019t in poverty but made less than $30,000 a year. I made too much to qualify for federal tax credits to buy inexpensive health insurance under Obamacare. My premiums rose every year, and soon health insurance was my second highest personal expenditure after rent. Politicians gave lip service to tax cuts and programs for the \u201cmiddle class,\u201d but never seemed to mention the \u201cworking class.\u201d And before you ask why I did not do everything I could to leave, well \u2013 I truly felt working at Walmart was the only option open to me at the time. Few places in town offered the steady hours and limited benefits that Walmart did. I lacked the self-confidence to return to college as a non-traditional student, had limited financial resources to move to a different city, and perhaps most importantly, I didn\u2019t believe I had any social connections outside of Laramie to help me start a new life somewhere else. These factors fueled anger and resentment. I am ashamed that on occasion, in order to hide my own personal frustrations and insecurities about my queerness, I participated in racism, sexism, and homophobia in an attempt to fit in with the guys at work. However, most of my anger was directed at older co-workers who had worked at Walmart for a long time. My biggest fear was becoming one of \u201cthem,\u201d a \u201clifer\u201d stuck at Walmart, and I treated them with contempt. Thankfully, a co-worker named Nathan taught me humility, kindness and respect for those who worked hard and cared about their jobs in the low paying service sector. A year into my Walmart career, Nathan and I were unloading a refrigerated truck, or \u201creefer.\u201d No one liked that task. Hauling unstable pallets stacked 9ft high with several tons of dairy and frozen goods from a frigid, dark trailer with a handheld pallet jack was hard work. Plus, the drivers were often cranky after battling Wyoming\u2019s endless headwinds on long hauls across the state\u2019s vast expanses. Nathan was older than me (no one knew his exact age \u2013 he told us he was born on a leap year and was about 12 years old). He grew up on a nearby ranch and never went to college. His parents died decades ago and left him with crippling property taxes and mortgages on the family property. He ended up at Walmart after he was laid off from a local lumber factory when the company folded without notice and left the workers without their last paycheck. Nathan firmly believed that any form of federal intervention in his personal life was \u201ccommunism.\u201d His idea of foreign policy was to \u201cblast the Middle East into one big, gleaming sheet of glass.\u201d That evening, the truck driver informed Nathan and I that we had to move pallets that belonged to another store to access our freight. Walmart was cutting down on mileage and truck routes, and the trailers were packed to the breaking point with deliveries. As a result, we often had to play a strenuous game of musical chairs with pallets to get our freight unloaded. That day, our only option was to haul the pallets down a long narrow hall lined with 50lb bags of dog food, through a swinging door, and into the meat preparation room. Our shift was nearly over. The driver was pacing around the backroom, shouting at us to get the trailer unloaded before his hair turned gray. \u201cScrew the rules,\u201d Nathan said, \u201cLet\u2019s leave the other store\u2019s pallets right here and get the job done before the driver has a coronary.\u201d I disagreed and insisted that we follow the rules and take the freight to the meat prep room. I was not about to let this lifer tell me what to do. \u201cWe have to do this my way,\u201d I said, \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing!\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know shit!\u201d Nathan shouted back. I immediately threatened to call a manager, and started down the hallway with my pallet. Nathan eventually followed behind, cursing me all the way to the meat room. I yanked my pallet hard through the swinging doors. The top layer of freight caught in the doorway and boxes of grape juice went flying. The floor in the meat room was wet and I slipped and fell back hard, the wind knocked out of me. I lay there, my tailbone and my pride sore, water soaking my workpants. Nathan quietly came into the prep room. He asked if I was OK, gently pulled me to my feet, and helped me clean up. Nathan never told anyone about my humiliation, and I never disrespected him again. Over the years, I learned that Nathan was quick to forgive, and would drop everything to assist anyone who needed help. Despite his not-so-politically-correct, rightwing remarks and jokes, Nathan greeted and talked to everyone he encountered with genuine respect and kindness, regardless of that person\u2019s age, gender, or ethnicity. Soon we started to enjoy each other\u2019s company at work.As a team we unloaded hundreds of trucks, stocked millions of cases of freight, and solved the endless daily crises that came up at work. And eventually, I got the courage up to take out loans and finish my undergraduate studies at the local university. I quit Walmart after my acceptance into a graduate program that offered free health insurance and paid a stipend comparable to what I made working full-time. My decision was motivated largely by a friendship I formed with another co-worker named Ryan. We hung out because we had a lot in common: we were both quiet, shared a birthday, were left-handed, and liked similar music and books. After years of working in fast food, Ryan had made the decision to return to school and was working to fund his education. Despite the financial obstacles and his own personal fears, he took a big step to change his life. I had a lot of respect for him, and eventually my desire for him to return my admiration led me to change my life. I don\u2019t miss unloading trucks, but I do not regret the years I spent working at Walmart, especially because of the lessons my co-workers taught me: humility, patience, and respect for those scratching out a living in the low-paying retail sector.

My biggest fear was becoming one of \u201cthem,\u201d a \u201clifer\u201d stuck at Walmart, and I treated them with contempt.</p> <p>Thankfully, a co-worker named Nathan taught me humility, kindness and respect for those who worked hard and cared about their jobs in the low paying service sector.</p> <p>A year into my Walmart career, Nathan and I were unloading a refrigerated truck, or \u201creefer.\u201d No one liked that task. Hauling unstable pallets stacked 9ft high with several tons of dairy and frozen goods from a frigid, dark trailer with a handheld pallet jack was hard work. Plus, the drivers were often cranky after battling Wyoming\u2019s endless headwinds on long hauls across the state\u2019s vast expanses.</p> <p>Nathan was older than me (no one knew his exact age \u2013 he told us he was born on a leap year and was about 12 years old). He grew up on a nearby ranch and never went to college. His parents died decades ago and left him with crippling property taxes and mortgages on the family property. He ended up at Walmart after he was laid off from a local lumber factory when the company folded without notice and left the workers without their last paycheck.</p> <p>Nathan firmly believed that any form of federal intervention in his personal life was \u201ccommunism.\u201d His idea of foreign policy was to \u201cblast the Middle East into one big, gleaming sheet of glass.\u201d</p> <p>That evening, the truck driver informed Nathan and I that we had to move pallets that belonged to another store to access our freight. Walmart was cutting down on mileage and truck routes, and the trailers were packed to the breaking point with deliveries. As a result, we often had to play a strenuous game of musical chairs with pallets to get our freight unloaded.</p> <p>That day, our only option was to haul the pallets down a long narrow hall lined with 50lb bags of dog food, through a swinging door, and into the meat preparation room.</p> <p>Our shift was nearly over. The driver was pacing around the backroom, shouting at us to get the trailer unloaded before his hair turned gray.</p> <p>\u201cScrew the rules,\u201d Nathan said, \u201cLet\u2019s leave the other store\u2019s pallets right here and get the job done before the driver has a coronary.\u201d</p> <p>I disagreed and insisted that we follow the rules and take the freight to the meat prep room. I was not about to let this lifer tell me what to do.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to do this my way,\u201d I said, \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know shit!\u201d Nathan shouted back.</p> <p>I immediately threatened to call a manager, and started down the hallway with my pallet. Nathan eventually followed behind, cursing me all the way to the meat room. I yanked my pallet hard through the swinging doors. The top layer of freight caught in the doorway and boxes of grape juice went flying. The floor in the meat room was wet and I slipped and fell back hard, the wind knocked out of me.</p> <p>I lay there, my tailbone and my pride sore, water soaking my workpants. Nathan quietly came into the prep room. He asked if I was OK, gently pulled me to my feet, and helped me clean up.</p> <p>Nathan never told anyone about my humiliation, and I never disrespected him again. Over the years, I learned that Nathan was quick to forgive, and would drop everything to assist anyone who needed help. Despite his not-so-politically-correct, rightwing remarks and jokes, Nathan greeted and talked to everyone he encountered with genuine respect and kindness, regardless of that person\u2019s age, gender, or ethnicity. Soon we started to enjoy each other\u2019s company at work.As a team we unloaded hundreds of trucks, stocked millions of cases of freight, and solved the endless daily crises that came up at work.</p> <p>And eventually, I got the courage up to take out loans and finish my undergraduate studies at the local university.</p> <p>I quit Walmart after my acceptance into a graduate program that offered free health insurance and paid a stipend comparable to what I made working full-time. My decision was motivated largely by a friendship I formed with another co-worker named Ryan. We hung out because we had a lot in common: we were both quiet, shared a birthday, were left-handed, and liked similar music and books.</p> <p>After years of working in fast food, Ryan had made the decision to return to school and was working to fund his education. Despite the financial obstacles and his own personal fears, he took a big step to change his life. I had a lot of respect for him, and eventually my desire for him to return my admiration led me to change my life.</p> <p>I don\u2019t miss unloading trucks, but I do not regret the years I spent working at Walmart, especially because of the lessons my co-workers taught me: humility, patience, and respect for those scratching out a living in the low-paying retail sector.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 22 May 2017.

      "bodyText": "Facebook has been fined \u20ac110m (\u00a394m) by the EU for providing misleading information about its 2014 takeover of WhatsApp. The European commission said it had imposed a \u201cproportionate\u201d fine on the technology company to send a clear signal that all firms must comply with EU competition rules. When Facebook took over the WhatsApp messaging service in 2014, it told the commission it would not be able to match user accounts on both platforms, but went on to do exactly that. The commission found that Facebook staff knew in 2014 that it was technically possible to link WhatsApp phone numbers with Facebook users\u2019 identities, contrary to their public statements about the merger. In a statement Facebook said the errors were not intentional and noted that the commission confirmed these submissions had not changed the outcome of the merger inquiry. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement brings this matter to a close,\u201d Facebook said. The fine could have been more than twice the size, as competition authorities are able to fine rule-breaking companies 1% of annual turnover, which for Facebook was $276m (\u00a3211m) in 2016. But the commission said it had taken into account the company\u2019s cooperation during the inquiry. The decision to allow the Facebook-WhatsApp merger is unaffected by the latest announcement, the commission said. \u201cToday\u2019s decision sends a clear signal to companies that they must comply with all aspects of EU merger rules, including the obligation to provide correct information,\u2019\u201d said the EU competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager. \u201cIt imposes a proportionate and deterrent fine on Facebook. The commission must be able to take decisions about mergers\u2019 effects on competition in full knowledge of accurate facts.\u201d The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) said it was disappointing that the commission had not revised its original decision in favour of the merger. \u201cIt is crucial in our data economy that competition bodies more closely scrutinise the potential consumer harm of a merger between data-heavy companies,\u201d said the BEUC director general, Monique Goyens. \u201cThe commission failed to do so when it gave the go-ahead to the Facebook-WhatsApp takeover.\u201d The European commission stressed the latest fine was unrelated to national antitrust inquiries. The German cartel office is investigating whether Facebook is abusing its dominant position by failing to inform people about how their personal data is being used. Investigations are also under way in Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. A French data watchdog fined Facebook \u20ac150,000 on Tuesday for failing to prevent users\u2019 data being accessed by advertisers. Speaking ahead of the announcement, Vestager said she was closely watching the outcome of investigations by the German authorities and others, while noting that \u201cin our legislation you can be dominant without necessarily breaking any rules\u201d. EU officials are assessing whether competition rules need to be updated to reflect the power of data-rich companies. The last big revision of EU merger rules was in 2004, the year Mark Zuckerberg launched \u2018The Facebook\u2019 at Harvard University, when WhatsApp founders were still working at the then internet powerhouse Yahoo. The commission assess mergers using the metric of turnover, which critics say fails to capture the potential of a tech startup with zero revenues, but big potential. Consumer organisations are pressing for Brussels to take account of the number of consumers affected by a merger to assess whether it would create a monopoly. In a recent interview Vestager said it was tricky to find an alternative metric to turnover, for assets, such as knowledge, patents or data. \u201cWe try to prepare ourselves to make sure we have the right set of glasses to make sure we can see what is going on when it comes to data,\u201d Vestager told the Guardian. \u201cData is a currency, it is a resource it is an asset and it will play an enormous role in the entire economy which is why with other colleagues here we are playing close attention to it.\u201d",
