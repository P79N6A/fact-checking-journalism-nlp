      "bodyText": "Sales of autumn collections and back-to-school clothes helped retailers to enjoy a bounceback in sales last month, according to industry figures. However, the British Retail Consortium added that steep discounting meant grocers continued to suffer from falling takings on food sales. The BRC said that across all goods, sales were up 1.3% on a year ago in like-for-like terms in August. That was the strongest growth since January, with the exception of April when sales were distorted by Easter being late in the month. But the pick-up followed falling sales in June and July \u2013 so on the less volatile measure of sales over three months there was no growth compared with a year ago. The BRC said the rise in August sales was driven by clothing and footwear, with the weather having an impact. \"Retailers were blessed with a hot start of the month during their summer clearances, followed by a showery and cooler second half, making the new autumn ranges attractive and relevant as they arrived on display,\" its sales report said. Strong back-to-school sales helped, as did dressing-up outfits themed around Disney's Frozen film, which \"proved extremely popular and sold out very quickly online\", the BRC added. Furniture sales also performed well against the backdrop of a buoyant housing market. But food sales fell in both total and like-for-like terms, and the trade group predicted that pattern would continue for some time, reflecting lower food prices. Helen Dickinson, the director general of the BRC, said: \"Consumers are still taking advantage of record low food inflation. The strength of the economy is not yet consistent across all areas of the country and shop prices fell in August.\" The report echoes the latest official retail sales figures, which showed spending in food stores fell for the first time on record in July as the larger supermarkets continued to cut prices to fight off competition from the German discount food chains Aldi and Lidl. Retail experts say with people's budgets squeezed by years of wages falling in real terms, they are increasingly shopping around for bargains and trying to waste less food. Surveys and official figures have painted a mixed picture in recent months about the extent to which households are feeling the recovery and feeling confident enough to spend more. The real test will be Christmas spending, according to David McCorquodale, the head of retail at the report's co-author, KPMG. \"With autumn drawing in, the countdown to Christmas has now begun. This will be a true bellwether of consumer confidence,\" he said.",

      "standfirst": "Retailer reveals ambition to build substantial chain in \u00a3202bn sector after year in which it closed in on M&amp;S in sales and profits", 
      "body": "<p>Fashion retailer Primark is to plough \u00a3200m into a bid to crack the notoriously difficult US market as it looks to succeed where some of Britain's biggest high street names including Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury's have failed.</p> <p>The retailer will start its campaign by opening a high profile store in central Boston at the end of next year but it is already in talks to open outlets in shopping malls in neighbouring states, including New York and New Jersey \u2013 pointing to ambitions to build a substantial chain in the \u00a3200bn US clothing market.</p> <p>\"We are looking at [retail] hot spots,\" said John Bason, finance director at Primark owner Associated British Foods. \"One of the things about the US is they don't know Primark so we are choosing locations where the people already are.\"</p> <p>The expansion comes hot on the heels of another year of stellar growth in which Primark edged closer to overtaking high street stalwart M&amp;S in sales and profits. Analysts said Primark would contribute operating profits in the region of \u00a3600m to ABF profits, with sales of about \u00a35bn in the year to 13 September.</p> <p>In the year to the end of March M&amp;S's clothing and homewares business had a turnover of just over \u00a35bn putting it neck and neck with Primark. However at 11% M&amp;S's UK clothing market share remains more than twice that of Primark indicating a lot of the low cost fashion chain's growth is coming from expansion overseas.</p> <p>With food included during the period M&amp;S made an operating profit of \u00a3742m on sales of \u00a310.3bn in the year to the end of March.</p> <p>America has been a country too far for most UK retailers: Marks &amp; Spencer, WH Smith, Sainsbury's and, most recently, Tesco have all come unstuck on the other side of the Atlantic. On the other hand fashion chains Topshop and Ted Baker have found an audience with US shoppers.</p> <p>Bason said that in targeting northeastern states Primark was tapping shoppers who were \"European\" in their fashion outlook. \"The US is made up of a number of different markets,\" he said. \"In this area a lot of the influences are more European than in the southern states where there starts to be a Latin American influence.\"</p> <p>The corridor from Boston to Baltimore that Primark is targeting addresses a population of 55m versus 65m the UK. \"This is not a target but in the UK we trade from 5m sq ft of space so you can see what the potential is,\" said Bason who added it would be leasing its stores and warehousing in the US. \"We are looking at a couple of hundred million investment.\"</p> <p>The US venture is an ambitious new chapter for the retailer, which began life in 1969 as a single shop in Dublin under the name Penneys \u2013 the name it still trades under in Ireland. The fledgling chain will be run out of Boston by Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez de Larramendi who built the successful Spanish chain.</p> <p>\"The way things are going, M&amp;S is soon going to be overtaken by Primark,\" said independent retail analyst Nick Bubb. The Primark growth story, he added \"looked more believable than the potential recovery story at M&amp;S\".</p> <p>Excluding the effect of currency moves Primark chalked up annual sales growth of 17% with underlying sales ahead 4.5%. Coming after an 8% surge in the third quarter some analysts were concerned that like-for-like growth had slowed to 3% in the final quarter. Bason countered that Primark had enjoyed exceptional sales in the spring as the warm weather put shoppers in the mood to buy its kimono tops, jumpsuits and platform sandals.</p> <p>Despite the continued success of Primark the impact of falling sugar prices weighed on the firm's shares. As well as Primark, ABF owns several other large businesses including a grocery division which owns household brands such as Twinings, Kingsmill and Patak's and a sugar operation.</p> <p>ABF said the price of sugar had slumped as producers battled to position themselves in new markets ahead of the removal of quotas in 2017.

      "bodyText": "Fashion retailer Primark is to plough \u00a3200m into a bid to crack the notoriously difficult US market as it looks to succeed where some of Britain's biggest high street names including Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury's have failed. The retailer will start its campaign by opening a high profile store in central Boston at the end of next year but it is already in talks to open outlets in shopping malls in neighbouring states, including New York and New Jersey \u2013 pointing to ambitions to build a substantial chain in the \u00a3200bn US clothing market. \"We are looking at [retail] hot spots,\" said John Bason, finance director at Primark owner Associated British Foods. \"One of the things about the US is they don't know Primark so we are choosing locations where the people already are.\" The expansion comes hot on the heels of another year of stellar growth in which Primark edged closer to overtaking high street stalwart M&amp;S in sales and profits. Analysts said Primark would contribute operating profits in the region of \u00a3600m to ABF profits, with sales of about \u00a35bn in the year to 13 September. In the year to the end of March M&amp;S's clothing and homewares business had a turnover of just over \u00a35bn putting it neck and neck with Primark. However at 11% M&amp;S's UK clothing market share remains more than twice that of Primark indicating a lot of the low cost fashion chain's growth is coming from expansion overseas. With food included during the period M&amp;S made an operating profit of \u00a3742m on sales of \u00a310.3bn in the year to the end of March. America has been a country too far for most UK retailers: Marks &amp; Spencer, WH Smith, Sainsbury's and, most recently, Tesco have all come unstuck on the other side of the Atlantic. On the other hand fashion chains Topshop and Ted Baker have found an audience with US shoppers. Bason said that in targeting northeastern states Primark was tapping shoppers who were \"European\" in their fashion outlook. \"The US is made up of a number of different markets,\" he said. \"In this area a lot of the influences are more European than in the southern states where there starts to be a Latin American influence.\" The corridor from Boston to Baltimore that Primark is targeting addresses a population of 55m versus 65m the UK. \"This is not a target but in the UK we trade from 5m sq ft of space so you can see what the potential is,\" said Bason who added it would be leasing its stores and warehousing in the US. \"We are looking at a couple of hundred million investment.\" The US venture is an ambitious new chapter for the retailer, which began life in 1969 as a single shop in Dublin under the name Penneys \u2013 the name it still trades under in Ireland. The fledgling chain will be run out of Boston by Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez de Larramendi who built the successful Spanish chain. \"The way things are going, M&amp;S is soon going to be overtaken by Primark,\" said independent retail analyst Nick Bubb. The Primark growth story, he added \"looked more believable than the potential recovery story at M&amp;S\". Excluding the effect of currency moves Primark chalked up annual sales growth of 17% with underlying sales ahead 4.5%. Coming after an 8% surge in the third quarter some analysts were concerned that like-for-like growth had slowed to 3% in the final quarter. Bason countered that Primark had enjoyed exceptional sales in the spring as the warm weather put shoppers in the mood to buy its kimono tops, jumpsuits and platform sandals. Despite the continued success of Primark the impact of falling sugar prices weighed on the firm's shares. As well as Primark, ABF owns several other large businesses including a grocery division which owns household brands such as Twinings, Kingsmill and Patak's and a sugar operation. ABF said the price of sugar had slumped as producers battled to position themselves in new markets ahead of the removal of quotas in 2017. Bason said the price was now at an \"unsustainably low\" level of 17 cents per pound. The decline meant it would have to look at how to restructure its operations to make them more cost efficient, he said. The sugar division made profits of \u00a3435m last year but analysts at Jefferies estimate that more than halved to about \u00a3200m in the year just ended with a fresh fall predicted in the year ahead. Shares in AB Foods, 55% owned by the Weston family, have jumped nearly 60% over the past year, mainly on the back of Primark's success, but the mixed picture made them the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, closing down more than 2% at \u00a327.57.",

Ryanair has made a firm pledge to buy 100 of the 737 Max 200 planes, with an option on another 100, and O'Leary said Ryanair had never failed to take up options on aircraft it ordered.</p> <p>O'Leary said Ryanair would win business from big flag carrier airlines such as Ailtalia, Lufthansa and British Airways and extend its network to countries such as Israel and Lebanon. \"You see all the failing flag carrier airlines cutting capacity and cutting routes. We intend to use these brilliant new aircraft to expand into those markets and double in size.\"</p> <p>The order for the planes, modified to Ryanair's requirements, is Boeing's biggest from a European airline. O'Leary, who has taken a back seat at Ryanair in recent months, said the new aircraft would be a game-changer, allowing more passenger leg room as well as eight extra seats, which would increase revenues per plane by $1m a year.</p> <p>O'Leary said he had been asking Boeing and its rival Airbus for years to produce a plane with about 200 seats. Boeing agreed to increase the capacity of the 737 Max 200 to 197 seats from 189 in Ryanair's existing 737-800s, taking the budget carrier to a \"sweet spot\" of efficiency, he said.</p> <p>By keeping the number of seats below 200, Ryanair does not have to put an extra flight attendant on the plane because one is required for every 50 passengers.</p> <p>As well as increasing capacity, the planes will cut fuel consumption by up to 18% and noise emissions by 40%.</p> <p>\"I feel like a child who has woken up on Christmas morning and Santa Claus has given him exactly what he is after,\" O'Leary said.</p> <p>The new targets for expansion put Ryanair back on the front foot after profits fell last year and it admitted losing touch with passengers' requirements. The low-cost carrier is trying to improve its service after O'Leary acknowledged it was no longer good business to \"deliberately piss people off\".</p> <p>It has introduced allocated seating, relaxed cabin bag restrictions, reduced charges and loosened booking conditions. Last week the airline <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/03/ryanair-customer-service-profits-passengers\" title=\"\">announced</a> that a record 9.4 million passengers flew Ryanair in August.</p>",

Announcing the deal alongside Boeing's chief executive, Ray Conner, in New York, O'Leary said the bigger fleet would allow Ryanair to increase passenger numbers from 82 million now to more than 150 million by 2024. The deal is worth up to $22bn (\u00a313.6bn) at list prices, though airlines rarely pay the full price on big orders. Ryanair has made a firm pledge to buy 100 of the 737 Max 200 planes, with an option on another 100, and O'Leary said Ryanair had never failed to take up options on aircraft it ordered. O'Leary said Ryanair would win business from big flag carrier airlines such as Ailtalia, Lufthansa and British Airways and extend its network to countries such as Israel and Lebanon. \"You see all the failing flag carrier airlines cutting capacity and cutting routes. We intend to use these brilliant new aircraft to expand into those markets and double in size.\" The order for the planes, modified to Ryanair's requirements, is Boeing's biggest from a European airline. O'Leary, who has taken a back seat at Ryanair in recent months, said the new aircraft would be a game-changer, allowing more passenger leg room as well as eight extra seats, which would increase revenues per plane by $1m a year. O'Leary said he had been asking Boeing and its rival Airbus for years to produce a plane with about 200 seats. Boeing agreed to increase the capacity of the 737 Max 200 to 197 seats from 189 in Ryanair's existing 737-800s, taking the budget carrier to a \"sweet spot\" of efficiency, he said. By keeping the number of seats below 200, Ryanair does not have to put an extra flight attendant on the plane because one is required for every 50 passengers. As well as increasing capacity, the planes will cut fuel consumption by up to 18% and noise emissions by 40%. \"I feel like a child who has woken up on Christmas morning and Santa Claus has given him exactly what he is after,\" O'Leary said. The new targets for expansion put Ryanair back on the front foot after profits fell last year and it admitted losing touch with passengers' requirements. The low-cost carrier is trying to improve its service after O'Leary acknowledged it was no longer good business to \"deliberately piss people off\". It has introduced allocated seating, relaxed cabin bag restrictions, reduced charges and loosened booking conditions. Last week the airline announced that a record 9.4 million passengers flew Ryanair in August.",

I</strong></em>n the UK, a weekend poll showing a majority in Scotland in favour of independence dominated the market, with some \u00a32.6bn wiped off the value of leading shares with Scottish links. Royal Bank of Scotland - which mitigated the damage with news of its flotation of Citizens in the US - ended down 4.5p or \u00a3513m. Lloyds - not able to follow suit with any corporate developments up its sleeve - dropped by \u00a31.28bn. The UK government, already reeling from the weekend poll results, was looking at a near \u00a3500m fall in the value of its stakes in the two banks. In Europe, there was a more mixed performance, with talk that sanctions against Russia could be deferred helping to support the markets and pulling them back from their worst levels. The final scores on the doors showed:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The FTSE 100 finished down 20.33 points or 0.3% at 6834.77</strong></li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.11% to 9758.03</strong></li> <li><strong>France\u2019s Cac closed 0.26% lower at 4474.93</strong></li> <li><strong>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was down 0.47% at 21,294.34</strong></li> <li><strong>Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.42% lower at 11,102.6</strong></li> </ul> <p>In the US, the <strong>Dow Jones Industrial Average </strong>is currently down 21 points or 0.13%. </p> <p>As for <strong>sterling, </strong>it stands at $1.6147, down more than 1% on the day albeit off its worst levels.

      "bodyText": "It was an uncertain day on European markets, with political concerns continuing to weigh on share prices, writes Nick Fletcher. In the UK, a weekend poll showing a majority in Scotland in favour of independence dominated the market, with some \u00a32.6bn wiped off the value of leading shares with Scottish links. Royal Bank of Scotland - which mitigated the damage with news of its flotation of Citizens in the US - ended down 4.5p or \u00a3513m. Lloyds - not able to follow suit with any corporate developments up its sleeve - dropped by \u00a31.28bn. The UK government, already reeling from the weekend poll results, was looking at a near \u00a3500m fall in the value of its stakes in the two banks. In Europe, there was a more mixed performance, with talk that sanctions against Russia could be deferred helping to support the markets and pulling them back from their worst levels. The final scores on the doors showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 20.33 points or 0.3% at 6834.77 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.11% to 9758.03 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.26% lower at 4474.93 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was down 0.47% at 21,294.34 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.42% lower at 11,102.6 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 21 points or 0.13%. As for sterling, it stands at $1.6147, down more than 1% on the day albeit off its worst levels. It fell a similar amount against the euro, falling to \u20ac1.24. On that note it\u2019s time to shut up shop for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we will be back tomorrow. Some of the Scottish-linked companies have come back off their worst levels, notably Royal Bank of Scotland after the announcement of further details of its plan to float its Citizens business in the US. But looking back at the worst levels of the leading companies in the FTSE 100 which have links to Scotland, and would therefore be hit by any yes vote in the independence referendum, there was some \u00a35bn - \u00a34.737bn to be accurate - wiped off their market value before the recovery. Worst, fairly obviously I suppose, were the banks, with RBS down \u00a31.5bn and Lloyds losing \u00a31.85bn. So the UK government, already reeling from the weekend\u2019s polls which showed a yes vote was in the ascendence for the first time, was also looking at a near \u00a31bn reduction in the value of its shares in the two state-controlled banks. Kathleen Brooks, research director at FOREX.com, predicts that the pound could be in for a rough ride, whether the yes campaign are victorious or not. She says: The market\u2019s insecurities and concerns for an independent Scotland means that the pound would be in the firing line if the yes campaign wins, however the pound could also be under pressure if the no vote win, but only by a small margin. Here\u2019s Kathleen\u2019s takeaways: The markets are in panic mode, and starting to contemplate the prospect of a win for the yes vote. Even if the no campaign wins, we expect it to be by a very slim margin. Based on what happened in Quebec in the 1990\u2019s, even a win for the no campaign could have negative repercussions for some Scottish companies and may not be that good for sterling in the medium-term. We think that the outlook for GBP, especially versus the USD, looks bleak over the next 10 days to the referendum. In GBP/USD $1.5722 is key support leading up to 18th Sept. UK stocks are also likely to remain under pressure in the lead up to polling day. The financial sector is particularly under pressure. Even a win for the no campaign could hurt Scottish companies if it triggers capital and deposit flight. On Scotland\u2019s sterlingisation option (see 2.45pm), worth remembering that former Brussels\u2019 economics chief Olli Rehn warned last week that it would be incompatible with EU membership. Despite the late surge in support for the yes campaign, the bookmakers still believe Scotland is more likely to vote no next week. The two sides have narrowed, though, since Sunday\u2019s YouGov opinion poll put the pro-independence side in the lead. Jamie Searle, fixed income specialist at Citi has been answering a question about the implications of an independent Scotland not taking its share of previous UK government debt - something Salmond has threatened in the event Westminster parties do not allow a currency union. Searle says there are future risks for an independent Scotland if it does make such a refusal and \u201cif referendum day turns into default day\u201d. In that case, Scotland\u2019s future funding costs would be affected. He clarifies it would not be a default as such but \u201ccertainly would be taken pretty negatively\u201d by capital markets. And that\u2019s the end of the Citi conference call on Scotland. Highlights start here. Citi\u2019s top economists are now taking questions from investors on the Scottish referendum (conference call highlights start here). My colleague Katie Allen reports: Asked about what happens with Scotland\u2019s currency, economist Michael Saunders replies that so-called \u201csterlingisation\u201d appears the most likely option. In other words, Saunders explains: \u201cthe pound becomes legal tender in Scotland and they would in effect be shadowing sterling... allowing sterling to trade freely in the country.\u201d There are two key problems with this, Saunders says. Firstly, the lack of a lender of last resort, the role performed in the financial system at the moment by the Bank of England. Secondly, there would be \u201cno backstop\u201d for sovereign debt. He points out this set-up has precedents but that it has \u201cnever been used in a country with anything like as large a banking system as Scotland\u201d. \u201cYou would have to have doubts over the longevity of such an arrangement,\u201d Saunders says. Jamie Searle, from Citi\u2019s rates strategy team notes that the gilt markets (where UK government debt is traded) had until recently largely ignored the referendum based on poll suggesting a no vote. Now he says \u201cthe referendum is too close to call\u201d and that the \u201cprobability of a yes vote continues to rise\u201d. Talking about currencies, Valentin Marinov of Citi Global Markets warns that investors should be \u201ccautious\u201d on the pound ahead of the referendum. \u201cThere is clear risk of further downside correction,\u201d he says. That\u2019s on top of today\u2019s selloff which has knocked 1.75 cents off the pound. Michael Saunders, Citi\u2019s head of European Economics, says that the impact of a Scottish Yes vote for UK interest rates is by no means straight-forward. He\u2019s telling investors on today\u2019s conference call that the referendum result would have implications for the Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting committee, the MPC. Saunders notes that the chance of a rate hike after a yes vote in the immediate aftermath of the referendum in October or November, \u201cwould surely be very low\u201d. Beyond that it depends on the Bank\u2019s view over any deterioration in business confidence in the UK and also on any weakness in the pound. The former could delay rate hikes, the latter could bring them forward. The MPC will also have to consider to what extent any post-election fiscal tightening might be deferred as a result of a yes vote. That \u201cmight be a reason to be more hawkish\u201d, adds Saunders. (hawkish = keener to raise rates) Saunders finally moves onto implications for the rest of the UK in the event of a yes vote in Scotland. He notes \u201csizeable implications\u201d on three points: Trade and economy Political position of the rest of the UK without Scotland What the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee would do to deal with the changes Citi\u2019s Michael Saunders is now outlining four key uncertainties for an independent Scotland to investors: Scotland\u2019s relatively weak fiscal position Scotland\u2019s future currency position The position of the banking sector Question of whether an independent Scotland can or will be in the EU. On the first point, he comments that Scotland is highly dependent on oil and that \u201coil revenues are not what they used to be\u201d. My colleague Katie Allen is on a conference call with economists at Citi on \u201cThe Scottish Referendum: Economic and Market Consequences\u201d. She reports that Michael Saunders, head of European economics at Citi, began the call with an overview of polls and how they have changed, noting that \u201cuntil recently the polls showed a done deal\u201d and that it appeared \u201cthe no vote was comfortably ahead\u201d. But \u201cthat has changed in the last week\u201d and the polls now show a \u201cstatistical dead heat\u201d, he says. \u201cFrom here the polls are looking too close to call. This is one that could go either way.\u201d Saunders also notes that momentum appears to \u201cfirmly with the yes vote\u201d and that turnout is likely to be a key deciding factor, with a high turnout suggesting more young people have voted and that in general they are more likely to vote yes to independence. More to follow... Sterling has also fallen sharply against the euro today. The pound is currently down 1.1%, or \u20ac0.135, at \u20ac1.2469. That means one euro is worth 80.15p, up from 79.4p on Friday night. The City is deeply concerned by the uncertainty over what currency an independence Scotland would use, and fears of currency flight if the \u2018yes\u2019 campaign win, says Brenda Kelly of IG. \u201cAlex Salmond has constantly insisted that the newly independent country will continue to use the pound in a currency union. This has been ruled out by Westminster, mainly because it is perceived as unreasonable that taxpayers in Wales and England should support Scotland\u2019s financial sector and public deficit. \u201cThere is an option to simply continue to use sterling without the backing of the Bank of England. Bear in mind that having the central bank available as a lender of last resort is only really pertinent during a significant financial crisis. Mark Carney has pledged to fulfil this role in the transition period. But what would a transition period look like and how long would it actually be expected to last? \u201cThe prospect of exiting the pound could trigger bank runs as savers attempt to protect their deposits. Banks based in Scotland are widely expected to move down south and thus this significant flow of capital leaving Scotland would do no good to the Scottish economy.\u201d The prospect of Scotland voting for independence in 10 days time has provoked a flurry of alarm in the financial markets today. The pound has taken a severe buffeting, to levels not seen since November 2013. It\u2019s down almost two cents against the US dollar at $1.6143, extending last week\u2019s losses as the yes campaign surged in the polls. Oliver Harvey, foreign exchange strategist at Deutsche Bank, says the British public establishment is reacting with \u201crising panic\u201d to Sunday\u2019s YouGov poll. He believes a \u2018yes\u2019 vote on 18 September could derail the UK economic recovery. \u201cOn the currency side, it could at worse lead to a destabilizing crisis in the whole British banking system and at best leave the the rest of the UK with an unstable currency union in which the Bank of England is forced to continue to provide liquidity to Scottish banks while Westminster thrashes out a fiscal and monetary arrangement with a new Scottish sovereign government holding all the cards.\u201d The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has also been hit, led by two Scottish-based banks. Lloyds Banking Group are down by 3.3%, wiping \u00a31.74bn off its value. Royal Bank of Scotland have shed 2.8%, or \u00a31.1bn. Energy firm SSE and Standard Life have both lost \u00a3400m, Babcock is down \u00a3233m, Weir Group down \u00a3100m and Aberdeen Asset Management off by \u00a382m. In total, more than \u00a34bn has been knocked off those seven company\u2019s value. As Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG puts it: Not since 1977 and the infamous Wembley pitch invasion have Scots caused so much carnage to London. Over in Greece, prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s promise of tax cuts and growth this year have failed to wow his critics. Instead of appreciation or even enthusiasm that their worst slump in modern times was about to be consigned to the dustbin of history, Greek unions responded with a large dose of cynicism and disbelief. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s statements are far removed from the reality in which most Greeks are forced to survive,\u201d Odysseus Trivalas, who presides over the Greek civil servants\u2019 union, ADEDY, told the Guardian. \u201cThe reality is that nearly two million are unemployed, 6,500 have taken their own lives, pensions and wages have been cut dramatically, insurance funds are collapsing and people are losing their jobs. These cuts, which wouldn\u2019t even take effect until 2016-1017, bear no connection to any of that.\u201d Instead, Trivalas echoed widespread sentiment that with the ruling conservative party lagging behind Syriza, the radical left main opposition party in polls, Samaras\u2019 nostrums were a political ruse aimed squarely at boosting the government\u2019s standing ahead of possible early elections. The threat of Greece being plunged into renewed political turmoil has mounted as speculation grows that it may well be forced to hold early elections if the ruling coalition, now clinging to power with a majority of two, fails to garner enough votes to replace the country\u2019s outgoing president, Karolos Papoulias, when his term ends next February. Trivalas added: \u201cWe all believe that elections will be early and this is part of blackmailing Greeks into thinking that this government not only offers stability but something even better. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth.\u201d Greece is believed to have wanted to make tax relief a central platform of talks when negotiations were re-launched with its \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF in Paris last week. Lenders preferred, instead, to focus on Athens\u2019 implementations of long overdue structural reforms \u2013 the price of 240 bn euro in emergency bailout loans with all talk of tax breaks being rebuffed. In his enthusiasm to win political capital, Samaras had announced the cuts without even having them approved, Trivalas quipped. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, is going round Europe trying to stir up enthusiasm for a German investment splurge to help the eurozone. The IMF chief has held a series of press interviews , saying that Germany could help its the region by boosting its spending - and also backing calls for structural reforms across the euro area. Reuters has the details: Lagarde told daily Les Echos in an interview the process could be aided by Germany, which is borrowing at record-low rates and on track to record a public sector surplus for the third year running. \u201cWe think that public or private investment (in Germany) to finance infrastructure would be welcome,\u201d she said, stressing this did not mean making the German economy less competitive. Asked in a second interview on Radio Classique whether Germany could do more to spur a European economic recovery, Lagarde told the radio: \u201cIt seems to us at the International Monetary Fund that it (Germany) can go a bit further, that it can do a bit more, in Germany\u2019s interest.\u201d Last week, ECB chief Mario Draghi urged eurozone governments to make structural reforms; seen as a pointed reminder to Paris and Rome to crack on. Lagarde today backed that call, telling Radio Classique that European governments must make themselves more competitive, with more flexible labour markets \u201cI think structural reform is necessary in terms of labour market regulations, excessive regulations in some areas, of areas of economic activity that are too protected and which need to be opened up to competition.This goes for everyone... it\u2019s true for France, it\u2019s true for Germany, it\u2019s true for Italy.\u201d Ireland\u2019s Finance Minister Michael Noonan begins a long week of lobbying across Europe this week. He\u2019s starting today in Brussels where he will ask EU partners if the Republic can pay off its debts to the International Monetary Fund first, before tackling its obligations to Europe. Henry McDonald, Ireland Correspondent, has the details: Noonan and the Fine Gael-Labour coalition believe that if Ireland is allowed to repay the IMF bailout bill first before paying back loans from the European Central Bank it could result in annual savings of \u20ac375m to the Irish Exchequer. His logic is that with Ireland now enjoying low borrowing costs on the international markets -a sign of renewed global investors\u2019 confidence in the Republic - Dublin should be allowed to go first to the private markets to pay off the IMF side of the debt. The IMF debt burden is greater than that Ireland owes to the ECB. The Irish Finance Minister\u2019s marathon round of meetings includes one with Mario Draghi, the ECB\u2019s chief ahead of a meeting of all the EU finance ministers in Milan on Friday. The EU\u2019s response to Noonan\u2019s request will show if the praise European partners have been lavishing on Ireland for accepting austerity (the \u201cposter boys of Europe and all that in contrast with recalcitrant Greeks and Spaniards) was just for the optics. A deal for Noonan is critical too as he charts the October budget which will be crucial in determining the fortunes of the current government with an election less than two years away. The recent surge of money into eurozone government bonds has driven down the yield, or interest rate, on Ireland\u2019s 10-year debt to just 1.65%. That\u2019s much less than the cost of its rescue loans. And Irish two-year bond yields are negative, meaning investors are now paying for the privilege of holding Ireland\u2019s short-term debt. The selloff in sterling has deepened, as Scottish independence jitters reverberate around the financial markets. The pound is down two cents against the US dollar, to $1.6118, cementing its position as the weakest major currency today. That\u2019s a new 10-month low. Fears over the future of its banking sector, its currency options, and how much UK debt an independent Scotland would take on are all pushing sterling down. Alistair Cotton, corporate trader at Currencies Direct, reckons the pound would slump by at least 5% more if Scotland votes \u201cYes\u201d on 18 September. \u201cThe rationale behind Scotland continuing to use the pound is to promote stability and remove uncertainty for trade. Domestically that might be true, but internationally the opposite is happening. Markets don\u2019t like uncertainty. We can expect at least a 5% drop in the pound in the face of Yes vote \u2013 and it could be considerably more. \u201cThe prospect of protected negotiations will create a period of volatility in exchange rates, bonds and equities which will continue until concrete decisions over debt and currency are made. \u201cCapital flight is the main concern for an independent Scotland, as financial firms will want the safe harbour the Bank of England provides. We can expect large financial firms to all move headquarters to England. Whatever decision Scotland makes on 18 September we can expect to see short to medium-term pain across the British Isles.\u201d This is worrying. Economic confidence in the eurozone has fallen sharply, as the European Central Bank\u2019s efforts to stimulate growth and inflation fail to calm the region. The Sentix research group reported that morale among investors slumped this month, to -9.8 on its index. That\u2019s the lowest reading since July 2013, and a big drop on August\u2019s 2.7. Sentix said the collapse came \u201cdespite new measures taken by the European Central Bank\u201d, which announced a QE-style asset purchase scheme last week. The current situation measure, and investors\u2019 6-month expectations, both fell into negative territory, the group said, adding: That\u2019s remarkable because ever since President (Mario) Draghi took office, the ECB has always managed to boost investors\u2019 economic expectations with a variety of measures. This doesn\u2019t seem to be working anymore.\u201d The indicator points to another recession in the euro zone,\u201d it added. The report is online here. The oil price has just slipped to its lowest level in 14 months. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude is changing hands for $99.96 per barrel, the first time below the $100 mark since June 2013. An unexpected fall in Chinese imports (data released overnight) is one factor, as is the pound\u2019s weakness against the US dollar (as oil is priced in dollars, even if it\u2019s sourced from the North Sea) British banks have been warned against dodging the EU\u2019s bank bonus cap. Michel Barnier, a vice-president of the European commission, has threatened the City with a \u201ca co-ordinated policy response\u201d, if they circumvent rules banning staff from bonuses worth more than 100% of base salary, or 200% with shareholders\u2019 permission. More here: EU moves to crackdown on banks dodging bonus cap While Britain\u2019s housing boom slows, Spain\u2019s long property slump may be over. House prices in Spain rose by 0.8% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2014, the first annual rise since the financial crisis began six years ago. The National Statistics Institute reported that the prices of newly built houses led the way, up 1.9%, while \u201csecond-hand\u201d houses rose 0.2%, the highest increase since the fourth quarter of 2007. Spain\u2019s housing market boomed during the early days of the eurozone, fuelled by easy credit flowing to the periphery. Its implosion left its banks nursing huge losses, forcing Spain to take rescue funds from the EU. More here (pdf) The pound\u2019s 1% tumble against the US dollar makes it the worst performing major currency today. fastFT adds: If one includes exotic, tiny currencies then only the Afghan afghani, Sierra Leone\u2019s leone, the Tongan pa\u2019aanga, the Vanuatu vatu and the Malawi kwacha have done worse than sterling today, according to Bloomberg data. Here\u2019s another sign that Britain\u2019s housing market may be easing: more than half of the most expensive houses put up for sale in London recently have been withdrawn, due to weak demand. The Financial Times reports: Tax rises on high-value properties, along with the prospect of a \u201cmansion tax\u201d and the uncertainty caused by a looming general election, have made homes that are worth more than \u00a32m much harder to sell, according to research for the Financial Times. More than half of all properties in London\u2019s most expensive central areas have been withdrawn unsold in the six months to the end of June, the research by the property data company Lonres and analysts Dataloft shows. One last word on Scotland... this chart, from Neville Hill of Credit Suisse, shows how the City\u2019s fears over independence are interlinked. Sterling continues to be hit hard by the prospect of Scotland voting for independence, falling to a four-month low against a basket of currencies. As this chart shows, the pound remains at a 10-month low against the US dollar at $1.6175. My colleague Ben Quinn is tracking all the Scottish Independence news here: Scottish independence: 10 days to referendum - Live The surge of support for Scottish independence has sent jitters through the stock market this morning. Shares in companies with large Scottish interest suffered sharp falls in early trading, my colleague Fiona Walsh reports: Royal Bank of Scotland was the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, falling more than 3% in early trading. Energy group SSE (Scottish &amp; Southern Electricity) were down 2.5%, Lloyds Banking Group dropped 2.2%, Standard Life were down 2% and Aberdeen Asset Management fell 1.5%. The FTSE 100, which last week reached a 14 year high, was down 18 points, at 6837. Halifax also flags up that Britain is (not before time) building more homes. Although probably not at a fast enough rate to tackle the demand shortages. The number of new homes built in April-June was 7% higher than in the same period last year, it reports. A continuation of this upward trend in housebuilding could also help to bring demand and supply into better balance. And home sales remain \u201cbroadly stable so far this year\u201d, at between 101,000 and 104,000 a month (apart from February which hit 109,500). A survey released last week, though, found that construction firms were struggling to lay their hands on skilled workers and raw materials.... Despite August\u2019s slowdown, house prices are still up by 3.0% over the last quarter, according to Halifax\u2019s survey. Halifax\u2019s monthly data can be a little erratic, but Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight reckons a slowdown is underway: The Halifax data tie in with our view that house prices will keep on clearly rising overall through the coming months, but at a more restrained rate. After a strong run, Britain\u2019s housing market took a breather last month with prices barely rising. Halifax\u2019s monthly survey of the sector found that prices inched up by just 0.1% in August, sharply down on the 1.2% recorded in July. On an annual basis, prices are up 9.7% compared to August 2013, down from the rollicking 10.2% surge recorded the previous month. Recent affordability tests, and the prospect of the Bank of England raising interest rates soon, may be weighing on the market, leading to a summer lull. Weak wage growth, with pay packets failing to match inflation, may also be hurting demand for houses. As Martin Ellis, Halifax\u2019s housing economist, puts it: Earnings growth that remains below consumer price inflation, and the prospect of an interest rate rise at some point over the coming months, are likely to curb demand. Ellis also suggests that more second-hand houses are coming on to the market, which could make some impact on Britain\u2019s chronic supply shortages. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and business. Coming up today..... a new house price survey from the Halifax building society will show whether Britain\u2019s housing boom is running out of steam. Sterling is taking a pounding this morning after the Yes campaign took the lead in the Scottish independence campaign, just 10 days before the vote. The pound has tumbled by 1.5 cents against the US dollar to its lowest level since November, as I\u2019ve written up here: Pound slumps to 10-month low after Scottish yes campaign takes poll lead In the corporate world we\u2019ll be looking at the latest results from Associated British Foods - the firm behind Primark. And Sweden\u2019s Electrolux has just announced a $3.3bn deal to buy General Electric\u2019s appliances business. In the eurozone, we\u2019ll be digesting Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s pledge of tax cuts this year, as Greece\u2019s long slump comes to an end. While Germany has reported strong trade data, suggesting that its economy is picking up (more on this shortly) And the long-running battle between Chancellor George Osborne and the EU over capping bankers\u2019 bonuses will come to a head today at the European Court of Justice.",

But just how important it has become is surprising.</p> <p>Back at the start of this century the Chinese economy was around 11% the size of the US; now it is nearly 60% the size of the US. But despite that massive growth, it wasn\u2019t until 2007 that China became more important than the US to world economic growth.</p> <p>Before 2007, the US was easily the biggest contributor to the growth of the world\u2019s economy. <em> <br></em>In 2004, for example, the world economy grew by 12.8% (nominal terms) to which the US contributed two percentage points. By way of context, the UK and Japan that year contributed 0.9 percentage points, France 0.7 and Germany 0.8. China also contributed 0.8 percentage points.</p> <p>In 2007, the world\u2019s GDP grew by a similar 12.7%, but this time China was the biggest contributor with 1.6 percentage points worth, and the US contributing just 1.2. And since then, China has remained the biggest driver of the world\u2019s economic growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/I4kZt/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"500\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>To put it in even more stark terms, from 2007 to 2013, the world\u2019s economy grew by 31% and China contributed nearly a third of that, with 10.1 percentage points worth.<br></p> <p>Plucky little Australia with 1 percentage point chipped in for 3.2% of the world\u2019s growth in the period \u2013 not bad given that we only account for around 2% of the size of world\u2019s economy:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/BYZ5a/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"500\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So clearly, China is important, and not just to Australia. Indeed, the RBA governor, Glenn Stevens, last week<a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2014/sp-gov-030914.html\"> noted</a> that China is the first or second biggest trading partner for \u201cnearly 50 economies, including the United States, European Union, Japan, Russia and Canada\u201d.</p> <p>So it is not surprising that economists around the world are looking anxiously towards Beijing for signs of either economic health or concern.

      "bodyText": "After a decade of riding on the back of China with little concern about falling off, recent data has many economists worried that the ride is about to get much bumpier. It\u2019s perhaps not surprising that China is important not just to Australia\u2019s economy, but the whole world\u2019s. But just how important it has become is surprising. Back at the start of this century the Chinese economy was around 11% the size of the US; now it is nearly 60% the size of the US. But despite that massive growth, it wasn\u2019t until 2007 that China became more important than the US to world economic growth. Before 2007, the US was easily the biggest contributor to the growth of the world\u2019s economy. In 2004, for example, the world economy grew by 12.8% (nominal terms) to which the US contributed two percentage points. By way of context, the UK and Japan that year contributed 0.9 percentage points, France 0.7 and Germany 0.8. China also contributed 0.8 percentage points. In 2007, the world\u2019s GDP grew by a similar 12.7%, but this time China was the biggest contributor with 1.6 percentage points worth, and the US contributing just 1.2. And since then, China has remained the biggest driver of the world\u2019s economic growth: To put it in even more stark terms, from 2007 to 2013, the world\u2019s economy grew by 31% and China contributed nearly a third of that, with 10.1 percentage points worth. Plucky little Australia with 1 percentage point chipped in for 3.2% of the world\u2019s growth in the period \u2013 not bad given that we only account for around 2% of the size of world\u2019s economy: So clearly, China is important, and not just to Australia. Indeed, the RBA governor, Glenn Stevens, last week noted that China is the first or second biggest trading partner for \u201cnearly 50 economies, including the United States, European Union, Japan, Russia and Canada\u201d. So it is not surprising that economists around the world are looking anxiously towards Beijing for signs of either economic health or concern. And recently, signs of concern are more prevalent. Firstly, we need some context \u2013 no one expects China to grow at the speed it did from 2002 to 2010: The Chinese government doesn\u2019t even want growth that fast; instead it wants a more steady, and hopefully sustainable growth of around 7.5% rather than the 10% plus annual growth it averaged from 2002 to 2010. But the concern is whether or not China can achieve even this level of growth, or whether a fall is about to occur. Among the signs we can look at that have the biggest impact on Australia are Chinese manufacturing and construction \u2013 the better they are performing the more they will demand all that metal we have lying under our ground. The latest Chinese manufacturing purchasing managers index has been good, if not spectacular. The latest measure came in at 51.1, a slight fall from the previous month\u2019s 51.7. A score above 50 means manufacturing is generally expanding; below means it is contracting: Similarly, China\u2019s annual growth of industrial output, while well below pre-GFC growth of over 14%, is steady at around 9%: So where does the concern come from? Housing. In the past few months there have been a number of worrying signs that the booming Chinese real estate market is about to burst. For example, the Wall Street Journal recently reported a Chinese study that found in 2013 22.4% of houses in China\u2019s urban areas were vacant \u2013 up from 20.6% in 2011. This suggests a fairly serious glut of houses in China. And when there is an over-supply of something, the price for that item inevitably falls. In July, monthly residential house prices rose in only six of the 70 major Chinese cities. If we look at the growth of residential housing prices across five of the major Chinese cities, the drop off in prices is clear to see: The decline has also occurred in commercial buildings, with the growth of sales in commercial buildings for the first seven months of this year 8.4% below what was achieved last year: Similarly, the growth rate of investment in real estate development has dropped off. This time last year it was growing at around 19% year on year; now it is down to 13.7%. For Australia, the real impact of this is in the price of our exports \u2013 especially iron ore. If you aren\u2019t building as many buildings as you used to, you don\u2019t need as much steel. The problem, of course, is that on the back of a decade of mining investment, we now have a large supply of iron ore to export. And when there is a large increase in supply of a good without a similar large increase in demand, the price of that good falls \u2013 and that is exactly what has happened to iron ore prices: Since January 2013 iron ore prices have fallen 43% in US dollars, and 48% in Australian dollars. Since just December last year, the price has fallen 37% from US$135 a tonne to US$85.70 a tonne \u2013 the lowest since September 2009. This has a number of effects. Firstly it makes it tougher for our mining companies to make a profit. Analysts suggest that for BHP to break even they need a price of US$51 a tonne. And it has been reported that they are about to increase exports from 225 million tonnes to 290mt. But while they\u2019ll continue to make a profit, it\u2019s worth noting that if the price of iron ore is at the December price of US$135 a tonne exporting 225mt would make BHP roughly $18.9bn in profit; but if they exported 290mt at $US85 a tonne, they\u2019re looking like only making a profit of around $9.86bn.
