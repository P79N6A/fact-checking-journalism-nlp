Those are some of the findings in a report out on Thursday from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development that urges an overhaul of core values and behaviour in the City if financial institutions are to restore trust. Its survey finds a significant number of workers are embarrassed to admit they work in financial services, echoing recent comments from Lloyds Banking Group boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio who said the \"best and the brightest\" students are being put off a career in banking because of the stigma attached to the industry.

      "bodyText": "London could be stripped of the regulation of key benchmarks such as Libor and Paris handed the authority to oversee similar controversial yet crucial pricing systems, under proposals circulating in Brussels. The pan-European securities regulator based in Paris would also take control of benchmark pricing of commodities and energy, which is already being investigated by regulators in London. After the Libor rate-rigging scandal was exposed a year ago, with a \u00a3290m fine for Barclays, the new Financial Conduct Authority in London took over regulation of the benchmark lending rate, which is used to price \u00a3190tn of contracts around the world. Until then it had been an unregulated market, with Libor \u2013 the London interbank offered rate \u2013 managed by trade body the British Bankers' Association. But a draft of the regulation being drawn up in Brussels proposes giving the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) direct regulation of Libor and other benchmarks, which have been the subject of scrutiny since the interest rate-rigging scandal was exposed. According to the draft of the consultation paper, which is not due to be published for another two months, the other key interest-rate benchmark that has been rigged \u2013 Euribor \u2013 would also be regulated in Paris. According to a draft seen by the Financial Times, regulation should be moved to ESMA because the benchmarks have an impact in more than one member state. \"Certain critical inter-bank interest-rate benchmarks may have effects in and involve contributors, administrators and users in more than one member state, meaning that the supervision of such a benchmark by the competent national authority of the member state where it is located will not be efficient and effective in terms of addressing the risks,\" according to the draft. The UK is likely to fight the proposals, particularly over commodities and energy benchmarks, which are managed by price-reporting agencies. The European commission last month raided the offices of oil companies in an investigation into claims they may have \"colluded in reporting distorted prices to a price-reporting agency [PRA] to manipulate the published prices for a number of oil and biofuel products\".",

In an assessment of the rescue conducted jointly with the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European commission, the IMF said it had been forced to override its normal rules for providing financial assistance in order to put money into Greece. Fund officials had severe doubts about whether Greece's debt would be sustainable even after the first bailout was provided in May 2010 and only agreed to the plan because of fears of contagion. While it succeeded in keeping Greece in the eurozone, the report admitted the bailout included notable failures. \"Market confidence was not restored, the banking system lost 30% of its deposits and the economy encountered a much deeper than expected recession with exceptionally high unemployment.\" In Athens, officials reacted with barely disguised glee to the report, saying it confirmed that the price exacted for the \u20ac110bn (\u00a393bn) emergency package was too high for a country beset by massive debts, tax evasion and a large black economy.\" Under the weight of such measures \u2013 applied across the board and hitting the poorest hardest \u2013 the economy, they said, was always bound to dive into an economic death spiral. \"For too long they [troika officials] refused to accept that the programme was simply off-target by hiding behind our failure to implement structural reforms,\" said one insider. \"Now that reforms are being applied they've had to accept the bitter truth.\" The IMF said: \"The Fund approved an exceptionally large loan to Greece under an stand-by agreement in May 2010 despite having considerable misgivings about Greece's debt sustainability.

      "bodyText": "Debate over the IMF report into Greece will rage into Thursday. So I'll be back with another liveblog in a few hours :) Until tomorrow morning, goodnight all, and thanks for reading and for the comments. GW Here are a few mea culpas from the final section of the IMF report (p49 and 50), to ponder... 1) With regard to Fund involvement, the view expressed was that it would have been better if the crisis could have been resolved within the EU/euro zone, but neither the authorities nor the EC or ECB had the required program experience. The Fund\u2019s experience in crisis resolution made it a necessary part of the process. Translation: We'd rather have not been there at all. But they'd have done an even worse job without us. 2) Later, the possibility of Greece exiting the euro became a public debate by the euro partners, a discussion that should have occurred behind closed doors. Translation: why in God's name wouldn't they shut up about Grexit? 3) The common view was that no-one could have predicted the depth and length of the recession. However, officials acknowledged that the program\u2019s macroeconomic projections had risks to the downside that materialized in a context of political instability and deposit outflows. Also, in calculating the effects of tax measures, price and income elasticities were underestimated and this reduced the revenue yield Translation: Perhaps we should have known how bad things would be. But again, who knew better?... 4) With hindsight, greater effort should also have been made at the beginning of the program to privatize state assets and to clamp down on prominent tax evaders. Translation: Greater effort could STILL be made to privative state assets and clamp down on prominent tax evaders 5) Consensus on the program has now improved with the coalition government. However, the crisis and the recession have had terrible consequences for Greece in terms of unemployment and have caused severe stress in society with extreme parties now gaining support. Translation: Looks like we've helped to fuel support for a neo-nazi party. That wasn't in the programme. Some more reaction to the report: And this graph from the report shows how Greek wages dropped under the programme, as unemployment soared: Another criticism of the bailout, is that the burden of adjustment \"was not shared evenly across society\". In the public sector, while wages and bonuses were cut, \"specific plans to downsize the number of civil servants were limited to a commitment to replace only 20 percent of those who retired.\" The state enterprises also remained generously staffed, the report states. Over in the private sector, the Troika had expected wage negotiations to push down labour costs. But this didn't happen: The private sector sustained enormous job losses partly because wage setting mechanisms were not liberalized. And the report also cites Greece's failure to clamp down harder on tax evasion by high income earners: While the program recognized that it would take time to show results from improved tax administration, the absence of quick progress in collecting evaded taxes came at the cost of any demonstrable improvement in the equity of the tax burden. On page 28 of the report (pdf), the IMF bluntly admits that the 2010 bailout was a \"holding operation\", and taxpapers paid the price. Rather than just lending Athens \u20ac110bn, it would have been better to have imposed haircuts on borrowers then, in 2010. However, political opposition made it impossible, and gave private bondholders the time to shift out of Greek debt: As the iMF admits: Not tackling the public debt problem decisively at the outset or early in the program created uncertainty about the euro area\u2019s capacity to resolve the crisis and likely aggravated the contraction in output. An upfront debt restructuring would have been better for Greece although this was not acceptable to the euro partners. A delayed debt restructuring also provided a window for private creditors to reduce exposures and shift debt into official hands. As seen earlier, this shift occurred on a significant scale and limited the bail-in of creditors when PSI* eventually took place, leaving taxpayers and the official sector on the hook. * PSI = private sector involvment of 2011, when corporate creditors agreed to cut the Greek debt mountain by \u20ac200bn. Here's some early reaction to the IMF report tonight from City experts, financial journalists and eurocrisis watchers: The IMF has also released its latest assessment of Greece -- and warned that European countries made need to make further debt write-offs to keep the Greek debt programme on track: Here's the key paragraph (full statement here) Directors expressed concern that public debt is projected to remain high well into the next decade and concurred with the assessment that macroeconomic risks are on the downside. In this context, Directors welcomed the assurances from Greece\u2019s European partners that they will consider further measures and assistance, if necessary, to reduce debt to substantially below 110% of GDP by 2022, conditional on Greece\u2019s full implementation of all commitments contained in the program. Speaking on tonight's conference call, Poul Thomsen said he hoped that this commitment would encourage private investors to buy Greek debt. But if they get nervous, a more 'front-loaded' appoach may be needed..... You can read the full 50-page report yourself -- EX POST EVALUATION OF EXCEPTIONAL ACCESS UNDER THE 2010 STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT (pdf). The report includes a handy reminder of the last three and a half years, using the backdrop of Greece's borrowing costs: Thomsen also denied that the reports says the Troika (the IMF-EU-ECB) did a bad job. The report does not say that the Troika did not function well, it says it functioned very well...but clearly there could have been a better division of labour. Thomsen added that the Troika functioned \"surprisingly well\" given it was made up of three different bodies, although clearly there's always room for improvement.... So let's check the report..... And the final paragraph explains how the troika struggled to 'gel' and work in a 'co-ordinated' fashion: The Troika reflects three different institutions. This sometimes posed coordination problems: the Fund made decisions in a structured fashion, while decision-making in the Euro Zone spanned Heads of State and multiple agencies and was more fragmented.Officials observed that it took time for the Troika to gel as a unit, for example, in formulating a common macro view, but in general, dealing with the Troika was fairly smooth. The Troika partners listened to each other and were well-prepared. However, detailed conditionality increased the coordination challenge. There was also sometimes a lack of continuity in the Troika teams. All-in-all, this exacerbated uncertainty and reduced the possibility for early agreements. So, the Troika did its best, but struggled \u2013 and the dysfunctionality in the eurozone didn't help. That won't shock experienced watchers of the crisis either. Speculation over Greece's possible exit from the eurozone hampered the bailout, Poul Thomsen of the International Monetary Fund told reporters on the press conference. Thomsen pinned some of the blame on those in Europe who talked about Grexit risks, saying they had helped to drive its economy down. This added to the impact of its austerity programme. Poul Thomsen, the IMF's mission chief to Greece, is speaking on a conference call now. Asked whether the IMF had made mistakes, Thomsen pointed to the 'multiplier' -- the number used when calculating the impact that spending cuts have on growth (and which clearly didn't work with Greece). Themson said that the IMF had used calculations from the OECD, but now recognises that a larger multiplier is needed: Certainly, there are things that we could have done differently. If we did it again, we wouldn't use the same multiplier. Breaking: the IMF report is out, and it admits that the Washington-based fund made a series of 'notable' errors over Greece's first bailout in 2010, including overestimating the impact of austerity. The 50-page document admits that the programme created a much deeper recession than expected, driving unemployment higher than the Fund had forecast. However, it argues that the bailout package was necessary and did achieve two key targets -- keeping Greece in the eurozone, and avoiding wider contagion. The report cited several \"notable failures\" -- the long recession, the panic caused in the financial markets, and damage to Greece's banking sector as savers withdrew this money: Market confidence was not restored, the banking system lost 30 percent of its deposits, and the economy encountered a much- deeper-than-expected recession with exceptionally high unemployment. Public debt remained too high and eventually had to be restructured, with collateral damage for bank balance sheets that were also weakened by the recession. Competitiveness improved somewhat on the back of falling wages, but structural reforms stalled and productivity gains proved elusive. The report reveals that IMF officials changed their criterion, to ensure that Greece passed its rules for \"debt sustainability\". Subsequently, Greece's fast-shrinking economy missed the macro-economic targets. The Fund's report is also critical of the way the Greek programme was handled, saying \"depth of ownership of the program and the capacity to implement structural reforms were overestimated\". It also admits that it struggled to cope with a bailout programme within a currency union: A particular challenge is to find ways to translate promises of conditional assistance from partner countries into formal program agreements. And finally, the Fund pointed to political challenges -- and implied that the Greek government hasn't played straight with the IMF during bailout talks. It said: Greece\u2019s recent experience demonstrates the importance of spreading the burden of adjustment across different strata of society in order to build support for a program. The obstacles encountered in implementing reforms also illustrate the critical importance of ownership of a program, a lesson that is common to the findings of many previous EPEs. Other lessons drawn concern the need to find ways to streamline the Troika process in the future and for Fund staff to be more skeptical about official data during regular surveillance. The IMF is holding a conference call now... I'll post some highlights shortly, along with more details of the report.... Still expecting the IMF report to be released this evening \u2013 perhaps quite soon.... 9pm BST in fact The IMF started the process of admitting errors over Greece a few months ago, when its economics staff revealed that it may have underestimated the impact of austerity. The FT writes, though, that this new report goes further: Although the IMF has made such arguments in public recently \u2013 saying that it may have underestimated the \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d that tough austerity measures have on economic growth \u2013 the report says that Greece was a particularly problematic case because of the government\u2019s administrative weaknesses. While the Daily Telegraph points out that the report could have implications for the way other bailout packages are handled in future. The IMF report is scathing about the so-called \u201ctroika\u201d, a body that was created when the fund joined forces with the European Commission and the European Central Bank to run the first \u20ac110bn Greek bailout in 2010. The indictment of the \u201ctroika\u201d will have wider resonance because as well as administering Greece it oversees the economies of the other bailed-out eurozone countries - Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus. As regular eurozone watchers will know, the original \u20ac110bn bailout for Greece in 2010 was followed by another a year later, which included a massive debt writedown by the private sector. That writeoff is the largest sovereign default ever. Officials insist that a repeat will not be allowed for other eurozone nations (in Cyprus, of couse, large bank depositors were 'bailed in' instead). In Athens, government officials reacted with barely disguised glee to the news that the International Monetary Fund made mistakes in its first bailout, three years. ago. Insiders say that the report is particularly critical of the European Union, and also confirms what Greeks have long suspected -- that its first bailout was a major blunder. In Athens, Helena Smith has been speaking to officials, and reports: The report confirms what Greek officials have long said: that the first bailout of uncompromising budget cuts and tax increases, the price of \u20ac110bn in emergency funds in May 2010, was the wrong prescription for a country not only batting a monumental debt load but rampant tax evasion and a flourishing black economy. Under the weight of such measures \u2013 applied across the board and hitting the poorest hardest \u2013 the economy, they said, was always bound to dive into an economic death spiral. \u201cFor too long they [troika officials] refused to accept that the programme was simply off-target by hiding behind our failure to implement structural reforms,\u201d said one insider. \u201cNow that reforms are being applied they\u2019ve had to accept the bitter truth.\u201d The Greek media recently quoted IMF managing director Christine Lagarde describing 2011 as a \u201clost year\u201d partly because of miscalculations by the EU and IMF. The authoritative Kathimerini newspaper said the new report identified a number of \u201cmistakes\u201d including the failure of creditors to agree to a restructuring of Greece\u2019s debt burden earlier \u2013 a failure that had had a disastrous effect on its macro-economic assumptions. One well-placed official at the Greek finance ministry told Helena: From what we understand the IMF singles out the EU for criticism in its handling of the problem more than anything else. But acknowledgement of these mistakes will help us. It has already helped cut some slack and it will help us get what we really need which is a haircut on our debt next year. An IMF spokeswoman said has confirmed that the Fund plans to publish \"a number of papers on Greece later today\". She added: The board met last Friday to discuss several documents on Greece including the review of its programme and its annual economic assessment. The news of the IMF's mea culpa over Greece hit the wires as Europe's stock markets finished a bad day with heavy losses. The FTSE 100 lost over 2%, or 139 points with all-but three shares losing ground. The selloff was triggered by renewed fears that America will start unwinding its stimulus package this summer, and the hefty selloff in Japan early this morning (when the Nikkei slid almost 4%). The futures market suggests a similar slide tomorrow, which would put the index into 'bear market' territory. There's a full market report here, by my colleague Nick Fletcher. Over on Wall Street, the Dow Jones has dropped below the 15,000 mark for the first time in a month. The International Monetary Fund is poised to admit making mistakes in its handling of the first Greek bailout in 2010, according to an exclusive running on the Wall Street Journal. The report (online here), claims that an internal IMF document will admit that it underestimated the impact of the country's austerity programme, and also that rules were bent to keep Greece within the programme. The document, which we're hearing could be published tonight, also claims that serious mistakes were made by officials. Here's a flavour of the WSJ's story: In an internal document marked \"strictly confidential,\" the IMF said it badly underestimated the damage that its prescriptions of austerity would do to Greece's economy, which has been mired in recession for years. But the fund also stressed that the response to the crisis, coordinated with the European Union, bought time to limit the fallout for the rest of the 17-nation euro area. The IMF said that it bent its own rules to make Greece's burgeoning debt seem sustainable and that, in retrospect, the country failed on three of the four IMF criteria to qualify for assistance. Full story here: IMF to Admit Mistakes on Greece Bailout And here's more highlights from the WSJ's Matina Stevis, who broke the story: More news from Greece where officials are devising a new strategy to boost a sector that is vital to regenerating the economy. Helena Smith reports that the initiative has been sparked by record numbers of tourist arrivals this year. It\u2019s official: tourism, Greece\u2019s biggest industry after shipping, is experiencing a renaissance. For the first time since the outbreak of the crisis, figures show the country being braced for a bumper year with some 17 million visitors due to fly in. In Athens, alone, industry figures are reporting a 10 percent increase \u2013 a huge boost for a capital that barely a year ago was associated solely with street riots and strikes. \u201cIt is going to be a bumper year,\u201d said Andreas Andreadis, who heads the Association of Hellenic Tourism Enterprises (SETE). \u201cThe crisis has made Greek enterprises, everyone, much more aware. Greek society understands that tourism can help the country get out of the crisis, by first of all creating jobs,\u201d he told me. Tourism, which contributed around \u20ac32bn to economic output in 2012, accounts for almost 17% of GDP. Roughly 780,000 people are employed in the sector. Andreadis, who has been widely credited with innovatively bumping up the private sector\u2019s role in marketing the country \u2013 previously promoted by lacklustre state bodies \u2013 wants to transform Greece into one of the ten best quality destinations worldwide. To that end, Greece must think outside the box by turning away from the mass market, where deteriorating competiveness has lessened its appeal, and tapping larger, long-haul emerging source markets such as the US, China and Russia. Moves are already afoot. Thanks to a lifting of visa restrictions \u201c13,000 visas in Russia are being issued for Greece every day,\u201d he said. \u201cThe volume is so high that SETE has employed 20 of its own people just to help stamp visas.\u201d Russian arrivals at regional airports, as a result, have already shot up by 230%. The increase in arrivals is vital to helping austerity-hit Greeks, now blighted by the worst unemployment rate in the euro zone, survive the next year. Last year, the 15.5 million tourists who visited Greece spent 650 euro on average. This year, the hope is that 17 million will spend an average \u20ac670. By 2021, Andreadis says, the aim is to attract 24 million tourists who will spend an average \u20ac800 \u2013 \u20ac50bn in total \u2013 thus ensuring jobs for around one million people. \u201cBetter quality will be central to generating that demand,\u201d he said adding that a new PR and branding strategy, focusing on luxury tourism, would also be vital to turning tourism \u2013 and the economy \u2013 around. Speaking of bear markets.... This graph shows how the RTS Index has slid this year: Various gobbets of economic news from the US this afternoon. 1) 135,000 private jobs were created in America last month, a slight increase on April's reading but lower than expected. Economists said it was consistent with only slow employment growth (see graph above - more from Marketwatch here). 2) The US service sector grew faster last month, with its ISM non-manufacturing index rising to 53.7 in May, from 53.1 in April. However, the employment index component of the measure dropped. Paul Dales of Capital Economics said the IMS reading was a \"relief\", but warned that when Monday's weak manufacturing data is included the US economy is probably slowing. 3) US factory orders rose by 1% in April, reversing March's 4.7% fall. Following all this, shares are down across Europe's financial markets this afternoon after Wall Street opened in the red. The FTSE 100 is down 118 points, or 1.8%, at 6439, with the Dow Jones off 72 points (-0.5%). As my colleague Nick Fletcher writes here, markets were already weak on a growing number of comments from US Federal Reserve members that its bond buying programme - a key support for share prices - might gradually come to an end. The 3.8% drop on the Nikkei overnight also caused alarm - much lower and it will be an official bear market. Meanwhile over in Athens our correspondent Helena Smith reports there has been a lively protest by disabled Greeks against austerity measures outside the prime minister\u2019s office. She writes: Hundreds of blind Greeks shouted furiously against the stinging effects of austerity in a demonstration deliberately held to coincide with the arrival of auditors from Greece's troika of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF. Standing behind a row of police vans and policemen despatched to keep them at bay from prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 office, the protestors urged the coalition government to \u201cstick to its commitments\u201d and press for the survival of disability benefits in talks with the officials. Many held protest sheets printed in braille against a backdrop of a huge banner deploring the \u201c200bn euro that has been given to banks.\u201d \u201cDisabled people in this country have paid a very high price for the crisis,\u201d said Giorgos Mitropoulos, vice president of Greece\u2019s association for the blind, a mega-phone in one hand. \u201cWe have suffered cuts that no one in our situation should suffer. I hope the prime minister listens.\u201d Latvia's entry to the euro club comes four years since it took a \u20ac7.5bn bailout from the IMF and the EU. The financial crisis of 2008 burst a credit bubble that had swelled over several years, triggering a real estate crash and anti-government riots in the country, and the resignation of the prime minister. A new government installed in 2009 imposed tough spending cuts and wage reductions, helped to drive Latvia into a deep recession, with the jobless rate rising towards 20%. The economy is now growing strongly again (as the EC was keen to point to this morning). Latvia's GDP increased by 1.2% in the first three months of 2013, defying the 0.2% contraction across the eurozone. The economy is 5.6% larger than a year ago. But the country, of around 2.2m people, still suffers high poverty levels and income inequality. According to the Baltic Centre for Economic Policy Studies, over 30% of the population is classified as \u201cseverely materially deprived,\u201d in 2010. That means they can't afford to pay rent, food bills or utility costs. This is the worst figure in the EU. And as the Toronto Star reported in March, there is a yawning gap between rich and poor in Latvia. Especially outside Riga, the capital city: Take a trip east out of Riga and you will see the faces of austerity. Small cottages and worn farmhouses poke through the deep snow. They form hamlets or villages named Pededze, Aluksne, Liepna and Kuprava. Everyone seems to be out of work. Wood stoves are used for heat \u2014 wood is free and abundant. Most houses have chickens and a couple cows to supplement paltry monthly government assistance cheques of about 35 lats. Almost all of the young people have fled \u2014 to Italy, Germany or Spain. In Kuprava, about 10 minutes from the Russian border, , the official unemployment rate is 20 per cent. But even municipal officers in the town of 800 admit the real figure is much higher. More here: In Latvia, a tough-love economy leaves losers behind Over in Riga, the Latvian prime minister has welcomed being given the go-ahead to adopt the euro from next January. PM Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference that the country could look forward to more rapid economic growth inside the euro area. Dombrovskis said: Joining the euro zone will foster Latvia's economic growth, for sure. He predicted that more foreign investment would flow into the country, and that sovereign credit rating agencies could upgrade Latvia once it joins the euro area. An important question for Olli Rehn at the Brussels press conference: Given Latvia's banking sector has a high reliance on foreign savers, particularly from CIS countries (the former Soviet Republics), are we risking a repeat of Cyprus? Rehn says this is a pertinent issue, but denies that the two countries are comparable. Latvia's total financial sector is much smaller. In Cyprus, the relative size of the banking sector was 800% of GDP, while in Latvia it is below 150% of GDP. On average, the eurozone's financial sector was 356% of GDP in 2011, he adds. Rehn added that Latvia has a long tradition of servicing non-domestic banking clients, mainly corporate from CIS countries. And that does pose \"additional challenges\", due to the cross-border nature of these dealings, he adds.... (as flagged up earlier, analysts believe as much as half of Latvia's deposits come from outside the country) Finally, Rehn talks about the progress made by the Baltic states - remembering that he first visited Latvia 30 years ago. The area has made strong progress since, to reach the heart of Europe, he says. Rehn adds that Latvia will become a fully signed-up member of Europe's new banking supervision and bank resulutions regulations. and repeats that the decision to join the euro is \"a strong signal\" to the euro area, the financial markets, and the world at large. It underlines the strength of the euro...and that economic rewards play off. Latvia's decision to join the eurozone is also a vote of confidence in the single currency, Olli Rehn says. Those who thought the single currency would break up were 'behind the curve and wrong', he declares. Olli Rehn is speaking in Brussels now. After giving his \"best greetings to journalists in Riga\", he confirms that Latvia is ready to adopt the euro from January next year. He says Latvia has achieved a high degree of convergence with the eurozone (see 11.31am for details). Latvia shows that a country can overcome macroeconomic challenges and emerge stronger, he says, talking about the tough fiscal cuts implemented since the financilal crisis started Latvia is on track to be the fastest-growing country in the EU this year, he says. The European Commission has confirmed in the last few moments that Latvia can join the euro from January 2014, becoming the 18th member of the currency union. That's despite the concerns over high levels of foreign savings in its banking sector (see 11.31am). In a statement, the EC said: The Commission considers that Latvia fulfills the conditions for the adoption of the euro. Member states will sign the decision off, on July 9. Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for monetary union, will discuss the issue shortly (there'll be a live feed here). Over in Brussels, the EC has criticised China's threat to impose new duties on European wine (see 11.11am). A spokesman denied that unfairly subsidised crates of the stuff are being sold at bargain prices to Chinese consumers: And confirmation that France could bear the brunt of Beijing's anger, having actually supported imposing levies on Chinese solar panel makers: Breaking: Latvia is to become the 18th member of the eurozone after the European Central Bank gave its blessing, despite concerns over high levels of foreign deposits in its banking sector. An official statement is expected from the Commission shortly. In a statement (online here), the ECB said that Latvia meets its convergence criteria, but warned that the \"longer-term sustainability of its economic convergence\" is of concern. It urged the country \"lock in\" recent competitive gains by keeping a cap on wage growth (or \"avoiding a renewed increase in unit labour cost growth\", as it put it). The ECB also called for improved economic governance, adding: It is crucial that a comprehensive policy toolkit is available to deal with risks to financial stability, including those stemming from the reliance of a significant part of the banking sector on non-resident deposits as a source of funding. The reference to \"non-resident deposits\" brings back memories of the Cyprus panic. Back in April, Otilia Simkova of Eurasia Group explained that Latvia's actually has a higher ratio of overseas savings. She wrote (in the FT): Foreign money, especially from Russia, has been trickling in. The level of non-resident deposits is heading for 50% of total deposits. By comparison, at its peak this year, the level of non-resident deposits in Cyprus was just 37%. Here's some early reaction: The prospect of a full-blown trade war between the European Union and China is looming closer today. Beijing retailiated against new tariffs on its solar panel industry, announced on Tuesday, by announcing that it would consider imposing new duties on EU wine. The tit-for-tat move raises the prospect of stiff price rises for bottles from countries such as Franch and Italy, at a time when Europe is hoping to export its way back to growth. From Brussels, our Europe editor Ian Traynor explained: A Europe-China trade war took firmer shape on Wednesday when Beijing announced it has opened an anti-dumping inquiry into EU wine exports a day after Brussels imposed tariffs on Chinese solar panels. Beijing's move came after weeks of intense lobbying against Karel De Gucht, the EU commissioner for trade, who resisted fierce German pressure not to impose the sanction and to give more time for negotiations. The Chinese strongly criticised the EU decision on solar panels, voicing \"resolute opposition\", adding that \"We hope the EU will further show their sincerity and show flexibility, through consultations to find mutually acceptable solutions\". De Gucht appeared to show flexibility yesterday, imposing the solar panel levy at under 12% for the first few weeks. It will rise to almost 50% in August if the two sides can't reach a deal soon over the alleged dumping of unfairly cheap Chinese solar panels on the European market. Here's the full story: China launches inquiry into European wine exports as trade war fears grow. It's official \u2013 the eurozone shrank by 0.2% in the first three months of 2013. That's in line with the preliminary reading from last month, confirming the eurozone lagged other major economies in Q1 2013. As explained at 9.51am, today's service sector data suggests the eurozone kept shrinking in May Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight reckons it's \"far from inconceivable\" that the recession will continue this quarter, adding: The hope is that it will be spared this fate by improved growth in Germany which should be helped by a rebound in construction activity after it was held back by the bad weather in the first quarter. And new shopping data, just released, add to the gloomy picture. Retail sales fell by 0.5% month-on-month in April, showing a 1.1% decline over the last year. At the risk of drowning in data, the UK service sector grew much faster than expected in. Its PMI of 54.9 for May, up from 52.9 in April, showed the fastest monthly growth since March 2012. The rise was partly attributed to better weather following Britain's god-awful winter. Markit's Chris Williamson said the UK economy had \"moved up a gear, with all cylinders firing\". Economists and City traders welcomed the news: The eurozone remains stuck in recession, but the downturn in its private sector eased in May, according to data provider Markit's latest survey of companies across the region. Its composite PMI, based on today's service sector and yesterday's manufacturing data, came in at 47.7, up from April\u2019s 46.9, which means it moved closer to growing again. But only one of its four largest economies, Germany, actually saw its private sector expand. Germany: 50.2 -- a 2-month high [where &gt;50 = growth] Spain: 47.2 -- a 23-month high Italy: 46.6 -- unchanged France: 44.6 -- 5-month high The data also showed that new orders fell and job losses rose. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the data was encouraging, but hardly a reason to cheer -- as the eurozone's long recession was clearly continuing. The final PMI confirms the message from the earlier flash reading that the eurozone remains gripped in the longest recession since the birth of the single currency, set to endure a seventh successive quarter of decline in the second quarter. The survey points to GDP falling by 0.2%, similar to the decline seen in the first quarter. Policymakers and politicians will nevertheless seek solace in the fact that the rate of decline has now eased for two consecutive months, and that Germany is stabilising. Downturns have also eased in France, Italy and especially Spain since earlier in the year. However, the reality is that the region lacks any growth drivers, making it difficult to believe that anything better than a mere stabilisation of economic activity remains unlikely for the foreseeable future. No relief for France in today's data -- its service sector kept shrinking at the same rate with a PMI of 44.3, unchanged from April. And Germany's PMI was slightly weaker than expected at 49.7. That indicates a small contraction again, but a little bit better than April (49.6). Italy's service sector shrank at a faster rate, according to this morning's PMI data. At 46.5, the reading was weaker than April's 47.0, suggesting the sector shrank at a faster rate. Prime minister Enrico Letta's challenge doesn't get any easier.... Spain's service sector shrank again in May for the 23rd month in a row, but at the slowest rate in almost two years. Markit's service sector PMI for Spain (the first in a series this morning) came in at 47.3, an improvement on April's 44.4. Although new business and employment fell, and optimism weakened, the data may show that better times are ahead. Andrew Harker, economist at Markit, said the data provided \"some cause for optimism\": Activity moved closer to stabilisation than at any time since mid-2011. Following on from a similar trend in the manufacturing PMI data, maybe we are starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel. Developments in the wider euro area economy over the next few months will probably be key to whether this turns out to be a false dawn or the start of a sustained recovery We'll get data from the rest of the eurozone over the next 30 minutes.... In the corporate world, supermarket chain Tesco has blamed austerity measures for falling sales at its European stores. Tesco reported a 5.5% drop in sales (excluding fuel) in Europe this morning, and said consumers in its international markets continue to face \"challenging\" conditions. It explained: In all markets, consumers continue to exercise caution in their shopping habits, as they face the direct impact of a variety of austerity measures linked to the tough economic environment. The impact of these external pressures increased in Ireland, with a significant reduction in consumer sentiment and spending following the announced introduction of a Local Property Tax on residential properties. Like for like sales in Ireland were down by 3%. Tesco's European arm also covers Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Turkey - which suffered the biggest drop (-15%), so eurozone austerity can't take all the blame.... It also reported a drop in UK sales -- we'll have more on this on the site shortly... As feared, European stock markets have also opened lower, following Japan's 3.8% drop overnight. The main indices are down around 0.7%, so nothing too dramatic, with the FTSE 100 dropping 46 points to 6512. Michael McCarthy, senior market strategist at CMC Markets, said investors are still pondering when central banks such as the Federal Reserve might slow their electronic money-printing programmes. Friday's US jobs data looms, as McCarthy explained: The \u201cwill they, won\u2019t they\u201d game of stimulus continues to dominate markets. US markets softened ahead of the data on Friday night, and Japanese investors roiled exporters\u2019 shares after comments from PM Abe were interpreted as too cautious. The Nikkei is now on the brink of a bear-market, having fallen around 19% from its peak last month: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone and the world economy. It's a busy morning for data. New services sector surveys will show how Europe's private firms fared in May, while revised GDP figures should confirm that the eurozone remains in recession. But first, Japan's prime minister has unveiled the next stage of his economic recovery plan - to an underwhelmed reception. The Nikkei slid by 3.8% after Shinzo Abe fired the so-called 'Third Arrow', while the yen remains below the \u00a5100 mark against the US dollar. in a much-anticipated speech, Abe said he would: \u2022 create special economic zones to lure foreign businesses to Japan. These areas could offer lower tax rates and other incentives. \u2022 Fully liberalise the retail electricity market \u2022 Increase investment in power related infrastructure to 30 trillion yen over the next decade \u2022 Raise incomes by 3 percent annually (thus keeping wages above Abe's 2% inflation target) Abe said that final point was a clear priority, telling the nation: That's because the aim of our growth strategy is nothing other than to create jobs for enthusiastic people and raise take-home pay for those who are working hard. In short, to let households benefit. That's the point. Further details of the plan are expected in the weeks ahead. But the strategy did not wow Japan's markets today \u2013 suggesting Abenomics may be losing its sparkle. Some analysts said the plan didn't sound ambitious enough, while others questioned whether the income growth target could be met while also encouraging firms to hire more temporary (cheaper?) wokers. As Sophia University professor Koichi Nakano put it: His government is very good at PR strategy, but it really does look more like a campaign platform rather than anything worthy of the name of economic policies. With the world watching Abe's plans with nervous interest, the Nikkei's fall will probably hit shares in Europe this morning. Reaction to follow, along with other events through the day...",

However, officials acknowledged that the program\u2019s macroeconomic projections had risks to the downside that materialized in a context of political instability and deposit outflows.</p> <p>Also, in calculating the effects of tax measures, price and income elasticities were underestimated and this reduced the revenue yield</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Translation: Perhaps we should have known how bad things would be.

However, the crisis and the recession have had terrible consequences for Greece in terms of unemployment and have caused severe stress in society with extreme parties now gaining support.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Translation: Looks like we've helped to fuel support for a neo-nazi party.

For the first time since the outbreak of the crisis, figures show the country being braced for a bumper year with some 17 million visitors due to fly in. In Athens, alone, industry figures are reporting a 10 percent increase \u2013 a huge boost for a capital that barely a year ago was associated solely with street riots and strikes. \u201cIt is going to be a bumper year,\u201d said Andreas Andreadis, who heads the Association of Hellenic Tourism Enterprises (SETE). \u201cThe crisis has made Greek enterprises, everyone, much more aware. Greek society understands that tourism can help the country get out of the crisis, by first of all creating jobs,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>Tourism, which contributed around \u20ac32bn to economic output in 2012, accounts for almost 17% of GDP. Roughly 780,000 people are employed in the sector. Andreadis, who has been widely credited with innovatively bumping up the private sector\u2019s role in marketing the country \u2013 previously promoted by lacklustre state bodies \u2013 wants to transform Greece into one of the ten best quality destinations worldwide. To that end, Greece must think outside the box by turning away from the mass market, where deteriorating competiveness has lessened its appeal, and tapping larger, long-haul emerging source markets such as the US, China and Russia. Moves are already afoot.</p> <p>Thanks to a lifting of visa restrictions \u201c13,000 visas in Russia are being issued for Greece every day,\u201d he said. \u201cThe volume is so high that SETE has employed 20 of its own people just to help stamp visas.\u201d Russian arrivals at regional airports, as a result, have already shot up by 230%.</p> <p>The increase in arrivals is vital to helping austerity-hit Greeks, now blighted by the worst unemployment rate in the euro zone, survive the next year.</p> <p>Last year, the 15.5 million tourists who visited Greece spent 650 euro on average. This year, the hope is that 17 million will spend an average \u20ac670. By 2021, Andreadis says, the aim is to attract 24 million tourists who will spend an average \u20ac800 \u2013 \u20ac50bn in total \u2013 thus ensuring jobs for around one million people.</p> <p>&#xa0;\u201cBetter quality will be central to generating that demand,\u201d he said adding that a new PR and branding strategy, focusing on luxury tourism, would also be vital to turning tourism \u2013 and the economy \u2013 around. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51af533ee4b029ed1cfbe6df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-05T15:03:26.987Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking of bear markets....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/chrisadamsmkts/statuses/342292599010377728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>RUSSIAN BEAR RT <a href=\"https://twitter.com/boes_\">@boes_</a> Russia&#39;s RTS index falls 20% from January peak, enters bear market: BBG</p>&mdash; Chris Adams (@chrisadamsmkts) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisadamsmkts/statuses/342292599010377728\">June 5, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>This graph shows how the RTS Index has slid this year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b799ec64-a9c5-4499-b9de-7f81d68075c5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/5/1370444580523/b784400b-ee42-4772-8335-5ce844d20f31-460x203.png\" alt=\"Russian stock market, year to June 5 2015\" width=\"460\" height=\"203\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: /Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51af4f54e4b029ed1cfbe6d1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-05T14:53:15.160Z\">3.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US economics catch-up</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-724dab26-2848-481b-a0a7-892a89fa18c1\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/5/1370443954223/df0fcd07-e2f4-437c-a05b-1d818d0aab1d-460x315.png\" alt=\"US private payroll\" width=\"460\" height=\"315\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">&nbsp;Photograph: /ADP/Marketwatch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Various gobbets of economic news from the US this afternoon.</strong></p> <p>1) 135,000 private jobs were created in America last month, a slight increase on April's reading but lower than expected.

Latvia's GDP increased by 1.2% in the first three months of 2013, defying the 0.2% contraction across the eurozone. The economy is 5.6% larger than a year ago.</p> <p>But the country, of around 2.2m people, still suffers high poverty levels and income inequality.</p> <p>According to the <strong>Baltic Centre for Economic Policy Studies</strong>, over 30% of the population is classified as \u201cseverely materially deprived,\u201d in 2010. That means they can't afford to pay rent, food bills or utility costs. This is the worst figure in the EU.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/03/25/in_latvia_a_toughlove_economy_leaves_losers_behind.html\">And as the Toronto Star reported in March,</a> there is a yawning gap between rich and poor in Latvia. Especially outside Riga, the capital city:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Take a trip east out of Riga and you will see the faces of austerity.</p> <p>Small cottages and worn farmhouses poke through the deep snow.

Most houses have chickens and a couple cows to supplement paltry monthly government assistance cheques of about 35 lats.</p> <p>Almost all of the young people have fled \u2014 to Italy, Germany or Spain.</p> <p>In Kuprava, about 10 minutes from the Russian border, , the official unemployment rate is 20 per cent.

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund is to admit that it has made serious mistakes in the handling of the sovereign debt crisis in Greece, according to internal reports due to be published later on Wednesday. Documents presented to the Fund's board last Friday will reveal that the Washington-based organisation underestimated the damage austerity would cause to the eurozone country, which has required two bailouts in the past three years. The Wall Street Journal reported that the papers would say that financial support from the Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission had bought time for Greece but had only been made possible because the IMF had bent its own rules to make the country's debt look more sustainable than it was. According to the WSJ report, Greece failed to meet three of the Fund's four tests to qualify for help. A Fund spokeswoman said: \"We will be publishing a number of papers on Greece later today. The board met last Friday to discuss several documents on Greece including the review of its programme and its annual economic assessment.\" Greece became the first eurozone nation to require a bailout by the international community in 2010, but needed a second round of financial assistance in early 2012 when a deep recession and high interest payments threatened to send its debts spiralling out of control. The so-called troika of the IMF, ECB and EC forced private sector bondholders to write down the value of their Greek bonds in an attempt to bring the country's debts down to sustainable levels of 120% of national income by 2020. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the Fund, has said many times over the past year that Greece should now be in a position to pay off its debts, but the WSJ reports that IMF staff believe this cannot be said with any certainty. In Athens, officials reacted with barely disguised glee to the news. The report confirms what Greek officials have long said: that the first bailout of uncompromising budget cuts and tax increases, the price of 110 bn euro in emergency funds in May 2010, was the wrong prescription for a country not only batting a monumental debt load but rampant tax evasion and a flourishing black economy. Under the weight of such measures \u2013 applied across the board and hitting the poorest hardest \u2013 the economy, they said, was always bound to dive into an economic death spiral. \"For too long they [troika officials] refused to accept that the programme was simply off-target by hiding behind our failure to implement structural reforms,\" said one insider. \"Now that reforms are being applied they've had to accept the bitter truth.\" The Greek media recently quoted IMF managing director Christine Lagarde describing 2011 as a \"lost year\" partly because of miscalculations by the EU and IMF.

      "bodyText": "Services make up three quarters of Britain's national output so the sharp increase in the June purchasing managers' index for the sector bodes well for growth, not just in the second quarter but for 2013 as a whole. The Office for Budget Responsibility predicted at the time of the budget that Britain would grow by only 0.3% this year. That now looks overly pessimistic, not just as a result of the better than expected service sector PMI \u2013 which recorded its fifth successive increase \u2013 but because other recent data have suggested that the economy has turned the corner. It is, of course, too soon to say. Britain could easily be blown off course again by events in the rest of the world. The eurozone is in recession, while activity in both the US and China is slowing. Consumers' real incomes remain under pressure as a result of prices rising faster than wages. Deficit reduction will, as the IMF noted, act as a brake on growth this year. But in the past few days there have been reports showing a pickup in the three big sectors of the economy \u2013 services, manufacturing and construction. Consumers are not exactly in party mood, but they are a lot less gloomy than they were. Inflation is coming down, which means the real income squeeze is far less powerful than it was a year ago. The service sector PMI is, though, perhaps the strongest piece of evidence that recovery is under way. The two percentage point jump in June was far bigger than expected and took the index to its highest in more than a year. The improvement was broad-based. Why is this happening? A combination of factors, in all likelihood. Four years of cheap money \u2013 bank rate at 0.5% and \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing \u2013 are having an impact. The funding for lending scheme is channelling money into the mortgage market. After years of making do, companies are having to replace bits of kit. Consumers, fed up with being fed up, are starting to spend a little more freely. Growth in the second quarter is, as a result, likely to accelerate from the 0.3% in the first three months of 2013 to perhaps 0.5% or 0.6%. Something close to 1.5% for 2013 would then look eminently feasible. Historically, that would be no great shakes and would still leave activity below its peak in early 2008. But everything's relative; it was only six weeks ago that the speculation was about a triple-dip recession.",

      "body": "<p>Services make up three quarters of Britain's national output so the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jun/05/uk-services-sector-economy-cips-markit\" title=\"\">sharp increase in the June purchasing managers' index</a> for the sector bodes well for growth, not just in the second quarter but for 2013 as a whole.</p> <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility predicted at the time of the budget that Britain would grow by only 0.3% this year. That now looks overly pessimistic, not just as a result of the better than expected service sector PMI \u2013 which recorded its fifth successive increase \u2013 but because other recent data have suggested that the economy has turned the corner.</p> <p>It is, of course, too soon to say. Britain could easily be blown off course again by events in the rest of the world. The eurozone is in recession, while activity in both the US and China is slowing. Consumers' real incomes remain under pressure as a result of prices rising faster than wages. Deficit reduction will, as the IMF noted, act as a brake on growth this year.</p> <p>But in the past few days there have been reports showing a pickup in the three big sectors of the economy \u2013 services, manufacturing and construction.</p> <p>Consumers are not exactly in party mood, but they are a lot less gloomy than they were. Inflation is coming down, which means the real income squeeze is far less powerful than it was a year ago.</p> <p>The service sector PMI is, though, perhaps the strongest piece of evidence that recovery is under way. The two percentage point jump in June was far bigger than expected and took the index to its highest in more than a year. The improvement was broad-based.</p> <p>Why is this happening? A combination of factors, in all likelihood. Four years of cheap money \u2013 bank rate at 0.5% and \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing \u2013 are having an impact. The funding for lending scheme is channelling money into the mortgage market. After years of making do, companies are having to replace bits of kit. Consumers, fed up with being fed up, are starting to spend a little more freely.</p> <p>Growth in the second quarter is, as a result, likely to accelerate from the 0.3% in the first three months of 2013 to perhaps 0.5% or 0.6%. Something close to 1.5% for 2013 would then look eminently feasible.</p> <p>Historically, that would be no great shakes and would still leave activity below its peak in early 2008. But everything's relative; it was only six weeks ago that the speculation was about a triple-dip recession.</p>",

      "bodyText": "MPs have raised serious concerns about the suitability of Dame Clara Furse, a former boss of the London Stock Exchange, to sit on a powerful new body overseeing financial stability. Even so, the Treasury select committee (TSC), which subjected Furse to a grilling this week, cleared her appointment to the financial policy committee of the Bank of England. Despite its reservations about Furse, who sat on the capital and risk committee at Dutch-Belgian financial firm Fortis during the ill-fated ABN Amro takeover, the MPs concluded she had \"the professional competence and personal independence\" to be a member of the FPC. The endorsement of the first female member of the body set up to identify and defuse the next financial crisis followed a difficult appearance for Furse before the committee on Tuesday. She was grilled about her role on the board of Fortis, which was bailed out by Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourg taxpayers during the 2008 financial crisis. The committee said its concerns were based on her lack of awareness about demonstrating the FPC's independence from the government and the way she explained her role on the board of Fortis. The bank was involved in the takeover of Dutch rival ABN Amro along with Royal Bank of Scotland, which also needed be rescued after completing the deal during the height of the credit crunch. She would have been braced for the concerns of the committee as during her evidence she had been told by the Conservative MP Jesse Norman that her evidence was \"amazingly unimpressive\". He told her he was considering whether to support her appointment to the FPC. She told MPs she had learnt from her \"searing\" experience on the Fortis board. She was also asked at the committee whether the FPC should have urgent powers to impose tougher leverage ratios \u2013 a gauge of the risks being run by banks \u2013 and had annoyed members by saying she did not think such extra measures were necessary. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the TSC, said: \"The FPC will sometimes have to take decisions that are politically unpopular. It is vital that it is independent from government influence. The FPC's external members should also challenge the views of those from inside the Bank and ensure the committee does not fall prey to group-think.\" The Bank of England issued a statement saying it was looking forward to the contributions that Furse and the two other new members of the FPC \u2013 former Barclays boss Martin Taylor and ex-Goldman Sachs banker Richard Sharp \u2013 would make to the committee. Sharp, who had been questioned by MPs about whether he could be independent because of his donations to the Conservative party, had admitted he needed to improve his technical knowledge of bank capital. The committee backed his appointment on the basis that he himself has recognised that he will need to acquire technical knowledge, we are satisfied that Mr Sharp has the professional competence and personal independence to be an external member of the FPC,\" the TSC said. Taylor satisfied the committee of his credentials, having sat on the Vickers independent commission on banking which recommended banks erect a ringfence between their high street operations and investment banking arms. \"We will expect to see evidence that the concerns raised in this report have been taken on board,\" said Tyrie. The TSC has been critical of appointments to the FPC, a key plank of the coalition's new approach to financial regulation, in the past. In June 2011, when the FPC was just being created, the MPs had called for an additional external member to be appointed and raised questions about the independence of Alistair Clark, a former Bank employee. The three new appointments are to replace Clark, Robert Jenkins and Michael Cohrs.",

      "body": "<p>The economy regained some of its former vibrancy in May after a bigger than expected surge in services activity showed that all major sectors are now growing for the first time in a year.</p> <p>Following figures earlier this week that found the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/04/construction-revival-help-to-buy\" title=\"\">construction</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/03/manufacturing-rebound-economic-recovery\" title=\"\">manufacturing</a> sectors back in positive territory during May, the CIPS/Markit survey of the services sector showed it expanded more strongly than expected.</p> <p>The broad-based recovery is likely to end the debate about a triple-dip recession, especially after the economy grew in the first quarter of the year by 0.3%. It is now showing every sign of outstripping that figure in the second quarter.</p> <p>Markit said an increase in new business was behind much of the rise in its index of services activity to 54.9, up from April's 52.9. The index signalled a rate of growth that was the sharpest since March 2012, it said.</p> <p>With sales up and the cost of production remaining steady, the profitability of the UK corporate sector should be more upbeat, but the Markit profitability index came in below the key level of 50 \u2013 the mark that separates growth from contraction.</p> <p>\"The latest fall in profitability was the 12th in successive survey periods, although the rate of decline was the slowest in this sequence,\" it said. \"Where a fall in profits was reported, a number of companies blamed a combination of discounting and higher input costs. In contrast, other respondents signalled that higher sales and associated growth in turnover had supported profitability in the three months to May.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, firms reported that they were employing more workers, spurring a fifth straight monthly rise in services sector employment.</p> <p>Alan Clarke, chief UK economist at Scotia Bank, struck a note of concern after he asked whether the bounce from last year's lows was likely to last more than a few months.</p> <p>\"I remain a little sceptical that this momentum can be maintained.

      "bodyText": "The economy regained some of its former vibrancy in May after a bigger than expected surge in services activity showed that all major sectors are now growing for the first time in a year. Following figures earlier this week that found the construction and manufacturing sectors back in positive territory during May, the CIPS/Markit survey of the services sector showed it expanded more strongly than expected. The broad-based recovery is likely to end the debate about a triple-dip recession, especially after the economy grew in the first quarter of the year by 0.3%. It is now showing every sign of outstripping that figure in the second quarter. Markit said an increase in new business was behind much of the rise in its index of services activity to 54.9, up from April's 52.9. The index signalled a rate of growth that was the sharpest since March 2012, it said. With sales up and the cost of production remaining steady, the profitability of the UK corporate sector should be more upbeat, but the Markit profitability index came in below the key level of 50 \u2013 the mark that separates growth from contraction. \"The latest fall in profitability was the 12th in successive survey periods, although the rate of decline was the slowest in this sequence,\" it said. \"Where a fall in profits was reported, a number of companies blamed a combination of discounting and higher input costs. In contrast, other respondents signalled that higher sales and associated growth in turnover had supported profitability in the three months to May.\" Nevertheless, firms reported that they were employing more workers, spurring a fifth straight monthly rise in services sector employment. Alan Clarke, chief UK economist at Scotia Bank, struck a note of concern after he asked whether the bounce from last year's lows was likely to last more than a few months. \"I remain a little sceptical that this momentum can be maintained. In particular, with government spending growth about to stall and real household disposable income growth turning negative I struggle to see how this sort of pace of growth can be maintained,\" he said. Some economists have argued that the recent better economic news merely reflects a rebound from the artificially low activity last year when firms, spooked by the euro crisis and the UK's double-dip recession, cut investment spending and reduced stocks. Capital Economics, which has consistently warned that the UK faces a Japanese-style lost decade of low growth, said the figures remained subdued for an economy recovering from a severe recession, though any talk of recession was now in the past. The firm's UK economist, Martin Beck, said: \"Following a run of generally good economic news in recent weeks, May's UK CIPS/Markit report on services provides another indication that the economy may be turning a corner. The activity index rose from 52.9 to 54.9, the fifth consecutive monthly increase and the highest reading since March 2012. \"What's more, the CBI's recent services sector survey also suggested growing momentum in services activity. With May also seeing improvements in the manufacturing and construction CIPS, a weighted average of the three surveys points to quarterly GDP growth of about 0.5%. \"While such a rate would still be pretty modest for an economy emerging from a long period of recession and stagnation, signs that the recovery may be establishing some momentum are becoming more convincing.\"",

A study of every census for England and Wales since 1841 shows that almost two-thirds of the population worked in factories or on the land at the start of Britain's mid-Victorian heyday. The Office for National Statistics said 36% of the workforce was employed in manufacturing and a further 22% in agriculture and fishing, while 33% worked in services, half of them as domestic servants. By the early 1880s, more people worked in services than manufacturing although the big fall in industrial employment did not begin until the 1960s. Britain, the first country to go through an industrial revolution, was the dominant world economy in the 1840s and that strength was concentrated north of a line drawn from the Wash to the Severn Estuary.

In its study, the ONS charts the increasing sophistication of manufacturing over 170 years, a period in which vastly improved productivity has allowed more to be produced by fewer workers.

The service sector accounted for 81% of the 26.5 million employees in England and Wales. The latest census shows that three times as many people work in the public sector (28.4%) as in industry. The ONS said that no part of England and Wales had more than a quarter of its workforce employed in manufacturing, with the highest concentration (24%) found in Corby in the East Midlands, where an enterprise zone with industrial parks was set up in an attempt to compensate for the decline of the steel industry. In the service industries, the highest concentration of estate agents is to be found in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea (3.4%) and Hackney has the highest proportion of people working in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector (8.3%).

      "body": "<h2>Annalisa Piazza, UK analyst at Newedge Strategy</h2> <p>The UK services PMI survey showed further momentum in business confidence in May. The overall sentiment indicator rose by a solid two points to 54.9 in May, exceeding expectations for a more modest increase. The index is now at its highest level since late 2011 and it suggests the services sector is running at a very decent speed (not consistent with recent hard data). Given the still blurred economic situation, we are sceptical on the effective materialisation of a boom in the UK services sector near term. However, today's survey certainly shows that the mix of very accommodative monetary policy, coupled with timid signs of improvement from abroad, have a positive impact on sentiment.</p> <p>Coupled with the upward surprise for the manufacturing PMI earlier this week, the survey consolidates the idea that the monetary policy committee will keep policy unchanged after this week's meeting. That said, policymakers will also have to read between the lines of recent hard data, with Q1-3 GDP rising on the back of rising inventories (and not much else) and still weak retail activity.</p> <p>Low wage growth is not encouraging for future spending and the recent decline in headline inflation is well below the recent IR projections. In a nutshell, this week's survey has been encouraging but the overall picture for the UK economy is far from being clear.

      "bodyText": "Annalisa Piazza, UK analyst at Newedge Strategy The UK services PMI survey showed further momentum in business confidence in May. The overall sentiment indicator rose by a solid two points to 54.9 in May, exceeding expectations for a more modest increase. The index is now at its highest level since late 2011 and it suggests the services sector is running at a very decent speed (not consistent with recent hard data). Given the still blurred economic situation, we are sceptical on the effective materialisation of a boom in the UK services sector near term. However, today's survey certainly shows that the mix of very accommodative monetary policy, coupled with timid signs of improvement from abroad, have a positive impact on sentiment. Coupled with the upward surprise for the manufacturing PMI earlier this week, the survey consolidates the idea that the monetary policy committee will keep policy unchanged after this week's meeting. That said, policymakers will also have to read between the lines of recent hard data, with Q1-3 GDP rising on the back of rising inventories (and not much else) and still weak retail activity. Low wage growth is not encouraging for future spending and the recent decline in headline inflation is well below the recent IR projections. In a nutshell, this week's survey has been encouraging but the overall picture for the UK economy is far from being clear. Caution will remain high, in our view. James Knightley, UK economist at ING bank Encouragingly, we have seen strong rises in the new orders components for all three series [manufacturing, construction and services] with today's service sector figure coming in at 57.2, the strongest reading since February 2010.

Indeed, the composite PMI for the services, manufacturing and construction output jumped to a 14-month high of 54.6 in May from 52.4 in April, taking it well above the 50 level that indicates flat activity. Of course, the UK economy still faces very challenging domestic and global conditions and relapses remain very possible, so it is important not to get too carried away with the latest data. The improved set of purchasing managers surveys for May reinforces belief that the Bank of England will sit tight on all aspects of monetary policy when the June MPC [monetary policy committee] meeting ends on Thursday.

Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said:</p> <blockquote> With tomorrow's rate verdicts from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, then Friday's non-farm payrolls, there's scope for traders to get another [boost] before the week is out but at least for now it's an air of caution that's prevailing and the bears seem to be battling for control. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>Tesco</strong> has lost 13.85p to 350.6p after its trading update missed City forecasts, while a number of companies saw their shares go ex-dividend, including <strong>National Grid</strong>, down 34p at 756.5p, and <strong>WPP</strong>, 18p lower at \u00a311.02.</p> <p><strong>Aberdeen Asset Management</strong> has dropped 20.3p to 443.6p in the wake of Tuesday's news that director Anne Richards had sold more than \u00a36m worth of shares. UBS has removed the company from its key call list but remain buyers.</p> <p><strong>Arm</strong> has recovered 8p to 932p after recent weakness on worries about growing competition in its key tablet market from Intel. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said:</p> <blockquote> Simon Segars, Arm's upcoming chief executive, presented at our global tech conf yesterday. When asked about Intel's win at Samsung for a 10'' tablet, Mr Segars commented that Samsung has a tradition to use multiple suppliers and that not all Android apps run on x86 CPUs, potentially hindering user experience. <br> Arm recently raised its 2020 royalty revenues compound annual growth rate guidance. Mr Segars <br>explained that Arm raised its guidance due to 1) expected share gains in existing and new markets, 2) higher royalty rates and 3) confidence in the underlying growth rate of Arm's core markets. We also believe Arm gave this guidance probably knowing fully well that Intel had won a tablet socket at Samsung. This indicates, in our view, how confident Arm's management is in the long term growth trajectory of its business. <br> <br>We see the recent weakness in the stock as a particular buying opportunity as we believe that Arm's ecosystem is likely to prevail long term. </blockquote> <p><strong>Wolseley</strong> is 15p better at \u00a331.60 following Tuesday's decline on caution about its European business.</p> <p><strong>Tate and Lyle</strong> has climbed 4p to 836p after Investec moved from hold to buy. Analyst Martin Deboo said:</p> <blockquote> With the shares back to around 830p post-prelims, having under-performed the late spring rally by 8%, we once again see an attractive entry point to this story. We resume a buy recommendation, at an increased 900p target price. Speciality food ingredients (SFI) growth looks set to resume with sucralose back on track. Plus we think the market would applaud a consolidating move in SFI. What's not to like? Low overall growth in 2014 and downside risk in bulk ingredients, most obviously. However bulk guidance feels sensibly cautious and has now been ingested by the market. </blockquote> <p><strong>Moneysupermarket.com</strong> has added 5.3p to 213p despite news that founder Simon Nixon - who moved to a non-exec role in April - planned to sell a 14.8% stake in the business. The company is also returning \u00a370m to shareholders with a special dividend of 12.92p a share. It also issued an upbeat trading statement. David Reynolds at Jefferies said:</p> <blockquote> Investors will welcome the increased liquidity, the punchy return of cash and whilst the brief trading update 'in line and revenues up in excess of 10% year on year' won't blow one's socks off - we look for 10.4% revenue growth for 2013 - it is in line. </blockquote> <p>But hedge fund group <strong>Man</strong> has slumped nearly 11%, down 12.6p to 103.9p, after it said its flagship product AHL saw its net asset value fall by 6.1% last week, one of its biggest weekly declines. UBS cut from buy to neutral and reduced its target price from 130p to 110p:</p> <blockquote> (i) AHL has had an 12% pull back from its recent peak, leading to a significant cut to earnings, but also reducing the probability of flows turning (ii) Japanese retail's risk appetite may have been negatively impacted by the recent bout of volatility (iii) valuation on our mark to market estimates is less compelling. </blockquote> <p>Peter Lenardos at RBC Capital Markets said:</p> <blockquote> We believe that AHL is long the Nikkei 225. In the week to 3 June, the Nikkei is off 6.2%. <br> </blockquote> <p>There was also talk that AHL was on the wrong side of US treasury bonds.</p>",

Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said: With tomorrow's rate verdicts from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, then Friday's non-farm payrolls, there's scope for traders to get another [boost] before the week is out but at least for now it's an air of caution that's prevailing and the bears seem to be battling for control. Tesco has lost 13.85p to 350.6p after its trading update missed City forecasts, while a number of companies saw their shares go ex-dividend, including National Grid, down 34p at 756.5p, and WPP, 18p lower at \u00a311.02. Aberdeen Asset Management has dropped 20.3p to 443.6p in the wake of Tuesday's news that director Anne Richards had sold more than \u00a36m worth of shares. UBS has removed the company from its key call list but remain buyers. Arm has recovered 8p to 932p after recent weakness on worries about growing competition in its key tablet market from Intel. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said: Simon Segars, Arm's upcoming chief executive, presented at our global tech conf yesterday. When asked about Intel's win at Samsung for a 10'' tablet, Mr Segars commented that Samsung has a tradition to use multiple suppliers and that not all Android apps run on x86 CPUs, potentially hindering user experience. Arm recently raised its 2020 royalty revenues compound annual growth rate guidance. Mr Segars explained that Arm raised its guidance due to 1) expected share gains in existing and new markets, 2) higher royalty rates and 3) confidence in the underlying growth rate of Arm's core markets. We also believe Arm gave this guidance probably knowing fully well that Intel had won a tablet socket at Samsung. This indicates, in our view, how confident Arm's management is in the long term growth trajectory of its business. We see the recent weakness in the stock as a particular buying opportunity as we believe that Arm's ecosystem is likely to prevail long term. Wolseley is 15p better at \u00a331.60 following Tuesday's decline on caution about its European business. Tate and Lyle has climbed 4p to 836p after Investec moved from hold to buy. Analyst Martin Deboo said: With the shares back to around 830p post-prelims, having under-performed the late spring rally by 8%, we once again see an attractive entry point to this story. We resume a buy recommendation, at an increased 900p target price. Speciality food ingredients (SFI) growth looks set to resume with sucralose back on track. Plus we think the market would applaud a consolidating move in SFI. What's not to like? Low overall growth in 2014 and downside risk in bulk ingredients, most obviously. However bulk guidance feels sensibly cautious and has now been ingested by the market. Moneysupermarket.com has added 5.3p to 213p despite news that founder Simon Nixon - who moved to a non-exec role in April - planned to sell a 14.8% stake in the business. The company is also returning \u00a370m to shareholders with a special dividend of 12.92p a share. It also issued an upbeat trading statement. David Reynolds at Jefferies said: Investors will welcome the increased liquidity, the punchy return of cash and whilst the brief trading update 'in line and revenues up in excess of 10% year on year' won't blow one's socks off - we look for 10.4% revenue growth for 2013 - it is in line. But hedge fund group Man has slumped nearly 11%, down 12.6p to 103.9p, after it said its flagship product AHL saw its net asset value fall by 6.1% last week, one of its biggest weekly declines. UBS cut from buy to neutral and reduced its target price from 130p to 110p: (i) AHL has had an 12% pull back from its recent peak, leading to a significant cut to earnings, but also reducing the probability of flows turning (ii) Japanese retail's risk appetite may have been negatively impacted by the recent bout of volatility (iii) valuation on our mark to market estimates is less compelling. Peter Lenardos at RBC Capital Markets said: We believe that AHL is long the Nikkei 225. In the week to 3 June, the Nikkei is off 6.2%. There was also talk that AHL was on the wrong side of US treasury bonds.",
