      "bodyText": "And finally... Greece\u2019s prime minister has hailed the deal. Alexis Tsipras tweeted that Today Greece is turning a page. We have an agreement that corresponds to the sacrifices of the Greek people. He added that: With unity and determination we move forward for fair growth and the healing of the wounds of the crisis. Stirring stuff. But some analysts aren\u2019t convinced that the deal is quite that sweeping - given there\u2019s still no concrete pledge for meaningful debt relief. Wolf Piccoli of Teneo Intelligence argues that Greece is still in a fix: And that\u2019s a good moment to wrap up. Good night! GW Here are some photos from today\u2019s eurogroup meeting in Luxembourg, where the Greek bailout deal was agreed: Here\u2019s Marketwatch\u2019s explanation of how the IMF is finally coming on board and joining the Greek bailout.... Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, on Thursday unveiled a plan that will unlock some new funding for Greece. Lagarde said she would ask the IMF board to back \u201cthe approval in principle\u201d of a new IMF loan for Greece. The deal will unlock some IMF funding thus \u201creducing serious stress on the Greek economy,\u201d Lagarde said. Greece is facing debt repayment in July. On the debt relief issue, the eurozone finance ministers have agreed to consider extending the maturity of some Greek bonds. That\u2019s a way of providing debt relief without actually writing the loans off. So something of a fudge, really - but one that all sides can live with. Reuters explains: To accommodate the IMF\u2019s need for more specifics on debt relief, the euro zone finance ministers said in a statement that in 2018 they would be ready to consider extending the maturities and grace periods of their loans to Greece by a range from zero to 15 years. The average maturity now is 30 years. But they did not go any further than that and the IMF said it was not enough to calculate Greek debt sustainability. The AFP newswire have a good write-up of tonight\u2019s deal, by Alex Pigman. Here\u2019s a flavour: Eurozone agrees Greek bailout payment, IMF comes on board Eurozone ministers struck a long-delayed bailout deal with Greece on Thursday to unlock badly needed rescue cash, but warned Athens would have to wait for debt relief. After hours of talks in Luxembourg IMF chief Christine Lagarde and the eurozone\u2019s 19 finance ministers greenlit a payout of 8.5 billion euros to meet debt payments due in July and avoid another summer of Greek crisis. Payment of the latest tranche of Greece\u2019s 86-billion euro ($97-billion) has been held up for months by a row over its needs for debt relief pitting bailout-weary Germany against the IMF. \u201cI am pleased to announce we have achieved an agreement on all elements,\u201d Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem told a news conference. \u201cI think this is a major step forward,\u201d he said. In a breakthrough, Lagarde agreed in Luxembourg that the Washington-based IMF would join Greece\u2019s massive bailout, but said any payouts depended on the eurozone coming up with a full debt relief plan. \u201cNobody claims that this is the best solution. This is a second best solution, but it\u2019s not a bad solution,\u201d said Lagarde, a former French finance minister. The deal averts a repeat of the summer of 2015 when Greece spectacularly defaulted on an IMF loan, and allows Athens to meet seven billion euros of debt repayments due in July. Athens all week insisted it would veto the deal, bitter that the latest disbursement would come without firm debt relief commitments after it delivered on tough reforms. As a consolation, in a compromise negotiated by France, Greece won a certain amount of clarity from the eurozone on debt relief. Debt relief \u201cwill be implemented at the end of the programme, conditional on its successful implementation\u201d in 2018, said Dijsselbloem, who is also Dutch finance minister. The eurozone would now draw up an \u201cexit strategy\u201d over the next year \u201cto enable Greece to stand on its own feet again\u201d, Dijsselbloem said. Here\u2019s the official line from the International Monetary Fund: The IMF has long been pushing the eurozone to admit that Greece needs debt relief to put the country\u2019s finances on a sustainable level. European Council president Donald Tusk has also applauded the news: European commissioner Pierre Moscovici has welcomed tonight\u2019s agreement to extend Greece its next bailout loan: But there is scepticism too. Carsten Brzeski of Dutch bank ING points out that there isn\u2019t any debt relief yet, and the IMF still haven\u2019t put any money in. Greece\u2019s finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, says tonight\u2019s deal provides \u2018light at the end of the tunnel\u2019. He explains that the eurogroup has given greater clarity about the medium-term debt relief which Greece can look forward to once its bailout programme has been successfully completed in summer 2018. The eurozone is committed to helping Greece stand on its own two feet, Tsakalotos adds. However, Tsakalotos also hints at some unhappiness, suggesting that Greece deserves even more given what it has endured, and achieved. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, says the Bundestag will consider whether to back this deal on Friday. That\u2019s because the eurogroup\u2019s decision needs to be ratified by national parliaments. Schauble told reporters in Luxembourg that the deal will help improve Greece\u2019s economy. \u201cGreece has to become competitive to get access to debt markets so it can stand on its own two feet. \u201cFor that Greece has to carry out reforms.\u201d. A late newsflash: Eurozone finance ministers have reached a deal to unlock \u20ac8.5bn in urgently needed loans. The eurogroup reached the deal tonight, ending months of uncertainty, giving Greece the financial assistance it needs to meet debt repayments this summer (yes, Greece is bring lent more money so it can pay older loans back). It will be split into three payments - the first, in early July, will cover debt repayments and various arrears. In a statement, the eurogroup welcomed the measures Greece has taken under its economic reform programme (which include painful austerity, tax rises and spending cuts). Importantly, the International Monetary Fund has moved closer to finally supporting Greece\u2019s bailout (which was agreed almost two years ago and expires in August 2018). It is proposing to join the bailout this summer, but would not actually disburse any money until there is an agreement on Greek debt relief..... Here\u2019s the details: Acknowledging the staff level agreement reached with Greece on policies, IMF management will shortly recommend to the IMF\u2019s Executive Board the approval in principle of Greece\u2019s request for a 14-month Standby Arrangement. The IMF welcomes the further specification of the debt measures given today by Member States, and agrees that it represents a major step towards Greek debt sustainability. The IMF arrangement will become effective with resources made available in accordance with its terms, provided that the programme stays on track, when IMF staff can assure to the IMF\u2019s Executive Board that there is an agreement on debt relief measures, that, appropriately calibrated at the end of the programme, would secure debt sustainability. On debt relief, the Eurogroup have confirmed their commitment to an early pledge to address Greece\u2019s debt pile - but any move would only come after this current bailout. IMF chief Christine Lagarde says this is limited progress; not ideal, but enough to avoid a summer crisis. Time for a quick recap The Bank of England has surprised the markets by revealing that three policymakers have voted to raise interest rates. At her final meeting, Kristin Forbes pushed for borrowing costs to rise from 0.25% to 0.5%, and was supported by fellow MPC members Michael Sanders and Ian McCafferty. The three hawks have highlighted the Bank\u2019s concerns about inflation, which jumped to 2.9% earlier this week. But there other five members are more concerned about the UK economy. Our economics editor Larry Elliott argues that the doves are right: Households are spending less, the housing market is weak, new car registrations have plunged and wage growth has fallen back, even though more people are in jobs. On balance, the arguments in favour of leaving rates where they are look more compelling than the arguments for raising them The latest economic data has highlighted why the Bank is worried. UK retail sales volumes fell sharply last month, contracting by 1.2%. On an annual basis, Britons bought just 0.9% more stuff than a year ago -- the smallest rise in four years. City traders were jolted by the news, sending the FTSE 100 and 250 indices down sharply today. Furniture maker DFS added to the anxiety by reporting that its sales have fallen materially in recent weeks. Its shares plunged by a fifth following this morning\u2019s profits warning. Over in Luxembourg, eurozone finance ministers are discussing whether Greece has done enough to receive its next bailout tranche. There\u2019s optimism that a deal could come tonight.... City bigwigs won\u2019t be heading to Mansion House for their annual black tie shindig; the dinner has been cancelled due to the Grenfell Tower disaster. The Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has signalled he is hopeful that tonight\u2019s eurogroup meeting will produce what members of his government often like to call \u201cwhite smoke.\u201d Emerging from a tripartite summit of Greek, Israeli and Cypriot leaders in Thessaloniki, the leftist leader told the country\u2019s news agency: \u201cIn the end the good [guys] win.\u201d The cryptic sound-bite is being interpreted as the first sign of concrete optimism from the leader over Greece\u2019s debt deal. The Greek media is now reporting it is only a matter of time before the bailout review is formally wrapped up. The big question, it says, is the message euro area ministers will send to markets regarding mid-term debt relief. No signs of a breakthrough at the Greek debt talks yet... Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has ended the day down 55 points, or 0.75%, at 7419, after a downbeat session. Hundreds of millions of pounds was wiped off the value of Britain\u2019s biggest retailers, after this morning\u2019s weak retail sales figures. That included Next (-6%) and Marks &amp; Spencer (-4.5%). Traders were worried by the news that retail sales shrank by 1.2% in May, and only grew by 0.9% over the last 12 months - the weakest rise in four years. The FTSE 250 has a steeper selloff, shedding 2% or 421 to 19,553. That looks like the biggest one-day fall since last July. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says this pessimism highlights why the Bank of England shouldn\u2019t raise interest rates right now. \u2018Sentiment towards UK retailers is remarkably fragile at the moment, and any signs of a consumer squeeze are being seized upon as a reason to take a big red pen to the share prices of companies in this sector. Retailers are undoubtedly facing tough times as inflation looks set to hit household budgets, however the market\u2019s extreme response smacks of a knee-jerk reaction to one piece of retail sales data, when only a month ago these same figures were being celebrated for their resilience. Against this background the Bank of England looks out of step to be seriously considering raising interest rates, when economic data is pointing towards a consumer slowdown. Indeed the central bank has itself highlighted weaker consumer spending as a key risk to the UK economy, so now this particular chicken is coming home to roost, it\u2019s strange that the Bank of England is thinking about releasing the foxes. For the moment the balance of power still rests with the doves in the MPC however, and it\u2019s worthy of note that expectations of an interest rate rise have been confounded for many years now.\u2019 Other European markets also ended in the red: Back in the UK, Sam Hill, RBC\u2019s senior UK economist, has argued that the next UK interest rate move will be DOWN, even though three Bank of England policymakers voted to raise them today. Hill believes that slowing consumer spending is a risk to economic growth. Business spending could falter too, in the face of political uncertainty. So he believes governor Carney should highlight this uncertainty, and downplay the chances of a rate hike, when he next speaks (tonight\u2019s Mansion House speech having been cancelled, of course). Our view is that Carney should downplay the signal sent by the hawkish external members in light of the precarious position of the consumer and the uncertain post-election aftermath. Indeed, despite the vote split from the June meeting, we retain a forecast for more stimulus in Q1 2018, in the form of a Bank Rate cut to 0.1% and an additional \u00a350bn of QE Gilt buying. Over in Athens, pensioners have been holding anti-austerity protests - and sound unimpressed by the prospect of Greece finally getting its next bailout loan approved today. Helena Smith reports from the Greek capital: Today\u2019s euro group is starting on a note of optimistic with even Greece\u2019s embattled finance minister saying he is hopeful that today\u2019s proceedings will end well. But whatever emerges this evening will be far from what the increasingly embattled Greek government had in mind. As euro area finance ministers prepared for this afternoon\u2019s crucial Euro group, pensioners from across Greece gathered before the country\u2019s parliament in Syntagma square to protest against the extra cuts they now stand to suffer following legislation of additional austerity measures last month. Most, like Nikos Agnagnostopulos, were in their eighties. \u201cI came into Athens from the Peloponnese because the fight has to go on,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a builder I paid into my fund for nearly 50 years and now they have reduced my pension by 50%. With the next round there will be nothing left.\u201d Prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led coalition agreed to pre-legilsate cuts that as of 2019 will see some pensions being reduced by a further 18 percent in exchange for 7.5 bn euro in loan disbursements that single currency finance ministers are expected to sign off today. With maturing debt due next month, the tranche is vital if Greece is to, once again, avert default. But the emergency funds are a far cry from the debt relief Tsipras insists is absolutely necessary if the recession-hit Greek economy is ever to recover. \u201cAt the very least we are expecting what they agree to give us to be bigger than the forthcoming debt owed,\u201d said one Syriza MP adding that a bigger tranche would automatically stimulate the real economy. \u201cWe were told [by Tsipras] in no uncertain terms that the qui pro quo for supporting measures that went beyond those initially agreed in this [bailout] programme would be debt forgiveness. A lot of us are enraged that while we have kept to our side of the deal, they [creditors] have not kept to theirs.\u201d Ahead of the today\u2019s meeting Tsipras had urged lenders to \u201crespect the rules\u201d in op eds penned for the French daily Le Monde and German Die Welt. \u201cWe expect our lenders to respect the rules that they, themselves, came up with,\u201d he wrote. \u201c To respect my country. To respect Greece.\u201d Optimism is building that Greece and its creditors might finally reach a deal over its bailout today. The eurogroup meeting is getting underway in Luxembourg, and several ministers have expressed hopes that Athens might finally get its next aid tranche. This loan has been held back for months, as creditors demand more German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told reporters: \u201cI remain confident that we will find an agreement today on the payment of the latest tranche.\u201d However, Schauble also dampened hopes of a breakthrough on debt relief today. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire was also upbeat, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a question of goodwill and it\u2019s a question of willingness. If everyone around the table makes a very slight and positive move in the right direction we should be able to find an agreement today,\u201d The IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, is also attending the meeting: The head of the Royal Statistical Society is jubilant that UK data will no longer be released early to selected insiders. Back in March, the WSJ\u2019s Mike Bird exposed how UK government bonds moved in suspicious ways before UK data was released, suggesting that statistics were being leaked. He wrote: On average, between April 2011 and December 2016, U.K. government-bond futures correctly anticipated the rise or fall that ultimately happened when economic data were published, according to an analysis prepared for The Wall Street Journal by Alexander Kurov, associate professor of finance at West Virginia University..... Some senior British statisticians and policy makers have long feared that the U.K.\u2019s wide, early distribution of data creates a much greater risk of leaks and the potential that people could trade on data ahead of their release. For U.K. unemployment data, for instance, 118 people have prerelease access, according to the Office for National Statistics. Important news! The Office for National Statistics is stopping releasing data 24 hours early to scores of politicians and officials. From July 1, the ONS will end its current \u2018pre-access\u2019 system, which allowed early access to official surveys. This follows pressure from economists and journalists, and persistent concern that the data has been leaked to City traders who have profited by buying or selling the pound in advance. The UK\u2019s national statistician, John Pullinger, says that previous efforts to tighten early access haven\u2019t worked, so the whole system must end. Pullinger says: On the basis of all the information now available to me I consider that the public benefit likely to result from pre-release access to ONS statistics is outweighed by the detriment to public trust in those statistics likely to result from such access. Lena Komileva of G+ Economics makes a very good point. The Bank of England doesn\u2019t actually have to raise rates to influence the markets. It can make signals, and encourage investors to change their views, through a narrow vote on the MPC. She says: It is an open question as to whether either Saunders and or McCafferty would have predicted a rate hike at today\u2019s meeting had they still been in their former roles as a market and industry economist respectively. This is to say that, with monetary \u201chawks\u201d likely to remain in the minority, even in the face of a strong inflation overshoot, the importance of the wider vote split is in the market signalling, not in the probability of an actual rate hike near term. Just in: The Mansion House Dinner has been cancelled, due to the Grenfell Tower disaster. Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Economics argues that it would be a mistake to raise UK interest rates now. Via Barclays, here\u2019s a chart showing which Bank of England policymakers are hawkish, dovish, or firmly on the fence. Barclays also predicts that interest rates will remain on hold until 2019. Minutes of the meeting mention higher-than-expected core inflation and investment intentions, in addition to firming global growth and extra imported inflation stemming from the depreciation in the currency. Those MPC members who voted for a hike emphasised tighter labour market conditions and risks of a more pronounced inflation overshoot. Despite the change in vote split, we remain of the view that no interest hike will be delivered in the course of the next two years. UK chancellor Philip Hammond will not give the traditional Mansion House speech tonight, following the awful Grenfell Tower disaster. Hammond had been planning to use the speech to warn against a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the Bank appears to be running out of patience with inflation: Set against a backdrop of disappointing retail sales, slowing growth, shrinking real wages and heightened political uncertainty, it was somewhat surprising that three MPC members voted for higher rates at this week\u2019s policy meeting. Economists had expected a 7-1 split, with the soon-to-depart Kristin Forbes the lone voice calling for higher rates. In fact she was joined by Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders in believing intensifying inflationary pressures justify an immediate 25 basis point increase. It seems the willingness of the MPC to \u2018look through\u2019 higher inflation and leave rates on hold is wearing thin, and if inflation continues to surprise we could see higher rates by the end of the summer. Almost every share on the FTSE 100 is down right now. The jump in the pound has sent the FTSE 100 into a spin. The blue-chip index has tumbled by 90 points, or 1.2%, to 7383. Retailers and housebuilders are among the top fallers, along with multinationals like miners (whose share price benefits from a weak pound). This is the first time since 2011 that three MPC members have voted to raise rates (six years ago, the hawks were Andrew Sentance, Martin Weale and Spencer Dale). That was a 6-3 vote. It\u2019s also the closest vote since 2007 - when the BoE was divided 5-4. Currently there are only eight MPC members, as deputy governor Charlotte Hogg hasn\u2019t been replaced yet. So is the Bank really close to raising rates? Probably not. For starters, this is Kristin Forbes final vote on the MPC, and her successor may take a different view of the situation. It\u2019s also hard to imagine that Hogg\u2019s replacement would break ranks and oppose governor Mark Carney, who of course voted to leave rates on hold today. But few City experts predicted such a close vote today, so who knows..... The minutes of today\u2019s meeting show how the Bank of England is split between policymakers who believe inflation should be reined in, and those who believe the economy is too weak to bear higher rates. Many policymakers fear that hiking rates could crush economic growth, and that it would be better to let inflation keep climbing. As the minutes put it: Attempting to offset fully the effect of weaker sterling on inflation would be achievable only at the cost of higher unemployment and, in all likelihood, even weaker income growth. But Kristin Forbes, Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty -- three independent members of the MPC -- believe that inflation needs to be tackled, as it heads towards 3%. This is the key section of the minutes, which shows how the three hawks and five doves tussled over what to to: Overall, the degree of spare capacity in the economy appeared limited but, at the same time, the inflation overshoot relative to the target could be more pronounced than previously thought. This lessened the trade-off that the MPC was required to balance and, all else equal, reduced the MPC\u2019s tolerance of above-target inflation. The Committee discussed the appropriate response of monetary policy. Given this change in the trade-off, there were arguments in favour of a moderate tightening in monetary policy. Headline, core and some domestically focussed inflation measures had picked up further. Inflation was projected to overshoot the target by more than previously expected, and to remain above it throughout the three-year forecast period. Slack in the labour market appeared to have diminished, and demand for labour remained strong. Growth in business investment and net trade appeared on track to compensate for weaker consumption. The withdrawal of part of the stimulus that the Committee had injected in August last year would help to moderate the inflation overshoot while leaving monetary policy very supportive. But there were also arguments in favour of leaving the policy rate unchanged. A slowdown in household consumption, and GDP as a whole, had recently begun, and it was too early to judge with confidence how large and persistent it would prove to be. Although consumer confidence had held up, there had been further signs of a slowing housing market and new car registrations had fallen sharply. It was as yet unclear to what degree weaker consumption would be offset by other components of demand. A period of slower than expected growth could see a margin of slack re-opening. Wage growth had remained subdued, despite low unemployment. From the Bank of England, my colleague Katie Allen reports on today\u2019s split: The Bank of England edged closer to raising interest rates this month as a deeper split emerged among its committee of policymakers, with three of the eight voting for an immediate rate rise to keep inflation in check. The 5-3 split vote to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.25% will surprise financial markets. Most City economists had expected just one member, Kristin Forbes, would maintain her previous vote for rates to be raised to 0.5%. Instead she was joined by Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders. Their call for higher borrowing costs follows figures this week showing inflation had risen further above the Bank\u2019s target. In May inflation hit 2.9% as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), well above the Bank\u2019s 2.0% target. The May pick-up was driven in part by the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote, which has made imports to the UK more expensive. The other five members of the monetary policy committee, including Bank governor Mark Carney, felt interest rates should stay at their current low to help support growth at a time when Britons\u2019 incomes are being squeezed by rising prices and meagre wage growth. The drop in living standards has hit consumer spending and knocked overall economic growth. Figures this week showed workers were suffering the biggest squeeze on their pay since 2014. Minutes from the Bank\u2019s rate-setting meeting released on Thursday cited a range of views on the committee. They noted inflation was now expected to overshoot the Bank\u2019s target by more than previously expected. Supporting those voting for a rate rise, there were also signs that growth in business investment and net trade was on track to make up for weaker consumption. The minutes added that for some policymakers it was time to start scaling back the massive package of support launched in the wake of last summer\u2019s referendum, that included a rate cut and more electronic money printing..... The pound has jumped by almost a cent to $1.278 as traders react to the shock news that three BoE policymakers want to raise interest rates. Here we go: The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates unchanged at their current record low of 0.25%. But it\u2019s a split vote, with three policymakers voting to hike rates!! They were outvoted by five policymakers who wanted to leave interest rates unchanged. Kristen Forbes, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders are the three hawkish members who wanted to raise rates to 0.5%. This is the first time since 2011 that three MPC members have voted to raise interest rates. The MPC also left its QE stimulus programme unchanged (which means it holds \u00a3435bn of bonds). More to follow!! Retail analyst Steve Dresser sees a flock of Brexit chickens coming home to roost... It\u2019s nearly time for the Bank of England to announce its decision on interest rates, and release the minutes of this month\u2019s monetary policy committee meeting. City experts are united in expecting no change on policy at noon today - but they\u2019ll be keen to read the Bank\u2019s views on the economy, especially as inflation hit 2.9% this month. \u201cThe political chaos in Westminster, uncertainty over the UK\u2019s economic outlook and ongoing Brexit concerns\u201d are all good reasons for the Bank to leave interest rates unchanged, says FXTM Research analyst Lukman Otunuga. With the central bank highly unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy amid the instability, investors will most likely direct their attention towards Mark Carney for insights on how he plans to tackle the various challenges that the UK political climate and Brexit developments have presented. While inflation in the UK has hit a four-year high at 2.9%, wage growth remains subdued and this creates further headaches for the BoE. Although raising interest rates to cool inflation is seen as a practical strategy, it may simply end up pressuring borrowers ultimately eroding business confidence and pinching consumers further. Here\u2019s our news story on the retail sales figures: Last summer, Britons defied expectations by spending more in the shops after the Brexit vote. That trend is over, says Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, who fears that UK growth is weakening as consumers are forced to cut back. Here\u2019s his comment on today\u2019s retail sales figures: This is further evidence that the surge in consumer spending, which sustained UK economic growth since the EU referendum, has come to an end. With prices rising more rapidly, shoppers find their money does not go so far and they are therefore reining in their spending. \u201cWe should expect this subdued growth of consumer spending to continue while inflation remains around 3 percent - and there is a risk it could go even higher. The result is likely to be relatively sluggish economic growth this year and next - with GDP rising by around 1.5% in 2017 and 2018, the weakest period of growth since the euro crisis in 2011 and 2012.\u201d The weak retail sales figures have knocked the pound down by half a cent, to $1.2702. Jane Foley, top foreign exchange strategist at Rabobank, says sterling is suffering from a \u201chorrible dynamic\u201d of political uncertainty and bad economic data. She\u2019s speaking on Bloomberg TV now, saying: If you look at the economy, it is looking like it might weaken quite notably. This week we\u2019ve seen really high inflation [2.9%], weaker than expected earnings growth [1.7%], and to cap it all, very weak retail sales. The possibility of a softer Brexit is giving the pound some support, she adds, but it\u2019s not at all clear how those negotiations with the EU will pan out. This is turning into a bad morning for the UK retail sector.... The bad news for UK shoppers is that price are going to keep rising -- and their wages probably won\u2019t keep pace. Ian Gilmartin, Head of Retail &amp; Wholesale at Barclays, says retailers may have to pass on rising impost costs to customers. Inflation is really starting to kick in, with prices in the sector increasing at the highest rate for more than five years and expected to rise further. Coupled with lower wage growth, it\u2019s likely that consumer spending power will continue to weaken and it appears that retailers are going to have to navigate some choppy waters in the coming months. There are no easy solutions. With persisting currency challenges and rising supply chain costs, many retailers simply have to pass on some of this to their customers through price increases. Striking the right balance on price point between what is viable from a cost perspective and what is acceptable to the consumer is now the crucial strategic decision for retail heads to consider.\u201d Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, also blames rising inflation: \u201cThe writing has been on the wall for several months now, but May\u2019s Retail Sales figures confirm that consumer spending in the UK is finally slowing down. There\u2019s no mystery whatsoever about what the cause is: inflation is biting into household budgets. With prices set to rise further, it\u2019s likely the slowdown seen in May will continue. Here\u2019s another retail sales chart, highlighting how UK consumers spend more in the shops in May but got rather less. The ONS says price hikes are hitting sales volumes. Increases in average store prices may explain this slowdown. Food stores saw the biggest increase in prices since November 2013 and non-food stores the biggest increase since October 2011.

Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: UK consumers will remain under the cosh for some time as inflation pushes higher, warns Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. Here\u2019s his take on the UK retail sales slowdown: May\u2019s retail sales relapse points to increasingly squeezed consumers again reining in their spending after a temporary loosening of the purse strings in April Retail sales figures dilute hopes that consumer spending will make a significantly improved contribution to GDP growth in the second quarter after a sharp first-quarter slowdown With inflation poised to move above 3% imminently and earnings growth weak, there looks to be more pain to come for consumers. Economists and City traders are alarmed by the weak UK retail sales last month. Alan Clarke of Scotia Bank says we should focus on the 0.9% annual rise in sales volumes - the weakest rise in four years - rather than the 1.2% month-on-month slump. He writes: Since late-2016, the growth rate has slumped from over 6% y/y to below 1% y/y currently. That is exactly what should have happened given the unpleasant cocktail of: - slower employment growth; - slower wage inflation; and - much higher CPI inflation. There is plenty more where that came from. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets blames the surge in inflation, due to the slump in the pound since last June\u2019s EU referendum. The retail sales data out of the UK was trashy and it shows how reluctant the consumers have become in terms of their spending. Consumer spending has been feeble and wage growth is lacklustre also as it was confirmed by the average earning index data yesterday. Investors have been feeling the pinch due to the higher inflation, the concussion of Brexit. Rupert Seggins points out that the retail sales figures have been choppy since last summer. Mizuho Bank are also concerned that Brexit is now hurting the UK economy: Breaking: Retail sales volumes across the UK plunged by 1.2% in May as inflation bites deeper into household budgets. This is a deeper fall than the 0.8% decline expected, and will fuel worries that the UK economy is faltering. It means that retail sales were only 0.9% higher than a year ago - the weakest rise since April 2013! The Office for National Statistic blames rising prices (inflation jumped to 2.9% in May). Ole Black, ONS Senior Statistician says: \u201cThe year-on-year growth in the quantity bought for retail sales in May 2017 was at 0.9%. We have not seen lower growth on the year since April 2013. Increased retail prices across all sectors seem to be a significant factor in slowing growth.\u201d Volumes of all item types fell in May, apart for petrol. If you strip out fuel sales, then retail sales fell by 1.6% in the month. This chart show the full impact of inflation -- Britons spent 4.1% more in the shops than last year, but only took 0.9% more stuff home with them. European stock markets have all lost ground this morning, as traders digest last night\u2019s US interest rate hike. The French and Spanish markets are leading the way, down almost 1%. Investors aren\u2019t surprised that the Federal Reserve hiked borrowing costs - last night\u2019s rate hike was priced in. But they are a little disconcerted that Fed chair Janet Yellen sounder quite hawkish; sweeping aside concerns about low inflation, and predicting that the employment market would keep recovering. Clear Treasury say: The overriding theme we took from the meeting is that Yellen is planning to plough ahead with normalising Monetary policy despite recent inflation as she bets that the ongoing strength of the labour market will ultimately prevail. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx is also concerned by DFS\u2019s profits warning: DFS Furniture looked pretty damn tatty this Thursday, the stock plunging 22% to trade below \u00a32 for the first time since the aftermath of last year\u2019s Brexit referendum. The retailer blamed the \u2018uncertain macroeconomic environment\u2019, in part linked to the chaos of the UK general election, for the substantial drop in demand, going on to state that it believes the issues are \u2018market-wide\u2019. It is going to be interesting in the coming weeks to see how much of an effect the current political landscape and, of course, rapidly shrinking wages, has had on the UK retail sector\u2019s second quarter. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is down 0.6%, or 45 points, in early trading as shares in retailers fall. And here\u2019s the DFS tumble again: DFS\u2019s profit warning has sent shares in other retailers sliding too. That includes high street group Next (down 3.3%), DIY chain Kingfisher (down 2.5%) and joinery group Howdens (down 5%). They\u2019d all be vulnerable if consumers really are cutting back on spending. [Next have also just been downgrade by Credit Suisse] Rival sofamaker SCS has slumped by 10%, as traders deduce that it could also be suffering. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says DFS\u2019s woes are a sign of larger problems in the economy. Undoubtedly the uncertainty around the general election and Brexit means people are delaying big ticket purchases. The relative resilience of the UK in the six months after the referendum, and comparative slowing thereafter, seems to be mirrored in the fortunes of DFS. Retail analyst Nick Bubb adds: We have been noting for a while now that the Electricals market has been quite weak and now the cloud over \u201cbig ticket\u201d retailers has increased, with DFS warning that they have seen \u201csignificant declines in store footfall leading to a material reduction in customer orders\u201d in recent months. Ouch! Britain\u2019s biggest sofa chain has just hit the City with a profits warning, sending its shares tanking. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: DFS Furniture told shareholders that it had suffered a big drop in customer orders as the retail environment weakened more than it had expected. DFS said customers were holding off buying furniture generally because of the uncertainty caused by last week\u2019s general election and the macroeconomic environment - hinting at last summer\u2019s Brexit vote. This means 2017 profits will miss City forecasts, DFS warned. It now estimates Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) at \u00a382m-\u00a387m, down from City forecasts of around \u00a395m. Shares have plunged by over a fifth in early trading to a 11-month low, from 252p to 198p. Quite a reduction! Demand for big-ticket items such as sofas often fall when economic conditions worsen, so this could be another sign that consumers are reining in their spending - especially now that real wages are falling. Garry White of stockbrokers Charles Stanley isn\u2019t completely convinced by DFS\u2019s excuses: Not sure what \u2018bullocks\u2019 have to do with it. Maybe Garry is thinking of DFS\u2019s range of leather sofas..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There lots to keep the City busy today, with Britain\u2019s central bank and Greece\u2019s debt talks jostling for attention. After the Federal Reserve raised interest rates last night, it\u2019s the Bank of England\u2019s turn to set monetary policy. The City expect that the Bank will vote 7-1 to leave interest rates unchanged,. The Bank\u2019s latest view on the UK economy will be pored over \u2013 especially as last week\u2019s general election has plunged us into a deep political crisis. New retail sales figures are released this morning too, which are expected to show that consumers cut back last month. RBC Capital Markets say: Retail sales volumes in May are expected to reveal a decline versus April, where the outturn was particularly strong as a result of good weather during the month which contained Easter. The great and the good of the City will be ironing their best shirts tonight, for the annual Mansion House speech. Chancellor Philip Hammond is the star turn, and will use his speech to argue for a Brexit that\u2019s good for business. In the eurozone, Greece will make one more push to persuade its creditors that it\u2019s done enough to unlock fresh aid funds. Eurozone finance ministers will meet this afternoon, to discuss whether Greece has delivered on its austerity targets, and should receive its next loan. The situation is now getting quite tense; Athens faces debt repayments in July, and prime minister Alexis Tsipras is already talking about the need for a \u2018political solution\u2019 to be hammered out by eurozone leaders. Germany, though, wants to leave it in the finance ministers\u2019 court. The real prize, of course, is debt reduction - but Greece\u2019s creditors are struggling to agree on what needs to be done to make its debts sustainable. So it could be another frustrating Eurogroup meeting. Here\u2019s the agenda: 9.30am BST: UK retail sales for May 10am BST: Eurozone trade figures for April 12pm BST: Bank of England decision on interest rates 12pm BST: Bank of England publishes minutes of today\u2019s meeting 2pm BST: Eurogroup meeting begins in Luxembourg 9pm BST: Mansion House speeches",

Payment of the latest tranche of Greece\u2019s 86-billion euro ($97-billion) has been held up for months by a row over its needs for debt relief pitting bailout-weary Germany against the IMF.  \u201cI am pleased to announce we have achieved an agreement on all elements,\u201d Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem told a news conference.  \u201cI think this is a major step forward,\u201d he said.  In a breakthrough, Lagarde agreed in Luxembourg that the Washington-based IMF would join Greece\u2019s massive bailout, but said any payouts depended on the eurozone coming up with a full debt relief plan.  \u201cNobody claims that this is the best solution. This is a second best solution, but it\u2019s not a bad solution,\u201d said Lagarde, a former French finance minister.

The Committee discussed the appropriate response of monetary policy.</p> <p><strong>Given this change in the trade-off, there were arguments in favour of a moderate tightening in monetary policy.</strong> Headline, core and some domestically focussed inflation measures had picked up further. Inflation was projected to overshoot the target by more than previously expected, and to remain above it throughout the three-year forecast period. Slack in the labour market appeared to have diminished, and demand for labour remained strong. Growth in business investment and net trade appeared on track to compensate for weaker consumption. The withdrawal of part of the stimulus that the Committee had injected in August last year would help to moderate the inflation overshoot while leaving monetary policy very supportive.</p> <p><strong>But there were also arguments in favour of leaving the policy rate unchanged.</strong> A slowdown in household consumption, and GDP as a whole, had recently begun, and it was too early to judge with confidence how large and persistent it would prove to be. Although consumer confidence had held up, there had been further signs of a slowing housing market and new car registrations had fallen sharply. It was as yet unclear to what degree weaker consumption would be offset by other components of demand. A period of slower than expected growth could see a margin of slack re-opening.

Most City economists had expected just one member, Kristin Forbes, would maintain her previous vote for rates to be raised to 0.5%.

The May pick-up was driven in part by the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote, which has made imports to the UK more expensive.</p> <p>The other five members of the monetary policy committee, including Bank governor Mark Carney, felt interest rates should stay at their current low to help support growth at a time when Britons\u2019 incomes are being squeezed by rising prices and meagre wage growth. The drop in living standards has hit consumer spending and knocked overall economic growth. Figures this week showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/14/pay-squeeze-wages-growth-inflation-ons-unemployment-rate\">workers were suffering the biggest squeeze on their pay since 2014</a>.</p> <p>Minutes from the Bank\u2019s rate-setting meeting released on Thursday cited a range of views on the committee. They noted inflation was now expected to overshoot the Bank\u2019s target by more than previously expected. Supporting those voting for a rate rise, there were also signs that growth in business investment and net trade was on track to make up for weaker consumption.</p> <p> The minutes added that for some policymakers it was time to start scaling back the massive package of support launched in the wake of last summer\u2019s referendum, that included a rate cut and more electronic money printing.....</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-594269d6e4b0d5ab311e7f9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-15T11:09:23.308Z\">12.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The pound has jumped by almost a cent to $1.278 as traders react to the shock news that three BoE policymakers want to raise interest rates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/neilwilson_etx/status/875307228449976320\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sterling pops on BoE vote <a href=\"https://t.co/YZ5iMWshym\">pic.twitter.com/YZ5iMWshym</a></p>&mdash; Neil Wilson (@neilwilson_etx) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neilwilson_etx/status/875307228449976320\">June 15, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Birdyword/status/875307438106345473\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Jump in sterling on 5-3 vote at BOE against a rate hike. 7-1 vote was expected. <a href=\"https://t.co/ZEoVHItLip\">pic.twitter.com/ZEoVHItLip</a></p>&mdash; Mike Bird (@Birdyword) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Birdyword/status/875307438106345473\">June 15, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-06-15T11:09:42.931Z\">at 12.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-594267e0e4b014a733d62709\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-15T11:02:28.939Z\">12.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">SPLIT at the Bank of England!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here we go: The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates unchanged at their current record low of 0.25%.</strong></p> <p>But it\u2019s a split vote, with three policymakers voting to hike rates!!

      "bodyText": "Greece is on track to receive vital bailout funds, after its international creditors narrowed their differences in a long-running dispute about the country\u2019s vast debt mountain. Eurozone finance ministers appeared ready on Thursday to unlock \u20ac8.5bn (\u00a37.4bn) from the Greek \u20ac86bn bailout fund to help Athens make a repayment due in July, although specifics on long-term debt relief are likely to be fudged. The disbursement ends months of deadlock between Greece\u2019s creditors, but is unlikely to diminish fears that the recession-ravaged country faces years of austerity. Eurozone officials advised ministers meeting on Thursday to offer \u20ac8.5bn, an EU source told Reuters in Luxembourg. That amount would exceed earlier proposals. After months of delay, the eurozone indicated it was ready to release the funds, as the International Monetary Fund appeared to back down over its refusal to get involved \u2013 a point that had blocked further loans. The Washington-based IMF had refused to take part in this third Greek bailout until European creditors agreed on far-reaching proposals to ease Greece\u2019s debt burden. Germany had led resistance to further moves on debt relief, but blocked releasing this latest money without the IMF on board. After months of dispute, the IMF director, Christine Lagarde, suggested last week the fund could get involved \u201cin principle\u201d but would not pledge any of its own money until the end of the current bailout programme in 2018. The IMF contribution to Greek bailout coffers is expected to be limited, but European governments see the IMF as a tough broker that will push Athens for reforms and lend the country\u2019s bailout electoral credibility. Having the IMF on board is seen as a litmus test for the Bundestag, which has to approve loans to Greece. Hopes of a breakthrough rose when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin said she was confident Greece would \u201cbe rewarded for its efforts\u201d. Arriving for the talks in Luxembourg, the Greek finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, summed up his feelings tersely: \u201cOptimistic\u201d, he said. Greece\u2019s leftwing government, which has pushed through unpopular pension cuts and tax increases to secure the funds, is very likely to be disappointed that it is still waiting on a specific number on debt relief. Although the economy is growing again, more than one third of Greeks are estimated to be at risk of poverty. Eurozone ministers were expected to stop short of naming a figure for measures to ease Greece\u2019s debt burden, which totals \u20ac314bn \u2013 or 180% of economic output. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a figure that rolls out,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who is the Eurogroup president. \u201cThe figure will only come at the end of the programme.\u201d Despite detente between the creditors, the IMF and the eurozone are expected to remain at odds over the long-term prospects for the Greek economy. IMF officials do not believe EU assumptions that Greece can run a budget surplus (minus debt servicing) of 3.5% for years to come. The IMF wants to the terms of the Greek debt to be eased, by extending repayment holidays and deadlines. Creditors agreed on short-term debt relief last year, but the IMF had been pressing for specifics on the long-term. It has previously warned that Greece\u2019s debts could spiral to 250% of GDP by 2050 without help. Before the meeting on Thursdays, the creditors sounded optimistic about reaching a deal, while Greek sources warned that an agreement was hanging in the balance. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, told his cabinet he would take the problem to an EU leaders\u2019 summit next week if there was no agreement.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A worse-than-expected decline in retail sales volumes has sparked the biggest daily fall in the FTSE 250 since last summer, with shares in retailers, housebuilders, restaurant chains and car dealers all going into reverse. The index lost 2.1% after the grim retail data was published. Sales volumes fell by 1.2% in May\u2013 their slowest rate for four years \u2013 as rising prices caused consumers to tighten their belts. Economists had expected a 0.8% month-on-month decline. The fall means retail sales were 0.9% higher than a year ago \u2013 the weakest rise since April 2013. The signs of distress included shoppers trading down from branded groceries to cheaper own label and more visits to discount food retailers. About \u00a39bn was wiped off the value of the FTSE 250 companies. The index is a better proxy for the health of the UK economy than the FTSE 100. The slowdown in spending by consumers will fuel worries that the UK economy is entering a period of sluggish growth. In April sales surged to an eight-month high, though this was seen as a blip in a longer-term trend for shoppers to tighten their belts. The Office for National Statistics blamed the steep rise in the annual rate of inflation over the last year to 2.9% in May, up from just 0.3% in May 2016. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cMay\u2019s retail sales figures confirm that consumers are struggling to spend more now that real wages are falling at the fastest rate for three years.\u201d It was difficult to see the trend in retail sales improving soon, he said. \u201cRetailers have not finished yet passing on higher import prices to consumers, wage growth looks set to remain depressed and banks are reporting that they intend to restrict the supply of unsecured credit,\u201d he added. \u201cAs a result, we expect quarter-on-quarter growth in households\u2019 real spending to average just 0.2% in the remaining three quarters of 2017, ensuring that the overall economy continues to struggle.\u201d The ONS said average store prices increased by 2.8% tracking the overall inflation rate, illustrating the decision of most retailers to pass on at least some of the increased cost of imports to consumers. After the EU referendum vote last year the pound plunged by almost a quarter, dramatically increasing the cost of imported goods. While shops have absorbed some of the extra cost, many have passed on some in the form of higher prices. Keith Richardson, managing director retail sector at Lloyds bank\u2019s commercial banking arm, said hopes for a post-election bounce appear to have been dashed, with further political uncertainty potentially damaging consumer confidence. \u201cIn reality, we can see that shoppers are actually tightening their belts, switching to supermarkets\u2019 own-brand products, while the discounters are also enjoying renewed growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re also prioritising their spending, with non-food sales suffering so that consumers can still afford to put a treat in the trolley when buying their groceries. \u201cBut while it might benefit grocers to see people eating in instead of going out, other parts of the high street are less fortunate as fewer nights out will mean fewer new outfits and so on. Whichever way you look at it, this is shaping up to be another difficult year for certain parts of the retail world.\u201d The slump in retail sales, combined with the profit warning from sofa chain, has seen shares in the sector drop back sharply, with Next, Marks &amp; Spencer and Kingfisher all down more than 3%.",

      "bodyText": "The annual Mansion House dinner for City grandees planned for Thursday night, due to include high-profile speeches by the chancellor and governor of the Bank of England, has been cancelled following the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower in west London. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, postponed his speech after concluding it would be inappropriateat this time to address the hundreds of bankers, fund managers and policymakers at the black-tie dinner. He had been expected to use his first annual address at the City event to call for a more \u201cbusiness-friendly\u201d approach to Brexit. The City of London Corporation announced that the event was being cancelled, almost an hour after the chancellor tweeted that he would not deliver his much-anticipated speech. Hammond tweeted that he was pulling out just as prime minister Theresa May was announcing a full public inquiry into the fire in the 24-storey tower block in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea where 17 people are known to have died. Many more people remain missing. The prime minister and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, have visited the site of the fire. At the Mansion House event, Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, was expected to talk to the audience about the importance of international trade, just days before the start of Brexit talks next week. Hammond had been expected to warn against the dangers of a hard Brexit and, according to reports, to urge the prime minister to put the economy at the heart of the EU exit talks. The lord mayor of London, Andrew Parmley, had been planning to discuss the importance of Brexit, calling for a bespoke agreement with the EU to ensure the financial sector would thrive after the UK left. A City of London Corporation spokesperson said: \u201cIn the light of the tragedy at Grenfell Tower we are cancelling tonight\u2019s Mansion House dinner. Our thoughts are focused with the victims and their families and friends.\u201d The Bank of England said: \u201cOut of respect to the victims, families and friends of all those affected by the Grenfell Tower tragedy, the Mansion House dinner has been cancelled this evening. The governor\u2019s speech will be given in due course.\u201d Last year, Hammond\u2019s predecessor, George Osborne, had to alter the speech he had intended to deliver following the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox. The Mansion House dinner is the biggest event that takes place in the 250-year-old building, which is the official residence of the mayor during the year in office. The chairs and CEOs of all the big banks usually attend. Known as the bankers\u2019 and merchants\u2019 dinner, it is an event noted for its pomp and ceremony. High-profile guests are clapped as they proceed to the top table and there are a number of traditional toasts. The cancellation of the dinner is thought to be the first in at least 35 years. The food due to be consumed at the event is understood to have been donated to a local fire station on the advice of the British Red Cross.",

      "bodyText": "The economy is looking wobbly. Living standards are being squeezed. A week after the general election Britain lacks an effective government. Is this the right time for the Bank of England to be thinking about raising interest rates? Well, three members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee think it is \u2013 the first time there has been a triumvirate in favour of dearer borrowing costs in six years. Kristin Forbes, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders \u2013 the trio who voted for a quarter-point increase in interest rates to 0.5% \u2013 have a case, as the minutes of the latest MPC meeting show. Inflation stands at 2.9%, well above the government\u2019s 2% target and higher than the Bank anticipated in its May inflation report. Inflation is heading above 3%, at which point the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, will have to write an explanatory letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond. The continued fall in unemployment also meant a tighter labour market and, although the weak pound has put the brakes on consumer spending by making imports dearer, the other side of the coin is that a more competitive currency is helping exports and encouraging businesses to invest. The MPC hawks made the point that the Bank cut rates by a quarter-point to boost the economy after the shock result of the EU referendum last summer, and that given the better than anticipated growth and employment performance since there was now an argument for removing that part of the emergency stimulus package. Even so, there are three reasons why interest rates are unlikely to go up any time soon. The first is that it was the last MPC meeting for one of the hawks,Forbes, whose three-year term ends at the end of the month. The second is that we have been here before. On frequent occasions since the rates were cut to their then record low of 0.5% in early 2009 there has been a dissenting faction on the MPC calling for higher rates. Eventually, either the weakness of the economy or the weakness of inflation \u2013 and sometimes both \u2013 has forced them to back off. The third is that the state of the economy favours the five MPC doves. Households are spending less, the housing market is weak, new car registrations have plunged and wage growth has fallen back, even though more people are in jobs. On balance, the arguments in favour of leaving rates where they are look more compelling than the arguments for raising them. No question, though, that the announcement of the 5-3 vote took the City by surprise and led to a stronger pound \u2013 if only briefly \u2013 on the foreign exchanges. What the Bank would really like would be a situation where the threat of higher rates leads to a firmer currency, lower import prices and weaker inflation. That would obviate the need for an actual rate increase.",

Inflation is heading above 3%, at which point the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, will have to write an explanatory letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/15/bank-of-england-uk-interest-rates-inflation\">Bank of England edges closer to increasing UK interest rates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The continued fall in unemployment also meant a tighter labour market and, although the weak pound has put the brakes on consumer spending by making imports dearer, the other side of the coin is that a more competitive currency is helping exports and encouraging businesses to invest.</p> <p>The MPC hawks made the point that the Bank cut rates by a quarter-point to boost the economy after the shock result of the EU referendum last summer, and that given the better than anticipated growth and employment performance since there was now an argument for removing that part of the emergency stimulus package.</p> <p>Even so, there are three reasons why interest rates are unlikely to go up any time soon. The first is that it was the last MPC meeting for one of the hawks,Forbes, whose three-year term ends at the end of the month.</p> <p>The second is that we have been here before. On frequent occasions since the rates were cut to their then record low of 0.5% in early 2009 there has been a dissenting faction on the MPC calling for higher rates. Eventually, either the weakness of the economy or the weakness of inflation \u2013 and sometimes both \u2013 has forced them to back off.</p> <p>The third is that the state of the economy favours the five MPC doves. Households are spending less, the housing market is weak, new car registrations have plunged and wage growth has fallen back, even though more people are in jobs.</p> <p>On balance, the arguments in favour of leaving rates where they are look more compelling than the arguments for raising them. No question, though, that the announcement of the 5-3 vote took the City by surprise and led to a stronger pound \u2013 if only briefly \u2013 on the foreign exchanges. What the Bank would really like would be a situation where the threat of higher rates leads to a firmer currency, lower import prices and weaker inflation. That would obviate the need for an actual rate increase. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The system meltdown that left 75,000 British Airways passengers stranded at the start of the May half-term holiday cost the airline \u00a380m, shareholders have been told. At the annual meeting in Madrid of BA\u2019s parent company, IAG,Willie Walsh gave the airline\u2019s first assessment of the fiasco\u2019s gross cost, including rebooking and compensating passengers and restoring lost luggage. Walsh, the IAG chief executive, said the group would continue to update shareholders on the bill. He said the power failure led to BA cancelling 726 flights , 28% of scheduled flights over three days. Walsh apologised again for the incident, adding: \u201cI know it was a dreadful experience for many of our customers.\u201d But he continued to praise BA bosses and rejected any link to decisions to outsource IT and other jobs. He said that while they awaited the results of an independent investigation into the power failure at BA\u2019s primary centre on 27 May, \u201cwhat we do know is that the failure had absolutely nothing to do with the way we resourced IT\u201d. Walsh credited the contractors and BA staff with an \u201coutstanding achievement\u201d to restore services, adding: \u201cDespite major operational problems, by 29 May it was able to run the majority of its schedule.\u201d IAG has already attributed the cause of the crisis to an error by a technician who cut the power and restored it \u201cin an uncontrolled manner\u201d. Walsh\u2019s praise was matched by the IAG chairman, Antonio V\u00e1zquez Romero, who said: \u201cIt is only right to recognise the efforts of the BA team and the efficiency with which they restored operations.\u201d He promised they would \u201cdo everything to restore customers\u2019 faith\u201d. Romero said the last year had seen \u201cvery difficult circumstances\u201d for the airline group, with the Brexit vote and subsequent collapse of the pound hitting profits. IAG is heavily dependent on BA\u2019s sterling revenues, but major costs such as fuel and aircraft are paid in dollars, while the group reports in euros. Despite the currency fall having a \u20ac460m (\u00a3402m) adverse impact, IAG made \u20ac2.53bn in pre-tax profits and Romero said: \u201cOur long-term financial goals remain practically unchanged [by Brexit]\u201d. He added: \u201cOur commitment to adequately remunerating our shareholders is unwavering.\u201d Almost \u20ac500m in dividends was paid out last year. Walsh said IAG would continue to expand in low-cost, long-haul flying after \u201can incredible customer response\u201d to the launch of its new airline brand Level in Spain last month, with 52,000 tickets sold in the first 12 hours of sale. Walsh also took the opportunity to attack the proposals for a third runway at Heathrow. He said it was \u201ca great opportunity for IAG \u2013 but the cost of new infrastructure must not be paid for by consumers\u201d. He added that the airport\u2019s \u00a317.6bn price tag was \u201cunacceptable... and would definitely mean hiked prices for consumers\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Thames Water is the company that gives even doubters cause to wonder whether renationalisation of the water industry might be a good idea. Ownership of the operating business, and the finer details of the colossal \u00a310.75bn of debt financing, is contained within a labyrinth of intermediary offshore companies that makes it impossible to calculate how much the owners have made over the years. All one can reasonably observe is that even insiders concede Australian financial outfit Macquarie made a packet in the period before it sold its final stake this year. The splendid rewards, whatever they are, might arouse less suspicion if Thames did a better job for its customers. But here comes another financial penalty. This one, for \u00a38.5m, is for leaking water at a rate regulator Ofwat called \u201cunacceptable\u201d. It follows a \u00a320.3m fine in March for pumping huge quantities of untreated sewage into the river Thames. The judge in that case called the company\u2019s behaviour \u201cborderline deliberate\u201d and said the \u201cunprecedented pollution incidents\u201d were avoidable if Thames had been open in its dealings with the Environment Agency. The only semi-cheerful news is that the directors of Thames Water seem to recognise that the company\u2019s bunker-like approach to dealing with outsiders\u2019 scepticism has to end. The annual report contained a mass of phrases like \u201ca fresh perspective\u201d, \u201ca new chapter\u201d and \u201cdriving change\u201d. One awaits the results but, to be fair to new-ish chief executive Steve Robertson, his pledges about transparency sound more sincere than those of some of his predecessors. Yet you do wonder why it has taken a semi-crisis at Thames to force the first sign of cultural change and new thinking. Was an overhaul impossible while Macquarie was the dominant shareholder? Is that why chairman Sir Peter Mason is keen to point out in the annual report that \u201cmore than two-thirds of our shareholders now represent pension funds\u201d? It\u2019s hard to know but two facts seem clear enough. First, about \u00a31.2bn has been taken out of Thames in the form of dividends in the past 10 years. Second, the fines and penalties, even when set at maximums, appear tiny in the context of \u00a3634m of operating profits last year. That is why the perception remains that Thames has been milked by owners with a sharper sense than Ofwat of the financial risks and rewards of owning a water company. Nationalisation isn\u2019t obviously a good answer because the upfront costs would be enormous and investment funding would probably be less secure under public ownership. But it\u2019s fair to ask whether Ofwat could push a lot harder on behalf of customers. The National Audit Office had a crack in 2015 and deemed profits in the industry to be excessive. MPs in the new parliament should have another go. It would be easier \u2013 and cheaper \u2013 to beef up the regulatory system than to buy an entire industry. The trouble with Jacob Andrew Tyrie will be a hard act to follow as chairman of the Treasury select committee, as said here when the Conservative MP for Chichester announced his retirement from parliament before the election. The Treasury committee is the most important of them all, and Tyrie \u2013 as well as getting under the skin of errant bankers, financial regulators and Bank of England officials \u2013 was on top of the detail. He did as much as anyone to drive through the post-crisis reforms to the banking sector. So who will replace him? Jacob Rees-Mogg has declared himself to be a runner. One could say he\u2019s qualified in three ways. First, he was a member of the committee in the last parliament \u2013 he was one of its spikier members. Second, he\u2019s a Tory and the chair of the Treasury committee is traditionally chosen from the governing party. Third, one shouldn\u2019t be fooled by the gentlemanly demeanour: Rees-Mogg knows how to dig for detail since he made a lot of money as a founder of fund manager Somerset Capital Management. But there\u2019s an obvious drawback with Rees-Mogg\u2019s candidacy. He is a high-profile and a committed campaigner for Brexit, the issue that will dominate the committee\u2019s work in the next two years. The firm Brexit school of thought plainly needs to be represented on the committee. But the chairman also needs to be able to marshall a consensus on occasions. If Rees-Mogg is set in his view that Brexit will be a \u201cwonderful liberation\u201d, he may simply be too partisan and dogmatic for the chairman\u2019s role. No MP is even entirely open-minded (it would be odd if they were) but Tyrie gave the appearance that he was happy to take a pop at anybody. It was one of his best assets.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has edged closer to raising interest rates as a deeper split emerged among its committee of policymakers, with three out of eight voting for an immediate rise to keep inflation in check. The 5-3 split to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.25% surprised financial markets and the pound rose against the dollar on the news. Most City economists had expected a larger majority of the committee to opt to keep borrowing costs low to ease the pressure on households from a drop in living standards in the wake of last summer\u2019s Brexit vote. It was the committee\u2019s widest split since May 2011. The financial markets had expected just one policymaker, Kristin Forbes, to maintain her previous vote for a rate rise to 0.5%. In the event she was joined by Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders. Their call for higher borrowing costs follows a rise in inflation to even further above the Bank\u2019s 2.0% target. Data released on Tuesday showed that in May inflation hit 2.9%, driven in part by the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote, which has made imports to the UK more expensive. The pound got some support on Thursday from the prospect of higher interest rates but at $1.276 it is still down 14% against the dollar when compared with the night of the EU referendum a year ago. The pound\u2019s loss has been the FTSE 100\u2019s gain, however, as weaker sterling has flattered the earnings of the many companies on the stock index that make money overseas. The FTSE fell after the Bank decision was announced and it closed down 55 points, or 0.7%, at 7419.36. Since the Brexit vote the Bank\u2019s committee of rate-setters has been forced into a balancing act between keeping import-fuelled inflation in check and providing support to the economy as uncertainty and a squeeze on incomes bites. The five policymakers voting to leave interest rates on hold at June\u2019s meeting, including the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, appeared to be more worried about a slowdown in consumer spending as households grapple with rising prices and meagre wage growth. Those factors have dented overall growth and left the UK economy trailing behind the world\u2019s other advanced economies and all its European neighbours in the opening months of 2017. Minutes from the Bank\u2019s rate-setting meeting released on Thursday cited a range of views on the MPC. They noted inflation was now expected to overshoot the Bank\u2019s target by more than previously expected. Supporting those voting for a rate rise, there were also signs that growth in business investment and net trade was on track to make up for weaker consumption. The minutes added that some policymakers felt it was time to start scaling back the massive package of support launched after last summer\u2019s EU referendum, which included a rate cut and more electronic money printing. \u201cBut there were also arguments in favour of leaving the policy rate unchanged,\u201d they added. \u201cA slowdown in household consumption, and GDP as a whole, had recently begun, and it was too early to judge with confidence how large and persistent it would prove to be.\u201d All committee members agreed any rate rises would likely be at a gradual pace and \u201cto a limited extent\u201d. One seat on the committee was empty \u2013 the result of Charlotte Hogg\u2019s resignation as deputy governor after it emerged she had breached the Bank\u2019s code of conduct. Forbes leaves the MPC later this month and investors are awaiting an announcement on her replacement. Policymakers will provide a fuller update on their thinking when they release quarterly economic forecasts and vote again on interest rates in August. James Knightley, a senior economist at the bank ING, said he still expected a majority of policymakers to tolerate higher inflation in favour of shoring up the economy. \u201cThe economic and political uncertainty, we believe, is too great to get a consensus behind higher rates and with Kristin Forbes leaving the BoE this month, the hurdle to getting that consensus will soon be harder to achieve,\u201d he said. But Ben Brettell, senior economist at financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown said policymakers appeared to be more optimistic than many economists about the UK\u2019s prospects. \u201cIt seems the willingness of the MPC to \u2018look through\u2019 higher inflation and leave rates on hold is wearing thin, and if inflation continues to surprise we could see higher rates by the end of the summer,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s car insurers suffered combined losses of \u00a33.5bn last year due to controversial new compensation rules for serious injuries, according to a report which predicts further sharp rises in insurance premiums, especially for young drivers. Consultancy EY said the new Ogden formula led to significant underwriting losses for the motor insurance market in 2016. The unexpectedly deep cut in the Ogden rate, from 2.5% to -0.75%, prompted a furious backlash from insurers who claim that it will \u201covercompensate\u201d victims of car crashes or medical errors in hospitals. Although the change to the discount rate was announced in February, most insurers reflected the impact on outstanding claims in their 2016 figures. EY estimates the overall cost of the Ogden rate change to insurers and reinsurers at \u00a33.5bn. About \u00a32.4bn of these losses have been disclosed so far, with Admiral one of the worst hit. Its 2016 pretax profits were reduced by \u00a3105m, falling by a quarter to \u00a3284.3m. However, the NHS and other parts of the public sector such as the armed forces are set to take an even bigger hit, of nearly \u00a36bn. The first case settled under the new Ogden rate in late March forced an NHS trust to nearly triple its payout to a 10-year-old girl left with cerebral palsy from \u00a33.8m to \u00a39.3m. UK car insurance rates hit record highs between January and March, totalling \u00a3462bn, according to the Association of British Insurers. Rising claims costs due to the new Ogden rate and the rise in insurance premium tax to 12% from this month could push premiums up by a further 9% in 2017 to \u00a3503bn, EY predicts. This will add \u00a328 to the average cost of a comprehensive policy. Tony Sault, the UK general insurance market lead at EY, said: \u201cFurther effects will be felt next year when annual reinsurance cover for large claims come up for renewal. Young drivers will undoubtedly have to bear the brunt of the increase due to the disproportionate number of larger claims they cause. A fundamental review of Ogden and the government\u2019s proposed whiplash reforms are increasingly urgent for consumers and must not be abandoned in the aftermath of the general election.\u201d He said there could be some respite for insurers if the promised whiplash reforms and a review of the Ogden methodology materialise.",

      "bodyText": "A former director of Barclays Bank who has also worked as a financial regulator has been appointed City minister by Theresa May. Steve Barclay, who backed the Vote Leave campaign, takes over the brief for the financial district at a time when other cities across the EU are aiming to grab business from the City after Brexit. On Tuesday, Brussels outlined plans that could strip London of its coveted role in clearing financial assets denominated in euros amid warnings this could threaten 100,000 jobs across the UK. Big banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have also said they would shift jobs out of London in response to Brexit. The MP for North East Cambridgeshire, who was first elected in 2010, has the formal title of economic secretary to the Treasury and replaces Simon Kirby, who lost his seat in last week\u2019s election and had faced criticism while in the role. Barclay, according to his website, qualified as a solicitor before working in financial regulation and then financial crime prevention. He was director of regulatory affairs and then head of anti-money laundering and sanctions in the high street banking operations of Barclays. Before Barclays he had worked at the City regulator, the Financial Services Authority, and has previously said that attempts to clean up the financial sector from money laundering were flawed. In 2014, Barclay said: \u201cWhen there is a high-risk multimillion-pound transaction, the bank files a suspicious activity report, but 93% of the reports are never read.\u201d It is not yet clear what Barclay\u2019s remit will be at the Treasury. His predecessor was sidelined in March from overseeing Brexit\u2019s impact on financial services, when the task was handed to Lucy Neville-Rolfe, who tweeted on Tuesday that she had left the government. But Barclay gave a clue to his approach to his new role. Responding to a tweet congratulating him on his appointment the new City minister said: Miles Celic, the chief executive of lobby group TheCityUK, welcomed his appointment. \u201cIt is vital we have more champions of business representing our industry in parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we begin the Brexit negotiations, it will be essential for the government and industry to maintain a strong, open and constructive dialogue. \u201cThis includes remaining focused on effective bridging and adaptation periods to allow for a smooth, orderly Brexit, mutual market access based on mutual recognition and regulatory cooperation, and the ability to access and supply the best global talent.\u201d Chris Cummings, the chief executive of the Investment Association, said: \u201cAs the UK enters the Brexit negotiations, it has never been more important for the City to have a minister who really understands and champions its needs.\u201d Barclay will be one of the ministers working in the Treasury under Philip Hammond, who is due to give the chancellor\u2019s annual Mansion House address on Thursday. Hammond\u2019s audience of bankers will be looking for signs of any softening of the government\u2019s stance towards Brexit. A replacement for Lady Neville-Rolfe as commercial secretary is yet to named, while Mel Stride has been named financial secretary and Liz Truss has been demoted from justice secretary to be chief secretary to the Treasury.",

      "body": "<p>A former director of Barclays Bank who has also worked as a financial regulator has been appointed City minister by Theresa May.</p> <p>Steve Barclay, who backed the Vote Leave campaign, takes over the brief for the financial district at a time when other cities across the EU are aiming to grab business from the City after Brexit.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Brussels outlined plans that could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/13/brussels-euro-uk-brexit-eu-business\">strip London of its coveted role</a> in clearing financial assets denominated in euros amid warnings this could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/23/100000-clearing-jobs-at-risk-from-brexit-vote-stock-exchange-chief\">threaten 100,000 jobs across the UK</a>. Big banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have also said they would shift jobs out of London in response to Brexit.</p> <p>The MP for North East Cambridgeshire, who was first elected in 2010, has the formal title of economic secretary to the Treasury and replaces Simon Kirby, who lost his seat in last week\u2019s election and had faced criticism while in the role.</p> <p>Barclay, <a href=\"http://stevebarclay.net/biography/\">according to his website</a>, qualified as a solicitor before working in financial regulation and then financial crime prevention. He was director of regulatory affairs and then head of anti-money laundering and sanctions in the high street banking operations of Barclays. Before Barclays he had worked at the City regulator, the Financial Services Authority, and has previously said that attempts to clean up the financial sector from money laundering were flawed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/07/city-london-status-stolen-money-haven-stain-uk-regulator-mp-stephen-barclay\">In 2014</a>, Barclay said: \u201cWhen there is a high-risk multimillion-pound transaction, the bank files a suspicious activity report, but 93% of the reports are never read.\u201d</p> <p>It is not yet clear what Barclay\u2019s remit will be at the Treasury. His predecessor was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/mar/02/john-mcdonnell-sets-out-labours-three-priorities-for-the-budget-politics-live\">sidelined in March</a> from overseeing Brexit\u2019s impact on financial services, when the task was handed to Lucy Neville-Rolfe, who tweeted on Tuesday that she had left the government.</p> <p>But Barclay gave a clue to his approach to his new role. Responding to a tweet congratulating him on his appointment the new City minister said: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SteveBarclay/status/874912872991793153\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thanks Iain. Be speaking up for those who create the wealth to pay for our public services. We need to champion business more in Parliament.</p>&mdash; Steve Barclay MP (@SteveBarclay) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveBarclay/status/874912872991793153\">June 14, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Miles Celic, the chief executive of lobby group TheCityUK, welcomed his appointment. \u201cIt is vital we have more champions of business representing our industry in parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we begin the Brexit negotiations, it will be essential for the government and industry to maintain a strong, open and constructive dialogue.<br></p> <p>\u201cThis includes remaining focused on effective bridging and adaptation periods to allow for a smooth, orderly Brexit, mutual market access based on mutual recognition and regulatory cooperation, and the ability to access and supply the best global talent.\u201d</p> <p>Chris Cummings, the chief executive of the Investment Association, said: \u201cAs the UK enters the Brexit negotiations, it has never been more important for the City to have a minister who really understands and champions its needs.\u201d </p> <p>Barclay will be one of the ministers working in the Treasury under Philip Hammond, who is due to give the chancellor\u2019s annual Mansion House address on Thursday. Hammond\u2019s audience of bankers will be looking for signs of any softening of the government\u2019s stance towards Brexit.</p> <p>A replacement for Lady Neville-Rolfe as commercial secretary is yet to named, while Mel Stride has been named financial secretary and Liz Truss has been demoted from justice secretary to be chief secretary to the Treasury.</p>",
