A mere 547m shares changed hands on Tuesday on the FTSE 100 compared with more than 2bn traded just under a year ago. On Monday and last Friday the volume was even lower, 411m and 467m respectively, making it the smallest level of movement outside the Christmas period this century. The end of the Olympics, the holiday period and the continuing eurozone crisis have been blamed for the low numbers, according to analysts. August is typically a quiet month for trading, with many traders on holiday, though last year was busier than usual after the US lost its AAA credit rating in a downgrade by Standard &amp; Poor's.

    "webTitle": "Standard Chartered agrees $340m settlement with US regulator over Iran", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Standard Chartered has fended off threats by a New York regulator to revoke its banking licence for alleged breaches of US sanctions. Chief executive Peter Sands is however under intense pressure after the bank agreed to pay $340m (\u00a3220m) despite insisting that it had committed only minor breaches of the rules. Barely 24 hours before the bank was due to attend a hearing with the New York department of financial services (DFS), the regulator announced the surprise settlementwhich also includes the installation a monitor for at least two years to evaluate the bank's risk controls. Inspectors from the DFS will be installed at the bank's office in New York and the bank will \"permanently install personnel\" in New York solely to ensure that it adheres to money laundering laws. Benjamin Lawsky, head of the DFS, who stunned Standard Chartered last week with damning allegations of sanctions breaches, had summoned the bank to appear at a hearing in New York at 10am local time on Wednesday. But the showdown was adjourned following the settlement, which was announced after the London market had closed. Lawsky claims that Standard Chartered schemed to hide 60,000 transactions valued at about $250bn (\u00a3160bn) which breached sanctions with Iran. Sands admitted to only 300 breaches, with a much smaller value of about $14m. Lawsky had said that he could withdraw the bank's licence but has now dropped the threat, which analysts said could protect the share price on Wednesday. However, his statement announcing the settlement insisted that both sides had agreed that the \"conduct at issue\" covered $250bn \u2013 the full amount of his original order. The fine is considerably larger than the $5m that the bank had argued its breaches should merit \u2013 although it may still rise as the DFS is only one of a number of authorities which has been investigating possible breaches. These include the Department of Justice and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (Ofac). Standard Chartered has admitted since 2010 that it has been discussing potential sanctions breaches. But the bank was unprepared for the decision by the DFS to publish its allegations while Sands was on holiday with his family. Investors' fears that it could be stripped of its New York licence and possible resignations at the top of the bank sliced almost 25% off the bank's share price. The shares have been recovering, ending on Tuesday at \u00a313.70, nearly 3% higher, but still below the \u00a316 levels from last week. A Standard Chartered spokesman told Reuters last night the settlement was \"a pragmatic decision in the best interest of shareholders and customers\". The loss of its banking licence would be more damaging than the fine, although Sands on Tuesday told the Business Standard paper in India \u2013 where the bank has a high street banking operation \u2013 that he did not believe the bank would be stripped of its ability to conduct business directly in the US. \"We hope we do not lose our licence, we don't believe we should lose our licence and we don't believe we will,\" Sands said, adding that the bank was planning for all possible outcomes. Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said: \"It has taken the nuclear option off the table and suggests the total settlement will be manageable.\" Sands joined the bank as finance director in 2002 so has been on the board through most of the 2001-07 period covered by the allegations. He was appointed chief executive in November 2006, when he was replaced as finance director by Richard Meddings, who joined the bank four years earlier and was previously head of risk. Meddings is the executive who, Lawsky claimed, made a remark to a US-based Standard Chartered executive about \"fucking Americans\" when warned about the potential breaches of sanctions. Standard Chartered insists that the remarks are inaccurate. Lawsky also hit out against accountants Deloitte, which he said had drafted a \"watered-down version\" of a report on the potential Iranian sanction breaches for Standard Chartered. Joe Echevarria, chief executive of Deloitte, told Reuters that the allegations were \"distortions of the facts\". \"It's an unfortunate choice of words that was pulled out of context,\" he said.",

Inspectors from the DFS will be installed at the bank's office in New York and the bank will \"permanently install personnel\" in New York solely to ensure that it adheres to money laundering laws.</p> <p>Benjamin Lawsky, head of the DFS, who stunned Standard Chartered last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/06/standard-chartered-iran-transactions\" title=\"\">with damning allegations of sanctions breaches</a>, had summoned the bank to appear at a hearing in New York at 10am local time on Wednesday. But the showdown was adjourned following the settlement, which was announced after the London market had closed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dfs.ny.gov/banking/ea120806.pdf\" title=\"\">Lawsky claims</a> that Standard Chartered schemed to hide 60,000 transactions valued at about $250bn (\u00a3160bn) which breached sanctions with Iran. Sands admitted to only 300 breaches, with a much smaller value of about $14m.</p> <p>Lawsky had said that he could withdraw the bank's licence but has now dropped the threat, which analysts said could protect the share price on Wednesday. However, his statement announcing the settlement insisted that both sides had agreed that the \"conduct at issue\" covered $250bn \u2013 the full amount of his original order.</p> <p>The fine is considerably larger than the $5m that the bank had argued its breaches should merit \u2013 although it may still rise as the DFS is only one of a number of authorities which has been investigating possible breaches. These include the Department of Justice and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (Ofac). Standard Chartered has admitted since 2010 that it has been discussing potential sanctions breaches.</p> <p>But the bank was unprepared for the decision by the DFS to publish its allegations while Sands was on holiday with his family. Investors' fears that it could be stripped of its New York licence and possible resignations at the top of the bank sliced almost 25% off the bank's share price. The shares have been recovering, ending on Tuesday at \u00a313.70, nearly 3% higher, but still below the \u00a316 levels from last week.</p> <p>A Standard Chartered spokesman told Reuters last night the settlement was \"a pragmatic decision in the best interest of shareholders and customers\".</p> <p>The loss of its banking licence would be more damaging than the fine, although Sands on Tuesday told the Business Standard paper in India \u2013 where the bank has a high street banking operation \u2013 that he did not believe the bank would be stripped of its ability to conduct business directly in the US.</p> <p>\"We hope we do not lose our licence, we don't believe we should lose our licence and we don't believe we will,\" Sands said, adding that the bank was planning for all possible outcomes.</p> <p>Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said: \"It has taken the nuclear option off the table and suggests the total settlement will be manageable.\"</p> <p>Sands joined the bank as finance director in 2002 so has been on the board through most of the 2001-07 period covered by the allegations. He was appointed chief executive in November 2006, when he was replaced as finance director by Richard Meddings, who joined the bank four years earlier and was previously head of risk.</p> <p>Meddings is the executive who, Lawsky claimed, made a remark to a US-based Standard Chartered executive about \"fucking Americans\" when warned about the potential breaches of sanctions. Standard Chartered insists that the remarks are inaccurate.</p> <p>Lawsky also hit out against accountants Deloitte, which he said had drafted a \"watered-down version\" of a report on the potential Iranian sanction breaches for Standard Chartered.</p> <p>Joe Echevarria, chief executive of Deloitte, told Reuters that the allegations were \"distortions of the facts\". \"It's an unfortunate choice of words that was pulled out of context,\" he said.</p>",

Better-than-expected figures from Germany and France were offset by sharp contractions elsewhere, with the Spanish, Italian, Finnish and Portuguese economies all shrinking. The wider European Union also suffered a 0.2% contraction.</p> <p>Europe's debt crisis is hitting exports, domestic sales and consumer confidence, adding to the pressure on European leaders. Last month eurozone consumer and business confidence fell for the fourth straight month, weakening significantly in France, Germany, Finland and Austria.</p> <p>Tim Ohlenburg, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said Europe's woes, including plunging business sentiment and weakening trade, are dragging the world economy down.</p> <p>\"The fall in second quarter European output adds to the world economy's downward momentum,\" Ohlenburg said.</p> <p>The US economy grew by about 0.4% during the second quarter, while Japan posted 0.3% growth. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/25/shock-gdp-fall-deepens-double-dip-recession\" title=\"\">The UK, though, shrank by 0.7%</a>, according to last month's preliminary estimate from the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said Europe's shrinking economy was a worry, but pointed out that only two members of the G20 \u2013 the UK and Italy \u2013 are in recession.</p> <p>\"These are concerning growth figures, with the eurozone economy contracting in the last quarter. But they also show that despite all the problems in the euro area, France and Germany have so far managed to avoid recession, while Britain has now been in recession for the last nine months.\"</p> <p>The eurozone has avoided entering a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, because growth was flat over the first three months of 2012. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight predicted that GDP will fall again during the current quarter. Archer said the eurozone was \"struggling against tight fiscal policy in many countries, high and rising unemployment, muted global economic activity and ongoing serious sovereign debt tensions that weigh down on confidence and limit investment.\"</p> <p>Stock markets, however, were cheered by the news as the contraction was smaller than expected and share prices rose across Europe. The FTSE 100 finished 32 points higher at 5864, while the DAX closed 0.8% higher.</p> <p>The European commission vice-president, Olli Rehn, told CNBC that the EU and the European Central Bank would take action \"once certain conditions are met\". Rehn added that the euro was \"irreversible\".</p> <p>In Germany, there was some relief that the economy grew by 0.3%. Analysts, though, fear that Europe's powerhouse could slide into recession soon.</p> <p>\"The German economy could contract in the summer,\" said J\u00f6rg Kramer of Commerzbank. \"It is fundamentally in good structural shape, but can't decouple from the recession in the eurozone, plus the global economy has also shifted down a gear.\"</p> <p>With no growth in the last quarter, France has now been flatlining for the last nine months.

      "bodyText": "The eurozone is on the brink of following Britain into a double-dip recession after its economy shrank between April and June. GDP across the 17-nation bloc fell by 0.2% in the second quarter of this year and economists believe the downturn is continuing. Better-than-expected figures from Germany and France were offset by sharp contractions elsewhere, with the Spanish, Italian, Finnish and Portuguese economies all shrinking. The wider European Union also suffered a 0.2% contraction. Europe's debt crisis is hitting exports, domestic sales and consumer confidence, adding to the pressure on European leaders. Last month eurozone consumer and business confidence fell for the fourth straight month, weakening significantly in France, Germany, Finland and Austria. Tim Ohlenburg, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said Europe's woes, including plunging business sentiment and weakening trade, are dragging the world economy down. \"The fall in second quarter European output adds to the world economy's downward momentum,\" Ohlenburg said. The US economy grew by about 0.4% during the second quarter, while Japan posted 0.3% growth. The UK, though, shrank by 0.7%, according to last month's preliminary estimate from the Office for National Statistics. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said Europe's shrinking economy was a worry, but pointed out that only two members of the G20 \u2013 the UK and Italy \u2013 are in recession. \"These are concerning growth figures, with the eurozone economy contracting in the last quarter. But they also show that despite all the problems in the euro area, France and Germany have so far managed to avoid recession, while Britain has now been in recession for the last nine months.\" The eurozone has avoided entering a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, because growth was flat over the first three months of 2012. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight predicted that GDP will fall again during the current quarter. Archer said the eurozone was \"struggling against tight fiscal policy in many countries, high and rising unemployment, muted global economic activity and ongoing serious sovereign debt tensions that weigh down on confidence and limit investment.\" Stock markets, however, were cheered by the news as the contraction was smaller than expected and share prices rose across Europe. The FTSE 100 finished 32 points higher at 5864, while the DAX closed 0.8% higher. The European commission vice-president, Olli Rehn, told CNBC that the EU and the European Central Bank would take action \"once certain conditions are met\". Rehn added that the euro was \"irreversible\". In Germany, there was some relief that the economy grew by 0.3%. Analysts, though, fear that Europe's powerhouse could slide into recession soon. \"The German economy could contract in the summer,\" said J\u00f6rg Kramer of Commerzbank. \"It is fundamentally in good structural shape, but can't decouple from the recession in the eurozone, plus the global economy has also shifted down a gear.\" With no growth in the last quarter, France has now been flatlining for the last nine months. The finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, said the performance was \"not excellent\", but was encouraged that France continued to avoid a recession. Moscovici said President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's government was determined to shrink the public sector deficit to 3% of GDP next year as promised, despite the fragile economy. The government needs to find \u20ac33bn in new taxes and spending cuts, even if growth meets its target of 1.2% next year, which most economists think is unlikely. Louise Cooper of BGC Partners warned that Hollande and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, should not be overly jubilant. \"This data does not change the economic outlook for the eurozone, it just gives the politicians a few weeks to breathe and holiday a little easier,\" said Cooper. Merkel returned from her summer break on Monday and is due to discuss the crisis with Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, on Wednesday. Portugal continued to be buffeted by the austerity programme now being implemented. Its GDP tumbled by 1.2% in the latest quarter and is 3.3% smaller than a year ago, while the unemployment rate crept up to a new record of 15%. Greece, whose economy shrank by 6.2% over the last year, sold more than \u20ac4bn of short-term debt, easing fears that it would struggle to repay a \u20ac3.2bn bond which matures next Monday. Spanish banks borrow record \u20ac402bn Spanish banks borrowed a record \u20ac402bn (\u00a3316bn) from the European Central Bank in July, leaving them as far as ever from returning to capital markets, and heaping further pressure on Madrid as it tries to avert a full sovereign bailout. The banks borrowed 10% more than the \u20ac365bn they tapped in June, Tuesday's data from the Bank of Spain showed. Spiralling debt costs and balance sheets ravaged by a domestic property bubble that collapsed in 2008 have shut most domestic banks out of the bond markets. The banks' use of the ECB facility has increased sharply this year, rising from \u20ac161bn in January, and the sector was propped up in July with the promise of a European rescue package \u2013 which it has yet to tap \u2013 worth up to \u20ac100bn. The pattern is similar if less acute in Italy \u2013 like Spain at the sharp end of the eurozone debt crisis \u2013 where banks held \u20ac283bn in ECB funds in July compared with \u20ac281bn in June, Bank of Italy data showed last week. In Spain, only heavyweights with big operations abroad such as Santander and BBVA continue to have few problems raising funding from the market. One likely factor in the July increase was the higher charges that some clearing houses were levying on the use of Spanish bonds \u2013 which many domestic banks have invested heavily in \u2013 as collateral for raising funds, one analyst said. LCH.Clearnet, one of Europe's largest clearing houses, raised the cost of using Spanish debt as collateral in July following a series of ratings downgrades on the country's debt to the lower end of the investment grade spectrum. Many investors fear that cleaning up the banking system as well as Spain's public accounts while recession rages may prove too difficult for the government, and expect the country to seek a full-blown bailout on top of the banking aid.",

There was certainly more action than Monday's lacklustre performance but the number of shares sold across the leading index were at historically low levels. A mere 547m shares changed hands today, compared with, for example, the 2bn that changed hands just under a year ago on 9th August. Clearly, the Olympics coming to an end has played a part and we are in August after all, but it seems the eurozone crisis and the lack of clear and decisive action from politicians has spooked the few traders that are not sunning themselves on a C\u00f4te d'Azur beach into sitting on their hands. Yesterday saw an even poorer set of trading volumes, 411m, and Friday at 467m, making these the lowest levels in more than a decade, outside the Christmas period. Brenda Kelly, senior market strategist at CMC Markets, explained: When there are low volumes it does tend to make you a little dubious about the longevity of any upward trends and I think the real thing that could change that upward move is a decision made on the ESM.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A sharp rise in air fares and less discounting at clothes shops pushed up inflation in the UK to 2.6% last month, intensifying the squeeze on household budgets. City economists had forecast an easing in consumer price inflation but instead the annual rate rose from 2.4% in June, the first increase since March. There was bad news for rail commuters, with fares now set to go up by 6.2% in January, pushing many season tickets above \u00a35,000 for commuters in south-east England. This is because retail price inflation (RPI), a broader measure which includes housing costs, jumped to 3.2% in July from 2.8% in June. Brendan Barber, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: \"This shock rise in inflation is a body blow to workers in need of respite after two years of falling wages. \"Last week the Bank [of England] said the UK economy would improve as real incomes started to grow. Today's news will knock back the recovery even further into the future. \"And there is a further shock in store for rail commuters, who could see the price of their season ticket going up three times faster than their pay rise.\" The figures, released by the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday, cast some doubt over how quickly inflation will fall in coming months. The Bank of England slashed its inflation forecast last week, projecting that CPI would fall close to its 2% target by the end of the year. Air fares soared 21.7% between June and July, the biggest increase since 2004, mainly for flights to European destinations as some people fled London to escape the predicted Olympics-related travel chaos (which never materialised). In addition, the monthly fall in clothes and shoe prices was the smallest between June and July since records began in 1996. Retailers started their summer sales early in June to shift their seasonal ranges following unusually wet weather. Higher food prices \u2013 caused by grain and sugar price rises due to bad harvests \u2013 along with rising oil and petrol prices also threaten to drive inflation higher in coming months. However, some economists think the pickup in inflation is just a blip and that the weak economy will push prices down. \"We really need to take the June and July figures together and this implies that the downward trend in prices remains in place,\" said James Knightley, UK economist at ING. \"The rise in oil prices and food commodities presents some risks for headline inflation in coming months, but with the weak economy implying only limited corporate pricing power we still expect inflation to fall below 2% by the end of the year.\"",
